A Sparse Target Matrix Generation Based Unsupervised Feature Learning Algorithm for Image Classification,2018,"['Neural network', 'unsupervised learning', 'sparse feature', 'classification']",,"Unsupervised learning has shown good performance on image, video and audio classification tasks, and much progress has been made so far. It studies how systems can learn to represent particular input patterns in a way that reflects the statistical structure of the overall collection of input patterns. Many promising deep learning systems are commonly trained by the greedy layerwise unsupervised learning manner. The performance of these deep learning architectures benefits from the unsupervised learning ability to disentangling the abstractions and picking out the useful features. However, the existing unsupervised learning algorithms are often difficult to train partly because of the requirement of extensive hyperparameters. The tuning of these hyperparameters is a laborious task that requires expert knowledge, rules of thumb or extensive search. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective unsupervised feature learning algorithm for image classification, which exploits an explicit optimizing way for population and lifetime sparsity. Firstly, a sparse target matrix is built by the competitive rules. Then, the sparse features are optimized by means of minimizing the Euclidean norm (L<sub>2</sub>) error between the sparse target and the competitive layer outputs. Finally, a classifier is trained using the obtained sparse features. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves good performance for image classification, and provides discriminative features that generalize well.",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
Scalable and Unsupervised Feature Engineering Using Vibration-Imaging and Deep Learning for Rotor System Diagnosis,2018,,,"<P>This paper proposes a scalable and unsupervised feature engineering method that uses vibration imaging and deep learning. For scalability, a vibration imaging approach is devised that incorporates data from systems with various scales, such as small testbeds and real field-deployed systems. Moreover, a deep learning approach is proposed for unsupervised feature engineering. The overall procedure includes three key steps: 1) vibration image generation; 2) unsupervised feature extraction; and 3) fault classifier design. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, three case studies are conducted using an RK4 rotor kit and a power plant journal bearing system. By incorporating smaller-system data as well as real-system data, the proposed approach can substantially increase the applicability of the fault diagnosis method while maintaining good accuracy. Moreover, the time and effort needed to develop a diagnostic approach for other rotor systems can be reduced considerably.</P>",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
A New Application of Unsupervised Learning to Nighttime Sea Fog Detection,2018,"['Sea fog detection', 'COMS', 'CALIPSO', 'Unsupervised learning', 'EMalgorithm']",,"This paper presents a nighttime sea fog detection algorithm incorporating unsupervised learning technique. The algorithm is based on data sets that combine brightness temperatures from the 3.7 μm and 10.8 μm channels of the meteorological imager (MI) onboard the Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), with sea surface temperature from the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA). Previous algorithms generally employed threshold values including the brightness temperature difference between the near infrared and infrared. The threshold values were previously determined from climatological analysis or model simulation. Although this method using predetermined thresholds is very simple and effective in detecting low cloud, it has difficulty in distinguishing fog from stratus because they share similar characteristics of particle size and altitude. In order to improve this, the unsupervised learning approach, which allows a more effective interpretation from the insufficient information, has been utilized. The unsupervised learning method employed in this paper is the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm that is widely used in incomplete data problems. It identifies distinguishing features of the data by organizing and optimizing the data. This allows for the application of optimal threshold values for fog detection by considering the characteristics of a specific domain. The algorithm has been evaluated using the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) vertical profile products, which showed promising results within a local domain with probability of detection (POD) of 0.753 and critical success index (CSI) of 0.477, respectively.",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
Design of Digital CMOS Neuromorphic IC with Current-starved SRAM Synapse for Unsupervised Stochastic Learning,2018,"['Spiking neural network (SNN)', 'spike-timing', 'dependent plasticity (STDP)', 'unsupervised learning', 'neural networks']",,"This paper proposes a current-starved SRAM circuit for use as a synapse to support a biological learning of spike-timing dependent plasticity. If the driving strength of SRAM is limited both when writing a new state and restoring the previous state, then programming the opposite synaptic weight requires several densely-repeated write operations. The synapse takes only stochastically-meaningful stimuli for training, and rejects random and noisy inputs; as a result it achieves successful learning even with binary SRAM. The proposed synapse is applied to a three-layer neuromorphic network of spiking neurons that includes a receptive synaptic array and a projective synaptic array. The network is designed with a 28-nm digital CMOS process. Applying an unsupervised learning to only the projective synapses with the receptive synapses fixed at randomly given, the network successfully memorizes multiple overlapped image patterns and recalls the trained patterns if the images are distorted.",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
An Unsupervised Real-time Anomaly Detection of Furnace System based on HTM,2018,"['Anomaly detection', 'Real-time', 'Unsupervised', 'Furnace systems', 'HTM', 'Machine learning']",,"The immediate recognition of abnormal temperatures in the furnace system is very important for timely disaster control. Conventional abnormal temperature detection techniques typically use pre-programmed thresholds to identify abnormal patterns from a stream of temperature data in a statistical manner. Therefore, it is not suitable for use in a heating furnace system in which abnormal patterns must be detected in real time. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is one of the machine learning models with excellent ability to analyze patterns of stream data. This model is a new machine intelligence technique that uses unsupervised continuous learning using Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA), which is a time-based learning algorithm, and Spare Distributed Representation (SDR), which stores temporal and spatial patterns. This HTM, which is distinguished from existing deep learning or artificial neural network model, is capable of real-time continuous prediction from input of stream data and can be used to recognize abnormal states in various fields. HTM can be used as a robust model to detect abnormalities in successive temperature data in a heating furnace system because the furnace system continues to generate temperature stream data with a certain pattern over time. Here we developed an HTM-based, unsupervised, real-time anomaly detection system for heating furnaces. Performance evaluation shows that the suggested system can perform excellent abnormal real-time detection.",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
Principal component pyramids for manifold learning in hand shape recognition,2018,"['Principal component analysis', 'Data pyramids', 'Multidimensional grids', 'Multilayer neural networks']",,"This paper presents two algorithms using data pyramids for hand shape recognition in Irish Sign Language. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used as a feature extraction and dimensionality reduction method. Originally, the problem is nonlinear and it is hard for PCA to extract the underlying structure of the data. The proposed PCA pyramids provide an alternative to nonlinear PCA as they depend on dividing the space into subspaces which are approximately linear using the appropriate eigenspace in each level. They are used to accelerate the search process to approximate the nearest neighbour search problem. The first algorithm uses unsupervised multidimensional grids to cluster the space into cells of similar objects. The second algorithm is based on training a set of simple architecture multilayer neural networks. Experimental results are given to measure the accuracy and performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison with the exhaustive search scenario. The proposed algorithms are applicable for real time applications with high accuracy measures.",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

However, binary classification model determines only the presence or absence of faults in the module without considering the complex characteristics of the fault, and supervised model has the limitation that it requires a training data set that most development groups do not have. To solve these two problems, this paper proposes severity-based ternary classification model using unsupervised learning algorithms, and experimental results show that the proposed model has comparable performance to the supervised models.",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Collecting sufficient labeled data is an expensive and time-consuming task. To build a HAR system in a new environment (i.e., the target domain) with very limited labeled data, it is unfavorable to naively exploit the data or trained classifier model from the existing environment (i.e., the source domain) as it is due to the domain difference. While traditional machine learning approaches are unable to address such distribution mismatch, transfer learning approach leverages the utilization of knowledge from existing well-established source domains that help to build an accurate classifier in the target domain. In this work, we propose a transfer learning approach to create an accurate HAR classifier with very limited data through the multitask neural network. The classifier loss function minimization for source and target domain are treated as two different tasks. The knowledge transfer is performed by simultaneously minimizing the loss function of both tasks using a single neural network model. Furthermore, we utilize the unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner to help the model training. The experiment result shows that the proposed work consistently outperforms existing approaches.",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Thus, complex data can be easily classified, but the amount of learning computation and memory increases due to increase of the number of weights. Deep learning, which requires a lot of computation and memory, usually is trained on cloud environments. However, the cloud environment must be maintained in good communication state with user and have burden on service cost and risk of leakage of personal information. To solve this problem, deep learning needs to be learnt on the embedded device, and be light-weighting. Pruning and quantization methods are widely used for the light-weighting. Existing quantization methods usually use K-means, one of the unsupervised learning methods, in order to determine representative values of clustering weights. In the K-means method, the number of groups is set through trial-and-error method, which results in the computation overhead. To alleviate the overhead, we propose an instant weight quantization method using statistical information of weights Also, it can improve learning performance by quantizing sequentially with considering the dependency between layers in the network.",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

One is the question of whether AI has conceptual competence, and the other is whether AI has capacity to act. Conceptual competence is a necessary condition for AI to be able to properly understand commands and information given in ordinary human language and reflect them in its operation. A recent paper reports the success of AI in discerning objects of a specific category via unsupervised learning. But such ability implies neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition of conceptual competence. We could try to make AI share the conceptual understanding as we have, by way of feeding it the whole body of linguistic practice of human society, which is not impossible but hard to complete in reality. The assessment of capacity to act is, on the other hand, the key to the question of whether AI can be regarded as agent with certain amount of responsibilities and rights. Action is interaction between the agent and its environment. Realization of an action requires successful coordination of patient system and agent system. There is a self behind this coordination, whose intention initiates and drives the whole process. Action is thus the process of realizing the intention of the self through coordination of patient system and agent system. As there is no reason to say that the operation of artifacts meets these conditions, the answers to both questions of this paper are negative.",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Uncertain fuzzy self-organization based clustering: interval type-2 fuzzy approach to adaptive resonance theory,2018,"['Adaptive resonance theory', 'Fuzzy ART', 'Unsupervised learning', 'Interval type-2 fuzzy clustering', 'Vigilance parameter', 'Type reduction']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Conventional unsupervised learning algorithms require knowledge of the desired number of clusters beforehand. Even if such knowledge is not required in advance, empirical selection of the parameter values may limit the adaptive capability of the algorithm, thereby restricting the clustering performance. An inherent uncertainty in the number and size of clusters requires integration of fuzzy sets into a clustering algorithm. In this paper, we propose a type-1 (T1) fuzzy ART method that adaptively selects the vigilance parameter value, which is critical in determining the network dynamics. This results in improved clustering performance due to the added flexibility in dynamic selection of the number of clusters with the use of fuzzy sets. To further manage the uncertainty associated with memberships, we extend the proposed T1 fuzzy ART with adaptive vigilance to an interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy ART method. Type reduction and defuzzification are then performed using the KM algorithm to obtain a defuzzified vigilance parameter value. We evaluate our proposed methods on several data sets to validate their effectiveness.</P>",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

We attempt to automatically detect and identify possible relations among the entities based on clustering without training data, as opposed to the relation extraction approach that focuses on improvement of accuracy in selecting one of the several target relations for a given pair of entities. While the relation extraction approach with supervised learning requires a significant amount of annotation efforts for a predefined set of relations, our approach attempts to discover relations as they occur naturally. Unlike other unsupervised relation identification work where evaluation of automatically identified relations is done with the correct relations determined a priori by human judges, we attempted to evaluate appropriateness of the naturally occurring clusters of relations involving person-artifact and person-organization entities and their relation names.",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Binarization of degraded document images based on hierarchical deep supervised network,2018,"['Document image binarization', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Document analysis']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The binarization of degraded document images is a challenging problem in terms of document analysis. Binarization is a classification process in which intra-image pixels are assigned to either of the two following classes: foreground text and background. Most of the algorithms are constructed on low-level features in an unsupervised manner, and the consequent disenabling of full utilization of input-domain knowledge considerably limits distinguishing of background noises from the foreground. In this paper, a novel supervised-binarization method is proposed, in which a hierarchical deep supervised network (DSN) architecture is learned for the prediction of the text pixels at different feature levels. With higher-level features, the network can differentiate text pixels from background noises, whereby severe degradations that occur in document images can be managed. Alternatively, foreground maps that are predicted at lower-level features present a higher visual quality at the boundary area. Compared with those of traditional algorithms, binary images generated by our architecture have cleaner background and better-preserved strokes.

In addition, if we build and provide an event network based on the relevance of events, it will be able to greatly help the reader in understanding the current events.In this study, we propose a method for extracting event networks from large news text data. To this end, we first collected Korean political and social articles from March 2016 to March 2017, and integrated the synonyms by leaving only meaningful words through preprocessing using NPMI and Word2Vec. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling was used to calculate the subject distribution by date and to find the peak of the subject distribution and to detect the event. A total of 32 topics were extracted from the topic modeling, and the point of occurrence of the event was deduced by looking at the point at which each subject distribution surged. As a result, a total of 85 events were detected, but the final 16 events were filtered and presented using the Gaussian smoothing technique. We also calculated the relevance score between events detected to construct the event network. Using the cosine coefficient between the co-occurred events, we calculated the relevance between the events and connected the events to construct the event network. Finally, we set up the event network by setting each event to each vertex and the relevance score between events to the vertices connecting the vertices. The event network constructed in our methods helped us to sort out major events in the political and social fields in Korea that occurred in the last one year in chronological order and at the same time identify which events are related to certain events.Our approach differs from existing event detection methods in that LDA topic modeling makes it possible to easily analyze large amounts of data and to identify the relevance of events that were difficult to detect in existing event detection. We applied various text mining techniques and Word2vec technique in the text preprocessing to improve the accuracy of the extraction of proper nouns and synthetic nouns, which have been difficult in analyzing existing Korean texts, can be found.In this study, the detection and network configuration techniques of the event have the following advantages in practical application. First, LDA topic modeling, which is unsupervised learning, can easily analyze subject and topic words and distribution from huge amount of data. Also, by using the date information of the collected news articles, it is possible to express the distribution by topic in a time series.Second, we can find out the connection of events in the form of present and summarized form by calculating relevance score and constructing event network by using simultaneous occurrence of topics that are difficult to grasp in existing event detection. It can be seen from the fact that the inter-event relevance-based event network proposed in this study was actually constructed in order of occurrence time. It is also possible to identify what happened as a starting point for a series of events through the event network.The limitation of this study is that the characteristics of LDA topic modeling have different results according to the initial parameters and the number of subjects, and the subject and event name of the analysis result should be given by the subjective judgment of the researcher. Also, since each topic is assumed to be exclusive and independent, it does not take into account the relevance between themes. Subsequent studies need to calculate the relevance between events that are not covered...",unsupervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
k-NN Join Based on LSH in Big Data Environment,2018,"['Big data', 'High dimension', 'k-NN join', 'LSH', 'Spark']",,"k-Nearest neighbor join (k-NN Join) is a computationally intensive algorithm that is designed to find k-nearest neighbors from a dataset S for every object in another dataset R. Most related studies on k-NN Join are based on single-computer operations. As the data dimensions and data volume increase, running the k-NN Join algorithm on a single computer cannot generate results quickly. To solve this scalability problem, we introduce the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) k-NN Join algorithm implemented in Spark, an approach for high-dimensional big data. LSH is used to map similar data onto the same bucket, which can reduce the data search scope. In order to achieve parallel implementation of the algorithm on multiple computers, the Spark framework is used to accelerate the computation of distances between objects in a cluster. Results show that our proposed approach is fast and accurate for high-dimensional and big data.",k-NN_2018_academic_riss.csv

Constraints on jet quenching in p–Pb collisions at <sub> s NN </sub> = 5.02 TeV measured by the event-activity dependence of semi-inclusive hadron-jet distributions,2018,,,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The ALICE Collaboration reports the measurement of semi-inclusive distributions of charged-particle jets recoiling from a high-transverse momentum trigger hadron in p–Pb collisions at    <SUB>  s   NN  </SUB>   = 5.02  TeV. Jets are reconstructed from charged-particle tracks using the anti- <SUB>  k   T  </SUB>  algorithm with resolution parameter  R = 0.2  and 0.4. A data-driven statistical approach is used to correct the uncorrelated background jet yield. Recoil jet distributions are reported for jet transverse momentum  15 <   p   T , jet   ch   < 50  GeV / c  and are compared in various intervals of p–Pb event activity, based on charged-particle multiplicity and zero-degree neutral energy in the forward (Pb-going) direction. The semi-inclusive observable is self-normalized and such comparisons do not require the interpretation of p–Pb event activity in terms of collision geometry, in contrast to inclusive jet observables. These measurements provide new constraints on the magnitude of jet quenching in small systems at the LHC. In p–Pb collisions with high event activity, the average medium-induced out-of-cone energy transport for jets with  R = 0.4  and  15 <   p   T , jet   ch   < 50  GeV / c  is measured to be less than 0.4  GeV / c  at 90% confidence, which is over an order of magnitude smaller than a similar measurement for central Pb–Pb collisions at    <SUB>  s   NN  </SUB>   = 2.76  TeV .

However, the anchorage of CFRP cable is a big issue due to the anisotropic property of CFRP material. In this article, a high-efficient bonding anchorage with novel configuration is developed for CFRP cables. The acoustic emission (AE) technique is employed to evaluate the performance of anchorage in the fatigue test and post-fatigue ultimate bearing capacity test. The obtained AE signals are analyzed by using a combination of unsupervised K-means clustering and supervised K-nearest neighbor classification (K-NN) for quantifying the performance of the anchorage and damage evolutions. An AE feature vector (including both frequency and energy characteristics of AE signal) for clustering analysis is proposed and the under-sampling approaches are employed to regress the influence of the imbalanced classes distribution in AE dataset for improving clustering quality. The results indicate that four classes exist in AE dataset, which correspond to the shear deformation of potting compound, matrix cracking, fiber-matrix debonding and fiber fracture in CFRP bars. The AE intensity released by the deformation of potting compound is very slight during the whole loading process and no obvious premature damage observed in CFRP bars aroused by anchorage effect at relative low stress level, indicating the anchorage configuration in this study is reliable.",k-NN_2018_academic_riss.csv

Background: Pilots can experience high cognitive workload conditions by performing various tasks simultaneously during air operation mission. Accurate detection of the cognitive workload state is required to improve the survivability of pilots and ensure flight safety.  Method: Five student pilots in 20s performed dual task consisting of simulated flight task with baseline task and three levels of N-back task (0-back, 1-back, 2-back). Three flight performance features (standard deviation of altitude, heading, airspeed) and two heart rate variability features (standard deviation of NN (SDNN), Low Frequency to High Frequency ratio (LF/HF)) were measured from the flight simulation experiment with photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor. Cognitive workload classification model was developed by pre-processing input features and output classes, applying five classifiers (Decision tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Bayesian, Ensemble), and validating the model performance.  Results: High cognitive workload level (2-back) was 327%, 161%, and 1.2% higher than baseline in terms of standard deviation of altitude, standard deviation of airspeed, and LF/HF respectively.

Since CPDP employs different project data collected from other organization to build a classifier, the main obstacle to build an accurate classifier is that distributions between source and target projects are not similar. To address the problem, because it is crucial to identify effective similarity measure techniques to obtain high performance for CPDP, In this paper, we aim to identify them.

Afterwards, the server tests its ANN model whenever the client reports drone detection. The accuracy rate of client's PIL test is 83% and server's ANN test accuracy rate is 86%. The major deliverables of this work are a software package framework one may use to train its ANN model with various sound samples from different places to make a generalized drone detection model.",k-NN_2018_academic_riss.csv
First measurement of jet mass in Pb–Pb and p–Pb collisions at the LHC,2018,,,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>This letter presents the first measurement of jet mass in Pb–Pb and p–Pb collisions at    <SUB>  s   NN  </SUB>   = 2.76  TeV and    <SUB>  s   NN  </SUB>   = 5.02  TeV, respectively. Both the jet energy and the jet mass are expected to be sensitive to jet quenching in the hot Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) matter created in nuclear collisions at collider energies. Jets are reconstructed from charged particles using the anti- <SUB>  k   T  </SUB>  jet algorithm and resolution parameter  R = 0.4 . The jets are measured in the pseudorapidity range  | <SUB>  η   jet  </SUB> | < 0.5  and in three intervals of transverse momentum between 60 GeV/<I>c</I> and 120 GeV/<I>c</I>. The measurement of the jet mass in central Pb–Pb collisions is compared to the jet mass as measured in p–Pb reference collisions, to vacuum event generators, and to models including jet quenching. It is observed that the jet mass in central Pb–Pb collisions is consistent within uncertainties with p–Pb reference measurements. Furthermore, the measured jet mass in Pb–Pb collisions is not reproduced by the quenching models considered in this letter and is found to be consistent with PYTHIA expectations within systematic uncertainties.</P>",k-NN_2018_academic_riss.csv

The obtained information is processed according to the characteristics of the pattern using a Motor Insulation Monitoring System program. At this time, the processed data are total 4 types that void discharge, corona discharge, surface discharge and slot discharge. The partial discharge data with high dimensional input variables are secondarily processed by principal component analysis method and reduced with keeping the characteristics of pattern as low dimensional input variables. And therefore, the pattern classifier processing speed exhibits improved effects. In addition, in the process of extracting the partial discharge data through the MIMS program, the magnitude of amplitude is divided into the maximum value and the average value, and two pattern characteristics are set and compared and analyzed. In the first half of the proposed partial discharge pattern classifier, the input and hidden layers are classified by using the K-means clustering method and the output of the hidden layer is obtained. In the latter part, the cross entropy error function is used for parameter learning between the hidden layer and the output layer. The final output layer is output as a normalized probability value between 0 and 1 using the softmax function. The advantage of using the softmax function is that it allows access and application of multiple class problems and stochastic interpretation. First of all, there is an advantage that one output value affects the remaining output value and its accompanying learning is accelerated. Also, to solve the overfitting problem, L2-normalization is applied.

Incremental basis estimation adopting global k-means algorithm for NMF-based noise reduction,2018,"['Nonnegative matrix factorization', 'Basis training', 'Incremental approach', 'Global k-means', 'Source separation']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a data decomposition technique enabling to discover meaningful latent nonnegative components. Since, however, the objective function of NMF is non-convex, the performance of the source separation can degrade when the iterative update of the basis matrix in the training procedure is stuck to a poor local minimum. In most of the previous studies, the whole basis matrix for a specific source is iteratively updated to minimize a certain objective function with random initialization although a few approaches have been proposed for the systematic initialization of the basis matrix such as the singular value decomposition and k-means clustering. In this paper, we propose an approach to robust bases estimation in which an incremental strategy is adopted. Based on an analogy between clustering and NMF analysis, we estimate the NMF bases in a similar way to the global k-means algorithm popular in the data clustering area. Experiments on audio separation from noise showed that the proposed methods outperformed the conventional NMF technique using random initialization by about 2.04dB and 2.34dB in signal-to-distortion ratio when the target source was speech and violin, respectively.</P>",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

First, we examine the relationship between analyst coverage and accounting conservatism, and then examine whether K-IFRS adoption has a significant effect on the relationship between analyst coverage and accounting conservatism. Conservatism is measured by the method of Ball and Shivakumar (2008) and Khan and Watts (2009). Analyst coverage is measured as the total number of analysts who issue earnings forecasts and the natural logarithm after adding 1 to the number of analysts who issue earnings forecasts.The most significant changes in the adoption of K-IFRS are the principle-based standard framework, introduction of consolidated financial statements as basic financial statements, and the expansion of fair value. This suggests that there will be a change in environment of analysts and accounting conservatism of managers due to characteristic accounting environment change.Introduction of consolidated financial statements as basic financial statements and the principle-based standard framework are expected to cause additional costs to analysts who need to interpret additional information, and the increase in the annotation disclosure due to the principle-based framework and the expansion of the fair value are expected to improve the information environment by providing additional information to the analyst. Meanwhile, in the K-IFRS ‘conceptual framework for financial reporting’, the word ‘conservatism’ has been replaced by ‘prudence’, but from 2012, it has been removed from the qualitative characteristics of accounting information. Accordingly, the adoption of K-IFRS will reduce the bias of underestimation of net assets by showing the fair value of the economic condition of firms (Joyong et al., 2014). In addition, accounting conservatism is expected to decrease due to the characteristics of K-IFRS, which emphasizes relevance rather than a faithful representation of information.Our study is meaningful in that it examines whether the analysts fully understand the change of accounting environment and perform the forecasting activities, and whether those appropriate monitor the change of accounting conservatism of the forecasting company. Thus, we examine whether financial analysts accept the decline in accounting conservatism due to the adoption of K-IFRS and apply them appropriately to the forecasting activities of the firms.The empirical results of our study are as follows. First, there is a significant positive (+) association between analyst coverage and accounting conservatism. This means that firms adopt more conservative accounting when they are followed by more analysts than when they are followed by fewer analysts. These results are consistent with domestic and foreign studies that examined the association between analyst coverage and accounting conservatism in the pre-K-IFRS period (Sun and Liu 2011; Oh et al., 2013). Second, the adoption of K-IFRS has a significant negative (-) effect on the association between analyst coverage and accounting conservatism. This indicates that analysts are well aware of the changes in the accounting environment caused by the adoption of K-IFRS, and are used appropriately in forecasting for firms. In addition, these findings suggest that high analyst coverage may lead to high accounting conservatism if analyst coverage serves as a corporate governance role.Our study contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, our study concurrently considers the association between analyst coverage, conservatism, and K-IFRS as a determinant of accounting conservatism, and directly examine the effect of K-IFRS adoption on the association between analyst coverage and accounting conservatism. Second, our study suggests that analysts who play ...",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The Korean Idols also have positive effects on Korean culture. They spread new wave of korean culture activities to the international world. For instance, growing numbers of the international fans have interested in learning korean language to understand K-pop culture. Their musics can connect fans around the world and make people share ideas and messages. In this respect, understanding the impacts of the contemporary designs related to K-pop culture is important as a means of communication platform. So the K-pop fans are leading a new world of fandom and creating new design trends in terms of the symbolic aspects. This Study, in these respect, investigates a graphic symbol of K-pop boy and girl groups in the age of new korean wave. K-pop has been impacted on the music industry, dance, performance and fashion field, also on the fandom as well. Moreover, K-pop spread not only among korean, but also out toward the abroad growing as an international symbolic icon.

Rahner’s argues that the divine nature of human beings is transcendent, therefore any human being is an anonymous christian. In this article, Rahner has examined the phenomenon of divine phenomena claimed by Rahner.The transcendence of divinity tells humans that human beings have become human beings to cultivate and transcend their uniqueness. Because of this transcendence, human transcendence is beyond historical circumstances. It is not left as a separate part of life and is involved in historical circumcision.Historically, it's called the ‘transcendental Experience.’ The relationship between the sexes refers to the status of a human being in a way that can relate to God. Because God is a part of the ‘Self-sufficiency’ that God gave to humans, God is a human nature. Based on the divine nature, you can't fully understand the God’s, but you can’t fully understand God.There’s a relationship that can be found and figured out. It has a relationship that can’t be separated from human beings.Transcendental existence, it’s a human existence. Beyond death, it means that you’re already connected to God, and if you don’t have a connection with God, the divine nature of a transcendent nature should not be sustainable.The persistence of divinity is meaningful and persistent, and it is divine. It appears as a metaphor for God who wants to maintain relationships with humans and interact with humans.And as a persistence, divine identity is God.

Although previous studies have focused on male K-pop stars as the object of heterosexual desire, the phenomenon of “fan cosplay,” or “fancos” for short, demonstrates that these male stars also serve as a means for cross-gender identification for female fans. This paper explores K-pop’s role as a space for its young female fans to explore gender and sexual identity, as well as its influence on local queer subculture in terms of gendered styling, gendered pairing, and queer terminology. Furthermore, an examination of the historical changes in the popularity of fancos reveals the transformation in the recognition of homosexuality and its backlash in Korea as well as the strategies of the queer subculture to focus on invisibility and in-group differentiation. Therefore, a queer perspective on K-pop studies includes domestic queer fans in the study of K-pop, complicates the heteronormative assumptions of fandom studies, and the relationship between commercial media and desire and sheds light on sexual politics in South Korea.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Specifically, our concern is to examine hypertension suspicious (prehypertension) patients who might develop their symptoms to established hypertension in the future. The proposed method uses fuzzy C-means clustering as quantization engine with careful seeding of the number of clusters from histogram analysis. The experiment verifies that the proposed method is feasible in that the successful extraction rates are 96% (successful in 48 out of 50 test cases) and demonstrated better performance than K-means based method in specificity and sensitivity analysis but the proposed method should be further refined as the retrospective analysis pointed out.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

We have been thinking about the limitation of oral history arising from the fact that it is written and used by letters. In order to overcome this limitation, we conducted an experimental class in which we produced a verbatim theatre play that combined oral history and play. It was a class specifically on conducting interviews with descendants of Korean independence activists and making a play based on these interviews. The interviewees were the descendants of Kim Kyu-sik, Yun Bong-gil, Lee Hoe-yeong, Jung Jeong-hwa and Jo So-ang. Five history students and ten theatre students attended the class. They were divided into five groups. Each group consisted of one history student and two theatre students. The groups explored the life of an independence activist, interviewed with his or her descendant, and made a script for a 10-minute play. And they themselves performed the play on stage. The interviewees attended the performance and shared the meaning of the play which represented their voices with the students and audiences. This work has been highly successful in the following respects. First, it is not only possible but also effective to deliver oral history not by letters but by oral representation. Second, the verbatim theatre which uses transcripts of oral history interviews could be a very useful and effective means of overcoming the alienation of interviewees and honoring their lives with many audiences. Third, the performance of oral history could be effectively linked to the accumulation of interview data. Fourth, the link between oral history and education could achieve positive effects not only on history education but also on social education, practical education, emotional education and communication between generations.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Stable Ferroelectric Behavior of Nb-Modified Bi0.5K0.5TiO3-Bi(Mg0.5Ti0.5)O3 Lead-Free Relaxor Ferroelectric Ceramics,2018,,,"<P>Crystal structure, dielectric, ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and electric field-induced strain properties of lead-free Nb-modified 0.96Bi(0.5)K(0.5)TiO(3)-0.04Bi(Mg0.5Ti0.5)O-3 (BKT-BMT) piezoelectric ceramics were investigated. Crystal structure analysis showed a gradual phase transition from tetragonal to pseudocubic phase with increasing Nb content. The optimal piezoelectric property of small-signal d (33) was enhanced up to similar to 68 pC/N with a lower coercive field (E (c)) of similar to 22 kV/cm and an improved remnant polarization (P (r)) of similar to 13 mu C/cm(2) for x = 0.020. A relaxor-like behavior with a frequency-dependent Curie temperature T (m) was observed, and a high T (m) around 320A degrees C was obtained in the investigated system. This study suggests that the ferroelectric properties of BKT-BMT was significantly improved by means of Nb substitution. The possible shift of depolarization temperature T (d) toward high temperature T (m) may have triggered the spontaneous relaxor to ferroelectric phase transition with long-range ferroelectric order without any traces of a nonergodic relaxor state in contradiction with Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based systems. The possible enhancement in ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties near the critical composition x = 0.020 may be attributed to the increased anharmonicity of lattice vibrations which may facilitate the observed phase transition from a low-symmetry tetragonal to a high-symmetry cubic phase with a decrease in the lattice anisotropy of an undoped sample. This highly flexible (at a unit cell level) narrow compositional range triggers the enhancement of d (33) and P (r) values.</P>",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

To resolve these difficulties, Dignāga discusses in PS(V) 5.14 that the exclusion of non‐blue things and that of non‐lotuses are different from each other, because the non‐blue things and the non‐loutses, which are what is to be excluded, are different from each other. Two different words with different meanings can thus have be established such relations by his original theory.Conclusionally, in PS(V) 5.36d Dignāga argues that his apoha theory is superior to (guṇotkarṣāt) other schools’ tadvat theory because of non-existence of four mistakes (doṣa) on word’s meaning (śabdārtha), and therefore a word could denote things exclusively as qualified by the exclusion of others (arthāntaranivṛttiviśiṣṭān).",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
“Home” and “Homma” in K-Pop Fandom,2018,"['K-pop', 'fandom', 'fan sites', 'Homma', 'fan culture', '케이 팝', '팬덤', '팬 사이트', '홈마', '팬 문화']","본 논문은 케이팝 팬덤에서 팬 사이트를 지칭하는 “홈”과 팬 사이트 운영자인 “홈마”에 대해 탐구한다. 일부 팬들은 전문가용 카메라를 사용하여 고화질의 사진을 촬영하며, 촬영한 케이팝 스타의 사진을 자신들이 운영하는 웹사이트에 공유한다. 이러한 웹사이트를 “홈”이라 부르며, 홈을 운영하는 팬들은 “홈마”라 한다. 본 논문의 첫 번째 목적은 홈마에게 씌워진 파파라치의 오명에 이의를 제기하는 데 있다. 이를 위해 본 논문은 우선 케이팝 팬들의 스타 사진 찍기 활동을 살핀다. 또한 케이팝 기획사가 생산하고 판매하는 공식 굿즈를 구입하고 소비하는 것 이외에 팬들이 어떻게 자체적으로 물품을 만들어내고 이런 물품이 다른 팬들 사이에서 소비되는지 살펴본다. 본 논문의 두 번째 목적은 홈을 중심으로 이루어지고 있는 사진과 관련한 팬들의 활동이 케이팝 씬에서 어떻게 문화 혹은 하위문화를 형성시키는지 보여주고자 한다. 그리하여 본 논문은 다음과 같이 주장한다. 케이팝 팬의 홈은 공인된 공식 케이팝 굿즈 생산자, 판매자를 대체하는 암시장의 기능을 하며, 홈마는 케이팝 팬덤에서 사진작가, 편집자, 웹마스터, 판매자, 후원자, 투자자를 겸하는 포괄적인 문화 생산자로서의 역할을 수행한다.","This paper examines “home” and “homma” in K-pop fandom, which mean fan sites and fan site managers respectively. Most K-pop fans, like other popular culture fans, enjoy photographing or filming their favorite musicians. Some fans, taking high quality pictures of K-pop stars with professional cameras, share these photos through their own websites, also known as “homes.” These fans, commonly nicknamed as “hommas,” and their photography are widely recognized in fandom as many other fans visit the homes to appreciate and download the good photos. However, hommas are frequently stigmatized just as paparazzi both within and outside of fandomsince they followK-pop stars’ everymove at every corner─ranging fromthe stars’ live performances at concert halls to their arrival and departure at airports─to shoot more photographs. The first objective of this paper is to challenge this negative bias against hommas. For this objective, the paper first describes how K-pop fans engage in not only shooting but also producing and consuming fan merchandise in addition to the consumption of K-pop official goods produced and sold by K-pop labels. This paper also demonstrates howthese photograph-related fan practices especially at homes can shape a form of various cultures and/or subcultures in the K-pop scene. The paper then claims that a K-pop fan’s home functions as a “blackmarket,” an alternativemarket outside of officially certified producers or sellers, as well as that a homma serves as an inclusive cultural producer embracing a photographer, editor, webmaster, seller, supporter, and investor in K-pop fandom.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Adult Playfulness Trait Scale(K-APTS; Shen, Chick, & Zinn, 2014a), a new measurement of playfulness that assesses an individual’s disposition for uninhibitedness and spontaneous fun. A total of 540 college students  participated in the survey. Confirmative factor analyses(CFA) and multiple-group CFA in M-plus 7.4, was used for the verification of construct validity, the Pearson correlation coefficients in SPSS 23.0  was used for the verification of criteria validity and Cronbach’s ɑ in SPSS 23.0  was used for the verification of reliability. The three-level construct of K-APTS was confirmed. The 19 items of K-APTS were explained by five clearly interpretable factors: fun belief, initiative, reactivity, fun belief, initiative, and reactivity. High-order factor analyses confirmed the underlying hierarchical model of K-APTS that comprises three additional sub-dimensions: fun-seeking motivation, uninhibitedness, and spontaneity, wherein fun-seeking motivation includes three sub-dimensions: fun belief, initiative, and reactivity. In third order model, one overarching construct supports the interpretation of a general “playfulness” factor underlying all subscales. Evidence of criteria validity was obtained from correlations of the K-APTS with the K-PSA. The three-level construct of K-APTS demonstrated good internal consistency. Greater playfulness in the K-APTS was associated positively with extraversion, openness to new experiences, agreeability, conscientiousness, it was negatively associated with neuroticism in K-BFI. The multi-group CFA was conducted to compare male and female samples. Given the configural invariance, the metric invariance and partial scalar invariance were held across multiple groups. The latent mean analysis examined whether the mean level of latent construct was invariant across groups. Females showed a statistically lower mean than males in the initiative(I) factor in the K-APTS.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Methods: After completing the final translation through verification, to verify the tool’s reliability and validity, 218 senior drivers, aged 65 plus, were assessed through translated versions of Drivers 65 plus, K-DBQ and MoCA-K. Results: The translated version was completed after verification of translation and reverse translation, participant comprehensibility, and suitability; no questions were deleted or added. In reliability testing of the translated version of Drivers 65 plus, the internal reliability of the items was Cronbach’s α=0.575, and test-retest reliability was .95 by ICC. In the confirmatory factor analysis to verify construct validity, the model fit indices were as follows: NC=2.954, CFI=.806, TLI=.736, NFI=.742 and RMSEA=.095. K-Drivers 65 plus and K-DBQ had a significant positive correlation(r=.470, p<.01) while there was a significant negative correlation with MoCA-K(r=-.495, p<.01). When we tested the usefulness of the K-Drivers 65 plus to assess driving suitability in senior drivers, the AUC (.726) was confirmed to have normal accuracy in selecting suitability. K-Driver 65 plus distinguished those with a total score of 31 or more as Risk drivers and those with scores of less than 31 as Safe drivers. Conclusion: Although K-Drivers 65 did not show high reliability and validity in this study, it was proven to be an adequate self-assessment tool for two reasons: 1) it can be easily provided to a large number of elderly drivers and 2) it is possible to prevent accidents by predicting driving suitability based on the results.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The first is abolished by the realization of philosophy. The second is abolished by the transformation of philosophy into the social theory. The third, philosophy is abolished when it survives as formal logic or dialectical logic. However, he criticizes these points of the view and makes his Marxism into humanistic Marxism by capturing the activities of the human subject in the philosophy of the practice. It defines the position of the human beings in the world and contributes to clarifying the moments of the practice in the human being as a meaning of the labour and the existence. Human beings are defined not by the totality pseudo-wholeness or fiction but by concrete totality. In order to grasp the true reality, we have to combine the concrete totality with the dialectics that pursue the things themselves. Furthermore, through the dialectical thinking, the human being can orient themselves toward an the open world through the practice, not only as the sum of the processes of the relations and facts, but also as the structures, occurrences, and totals.Eventually, such practice is established when the man is defined through the totality of the world revealed in the history.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Furthermore, the non-homogeneous stress field that develops inside the granular mass is characterized byfocused load transfer along columnar regions, higher stress anisotropy and lower horizontal-to-vertical stress ratio K0 than in agranular medium of homogenous stiffness. As the applied stress increases, the inherent stress-dependent response of the granularmaterial leads to a more homogenous stress field.

With the difference of the titles, the translations of the two shows a considerable problematic difference at the beginning part about the first verse. In suggesting the claims of outside-realist that ""the ālambana of cognition (e.g., a visual) is an external object"", Xuanzang described the five types of consciousness, while Paramārtha described the six types of consciousness. This difference is due to Paramārtha’s assumption that it is necessary to dispute all the six objects of cognition including mental consciousness, while Xuanzang assumed it enough to dispute the five objects of cognition.When we look at the translations of the commentary by Dharmapāla, while Yijing interpreted that it includes the fivefold assembly of consciousness in the Guan suoyuan lunshi (觀所緣論釋), Vinītadeva interpreted that it subsumes the mind (意), including eyes and ears and so on, in the Ālambanaparīkṣāṭīkā. There is some difference in interpretations between the line of ‘Xuanzang-Yijing’ explaining with the five kinds of consciousness and the line of ‘Paramārtha-Vinītadeva’ explainig with the six kinds of consciousness.Nevertheless, we can notice that the problem of the mind consciousness is not completely excluded from the interpretation of the former. The reason for omitting the mind consciousness was that it is not ‘consistent like one [一向]’ such as the previous five kinds of consciousness (前五識). For the mental consciousness perceived both the ultimate existence and conventional existence. Therefore, the meaning of the commentary that “the mental consciousness is not treated with a trouble”, should be interpreted to involve a kind of mental consciousness naturally, but it was too burdensome to discuss.And we can find that the position of Dignāga about the two conditions of cognition in the first verse has the purpose to refute the two conditions suggested by the Sautrāntika. The external object are not able to meet both conditions of cognition. Dignāga's intention only borrows their logic to point out that the two conditions are the cause of the wrong view. Rather than the two conditions correspond with the inside part of cognition, that is to say the grasped part, namely ālambana (所緣), Dignāga's original intention as a Yogācāra philosopher can be noticed from the point of refuting the two conditions. Therefore, we should not overlook the fact that his motive, which seems to accept the two conditions of cognition, was to borrow the logic intentionally in order to dispute the Sautrāntika.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Feedback Design for Multi-Antenna <tex> $K$</tex>-Tier Heterogeneous Downlink Cellular Networks,2018,,,"<P>We characterize the ergodic spectral efficiency of a non-cooperative and a cooperative type of <TEX>$K$</TEX>-tier heterogeneous network with limited feedback. In the non-cooperative case, a multi-antenna base station (BS) serves a single-antenna user using maximum-ratio transmission based on limited feedback. In the cooperative case, a BS coordination set is formed by using dynamic clustering across the tiers, wherein the intra-cluster interference is mitigated by using multi cell zero-forcing also based on limited feedback. Modeling the network based on stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions for the ergodic spectral efficiency as a function of the system parameters. Leveraging the obtained expressions, we formulate feedback partition problems and obtain solutions to improve the ergodic spectral efficiency. Simulations show the spectral efficiency improvement by using the obtained feedback partitions. Our major findings are as follows: 1) in the non-cooperative case, the feedback is only useful in a particular tier if the mean interference is small enough; 2) in the cooperative case, allocating more feedback to stronger intra-cluster BSs is efficient; and 3) in both cases, the obtained solutions do not change depending on the instantaneous signal-to-interference ratio.</P>",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

And the treatment duration was decided based on the PARK Formula (AIS). PARK Formula (AIS)=(AIS×2) ~ ([AIS×2]+2)Results: Among 39 patients included and 36 (92.3%) had treatment duration on casualty medical certificate within the range of treatment duration calculated by PARK Formula (AIS). Compared to the PARK Formula (AIS), the mean value was 0.13 week (0.90 day) smaller. Comparing the treatment duration between Korean Medical Association (KMA) guideline and PARK Formula (AIS), only 22 patients (56.4%) showed agreement. The mean value was 1.02 week (7.18 days) smaller in KMA guideline.Conclusions: For the decision of the treatment duration in trauma patients, utilizing worldwide used AIS scoring system is very efficient. Using PARK Formula (AIS), doctors can document the treatment duration in the casualty medical certificate with ease. KMA should provide more practical ‘treatment duration of each diagnosis in writing casualty medial certificate’ for the doctors.

Data are obtained from 793 Korean college students (214 from offline universities and 579 from online university). We describe the Standards’ approach for building a validity argument based on five sources of validity evidence: test content, response processes, internal structure, relations to other variables, and testing consequences. Results showed that the content of domains and items were appropriate to measure meaning in academic work, 2) a three-factor model with positive meaning in academic work, meaning making through academic work, and greater good motivation was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis, and 3) higher levels of meaning in academic work were related to higher levels of academic satisfaction, GPA, life satisfaction, and meaning in life. In addition, 4) all items discriminated a group with high academic meaning from another group with low academic meaning well and 5) all items did not have a bias effect in terms of gender. Therefore, the results of this study supported validity evidence that the final version of K-A-WAMI appropriately and properly measures the construct of meaning in academic work with responses from Korean college students.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Thus, complex data can be easily classified, but the amount of learning computation and memory increases due to increase of the number of weights. Deep learning, which requires a lot of computation and memory, usually is trained on cloud environments. However, the cloud environment must be maintained in good communication state with user and have burden on service cost and risk of leakage of personal information. To solve this problem, deep learning needs to be learnt on the embedded device, and be light-weighting. Pruning and quantization methods are widely used for the light-weighting. Existing quantization methods usually use K-means, one of the unsupervised learning methods, in order to determine representative values of clustering weights. In the K-means method, the number of groups is set through trial-and-error method, which results in the computation overhead. To alleviate the overhead, we propose an instant weight quantization method using statistical information of weights Also, it can improve learning performance by quantizing sequentially with considering the dependency between layers in the network.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

An onsite survey of visitors to Daebu Haesol 1 gil, Gyeonggi Province, was conducted from late November 2016 to early January 2017. An exploratory factor analysis and K-means cluster analysis were employed to identify market segments by using data collected from 434 respondents. The results showed three distinct segments labelled ‘Nature Seeking Responsible Tourists’, ‘Passive Nature Seeking Tourists’ and ‘Nature/Cohesion Seeking Responsible Tourists.’ All three segments had different levels of ‘escape’, ‘health’ and ‘cohesion’ motivations but commonly they all had a relatively high level of ‘nature’ motivation. As they also differed from each other in terms of sociodemographic and travel related characteristics as well as satisfaction level, it was concluded that motivation and attitudes of responsibility can be used for ecotourism market segmentation.

[l/ㄹ]이 지닌 [+continuantclassic] 자질이 후행 모음의 자질과 이화를 일으키면 [t/ㄷ]으로 변해 ‘彌里[*mʌj-li/ᄆᆡ리]’는 ‘彌知[*mʌj-ti/ᄆᆡ디]’로 변하게 된다. 그리하여 ‘蜜(密)地~彌知~彌里~彌離’ 등은 이음동의어 관계를 이룬다. 아울러 현대국어의 潮水名에서 ‘한매-한물, 두매-두물, 세매-세물’(도수희 2005: 176) 등과 같이 북방인 어청도에서는 ‘-매’이고, 남방인 흑산도에서는 ‘-물’인 점도 ‘買, 未, 米, 彌’와 ‘勿, 蜜(密)’의 고대 음가 및 관련성을 보여주는 실례가 된다. 馬邑縣 本百濟古馬彌知縣에서 ‘彌知’가 ‘邑’으로 개칭되었음을 알 수 있다. 즉, ‘邑 = 彌知~蜜(密)地~彌里~彌離~密’이 된다. ‘彌里 鄕之小者’(遼史 卷116)라 한 것을 보면, ‘枳慕蜜地’의 일반적인 의미는 ‘大邑, 雄邑’이 된다. 시대에 따라 聚落의 규모가 커지거나 작아져 의미가 확장되면 首都, 城, 村(일어 mura), 要塞 등의 의미도 가지게 되었을 것이다.‘枳慕蜜’과 속지명 ‘모질매’의 음운론적 관련성은 첫째, 어두 음절에서의 도치 현상을 들 수 있다. 왜냐하면 고지명 표기에서의 도치(臨津縣 本高句麗津臨城 景德王改名 今因之(三國史記 地理 二) 현상은 흔히 볼 수 있기 때문이다(도수희 1975: 61). 두 번째는 ‘-蜜(密)’과 ‘-매’의 음운론적 관련성이다. ‘-蜜(密)’의 고대 한자음은 [*mʌlj]([*ᄆᆞᆯ])~[*mʌj]([*ᄆᆡ])로 재구되며, 그 의미는 ‘邑’으로 추정되었다. 따라서 ‘枳慕+蜜/慕枳+蜜’의 구성을 이루어 ‘大+邑’의 의미를 갖는다. 세 번째는 k-구개음화와 관련된 것이다. 전설 고모음 앞의 연구개 파열음이 동일 환경의 경구개-치경 파찰음과 음향적으로 유사해서 청자들이 쉽게 혼동한다는 사실(Guion 1998)은 밝혀진 바 있다. 연구개음의 구개음화는 단일한 음 변화에 있어서 조음적 요인 및 음향적·인지적 요인이 모두 중요하다는 사실을 보여 준다(박종희‧권병로 2011). [ʧ]와 비슷한 스펙트럼 정점의 진동수를 가지는 전설 고모음 앞의 [k]는 인지적으로 [ʧ]와  ...","‘枳慕密地’ was the well known place name where the King Mu of Paek Je Dynasty had trnsferred the Capital from PuYeo. In this paper I would like to investigate the phonetic value of the several Chinese characters in the Old Korean relating with this place name. In general ‘枳(~只~支)’ represented the variants which had the phonetic value of [*ki~*kʌ~*ko] and 慕(~牟~馬) represented the variants which had the phonetic value of [*mo~*ma~*mʌ]. Therefore I would presume that ‘枳慕~支牟~只馬~古馬’ etc. had been used as a different transcriptions at the old times. Among these, ‘古馬彌知’ was correspondent with ‘馬邑’ in the place name reformed by the King Kyung Deok at the time of Unified Sylla Dynasty. In this case ‘馬’ represented the meaning of ‘big’ or ‘large’ which modified the following noun ‘邑’(town, city) and so ‘馬邑’ was intended to record for the meaning of a ‘big town’. According to this analysis I would like to interprete that ‘古馬彌知’ was used to represent ‘a big town/city’ or ‘a large community’.In the Chinese records ‘固麻’ was correspondent with Old Korean ‘古馬’ and then it referred to ‘格們’ in the Manchuria historical records. At the Keum Dynasty, ‘格們’ meaned to ‘a big town’. So I should ascertain that they all had the same meaning of ‘big’ or ‘large’.‘密’ could be reconstructured as the [*mʌlj/*mɨlj/*ᄆᆞᆯ/*믈] which was the same as the phonetic value of ‘彌, 未, 米’ etc. Because [*mʌlj/ᄆᆞᆯ] had experienced a vocalization to [*mʌj/ᄆᆡ] and then it became to [mæ/매] by the monothongization. Vowel harmony variants [*mɨlj/믈] was changed to [*mɨ] by [j] deletion or [*mi] by [ɨ] deletion. ‘地, 知, 遲, 至’ etc. could be also reconstructured as [*ti/디] which was historically changed to [ci/지] by the palatalization in Modern Korean. The feature [+continuantclassic] of the [l/ㄹ] would be dissimilated with the following vowel feature [+continuant] and then [l/ㄹ] should become to [t/ㄷ] having a feature [+continuant]. Therefore ‘密地~彌知~彌里~彌離’ etc. could be composed of synonyms. These variants like [mʌj~mɨj~mɨ~mʌ~mi] and [mæ] were respectively distributed according to their regional and social situation. For example the name of tides was divided into two group depending on the location of South and North. In the South ‘한물, 두물, 세물, …’ were widely used on the other hand ‘한매, 두매, 세매, …’ were used in the North. The different forms of ‘물’ and ‘매’ were used at present. The ‘물’ was originated from the ‘密’ and ‘勿’ which had the same phonetic value as that of ‘水/water’. On the other hand the ‘매’ was originated from ‘彌, 未, 米, 買’ which had the same phonetic value [*mʌj]. These synonymous ‘密地, 彌知, 彌里, 彌離’ etc. had the same meaning as a ‘邑, 城, 村, 首都, 聚落’.The frequency of a velar and a palatal-alveolar was more similar before a front vowels other than back vowels. Moreover in the casual speech style the frequency of a [k] and [c] was appeared more similar before a front high vowel other than non-front high vowels. The acoustic similarities of [k] and [c] would be showed up their perceptive similarity.

Each retelling reflects the values, beliefs, social fabric, and the ties of kinship, etc. according to its regions and dates.  In Sanskrit literature, one of the most representative poets of Rāma-Kathā after Vālmiki is Kālidāsa. Unlike Vālmiki’s traditional heritage, Kālidāsa, in his epic poem Raghuvanśam (literally means ‘lineage of Raghu’), narrates the kings of Raghu dynasty where Rāma belongs to. In this respect, Raghuvanśam has a unique status in the Rāma-Kathā tradition.  Kālidāsa himself mentions in the preface of the poem (sarga 1/ślokas 1-10) that he will recites the story of the kings of Raghu dynasty following Vālmiki’s traditional heritage, but differently from other narratives.  Kālidāsa enumerates the characteristics of Raghu dynasty at the beginning, and then illustrates how those characteristics are manifest in the kings’ life and reign in sarga 19. In this article, based on Raghuvanśam text, the story of the kings of Raghu dynasty has been analyzed from the perspective of Rājadharma (literally means ‘dharma of the rulers’). In Raghuvanśam, Rāma-Kathā is described from sarga 9 to sarga 15, and here, Rāma is identified as the 7th avatar of Lord Viṣṇu, and the features of Rāma-Kathā of Raghuvanśam show the influence of Rājadharma. On that basis, I have looked into the reflection of Kālidāsa ’ s times and society throughout Raghuvanśam; and through this, I tried to identify an indigenous status of the work in the Rāma-Kathā tradition.  To Sum up, Kālidāsa wrote Raghuvanśam with the object of presenting Rājadharma necessary for his times and society; Raghuvanśam is Rāma-Kathā with Raghu dynasty story written for showing Rājadharma in which rules of kings and Brāhmaṇas centered Hindu culture of the Gupta period is reflected.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Clustering Algorithm for Time Series with Similar Shapes,2018,"['Time Series', 'Clustering', 'Similar Shape', 'Modified K-Means']",,"Since time series clustering is performed without prior information, it is used for exploratory data analysis. In particular, clusters of time series with similar shapes can be used in various fields, such as business, medicine, finance, and communications. However, existing time series clustering algorithms have a problem in that time series with different shapes are included in the clusters. The reason for such a problem is that the existing algorithms do not consider the limitations on the size of the generated clusters, and use a dimension reduction method in which the information loss is large. In this paper, we propose a method to alleviate the disadvantages of existing methods and to find a better quality of cluster containing similarly shaped time series. In the data preprocessing step, we normalize the time series using z-transformation. Then, we use piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) to reduce the dimension of the time series. In the clustering step, we use density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to create a precluster. We then use a modified K-means algorithm to refine the preclusters containing differently shaped time series into subclusters containing only similarly shaped time series.

Regarding the Christian Reformation as a major cause of western modern civilization, he pursued the protection of nation and achievement of civilization through the reformation of Confucianism. At the level of nation-state, religion as the national principia was the root of politics. He believed that Confucianism, the main religion having the cultural legitimacy, would contribute to the construction of a unified nation state based on the moral maturity of people with Confucian education. In particular, He insisted that forest of Confucianists(K: yurim 儒林) should be people-oriented moral practical subjects devoting themselves to the nation state with the enthusiasm of saving the world.Second, Park Eun-sik, in the situation of Korea’s independence movement, emphasized the ethnicity of religion on which “the national spirit(K: gukhon 國魂)” had relied. From the viewpoint of the evolution of morality, he stressed the public virtues(K: gongdeok 公德) for the country and the people rather than the private virtues(K: sadeok 私德) only for oneself and one’s own family.Third, Park Eun-sik stressed the importance of communication with other religious cultures or thoughts as the source of religious creativity in an age of Great Unity(K: daedong 大同). He presented the Confucius’s teaching of Great Unity making the world shared publicly on the basis of humanity (K: In 仁) as the substance making all things one body. The bliss and pleasure of Great Peace (K: taepyeong 太平) in time of Great Unity, had the meaning of resistance and criticism against all inequalities and violence. BaekAm, in the position of moral cosmopolitanism, insisted on winning the national independence and freedom through pacifism and humanism against the Japanese Empire’s militarism.Fourth, Park Eun-sik, on the basis of study of mind-heart(K: simhak 心學), posited that the fundamental core study dealing with the mind-heart practice should preside the rational science. Especially he, classifying the Dohak(道學, the study of Tao) and the Sokhak(俗學, ordinary study) by the standard of moral substance as the Heaven’s mandate, reduced the Dohak as the problem of innate knowledge of the good(K: yangji 良知). And the inner sacred master as the moral substance was presented as the ontological foundation of all religions. The spiritual civilization based on philosophy should preside the material civilization based on rational science. He believed that philosophy and religion shared the common task of constructing moral community through the subjective awareness of moral substance and the practical actualization of it.In conclusion, Park Eun-sik, defining religion as the learning of morality leading to modern civilization, stressed the religion’s public morality at the level of nation-state, and presented the sacred inner master as the ontological foundation of all religions. In particular he imagined the complementary relation between philosophy and religion for the complete realization of morality. In this sense, it can be said that Park Eun-sik’s discourse on religion, based on the modern study of mind-heart, creatively converged Confucian tradition and Western modernity.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

First, he posited that humans could “communicate directly (K: jiktong 直通)” with the Lord on High as the transcendent sovereign through the mind-heart of spiritual intelligence. On the horizontal level, the human as a being of spiritual intelligence would have everyday encounters with other people with the ethical responsibility of fulfilling the good nature. Man, transcending all other creatures on the basis of spiritual intelligence, has the right to utilize them and the duty to care for their natural lives through political management policies. Jeong Yag-yong, criticizing the Joseon(朝鮮)’s Neo-Confucian theory on human mind-heart and nature based on Principle-Material force(K: IGi 理氣) metaphysics, constructed a new theory of human mind-heart and nature grounded on the concept of “spiritual body (K: yeongche 靈體)”, namely the original body of spiritual intelligence. His concept of spiritual body consisted of nature (K: seong 性) as ethical appetites (K: kiho 嗜好) for the good, balance (K: gwonhyeong 權衡) corresponding to the free will, and the actual practice (K: haengsa 行事). He classified all phenomenological modes of mind-heart into the way mind (K: dosim 道心) manifested from the ethical appetite for the good and the human mind (K: insim 人心) issued from bodily desires. Jeong Yag-yong especially stressed the existential conflict between the way mind and the human mind throughout the course of ethical practice; he came to the new spiritual awareness that the way mind is the Heaven’s mandate(K: dosimjeukcheonmyeong 道心卽天命).Jeong Yag-yong’s notion of the way mind as Heaven’s mandate carries distinctive features in its form, status, and content. First, Heaven’s mandate is conveyed every moment not through a natural phenomenon or the physical body but through the formless way mind. Second, the way mind, not only the manifestation of good nature but also the Heaven’s mandate, combines the immanent goodness of human nature in the Mencius (『孟子』)and the transcendent authority of Heaven’s mandate in the Mean (『中庸』). In this sense, it has attained the status of wondrous combination of Heaven and man (K: cheoninmyohap 天人妙合). Third, unlike the mystical quest for pure consciousness or the monotheistic worship of God as the Wholly Other, the way mind as Heaven’s mandate does not transgress human ethics. The heart of Jeong Yag-yong’s new spirituality lies in his sensitive religious consciousness accepting the ethical voice of the way mind as Heaven’s mandate.Jeong YagYong’s new Confucian spirituality based on human ethics as the way of relationships practiced by honoring virtuous nature (K: jondeokseong 尊德性) has the following characteristics. First of all, it shows the characteristics of humanly orientation(K: hyangin 嚮人) for ethical relationship rather than the characteristics of heavenly orientation(K: hyangcheon 嚮天) for the transcendent personal God or the characteristics of earthly orientation(K: hyangji 嚮地) for the cosmological unity of material world. Second, it aims at human ethics as the collaboration of Heaven and man(K: cheoninhapjak 天人合作) based on the fundamental condition of the human relation between two persons. In particular, benevolent responsibility (K: In 仁) as exhausting one’s duty in social relation and inferential reciprocity (K: chuseo 推恕) as the way...",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

On summit area Halema`uma`u lava lake continued to drop at high speed and Kīlauea’s summit continued to deflate. GPS receivers and electronic tiltmeters detected the surface deformation greater than 2 meters. We explored the time-series surface deformation at Kīlauea Volcano, focusing on the early stage of eruptive activity, using multi-temporal COSMO-SkyMed SAR imagery. The observed maximum deformation in line-of-sight (LOS) direction was about -1.5 meter, and it indicates approximately -1.9 meter in subsiding direction by applying incidence angle. The results showed that summit began to deflate just after the event started and most of deformation occurred between early May and the end of June. Moreover, we confirmed that summit’s deflation rarely happened since July 2018, which means volcanic activity entered a stable stage. The best-fit magma source model based on time-series surface deformation demonstrated that magma chambers were lying at depths between 2-3 km, and it showed a deepening trend in time. Along with the change of source depth, the center of each magma model moved toward the southwest according to the time. These results have a potential risk of including bias coming from single track observation. Therefore, to complement the initial results, we need to generate precise magma source model based on threedimensional measurements in further research.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Based on the study results, first was ‘the release of instinct to run’ as the meaning of their happiness from their free play in the winter forest. The children who left limited indoor place to go to the wider place ran without feeling the cold weather. Second, it was ‘play with imagination and creation.’ In the winter forest where there was a lack of playing things, they acknowledged the snow-covered forest as the new space and enjoyed the process to make their own imaginative play using the snow and nature. Third, it was ‘challenge, cooperation, and a sense of collaborative accomplishment.’ They showed scenes to take care each other’s safety when challenging their friends with difficult play situations. The fourth one was ‘calm space to think and search something.’ The children often sought their own space to think in the wide forest space and became silent because they were absorbed by their activities. The fifth one was ‘meeting with my friends and nature.’ They showed they experienced the different weather and changes in insects by seasons, and considered nature as a living friend, and accordingly, consider living creatures to be precious.

Also, the proper amount of target fund of deposit insurance for P&L insurance business seems to be lower than the current amount. This implies that the proper deposit insurance premium rate should be lower than the current rate of 0.15%. This study, using OPM (Option Pricing Model) to analyze deposit insurance premium rates, shows that the proper rate for the Korean P&L insurance business should be lower than 0.01%. In the near future, with the introduction of K-ICS (Korea Insurance Capital Standard), Korean insurers’ capital adequacy will be quite high and higher capital means lower default rate which should be a factor in lowering the deposit insurance premium rate.

"Estimating Ocean Tidal Constituents Using SAR Interferometric Time Series over the Sulzberger Ice Shelf, W. Antarctica",2018,,,"Ocean tides in Antarctica are not well constrained mostly due to the lack of tidal observations. Especially, tides underneath and around ice shelves are uncertain. InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data has been used to observe ice shelf movements primarily caused by ocean tides. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate tidal constituents underneath the Sulzberger ice shelf, West Antarctica, solely using ERS-1/2 tandem mission DInSAR (differential InSAR) observations. In addition, the tidal constituents can be estimated in a high-resolution (~200 m) grid which is beyond any tidal model resolution. We assume that InSAR observed ocean tidal heights can be derived after correcting the InSAR data for the effect of atmospheric loading using the inverse barometric effect, solid earth tides, and ocean tide loading. The ERS (European Remote Sensing) tandem orbit configuration of a 1-day separation between SAR data takes diminishes the sensitivity to major tidal constituents including K1 and S2. Here, the dominant tidal constituent O1 is estimated using 8 differential interferograms underneath the Sulzberger ice shelf. The resulting tidal constituent is compared with a contemporary regional tide model (CATS2008a) and a global tide model (TPXO7.1). The InSAR estimated tidal amplitude agrees well with both models with RMS (root-mean-square) differences of < 2.2 cm and the phase estimate corroborating both tide models to within 8˚. We conclude that fine spatial scale (~200 m) Antarctic ice shelf ocean tide determination is feasible for dominant constituents using C-band ERS-1/2 tandem mission InSAR.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

However, MMSE detection involves complicated matrix inversion, thus making it cumbersome to be implemented cost-effectively and rapidly. In this paper, we first summarize in detail the state-of-the-art simplified MMSE detection algorithms that circumvent the complicated matrix inversion and hence reduce the computation complexity from □(K<sup>3</sup>) to □(K<sup>2</sup>) or □(NK) with some certain performance sacrifice. Meanwhile, we divide the simplified algorithms into two categories, namely the matrix inversion approximation and the classical iterative linear equation solving methods, and make comparisons between them in terms of detection performance and computation complexity. In order to further optimize the detection performance of the existing detection algorithms, we propose more proper solutions to set the initial values and relaxation parameters, and present a new way of reconstructing the exact effective noise variance to accelerate the convergence speed. Analysis and simulation results verify that with the help of proper initial values and parameters, the simplified matrix inversion based detection algorithms can achieve detection performance quite close to that of the ideal matrix inversion based MMSE algorithm with only a small number of series expansions or iterations.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Based on the phenomenological approach regarding phonon MFP in a Si-PnC, simple fitting parameters were introduced to express the complex hole-phonon scattering mechanisms. By using previous experimental conditions and measured results, the fitting parameters were determined. The present model was applied to other existing measurement conditions for measuring K in Si-PnC, from which the justification for the method developed here was identified. Additional parametric values for conditions beyond those used in the developed hole-hole intervals were obtained, and we can confirm that the accuracy is higher than the accuracy of the numerical result obtained by the existing Monte Carlo technique.

Ihak 理學 C. lixue) as its ruling ideology. The learning of principle was also called the “learning of the Way”(K. Tohak 道學 C. daoxue). While the learning of principle is a value neutral concept used to explain all things by the principle, the learning of the Way is a concept that contains the logic of regarding other theories as heterodox teachings along with the strong sense of the lineage of the Way. The learning of the Way of Chosŏn has been mostly used as a term merely referring to meanings and principles focusing on practicality(義理實踐) of the Confucian scholars, including Kim Goeng-pil and Cho Kwang-jo. As the learning of the Way was introduced during the late Koryŏ period, however, the diverse usages of the term were found and moreover, its characteristics changed over a period of time.In the late 14th century the learning of the Way was used as a term indicating Cheng-Zhu learning from the Yuan dynasty or the learning of the principle itself. The learning of the Way focused on the way of study maintaining constant inquiry and study(道問學) and regulating the world(經世實踐). Especially the characteristics stood out as the logic of regarding Buddhism and Taoism as heterodox teachings. In the 15th century, the usage of the learning of the Way also based on classical studies and focused on the way of study maintaining constant inquiry and study(道問學) and regulating the world(經世實踐). The learning of the Way based on classical studies played a role as statecraft learning or ideology for rulers as well as literati. However, as hegemonic rulers like King Sejo or Prince Yŏnsan and corrupt political forces such as old meritorious elites emerged, it came to be difficult to rectify the society only with the learning of the Way valuing the classical studies based on the explication of the classics. Hence, from the late 15th century, the learning of the Way related to cultivate oneself(節義實踐) was advocated while the learning attitudes of honoring virtuous nature(尊德性), such as controlling the mind, nourishing inner nature, and abiding in reverence, were greatly encouraged. The learning of the Way was extended to the learning of the heart-mind (K. simhak 心學 C. xinxue), which was concerned with the cultivation of mind.Above all, the key point of the learning of the Way is carrying on the orthodox lineage of the Way. Among the scholars pursuing the learning of the principle in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn it was Yi Saek who was aware of the orthodox lineage of the Way. Yi Saek claimed the authenticity of the learning of principle from Yuan dynasty by putting Xu Heng on the rank of the orthodox lineage of the Way. The arguments on the orthodox lineage of the Way in the late Koryŏ and Early Chosŏn are divided into three categories: the argument on the shrine service to Chinese Confucian scholars, on the shrine service to Korean Confucian scholars, and on the Confucian scholars who were not served in the shrines. It is remarkable to note that opinions on the orthodox lineage of the Way were swayed by the social value of the time resulted in the incessant replacement of spirit tablets in the shrines.Arguments on the lineage of the Way in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn are characterized by the argument on the orthodox lineage of rulers and that of Confucian scholars. The argument on the orthodox lineage of rulers was an attempt to reestablish the royal lineage by the kings of Chosŏn, which was a state of the learning of the Way. This royal lineage was considered to have ceased since Emperor Wu of the Zhou dynasty. This was exposed in the idea proposed by Chŏng To-jŏn and Park ŭi-Jung. The argument on the orthodox lineage of Confucian scholars was the assertion that, after Confucius, the Way passed down to the Chinese literati was again transmitted to the Confucian scholars of Chosŏn. The argument is subdivided into the officially recognized form of shrine service and the form of the orthodox lineage of the Way approved by the Confucian scholars.The orthodox lineage from Yi Che-hyŏn through Yi Saek to Kwŏn Kŭn was mainly accepted by the literati up to the 15th century. All of them, however, were removed from the object of spirit tablets by reason of either inclination to Buddhism or lack of fidelity. In reality, in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn there were various arguments about the orthodox lineage based on transmission of scholarship. The first of them was the lineage of the Way from Xu Heng to Yi Saek. The second was the lineage from Yi Che-hyŏn through Yi Saek to Kwŏn Kŭn. The third was the lineage from Yi Saek through Chŏng To-jŏn to Kwŏn Kŭn. The fourth was the lineage from Kwŏn Kŭn, Kil Jae, Kim Suk-ja, and Kim Jong-jik to Kim Gwing-pil. Besides, Pak Yŏng suggested the lineage from Chŏng Mong-ju, Kil Jae, Kim Suk-ja, Kim Jong-jik, Kim Gwing-pil, and Chŏng Pung to Pak Yŏng as well as we can see the movement of putting Kim An-kuk on the spirit tables, before Yi Hwang says four sages. In conclusion, as for the argument on the orthodox lineage in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn, there were various lineages of the Way, regardless of the orthodox lineage made by rural Neo-Confucian literati after the middle of the 16th century.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The present research proposes a way to cultivate regularized cultural bridgebuilding in inter-Korean relations modelled after the 1958 inaugural International Tchaikovsky Competition.

Tuning the surface morphology and local atomic structure of Mn-TiO2 thin films using rapid thermal annealing,2018,,,"<P>In this study, Ti0.95Mn0.05O2-delta nanostructured thin films were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition technique followed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in pure O-2 and N-2 atmospheres. The RTA process induced a substantial change in the surfaces morphology and local atomic structure around Ti4+ cation that have been studied by means of atomic force microscopy, Raman scattering and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Raman spectra of the films were resembled to that of TiO2 rutile phase, and the change in the width of E-g (434 cm(-1)) Raman active modes has been attributed to oxygen non-stoichiometry. NEXAFS spectra were carried out in synchrotron facility at Ti/Mn L (3,2) edges and O-K edge. The ligand-field splitting, estimated from the energy difference between t(2g) and e(g) features in O K-edge spectra were similar to 2.81 eV for pristine and annealed film, which is a characteristic of the TiO2 rutile structure, and the asymmetry of t(2g) and e(g) bands at the O-K edge has been ascribed to oxygen vacancy (Vo(2+)). The annealing of film in O-2 gas optimized the surface structure and healed the Vo(2+) bridging, while the RTA in N-2 gas introduced Vo and reduced the valence state of Ti4+ (TiO2) into Ti3+ (Ti2O3) that have been probed by comparing the NEXAFS spectra of N-2 annealed film with the reference spectra of Ti2O3.

For this, science-related teachers’ accounts, activities in science classes, reflective journals, interview data, annual education plans, and activity plans excluding scientific activities were collected from 17 kindergarten teachers, who took early childhood science education class at graduate school of education of K university. As results, kindergarten teachers’ science teaching practices and characteristics of related teachers were as followings. First, superficial investigation - high/low preference of science. Second, investigation on teacher directed strategies - lack of knowledge about proper scientific concepts and teaching methods for young children. Third, experiment as a means - perception that science is special and negative sentiment. Fourth, lists of meaningless activities without investigative value - absent of focused scientific activity experiences and practical knowledge. Fifth, the continuous investigation considering children’s interest - expansion of knowledge through teacher’s repetitive self-reflection.

First Near-infrared Imaging Polarimetry of Young Stellar Objects in the Circinus Molecular Cloud,2018,,,"<P>We present the results of near-infrared (NIR) linear imaging polarimetry in the J, H, and K-s bands of the low-mass star cluster-forming region in the Circinus Molecular Cloud Complex. Using aperture polarimetry of point-like sources, positive detection of 314, 421, and 164 sources in the J, H, and Ks bands, respectively, was determined from among 749 sources whose photometric magnitudes were measured. For the source classification of the 133 point-like sources whose polarization could be measured in all 3 bands, a color-color diagram was used. While most of the NIR polarizations of point-like sources are well-aligned and can be explained by dichroic polarization produced by aligned interstellar dust grains in the cloud, 123 highly polarized sources have also been identified with some criteria. The projected direction on the sky of the magnetic field in the Cir-MMS region is indicated by the mean polarization position angles (70 degrees) of the point-like sources in the observed region, corresponding to approximately 1.6 x 1.6 pc(2). In addition, the magnetic field direction is compared with the outflow orientations associated with Infrared Astronomy Satellite sources, in which two sources were found to be aligned with each other and one source was not. We also show prominent polarization nebulosities over the Cir-MMS region for the first time. Our polarization data have revealed one clear infrared reflection nebula (IRN) and several candidate IRNe in the Cir-MMS field. In addition, the illuminating sources of the IRNe are identified with near-and mid-infrared sources.</P>",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Arrow)의 “불가능성 정리”(impossibility theorem)를 적용해보려고 시도하였다. 즉, 불가능성 정리를 이용하여 이 글에서는 개인들 간의 의견의 차이가 있을 경우에 입법절차의 결과를 지배한 의견이 입법의도라고 보는 것이 타당하지 않을 수 있음을 보여주고자 하였다.이를 위하여 먼저 제2장에서는 입법기관의 입법의도에 관한 종래의 논의를 살펴보고 구체적으로 어떤 점이 문제가 되는지 검토하였다. 제3장에서는 입법의도에 관한 논의를 전개하기 위하여 입법기관을 구성하는 개인이 가지고 있는 것으로 전제해야만 하는 선호의 합리성에 대하여 설명하였다. 이후에 제4장에서는 입법기관의 선택이 그 기관에 속한 개인들의 선호를 올바르게 반영한 것일 수 있기 위한 조건들을 살펴보았다. 그리고 제5장에서는 그러한 조건들을 만족하는 사회후생함수란 존재하지 않는다는 애로우의 불가능성 증명을 검토하였다. 끝으로 제6장에서는 이러한 애로우의 불가능성 증명이 역사적 해석과 관련하여 가지는 의미를 살펴보고자 하였다.","The historical interpretation has long been emphasized on “legislative intention” among other theories of legal interpretation. It might be because of the fact that law itself is the institution that gives a significance to a legislator’s authority. Nevertheless, the position putting emphasis on legislative intention in legal interpretation comes to meet with a problem as follows: What does the legislative intention concretely signify in an legislative body or an organization other than one individual? This study attempted to apply K. Arrow’s “Impossibility Theorem” as regards such a problem. In other words, this study tried to show that it could not be legitimate to regard an opinion, which governs the result of legislative proceedings, as legislative intention in case of the existence of a difference in views between individuals.To this end, this study looks into the existing discussion about legislative intention of the legislative body in Chapter 2, and examines which aspects become a problem in the concrete. In Chapter 3, this study gives an explanation about rationality of preference ,which must be premised as a being possessed by an individual who composes the legislative body, in order to develop a discussion about legislative intention. Afterwards, in Chapter 4, this study looks into the conditions for making it possible for a choice of the legislative body to properly reflect the preference of the individuals belonging to the agency. In addition, In Chapter 5, this study examines Arrow’s “Impossibility Theorem”, the argument that social welfare function which meets such conditions, doesn’t exist.

It is important to examine the labor of K-pop idols in that K-pop idol industry is at the center of the entertainment service industry, which consistently expands. In order to construct a theoretical lens, this study firstly considers the implication of the concept of ‘emotional labor’ advanced by Hochschild, focusing on how workers’ emotion is exploited by capital and how they experience alienated during their labor. This study also incorporates the implications of the notion, ‘affective labor’, advanced by Hardt and Negri. The concept affective labor implies that its mode triggers human interactions, exchanges, and relations. This means that human interactions and relations can be exploited by capital. Based on the implications of the two notions, this study finds that idol trainees in the audition show work along with the ethics of ‘competition’ and ‘solidarity’. The show emphasizes the ‘ethics of competition’ to the trainees in order to encourage them to improve their merit, as well as ‘the ethics of solidarity and mutual benefit’ as a means to promote their affective labor. Traditionally, the formation of a community based on solidarity and reciprocity was regarded as a solution to the problems of personalization and fragmentation that occur in overheated competition. In other words, solidarity has been understood as a cornerstone of anti-capitalist projects and the realization of democracy. However, it was found in the show that the ethics of solidarity and reciprocity were instrumentalized and capitalized in the entertainment service industry as work ethics.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Transport Velocity of Perilla Grain on Oscillating Sieve in Elliptical Motion,2018,"['Elliptical motion', 'Four-bar linkage', 'Throwing index', 'Screening', 'Thresher sieve']",,"Purpose: The objective of this study was to propose a formula for the theoretical grain mean transport velocities of an elliptically moving oscillator by modifying the grain mean transport velocity formula applied to linear motion and to compare the calculated values with the experimental values of grain mean transport velocity. Methods: The values of the throwing index (K<sub>v</sub>) and the maximum horizontal velocities for various positions on the elliptical oscillator were obtained using kinematic analysis. To obtain the actual grain transport velocity, the mean transport velocities of perilla grains at six positions on the sieve surface were measured using a high-speed camera and compared with the theoretical values. The cam with an eccentric bearing on the oscillator was designed to be eccentric by 1.6 cm so that the lengths of the major axis of the elliptical motion were 3.2-3.6 cm. The material used in the experiments was perilla grain. Results: The experimental result was consistent with the theoretical value calculated using the proposed formula (R<sup>2</sup> is 0.80). It is considered that the angle difference between the maximum accelerations in the directions vertical and horizontal to the sieve has as much influence on the grain mean transport velocity as the value of Kv itself. Conclusions: It was possible to theoretically obtain the grain mean transport velocities through a screening device in elliptical motion by modifying the formula of the grain mean transport velocities used in linear motion.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The process is as follows: Based on the preliminary spiritual practices of the Six-fold mind (ṣaṭ citta), Liberating Insight into dharmadhātu which is defined as the existence of non-existence is produced by the method of asllakṣaṇapraveśalakṣaṇa. The Six-fold mind is an intellectual method for spiritual practice, which examines the words and meanings of the teaching of sutra. The Six-fold mind could be said to be the internalization of the method of exegesis on the sutra. On the contrary, asallakṣaṇapraveśalakṣaṇa is a mystical method that removes the ordinary and mundane distinction between the grasped and the grasper, but gives rise to the direct and supra-mundane insight into dharmadhātu defined as the existence of non-existence. In the Avavādānuśāsanyadhikāra, asallakṣaṇapraveśalakṣaṇa is considered as the main method to produce Liberating Insight and the Six-fold mind is considered as a preliminary method for asllakṣaṇapraveśalakṣaṇa. In this regard, the Avavādānuśāsanyadhikāra appears to integrate the mystical method as the main position with an intellectual method as subordinate position.The Liberating Insight that is generated as a result of asallakṣaṇapraveśalakṣaṇa is basically defined as a non-discriminating cognition (nirvikalpajñāna) that lacks the grasped and the grasper as its object. It has the existence of non-existence, namely dharmadhātu, as its object. This non-discriminating cognition of dharmadhātu is a transcendental recognition that arises when the ordinary discriminating cognition disappears. At the same time it is also intellectual recognition, because it recognizes a sort of conceptual object, namely the existence of non-existence. Liberating Insight of Avavādānuśāsanyadhikāra is, on the one hand, a mystical recognition in terms of the disappearance of the mundane and dualistic mode of mind. On the other hand, it is a rational recognition in terms of the appearance of supra-mundane insight into the highly conceptual object defined as the existence of non-existence.In conclusion, Liberating Insight of Avavādānuśāsanyadhikāra could be regarded as a harmonious integration of a mystical tradition and a rational tradition.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The results of the study are as follows. First, the motivation for married women to participate in the study was to start from the desire to find oneself that was lost. Second, I overcome the loss of self - esteem through the process of participating in the program and recovered my confidence that I can do it. Third, the conclusion after the participation was to try new challenge to become an elderly play therapy expert through learning, and to have a heart to look around the difficult neighbors through practice of talent donation. Based on the results of this study, this study is meaningful in suggesting the necessity of research on lifelong learning program for expanding learning participation program for re-employment of later-career disabled women and capacity development of married women with career disconnection.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
무고죄의 보호법익과 각칙상 지위에 대한 비판적 고찰 -유기천 교수의 국가적 법익설을 단서로 삼아-,2018,"['calumny', 'obstruction of justice by deception', 'false report', 'judgmental function', 'individual’s legal safety', '무고죄', '위계공무집행방해죄', '허위신고', '국가의 심판기능', '개인의 법적 안전']","무고죄의 보호법익은 이원적으로 파악되어 왔다. 국가의 적정한 사법판단기능이라는 국가적 법익을 주된 보호법익으로 보면서, 피무고자의 법적 안전과 같은 개인적 법익도 부수적⋅부차적으로 보호한다는 내용의 절충설이 50년 넘게 통설이자 판례로 받아들여지고 있다. 하지만 절충설의 내용이 두 법익 중 하나만 침해⋅위태화되면 본 죄의 성립을 인정하겠다는 것인지 아니면 두 법익 모두 침해⋅위태화 되어야 한다는 의미인지 그 실체가 명확하게 밝혀진 것은 아니다. 절충설에 따르면 피무고자가 승낙하거나 자기무고를 교사한 경우에도 이견 없이 본 죄의 성립을 인정하고 있다. 또한 무고죄의 입법취지와 구성요건상 외국관청에 처벌목적의 허위신고를 한 내국인을 처벌할 수 없다. 국가의 심판기능을 보호함에 따라 간접적으로 개인에게 부당한 형사처분이나 징계처분을 받지 않도록 하는 무고죄의 구조 역시 국가적 법익에 관한 범죄목록에 편재된 여타 범죄들과 다르지 않다. 결국 절충설은 국가적 법익에 의해 무고죄의 성립을 판단하는 견해로 보아야 한다.무고죄의 보호법익이 무엇인지에 대해서 국가적 법익으로만 파악하는 입장도 개진되어 있다. 그동안 두 학설은 보호법익을 어떻게 파악하느냐에 따라 무고죄의 죄수판단이 서로 다른 것으로 설명되어 왔다. 그러나 무고죄의 죄수판단이 보호법익에 의해서만 결정될 수 없다는 점에서 죄수론의 일반적 판단기준에 의할 때 두 학설의 결론은 차이를 보이지 않는다. 판례 역시 개인적 법익까지 보호법익으로 포함하는 입장이라고 이해되어 왔지만, 자기무고의 교사⋅방조나 승낙무고 사례에서 개인의 법적 안전은 국가의 심판기능과 별도로 판단되어지는 게 아닌, ‘부수적’인 것에 불과하다고 밝혀놓았다. 더 나아가 국가의 형사처분 또는 징계처분의 적정한 행사를 방해하지는 않았지만 피무고자의 법적 안전이 침해될 위험이 발생한 사안에서 무고죄의 성립을 인정하지 않았다. 결국 절충설은 물론이고 그와 같은 견해로 이해되어 온 판례도 실제로는 국가의 적정한 심판기능만을 보호법익으로 삼고 있는 것이다.무고죄의 보호법익에 개인적 법익이 포함되었다고 믿어왔기 때문에, 그동안 의심 없이 당연하게 받아들여져 왔던 부분이 있다. 위증죄 등 국가의 심판기능을 보호하기 위한 범죄 중 가장 높은 법정형, 위계에 의한 공무집행방해죄와의 중복적 적용 및 범죄성립요건의 전도된 해석, 그리고 몇 개 특별법에 국한하여 별도의 무고죄를 두고 가중처벌해 왔던 입법태도가 여기에 해당한다. 개인적 법익의 보호라는 통념은 무거운 처벌만을 용이하게 하였을 뿐 정작 피무고자의 보호를 소외시키는 방향으로 작용해 왔다. 따라서 차제에 무고죄의 보호법익을 정확하게 자리매김하면서 무고로 인해 직접적으로 명예나 자유 등의 피해를 입거나 당할 수 있는 개인을 보호하기 위한 입법적인 개선방안을 마련해야 한다.","The benefit and protection of the law of calumny has been understood dualistically. An eclecticism that considers national benefit and protection of the law which is a country’s proper function of judicature judgment as a major benefit and protection of the law and incidentally and indirectly protects personal benefit and protect of the law such as legal safety of the falsely accused has been accepted as a conventional wisdom and a precedent for over 50 years. Such a eclecticism seems to import a Germany’s theory through Japan’s calumny. Korea’s calumny differs from Germany and Japan’s legal penalties. Other countries’ legal penalties on calumny are higher than on perjury protecting a country’s judgmental function. However, Korea’s upper limit of legal penalties on perjury or destruction of evidence are two times higher. Thus, to establish the benefit and protection of the law of Korea’s calumny, its content needs to be different from the eclecticism of Germany and Japan protecting either national benefit and protection of the law or personal benefit and protection of the law selectively.There is no disagreement in establishment of calumny on the grounds of approvals by the falsely accused or abetting false accusation against oneself in the eclecticism and precedents in Korea. It means that calumny is established without a violation of personal benefit and protection of the law. On the contrary, can individuals’ legal safety be in danger while there is no violation of national benefit and protection of the law? It cannot take place according to Korean legal provisions related to calumny. Thus, the substance of Korea’s eclecticism should be considered as a theory to judge the establishment of calumny on the basis of national benefit and protection of the law. The falsely accused which a criterion that has been put up when judging the number of crimes of calumny by eclecticism is not accurate. That is because it does not judge the number of crimes based on benefit and protection of the law and there is no reason to put up secondary benefit and protection of the law as a standard of judgement. Therefore, the judgment on the number of crimes of calumny by eclecticism and the judgement by national benefit and protection of the law lead to the same conclusion according to the general theory of the theories of the number of crimes.Calumny is not to protect a country’s judgmental function itself but people who could be in danger if such a function does not work properly. That relationship between national benefit and protection of the law and personal benefit and protection of the law is common to every crime classified as criminal offenses related to national benefit and protection of the law in the present penal code.  Therefore, it is appropriate that the benefit and protection of  the law of calumny  is also understood as national benefit and protection of the law. However, if calumny is understood as national benefit and protection of the law, its relation with obstruction of justice by deception becomes problematic. Such a problem has not been discussed due to a common notion which understands the two crimes’ benefit and protection of the laws differently, and they become crimes protecting the same benefit and protection of the law. The judiciary has recognized the responsibility to uncover truths of investigative agencies in only obstruction of justice by deception, not in calumny. Because of this, a phenomenon of distortion that calumny of which legal penalty is much higher is constituted easier has been tolerated. Apart from criminal law, there is a　number of special laws which have separate calumny according to crimes regarded as calumny and they are contradictory to the basic principle of law of calumny, so they need to be deleted.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

I focused on the concepts of the true body (眞身, saṃbhoga-kāya) and the avatar (化身, nirmāṇa-kāya) of the Kwaneum Bodhisattva (觀音菩薩, Avalokiteśvara) which are identified in the story of Euisang (義相) and Wonhyo in 「Naksan-edaesoung Kwaneum Joungchuy Choshin」. The narrative of Euisang discusses the experience of the true body (saṃbhoga-kāya) of Kwaneum based on 『Hwaeomkyeong (華嚴經)』.In Wonhyo’s story however, the incarnation (avatar, nirmāṇa-kāya) of Kwaneum happened to be an ordinary person who lived in Shilla (新羅). This demonstrated that familiar and vulgar beings encountered on this country could be regarded as incarnations of Kwaneum.Wonhyo’s story is one of the articles collected under the heading 「Naksan-edaesoung Kwaneum Joungchuy Choshin」 which is centered on the Kwaneum Bodhisattva who was believed to have lived in Naksan (洛山). This reveals that the avatar of Kwaneum, who appeared as the Shilla citizen Wonhyo saw on the way to Naksan, was a manifestation of Kwaneum residing in Naksan. In this story, Wonhyo was employed as a mediator for, and witness of, an indigenized avatar of Kwaneum. It was attributed to his role as the forerunner of Buddhist teachings for the general public in Shilla society.The 「Bomunpum (普門品)」 of 『Beophwakyeong (法華經)』 which had been circulated in Shilla society before the introduction of Huayan thought (華嚴思 想) by Euisang became the basis of Wonhyo’s faith in Kwaneum. This is a representative scripture that emphasizes the avatar of Kwanuem as a means (方 便, upāya) of salvation for people. From this perspective, the article 「Naksanedaesoung Kwaneum Joungchuy Choshin」 combines Euisang and Wonhyo’s practical orientation toward the faith of Kwaneum. It also shows the way in which Kwanuem beliefs became indigenous to Shilla society.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Sometimes initial <sup>*</sup>ʔ was used to express <sup>*</sup>k- and the medial -r- was used to express the liquids ending -r by metathesis in translation of Old Korean. So the Chinese character 音汁[<sup>*</sup>ʔrimʨip] could be used for expressing [<sup>*</sup>kirmʨip] in ancient Korea.

For this, a survey on the perception of learning ethics was conducted targeting total 112 freshmen including 54 liberal arts students and 58 science & engineering students of K university in Seoul, taking the writing course opened for freshmen. The composition of the questionnaire was largely divided into two parts such as items related to general academic performance and items related to completion of assignments, and for the responses to the survey questions, the 5-point Likert Scale was used.. In the results of this study, the mean value of ethics related to general academic performance was 4.0 or up, which was relatively high. However, the items related to assignment were lower than the mean, which showed the low level of perception of learning ethics. Meanwhile, regarding the differences in the perception of ethics in accordance with sex and affiliation, overall, the male students and the freshmen in science & engineering showed the lower perception of learning ethics than female students and freshmen in liberal arts. The items of ethics related to the completion of assignments showing the low mean values included ‘double submission of assignments, transfer of assignments, joint marking of non-participants in assignments, partial marking of sources, plagiarism of development structure/methods of the original text, and the act of changing into his/her own words without marking the source of the original .

場所の助詞「に」と「で」の誤用の原因の分析,2018,"['日本語の助詞「に」と「で」', '場所', '使い分け', '誤用', '韓?人日本語?習者', 'Japanese particles “ni” and “de”', 'location', 'usage', 'usage errors', 'Korean Japanese learner']",,"Among the particles used in two countries with similar morphology, Japanese particles “に(ni)” and “で(de)” and Korean particles “에(e)“ and”에서(eseo)“ have a common meaning to express location. Particles ""ni"" and ""e"" are used to indicate ”place of existence“ and ""de"" and ""eseo"" are used to indicate ""place where behavior and action occur."" A Korean Japanese learner corresponds the particles one to one without difficulty. In doing so, a problem may arise as the correct answer rate surpasses 90%.  Therefore, regarding the selection of particles “ni” and “de,” Lee (2017)(2018)’s study shows that Korean Japanese language learners (major, non-major) in the initial learning stage have tendencies to use fixed phrases ""position+ni"" and ""place name+de."" In addition, Lee (2017)(2018) backed up the tendency of selection of such particles in precedent study, and clearly supports the results of the usage errors of particles ""ni"" and ""de"" to represent place in relation to the influence of learning and of one’s mother tongue through an experiment conducted on November 2013. (Examinees: majors in Busan P. University (73 students), non-majors in Busan K. University (73 students))  Although the method of experiment follows a similar pattern to previous studies of Lee (2017)(2018), this study analyzes the survey conducted on November 2013 and reclassifies the questionnaire based on learning level and not the period of learning. More than 95% of non-major students were excluded form the survey as they do not have a qualified language certificate.  The following results were obtained based on the comparison and contrast of location particles “ni” and “de” used by major students of different level. The causes of usage errors can be largely divided into four. ① Difference in level: the accuracy rate of semi-advanced level (N2) learners is slightly higher than advanced level (N1) learners. ② Influence of learning: A: excessive use of ""ni"" compared to “de” and over-generalization of the fixed phrases ""position+ni"" and “place name+de.“ (Su et al. (2006)) B: A unit of noun+particle formation is created when selecting particles ""ni"" and ""de."" (Noda et al. (2001), Sakuda (2001)) ③ Frequency of learning materials: ”Mae(前)“ and ”naka(中)“ used to represent location comes up fewer times than ”ni“ and ”de“ in ”Minnano Nihongo 1,2.“ ④ Influence of mother tongue: Korean Japanese learners are influenced greatly by the mother tongue in expressions ”to live (~sumu)“ and ”to stay (~tomaru).“ Especially the results that the accuracy rate of beginning level students are ranked slightly higher than semi-advanced to advanced level students in the case of ""tomaru"" shows discrepancies with the study done by Ozeki (2007).",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

G.Wells’ The War of the Worlds to the Japanese translation, Kasejin to no Sensō (War with the Martians, 1941). In The War of the Worlds, we can read the ambivalence in Wells’ critique of imperialism and colonialism. The text encourages patriotic anxiety by imagining Britain invaded by Martians. It advocates that the Martians are driven by an incessant struggle for existence and cannot help invading the earth. It thus criticizes western imperialism and colonialism by comparing the relationship between the Martians and Earthlings to that of the animals and indigenous people, whose civilizations have gone extinct. However, the Japanese translation weakens this ambivalence and turns it into a text promoting imperialist aggression. The death of the Martians in The War of the Worlds means a defeat to the history of the struggle for survival on Earth. Thus, the death of the Martians is inevitable.The deletion of this evolutionary context in Kaseijin to no Sensō turns the Martians’ death into a coincidence with the help of allies, not something inevitable. As the death of the Martians changes from inevitable to accidental the patriotic anxiety of the original text is further emphasized and the message of the imperialist criticism of the original text weakened.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Therefore, this paper studies the subject of earnings transparency.This study examines the effect of earnings transparency on the firm value and also the differences of the impact by corporate governance characteristics. In this study, earnings transparency is proxied by measures developed by Cheng and Subramanyam(2008) and firm value proxied by Tobin s Q. The sample consists of firm-year which has December fiscal year-end and listed on the securities market over 2011-2017.Empirical results are as follows. First, earnings transparency is significantly and positively associated with the firm value. This means that higher the earnings transparency is, the greater the firm value is. Second, this study finds that the firm value increased on the earnings transparency when firms with business group affiliation, outside director system and board size, foreign ownership ratio are high. Non-significant results are observed when the largest shareholder ownership ratio are low. This results support some arguments that earnings transparency can be used as one of the explanatory variables for accounting transparency. Our research findings will facilitate the management of earnings transparency in domestic enterprises and contribute to the practical assessment of the company s intrinsic value.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
수축부 길이 변화에 따른 풍동 내부유동장 특성에 대한 수치해석,2018,"['Boundary Layer Thickness', 'Contraction', 'Numerical Analysis', 'Subsonic Wind Tunnel']",,"The steady-state, incompressible and three-dimensional numerical analysis was carried out to investigate the internal flow field characteristics of wind tunnel according to the change of contraction length. This study used a realizable k-ε turbulence model. As a result, regardless of the contraction lengths, the minimum value of the axial mean velocity component at the entrance of the plenum chamber is increased through the contraction and has the maximum value in the test section. When the flow passes through the inner space of the analytical models, the average pressure and axial force due to the surface pressure acting at the inlet of the plenum chamber is the smallest at the contraction length of 1,000 mm, but the axial force due to the surface stress increases as the contraction length increases. The maximum turbulent kinetic energy in the test section decreases as the contraction length increases. Comprehensively, it can be concluded that the contraction length of 1,000 mm at the contraction area ratio of 9:1 is the best choice for wind tunnel selection with superior performance.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Sipjipum 十地品), in the Collection of Annotations of Avatamsaka Sutra (K. Hwaeomsocho 華嚴疏鈔) in order to highlight the unique features and differences of their understandings of Buddhism. Earlier studies, such as an account by a Buddhist monk from the modern period, Park Han-young, have revealed that Yeondam and Inak had a distant relationship, in regard of the periodical surroundings of their times and their different views on Buddhism. But this study tries to suggest definite evidences of an academic interchange between them by examining their annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra. Shown below is the three evidence of the contention. Firstly, only from Yeondam’s collection of annotations, Yumanggi (Ch. 遺忘記), explanatory diagrams (K. Gwado 科圖) are found. Secondly, the comments on the annotations of the Avatamsaka Sutra made by Seolpa, Yeondam, and Inak all have traces of amendments. Thirdly, the collections of annotations of Yeondam and Inak have dealt with the same issue but they explained it in a different manner. On the basis of these three evidences, it is possible to assume that they each made annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra in different times and manners. Given the fact that the annotations from latter date added new explanations to its preceding writings, it is reasonable to understand that there were academic interchanges between the three monks. As a result of examinations on Yeondam and Inak’s annotations, the former seems to have pursued deeper understandings on the meaning of the Avatamsaka Sutra while the latter have aimed to conduct meticulous examinations. This study also tried to elucidate the difference of Yeondam and Inak’s understandings on the meaning of the Avatamsaka Sutra. As an example, about the meaning of a phrase “都無所得”, which is read as “there is nothing to gain”, from the Collection of Annotations of Avatamsaka Sutra, Yeondam tried to interpret those words from the perspective of Yogacara Thought, while Inak tried to read them in the relation with the Avatamsaka Study. Yeondam’s approach to deal with the issue on the basis of the phenomenal world and Inak’s approach to explain it from the view of fundamental world suggest their different Buddhist perception. This study examines only a small part of the two monks’ annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra in order to highlight the differences in their thought. It is anticipated that more detailed analysis on the rest of their writings will reveal further distinctive features of their ideas on Buddhism.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The children performed the Wechsler Intelligence (IQ) Scale, Stroop interference test (Stroop), word fluency test (WF), and design fluency test (DF) to assess their neurocognitive development.Results ‘Nurturing of Development’ and ‘Variety of Language Interaction’ scores from the K-HOME-Q, were inversely associated with total behavior problems, externalization, rule-breaking, and aggressive behavior subscales of K-CBCL, and ‘Emotional atmosphere’and ‘Tolerance toward the child’ scores showed inverse associations with the total behavior problems, rule-breaking, aggressive behavior, and withdrawn/depressed subscales. Despite economic hardship, the mean scores of the neurocognitive tests were comparable to the average level of Korean children’s normative sample. However, ‘Nurturing of Development’ and ‘Tolerance toward the Child’ score of KHOME-Q were associated with better executive function (IQ, WF, DF).Conclusion These results suggest that parental stimulation of development and tolerant parenting attitude may offer protection against the negative effects of suboptimal economic environment on children’s behavior and neurocognitive development.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Especially, in the case of Active Experimentation(AE), this tendency became more prominent as the school year goes up, Second, from Learning Styles of Kolb, it was in the order of Assimilator, Diverger, Accommodator, and Convergent.Third, from anticipated and final letter grades that are considered to be representative tools for measuring academic achievement, the higher the expected letter grades, the more likely students are to receive higher letter grades. In addition, they receive higher grades than their expected grades.Lastly, as anticipated grades of Assimilator students increase, final letter grades of their major study tended to increase. However, the students from the rest of Learning Styles did not predict their final letter grades. This means that Assimilator students are likely to predict the degree of learning performance based on their anticipated grades .This study identifies the distinctive Learning Styles among students’ majoring in Photography & Motion.

All cases were successfully implanted via round window approach. Preoperative puretone audiometry and speech perception score [phonetically balanced (PB) words, bi-syllablewords, Korean version-central institute for the deaf (K-CID)], intraoperative evoked compoundaction potential (ECAP), postoperative audiometry, aided warble-tone thresholds and speechperception scores after 6 months were evaluated. Residual hearing group was defined as patientswith below 40 dB of average audiometric threshold in low frequency (250 and 500 Hz).Preservation of residual hearing and postoperative complication were also evaluated.Results The mean age of five patients (3 men, 2 women) was 37.6 years. All of the recipientswere unsatisfied about the conventional hearing aid. Two patients met the criteria for belongingto a residual hearing group. The audiometric threshold on the implanted side was 102.8dB, and the opposite side was 89.6 dB. The speech perception score with hearing aid resultedin the PB word score of 35.5%, bi-syllable word score of 50%, and the open set sentence testof 62.5% on the average. The mean operation time was 87 minutes. Three patients showednormal ECAP response throughout the entire electrode intraoperatively, but the other two patientscould not detect ECAP response intraoperatively. However, we could eventually identifyECAP responses in all cases postoperatively. All patients of residual hearing group could preservetheir residual hearing without deteriorating more than 10 dB on audiometry. At 6months after implantation, there was significant improvement of speech perception scores (PBword score was 54.1%; bi-syllable word score was 68.1% and K-CID was 86.2%).Conclusion Neuro OneⓇ cochlear implant system was able to preserve residual hearing withrelative short operation time. Short-term clinical outcome showed no significant differencewith other cochlear implant devices. However, intraoperative ECAP measurement was notconsistent. Further investigation was necessary.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common neuropathic disease in the upper extremities. The aim of this study was to verify the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of Korean version of QuickDASH questionnaire (K-QuickDASH) in the patients with CTS.Methods: In total, 83 subjects who underwent open carpal tunnel release (CTR) operation were selected. They fulfilled Korean version of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (K-DASH) and K-QuickDASH at two different time points: before and six months after the surgery. Both criterion-related and construct validities were evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient and factor analysis. Internal consistency was estimated using Cronbach's alpha, and test-retest reliability was assessed to verify the reliability of K-QuickDASH using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The standardized response mean and the effect size were analyzed to confirm the responsiveness of the K-QuickDASH in CTS patients.Results: Significant positive correlation was found between K-QuickDASH and K-DASH. All the questionnaire items were categorized into three factors. Acceptable internal consistency was confirmed in three categories of K-QuickDASH. A high test-retest reliability and responsiveness of K-QuickDASH were detected.Conclusion: K-QuickDASH in Korean patients with CTS was confirmed to have high degree of validity and reliability, and responsiveness after CTR. Therefore, the K-QuickDASH would be a good evaluation tool for evaluating clinical symptoms and determination of treatment outcomes in the patients with CTS.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

To address the lack of information about the brown Korean irises, we classified the colors and patterns of the irises of 100 Korean eyes.Methods: The iris colors were extracted from 100 different digital photographs of each eye using K-mean clustering image analysis. The RGB data of the extracted colors were converted to CIELAB color space data and analyzed to determine the representative color of the iris in each photograph. The color differences were calculated to form groups of similar colors by matching the 100 samples into several groups with minimum color differences among them. The average hue value for each group was calculated, and the corresponding representative color was selected from 2 to 3 colors in one group. Results: The iris colors were classified into seven brown color groups with 2 to 3 colors in each group. The coloration of Koreans’ eyes appears to vary in a similar hue with differences in chroma and lightness. In addition, the iris patterns were classified into three basic patterns, namely, crown, sunshine, and flower, as well as three complex patterns that are mixtures of two basic patterns.Conclusions: We classified Korean iris colors and patterns for application in the design of artificial eyes.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Methods: Parental questionnaires of 187 children aged 3–6 years were analyzed. The metrics included smart device usage frequency (times/week, scored as uFreq), smart device usage time (hours/day, scored as uTime), parental scale for appropriate smart device usage level (scored as uLevel), the Korean-developmental screening test (K-DST), and the scale for self-regulation ability in young children (scored as SRS, and including four sub-categories: self-appraisal, self-determination, behavior inhibition, and emotionality). The correlations were analyzed by total age group and by each age. Results: In the total age group analysis, uFreq and uTime were negatively correlated with mean SRS (rs= -0.366, -0.330; P<0.001) and sub-category SRS (rs= -0.186 to -0.370; P<0.05). Mean uLevel score was positively correlated with mean SRS (rs=0.406; P<0.001) and most of the mean sub-category SRS (rs=0.174 to 0.362; P<0.05). In 3-year-old children, the mean SRS was strongly negatively correlated with uFreq (rs=-0.751; P<0.001), negatively correlated with uTime (rs=-0.518; P<0.001), and positively correlated with mean uLevel score (rs= 0.533; P=0.013). Such correlations seemed to decrease at the age of 4–6 years. Conclusion: Self-regulation ability was significantly correlated with smart device-related factors and was the highest in the 3-year-old children. Encouraging appropriate smart device usage will be helpful for self-regulation development of young children.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The surrounding natural and anthropogenic sources at each site were different; Shirasaka is in a rural area and Tanashi is an urban environment. The volume weighted (vw) mean concentrations of K+ and Ca2+ in the bulk samples were significantly (p<0.05) higher than those in the wet-only samples at both sites. The forest canopy and a nearby incineration plant were hypothesized to be the main sources of K+ contaminants at Shirasaka and Tanashi, respectively. The transport of sea salt and urban dust may explain the presence of enriched Ca2+ concentrations in the bulk samples at Shirasaka and Tanashi, respectively. The NH4 + concentrations in the Shirasaka bulk samples were significantly (p<0.05) lower than those in the wet-only samples. The vw mean SO4 2- and NO3 - concentrations in both sample types were not significantly different at either site. This study demonstrated that the ion concentration differences between wet-only and bulk samples were affected by nearby natural and anthropogenic sources even at forest sites, similar to previous findings for non-forested locations. However, the K+ concentration differences between wet-only and bulk samples may be higher owing to forest sources, even in the absence of anthropogenic sources.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Myeongneung (明陵) was one of the most important royal tombs during late Joseon Dynasty, and is the burial place for King Sukjong (肅宗, 19th King of the Joseon Dynasty) and his 2 wives Empress Yinhyeon and Yinweon. King Sukjong’s two sons, Gyeongjong ( 20th King of the Joseon Dynasty) and Yeongjo (英祖, 21st King of the Joseon Dynasty) ruled after their father Sukjong, and were subsequently followed by Sukjong’s great grandson, King Jeongjo (正祖 22nd King of the Joseon Dynasty), who led the renaissance during the late Joseon dynasty. Myeongneung is not far from Seoul, which enabled easy visits by Sukjong’s descendants. The Academy of Korean studies has investigated the late Joseon Dynasty’s Neungguan system (陵官制度) in great depth through studying The Myeongneung Seonsaengan (明陵先生案, K2-524) and Myeongneung Chambong Seonsaengan ( 明陵參奉先生案, K2-4989), both which are owned by Jangseogak.  The royal mausoleum contains the ancestor king’s tombs and represented the service king’s filial devotion. In addition, the Neungguan’s role afforded him an opportunity to move up within the government bureaucracy, whether a new member of the bureaucracy or an existing member looking to take on a new position. The Neungguan’s role was not overly burdensome, and opened up opportunities to connect with influential people.It was also possible to quickly get promoted to the level of local government official.  Futhermore, the Neungguan position was a means to reduce officer promotion backlog in the late Joseon dynasty bureaucracy given Neungguan openings were regularly available in comparison to other roles within the limited bureaucracy system. To allay hiring and promotion issues within the late Joseon dynasty, the governing body created a hierarchy system within the Neungguan position itself, allowing for the promotion of individual’s within the role to a higher status Neunguan.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

It could also be used to look at heterogeneity at specific levels of the variable of interest among groups. We use the clustering by the k-means and Dirichlet process to discretize the continuous variable. When we discretize the continuous variable, it can be treated as an analysis of the contingency table. Then the chi-squared test is the most common thought.

The Korean version of the NMS scale (K-NMSS) was used for evaluation of NMSs in patients. The patients were divided into high NMS and low NMS groups. The region-of-interest analyses were performed in the following deep nuclei: red nucleus, substantia nigra pars compacta, substantia nigra pars reticulata, dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, and head of the caudate nucleus.Results: Thirteen patients had high NMS scores (total K-NMSS score, mean = 32.1), and 16 had low NMS scores (10.6). The QSM values in the deep were not different among the patients with high NMS scores, low NMS scores, and controls. The QSM values were not correlated linearly with K-NMSS total score after adjusting the age at acquisition of brain MRI.Conclusion: The study demonstrated that the NMS burdens are not associated with iron accumulation in the deep nuclei of patients with PD.

The outcome was measured using a visual analogue scale in leg (L-VAS), back (B-VAS) each other ranging from one to 10 and Korean version oswestry disability index (k-ODI) at before procedure, 4 weeks and 2 month visit after procedure. The authors categorized enrolled patients into acupuncture group (AG) and ESI group (EG) each other. Relative ratio Between ROI of peri-discal peak enhancement and peak renal enhancement ratio was measured and analyzed.Results: In EG, the mean pre-procedural B-VAS score was 6.43 and in AG the mean B-VAS was 5.9. L-VAS was 5.95 and k-ODI was 16.3 in EG. L-VAS was 3.1 and k-ODI was 15.5 in AG. A month after procedure, B-VAS, L-VAS and k-ODI were 4.7, 4.3 and 11.9 in EG and 4.8, 2.1 and 11.2 in AG. There was the significant improvement in B- (p<0.001) and L-VAS (p<0.001) a month after ESI. But there was not significant improvement in B- and L-VAS a month after acupuncture. In EG, the more change was observed in two months after procedure, such as B-VAS in 4.48, L-VAS in 4.19 and k-ODI in 12.15 and there was the significant improvement in B- and L-VAS (p< 0.05). They were subdivided into 11 responders and 10 non-responder in EG; 5 responders and non-responders in AG. But between subdivision group, there was no statistically significancy by Chi square test (p=0.602). The mean ROI of peak contrast enhancement signal intensity in T1WI Gd enhancement study was 376.2 and peridiscal enhancement to peak enhancement of kidney ratio (PPR) was 36.87 (SD±13.53, range 10.13~60.36). The PPR was not significant correlation with successful improvement in B-VAS (R2=0.008, p >0.05), L-VAS (R2=0.017, p>0.05) and k-ODI (R2=0.025, p>0.05) a month after procedure. At a month after procedure, there was rare correlation between clinical parameters and PPR of (p>0.05).Conclusions: Based on our findings, we conclude that peridiscal contrast enhancement can be associated with an inflammatory tissue reaction in lumbar disc herniations. Moreover, contrast enhancement predict clinical symptoms, such as back and radicular pain with quality of life after ESI. After acupuncture, some symptoms were alleviated, but there was no statistical significance.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Influence of Major Coping Strategies on Treatment Non-adherence and Severity of Comorbid Conditions in Hemodialysis Patients,2018,"['Coping strategy', 'Adherence', 'Comorbidity', 'Hemodialysis', 'Problem-focused Coping strategy']",,"Background: Non-adherence and comorbidities are prevalent among hemodialysis patients and are associated with increased mortality and financial burden. We aimed to investigate the influence of major coping strategies (CSs) on non-adherence and comorbidities in hemodialysis patients.Methods: A total of 49 patients were enrolled. We collected participant data including CS measured by a Korean version of the ways of coping questionnaire (K-WCQ), comorbidities measured by age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and adherence measured by the 8-item Morisky medication adherence scale (MMAS-8).Results: Regarding major CS, 61.2% of participants reported use of support-seeking CS (SUP group), 14.3% reported use of problem-focused CS (PRO group), and 24.5% reported use of hopeful-thinking CS (HOP group). The mean MMAS-8 score was higher in the PRO group than in the HOP group (P = 0.024). The mean CCI score was lower in the PRO group than in the HOP group (P = 0.017). In the HOP group, the severity of somatic symptoms was positively correlated with the scores for the emotion-focused CS subscale (r = 0.39, P = 0.029) and the hopeful-thinking CS subscale (r = 0.38, P = 0.036) of the K-WCQ. The level of life satisfaction positively correlated with the score for the problem-focused CS subscale in the HOP group (r = 0.40, P = 0.027).Conclusion: We should pay more attention to the CSs of hemodialysis patients and provide interventions that promote problem-focused CSs, especially for nonadherent patients with high comorbidity rates who mainly use a hopeful-thinking CS.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Petrogenesis of the late Mesozoic highly fractionated I-type granites in the Luanchuan district: implications for the tectono-magmatic evolution of eastern Qinling,2018,"['geochemistry', 'petrogenesis', 'tectono-magmatic evolution', 'Luanchuan district', 'eastern Qinling']",,"Late Mesozoic granites are extensively distributed in the Luanchuan district of eastern Qinling and can be divided into two types: Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous granites (ore-related plutons) and Late Cretaceous granites (Laojunshan batholith). This study presents new geochemical and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic data from the Shibaogou and Yuku plutons to provide robust constraints on the petrogenesis and tectonic significance of the late Mesozoic granites in the Luanchuan district. Zircon U-Pb dating results yielded weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages of 149.1 ± 0.8 Ma and 150.5 ± 0.8 Ma, which were interpreted as the crystallization ages of the Shibaogou and Yuku plutons, respectively. We propose that the late Mesozoic granites contain high concentrations of SiO2 and alkali elements (Na2O + K2O) and feature metaluminous to weakly peraluminous characteristics. Enrichment in light rare earth elements and large ion lithophile elements and depletion in high field strength elements are observed. Mineralogical and geochemical evidence reveal that the late Mesozoic granites are highly fractionated I-type granites with fractional crystallization of feldspar, plagioclase and accessory minerals (e.g., apatite and titanite or magnetite). Based on the Hf composition, we suggest that the parental magmas of the ore-related plutons were derived from remelting of the Taihua and Xiong’er groups with minor contributions of mantle-derived materials and that the Laojunshan batholith was generated by the hybridization of ancient crust- (Kuanping group) and mantle-derived components. Collectively, the above arguments indicates a tectonic transition from compression to post-collisional extension during the late Mesozoic, that was likely triggered by the continental collision of the North China Block and the Yangtze Block, which generated numerous contemporaneous granites and Mo-W-Pb-Zn-Ag-Au poly-metallic deposits.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

State Estimation Network Design for Water Distribution Systems,2018,,,"<P>State estimation (SE) involves estimating state variables of interest that cannot be directly measured by using measurable variables. In water distribution system (WDS) SE, nodes are often aggregated to reduce the number of unknowns. To achieve high SE accuracy, the optimal observation locations in the WDS should be determined. This paper proposes an optimal meter placement and node grouping (OMPNG) model for WDS demand estimation (DE). The nonlinear Kalman filter (NKF) method is used to estimate the nodal group demand (NGD) from pipe flow measurements at meter locations. A k-means clustering method is introduced to generate the initial node grouping for the proposed OMPNG model. An elitism-based genetic algorithm is employed to minimize the sum of the NGD root-mean-square errors (RMSEs). The proposed OMPNG model was applied to the modified Austin network DE problem, and the results were compared with those obtained by optimizing node grouping with fixed meter locations based only on engineering sense. The results showed that the proposed OMPNG model significantly improves the DE accuracy and reliability.</P>",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

This study aimed to estimate effects of the source of household income on health care expenditure of the retirees. Based on the Korean Retirement and Income Survey (KReIS) data in 2011 and 2013, households were classified into one of the four groups―Asset income, Public pension income, Private transfer income, or Social security dependent―based on the income composition using K-means cluster analysis. Next, the effect of the major source of income on health care utilization of the retirees was estimated using the Two-Part Model analysis, after controlling for the determinants of health care utilization suggested by the Andersen Model. The results that, compared to the asset income dependent households, the health care expenditure of the pension income dependent households was 18.2% lower. In addition, the odds of using health services and the health care expenditure of the social security income dependent were 0.044 times and 53.6% lower, respectively.

Anomaly Detection in Sensor Data,2018,"['Sensor Data', 'Exploratory Data Analysis', 'Control Chart', 'ARIMA Model', 'Unsupervised Learning Algorithm']",,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to set up an anomaly detection criteria for sensor data coming from a motorcycle.Methods: Five sensor values for accelerator pedal, engine rpm, transmission rpm, gear and speed are obtained every 0.02 second from a motorcycle. Exploratory data analysis is used to find any pattern in the data. Traditional process control methods such as X control chart and time series models are fitted to find any anomaly behavior in the data. Finally unsupervised learning algorithm such as k-means clustering is used to find any anomaly spot in the sensor data.Results: According to exploratory data analysis, the distribution of accelerator pedal sensor values is very much skewed to the left. The motorcycle seemed to have been driven in a city at speed less than 45 kilometers per hour. Traditional process control charts such as X control chart fail due to severe autocorrelation in each sensor data. However, ARIMA model found three abnormal points where they are beyond 2 sigma limits in the control chart. We applied a copula based Markov chain to perform statistical process control for correlated observations. Copula based Markov model found anomaly behavior in the similar places as ARIMA model. In an unsupervised learning algorithm, large sensor values get subdivided into two, three, and four disjoint regions. So extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior in the sensor values.Conclusion: Exploratory data analysis is useful to find any pattern in the sensor data. Process control chart using ARIMA and Joe’s copula based Markov model also give warnings near similar places in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithm shows us that the extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

A bank as a party of Financial Documents and Medium and Long-term Export Insurance contracts has incentives to transfer the right under the Financial Documents for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to cash liquidity, the management of the country risk, and funding through asset securitization. Once the Financial Documents is transferred, the related party of the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance will be changed. The type of change in related party includes the change of the policyholder, what the policyholder designates the insured, and what the policyholder designates the claimant.The designation of the claimant means that the policyholder only assigns the right under the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance without transfer of position as policyholder or insured. If the right under the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance is transferred and the assignee of the subject matter insured is designated as the claimant, the effect of the insurance contract is different according to the realization of the transfer or assignment. In the case of a real sale, the insurance contract will be invalid. However, the insurance contract may be retained if the right under the Financial Documents is transferred as collateral. The former has the problem that the insurer can not exercise the right of subrogation after the payment of insurance claim, and the latter can let the insurer exercise the right of subrogation.In order to improve the soundness of the trade insurance fund and the convenience of the use of export insurance by policyholders, the suggestions are the following measures. First, the transfer of right for insurance claim should be permitted only in very limited circumstances. The transfer of claim rights without the transferring right under the Financial Documents should be permitted because creditors can freely dispose of their property. However, if the subject matter insured is transferred, transferring claim right as a means of changing the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance contract party should be avoided as it may have a negative impact on the effect of the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance contract and the economic realities of the claimant.Second, actively use the designation of insured persons. Currently, the general terms and conditions of the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance consist of insurance for policyholder themselves, so there are no clauses in relation to the insured person. The general terms and conditions is based on an insurance for oneself, but in some cases, designating an insured rather than changing policyholder may lead greater economic benefits to related parties.Even if the financing is diversified, the change of the contents of the Financial Documents under the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance will have effects as not only modification of the Financial Documents but also change of legal relationships under the Medium and Long-term Export Insurance. The further study will be needed and meaningful because as export credit insurance is operated by K-SURE with their own operating revenues and trade insurance funds, it should continue its efforts to maintain the fund’s soundness at the national policy level.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

초발 정신병 환자에서 기저핵 구조물 부피의 패턴분석,2018,,,"Objectives Dopamine dysregulation has been regarded as one of the core pathologies in patients with schizophrenia. Since dopamine synthesis capacity has found to be inconsistent in patients with schizophrenia, current classification of patients based on clinical symptoms cannot reflect the neurochemical heterogeneity of the disease. Here we performed new subtyping of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) through biotype-based cluster analysis. We specifically suggested basal ganglia structural changes as a biotype, which deeply involves in the dopaminergic circuit. Methods Forty FEP and 40 demographically matched healthy participants underwent 3T T1 MRI. Whole brain parcellation was conducted, and volumes of total 6 regions of basal ganglia have been extracted as features for cluster analysis. We used K-means clustering, and external validation was conducted with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results K-means clustering divided 40 FEP subjects into 2 clusters. Cluster 1 (n = 25) showed substantial volume decrease in 4 regions of basal ganglia compared to Cluster 2 (n = 15). Cluster 1 showed higher positive scales of PANSS compared with Cluster 2 (F = 2.333, p = 0.025). Compared to healthy controls, Cluster 1 showed smaller volumes in 4 regions, whereas Cluster 2 showed larger volumes in 3 regions. Conclusions Two subgroups have been found by cluster analysis, which showed a distinct difference in volume patterns of basal ganglia structures and positive symptom severity. The result possibly reflects the neurobiological heterogeneity of schizophrenia. Thus, the current study supports the importance of paradigm shift toward biotype-based diagnosis, instead of phenotype, for future precision psychiatry.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Recognition of damage pattern and evolution in CFRP cable with a novel bonding anchorage by acoustic emission,2018,"['CFRP cable anchorage', 'acoustic emission', 'clustering-based pattern recognition', 'ultimate bearing capacity']",,"Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) cable has good mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. However, the anchorage of CFRP cable is a big issue due to the anisotropic property of CFRP material. In this article, a high-efficient bonding anchorage with novel configuration is developed for CFRP cables. The acoustic emission (AE) technique is employed to evaluate the performance of anchorage in the fatigue test and post-fatigue ultimate bearing capacity test. The obtained AE signals are analyzed by using a combination of unsupervised K-means clustering and supervised K-nearest neighbor classification (K-NN) for quantifying the performance of the anchorage and damage evolutions. An AE feature vector (including both frequency and energy characteristics of AE signal) for clustering analysis is proposed and the under-sampling approaches are employed to regress the influence of the imbalanced classes distribution in AE dataset for improving clustering quality. The results indicate that four classes exist in AE dataset, which correspond to the shear deformation of potting compound, matrix cracking, fiber-matrix debonding and fiber fracture in CFRP bars. The AE intensity released by the deformation of potting compound is very slight during the whole loading process and no obvious premature damage observed in CFRP bars aroused by anchorage effect at relative low stress level, indicating the anchorage configuration in this study is reliable.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Anomaly Detection in Sensor Data,2018,"['Sensor Data', 'Exploratory Data Analysis', 'Control Chart', 'ARIMA Model', 'Unsupervised Learning Algorithm']",,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to set up an anomaly detection criteria for sensor data coming from a motorcycle. Methods: Five sensor values for accelerator pedal, engine rpm, transmission rpm, gear and speed are obtained every 0.02 second from a motorcycle. Exploratory data analysis is used to find any pattern in the data. Traditional process control methods such as X control chart and time series models are fitted to find any anomaly behavior in the data. Finally unsupervised learning algorithm such as k-means clustering is used to find any anomaly spot in the sensor data. Results: According to exploratory data analysis, the distribution of accelerator pedal sensor values is very much skewed to the left. The motorcycle seemed to have been driven in a city at speed less than 45 kilometers per hour. Traditional process control charts such as X control chart fail due to severe autocorrelation in each sensor data. However, ARIMA model found three abnormal points where they are beyond 2 sigma limits in the control chart. We applied a copula based Markov chain to perform statistical process control for correlated observations. Copula based Markov model found anomaly behavior in the similar places as ARIMA model. In an unsupervised learning algorithm, large sensor values get subdivided into two, three, and four disjoint regions. So extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior in the sensor values. Conclusion: Exploratory data analysis is useful to find any pattern in the sensor data. Process control chart using ARIMA and Joe's copula based Markov model also give warnings near similar places in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithm shows us that the extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

To determine the characteristics of distribution and behavior of arsenicals, multimedia environmental samples including water, suspended particles, zooplankton, sediments, and porewater were collected from inner (five sites, freshwater) and outer (five sites, saltwater) regions of the estuary dike of the Youngsan River Estuary in South Korea (Nov., 2012). Six organic and inorganic forms of As were separated and measured using HPLC–ICP/MS equipped with an anion exchange column. Concentrations of arsenicals in water samples of the inner region (mean = 1.5 μg As L<SUP>−1</SUP>) were significantly lower than in those of the outer region (mean = 5.2 μg As L<SUP>−1</SUP>). Conversely, concentrations of As in suspended particles in the inner region (mean = 14 μg As g<SUP>−1</SUP>) were much greater than in the outer region (mean = 5.7 μg As g<SUP>−1</SUP>). The field-based distribution coefficient (K<SUB>d</SUB>) for As depended strongly on salinity; relatively greater K<SUB>d</SUB> values were found in freshwater compared with saltwater.

The zooplankton species were significantly distinguishable between the inner and outer regions; cladocerans were the most dominant species in freshwater and cyclopoida were predominantly found in saltwater. The As concentrations in zooplankton were shown to be particle-concentration dependent, suggesting that dietary exposure plays a substantial role in the bioaccumulation of As.

Gait Patterns in Parkinson's Disease with or without Cognitive Impairment,2018,"['Gait', ""Parkinson's Disease"", 'Cognitive Impairment']",,"Background and Purpose: Cognitive and gait disturbance are common symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the relationship between cognitive impairment and gait dysfunction in PD has been suggested, specific gait patterns according to cognition are not fully demonstrated yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate gait patterns in PD patients with or without cognitive impairment. Methods: We studied 86 patients at an average of 4.8 years after diagnosis of PD. Cognitive impairment was defined as scoring 1.5 standard deviation below age- and education-specific means on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE). Threedimensional gait analysis was conducted for all patients and quantified gait parameters of temporal-spatial data were used. Relationships among cognition, demographic characteristics, clinical features, and gait pattern were evaluated. Results: Cognitive impairment was observed in 41 (47.7%) patients. Compared to patients without cognitive impairment, patients with cognitive impairment displayed reduced gait speed, step length, and stride length. Among K-MMSE subcategories, “registration,” “attention/calculation,” and “visuospatial function” were significantly associated with speed, step length, and stride length. However, age, disease duration, Hoehn-Yahr (HY) stage, or Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score was not significantly related to any gait analysis parameter. Conclusions: Our present study shows that cognitive impairment is associated with slow and short-stepped gait regardless of HY stage or UPDRS motor score, suggesting that cognitive impairment may serve as a surrogate marker of gait disturbance or fall in PD patients.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
A Clustering Approach for Feature Selection in Microarray Data Classification Using Random Forest,2018,"['Classification', 'Clustering', 'Dimensional Reduction', 'Microarray', 'Random Forest']",,"Microarray data plays an essential role in diagnosing and detecting cancer. Microarray analysis allows the examination of levels of gene expression in specific cell samples, where thousands of genes can be analyzed simultaneously.

Dimensional reduction can eliminate redundancy of data; thus, features used in classification are features that only have a high correlation with their class. There are two types of dimensional reduction, namely feature selection and feature extraction. In this paper, we used k-means algorithm as the clustering approach for feature selection. The proposed approach can be used to categorize features that have the same characteristics in one cluster, so that redundancy in microarray data is removed. The result of clustering is ranked using the Relief algorithm such that the best scoring element for each cluster is obtained. All best elements of each cluster are selected and used as features in the classification process. Next, the Random Forest algorithm is used. Based on the simulation, the accuracy of the proposed approach for each dataset, namely Colon, Lung Cancer, and Prostate Tumor, achieved 85.87%, 98.9%, and 89% accuracy, respectively.

Methods: We used the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries over a 19-year period (1988-2006) to examine survivorship disparities in age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital status of patients and risk status classified by histologic grade, stage, size of tumor, and number of multiple primary tumors among NMIBC patients (n=29 326). We applied Kaplan-Meier (K-M) and Cox proportional hazard methods for survival analysis. Results: Among all urinary bladder cancer patients, the majority of NMIBCs were in male (74.1%), non-Latino white (86.7%), married (67.8%), and low-risk (37.6%) to intermediate-risk (44.8%) patients. The mean age was 68 years. Survivorship (in median life years) was highest for non-Latino white (5.4 years), married (5.4 years), and low-risk (5.7 years) patients (K-M analysis, p<0.001). We found significantly lower survivorship for elderly, male (female hazard ratio [HR], 0.96), Latino (HR, 1.20), and unmarried (married HR, 0.93) patients. Conclusions: Survivorship disparities were ubiquitous across age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital status groups. Non-white, unmarried, and elderly patients had significantly shorter survivorship. The implications of these findings include the need for a heightened focus on health policy and more organized efforts to improve access to care in order to increase the chances of survival for all patients.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Anomaly Detection in Sensor Data,2018,"['Sensor Data', 'Exploratory Data Analysis', 'Control Chart', 'ARIMA Model', 'Unsupervised Learning Algorithm']",,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to set up an anomaly detection criteria for sensor data coming from a motorcycle.  Methods: Five sensor values for accelerator pedal, engine rpm, transmission rpm, gear and speed are obtained every 0.02 second from a motorcycle. Exploratory data analysis is used to find any pattern in the data. Traditional process control methods such as X control chart and time series models are fitted to find any anomaly behavior in the data. Finally unsupervised learning algorithm such as k-means clustering is used to find any anomaly spot in the sensor data.  Results: According to exploratory data analysis, the distribution of accelerator pedal sensor values is very much skewed to the left. The motorcycle seemed to have been driven in a city at speed less than 45 kilometers per hour. Traditional process control charts such as X control chart fail due to severe autocorrelation in each sensor data. However, ARIMA model found three abnormal points where they are beyond 2 sigma limits in the control chart. We applied a copula based Markov chain to perform statistical process control for correlated observations. Copula based Markov model found anomaly behavior in the similar places as ARIMA model. In an unsupervised learning algorithm, large sensor values get subdivided into two, three, and four disjoint regions. So extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior in the sensor values.  Conclusion: Exploratory data analysis is useful to find any pattern in the sensor data. Process control chart using ARIMA and Joe’s copula based Markov model also give warnings near similar places in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithm shows us that the extreme sensor values are the ones that need to be tracked down for any sign of anomaly behavior.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The Influence of Hen Aging on Eggshell Ultrastructure and Shell Mineral Components,2018,"['aging', 'eggshell ultrastructure', 'eggshell components ions', 'chicken']",,"The eggshell, which is a complex and highly ordered structure, is very important factor for food safety and egg marketing. This study investigated the changes in eggshell structure and shell components in relationship to hen age. For this study, we examined the histological change of the endometrium of the 30-, 60-, and 72-wk-old commercial layers, and analyzed the ultrastructure and ionic composition of their eggshells. The results showed that histological deformation, fibrosis, atrophy and elimination of micro-villi in the uterus endometrium were found through microscopic observation that was associated with increasing hen age. Concentration of blood-ion components such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions did not change with age. Along with the results from the ultrastructure analysis of the eggshell, the palisade layer ratio and the density of mammillary knobs were significantly decreased in older hens. In addition, the type B mammillary knobs were frequently observed with increasing hen age. In the mineral element assay from the eggshell, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, S<sup>2-</sup> , and Co<sup>2+</sup> significantly decreased with increasing hen age, whereas Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and V<sup>2+</sup> significantly increased. Therefore, the damages of endometrial tissue inhibit the processes of ion transmission and the crystallization of eggshell formation, resulting in a large and non-uniform mammillary knob formation. This means the conditions of endometrial cells affect the formation of the eggshell structure. In conclusion, hen aging causes the weakness of the eggshell and degrades the eggshell quality.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Mitigation of N2O emissions can be more effective in controlling biochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification in the soil rather than decreasing fertilizer application. The use of urease inhibitors is an effective way to improve N fertilizer efficiency and reduce N2O emissions. Several compounds act as urease inhibitors, but N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) has been used worldwide.METHODS AND RESULTS: Hot pepper and chinese cabbage were cultivated in five treatments: standard fertilizer of nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium(N-P-K, NP2O5- K2O: 22.5-11.2-14.9 kg/ha for hot pepper and N-P2O5-K2O: 32.0-7.8-19.8 kg/ha for chinese cabbage), no fertilizer, and NBPT-treated fertilizer of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 times of nitrogen basal application rate of the standard fertilizer, respectively in Gyeonggi-do Hwaseong-si for 2 years(2015-2016). According to application of NBPTtreated fertilizer in hot pepper and chinese cabbage, N2O emission decreased by 19-20% compared to that of the standard fertilizer plot.CONCLUSION: NBPT-treated fertilizer proved that N2O emissions decreased statistically significant in the same growth conditions as the standard fertilization in the hot pepper and chinese cabbage cultivated fields. It means that NBPT-treated fertilizer can be applied for N fertilizer efficiency and N2O emissions reduction.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The Buddha emphasized the middle position between fasting and over-eating in dietary practice. He did not approve fasting nor over-eating because the former was a kind of self-mortification and the latter was a kind of indulgence in sensual pleasure and generated sloth-and-torpor (thīna-middha). For the Buddha, both were not conductive to awakening. Therefore, the middle position between fasting and over-eating is moderation in eating (bhojane mattammutā). According to Early Buddhism, food as an materiality (rūpa) can be an object of sensual craving (kāma-rāga) which belongs to the five lower fetters (pamca-orambhāgiyāni-saṃyojanāni) tie us to the sensuous sphere (kāmādhātu). It is for this reason that ‘how to eat’ is more important than ‘what to eat’ in Early Buddhism. This attitude is comes about through wise attention (yoniso manasikāra) before taking food and mindfulness and awareness (sati-sampajāmma) while taking food. Wise attention (yoniso manasikāra) for taking food is shown in the Buddha’s admonition for monastics to take food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the endurance and continuance of his body, for ending discomfort, and for assisting the holy life. Eating without mindfulness and awareness (sati-sampajāmma) tends to eat fast without noticing pleasurable sensation (sukha-vedanā) on tongue, and thus leads to over-eating and gluttony. In a sense, the early Buddhist dietary practice is closely related to the modern concept of ‘mindful eating’ which means eating with the attention necessary for noticing and enjoying your food and ‘slow food movement’ which initially aims to defend regional traditions, good food, gastronomic pleasure and a slow pace of life. Thus, we can safely say that early Buddhist dietary practice not only applicable to monastics but also to ordinary people who seek well-bing in contemporary society.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Data were obtained on 570 one-person households from the 2016 Food Consumption Survey conducted by the Korea Rural Economic Institute. K-means cluster analysis and two-way analysis of variance were performed.Among the one-person households, there were four different types of dietary lifestyles: (1)the type that was passive and preferred small-packed foods(PS), (2)the type that was high- quality-oriented and health-oriented(HH), (3)the type that preferred eating-out, home meal replacement products, and lower-priced foods(HL), and (4)the type that was indifferent to the dietary life(ID). Differences in demographic characteristic, dietary characteristics, and dietary life satisfaction levels were statistically significant among the four consumer types. Households of the HH type had the highest nutritional intake and satisfaction levels. The ID type was the most vulnerable type with regard to eating habits, dietary satisfaction, and consumer competency.

Therefore, it is of much significance to develop a monitoring and diagnosis system for the FDM process to overcome such drawbacks. In this paper, a data-driven FDM process monitoring and diagnosis system is developed by using two types of sensors – an accelerometer and an acoustic emission (AE) sensor. A large number of experimental data, collected from the accelerometers and AE sensor under healthy and faulty process states, are processed to obtain a critical feature – a root mean square (RMS). The RMS values are then used for training the FDM process monitoring and diagnosis models based on a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and a k-fold cross validation approach. In particular, the SVM-based models for the odd- and even-numbered layers of one FDM specimen are developed. For a real-time validation in a factory floor, the non-linear SVM-based models using the acceleration signals are used for the software development. The diagnosis accuracy is better than 87.5%, and an applicability of the models is verified.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The varieties, K68 and HD2643, exhibited maximum stay green compared to other varieties. LR caused reduction in biological (35%) and economic (46%) yield of wheat. Among the indices, mean productivity (MP), geometric mean (GM), stress tolerance index (STI), and yield index (YI) were positively correlated (P ≤ 0.05) with grain yield under LR (Ys) and NR (Yp). Cluster analysis indicated that varieties – HD2643, K68, Kalyansona, and C306 varieties were most LR tolerant, while DL1266-1, DL1266-2, and Moti were moderately tolerant and rest of the varieties exhibited LR susceptibility.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The CSST for tubing consists of a tube, protective coating, nut, yellowinsulation ring, packing, and socket. In addition, it is thought that a yellow insulation ring and rubber packing were usedto connect the tube and socket in order to improve the airtightness and insulation performance. The result of the verificationof the data acquired from the tests in the 95% confidence interval shows that the Anderson-Darling (AD) and P value wereanalyzed to be 0.945 and 0.015, respectively. This confirms that the test data of the CSST for tubing is reliable. Theanalysis of the arithmetic mean of the insulation resistance of a CSST showed that the CSST damaged by burning by atorch, and the one damaged by electrical burning, was 16.7 kΩ (the greatest relatively) and 208 Ω (the lowest),respectively, while it was 1.72 kΩ in the case of a normal product. Therefore, the analysis result of the insulation resistanceof the CSST collected from the scene of a fire can be utilized to examine the cause of damage by burning. In addition,it was found that when the maximum current of 97 A was applied to the CSST for about 5 s using a Primary CurrentInjection Test System (PCITS) the protective film and insulation ring of the CSST has no difference from that of a normalproduct. However, a part of the metal tube was melted.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Experimental Study on the Permeability Characteristics of Sandstone in Different Chemical Solutions,2018,"['soft rock', 'experiment', 'permeability characteristics', 'water-rock interaction', 'seepage pressure']",,"Groundwater seepage is one of the important factors which affect the physical and mechanical properties of soft rock. In this study, the permeability evolution of sandstone was investigated using water solution seepage tests with different pH values. The results show that the chemical nature of the solutions has a great influence on the evolution of the permeability coefficients of sandstone specimens. Over time, it was determined that the permeability coefficient under the solution with PH = 2 was significantly greater than those under the PH = 7 and PH = 12 solutions used in this study. During the infiltrations, the ions of H+ and OH- which were involved in the water-rock interaction made the pH value of the solution change with different degrees. After the seepage, the ions in the solutions changed significantly. The ion concentrations seeping from sandstone specimen in the acidic solution, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe3+ (Fe2+), Al3+ and K+, were found to be much greater than in the neutral and alkaline solutions. However, the ion concentrations seeping from sandstone specimen in the neutral solution displayed little differences from those in the alkaline solution. The concentration of the Si ion in the alkaline solution was much higher than those of the acid and neutral solutions, and the concentration of the acid solution was slightly higher than that of the neutral solution. The changes in the ion concentration in the osmotic solution reflected that there had been different forms of chemical reactions between the minerals of the sandstone and the solutions. The seepage pressures also had some effects on the permeability coefficients, pH values, and concentrations of ions in the solutions. After the seepage tests, the rock microstructures were observed by the means of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).The results show that some new holes have been formed in the sandstone specimen due to the seepage, especially in the sample with the acid solution. The internal structural changes of the sandstone are found to be the main reasons for the changes in the permeability coefficients.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can help to diagnose AD and assist in further treatment strategies. The morphological alterations of lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum are considered a significant imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of MCI and AD. Shape-based features provide distinct morphological variations of brain structures during disease progression. In this research, an attempt has been made to analyze the variations of lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum using Zernike moments and fractal box count features. These shape features help to classify the morphological structure of lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum as control, MCI, and AD. The proposed method can quantify the shape variations using Zernike moments and fractal box count features. Here, Zernike moments and fractal box count measures show differences in mean values for control, MCI, and AD subjects with a statistical significance of p<0.05. Performance is analyzed using multilayer perceptron, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Linear SVM provides better differentiation for controls vs. MCI and controls vs. AD on the order of 93% and 98%, respectively. Results show that the classification of shape descriptors performs better with respect to accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity measures. Therefore, this study is clinically important for the early diagnosis of AD.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
ACCELERATION OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS BY TCHEBYCHEV ITERATION TECHNIQUE,2018,,,"Recently Machine Learning algorithms are widely used to process Big Data in various applications and a lot of these applications are executed in run time. Therefore the speed of Machine Learning algorithms is a critical issue in these applications. However the most of modern iteration Machine Learning algorithms use a successive iteration technique well-known in Numerical Linear Algebra. But this technique has a very low convergence, needs a lot of iterations to get solution of considering problems and therefore a lot of time for processing even on modern multi-core computers and clusters. Tchebychev iteration technique is well-known in Numerical Linear Algebra as an attractive candidate to decrease the number of iterations in Machine Learning iteration algorithms and also to decrease the running time of these algorithms those is very important especially in run time applications. In this paper we consider the usage of Tchebychev iterations for acceleration of well-known K-Means and SVM (Support Vector Machine) clustering algorithms in Machine Leaning. Some examples of usage of our approach on modern multi-core computers under Apache Spark framework will be considered and discussed.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

While both OCF and earnings are used as key performance indicators, OCF is a secondary rather than primary information under accrual accounting. Thus, considering costs of retrieving and processing this additional information, information users may find it optimal to rely more on the sign rather than the magnitude of OCF. This creates incentives to avoid negative OCF through OCF management.The main findings of this study are summarized as follows. First, we observe an abnormal distribution of OCF around zero, which is analogous to that of earnings. Specifically, we find lower-than-expected frequencies of small negative OCF and higher-than-expected frequencies of small positive OCF. Second, we investigate specific means through which managers avoid negative OCF. Particularly, we focus on the adoption of K-IFRS which allows cash flows arising from the receipt/payment of interest or dividend to be classified as one of operating/investing/financing activities in accordance with their economic substance. We analyze whether firms use their discretion to avoid reporting negative OCF and find that firms engage in the opportunistic activity classification when negative OCF under the classification method of K-GAAP turns positive through the OCF maximizing classification method.This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence that firms have incentives to avoid negative OCF in addition to the incentives to avoid losses and that the discretion in the activity classification offered by K-IFRS can be exploited as a means to that end.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Path Generation Method of UAV Autopilots using Max-Min Algorithm,2018,"['Autopilot', 'Max-Min Algorithm', 'Path Generation', 'Unmanned Aerial Vehicle']",,"In recent times, Natural User Interface/Natural User Experience (NUI/NUX) technology has foundwidespread application across a diverse range of fields and is also utilized for controlling unmanned aerialvehicles (UAVs). Even if the user controls the UAV by utilizing the NUI/NUX technology, it is difficult forthe user to easily control the UAV. The user needs an autopilot to easily control the UAV. The user needs aflight path to use the autopilot. The user sets the flight path based on the waypoints. UAVs normally flystraight from one waypoint to another. However, if flight between two waypoints is in a straight line, UAVsmay collide with obstacles. In order to solve collision problems, flight records can be utilized to adjust thegenerated path taking the locations of the obstacles into consideration. This paper proposes a natural pathgeneration method between waypoints based on flight records collected through UAVs flown by users.Bayesian probability is utilized to select paths most similar to the flight records to connect two waypoints.These paths are generated by selection of the center path corresponding to the highest Bayesian probability.While the K-means algorithm-based straight-line method generated paths that led to UAV collisions, theproposed method generates paths that allow UAVs to avoid obstacles.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

A Scalable Feature Based Clustering Algorithm for Sequences with Many Distinct Items,2018,"['Sequence data', 'Feature-based clustering', 'Frequent sequential patterns']",,"Various sequence data have grown explosively in recent years. As more and more of such data become available, clustering is needed to understand the structure of sequence data. However, the existing clustering algorithms for sequence data are computationally demanding. To avoid such a problem, a feature-based clustering algorithm has been proposed. Notwithstanding that, the algorithm uses only a subset of all possible frequent sequential patterns as features, which may result in the distortion of similarities between sequences in practice, especially when dealing with sequence data with a large number of distinct items such as customer transaction data. Developed in this article is a feature-based clustering algorithm using a complete set of frequent sequential patterns as features for sequences of sets of items as well as sequences of single items which consist of many distinct items. The proposed algorithm projects sequence data into feature space whose dimension consists of a complete set of frequent sequential patterns, and then, employs K-means clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm generates more meaningful clusters than the compared algorithms regardless of the dataset and parameters such as the minimum support value of frequent sequential patterns and the number of clusters considered. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be applied to a large sequence database since it is linearly scalable to the number of sequence data.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Prospective Clinical Trial of Corneal Reconstruction With Biomaterial-Free Cultured Oral Mucosal Epithelial Cell Sheets,2018,,,"PURPOSE:: To investigate the efficacy and safety of transplantation with biomaterial-free cultured oral mucosal epithelial cell sheets (COMECs) for ocular reconstruction in subjects with total limbal stem cell deficiency. METHODS:: A prospective clinical trial (NCT02149732) was conducted in 8 subjects with total limbal stem cell deficiency after approval from the institutional review board of Seoul National University Hospital (H-0707-043-213) and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of Korea. COMECs were prepared in a culture system without the use of any temperature-sensitive polymers or carriers. The COMECs were transplanted without suture fixation. Four subjects underwent penetrating keratoplasty after stabilization of the COMEC transplant. Stable epithelialization, changes in visual acuity, and postoperative complications were evaluated for 6 months. Corneal cytokeratins (K) of 4 subjects who underwent penetrating keratoplasty were stained with an immunofluorescent agent. RESULTS:: The ocular surface was successfully reconstructed in 6 eyes. Complete stable epithelialization was achieved within a mean of 53.6 days. Visual improvement (≥2 lines) was achieved in 62.5% of the eyes. K12 (corneal phenotype), K4, and K13 (mucosal phenotype) were well expressed in grafts after keratoplasty, whereas K1, K8, and K19 were barely expressed. No ocular infections, local tumor formation, or remarkable systemic complications were observed. Ocular reconstruction using COMECs failed in 2 eyes, which had full symblepharon in 4 quadrants. CONCLUSIONS:: Transplanting biomaterial-free COMECs seems to be an efficient and safe procedure to reconstruct the ocular surface in patients who are completely limbal stem cell deficient without a full symblepharon.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Accuracy of swimming wearable watches for estimating energy expenditure,2018,"['Wearable device', 'Swimming', 'Lap count', 'Stroke count', 'Energy expenditure']",,"With the recent installation of waterproof function on wearable watches, various sports activities including walking, running and even swimming are monitored. Commercially available swimming wearable watches automatically identified stroke type, swim distance, stroke counts and energy expenditure (EE). Although the accuracy of estimating EE of walking, bilking and activities of daily life on activity monitors have been evaluated, it has not been examined for swimming. Thus, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of estimating EE for swimming wearable watches (Apple Watch S2, Apple and Garmin Finex 3HR, Garmin). A total of 78 swimmers aged 20-59 years (female: 48%) participated in the study. All the participants wore Apple and Garmin and completed a set of swimming protocol comprising various speeds (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 m/s). At each swimming speed they were asked to swim for four minutes. Lap counts, stroke counts and energy expenditure (EE) from the Apple and Garmin were evaluated with the criterion measures. Lap counts and stroke counts were directly counted by the research assistant. The portable respiratory gas analyzer (K4b2, Cosmed, Italy) and a swimming snorkel (Aqua Trainer Snorkel, Cosmed, Italy) was used as the criterion measure of EE. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of lap counting and stroke counts at various swimming speed were within 10% for Apple (lap counts: 0.5-6.1%, stroke counts: 6.2-9.3%) and about 20% for Garmin (lap counts: 0-20.6%, stroke counts: 6.8-17.6%). However, the MAPE of EE was higher for Apple (17.1%-151.7%) than for Garmin (17.9%-32.7%). The accuracy of estimating EE tended to improve with increasing swimming speed for both Apple and Garmin. The EEs from Apple were outside the equivalence zone except for at 1.2 m/s and were overestimated compared to the criteria. On the other hand, EEs from Garmin were within the equivalence zone at all speeds except for 1.2 m/s. In conclusion, Apple and Garmin wearable watches accurately measure lap counts and stroke counts. However, the accuracy of estimating EE are poor at slow to medium swimming speed. Further improvement is needed to estimate energy expenditure of swimming at various speed.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Cluster analyses have identified several phenotypes and variables related to fixed airway obstruction; however, few longitudinal studies of lung function have been performed on adult asthmatics. We investigated clinical, demographic, and inflammatory factors related to persistent airflow limitation based on lung function trajectories over 1 year.Methods: Serial post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume (FEV) 1% values were obtained from 1,679 asthmatics who were followed up every 3 months for 1 year. First, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using Ward's method to generate a dendrogram for the optimum number of clusters using the complete post-FEV1 sets from 448 subjects. Then, a trajectory cluster analysis of serial post-FEV1 sets was performed using the k-means clustering for the longitudinal data trajectory method. Next, trajectory clustering for the serial post-FEV1 sets of a total of 1,679 asthmatics was performed after imputation of missing post-FEV1 values using regression methods.Results: Trajectories 1 and 2 were associated with normal lung function during the study period, and trajectory 3 was associated with a reversal to normal of the moderately decreased baseline FEV1 within 3 months. Trajectories 4 and 5 were associated with severe asthma with a marked reduction in baseline FEV1. However, the FEV1 associated with trajectory 4 was increased at 3 months, whereas the FEV1 associated with trajectory 5 was persistently disturbed over 1 year. Compared with trajectory 4, trajectory 5 was associated with older asthmatics with less atopy, a lower immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, sputum neutrophilia and higher dosages of oral steroids. In contrast, trajectory 4 was associated with higher sputum and blood eosinophil counts and more frequent exacerbations.Conclusions: Trajectory clustering analysis of FEV1 identified 5 distinct types, representing well-preserved to severely decreased FEV1. Persistent airflow obstruction may be related to non-atopy, a low IgE level, and older age accompanied by neutrophilic inflammation and low baseline FEV1 levels.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Skin colors of face (forehead, right and left cheeks) and body (back of neck, inner arm) of the residents of Beijing and Shanghai were measured using the Minolta CM-600d spectrophotometer. Collected CIE L * a * b * values and Munsell HVC values were analyzed using the SPSS software. Face and body colors of the females of 2 cities were all fell in the YR hue type.Independent t-test on the body colors of females resulted in a significant difference (p=.000) between Beijing and Shanghai on most variables which indicated that females of Beijing had more yellowness in their neck and darker arm than the females of Shanghai.Linear regression analysis which was conducted to investigate the relationship between the face colors and the body colors indicated that the L * a * b * values of face and body of both cities were positively related. When K-means cluster analysis was conducted regarding the whole samples, the females were grouped into 3 groups based on their L * a * b * values. Group 1 had the darkest skin color with high redness and yellowness, Group 2 had the lightest skin color with least yellowness and redness, Group 3 had the medium skin color with high yellowness. Highest proportion of Beijing females fell into Group 1 (38.9%) whereas the same number of females were Groups 2 and Group 3. More than half (56.7%) of Shanghai females belonged to Group 3, with 25.0% of Group 2 and 18.3% of Group 3. The result implies that overall the females of Beijing had darker skin color with yellowness than the females of Shanghai.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

A Solution Procedure for Emergency Logistics Problem in Disaster Scene,2018,"['Disaster', 'Response System', 'Emergency Vehicle Routing Problem', 'Coordination', 'Genetic Algorithm']",,"In 2000s, the frequency of natural disasters occurrence has increased continuously. Due to abnormal climate change, natural disasters such as torrential downpours and typhoons have been occurring more frequently. Therefore, need for research on an effective disaster response system is emphasized.Nonetheless, the existing disaster response systems are not yet efficient. This study deals with the distributed emer-gency vehicle routing problem for emergency logistics in disaster situations. This problem has different characteristics from the general vehicle route problem.This study suggests a solution procedure that consists of two parts. The one is to generate an emergency vehicle rout-ing plan for individual vehicle and the other is to coordinate those plans for headquarter. The algorithm for generating a routing plan is made up optimization technique using the integer programming and a metaheuristic using the genetic algorithm.

Indian Buddhist narrative genres of Jātaka and Avādana refer to such practices as Bodhisattva’s heroic examples of abandoning the body. In East Asian countries and Vietnam, auto-cremation has been most commonly practiced among many forms of self-immolation to protest against persecution, or to pay homage to the Buddha. This act is not confined to Mahāyāna Buddhist world. There have been cases, if not many, of this striking forms of self-immolation in Theravāda Buddhist world these days. With this paper, I discuss Buddhist perspectives on self-immolation on the basis of Pāli canon and its commentaries. Firstly, as in the case of suicide, self-immolation cuts short his or her opportunity to attain liberation, before having made proper use of human life to its fullest potential. Secondly, self-immolation should be included in self-modification or asceticism because it causes extreme physical pains and even leads to death. As is well known, the Buddha does not consider the undertaking of austerities as a necessary prerequisites for liberation. Thirdly, self-immolation is an act motivated or urged by craving for non-existence (vibhava-taṇhā) and is rooted in personality-belief (sakkāya-diṭṭhi) or ego-belief (atta-diṭṭhi). Self-immolation is against self-love (attā-piya) or self-affection (atta-kāma) which is highly appreciated as a source for lovingkindness (mettā) towards other beings. Thus, I can safely say that self-immolation is not in keeping with the original teaching of the Buddha and that self-immolation cannot be recognized as heroic or noble by no means.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Female Body Shape Classifications and Their Significant Impact on Fabric Utilization,2018,"['Body shape clustering', 'Moore neighbor algorithm', 'Region prop function', 'PCA', 'Fabric utilization']",,"In apparel manufacturing, more than 50 % cost is consumed by the textile fabric. Therefore companies have significant apprehensions in the fabric utilization. It can result in more efficient and cost-effective in fabric utilization if they are related to different body shapes. The purpose of this study is to classify female body shapes and evaluate fabric utilization efficiency for each category of the body shape. To this end, three dimensional (3D) body scans are collected from 124 young female subjects. For the body shape analysis, 3D body scans are processed by using Moore neighbor algorithm and region prop function to perceive the outermost shell. Moreover, both front and side view of the scans is processed for data reduction using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering using K-Means ++. It has been observed through our analysis of a dataset that female bodies can be categorized into four body shapes, that is, oval shape, circle shape, triangle shape, and rectangle shape. It has also been observed that all four body shape categories exhibit dissimilar anthropometric size measures. The result implies that these body shapes have devoured different fabric utilization for the garments (fitted trouser and fitted shirt). It has been noted that in fitted trouser and fitted shirt the most effective is the rectangle shape (cluster 4) and the least is the circle shape (cluster 2) in the fabric consumption. Similarly, the fitted trousers utilize less fabric while the fitted shirts consume more fabric in all body shapes. These findings provide a better reference of fabric utilization and cost-effectiveness to the apparel manufacturers while producing garments for different categories of the body shape.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

In order to effectively supply, cut off, and operate an electric power system, many electric power facilities such as gas insulation switch (GIS), cable, and large substation facilities with higher densities are being developed to meet demand. However, because of the increased use of aging electric power facilities, safety problems are emerging. Electromagnetic wave and leakage current detection are mainly used as sensing methods to detect live-line partial discharges. Although electromagnetic sensors are excellent at providing an initial diagnosis and very reliable, it is difficult to precisely determine the fault point, while leakage current sensors require a connection to the ground line and are very vulnerable to line noise. The partial discharge characteristic in particular is accompanied by statistical irregularity, and it has been reported that proper statistical processing of data is very important.

For this purpose, I clarified the contents of āsavas and proposed methods to destruct them and, as a result, to lead people to the liberation. Specifically, I scrutinized the achievement of cetovimutti and paññāvimutti by insight of ariyasaccāni that is the way of destruction of āsavas in the system of cattāri ariyasaccāni.The four āsavas in the Pāli literature are in a corresponding relationship with the ten saṃyojanas removed at each stage of the saints; how to remove the saṃyojanas is the way to destroy the āsavas. Each āsava is destroyed by the achievement of jhāna and the insight of aniccaㆍdukkhaㆍanattā the way that is equal but different in its degrees. This way of destruction of āsavas is not only the content of ‘the insight of ariyasaccāni’ functioning in the destruction of each āsava but also the way of achieving the insight itself.The liberation in the system of cattāri ariyasaccāni is the emancipation from dukkha, pañcupādānakkhandhā, by destroying taṇhā which is the cause of dukkha. Taṇhā is destroyed by the insight of aniccaㆍdukkhaㆍanattā, following the achievement of the fourth jhāna, which means sammāsamādhi, the last factor of ariya aṭṭhaṅgika magga. This state that taṇhā is destroyed is cetovimutti. Since the destruction of taṇhā means the destruction of dukkha, Arahant’s cetovimutti is not different from the actual liberation in the cattāri ariyasaccāni. However, complete liberation is accomplished by achieving the insight of ariyasaccāni which is attained by that realization and destroying avijjā, that is, by achieving paññāvimutti. In this way, the liberation of Arahant is completed with the state of these two liberations.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Studies on essays also point out that Lee’s essay focused on intelligence and cultural Buildung has neutralized the resistance movement of young people of the time. However, reconsidering his work as an editor, and rereading his creative activities such as columns, essays, and novels, one can confirm that Lee, who argued against the literary mainstream of the 1950s, is seeking a reformation of the literary generations again after 4.19.In the late 1960s, when the literary magazines of new generation, such as Creation and Criticism(Changjakwabipyeong) began to appear, leading the reform of the literary atmosphere with the quaterly magazine system, the first issue of Korean literature(Hankookmoonhak, Hyeonam publisher) was published. The magazine has leaded generation discourse since its first publication.Lee understood this period as the proper time of generational shift in Korean literature.

For this, based on reviews on the Malcolm Bolridge Model widely applied in many organizationsas an evaluation model to diagnose and improve the capacities of organizations, the major factors of K-HRM were examined and a scale to measure this as a first research was developed. Scale development was comprised of two stages. The first stage is the theoretical studies of researchers and it selected the HRM features ofKorean companies needing assertive management related to the major factors. In the second stage, group discussions were held with working-level employees of HR organizations of Korean companies focusing mainly on the contents sorted through the theoretical reviews to develop the detailed scales for each of the final factors. Thedeveloped scales were divided into seven factors such as leadership, human resources, processes, strategy, customer/market, environmental response, and performance. For each individual factor, 3-4 sub-factors were included and for each of the sub-factors, scales comprised of three questions were developed. In addition, the Korean companies were categorized as manufacturing and non-manufacturing (service) businesses to check thestatistical significance level of the developed scale through empirical analyses on the surveys.

Sipjipum 十地品), in the Collection of Annotations of Avatamsaka Sutra (K. Hwaeomsocho 華嚴疏鈔) in order to highlight the unique features and differences of their understandings of Buddhism. Earlier studies, such as an account by a Buddhist monk from the modern period, Park Han-young, have revealed that Yeondam and Inak had a distant relationship, in regard of the periodical surroundings of their times and their different views on Buddhism. But this study tries to suggest definite evidences of an academic interchange between them by examining their annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra. Shown below is the three evidence of the contention. Firstly, only from Yeondam’s collection of annotations, Yumanggi (Ch. 遺忘記), explanatory diagrams (K. Gwado 科圖) are found. Secondly, the comments on the annotations of the Avatamsaka Sutra made by Seolpa, Yeondam, and Inak all have traces of amendments. Thirdly, the collections of annotations of Yeondam and Inak have dealt with the same issue but they explained it in a different manner. On the basis of these three evidences, it is possible to assume that they each made annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra in different times and manners. Given the fact that the annotations from latter date added new explanations to its preceding writings, it is reasonable to understand that there were academic interchanges between the three monks. As a result of examinations on Yeondam and Inak’s annotations, the former seems to have pursued deeper understandings on the meaning of the Avatamsaka Sutra while the latter have aimed to conduct meticulous examinations. This study also tried to elucidate the difference of Yeondam and Inak’s understandings on the meaning of the Avatamsaka Sutra. As an example, about the meaning of a phrase “都無所得”, which is read as “there is nothing to gain”, from the Collection of Annotations of Avatamsaka Sutra, Yeondam tried to interpret those words from the perspective of Yogacara Thought, while Inak tried to read them in the relation with the Avatamsaka Study. Yeondam’s approach to deal with the issue on the basis of the phenomenal world and Inak’s approach to explain it from the view of fundamental world suggest their different Buddhist perception. This study examines only a small part of the two monks’ annotations on the Avatamsaka Sutra in order to highlight the differences in their thought. It is anticipated that more detailed analysis on the rest of their writings will reveal further distinctive features of their ideas on Buddhism.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

He introduces the concept of śakti to solve the contradiction between the unity of Brahman and diversity of the world. Through Bhartṛhari’s redefinition of the six categories (padārtha) of Vaiśeṣika, Brahman can become a cause of world diversity and at the same time secure its own unity.  Bhartṛhari deals with four major śaktis, that is, direction (dik), means (sādhana), action (kriyā), and time (kāla), in the Padakāṇḍa, the third volume of his main work, Vākyapadīya. Direction and time are the basis of recognition, which is the driving force for all actions, but there is always action at the heart of the process of making the world evolve from the One. Therefore, his theory of action necessarily evolves with ontology.   In this paper, I focus on the contents of ‘Kriyāsamuddeśa’ of the Padakāṇḍa and Bhartṛhari’s concepts of action and being. First, I examine the definition, recognition, and expression of action, and then examine the process in which the verb root √as, which is only a copula, becomes a universal concept covering all acts. And I analyze the reason that sattā, which is only an abstract noun of √as, has the meaning of the Universal or Supreme Being, and substitutes the specific title of Brahman. Through these analyses, I intend to reveal the process in which Bhartṛhari’s theory of action results in a metaphysical ontology.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

This study addresses special issues that have caused disputes in the field concerning various regulations of stock nominal trust donation that has emerged when stock acquisition and borrowed account have come together The current study is significant in that it comes up with the methodology of interpreting new issues based on an analysis of previous judicial precedents and new issues based on such analysis at a time when an interpretation of the law is not available as yet in the case of unlisted stocks while judicial decision is now available concerning the issue of listed stocks. The study is based on literature research including dissertations published in previous academic journals, dissertations for academic degrees, precedents by the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court and so forth.The study analyzes the judicial decision Supreme Court 2017.2.21, Announcement 2011DU10232, where it was at issue whether deemed donation applies to each of the stocks where the title was transferred after transfer of the title for the first time in case the title was transferred several times regarding listed stocks acquired while investing in stocks using securities account in the children’s name, and draws the conclusion with regard to whether regulations on nominal trust deemed donation are to apply.In case the actual owner has gone so far as to transfer the title of listed stocks he or she came to own while investing in stocks using borrowed securities accounts to a person other than the actual owner, the conclusion that the judicial decision of the Supreme Court 2017. 2. 21. Announcement 2011DU10232 drew that has limitedly applied the Regulation of name trust donation is valid. However, the conclusion leaves something to be desired in that the ground for the agreement on the nominal trust between the actual owner and the nominee has not been evidently presented.In case of a non-listed stock, where transactions are gradually being market-oriented, actually in the case of transactions via K-OTC, chances are that problems associated with nominal trust equal to listed stocks will arise. In the case of transactions according to securities account of unlisted stocks, whether nominal trust deemed donation applies would not differ from the case of listed stocks. Though the handling of listed and unlisted stocks in terms of tax laws shows itself in transfer income tax and so forth, denial of the stock acquired after the stocks initially acquired on the ground of failing to meet the requirement for consensus does not need to be differentiated between listed and unlisted stocks. Ultimately, when a securities account is opened and unlisted stock transactions are made, and in case the sale price of the stock initially acquired is entered in the borrowed securities account, and other unlisted stocks were acquired with the sale price, as to whether nominal trust donation regulations apply to unlisted stocks other than unlisted stocks initially acquired, “the application negation theory” is appropriate.

The emotions induced by a particular color may differ among individuals, but many previous experiments, study papers, reports, and other literature support the hypothesis that color could have psychological effects.In visual media such as television and films, we can see numerous examples of psychological and symbolic interpretation of colors being perceived as a significant component of visual atmosphere production and used to form a dramatic atmosphere or imply a character’s emotional status of the narrative. Color expression in visual media has overcome many of its limitations through technological developments in both hardware and software dimensions, and it is now possible to display lively colors on screen. Furthermore, it is no longer difficult to select and apply colors on the computer graphics system. Nevertheless, it remains challenging for artists to select the best color that induces emotional reaction while being in line with the narrative of the clip from the enormous set of colors of the analog spectrum.The study of this paper aims to provide a reference basis for color selection contingent upon narratives for emotional expression of ocean scenes which frequently appear on video contents such as films, television programs, advertisements, and media arts. The sample selection of the colors is based on scenes of Disney’s animated film <Moana, 2016> which livelily expresses various emotions of the ocean even more than the reality. For color analysis, 195 emotional colors of the ocean are extracted based on the PAD model through the K-Mean Clustering method with three emotional groups: relaxation, pleasure, and excitement.This Study has led to a meaningful conclusion to analyze the ocean color characteristics affecting emotional change.

The stock price forecasting research is classified into structured data and unstructured data, and it is divided into technical analysis, fundamental analysis and media effect analysis in detail.  In the big data era, research on stock price prediction combining big data is actively underway. Based on a large number of data, stock prediction research mainly focuses on machine learning techniques. Especially, research methods that combine the effects of media are attracting attention recently, among which researches that analyze online news and utilize online news to forecast stock prices are becoming main.  Previous studies predicting stock prices through online news are mostly sentiment analysis of news, making different corpus for each company, and making a dictionary that predicts stock prices by recording responses according to the past stock price. Therefore, existing studies have examined the impact of online news on individual companies. For example, stock movements of Samsung Electronics are predicted with only online news of Samsung Electronics. In addition, a method of considering influences among highly relevant companies has also been studied recently. For example, stock movements of Samsung Electronics are predicted with news of Samsung Electronics and a highly related company like LG Electronics.These previous studies examine the effects of news of industrial sector with homogeneity on the individual company. In the previous studies, homogeneous industries are classified according to the Global Industrial Classification Standard. In other words, the existing studies were analyzed under the assumption that industries divided into Global Industrial Classification Standard have homogeneity.  However, existing studies have limitations in that they do not take into account influential companies with high relevance or reflect the existence of heterogeneity within the same Global Industrial Classification Standard sectors. As a result of our examining the various sectors, it can be seen that there are sectors that show the industrial sectors are not a homogeneous group. To overcome these limitations of existing studies that do not reflect heterogeneity, our study suggests a methodology that reflects the heterogeneous effects of the industrial sector that affect the stock price by applying k-means clustering. Multiple Kernel Learning is mainly used to integrate data with various characteristics. Multiple Kernel Learning has several kernels, each of which receives and predicts different data. To incorporate effects of target firm and its relevant firms simultaneously, we used Multiple Kernel Learning. Each kernel was assigned to predict stock prices with variables of financial news of the industrial group divided by the target firm, K-means cluster analysis.  In order to prove that the suggested methodology is appropriate, experiments were conducted through three years of online news and stock prices.  The results of this study are as follows. (1) We confirmed that the information of the industrial sectors related to target company also contains meaningful information to predict stock movements of target company and confirmed that machine learning algorithm has better predictive power when considering the news of the relevant companies and target company’s news together. (2) It is important to predict stock movements with varying number of clusters according to the level of homogeneity in the industrial sector.

Ihak 理學 C. lixue) as its ruling ideology. The learning of principle was also called the “learning of the Way”(K. Tohak 道學 C. daoxue). While the learning of principle is a value neutral concept used to explain all things by the principle, the learning of the Way is a concept that contains the logic of regarding other theories as heterodox teachings along with the strong sense of the lineage of the Way. The learning of the Way of Chosŏn has been mostly used as a term merely referring to meanings and principles focusing on practicality(義理實踐) of the Confucian scholars, including Kim Goeng-pil and Cho Kwang-jo. As the learning of the Way was introduced during the late Koryŏ period, however, the diverse usages of the term were found and moreover, its characteristics changed over a period of time.In the late 14th century the learning of the Way was used as a term indicating Cheng-Zhu learning from the Yuan dynasty or the learning of the principle itself. The learning of the Way focused on the way of study maintaining constant inquiry and study(道問學) and regulating the world(經世實踐). Especially the characteristics stood out as the logic of regarding Buddhism and Taoism as heterodox teachings. In the 15th century, the usage of the learning of the Way also based on classical studies and focused on the way of study maintaining constant inquiry and study(道問學) and regulating the world(經世實踐). The learning of the Way based on classical studies played a role as statecraft learning or ideology for rulers as well as literati. However, as hegemonic rulers like King Sejo or Prince Yŏnsan and corrupt political forces such as old meritorious elites emerged, it came to be difficult to rectify the society only with the learning of the Way valuing the classical studies based on the explication of the classics. Hence, from the late 15th century, the learning of the Way related to cultivate oneself(節義實踐) was advocated while the learning attitudes of honoring virtuous nature(尊德性), such as controlling the mind, nourishing inner nature, and abiding in reverence, were greatly encouraged. The learning of the Way was extended to the learning of the heart-mind (K. simhak 心學 C. xinxue), which was concerned with the cultivation of mind.Above all, the key point of the learning of the Way is carrying on the orthodox lineage of the Way. Among the scholars pursuing the learning of the principle in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn it was Yi Saek who was aware of the orthodox lineage of the Way. Yi Saek claimed the authenticity of the learning of principle from Yuan dynasty by putting Xu Heng on the rank of the orthodox lineage of the Way. The arguments on the orthodox lineage of the Way in the late Koryŏ and Early Chosŏn are divided into three categories: the argument on the shrine service to Chinese Confucian scholars, on the shrine service to Korean Confucian scholars, and on the Confucian scholars who were not served in the shrines. It is remarkable to note that opinions on the orthodox lineage of the Way were swayed by the social value of the time resulted in the incessant replacement of spirit tablets in the shrines.Arguments on the lineage of the Way in the late Koryŏ and early Chosŏn are characterized by the argument on the orthodox lineage of rulers and that of Confucian scholars. The argument on the orthodox lineage of rulers was an attempt to reestablish the royal lineage by the kings of Chosŏn, which was a state of the learning of the Way. This royal lineage was considered to have ceased since Emperor Wu of the Zhou dynasty. This was exposed in the idea proposed by Chŏng To-jŏn and Park ŭi-Jung. The argument on the orthodox lineage of Confucian scholars was the assertion that, after Confucius, the Way passed down to the Chinese literati was again transmitted to the Confucian scholars of Chosŏn. ...",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

It means that North Korea declared to go “my way” without listening to any negotiation or persuasion of not only the U.S. but also China as it is facing completion of nuclear program. It is like crossing the red line and entering into the red zone. A completed different type of crises is coming. If North Korea secures the technology of miniaturizing nuclear warheads, it will be a game changer that can fundamentally change the security landscape in Northeast Asia. In the face of North Korea’s relentless provocation, concerned countries are taking it differently. U.S. President Donald Trump called North Korea’s provocation a reckless and dangerous action and warned North Korea that the U.S. would take all necessary measures to deal with it. There are continuous efforts to find practical ways to cut off source of North Korea’s funds. On the back side of such measures, President Trump is taking measures as strong as a secondary boycott to put pressure on China. As always, China keeps saying that North Korea should comply with the UN Security Council’s decisions and asking the regime to refrain from creating tension, and the concerned countries should stay calm. In front of North Korea’s provocation, China announced opposition to installation of the THAAD not hiding its purpose to bind North Korea’s provocation with the issue of installing the THAAD in the frame of the U.S.-China relationship. It shows an aspect of how China considers North Korean nuclear programs and missiles a card it can play with in the U.S.-China relationship.However, the key issue of North Korean nuclear program is getting more complicated. The U.S. and China are still arguing about how to resolve the problem of North Korean nuclear program, leading to ongoing conflict over the THAAD between South Korea and China negating the agreements between the two. In addition, the U.S. keeps requesting China to take measures super that strongly pressure North Korea including cutting oil supply to North Korea and stopping trade with it while relentlessly implying that the U.S. has been considering military attack on North Korea. South Korea, the U.S., and China has reached an agreement on the basic principle that North Korean nuclear program would never be allowed and the nuclear problem should be solved in a diplomatic way. But each country has a different approach to deal with this. The U.S. believes that it should change North Korea by putting maximum pressure on it and the South Korean administration regards this approach as a means to bring North Korea to the negotiation table, standing in line with the U.S. for the meantime. However, Chinabelieves that such a preemptive measure pressuring North Korea cannot convince it, arguing for “freeze for freeze” initiative that stops both North Korean nuclear missile tests and ROK-US Joint Military Exercise at the same time. The South Korean government is expressing its strong intension to absolutely prevent another war in the Korean peninsula against the military attack discussed by the U.S. In regards to China’s approach to the “freeze for freeze” initiative that stops both the U.S. and North Korea, South Korea has been avoiding taking China’s idea on the basis of the logic and principle that the legal ROK-US Joint Military Exercise for protecting national security cannot be exchanged with North Korea’s illegal attempt to become a nuclear power breaking the international norms.

The indirect infringement provision, after being enacted in 1973, had little difference with that of the Patent Act until the Design Protection Act included ‘export’ in the provision in 2011. This article points out what is wrong with this amendment.First of all, Article 10.28 of the Korea-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which was the basis of the 2011 amendment, is a direct infringement provision regulating the export of ‘products bearing or embodying the protected design.’ Although it may have been sufficient to include ‘export’ in the definition of ‘working’ of a design in Article 2, it seems that the Design Protection Act has been revised more than necessary to reflect the FTA agreement by adding ‘export’ as an indirect infringing act without in-depth analysis.In addition, the Supreme Court of Korea held in a patent infringement case that if a party who exports a product that has an exclusive infringing use but the product is only used abroad, the party is not liable for indirect infringement (Supreme Court Decision 2014Da42110 Decided July 23, 2015.). In view of this decision, adding ‘export’ as an indirect infringing act must be reviewed in-depth from the perspective of the territoriality. It is doubtful whether the revision was appropriate because it was not possible to find such a discussion in the National Assembly Standing Committee examination report at that time. Since there is no reason to differentiate between the Design Protection Act and the Patent Act from the perspective of the territoriality, it is necessary to remove ‘export’ from indirect infringing acts of the Design Protection Act.The indirect infringement regulations of design right are not the same between the countries. While Korea, Japan and the United States have the indirect infringement provision in the relevant Acts, there is no such provision in EU Community Design Regulation. Since relevant cases are rare, it would be doubtful whether to maintain the indirect infringement provision. However, in order to cope with the proliferation of design rights infringement by utilizing 3D printing in the future, it is necessary to figure out whether to expand the scope of object of the indirect infringement while maintaining the indirect infringement provision. Under the current provision, only ‘a product’ exclusively used for producing an article bearing or embodying the protected design is the object of the indirect infringement. Because a CAD file of an article protected by design right is not ‘a product’, the distribution of a CAD file is not an indirect infringement. Under the German and the U.K. Patent Acts, the object of the indirect infringement is not ‘a product’ but ‘a means’ which is interpreted to encompass not only physical products but also digitally processed data. It would be a solution to include ‘supplying a means exclusively used for producing an article bearing or embodying the protected design’ in the indirect infringement provision by referring to the relevant provisions of the German and the U.K. Patent Acts.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Rāma-kathā, which literally means Rāma’s story, is the phrase by which scholars refer to the basic narrative of Rāma’s marriage, exile, and battle with Rāvaṇa. The theme of Rāma-kathā is dharma which is a key concept with multiple meanings in Indian thoughts. The main plot of Rāma-kathā is Rāma’s victory over Rāvaṇa; in other words, the victory of dharma over adharma. There are several minor characters in Rāma-kathā; among them Trijaṭā is a rākṣasī on the side of dharma.In Vālmīki’s Rāmāyaṇa, Trijaṭā reprehended rākṣasīs who were threatening and frightening Sītā; she then proceeded to tell them about her dream foreshadowing the fall of Rāvaṇa and the triumph of Rāma, and made them apologize to Sītā. The other intervention of Trijaṭā takes place after the first major incident of the war. Sītā along with Trijaṭā had been sent by Rāvaṇa to view the battlefield, where Rāma lay helpless. At this sight, Sītā began to lament piteously, and Trijaṭā put heart into her assuring her that Rāma were alive.Rāma-kathā has been handed down over centuries, across regions, and among different communities, by different types of media. Several cultural/linguistic groups in India have shared this story which became a symbol of national unity and integration. Rāma-kathā has been told hundreds of times in diverse ways; its diverse set of tellings is called ‘Rāma-kathā tradition’. Trijaṭā’s characterization has been changed in later Rāma-kathās. She is generally depicted as Vibhisana’s daughter or sister. Her function and role have been enlarged; sometimes have replaced other characters’.

CPAS-K를 개발하기 위해 이론적 접근과 경험적접근을 결합하였으며, 대학생 연령을 초과하는 일반 성인들에게 CPAS-K를 활용하여 대학생들이 산출한 3가지 수준(전문가에 의해 상, 중, 하로 선정된 3가지 산물)의 창의적 산물을 평가하도록 의뢰하였다. 총 436부의 평가자료가 분석되었는데, 이 중 300부는 탐색적 구조방정식 모형(Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling)을 활용한 탐색적 요인분석에, 136부는 다특질- 다방법(multitrait-multimethod: MTMM) 접근을 활용한 확인적 요인분석에 활용되었다. 이후, 436 부의 평가자료를 모두 사용하여 다집단 분석을 실시하여 척도를 다양한 수준의 산물에 일반화하였다. 분석 결과, 일상적 영역의 문제 해결 창의성은 ‘독창성’과 ‘적절성/실용성’ 2개의 차원으로 밝혀졌고, 창의성이 높은 산물과 중간인 산물, 낮은 산물간 요인평균 비교를 통한변별이 가능하였다. 마지막으로, 연구의 의의 및 한계와 향후 제한점 등이 논의되었다.","Creativity is a competence to produce useful and novel results in uncertain environment. Creativity is an essencial factor for college students who will lead the society in the near future. In the present study we developed and validated CPAS-K(Creative Product Assessment Scale-K) to investigate college students' everyday problem solving creativity. CPAS-K was developed through theoretical and experiential approach, and validated using empirical data of three different creative products collected from 436 adults. We split the data into two sets. One set of 300 observations was analyzed by exploratory factor analysis using ESEM(exploratory structural equation modeling), and the other set of 136 observations was analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis using MTMM(Multitrait-Multimethod) approach. Then, the total data were used in a multi-group analysis. exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses yielded two factors that were interpreted as Originality and Appropriateness/Resolution. As a result of the multi-group analysis, factor means of the three products were compared. There were some differences between factor means in the Originality and the Appropriateness/Resolution dimensions so that the degree of creativity of products could be differentiated.

Feeding by the heterotrophic nanoflagellate <i>Katablepharis remigera</i> on algal prey and its nationwide distribution in Korea,2018,"['Feeding', 'Grazing', 'Growth', 'Harmful algal bloom', 'Ingestion', 'Red tide']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Heterotrophic nanoflagellates are ubiquitous in natural waters, and most heterotrophic nanoflagellates are known to grow on bacteria. Recently, the heterotrophic nanoflagellate <I>Katablepharis japonica</I> has been reported to be an effective predator of diverse toxic or harmful algal prey. To date, 7 <I>Katablepharis</I> species have been identified, and therefore important questions arise as to whether other <I>Katablepharis</I> species can feed on algal prey, and further whether the types of prey of other <I>Katablepharis</I> species differ from those of <I>K. japonica</I>. To answer these important questions, feeding by <I>Katablepharis remigera</I> on diverse algal prey was examined. Specific growth and ingestion rates of <I>K. remigera</I> feeding on the raphidophytes <I>Heterosigma akashiwo</I> and <I>Chattonella subsalsa</I> were determined. Furthermore, the abundance of <I>K. remigera</I> at 28 stations along the coastline of Korea from January 2015 to October 2017 was quantified using qPCR method and newly designed specific primer-probe sets. Among 25 potential algal prey tested, <I>K. remigera</I> fed on only <I>H. akashiwo</I> and <I>C. subsalsa</I>; however, it did not feed on a diatom, a prymnesiophyte, a prasinophyte, cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, <I>Mesodinium rubrum</I>, a mixotrophic ciliate, and another raphidophyte <I>Fibrocapsa japonica</I>. The number of prey types on which <I>K. remigera</I> could feed (2 species) was considerably smaller than that of <I>K. japonica</I> (14 species). With the increase in the mean prey concentration, the specific growth rates of <I>K. remigera</I> on <I>H. akashiwo</I> and <I>C. subsalsa</I> increased as well before becoming saturated. The maximum specific growth rates of <I>K. remigera</I> on <I>H. akashiwo</I> and <I>C. subsalsa</I> were 0.717 and 0.129 d<SUP>−1</SUP>, respectively. In addition, the maximum ingestion rates of <I>K. remigera</I> on <I>H. akashiwo</I> and <I>C. subsalsa</I> were 0.333 and 0.661 ng C predator<SUP>−1</SUP> d<SUP>−1</SUP> (3.33 and 0.23 cells predator<SUP>−1</SUP> d<SUP>−1</SUP>), respectively. The results of this study clearly indicate that <I>K. remigera</I> is an effective predator of 2 red tide-causing raphidophyte species, and additionally, the feeding activity of <I>K. remigera</I> differs greatly from that of <I>K. japonica</I>. The abundance of <I>K. remigera</I> was ≥0.1 cells mL<SUP>−1</SUP> at 24 stations located in the East, West, and South Sea of Korea. Thus, <I>K. remigera</I> has a nationwide distribution in Korea. The highest abundance of <I>K. remigera</I> in Korean waters was 24.9 cells mL<SUP>−1</SUP> in March 2017, when there was no red tide caused by <I>H. akashiwo</I> or <I>Chattonella</I> spp. In most regions where red tides caused by <I>H. akashiwo</I> or <I>Chattonella</I> spp. occurred in 2000–2017, <I>K. remigera</I> was detected.

The purpose of this paper is to examine historical change pattern and predict the long-term supply-demand for lodging rooms in Seoul. The quantitative method is based on McIntosh & Goeldner’s(1995) model, using an empirical dataset with the hotel and other accommodations from 2007 to 2016. The primary results of research are briefly summarized as follows; First, change pattern of lodging rooms are gradually imbalanced between supply-demand in Seoul, after effects on special laws enforcement(2012). Second, the outlook of supply-demand for lodging rooms was quite different by alternative simulations. According to alt 1(min) with the restricted only hotel, supply-demand for rooms are well balanced in the next three years. But at the end of 2021, supply(75K) can’t meet rising demand(80K) that additional expansion(5K) will be needed to reach an equilibrium. Consequently, it means that most of the hotel rooms will have already full at the same time. In case of alt 2(max), supported various lodging types such as guesthouse, hostel, serviced residence, supply(98K) will continue to outpace demand(80K) until 2021. The gap between supply-demand for lodging room is roughly 17K, which has sufficient to meet the high demand because of the newly built project(16K). This situation facing over-supply can cause severe damage to sales performance in operation(e.g. drop in OCC, ADR level, and revenue loss. Finally, these findings imply that adjusting or total management of supply-demand is very important to seek market stability in the future. Also it can provide a useful solution regarding mismatch problem between supply-demand as well as development the systematic forecasting model for lodging market participants(policy maker, investor, owner, operator, user).",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Most outlier detection methods calculate an outlier score that indicates the extent to which a data sample is out of normal state and determine it to be an outlier when its outlier score is above a given threshold. However, since the range of an outlier score is different for each data and the outliers exist at a smaller ratio than the normal data, it is very difficult to determine the threshold value for an outlier score. Further, in an actual situation, it is not easy to acquire data including a sufficient amount of outliers available for learning. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based outlier detection method by constructing a model representing a normal data region using only normal data and performing binary classification of outliers and normal data for new data samples. Then, by dividing the given normal data into chunks, and constructing a clustering model for each chunk, we expand it to the ensemble method combining the decision by the models and apply it to the streaming data with dynamic changes. Experimental results using real data and artificial data show high performance of the proposed method.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Various cases in other countries imply that the success of an internet-only bank depends on securing a fixed range of customers and its capability to provide them with innovative and differentiated services. Moreover, as the level of information and communication technologies and the penetration rate of mobile devices are higher than ever, alliance with ICT companies is the key element to the success of an internet-only bank.Recently the first and the second internet-only bank of Korea, K Bank and Kakao Bank, launched their businesses.

But the prospect is not bright enough. K Bank is struggling with raising capital. Their financial products are not differentiated from those of commercial banks. ICT companies cannot actively participate in operating the internet-only banks. This is partially due to applying the same regulatory scheme to internet-only banks as applied to commercial banks regardless of characteristics of internet-only banks. For the internet-only banks to overcome the limitations to which they are confronted, regulatory scheme for internet-only banks needs to be redesigned which includes alleviation of the principle of separation of financial and industrial capital for an internet-only bank and restriction of the banking activities permissible for them so that it should support the settlement and growth of internet-only banks.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

PM10 and PM2.5 was measured with quantitative concentration in 2016 on 23 urban air monitoring stations in Seoul, classified the stations into 3 groups based on the ratio of urbanized and forest land covers within a range of 3km around station, and analysed the differences in particulate matter concentration by season. The center values for the urbanized and forest land covers by group were 53.4% and 34.6% in Group A, 61.8% and 16.5% in Group B, and 76.3% and 6.7% in Group C. The group-specific concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 by season indicated that the concentration of Group A, with high ratio of forests, was the lowest in all seasons, and the concentration of Group C, with high ratio of urbanized regions, had the highest concentration from spring to autumn. These inter-group differences were statistically significant.The concentration of Group C was lower than Group B in the winter; however, the differences between Groups B to C in the winter were not statistically significant. Group A concentration compared to the high-concentration groups by season was lower by 8.5%, 11.2%, 8.0%, 6.8% for PM10 in the order of spring, summer, autumn and winter, and 3.5%, 10.0%, 4.1% and 3.3% for PM2.5.The inter-group concentration differences for both PM10 and PM2.5 were the highest in the summer and grew smaller in the winter, this was thought to be because the forests’ ability to reduce particulate matter emissions was the most pronounced during the summer and the least pronounced during the winter. The influence of urbanized areas on particulate matter concentration was lower compared to the influence of forests. This study provided evidence that the particulate matter concentration was lower for regions with higher ratios of forests, and subsequent studies are required to identify the role of green space to manage particulate matter concentration in cities.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Ru와 Co의 차세대 반도체 배선 적용성 연구,2018,"['ruthenium', 'cobalt', 'interconnects', 'resistivity size effect', 'electron mean free path']",,"Severe resistivity size effect in Cu interconnects is attributed to the relatively long bulk electron mean free path (39 nm at 298 K), which is inherently determined by phonon scattering. In this regard, Ru and Co have been recently considered as attractive alternatives for next-generation interconnect materials because the significantly shorter electron mean free paths for Ru (6.6 nm) and Co (11.8 nm) have been predicted to lead to a dramatically reduced resistivity size effect, which may allow lower resistivity of these materials than Cu at sufficiently reduced interconnect dimensions despite their relatively high bulk resistivies. In this study, the impact of surface and grain boundary scattering for Ru and Co was assessed based on the Fuchs-Sondheimer surface scattering model and the Mayadas-Shatzkes grain boundary scattering model, first by fitting these models to the resistivity data reported in the literature and second by artificially varying the scattering parameters in the models.

The intention of this paper is to investigate not only the relationship between magic and power but also to examine how power structures such as genealogy and education contribute to the formation of class divisions, biases, and social skills in childhood development. In this essay, I argue that Rowling, while sharing many of the same concerns with Althusser, is ultimately diverging from his analysis in order to suggest that through education, the means of ISAs can be overcome and that a true Bildung can be achieved. In short, I argue that blood genealogy and education becomes the main sources of power and that, while the former supports social division and prejudice against lesser beings, the latter fosters development of various social skills associated with childhood development such as logical thinking, collaboration, and valiance.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Spiral-shaped SU-8 cantilevers for monitoring mechanical response of cardiomyocytes treated with cardiac drugs,2018,"['Spiral SU-8 cantilever', 'Cardiomyocytes', 'Contraction force', 'Drug assay']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>In this paper, a spiral-shaped SU-8 cantilever with biocompatibility was proposed to monitor the changes of cardiac contraction in response to injection of drug in real time. The cantilever comprises a thick quadrate body and a filmy spiral cantilever with micro-grooves and gold patterns on the top of its surface. The longitudinally patterned micro-grooves facilitate the aligned growth of cardiomyocytes in order to increase the contraction force. In addition, the spiral shape increases the cantilever’s effective length and decreases its spring constant, which means its bending displacement can be increased for the same force as compared to that observed in a conventional rectangular cantilever. The bending displacement of the spiral SU-8 cantilever induced by the contraction of cardiomyocytes can be precisely measured at the nanoscale using a homemade laser-based measurement system. The displacement in the spiral SU-8 cantilever without micro-grooves was much greater than that in the case of traditional rectangular SU-8 cantilevers. The displacement produced by the spiral cantilever with grooves is 240% greater than that without grooves. Following preliminary experiments, cardiac drugs including Verapamil, Quinidine, Lidocaine, E-4031, and Bay K 8644 were used to evaluate their side effects on cardiomyocytes. Quantitative analysis of measurements shows that not only Verapamil and Quinidine but also Lidocaine and E-4031 treatment can decrease the cell beating frequency, and both the Verapamil and Lidocaine treatment can decrease the cell contraction force. Furthermore, Bay K 8644 assay results indicate that it can decrease the contraction force and increase the beating frequency of cardiomyocytes.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Spiral cantilever integrated with micro-grooves is proposed for a real time monitoring of cardiac contractibility. </LI> <LI>  Home-made measurement system is developed to precisely measure the contractibility of cardiomyocytes at the nanoscale. </LI> <LI>  Five different kind of drugs have been employed for the preliminary study of drug-induced cardiac toxicity. </LI> <LI>  Spiral cantilever arrays are expected to be applied as a new method to support for the drawbacks of conventional methods. </LI> </UL> </P>",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
"The TOP-SCOPE Survey of <i>Planck</i> Galactic Cold Clumps: Survey Overview and Results of an Exemplar Source, PGCC G26.53+0.17",2018,,,"<P>The low dust temperatures (< 14 K) of Planck Galactic cold clumps (PGCCs) make them ideal targets to probe the initial conditions and very early phase of star formation. 'TOP-SCOPE' is a joint survey program targeting similar to 2000 PGCCs in J = 1-0 transitions of CO isotopologues and similar to 1000 PGCCs in 850 mu m continuum emission. The objective of the 'TOP-SCOPE' survey and the joint surveys (SMT 10 m, KVN 21 m, and NRO 45 m) is to statistically study the initial conditions occurring during star formation and the evolution of molecular clouds, across a wide range of environments. The observations, data analysis, and example science cases for these surveys are introduced with an exemplar source, PGCC G26.53+0.17 (G26), which is a filamentary infrared dark cloud (IRDC). The total mass, length, and mean line mass (M/L) of the G26 filament are similar to 6200 M-circle dot, similar to 12 pc, and similar to 500 M-circle dot pc(-1), respectively. Ten massive clumps, including eight starless ones, are found along the filament. The most massive clump as a whole may still be in global collapse, while its denser part seems to be undergoing expansion owing to outflow feedback. The fragmentation in the G26 filament from cloud scale to clump scale is in agreement with gravitational fragmentation of an isothermal, nonmagnetized, and turbulent supported cylinder. A bimodal behavior in dust emissivity spectral index (beta) distribution is found in G26, suggesting grain growth along the filament. The G26 filament may be formed owing to large-scale compression flows evidenced by the temperature and velocity gradients across its natal cloud.</P>",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Dilatometric analysis and isothermal sintering of AlN-5wt% MCAS compact demonstrates that the shrinkage of the AlN specimen increases significantly above $1,300^{\circ}C$ via liquid phase sintering of MCAS additive, and complete densification could be achieved after sintering at $1,600^{\circ}C$, which is a reduction in sintering temperature by $200^{\circ}C$ compared to conventional $AlN-Y_2O_3$ systems. The MCAS glass phase is satisfactorily distributed between AlN particles after sintering at $1,600^{\circ}C$, existing as an amorphous secondary phase. The AlN specimen attained a thermal conductivity of $82.6W/m{\cdot}K$ at $1,600^{\circ}C$.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

In the present army, the radar signal is classified according to the type of threat based on the library of the radar signal parameters mostly built by the preliminary investigation. However, since radar technology is continuously evolving and diversifying, it can not properly classify signals when applying this method to new threats or threat types that do not exist in existing libraries, thus limiting the choice of appropriate jamming techniques. Therefore, it is necessary to classify the signals so that the optimal jamming technique can be selected using only the parameter data of the radar signal that is different from the method using the existing threat library. In this study, we propose a method based on machine learning to cope with new threat signal form. The method classifies the signal corresponding the new jamming method for the new threat signal by learning the classifier composed of the hidden Markov model and the neural network using the existing library data.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Thermal Characterization of Alkali Treated Kenaf Fibers and Kenaf-Epoxy Composites,2018,"['Natural fiber composites', 'Kenaf fiber treatment', 'Thermal characterization', 'TET (transient electrothermal technique)', 'SEM (scanning electron microscopy)']",,"Chemical treatment of natural fibers is a well-defined means of mechanical property improvement in natural fiberreinforced composites. An understanding of mechanical and thermal properties in these media is essential for evaluating heat transfer, thermal degradation, and overall performance of these composites over their product lifetime. However, very little information is available illustrating the effect of such treatment on the thermal properties of kenaf composites. Also, no study to date has reported the thermal conductivity of individual kenaf fibers. This study reports the effects of fiber treatment (in 6 % NaOH) on thermal transport in unidirectionally oriented kenaf-epoxy composites and individual kenaf fibers. The effective thermal conductivities and thermal diffusivities of chemically treated fiber composites show a general increase over untreated fiber composites (0.210 to 0.232 W/m/K at 28 ℃, 0.206 to 0.234 W/m/K at 200 ℃). This improvement may be attributed to improved interfacial contact between the fibers and epoxy matrix shown in microstructural images after chemical treatment. The thermal conductivity of individual fibers was evaluated at room temperature using two techniques. Results from both techniques showed slight increases after chemical treatment (0.58±0.53 to 1.0±0.13 W/m/K and 1.2±0.54 to 1.6±0.28 W/m/K) but lacked statistical significance. Any improvement in surface crystallinity after chemical treatmentdoes not appear to affect overall fiber thermal conductivity. A better understanding of thermal transport in kenaf fibers and composites enables better estimation of the performance of these composites in different applications. Moreover, the thermal conductivities of individual fibers are useful in understanding the fiber’s contribution to conduction in different fiber reinforcement configurations.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Transport Velocity of Perilla Grain on Oscillating Sieve in Elliptical Motion,2018,"['Elliptical motion', 'Four-bar linkage', 'Throwing index', 'Screening', 'Thresher sieve']",,"Purpose: The objective of this study was to propose a formula for the theoretical grain mean transport velocities of an elliptically moving oscillator by modifying the grain mean transport velocity formula applied to linear motion and to compare the calculated values with the experimental values of grain mean transport velocity. Methods: The values of the throwing index ($K_v$) and the maximum horizontal velocities for various positions on the elliptical oscillator were obtained using kinematic analysis. To obtain the actual grain transport velocity, the mean transport velocities of perilla grains at six positions on the sieve surface were measured using a high-speed camera and compared with the theoretical values. The cam with an eccentric bearing on the oscillator was designed to be eccentric by 1.6 cm so that the lengths of the major axis of the elliptical motion were 3.2-3.6 cm. The material used in the experiments was perilla grain. Results: The experimental result was consistent with the theoretical value calculated using the proposed formula ($R^2$ is 0.80). It is considered that the angle difference between the maximum accelerations in the directions vertical and horizontal to the sieve has as much influence on the grain mean transport velocity as the value of Kv itself. Conclusions: It was possible to theoretically obtain the grain mean transport velocities through a screening device in elliptical motion by modifying the formula of the grain mean transport velocities used in linear motion.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

In this prospective cohort study, 1,780 adults, free of baseline CKD with complete follow-up data, were selected from among participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study and followed for 6.3 years for development of CKD. Dietary sodium and potassium were assessed using a valid and reliable 168-item food frequency questionnaire. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation, and CKD was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 ㎡. Mean dietary intakes of sodium and potassium were 4,547±3,703 and 3,753±1,485 mg/d, respectively, and their ratio was 1.35±1.29. No significant association was found between dietary intakes of sodium and potassium and the risk of CKD after 6.3 y of followup, whereas in the case of dietary Na/K ratio, participants in the highest compared to lowest tertile (2.43 vs 1.61) had a significantly increased risk of CKD (odds ratio＝1.52, 95% confidence interval＝1.01∼2.30); an increasing trend in the risk of CKD across tertiles of dietary sodium to potassium ratio was also observed (P for trend＝0.05). Present findings demonstrate that the dietary Na/K ratio is a stronger predictor of CKD than the dietary sodium or potassium per se.

The solution models consisted of PS chains with different number of repeating units all of which were in a dilute regime. In order to investigate the compatibility between the polymer and the solvent molecules, interaction energy and Flory-Huggins (FH) interaction parameter were estimated. The simulation results indicate that increasing the chain repeating units enhanced the interaction between the solute and the solvent. Additionally, the chain dimensions were evaluated calculating the radius of gyration (Rg) and end-to-end distance, r0. To determine the dynamic behavior of the chains in the solutions, mean square displacement (MSD) and diffusivity coefficient were calculated. The simulation results indicated that the chain rigidity at low molecular weight and chain flexibility with increasing the molecular weight influenced chains dynamic behavior and diffusivity. Moreover, radial distribution function (RDF) illustrated the effect of steric hindrance of the chains in dilute solution on capturing the solvent molecules. In addition, solution viscosity was calculated by performing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation (NEMD). The obtained results of chain characteristics and viscosity showed a good agreement with experimental results published previously.

An attempt was made at Chilapatta Reserve Forest in Duars region of West Bengal to quantify its above and below ground carbon along with available “N”, “P” and “K” in the soil. Stratified random nested quadrats were marked for soil, biomass and litter sampling. Indirect or non-destructive procedures were employed for biomass estimation. The amount of these available nutrients and organic carbon quantified in soil indicates that the forest soil is high in organic carbon and available “K” and medium in phosphorus and nitrogen. The biomass, soil carbon and total carbon (soil C＋C in plant biomass) in the forest was 1,995.98, 75.83 and 973.65 Mg ha-1. More than 90% of the carbon accumulated in the forest was contributed by the trees. The annual litter production of the forest was 5.37 Mg ha-1. Carbon accumulation is intricately linked with site quality factors. The estimated biomass of 1,995.98 Mgㆍha-1 clearly indicates this. The site quality factor i.e. tropical moist deciduous with optimum availability of soil nutrients, heavy precipitation, high mean monthly relative humidity and optimum temperature range supported luxuriant growth which was realized as higher biomass accumulation and hence higher carbon accumulated.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Overexpression of TFF3 is involved in prostate carcinogenesis via blocking mitochondria-mediated apoptosis,2018,,,"The overexpression of trefoil factor family 3 (TFF3) is observed in a variety of cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa), and its potential role in carcinogenesis, such as activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, is suggested. However, its role and its related mechanisms in prostate tumorigenesis remain unknown. To elucidate the role of TFF3 overexpression in PCa, we silenced TFF3 in two PCa cell lines that overexpressed TFF3 and explored the molecular mechanism behind its antiapoptotic role. We also examined TFF3 expression in 108 Korean PCa specimens and 106 normal prostate tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. The mean TFF3 IHC score in the tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in the normal tissues (4.702 vs. 0.311, P = 2.52 × 10-24). TFF3-silenced cells showed suppressed tumor cell growth and migration. TFF3 silencing decreased BCL2 and increased BAX expression. The translocation of BAX to the mitochondria was also confirmed. After TFF3 silencing, the expression of the mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins, cytochrome C and Smac/DIABLO, was elevated, and these proteins were released from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Downstream mediators of mitochondrial apoptosis, including cleaved caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP, were also elevated. Accordingly, the proportion of apoptotic cells was significantly higher among TFF3-silenced cells.There was no difference in extrinsic apoptosis-related molecules after TFF3 silencing.

Experimental and theoretical investigation of micellization behavior of sodium dodecyl sulfate with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide in aqueous/urea solution at various temperatures,2018,"['Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS)', 'Mixed Micelle', 'Interaction Parameter', 'Activity Coefficient', 'Thermodynamic Parameter']",,"Mixed micelle formation behavior of cationic surfactant-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in aqueous as well as in urea medium from 303.15K to 323.15K at 5K interval was carried out by conductometric method. The differences between the experimental values of critical micelle concentrations (cmc) and ideal critical micelle concentrations (cmcid) illustrate the interaction between the amphiphiles studied. The values of micellar mole fraction (X1Rub (Rubingh), X1 M (Motomura), X1Rod (Rodenas) and X1 id (ideal) of surfactant CTAB determined by different proposed models and outcome indicate high involvement of CTAB in SDS-CTAB mixed micellization, which enhance by means of the augment of mole fraction of CTAB. The negative value of interaction parameter (  ) showed an attractive interaction involving CTAB and SDS. Activity coefficients were less than unity in all case, which also reveals the presence of interaction between CTAB & SDS. The negative G0 m values imply the spontaneous mixed micellization phenomenon. The attained values of H0 m were positive at inferior temperature, while negative at superior temperature. The negative H0 m values in urea (NH 2CONH2) medium illustrate exothermic micellization process. The magnitudes of S0 m were positive in almost all cases.

First It is to determine the type of letters used Seokdokgugyol(釋讀口訣) characters in this document. We use the Inwanggyeonso(仁王經疏, sutra-interpretation) to analyze the syntax related to the contents of the scriptures. And this character letter was compared with the Tripitaka Koreana. As a result, it was assumed that the text of Guyeokinwanggyeong(舊譯仁王經) was closer to the original text of Inwanggyeonso(仁王經疏, sutra-interpretation) rather than the Tripitaka Koreana version. Therefore In order to decrypt Seokdokgugyol(釋讀口訣) of the sutra tect in Guyeokinwanggyeong(舊譯仁王經), I tried to use the Inwanggyeonso(仁王經疏). In fact, I refer to the contents of Inwanggyeonso(仁王經疏) to discuss the difference between the meaning of ‘方’(方s) and ‘方’(方?) in the decoding of the Seokdokgugyol(釋讀口訣) in Guyeokinwanggyeong(舊譯仁王經). We discussed the possibility of that the meanings of the two letters are different. In addition, it is proved that gugyol letter ‘’ can be transcribed as a causative form ‘’(hʌyyə).  Second, it analyzed the form of time expressive grammatical expressions in the texts of the Seokdokgugyol(釋讀口訣) written in the Guyeokinwanggyeong(舊譯仁王經). Analyzed grammatical form from the sentences """", """", """" and """" And ‘--(-kə-)’ and ‘--(-nʌ-)’ respectively. And the function of this grammatical form is examined by analyzing the reading of the sentence. And the analysis of ‘--(-kə-)’ and ‘--(-nʌ-)’, ‘--(-nu-)’, ‘--(-no-)’ indicates that the speaker recognizes the events of ‘future’ and ‘present’.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Until now, it has been interpreted as a space of confrontation with antagonism but it is not so when we look at the narrative of the movie. Rather, it is based on ideology on the upper line, but through this space, soldiers are communicating and exchanging.

Methods: Thirty-three eyes of 33 patients with keratoconus of grade I or II and 33 eyes of 33 age- and sexmatched healthy control subjects were enrolled. Anterior, posterior, and total corneal cylinder powers and flat meridians measured by a single Scheimpflug camera were analyzed. The difference in corneal astigmatism between the simulated K and total cornea was evaluated. Results: The mean anterior, posterior, and total corneal cylinder powers of the keratoconus group (4.37 ± 1.73, 0.95 ± 0.39, and 4.36 ± 1.74 cylinder diopters [CD], respectively) were significantly greater than those of the control group (1.10 ± 0.68, 0.39 ± 0.18, and 0.97 ± 0.63 CD, respectively). The cylinder power difference between the simulated K and total cornea was positively correlated with the posterior corneal cylinder power and negatively correlated with the absolute flat meridian difference between the simulated K and total cornea in both groups. The mean magnitude of the vector difference between the astigmatism of the simulated K and total cornea of the keratoconus group (0.67 ± 0.67 CD) was significantly larger than that of the control group (0.28 ± 0.12 CD). Conclusions: Eyes with keratoconus had greater estimation errors of total corneal astigmatism based on anterior corneal measurement than did healthy eyes.

"Biomass, Primary Nutrient and Carbon Stock in a Sub-Himalayan Forest of West Bengal, India",2018,"['biomass', 'carbon storage', 'nutrient', 'litter', 'eastern himalayas']",,"Quantitative information on biomass and available nutrients are essential for developing sustainable forest management strategies to regulate atmospheric carbon. An attempt was made at Chilapatta Reserve Forest in Duars region of West Bengal to quantify its above and below ground carbon along with available ""N"", ""P"" and ""K"" in the soil. Stratified random nested quadrats were marked for soil, biomass and litter sampling. Indirect or non-destructive procedures were employed for biomass estimation. The amount of these available nutrients and organic carbon quantified in soil indicates that the forest soil is high in organic carbon and available ""K"" and medium in phosphorus and nitrogen. The biomass, soil carbon and total carbon (soil C＋C in plant biomass) in the forest was 1,995.98, 75.83 and $973.65Mg\;ha^{-1}$. More than 90% of the carbon accumulated in the forest was contributed by the trees. The annual litter production of the forest was $5.37Mg\;ha^{-1}$. Carbon accumulation is intricately linked with site quality factors. The estimated biomass of $1,995.98Mg{\cdot}ha^{-1}$ clearly indicates this. The site quality factor i.e. tropical moist deciduous with optimum availability of soil nutrients, heavy precipitation, high mean monthly relative humidity and optimum temperature range supported luxuriant growth which was realized as higher biomass accumulation and hence higher carbon accumulated.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

That Rebecca refuses to “start again” does not necessarily mean that she has the power to end once and for all. What she is really interested in is ending “again and again and again,” which means that she can take the subject position of a victim as well as other subject positions whenever and if necessary.

The questionnaire is intended to elicit information from each patient regarding the quality of recovery during the postoperative period. It is noteworthy, however, that an official Korean version of the QoR-40 (QoR- 40K) has not been established. The purpose of this study was to develop the QoR-40K by translation and cultural adaptation process and to evaluate the validity and reliability of the QoR-40K.Methods: After pre-authorization from the original author of the QoR-40, the translation procedure was established and carried out based upon Beaton’s recommendation to create a QoR-40K model comparable to the original English QoR- 40. Two hundred surgical patients were enrolled, and each completed the questionnaire during the preoperative period, on the third day, and 1 month after surgery. The QoR-40K was compared with the visual analogue scale (VAS) and another health-related questionnaire, the Short-form Health Survery-36 (SF-36). The method of validation for QoR-40K included test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and level of responsiveness.Results: Spearman’s correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.895 (P < 0.001), and Cronbach’s alpha of the global QoR-40K on the third day after surgery was 0.956. A positive correlation was obtained between the QoR-40K and the mental component summary of SF-36 (ρ = 0.474, P < 0.001), and a negative correlation was observed between QoR- 40K and VAS (ρ = −0.341, P < 0.001). The standardized responsive mean of the total QoR-40K was 0.71.Conclusions: The QoR-40K was found to be as acceptable and reliable as the original English QoR-40 for Korean patients after surgery, despite the apparent differences in the respective patients’ cultural backgrounds.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

This means that the higher the concentration of residual chlorine in tap water, the higher the corrosion rate of pipe materials. When calcium hydroxide was added to tap water, the corrosiveness index was improved and thus the corrosion rate reduced. It is possible to increase the disinfection efficiency by increasing the duration of residual chlorine and suppressing the rust generation of water pipes and to supply minerals. A guideline for corrosion control with residual chlorine should be set up. The effects of residual chlorine should be included in the corrosiveness index of tap water.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Study on the Thermionic-Emission-Type Cs-Ion Source,2018,"['Thermionic emission', 'Cs$^+$ ion', '$', 'beta$-eucryptite', 'Decay constant']",,"A thermionic-emission-type Cs$^+$-ion source based on a $\beta$-eucryptite-like material was fabricated, and its emission characteristics were investigated. The results obtained by using a residual gas analyzer showed that the material had a small amount of outgassing in an ultra-high vacuum even at high source temperature. The estimated Cs$^+$ ion emission energy was 4.03 eV, meaning that Cs$^+$ ions could be easily emitted. The current density at the source surface was 0.46 A/m$^2$ $\sim$ 48 A/m$^2$, the temperature was 1173 K $\sim$ 1373 K, and the filament potential was 300 V. The halflives of this specimen were 2.31 $\times$ 10$^3$ min, 1.98 $\times$ 10$^2$ min and 2.77 $\times$ 10 min for filament temperatures of 1173 K, 1273 K and 1373 K, respectively, meaning that this material has a very long lifetime. The estimated decay time constant function is very useful for determining the ion beam current or the total dose in an ion implantation study. In conclusion, these results can be applied to various research fields, such as depth profiling and secondary-ion mass spectroscopy, and can be used to construct Cs$^+$ emitting devices with a simple structure.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Effect of Homogenization Pressure and Supplementation with Sucrose Fatty Acid Ester on the Physical Properties of Dairy Cream-based Emulsions,2018,"['dairy cream emulsion', 'sucrose fatty acid ester', 'droplet size distribution', 'rheological properties', 'stability']",,"In this study, the droplet size distribution, rheological properties, and stability of dairy cream-based emulsions homogenized with different sucrose fatty acid ester (SFAE, a non-ionic small-molecule emulsifier) concentrations (0.08%, 0.16%, and 0.24% w/w) at different homogenization pressures (10 MPa and 20 MPa) were examined. Homogenization at a high pressure resulted in a smaller droplet size and narrower droplet size distribution. The D[4,3] (volume-weighted mean) and D[3,2] (surface-weighted mean) values of the emulsions decreased with an increase in the SFAE concentration. The flow properties of the emulsions homogenized with SFAE showed shear-thinning (n=0.21-0.46) behavior. The apparent viscosity (ηa,10) and consistency index (K) of the homogenized emulsions were lower than those of the control sample that is non-homogenized and without SFAE, and decreased with an increase in SFAE concentration. The storage modulus (G ) and loss modulus (G ) of all emulsions homogenized with SFAE were also lower than those of the control sample. The stability of all emulsions with SFAE did not show any significant change for 30 d at 5℃. However, the emulsions stored at 40℃ were unstable over the storage period. Therefore, the addition of SFAE enhanced the stability of dairy cream emulsions during storage at refrigeration temperature (5℃).",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

This novel has been regarded as a Gordian Knot in the field of Yi Sang’s literature. Though he looks like a patient suffering from schizophrenia because of the abnormal expressions in “The Dark Room of the Map”, he thoroughly intend to show a certain message. Thus, three characters(‘I’, Lee-sang, ‘K’) in the work doesn’t mean the crack of writer consciousness and it cannot be treated as the part of schizophrenia. Yi Sang designed three characters but they are actually the one. When we interpret this, we need to consider ‘Theory of Trinity’ in Christianity. It is because Yi Sang drew Jesus Christ’s image into his other literary works. The reason is associated with his poor growth environment. Yi Sang(Kim, Hae-gyeong) had to support his biological father, Young-chang who made Yi Sang adopted to Young-chang’s elder brother.

Although the major elements differ among different samples, their low mean chemical index of alteration mean CIA = 51.04–64.79), plagioclase index of alteration (mean PIA = 51.41–69.54), and relatively high mean index of compositional variability (mean ICV = 1.18–1.56) indicate relatively low maturity and weak to moderate chemical weathering of their source. The Zr/Sc-Th/Sc diagram and relatively high mean ICV suggest that all sediments of Zongwulong Group have undergone no significant sediment recycling. All samples yield relatively high Al2O3/TiO2 ratios (16–27), strong LREE/HREE differentiation (mean LaN/YbN = 10.83–12.66), and obvious negative Eu anomalies (mean Eu/Eu* = 0.61–0.79).

Currently, arobust Chinese cymbidium classification system, such as that based on cytotaxonomy, is lacking. To investigate the geneticvariation within Chinese cymbidium, we selected 28 individual Chinese cymbidium cultivars as experimental materialto perform karyotype analysis. The results showed that chromosome number among these 28 cultivars was constant anddiploid (i.e., 2n = 40). In addition, no satellite chromosomes were observed. The karyotypes were more symmetrical andconsisted mainly of 1B and 2B types with a small number of 2A and 2C types. Based on principal component analysis, thefive karyotype parameters with the highest classification values were screened, which revealed that the mean of long to shortarm ratio, the mean relative length of long arms, and the asymmetry coefficient of karyotypes (As.K.) were reliable parametersfor use in Chinese cymbidium cytotaxonomy. Cluster analysis of karyotype parameters successfully identified cultivarsof the bamboo petal, narcissus petal, and plum petal types, thus confirming the accuracy of the cytological classificationsystem.

Secondary endpoints were changes in the Nepean Dyspepsia Index-Korean version (NDI-K), rate of satisfactory symptom relief, and rate of adverse events. Results: A total of 138 patients were enrolled (female, 73.9%; mean age, 44.0±15.4 years). After excluding patients who violated the study protocol, 59 and 58 patients from the study and control groups, respectively, were included in the per-protocol analysis. No difference was observed in drug compliance between the control and study groups (97.07%±4.52% vs 96.85%±6.05%, p=0.870). Changes in GIS scores were -9.69±6.44 and -10.01±5.92 in the study and control groups. The mean difference in GIS change between groups was 0.33 (95% confidence interval, -1.75 to 2.41), demonstrating non-inferiority of UI-05MSP015CT (p=0.755). The rate of satisfactory symptom relief was not different between the study and control groups (39.0% vs 56.9%, p=0.053). No differences in change in NDI-K score (14.3 vs 16.9, p=0.263) or rates of adverse events (12.9% vs. 4.4%, p=0.062) were observed between the study and control groups. Conclusions: Once-daily mosapride is not inferior to conventional mosapride in efficacy and is safe in patients with FD. (Gut Liver 2018;12:516-522)",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
A Constructional Analysis of Old English Nominal Compounds,2018,"['Old English nominal compounds', 'Construction Morphology', 'word-formation']",,"Analysis of Old English Compounds. English Language and Linguistics 24.3, 1-45. This study provides a constructional analysis of Old English (OE) nominal (N) compounds (8,034 in total) based on the theoretical framework of Construction Morphology (Booij 2010c). A constructional analysis gives the solution to overcome the limitation of a traditional descriptive analysis, which makes a dichotomous classification, ‘Endocentric’ and ‘Exocentric’. This study mainly shows two things. First, OE N compounds are seen as constructions with form and meaning, and hence the formal and semantic properties of both regular and idiosyncratic N compounds can be simply and straightforwardly specified by abstract schemas (templates). Second, with the notion of ‘Default Inheritance’, this study demonstrates that both schemas for regular and idiosyncratic N compounds inherit the default properties from the most abstract schema for OE N compounds ([[X] k [N] i ] Nj ↔ [SEM i with relation R to SEM k ] j ) at the top of the hierarchy: a default override of idiosyncratic compounds is allowed. As a result, a classification of OE N compounds can be made in a unified and simple way with an inheritance tree.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Development of Efficient Strategy for Square Peg-in-Hole Assembly Task,2018,"['Robotic assembly', 'Square peg-in-hole task', 'Error recovery', 'Blind search', 'Clustering algorithm']",,"In this paper, we present a dexterous gripper with an angle measurement system and efficient strategy for estimating a hole position from reaction force measurements in a square peg-in-hole task. The contact conditions between a square peg and hole have been analyzed to show that the redundancy in reaction force-moment relation around hole originated from contact conditions. In order to remove such redundancy in contact conditions, an angular error between a square peg and hole is first corrected with the help of the angle measurement system. Then, the positional error between them is identified by applying two clustering algorithms (K means algorithm and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm) to the reaction moment data obtained by the XY search. For grasping and manipulating a peg precisely, a 4-DOF dexterous gripper is designed, which consists of two fingers equipped with 6-axis force/torque sensor at fingertip. The extensive experiments using the proposed gripper with the angle measurement system demonstrate that during the square peg-in-hole task, the proposed strategy ensures the tact time of around 5 sec with the estimation accuracy of less than 0.35 mm and the deviation of less than 0.44 mm, respectively.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

In this article, I will review the achievement of corporation management in North Korea based on the financial materials of Pyeonghwa Motors and suggest a strategy for progressive economic cooperation.As you know, private property of production means are not allowed at all in North Korea. Neither do businesses belong to individuals. Pyeonghwa Motors entered market in the early stages of this cooperation project. Many experts consider Pyeonghwa Motors’ management as a pilot business activity in North Korea which controls all economic factors and business through the planned economy. Of course, there were also some challenges. Party committee of N.K limits major decisions of corporate management such as employment and wages while interfering in management. Especially, the company could not maximize its expected profit by forcing the company to keep the unit price at its lowest level.Definitely, there are two sides in the condition that North Korean authorities’ intervention. North Korea applied tax burden of corporate very flexibly. Even though Pyeonghwa Motors started paying after the initial three year exemption period, but it has been applied a variety of preferred policies. It is the result of the Pyeonghwa Motors’ strategy that not only it entered the market of N.K’s preferred industries, also continued close cooperation with the authorities. In addition, there is a part of the cornerstone for development by getting exceptional consideration in selecting sites. There have been unusual experiments such as advertisement of corporate products for the first time in North Korea.However, North Korea on planned economy should ease the regulations to sustainable development. It is necessary to ensure the autonomy of management to maximize the effectiveness of corporate management and increase its expected profit.

Performance Prediction of a Laser-guide Star Adaptive Optics System for a 1.6 m Telescope,2018,"['Adaptive optics', 'Atmospheric turbulence', 'Telescope', 'Strehl ratio']",,"We are currently investigating the feasibility of a 1.6 m telescope with a laser-guide star adaptive optics (AO) system. The telescope, if successfully commissioned, would be the first dedicated adaptive optics observatory in South Korea. The 1.6 m telescope is an f/13.6 Cassegrain telescope with a focal length of 21.7 m. This paper first reviews atmospheric seeing conditions measured over a year in 2014~2015 at the Bohyun Observatory, South Korea, which corresponds to an area from 11.6 to 21.6 cm within 95% probability with regard to the Fried parameter of 880 nm at a telescope pupil plane. We then derive principal seeing conditions such as the Fried parameter and Greenwood frequency for eight astronomical spectral bands (V/R/I/J/H/K/L/M centered at 0.55, 0.64, 0.79, 1.22, 1.65, 2.20, 3.55, and 4.77 μm). Then we propose an AO system with a laser guide star for the 1.6 m telescope based on the seeing conditions. The proposed AO system consists of a fast tip/tilt secondary mirror, a 17 × 17 deformable mirror, a 16 × 16 Shack-Hartmann sensor, and a sodium laser guide star (589.2 nm). The high order AO system is close-looped with 2 KHz sampling frequency while the tip/tilt mirror is independently close-looped with 63 Hz sampling frequency. The AO system has three operational concepts: 1) bright target observation with its own wavefront sensing, 2) less bright star observation with wavefront sensing from another bright natural guide star (NGS), and 3) faint target observation with tip/tilt sensing from a bright natural guide star and wavefront sensing from a laser guide star. We name these three concepts ‘None’, ‘NGS only’, and ‘LGS + NGS’, respectively. Following a thorough investigation into the error sources of the AO system, we predict the root mean square (RMS) wavefront error of the system and its corresponding Strehl ratio over nine analysis cases over the worst (2σ) seeing conditions. From the analysis, we expect Strehl ratio >0.3 in most seeing conditions with guide stars.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
"Raman Lidar for the Measurement of Temperature, Water Vapor, and Aerosol in Beijing in the Winter of 2014",2018,"['Lidar', 'Rotational Raman', 'Temperature', 'Water vapor', 'Aerosol']",,"To measure atmospheric temperature, water vapor, and aerosol simultaneously, an efficient multi-function Raman lidar using an ultraviolet-wavelength laser has been developed. A high-performance spectroscopic box that utilizes multicavity interference filters, mounted sequentially at small angles of incidence, is used to separate the lidar return signals at different wavelengths, and to extract the signals with high efficiency. The external experiments are carried out for simultaneous detection of atmospheric temperature, water vapor, and aerosol extinction coefficient in Beijing, under clear and hazy weather conditions. The vertical profiles of temperature, water vapor, and aerosol extinction coefficient are analyzed. The results show that for an integration time of 5 min and laser energy of 200 mJ, the mean deviation between measurements obtained by lidar and radiosonde is small, and the overall trend is similar. The statistical temperature error for nighttime is below 1 K up to a height of 6.2 km under clear weather conditions, and up to a height of 2.5 km under slightly hazy weather conditions, with 5 min of observation time. An effective range for simultaneous detection of temperature and water vapor of up to 10 km is achieved. The temperature-inversion layer is found in the low troposphere. Continuous observations verify the reliability of Raman lidar to achieve real-time measurement of atmospheric parameters in the troposphere.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

This study points to wide-spread consumer harm cases such as mis-selling scandals of debt-cancellation-debt-suspention products and ‘cardsurance’ sales by credit card companies where financial companies mis-sold financial products to consumers by misrepresenting the terms and conditions of such products. While we expect the uprise of similar cases of widespread consumer harm in the future, existing current law is ill-suited to amend these types of harm because they are limited to cumbersome and time–consuming means such as litigation and financial dispute resolution systems. Furthermore, (unlike certain foreign jurisdictions studied in this case study) Korean national laws lack the explicit legal grounds to mandate financial companies to reimburse consumers in cases of widespread consumer harm. Widespread mis-selling is not a phenomenon exclusive to Korea. In the United States, widespread mis-selling of credit card add-on products called the attention of the CFPB, while in the United Kingdom, mis-selling of payment protection insurance has also caused the FSA/FCA to perform drastic measures for consumer redress of these products. Notably, in these two nations consumer redress in cases of widepspread financial harm are done efficiently and effectively. Financial companies were required by their financial authorities to reimburse directly to the consumers of the financial harm caused by mis-selling (in the U.S. by way of consent order), or to notify their consumers of the possibility of financial harm caused by mis-selling (in the U.K. by way of PPI consumer redress schemes).Most importantly, in the U.S. and the U.K., consumer redress schemes are imposed and operated by explicit legal mandates, guidelines and procedures promulgated by financial authorities, and are closely supervised by financial authorities. This paper argues that the Financial Consumer Protection Bill which is submitted to the Korean legislature should include new provisions on consumer-friendly consumer redress schemes which are modeled after these foreign examples.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Mesozoic magmatism in the eastern North China Craton: Insights on tectonic cycles associated with progressive craton destruction,2018,"['Petrology', 'Geochemistry', 'Zircon U-Pb geochronology and Lu-Hf isotopes', 'Mesozoic magmatism', 'North China Craton']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The North China Craton (NCC) provides a classic example for lithospheric thinning associated with craton destruction (or decratonization) through multiple tectonic events. The peak of craton destruction is considered to have occurred during Mesozoic, especially in Early Cretaceous, linked to the subduction/collision between the NCC and Yangtze Craton during the Triassic in the south and the Paleo-Pacific plate subduction during Early Cretaceous in the east. Here we investigate a suite of intrusive and volcanic suites including granite, gabbro, diorite, basalt, andesite, volcanic tuff, agglomerate, siliceous tuff and trachyte from the southern Yishui and Juxian domains to gain insights into the Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the eastern NCC in relation to decratonization. Zircon U-Pb data from basalt show multiple populations with xenocrystic grains ranging in age from Paleoproterozoic (2457–1940 Ma), through Neoproterozoic (896–559 Ma), to Paleozoic (442–380 Ma) and Mesozoic (204–122 Ma). Inherited grains from the granite and gabbro yield weight mean <SUP>206</SUP>Pb/<SUP>238</SUP>U ages of 650.0 ± 13 to 773.4 ± 2.6 Ma suggesting the involvement of components from the Yangtze Craton. Magmatic zircons from diorite show weight mean <SUP>206</SUP>Pb/<SUP>238</SUP>U ages of 121.5 ± 1.2 Ma representing the emplacement age of this rock. Magmatic zircon grains from the volcanic suite (andesite, volcanic tuff, agglomerate, siliceous tuff and trachyte), show weighted mean <SUP>206</SUP>Pb/<SUP>238</SUP>U ages of 132.4 ± 1.4 Ma, 123.02 ± 0.71 Ma, 122.97 ± 0.69 Ma, 121.96 ± 0.49 Ma, and 124.6 ± 1.1 Ma respectively, corresponding to the timings of their eruption. The Paleoproterozoic zircon grains correspond to xenocrysts captured from the NCC basement rocks, whereas the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic grains were inherited from the Yangtze Craton. The Late Triassic to Jurassic zircon grains can be correlated to delamination of the thickened continental crust during deep subduction of Yangtze continental crust and the continent-continent collision between NCC and the Yangtze Craton. The Early Cretaceous population can be linked to the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate from the east and related extensional setting. The geochemical data display significant enrichment in LREE along with negative Eu anomalies, with high Th/Ta and La/Nb ratios, negative Nb–Ta anomalies, and high concentration of LILE (K, Rb, Ba and Pb) than HFSE (Nb, Ta and Ti), suggesting subduction-related arc magmatic setting in an active continental margin. Zircon Lu-Hf data from these rocks display dominantly negative εHf(t) values ranging from −36.8 to −3.1, T<SUB>DM</SUB> in the range of 1105–2572 Ma, and T<SUB>DM</SUB> <SUP>C</SUP> between 1785 Ma and 3776 Ma, indicating that the magma sources involved Paleoproterozoic components with minor input of reworked Archean crust through different degrees of enrichment with crustal material and minor input from extension-related mantle melting. In conjunction with the results from previous studies in the eastern NCC, we propose that the late Paleozoic southward subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, the Triassic northward subduction and collision of the Yangtze Craton with the NCC, and the Early Cretaceous westward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate jointly contributed to the cratonic destruction of NCC. The Paleo-Pacific plate subduction beneath the NCC (major contributing mechanism) with the slab rollback induced lithospheric extension likely facilitated back-arc spreading, asthenospheric upwelling resulting in lithospheric thinning including delamination, melting of lithosphere mantle, and underplating of the modified mantle beneath the lower crust of the NCC during the Early Cretaceous.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Early Cretaceous magmatic suite from the eastern NCC",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The following conclusions were drawn.  (1) Word-final Nasals in Language A of Early Old Chinese changed to Vowel u · i · ∅ in Language B of Middle Old Chinese.  (2) Early Old Chinese had closed syllables, for example, CɑC and C1C2ɑC1C2. The syllable C1C2ɑC1C2 in Early Old Chinese changed to an open syllable, such as C1ɑ∅ · u · i or C2ɑ∅ · u · i in Middle Old Chinese. Therefore, the initial a double consonant can be reconstructed easily, but athe final double consonant waiss difficult to reconstruct.  (3) In Language AB in Middle Old Chinese, which was formed through a contact between Language A and Language B, there existed many sub-language groups such as AB1(C)→AB2(Q・N)→AB3(t · k · n · ŋ)→AB4(p · t · k · m · n · ŋ), according to the word-final consonant. This is also observed in changes in word-final consonants form Ancient Chinese to Modern Chinese as well as in Chinese dialects.  (4) Early Old Chinese had closed syllables wherein many consonants continued, such as CɑC or C1C2ɑC1C2 or C1C2C3ɑC1C2C3. These syllable structures suggest that meant Early Old Chinese was influenced by asome language that was dissimilar tohad totally different syllable structures from Chinese .  (5) It is necessary to further study many Altaic languages around China and Old Korean in order to clarify the double consonant syllable system in Early Old Chinese.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

However, since cross-border working of a patented invention is increasing due to the globalization and internationl networking, it is difficult to determine the country where the patented invention is being worked (whether it is the location of the server, the location of the terminal receiving the service, or the location of the service provider).First of all, the interpretation that patent infringement does not exist unless all elements of a patented invention (a product or a process) are physically present in the country is not inevitably derived from the principle of territoriality. In addition, according to the case law of the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, even where the patented system or method is partly worked abroad, it may still constitute patent infringement. Furthermore, it is necessary to cope with the cross-border patent infringement situation that is frequent in the digital and network technology environment. Thus, the possibility and necessity of flexible interpretation of territoriality can be recognized.Next, in relation to the flexible interpretation of territoriality, it would be a solution to determine the place of patent infringement based on where the ‘main act’ has been performed. The ‘main act’ test has an affinity with the patent law system and the specific requirements of the test can be established by accumulation of cases. When determining where the ‘main act’ has been performed, it is necessary to comprehensively consider factors such as (i) the physical location of the decision maker of the working and (ii) the place where the technical effect of a patented invention is realized. This test, which is similar to the ‘control and beneficial use’ criteria set out in the US case law, should be applied equally regardless of the category of the invention, whether it is a system claim or a method claim.By the way, in case of network related inventions, profit is usually generated through ‘use’ of the system rather than through manufacture and sale of the system. In addition, many network related inventions are claimed as processes. Therefore, the working act of ‘use’ is more important than before when determining patent infringement. In these situations, it is necessary to interpret the meaning of ‘use’ of the product or process, not formally but normatively. Furthermore, if it is not sufficient to cope with cross-border patent infringement with these interpretations, it will be necessary to amend the provisions of infringing act to incorporate the specially adapted infringing act in relation to network-related inventions.Finally, in case of cross-border working of a patented invention carried out by a plurality of actors, both the issue of divided infringement and the issue of territoriality matter. In this situation, it should first be determined whether the infringing act has been committed in this country or not and, if so, it should then be determined who among the plurality of actors is responsible for the infringing act.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
A Novel MEMS Microheater Based Alcohol Gas Sensor using Nanoparticles,2018,"['Thin film MEMS', 'titanium dioxide', 'polysilicon', 'micro-heater']",,"This work reports the simulation of nanoparticle coated MEMS based Alcohol Gas Sensor analysis with various parameters like power consumption, temperature uniformity, resistance change, sensitivity and selectivity. It is achieved by measuring the change in resistance when gas is exposed over the sensing layer.

The sensor holds a very thin conducting film made of titanium which detects the presence of ethyl alcohol vapors on it. The temperature generated by the hot-plate influences various factors such as the conductance of the film and the quantity of a particular gas adsorbed on it. When sensor film is bring to the right boiling point temperature it evaporates residual vapor particles. For effective sensing of alcohol gas, we optimize the supply voltage (around 3 Volts) and the uniform temperature profile of the micro heater was analyzed (619.29 K) along with sensitivity and selectivity.

Read-out IC (ROIC) implements infrared signal detection and offset correction for fixed pattern noise (FPN) using an internal digital to analog convertor (DAC) value control function. A reliable WLVP thermal sensor was obtained with the design of lid wafer, the formation of Au80%wtSn20% eutectic solder, outgassing control and wafer to wafer bonding condition. The measurement of thermal conductance enables us to inspect the internal atmosphere condition of WLVP microbolometer sensor. The difference between the measurement value and design one is 3.6×10-9 [W/K] which indicates that thermal loss is mainly on account of floating legs. The mean time to failure (MTTF) of a WLVP thermal sensor is estimated to be about 10.2 years with a confidence level of 95 %.

However, the intensive development of 3D computer vision in recent years has brought more potential research opportunities in pose-based action detection and recognition. Thanks to the advantages of depth camera devices like the Microsoft Kinect sensor, we developed an effective approach to in-depth analysis of indoor actions using skeleton information, in which skeleton-based feature extraction and topic model-based learning are two major contributions. Geometric features, i.e. joint distance, joint angle, and joint-plane distance are calculated in the spatio-temporal dimension. These features are merged into two types, called pose and transition features, and then are provided to codebook construction to convert sparse features into visual words by <I>k</I>-means clustering. An efficient hierarchical model is developed to describe the full correlation of feature - poselet - action based on Pachinko Allocation Model. This model has the potential to uncover more hidden poselets, which have been recognized as the valuable information and help to differentiate pose-sharing actions. The experimental results on several well-known datasets, such as MSR Action 3D, MSR Daily Activity 3D, Florence 3D Action, UTKinect-Action 3D, and NTU RGB+D Action Recognition, demonstrate the high recognition accuracy of the proposed method.

The guilt and shame of the survivors was the driving force of the literary representation and testimony which continued from the short story 「Spring Day」 to the long story 『Spring day』. Therefore, after the 『Spring day』, Lim Chul-woo should have been able to escape from the historical crush. However, repetitive writing could not express the impatience of shame and shame left by the subject. 『One hundred years inn』 was requested when the reappearance could not be reached. 『One hundred years inn』 is not the writing of the representation and testimony but the ethical writing which keeps on looking back the subject continuously is the place of literature after the incident.For this purpose, this study focused on the relationship between ‘K’ and ‘you’ in the works. ‘K’ (Park Hyo-sun) calls three times to ‘You’, the speaker of the work on May 18. It was a summons of alive Kay. However, when you ignore ‘K’, the embarrassment and embarrassment of the self is born. The attempt to express this was the driving force of repetitive writing. However, the conversation with ‘Seonok’ makes us realize that self - compassion - centered self - writing does not allow us to look into the pain and sorrow of our neighbor. When I reached an ethical point of view that I was insensitive to the suffering of a neighboring neighbor through the continuous action of ‘I - look back’, a 『One hundred years inn』could be used. And this ‘me - look back’ act together with 5·18 provide the grounds to summon those who can not speak like the 4·3 Jeju events, the Korean War, and the wars of the Vietnam War to the island of Youngdo.Based on this analysis, this essay analyzed the existence of ‘K’ on three layers, interpreted it as a representation of each other by Lim Chul - woo and tried to reveal that each method of writing is different. The first ‘K’ represents the self, called Lim Chul-woo, who feels guilty and shame as being out of the eavesdropping. The writing of self-confessions corresponds to this. The second ‘K’ represents the self, called Lim Chul-woo, who attempts to reproduce Gwangju through literature as a testament to the truth of May Gwangju. Reproduction and writing of testimony correspond to this. The last ‘K’ is a voice calling ‘You’ from ‘Youngdo’ after death. It makes you listen to the suffering and groaning of the other person. It was the most powerful way to constantly summon the event to reality, as it was beyond the realistic language and the reappearance could not reach it, as if it were ‘apples-to-be’ writing, which conveys the stories of the ghosts like ‘applause shaman.’ In this study, I would like to present the conclusion that it is the writing method of Lim Chul - woo, who continuously makes the meaning of May - Gwangju as the ‘writing of the other-being’.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv
Comparison of removal torques between laser-etched and modified sandblasted acid-etched Ti implant surfaces in rabbit tibias,2018,"['Sandblasted large-grit acid-etched', 'Laser treatment', 'Removal torque', 'Scanning electron microscope', 'Energy dispersive spectroscopy']",,"PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of two different implant surface treatments on initial bone connection by comparing the Removal Torque Values (RTQs) at 7 and 10 days after chemically modified, sandblasted, large-grit and acid-etched (modSLA), and Laser-etched (LE) Ti implant placements. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Twenty modSLA and 20 LE implants were installed on the left and right tibias of 20 adult rabbits. RTQs were measured after 7 and 10 days in 10 rabbits each. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs of the two implants were observed by using Quanta FEG 650 from the FEI company (Hillsboro, OR, USA). Analyses of surface elements and components were conducted using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Horiba, Kyoto, Japan). RESULTS. The mean RTQs were $12.29{\pm}0.830$ and $12.19{\pm}0.713$ Ncm after 7 days (P=.928) and $16.47{\pm}1.324$ and $16.17{\pm}1.165$ Ncm after 10 days (P=.867) for LE and modSLA, respectively, indicating no significant inter-group differences. Pore sizes in the LE were $40{\mu}m$ and consisted of numerous small pores, whereas pore sizes in the modSLA were $5{\mu}m$. In the EDS analysis, Ti, O, and C were the only three elements found in the LE surfaces. Na, Ca, Cl, and K were also observed in modSLA, in addition to Ti, O, and C. CONCLUSION. The implants showed no significant difference in biomechanical bond strength to bone in early-stage osseointegration. LE implant can be considered an excellent surface treatment method in addition to the modSLA implant and can be applied to the early loading of the prosthesis clinically.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

By virtue of 5.18 Uprising and the 1987 June Democracy Movement eventually made it possible for Korea to have a transition to democracy without any bloody situation. Advisory Committee on the Special Committee on the Constitution’s final report during the last year had included 6.10 Movement in addition to the 4.19 revolution in the preamble to the constitution. Even President Moon Jae-in had pledged an inclusion of 5.18 spirit into the preamble to the constitution, but it unfortunately did not happen. The reasons or this failure included regional limitation and the lack of a local outlook of historical assessment.However, the 5.18 Uprising had historical assessment by the supreme court with 1997’s judgement that it was a justifiable civic movement for depending the constitutional orders and values. Furthermore, in 1997, the Korean government made the day of May 18th an official national holiday. In 2002, an enactment of a new Act honored people who related to 5.18 Uprising persons of national merit. Also, 5.18’s regional limitations pointed out that the unleash of a pro-democracy movement after 1979’s 10.26. As such, 5.18 can’t be evaluated with Gwangju region’s limited subject The reason why 5.18 Uprising couldn’t spread to the whole country was because of the military influence as a result of the 12.12 military coup.

This study points to wide-spread consumer harm cases such as mis-selling scandals of debt-cancellation-debt-suspention products and ‘cardsurance’ sales by credit card companies where financial companies mis-sold financial products to consumers by misrepresenting the terms and conditions of such products. While we expect the uprise of similar cases of widespread consumer harm in the future, existing current law is ill-suited to amend these types of harm because they are limited to cumbersome and time –consuming means such as litigation and financial dispute resolution systems. Furthermore, (unlike certain foreign jurisdictions studied in this case study) Korean national laws lack the explicit legal grounds to mandate financial companies to reimburse consumers in cases of widespread consumer harm. Widespread mis-selling is not a phenomenon exclusive to Korea. In the United States, widespread mis-selling of credit card add-on products called the attention of the CFPB, while in the United Kingdom, mis-selling of payment protection insurance has also caused the FSA/FCA to perform drastic measures for consumer redress of these products. Notably, in these two nations consumer redress in cases of widepspread financial harm are done efficiently and effectively. Financial companies were required by their financial authorities to reimburse directly to the consumers of the financial harm caused by mis-selling (in the U.S. by way of consent order), or to notify their consumers of the possibility of financial harm caused by mis-selling (in the U.K. by way of PPI consumer redress schemes).  Most importantly, in the U.S. and the U.K., consumer redress schemes are imposed and operated by explicit legal mandates, guidelines and procedures promulgated by financial authorities, and are closely supervised by financial authorities. This paper argues that the Financial Consumer Protection Bill which is submitted to the Korean legislature should include new provisions on consumer-friendly consumer redress schemes which are modeled after these foreign examples.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Plant height, number of leaves/plant, number of branches/plant, shoot biomass, total dry matter, number of nodules/plant, weight of pod, number of seeds/pod, seed weight/pod and grain yield varied amongst the genotypes and across the different planting dates in both years. The association between grain yield and other variables analysed across both years was significant and positive except 100-seed weight and the phenological characters of the plant. Path coefficients analysis across two years indicated that seed weight/pod followed by number of branches/plant and number of seeds/pod had positive direct effect on grain yield of cowpea in contrast to characters that exhibited negative but direct effect on yield. The other traits had relatively negligible to low indirect effects that were positive through other component traits.

For that reason, the administrative laws and concerned ordinances have a variety of administrative means like administrative penalties, administrative enforcement and administrative immediate enforcement and so on. Among these means, the administrative penalties refers to “he punishment imposed by the state or the local government as a sanction based on the administrative law against those who break down the administrative laws.” We cannot emphasize too much the significance of the administrative penalties in that we are able to secure the effectiveness of the administration and to set the desirable direction of the administrative order thorough the administrative penalties. Particularly, the administrative penalties are divided into the administrative punishment and administrative order punishment. And the former is a sanction against the acts to violate the laws materially and the latter is a sanction against the trivial violations against the laws, which can lead to the administrative disruptions to some extent, though it does not influence the general social interests. In particular, administrative order punishment, that is, the administrative fine for minor violation against the laws, is essential means for the sake of establishment of strict administration order. Furthermore as the administrative fine is simple to impose, it is possible to secure the immediate procedure. And we can not deny the meaning and interest of the administrative fine, in that policy to adopt and apply the administrative fine is harmonious with current trend, decriminalization.  Nevertheless, it is well known that the administrative fine is a penalty that lacks the effective enforcement and imposes a trivial violation against the law. Moreover he fact that there is no clear criterion in deciding the amount of imposed administrative fine shows that the system relating to the operation of the administrative penalty is still to be improved. Thus it is necessary for us to refer to the experience of United Kingdom because the State has operated the system of the administrative fine fairly and flexibly. Taking into the consideration of the system for the sake of administrative fine in U.K., we are able to consider the diversification of the fine imposition procedure, effective provision of related information for the payment and resilience of the amount of fines and the various operation of the appeal system etc. As mentioned, it is necessary to emphasize the fact that as the administrative penalties is the sanction which is aimed to slight violation, we can not focus on the enforcement for the administrative fine too much. Therefore we had better have the reverse idea focusing on the voluntary payment of the fine rather than enforcement.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

OECD의 BEPS 프로젝트가 주목한 대상 중에는 혼성단체를 이용한 cross-border tax arbitrage가 포함되어 있고, OECD는 국내 세법상 대응 방안으로 연계 규정(linking rule)의 도입을 권고하였다. 덴마크와 영국처럼 BEPS 프로젝트 이전부터 혼성단체를 이용한 cross-border tax arbitrage에 대한 대응 입법을 마련한 나라가 있는가 하면, 멕시코와 미국은 BEPS 프로젝트 발표 이후에 연계 규정을 도입하였다.  연계 규정은 다른 나라의 세법상 법률 효과를 근거로 국내 세법을 적용하는 것이어서 이론적으로나 실무적으로나 여러 가지 어려움이 발생할 수 있으며, 이 점은 연계 규정의 입법 과정에서 간과되어서는 안 될 부분이다. 또한 우리나라는 cross-border tax arbitrage에 대한 대응 입법이나 연계 규정에 관한 경험이 많지 않아 입법이나 운용 과정에서 시행착오를 겪을 수 있다. 따라서 연계 규정의 도입 과정에서는 다른 나라의 입법례 분석이 더욱 중요하다.  우리나라가 BEPS 프로젝트 논의를 토대로 연계 규정을 도입한다면, 우선 덴마크, 영국, 멕시코, 미국의 입법례와 운용 사례를 면밀히 검토하여야 한다. 또한 다른 OECD 회원국의 입법 동향을 주의 깊게 살펴보면서 앞서 검토한 입법례 이외의 다른 형태로 입법을 할 수 있는지도 연구할 필요가 있다. 우리나라의 도입 초기에는 멕시코 및 미국의 입법례를 참고삼아 제한적 범위에서 연계 규정을 시행한 후, 운용 결과를 토대로 미비점을 보완할 수 있다. 멕시코와 미국의 입법례를 도입 초기의 모범으로 삼은 까닭은, BEPS 프로젝트의 논의를 반영한 가장 최근의 입법례일 뿐 아니라 우리나라의 현실과도 맞기 때문이다. 물론 연계 규정의 도입에 앞서, 혼성단체를 이용한 cross-border tax arbitrage 에 관한 우리나라의 실태를 정확히 파악하는 작업도 결코 소홀히 할 수 없다.","Hybrid entities can cause double taxation, but at the same time they can also be used as tools for tax arbitrage. “Tax arbitrage"" refers to transactions that make use of different or conflicting tax laws between two countries in order to result in double non-taxation. Tax arbitrage using hybrid entities can be distinguished into “Deduction/No Inclusion (D/NI)"" types and “Deduction/Deduction (D/D)"" types.  Recently, the OECD has advised OECD member states and G20 countries to counter these cases of tax arbitrage by taking legislative action. The legislative means recommended by the OECD is the so-called linking rule. The linking rule is a tax provision that links one country’s tax treatment to the tax treatment in the other country. In essence, the OECD’s linking rule suggests that in cases of the aforementioned D/NI type and D/D type tax arbitrage, domestic reverse hybrid entities should be prohibited from making deductions. The OECD further has recommended that use of the linking rule should be limited to transactions among related parties or to structured arrangements.   A look at legislative trends in other countries reveals that some countries have already adopted the linking rule prior to the OECD’s recommendation. For instance, Denmark has enacted legislation to respond to use of hybrid entities for tax arbitrage in transactions among related parties. The U.K. also has adopted provisions prohibiting U.K. corporate entities from making deductions in order to prevent tax arbitrage through hybrid entities. After the OECD’s BEPS Project, Mexico and the United States have newly enacted provisions in its tax laws that are similar to the linking rule proposed by the OECD.   Should Korea intend to prevent tax arbitrage through hybrid entities by prohibiting deduction by domestic reverse hybrid entities, it will be necessary to enact a linking rule provision which sets out the specific requirements and legal effects. First, legislation against such tax arbitrage should indeed include the other country’s tax treatment as a criterion. Second, the problem in tax arbitrages through hybrid entities lies in the double deduction of costs, which makes denial of costs deductions by domestic reverse hybrid entities an appropriate measure. Lastly, while the scope of the new legislated provision should be limited to related parties, if structured arrangements are to be included in such scope, a clear definition of the scope of structured arrangements must be given so as to grant taxpayers sufficient predictability.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

The Japanese were fascinated by the way an ancient dinosaur contaminated with radioactivity trampled over the city of Tokyo. Since then, most of the monsters in the Godzilla series have destroyed the city. Their attachment to the monsters destroying cities was related to the unconsciousness of Japanese society about rapid urbanization.  Various social issues such as the loss of traditional culture, the collapse of traditional communities, the decline in rural population, the regional inequality and the gap between the rich and the poor had emerged through the era of rapid economic growth from 1955 to 1973. Therefore, the cities had become important backgrounds of stories in art, literature, and movies. It was also a subject of reflection and consideration, and sometimes a field of visual experimentation.  In the series of Eki-Mae(means ‘in front of train station’) produced in Toho Studio from 1958 to 1969, ‘Eki-Mae’, the symbolic space in the era of rapid economic growth was the important background of the stories. The themes of the stories were conflicts of old and new, the nostalgia of the past, and adjustment to new social surroundings. Film directors who were interested in social issues often covered the subject of urbanization and the changes in lifestyle. In She and He directed by Hani Susumu, he dealt with urbanization from different perspectives on the backdrop of the same place as Kigeki Eki-Mae Danchi(Comedy – The Housing Estate in Front of the Train Station) the second film in Eki-Mae series. He raised the question of loss of humanity in the film.  By the 1960s, urbanization became even faster. In particular, during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the 1970 Osaka World Expo, Japan was developed and reorganized around major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. Due to the lack of urban workers, young local workers moved to the big cities through ‘the mass employment.’ They were called ‘the golden eggs’ and had become one of the driving force of advanced economic growth with cheap labor. Nagayama Norio who killed four people with a gun in four cities – Tokyo, Kyoto, Hakodate, and Nagoya – in October and November of 1968, also moved to Tokyo by the mass employment as a generation of the golden eggs and then changed his employment from city to city.  The landscape film A.K.A Serial Killer, about Nagayama Norio, contained urban landscapes all over Japan in the late 1960s. Adachi Masao and Matsuda Masao discovered uniformized landscapes originating from Tokyo. Oshima Nagisa captured the reality of the nation in the landscapes of Tokyo through his works such as Sing a Song of Sex and The Man Who Left His Will on Film. Teshigahara Hiroshi dealt with the alienation problem of the modern people by a private detective who lost his memory in the landscapes of Tokyo in The Man Without a Map. Matsumoto Toshio has transformed the chaotic landscapes of Shinjuku into spaces that one can afford in Funeral Parade of Roses.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

It has been served as a tool for realizing one-to-one personalization for an e-commerce service company. Traditional recommender systems, especially the recommender systems based on collaborative filtering (CF), which is the most popular recommendation algorithm in both academy and industry, are designed to generate the items list for recommendation by using ‘overall rating’ – a single criterion. However, it has critical limitations in understanding the customers’ preferences in detail. Recently, to mitigate these limitations, some leading e-commerce companies have begun to get feedback from their customers in a form of ‘multicritera ratings’. Multicriteria ratings enable the companies to understand their customers’ preferences from the multidimensional viewpoints. Moreover, it is easy to handle and analyze the multidimensional ratings because they are quantitative. But, the recommendation using multicritera ratings also has limitation that it may omit detail information on a user’s preference because it only considers three-to-five predetermined criteria in most cases.  Under this background, this study proposes a novel hybrid recommendation system, which selectively uses the results from ‘traditional CF’ and ‘CF using multicriteria ratings’. Our proposed system is based on the premise that some people have holistic preference scheme, whereas others have composite preference scheme. Thus, our system is designed to use traditional CF using overall rating for the users with holistic preference, and to use CF using multicriteria ratings for the users with composite preference.  To validate the usefulness of the proposed system, we applied it to a real-world dataset regarding the recommendation for POI (point-of-interests). Providing personalized POI recommendation is getting more attentions as the popularity of the location-based services such as Yelp and Foursquare increases. The dataset was collected from university students via a Web-based online survey system. Using the survey system, we collected the overall ratings as well as the ratings for each criterion for 48 POIs that are located near K university in Seoul, South Korea. The criteria include ‘food or taste’, ‘price’ and ‘service or mood’. As a result, we obtain 2,878 valid ratings from 112 users. Among 48 items, 38 items (80%) are used as training dataset, and the remaining 10 items (20%) are used as validation dataset. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed system (i.e. hybrid selective model), we compared its performance to the performances of two comparison models – the traditional CF and the CF with multicriteria ratings. The performances of recommender systems were evaluated by using two metrics - average MAE(mean absolute error) and precision-in-top-N. Precision-in-top-N represents the percentage of truly high overall ratings among those that the model predicted would be the N most relevant items for each user. The experimental system was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).  The experimental results showed that our proposed system (avg. MAE = 0.584) outperformed traditional CF (avg. MAE = 0.591) as well as multicriteria CF (avg. AVE = 0.608). We also found that multicriteria CF showed worse performance compared to traditional CF in our data set, which is contradictory to the results in the most previous studies. This result supports the premise of our study that people have two different types of preference schemes – holistic and composite. Besides MAE, the proposed system outperformed all the comparison models in precision-in-top-3, precision-in-top-5, and precision-in-top-7. The results from the paired samples t-test presented that our proposed system outperformed traditional CF with 10% statistical significance level, and multicriteria CF with 1% statistical significance l",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

In the early scriptures, Sampajañña was almost used along with Sati for complementary action of functions that capture the object and know the object clearly, which leads to developing wisdom. However, when Sampajañña was used alone, he knew that he only knew some facts but lacked elements of wisdom. I examined the possibility of practicing meditation in everyday life with contemporary meaning of ‘Clear Comprehension of Movement’ and applied ‘Clear Comprehension of Movement’ in the daily life such as washing dishes. The significance of this study is that the application of ‘Clear Comprehension of Movement’ to modern daily practice was proved to be possible and that the use of Sampajañña in early Buddhist texts was examined carefully.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Through this, I examined the purpose of publishing the book and the implications of publishing the book. As a result, the book confirmed that King Jeongjo(正祖) had compiled it as part of a policy of encouraging and nurturing Sungkyunkwan(成均館) students' academic knowledge. King Jeongjo(正祖) can not immediately help students with the test, but he tried to get the effect of improving student achievement by giving tae-kwa(大科) kŭp-che(及第) to chang-wŏn(壯元). In addition he expected the effect of expanding participation and interest in the nominal Sungkyunkwan(成均館) test. And Jeongjo collected the answer sheet which received excellent grades, compiled it as a book, and gave it to his students and students to set an example of sentences and learning. And he collected the answer sheet which received excellent grades, compiled it as a book, and gave it to vassals and students to set an example of sentence and learning.King Jeongjo(正祖) began publishing kyŏng-lim-mun-hŭi-lok(瓊林文喜錄) and published excellent answer sheets continuously as an example of the system of this book. Through this, He set an example for students to write answer sheets and tried to change literary spirit by learning students.Through this study, it was found that kyŏng-lim-mun-hŭi-lok(瓊林文喜錄) became an example of exam paper compilation which was continuously compiled until 1800, and at the same time, it became the starting point of the King Jeongjo(正祖)'s Policy on Writing Style.",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

As a text, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' declaration on the Communist Alliance and the reform program of the peasant Donghak were choose.This Declaration and the Reformation are the works of philosophical practice discourse of the 1800s in this article, which unfolds paradigmatically, deriving its common symbolic meaning in the semiotic sense, and evolving ideologically towards a democracy free of property.In the end, these two historical incident which are published in the contemporary breath, constitute an accusation against a nonhuman policy of surveillance and punishment. Twice a day, the space of the church is transformed into a factory, the act of dividing into two categories by capitalist and work and divorcing by accident is embodied as a social ethic. It is against the phenomenon that the structure of which no man exists is no longer institutionalized.The revolutionary movement aimed at breaking the framework of this hunt manifests itself in the two manifestos mentioned above, and Karl Marx completes the culmination of the utopia that must be achieved through the Declaration of the Communist Alliance by placing his being in the position of ""eternal refugee"". By choosing to die in his freedom developed during Jeon Bong-joon's trial, he also completes the people's spirit of revolution.In the case of simultaneous exploitation in East and West, the form of oppression is the withdrawal of capital from domination and power, and a new alternative to this is the philosophical context that allows the establishment of a new paradigm with ""man is the greatest capital"".",k-means_2018_academic_riss.csv

Evaluating Pedicle-Screw Instrumentation Using Decision-Tree Analysis Based on Pullout Strength,2018,"['Pedicle screws', 'Pullout strength', 'Osteoporosis', 'Machine learning', 'Decision-support']",,"Study Design: A biomechanical study of pedicle-screw pullout strength.Purpose: To develop a decision tree based on pullout strength for evaluating pedicle-screw instrumentation.Overview of Literature: Clinically, a surgeon’s understanding of the holding power of a pedicle screw is based on perioperative intuition (which is like insertion torque) while inserting the screw. This is a subjective feeling that depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. With the advent of robotic surgery, there is an urgent need for the creation of a patient-specific surgical planning system.A learning-based predictive model is needed to understand the sensitivity of pedicle-screw holding power to various factors.Methods: Pullout studies were carried out on rigid polyurethane foam, representing extremely osteoporotic to normal bone for different insertion depths and angles of a pedicle screw. The results of these experimental studies were used to build a pullout-strength predictor and a decision tree using a machine-learning approach.Results: Based on analysis of variance, it was found that all the factors under study had a significant effect (p <0.05) on the holding power of a pedicle screw. Of the various machine-learning techniques, the random forest regression model performed well in predicting the pullout strength and in creating a decision tree. Performance was evaluated, and a correlation coefficient of 0.99 was obtained between the observed and predicted values. The mean and standard deviation of the normalized predicted pullout strength for the confirmation experiment using the current model was 1.01±0.04.Conclusions: The random forest regression model was used to build a pullout-strength predictor and decision tree. The model was able to predict the holding power of a pedicle screw for any combination of density, insertion depth, and insertion angle for the chosen range.

Predictors of intentional intoxication using decision tree modeling analysis: a retrospective study,2018,"['Decision support techniques', 'Intoxication', 'Suicide']",,"Objective The suicide rate in South Korea is very high and is expected to increase in coming years. Intoxication is the most common suicide attempt method as well as one of the common reason for presenting to an emergency medical center. We used decision tree modeling analysis to identify predictors of risk for suicide by intentional intoxication. Methods A single-center, retrospective study was conducted at our hospital using a 4-year registry of the institute from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. Demographic factors, such as sex, age, intentionality, therapeutic adherence, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical disease, cancer, psychiatric disease, and toxicological factors, such as type of intoxicant and poisoning severity score were collected. Candidate risk factors based on the decision tree were used to select variables for multiple logistic regression analysis. Results In total, 4,023 patients with intoxication were enrolled as study participants, with 2,247 (55.9%) identified as cases of intentional intoxication. Reported annual percentages of intentional intoxication among patients were 628/937 (67.0%), 608/1,082 (56.2%), 536/1,017 (52.7), 475/987 (48.1%) from 2013 to 2016. Significant predictors identified based on decision tree analysis were alcohol consumption, old age, psychiatric disease, smoking, and male sex; those identified based on multiple regression analysis were alcohol consumption, smoking, male sex, psychiatric disease, old age, poor therapeutic adherence, and physical disease. Conclusion We identified important predictors of suicide risk by intentional intoxication. A specific and realistic approach to analysis using the decision tree modeling technique is an effective method to determine those groups at risk of suicide by intentional intoxication.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

Thirty-nine patients, treated between January 2000 and June 2017, were eligible for the analysis. Ocular outcomes were classified as follows: 1) no light perception (NLP), 2) light perception (LP), 3) hand motion (HM), 4) counting fingers (CF), and 5) 20/200 or better. Logistic regression and decision tree analyses were used to identify risk factors that were associated with poor outcomes.Results: Pathogens were identified in 23 (58.9%) samples from blood, liver aspirate, and/or vitreous humor. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent organism (12/39, 30.8%), followed by Candida species (3/39, 8.3%). The most common combined infection was liver abscess (16/39, 41.0%). Acute pyelonephritis occurred in 30.8% of cases (12/39). Final ocular outcomes were as follows: 35.9% (14/39) NLP, 15.4% (6/39) LP, 15.4% (6/39) HM, 7.7% (3/39) CF, and 25.6% (10/39) 20/200 or better. K. pneumoniae was a poor prognostic factor in univariate (odds ratio [OR], 13.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-130.9) and multivariate (OR, 17.5; 95% CI, 2.1-398.8) regression analyses (NLP and LP vs. HM, CF, and 20/200 or better). Other factors did not reach statistical difference. Decision tree analysis identified K. pneumoniae as a node that divided ocular outcomes (P = 0.017).Conclusions: In conclusion, K. pneumoniae is the most frequent causative pathogen of EE. Considering the poor prognosis and rapid progression of K. pneumoniae EE, physicians should test for K. pneumoniae EE in patients who experience acute systemic infections with ocular signs and symptoms.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

An FPT 2-Approximation for Tree-Cut Decomposition,2018,,,"<P>The tree-cut width of a graph is a graph parameter defined by Wollan (J Combin Theory, Ser B, 110:47-66, 2015) with the help of tree-cut decompositions. In certain cases, tree-cut width appears to be more adequate than treewidth as an invariant that, when bounded, can accelerate the resolution of intractable problems. While designing algorithms for problems with bounded tree-cut width, it is important to have a parametrically tractable way to compute the exact value of this parameter or, at least, some constant approximation of it. In this paper we give a parameterized 2-approximation algorithm for the computation of tree-cut width; for an input n-vertex graph G and an integer w, our algorithm either confirms that the tree-cut width of G is more than w or returns a tree-cut decomposition of G certifying that its tree-cut width is at most 2w, in time . Prior to this work, no constructive parameterized algorithms, even approximated ones, existed for computing the tree-cut width of a graph. As a consequence of the Graph Minors series by Robertson and Seymour, only the existence of a decision algorithm was known.</P>",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

Investment Decision Making under Uncertainty Using Real Options Approach: A Case Study in Solar Power Plants of Iran,2018,"['Project Valuation', 'Real Options', 'Photovoltaic System', 'Uncertainty', 'Binomial Tree Method', 'Taguchi design Experiments']",,"Nowadays, classic Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach is mostly used in order to evaluate various types ofprojects. Since projects in all around the world are confronting with different barriers, such as high risk, various kindsof uncertainty, the aforesaid classic approach cannot correctly determine the value of projects. Therefore, proposingpractical and efficient approaches in evaluation of project in uncertain environment has drawn the attention of researchersin recent years. In this study, an efficient approach for valuing of solar photovoltaic power plants in Iranwith real options is proposed and compared with the classic DCF approach. In order to evaluate the assumed real options,the binomial tree method is implemented. Eventually, Taguchi design experiment is used to analyze the performanceof binomial tree and figure out how real options parameters effect on the value of project. The obtained resultsshow that considering abovementioned real options increases the value of project comparing to the case with no realoptions (i.e. DCF approach). Moreover, the ranking of effective factors, participations percentage of each factors onresponse variable, and optimal combination of them are determined.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

The study is based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VI and VII) from 2013 to 2016. Methods: The sociodemographic and clinical data of 504 Korean cancer survivors aged 20-64 years was extracted from the KNHANES VI and VII database. Descriptive statistics for complex samples was used, and decision-tree analyses were performed using the SPSS WIN 24.0 program. Results: The mean age for survivors was approximately 51 years. The mean sleep duration was 6.97 hours; 36.2% of participants had short (<7 hours) and 9.9% had long (>8 hours) sleep duration. From the decision-trees analyses, the characteristics of the adult cancer survivors related to sleep problems were presented with six different pathways. Sleep problems were analyzed according to the survivors’ sociodemographic information (age, education, living status, and occupation), clinical characteristics (body mass index, hypercholesterolemia, and anemia) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The HRQoL (≤0.5 or >0.5 cutoff point) was a significant predictor of the participants’ sleep problems because all six pathways were started from this predictor in the model. Conclusion: Health care professionals could use the decision-tree model for screening adult cancer survivors with sleep problems in clinical or community settings. Nursing interventions considering these specific individual characteristics and HRQoL level should be developed to have adequate sleep duration for Korean adult cancer survivors.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

The reason of the study is that the elderly welfare center as a provider of general welfare services could not only thinking about the state policy but also need to consider about the inherent role and function of the elderly. Especially for these elders living in rural areas, although the number of elderly welfare centers of the whole country has greatly increased in last 10 years, the effect and function of the facility are almost the same and they are still lack of leisure activities. This issue become a serious problem nowadays. For the above reasons, this article conducts a social survey of 360 elderly people over the age of 65 who lives in the Gimpo city which is a rural-urban type city. The research method is to examine the relationship between the predisposing factors, enabling factors and need factors of Andersen’s behavior model with binary logistic regression analysis and the decision tree analysis.The result of binary logistic regression shows the most of factors of Andersen’s model is significant. The factors of age, gender, education level in predisposing factors; monthly income in enabling factors and the reserve for old life, the preparation of economic activity for old life in need factors are significant. Then the result of decision tree analysis shows the interaction between factors; when the education level in predisposing factors is higher, the possibility of using of elderly welfare center becomes bigger. Also as the level of healthy promoting preparation in the need factors gets lower, the possibility of using of elderly welfare center still becomes bigger. Although differences were found in the interpretation of the results of regression analysis and decision tree analysis, the results of this study can still provide support for the necessity of elderly welfare centers providing integrated welfare services.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

METHODS: To improve the proposed overall rehabilitation decision tree, current decision tree from Korea and decision trees from other countries were summarized and investigated. The problem when applying the current rehabilitation method obtained from the decision tree applied in Seoul was further analyzed. It was found that the current decision trees do not consider different distress characteristics such as crack type, road types and functions. Because of this, different distress values for IRI, crack rate and plastic deformation was added to the proposed decision tree to properly recommend appropriate pavement rehabilitation. Utilizing the 2017 Seoul pavement management system data and considering all factors as discussed, the proposed overall decision tree was revised and improved. RESULTS: In this study, the type of crack was included to the decision tree. Meanwhile current design thickness and special asphalt mixture were studied and improved to be applied on different pavement condition. In addition, the improved decision tree was incorporated with the Seoul asphalt overlay design program. In the case of Seoul's rehabilitation budget, rehabilitation budget can be optimized if a 25mm milling and overlay thickness is used. CONCLUSIONS: A practical and theoretical evaluation tool in pavement rehabilitation design was presented and proposed for Seoul City.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

Unfortunately, the spectral bands available in the multispectral imagery are broad and limited in number to classify the crop species. In this paper, we propose optimal spectral bands to classify Allium (garlic and onion) and Brassicaceae (Chinese cabbage and radish) by using higher-dimensional data from hyperspectral imagery. A decision-tree classifier was used to determine the optimal method to use the high-dimensional data. The high-dimensional data were analysed for all growth stages and considering bandwidths with different full width at half maximum (FWHM) values at 25, 40, 50 and 80 nm. The spectral bands selected for Allium were differentiated into green, blue, and NIR bands for each growth stage. The results show that Allium can be classified clearly as overall accuracy (OA) 1 and kappa coefficient 1 for all FWHM based on March 22 data. For each April 19 and May 12 data, the decision-tree classifier with each 80 nm FWHM and 50 nm FWHM yielded a better classification accuracy of more than OA 0.921 and kappa coefficient 0.839 than other FWHM.

However, as the table size increases, it takes more time to build or update the table. Since various cyber attacks recently emerge, the security policies in each network security equipment have the higher complexity and their size is rapidly increasing. Thus, existing algorithms can suffer from too large table under this situation. In this paper, we propose a new packet classification approach to resolve this problem. A variety of cut-based packet classification algorithms such as HiCuts and HyperCuts have been developed to search a matching policy fast in network security equipment. Cut-based algorithms are known for fast search performance using a moderate sized table. They usually use only one cutting scheme to build a decision tree. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm simultaneously applies two cutting schemes, therefore reducing the height of the decision tree significantly. In addition, it utilizes cache-aware design for building the decision tree, not only the packet classification speed can be greatly improved, but also the total size of the search table can be greatly reduced.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

Prior studies applying data mining techniques for predicting disease can be classified into a model design study for predicting cardiovascular disease and a study comparing disease prediction research results. In the case of foreign literatures, studies predicting cardiovascular disease were predominant in predicting disease using data mining techniques. Although domestic studies were not much different from those of foreign countries, studies focusing on hypertension and diabetes were mainly conducted. Since hypertension and diabetes as well as chronic diseases, hyperlipidemia, are also of high importance, this study selected hyperlipidemia as the disease to be analyzed. We also developed a model for predicting hyperlipidemia using SVM and meta learning algorithms, which are already known to have excellent predictive power.  In order to achieve the purpose of this study, we used data set from Korea Health Panel 2012. The Korean Health Panel produces basic data on the level of health expenditure, health level and health behavior, and has conducted an annual survey since 2008. In this study, 1,088 patients with hyperlipidemia were randomly selected from the hospitalized, outpatient, emergency, and chronic disease data of the Korean Health Panel in 2012, and 1,088 nonpatients were also randomly extracted. A total of 2,176 people were selected for the study.  Three methods were used to select input variables for predicting hyperlipidemia. First, stepwise method was performed using logistic regression. Among the 17 variables, the categorical variables(except for length of smoking) are expressed as dummy variables, which are assumed to be separate variables on the basis of the reference group, and these variables were analyzed. Six variables (age, BMI, education level, marital status, smoking status, gender) excluding income level and smoking period were selected based on significance level 0.1. Second, C4.5 as a decision tree algorithm is used. The significant input variables were age, smoking status, and education level. Finally, C4.5 as a decision tree algorithm is used. In SVM, the input variables selected by genetic algorithms consisted of 6 variables such as age, marital status, education level, economic activity, smoking period, and physical activity status, and the input variables selected by genetic algorithms in artificial neural network consist of 3 variables such as age, marital status, and education level.  Based on the selected parameters, we compared SVM, meta learning algorithm and other prediction models for hyperlipidemia patients, and compared the classification performances using TP rate and precision.  The main results of the analysis are as follows. First, the accuracy of the SVM was 88.4% and the accuracy of the artificial neural network was 86.7%. Second, the accuracy of classification models using the selected input variables through stepwise method was slightly higher than that of classification models using the whole variables. Third, the precision of artificial neural network was higher than that of SVM when only three variables as input variables were selected by decision trees. As a result of classification models based on the input variables selected through the genetic algorithm, classification accuracy of SVM was 88.5% and that of artificial neural network was 87.9%.

Following training, these models were compared to the predictive capability of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification.Results: A total of 20,879 patients were identified as having undergone ACDF. Following exclusion criteria, patients were divided into 14,615 patients for training and 6,264 for testing data sets. ANN and LR consistently outperformed ASA physical status classification in predicting every complication (p<0.05). The ANN outperformed LR in predicting venous thromboembolism, wound complication, and mortality (p<0.05). The SVM and RF models were no better than random chance at predicting any of the postoperative complications (p<0.05).Conclusion: ANN and LR algorithms outperform ASA physical status classification for predicting individual postoperative complications. Additionally, neural networks have greater sensitivity than LR when predicting mortality and wound complications.

Though there is the special provision for land division in Article 67 of “Act on the Maintenance and Improvement of Urban Area and Dwelling Conditions” to solve this problem, its effect is not enough but new conflict is generated. To solve this problem, the analysis data was constructed through the survey on the parties in the redevelopment projects. In the analysis, cluster analysis was made to classify the conflicts and the first and second analyses in the decision-making tree were conducted to find out the improvement element.

To statistically assess the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption rates per year, the 1:5,000 Digital Forest- Map (Lim5000) and Standard Carbon Removal of Major Forest Species (SCRMF) methods were employed. Furthermore, Land Cover Map (LCM) was also used to verify CO2 absorption rate availability per year. Great variations in CO<sub>2</sub> absorption rates occurred before and after the year 2010. This was due to improvement in precision and accuracy of the Forest Basic Statistics (FBS) in 2010, which resulted in rapid increase in growing stock. Thus, calibration of data prior to 2010 is necessary, based on recent FBS standards. Previous studies that employed Lim5000 and FBS (2015, 2010) did not take into account the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption rates of different tree species, and the combination of SCRMF and Lim5000 resulted in CO<sub>2</sub> absorption of 42,369 ton.

중소기업 프로파일링 분석을 통한 기술유출 방지 및 보호 모형 연구,2018,"['SME', 'Technology Leakage', 'Profiling Analysis', 'Data Mining', 'ICT']",,"PurposeCorporate technology leakage is not only monetary loss, but also has a negative impact on the corporate image and further deteriorates sustainable growth. In particular, since SMEs are highly dependent on core technologies compared to large corporations, loss of technology leakage threatens corporate survival. Therefore, it is important for SMEs to prevent and protect technology leakage. With the recent development of data analysis technology and the opening of public data, it has become possible to discover and proactively detect companies with a high probability of technology leakage based on actual company data. In this study, we try to construct profiles of enterprises with and without technology leakage experience through profiling analysis using data mining techniques. Furthermore, based on this, we propose a classification model that distinguishes companies that are likely to leak technology.Design/methodology/approachThis study tries to develop the empirical model for prevention and protection of technology leakage through profiling method which analyzes each SME from the viewpoint of individual. Based on the previous research, we tried to classify many characteristics of SMEs into six categories and to identify the factors influencing the technology leakage of SMEs from the enterprise point of view. Specifically, we divided the 29 SME characteristics into the following six categories: 'firm characteristics', 'organizational characteristics', 'technical characteristics', 'relational characteristics', 'financial characteristics', and 'enterprise core competencies'. Each characteristic was extracted from the questionnaire data of 'Survey of Small and Medium Enterprises Technology’ carried out annually by the Government of the Republic of Korea. Since the number of SMEs with experience of technology leakage in questionnaire data was significantly smaller than the other, we made a 1: 1 correspondence with each sample through mixed sampling. We conducted profiling of companies with and without technology leakage experience using decision-tree technique for research data, and derived meaningful variables that can distinguish the two. Then, empirical model for prevention and protection of technology leakage was developed through discriminant analysis and logistic regression analysis.FindingsProfiling analysis shows that technology novelty, enterprise technology group, number of intellectual property registrations, product life cycle, technology development infrastructure level(absence of dedicated organization), enterprise core competency(design) and enterprise core competency(process design) help us find SME’s technology leakage. We developed the two empirical model for prevention and protection of technology leakage in SMEs using discriminant analysis and logistic regression analysis, and each hit ratio is 65%(discriminant analysis) and 67%(logistic regression analysis).",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

KOSDAQ 시장의 관리종목 지정 탐지 모형 개발,2018,"['관리종목', '로지스틱 회귀분석', '의사결정나무', '코스닥 기업', 'Administrative Issue', 'Logistic Regression', 'Decision Tree', 'KOSDAQ-listed Companies']",,"The purpose of this research is to develop a detection model for companies designated as administrative issue in KOSDAQ market using financial data. Administration issue designates the companies with high potential for delisting, which gives them time to overcome the reasons for the delisting under certain restrictions of the Korean stock market. It acts as an alarm to inform investors and market participants of which companies are likely to be delisted and warns them to make safe investments. Despite this importance, there are relatively few studies on administration issues prediction model in comparison with the lots of studies on bankruptcy prediction model. Therefore, this study develops and verifies the detection model of the companies designated as administrative issue using financial data of KOSDAQ companies. In this study, logistic regression and decision tree are proposed as the data mining models for detecting administrative issues.  According to the results of the analysis, the logistic regression model predicted the companies designated as administrative issue using three variables - ROE(Earnings before tax), Cash flows/Shareholder’s equity, and Asset turnover ratio, and its overall accuracy was 86% for the validation dataset. The decision tree (Classification and Regression Trees, CART) model applied the classification rules using Cash flows/Total assets and ROA(Net income), and the overall accuracy reached 87%.   Implications of the financial indictors selected in our logistic regression and decision tree models are as follows. First, ROE(Earnings before tax) in the logistic detection model shows the profit and loss of the business segment that will continue without including the revenue and expenses of the discontinued business. Therefore, the weakening of the variable means that the competitiveness of the core business is weakened. If a large part of the profits is generated from one-off profit, it is very likely that the deterioration of business management is further intensified. As the ROE of a KOSDAQ company decreases significantly, it is highly likely that the company can be delisted. Second, cash flows to shareholder’s equity represents that the firm`s ability to generate cash flow under the condition that the financial condition of the subsidiary company is excluded. In other words, the weakening of the management capacity of the parent company, excluding the subsidiary`s competence, can be a main reason for the increase of the possibility of administrative issue designation. Third, low asset turnover ratio means that current assets and non-current assets are ineffectively used by corporation, or that asset investment by corporation is excessive. If the asset turnover ratio of a KOSDAQ-listed company decreases, it is necessary to examine in detail corporate activities from various perspectives such as weakening sales or increasing or decreasing inventories of company. Cash flow / total assets, a variable selected by the decision tree detection model, is a key indicator of the companys cash condition and its ability to generate cash from operating activities. Cash flow indicates whether a firm can perform its main activities(maintaining its operating ability, repaying debts, paying dividends and making new investments) without relying on external financial resources. Therefore, if the index of the variable is negative(-), it indicates the possibility that a company has serious problems in business activities. If the cash flow from operating activities of a specific company is smaller than the net profit, it means that the net profit has not been cashed, indicating that there is a serious problem in managing the trade receivables and inventory assets of the company. Therefore, it can be understood that as the cash flows / total assets decrease, the probability of administrative issue designation and the probability of delisting are increased.

Furthermore, any tree planted in mid January could not have survived the frigid winter weather in Korea. These facts point to the possibility that the story of the two figures planting Kaizukabuki in Dalseong was fabricated.This situation seems to have resulted from the critical omission of paragraphs on the commemoration planting in Daegu iyagi (the Story of Daegu), the only Korean translation of Kawai’s 1930 Taikyū Monogatari (『大邱物語』). We conclude that there is no association between the two large old Kaizukaibuki trees in Dalseong and the story of commemoration planting by the King and Ito, and that the Kaizukaibuki is, in fact, a Korean ethnobotanical plant, Juniperus chinensis. In future research, a biosociological analysis needs to be made on the infiltration of closed exclusivism embued in the Japanese invasionist view of history, when it comes to the landscape restoration of historical sites, including the selection or exclusion of specific plant species.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv
A pilot study using machine learning methods about factors influencing prognosis of dental implants,2018,"['Machine learning', 'Decision tree', 'Support vector machine', 'Dental implant', 'Implant prognosis']",,"PURPOSE. This study tried to find the most significant factors predicting implant prognosis using machine learning methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The data used in this study was based on a systematic search of chart files at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for one year. In this period, oral and maxillofacial surgeons inserted 667 implants in 198 patients after consultation with a prosthodontist. The traditional statistical methods were inappropriate in this study, which analyzed the data of a small sample size to find a factor affecting the prognosis. The machine learning methods were used in this study, since these methods have analyzing power for a small sample size and are able to find a new factor that has been unknown to have an effect on the result. A decision tree model and a support vector machine were used for the analysis. RESULTS. The results identified mesio-distal position of the inserted implant as the most significant factor determining its prognosis. Both of the machine learning methods, the decision tree model and support vector machine, yielded the similar results. CONCLUSION. Dental clinicians should be careful in locating implants in the patient's mouths, especially mesio-distally, to minimize the negative complications against implant survival.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv
"Assessing the impact of air pollution on mortality rate from cardiovascular disease in Seoul, Korea",2018,"['Air pollution', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Decision tree model', 'PM2.5', 'Temperature']",,"The adverse health impact of air pollution is becoming more serious. The purpose of this study is twofold: One is to analyze the effect of air pollution and temperatures on human health by analyzing the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease in Seoul, Korea; the other is to determine what impact the location of a monitoring site has on the results of a health study. For this latter purpose, air pollution and temperature monitors are sited at three locations termed green, public, and residential. Then, a decision tree model is used to analyze factors linked with deaths occurring at each monitoring site. The results show that the environmental temperatures before death and the PM2.5 concentrations on the day of death are highly linked with the number of deaths regardless of the monitoring location. However, results are most accurate with residential data. The results of this study can be used as base data for a similar analysis and ultimately, as a guide to minimize the health impact of air pollution.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

Thus it is difficult to know how much they are exposed to crime. If the police can predict the crime risky area, it will be possible to cope with the crime efficiently even though insufficient police and enforcement resources. However, there is no prediction system in Korea and the related researches are very much poor. From these backgrounds, the final goal of this study is to develop an automated crime prediction system. However, for the first step, we build a big data set which consists of local real crime information and urban physicalor non-physical data. Then, we developed a crime prediction model through machine learning method. Finally, we assumed several possible scenarios and calculated the probability of crime and visualized the results in a map so as to increase the people's understanding. Among the factors affecting the crime occurrence revealed in previous and case studies, data was processed in the form of a big data for machine learning: real crime information, weather information (temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, sunshine, insolation, snowfall, cloud cover) and local information (average building coverage, average floor area ratio, average building height, number of buildings, average appraised land value, average area of residential building, average number of ground floor). Among the supervised machine learning algorithms, the decision tree model, the random forest model, and the SVM model, which are known to be powerful and accurate in various fields were utilized to construct crime prevention model. As a result, decision tree model with the lowest RMSE was selected as an optimal prediction model. Based on this model, several scenarios were set for theft and violence cases which are the most frequent in the case city J, and the probability of crime was estimated by 250x250m grid. As a result, we could find that the high crime risky area is occurring in three patterns in case city J. The probability of crime was divided into three classes and visualized in map by 250 x 250m grid. Finally, we could develop a crime prediction model using machine learning algorithm and visualized the crime risky areas in a map which can recalculate the model and visualize the result simultaneously as time and urban conditions change.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

In response, South Korea is operating seven pumped-storage power plants whose capacity is equal to that of about five nuclear power plants, accounts for 5.9% of the total power capacity of South Korea. The pumped turbine is a machine that operates through forward and reverse rotations to store energy and produce electric power. It requires high reliability for rapidly generating electricity on load. The losses caused by the shutdown of the power plants due to turbine failures, and the costs of their recovery, are enormous. Thus, improving the reliability of a pumped-storage power plant will have a significant influence on the national power system. In this regard, this research seeks to increase the reliability of the pumped storage power plant by identifying the problematic factors. This study proposes models of Case Based Reasoning (CBR) for eliminating possible problematic factors in pumped storage power plants before operation phase through predicting and checking failure.

Also, the multi-category logit model and proportional odds logit model was constructed as a strategy for determining the betting score. As a result, there was no significant difference in the performance between the three models for the buzz-in strategy. In the betting strategy, it was confirmed that the recommended betting score based on the statistical model was better than the one determined by the human participants.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

An Efficient One Class Classifier Using Gaussian-based Hyper-Rectangle Generation,2018,"['Imbalanced Dataset', 'One-Class Classification', 'Classifier Using Hyper-Rectangle', 'Classification Rate', 'Interpretability']",,"In recent years, imbalanced data is one of the most important and frequent issue for quality control in industrial field. As an example, defect rate has been drastically reduced thanks to highly developed technology and quality management, so that only few defective data can be obtained from production process. Therefore, quality classification should be performed under the condition that one class (defective dataset) is even smaller than the other class (good dataset). However, traditional multi-class classification methods are not appropriate to deal with such an imbalanced dataset, since they classify data from the difference between one class and the others that can hardly be found in imbalanced datasets. Thus, one-class classification that thoroughly learns patterns of target class is more suitable for imbalanced dataset since it only focuses on data in a target class. So far, several one-class classification methods such as one-class support vector machine, neural network and decision tree there have been suggested.

Those text data were produced and distributed through various media platforms such as World Wide Web, Internet news feeds, microblog, and social media. However, this enormous amount of easily obtained information is lack of organization. Therefore, this problem has raised the interest of many researchers in order to manage this huge amount of information. Further, this problem also required professionals that are capable of classifying relevant information and hence text classification is introduced. Text classification is a challenging task in modern data analysis, which it needs to assign a text document into one or more predefined categories or classes. In text classification field, there are different kinds of techniques available such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes Algorithm, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network.  However, while dealing with huge amount of text data, model performance and accuracy becomes a challenge. According to the type of words used in the corpus and type of features created for classification, the performance of a text classification model can be varied. Most of the attempts are been made based on proposing a new algorithm or modifying an existing algorithm. This kind of research can be said already reached their certain limitations for further improvements. In this study, aside from proposing a new algorithm or modifying the algorithm, we focus on searching a way to modify the use of data. It is widely known that classifier performance is influenced by the quality of training data upon which this classifier is built. The real world datasets in most of the time contain noise, or in other words noisy data, these can actually affect the decision made by the classifiers built from these data. In this study, we consider that the data from different domains, which is heterogeneous data might have the characteristics of noise which can be utilized in the classification process.  In order to build the classifier, machine learning algorithm is performed based on the assumption that the characteristics of training data and target data are the same or very similar to each other. However, in the case of unstructured data such as text, the features are determined according to the vocabularies included in the document. If the viewpoints of the learning data and target data are different, the features may be appearing different between these two data. In this study, we attempt to improve the classification accuracy by strengthening the robustness of the document classifier through artificially injecting the noise into the process of constructing the document classifier.  With data coming from various kind of sources, these data are likely formatted differently. These cause difficulties for traditional machine learning algorithms because they are not developed to recognize different type of data representation at one time and to put them together in same generalization. Therefore, in order to utilize heterogeneous data in the learning process of document classifier, we apply semi-supervised learning in our study. However, unlabeled data might have the possibility to degrade the performance of the document classifier. Therefore, we further proposed a method called Rule Selection-Based Ensemble Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithm (RSESLA) to select only the documents that contributing to the accuracy improvement of the classifier. RSESLA creates multiple views by manipulating the features using different types of classification models and different types of heterogeneous data. The most confident classification rules will be selected and applied for the final decision making.

Diagnostic criteria for TBM were categorized into three groups: definite, probable, and possible TBM. The VM group included patients with no evidence of other meningitis who achieved complete recovery with only conservative treatments. Clinical, laboratory and radiological findings, as well as outcomes, were compared between the TBM and VM groups.Results: Ninety-eight patients were enrolled. Among the study patients, 47 had TBM and 51 had VM. Based on univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression, sodium < 135 mmol/L in serum (hyponatremia), lactate dehydrogenase > 70 (U/L) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), protein > 160 (mg/dL) in CSF, voiding difficulty, and symptoms of cranial nerve palsy were significant predictive factors for TBM in the final model. We constructed a weighted scoring system with predictive factors from multiple regression analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses and decision tree analyses were plotted to reveal an optimum cutoff point as 4 with this scoring system (range: 0–13).Conclusion: For differential diagnosis between TBM and VM, we created a new weighted scoring system.

However, lead-acid batteries have a serious problem in that deterioration of a battery makes progress quickly in the presence of that degradation of only one cell among several cells which is packed in a battery begins. To overcome this problem, previous researches have attempted to identify the mechanism of deterioration of a battery in many ways. However, most of previous researches have used data obtained in a laboratory to analyze the mechanism of deterioration of a battery but not used data obtained in a real world. The usage of real data can increase the feasibility and the applicability of the findings of a research. Therefore, this study aims to develop a model which predicts the battery deterioration using data obtained in real world. To this end, we collected data which presents change of battery state by attaching sensors enabling to monitor the battery condition in real time to dozens of golf carts operated in the real golf field. As a result, total 16,883 samples were obtained. And then, we developed a model which predicts a precursor phenomenon representing deterioration of a battery by analyzing the data collected from the sensors using machine learning techniques. As initial independent variables, we used 1) inbound time of a cart, 2) outbound time of a cart, 3) duration(from outbound time to charge time), 4) charge amount, 5) used amount, 6) charge efficiency, 7) lowest temperature of battery cell 1 to 6, 8) lowest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, 9) highest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, 10) voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the beginning of operation, 11) voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the end of charge, 12) used amount of battery cell 1 to 6 during operation, 13) used amount of battery during operation(Max-Min), 14) duration of battery use, and 15) highest current during operation. Since the values of the independent variables, lowest temperature of battery cell 1 to 6, lowest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, highest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the beginning of operation, voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the end of charge, and used amount of battery cell 1 to 6 during operation are similar to that of each battery cell, we conducted principal component analysis using verimax orthogonal rotation in order to mitigate the multiple collinearity problem. According to the results, we made new variables by averaging the values of independent variables clustered together, and used them as final independent variables instead of origin variables, thereby reducing the dimension. We used decision tree, logistic regression, Bayesian network as algorithms for building prediction models. And also, we built prediction models using the bagging of each of them, the boosting of each of them, and RandomForest. Experimental results show that the prediction model using the bagging of decision tree yields the best accuracy of 89.3923%. This study has some limitations in that the additional variables which affect the deterioration of battery such as weather (temperature, humidity) and driving habits, did not considered, therefore, we would like to consider the them in the future research. However, the battery deterioration prediction model proposed in the present study is expected to enable effective and efficient management of battery used in the real filed by dramatically and to reduce the cost caused by not detecting battery deterioration accordingly.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

Therefore, reducing the dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery is necessary. In this study, the Random Forest (RF) classifier was utilized for dimensionality reduction as well as classification purpose.

Methods: This retrospective study examined patient visits in Emergency Department (ED) with sepsis related diagnosis. The outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Using odds ratio (OR) and modeling methods (decision tree [DT], multivariate logistic regression [LR], and naïve Bayes [NB]), the relationships between diagnostic criteria and mortality were examined. Results: Of 132,704 eligible patient visits, 14% died within 28 days of ED admission.The association of qSOFA ≥2 with mortality (OR = 3.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.96–3.17) greater than the association of SIRS ≥2 with mortality (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.18–1.26). The area under the ROC curve for qSOFA (AUROC = 0.70) was significantly greater than for SIRS (AUROC = 0.63).

Although dynamic fingerprints are damage-sensitive, they are rarely applied to bridges in-situ due to environmental noise. Machine learning techniques can facilitate effective structural damage detection. This paper proposes a detection method based on dynamic fingerprints and machine learning techniques for multi-damage problems in bridges. Vibration analysis is conducted to acquire the dynamic fingerprints, then the Bayesian fusion is used to integrate these features and preliminarily locate the damage. The RSNB method, which combines Rough Set theory and the Naive-Bayes classifier, is introduced as a robust classification tool for damage qualification. A continuous bridge is numerically simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The RSNB method is compared with back propagation neural network, support vector machine, and decision tree techniques, it is found that the RSNB outperforms other three methods in terms of transparency, accuracy, efficiency, noise robustness, and stability.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv

There are many traditional instruments in Korea, and most of the traditional songs played using the instruments have similar patterns and rhythms. Although music information processing such as music genre classification and audio melody extraction have been studied, most studies have focused on pop, jazz, rock, and other universal genres. There are few studies on Korean traditional music because of the lack of datasets. This paper analyzes raw audio and MIDI phrases in Korean traditional music, performed using Korean traditional musical instruments. The classified samples and MIDI, based on our classification system, will be used to construct a database or to implement our Kontakt-based instrument library. Thus, we can construct a management system for a Korean traditional music library using this classification system.

Background: Pilots can experience high cognitive workload conditions by performing various tasks simultaneously during air operation mission. Accurate detection of the cognitive workload state is required to improve the survivability of pilots and ensure flight safety.  Method: Five student pilots in 20s performed dual task consisting of simulated flight task with baseline task and three levels of N-back task (0-back, 1-back, 2-back). Three flight performance features (standard deviation of altitude, heading, airspeed) and two heart rate variability features (standard deviation of NN (SDNN), Low Frequency to High Frequency ratio (LF/HF)) were measured from the flight simulation experiment with photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor. Cognitive workload classification model was developed by pre-processing input features and output classes, applying five classifiers (Decision tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Bayesian, Ensemble), and validating the model performance.  Results: High cognitive workload level (2-back) was 327%, 161%, and 1.2% higher than baseline in terms of standard deviation of altitude, standard deviation of airspeed, and LF/HF respectively.

Conclusion: The best classifier performance for detecting cognitive workload levels of pilots was acquired from an ensemble classifier with two output classes (baseline, 2-back) with an accuracy of 96.6%.  Application: The cognitive workload classification model using the ensemble classifier in this study can contribute to the development of a system capable of providing warning signal in real time under pilot""s cognitive overload situation.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv
A Novel Feature Selection Method in the Categorization of Imbalanced Textual Data,2018,"['Feature selection', 'Imbalanced class', 'High dimensionality', 'Text classification']",,"Text data distribution is often imbalanced. Imbalanced data is one of the challenges in text classification, as it leads to the loss of performance of classifiers. Many studies have been conducted so far in this regard. The proposed solutions are divided into several general categories, include sampling-based and algorithm-based methods. In recent studies, feature selection has also been considered as one of the solutions for the imbalance problem. In this paper, a novel one-sided feature selection known as probabilistic feature selection (PFS) was presented for imbalanced text classification. The PFS is a probabilistic method that is calculated using feature distribution. Compared to the similar methods, the PFS has more parameters. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the feature selection methods including Gini, MI, FAST and DFS were implemented. To assess the proposed method, the decision tree classifications such as C4.5 and Naive Bayes were used.

Firms with foreign workers evaluate that foreign workers tend to be more productive over native non-regular workers, thus pay more to the foreigners. Furthermore, firms hiring foreign workers pay higher wages than firms not hiring foreign. These findings support the view that firms with foreign workers are more profitable and the relationship between native and foreign worker would be complementary each other, boosting productivity of the firm. However, these phenomenon seems to out of the intention of the Work Permit System that allows to hire foreign workers only in certain sectors and firms not being able to find native workers in it.

It tries to answer the question “Who leaves comments on online news articles or shares news stories with others?” Commenting on news articles and sharing news stories influence news consumption and society at large, but it is not clear who is leaving the comments and sharing the news. This study differs from previous studies because it applies statistical learning in order to obtain the closest answer to reality, not by making assumptions but by using real data. This paper proposes an optimal model for predicting comment writers and news sharers by applying logistic regression analyses, linear/nonlinear discriminant analyses, decision tree models, random forests, and support vector machines. As a result, we could predict the commenters and the sharers with 99% and 94% accuracy, respectively, using random forests. Furthermore, it is reasonable to consider commenters and news sharers the “leaders of the online news culture” because the groups were identified to be almost identical. They were highly educated, politically liberal or moderate, and active in social activities such as signing campaigns and making donations. In addition, people with a lower amount of trust in national news media tended to write comments and share news, and the more socially influential they regard journalists as being, the more likely they are to share news stories. Finally, the leaders of the online news culture spend a significant amount of time on social networking sites and messaging services. Particularly, news commenters consume or participate in new independent media such as podcasts or YouTube videos, and news sharers actively read news from various media, including social networking sites, messaging services, and political magazines.",decision_tree_2018_academic_riss.csv
Semi-supervised Multi-view Manifold Discriminant Intact Space Learning,2018,"['Semi-supervised learning', 'Manifold discriminant intact space', 'Generated multi-view data points', 'Intact feature representations', 'Image classification']",,"Semi-supervised multi-view latent space learning is gaining considerable popularity recently in many machine learning applications due to the high cost and difficulty to obtain the large amount of label information of data.

To address the above issues, we propose an approach called semi-supervised multi-view manifold discriminant intact space learning (SM2DIS) for image classification in this paper. SM2DIS aims to seek a manifold discriminant intact space for data of different views by making use of both the discriminant information of labeled data and the manifold structure of both labeled and unlabeled data.

Feature Based Techniques for a Driver's Distraction Detection using Supervised Learning Algorithms based on Fixed Monocular Video Camera,2018,"['Distraction Detection', 'Safety Driving', 'Neural Network', 'Computer Vision', 'Driver Monitoring']",,"Most of the accidents occur due to drowsiness while driving, avoiding road signs and due to driver's distraction. Driver's distraction depends on various factors which include talking with passengers while driving, mood disorder, nervousness, anger, over-excitement, anxiety, loud music, illness, fatigue and different driver’s head rotations due to change in yaw, pitch and roll angle. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, a data set is generated for conducting different experiments on driver’s distraction. Secondly, novel approaches are presented that use features based on facial points; especially the features computed using motion vectors and interpolation to detect a special type of driver’s distraction, i.e., driver’s head rotation due to change in yaw angle. These facial points are detected by Active Shape Model (ASM) and Boosted Regression with Markov Networks (BoRMaN). Various types of classifiers are trained and tested on different frames to decide about a driver's distraction. These approaches are also scale invariant. The results show that the approach that uses the novel ideas of motion vectors and interpolation outperforms other approaches in detection of driver’s head rotation. We are able to achieve a percentage accuracy of 98.45 using Neural Network.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
Supervised-Learning-Aided Communication Framework for MIMO Systems With Low-Resolution ADCs,2018,,,"<P>This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output system with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In this system, we propose a novel communication framework that is inspired by supervised learning. The key idea of the proposed framework is to learn the nonlinear input–output system, formed by the concatenation of a wireless channel and a quantization function used at the ADCs for data detection. In this framework, a conventional channel estimation process is replaced by a system learning process, in which the conditional probability mass functions (PMFs) of the nonlinear system are empirically learned by sending the repetitions of all possible data signals as pilot signals. Then, the subsequent data detection process is performed based on the empirical conditional PMFs obtained during the system learning. To reduce both the training overhead and the detection complexity, we also develop a supervised-learning-aided successive-interference-cancellation method. In this method, a data signal vector is divided into two subvectors with reduced dimensions. Then, these two subvectors are successively detected based on the conditional PMFs that are learned using artificial noise signals and an estimated channel. For the case of 1-bit ADCs, we derive an analytical expression for the vector error rate of the proposed framework under perfect channel knowledge at the receiver. Simulations demonstrate the detection error reduction of the proposed framework compared to conventional detection techniques that are based on channel estimation.</P>",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Proposed approach uses semi-supervised deep hashing with semantic learning and binary code generation by minimizing the objective function. Convolutional autoencoders are basis to extract semantic features due to its property of image generation from low level semantic representations.

Deep BBN Learning for Health Assessment toward Decision-Making on Structures under Uncertainties,2018,"['deep learning', 'probabilistic learning', 'deep Bayesian belief network learning', 'structural condition assessment']",,"Structural systems are often exposed to harsh environment, while these environmental factors in turn could degrade the system over time. Their health state and structural conditions are key for structural safety control and decision-making management. Although great efforts have been paid on this field, the high level of variability due to noise and other interferences, and the uncertainties associated with data collection, structural performance and in-service operational environments post great challenges in finding information to assist decision making. The machine learning techniques in recent years have been gaining increasing attentions due to their merits capturing information from statistical representation of events and thus enabling making decision. In this study, the deep Bayesian Belief Network Learning (DBBN) was used to extract structural information and probabilistically determine structural conditions. Different to conventional shallow learning that highly relies on the quality of the hand-crafted features, the deep learning is an end-to-end method to encode the information and interpret vast amount of data with minimizing or no features. A case study was conducted to address the methods for structure under viabilities and uncertainties due to operation, damage and noise interferences. Numerical results revealed that the deep learning exhibits considerably enhanced accuracy for structural diagnostics, as compared to the supervised shallow learning. With predetermined training set, the DBBN could accurately determine the structural health state in terms of damage level, which could dramatically help decision making for further structural retrofit or not. Note that the noise interference could contaminate the data representation and in turn increase the difficulty of the data mining, though the deep learning could reduce the impacts, as compared to conventional shallow learning techniques.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

To overcome these challenges, this article presents a deep learning-based method with a new architecture of Stateful Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks (S-LSTM NN) for detecting sensor fault without going into details of the fault features. As LSTMs are capable of learning data features automatically, and the proposed method works without an accurate mathematical model. The detection of four types of sensor faults are studied in this paper. Non-stationary acceleration responses of a three-span continuous bridge when under operational conditions are studied. A deep network model is applied to the measured bridge data with estimation to detect the sensor fault. Another set of sensor output data is used to supervise the network parameters and backpropagation algorithm to fine tune the parameters to establish a deep self-coding network model. The response residuals between the true value and the predicted value of the deep S-LSTM network was statistically analyzed to determine the fault threshold of sensor. Experimental study with a cable-stayed bridge further indicated that the proposed method is robust in the detection of the sensor fault.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Binarization of degraded document images based on hierarchical deep supervised network,2018,"['Document image binarization', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Document analysis']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The binarization of degraded document images is a challenging problem in terms of document analysis. Binarization is a classification process in which intra-image pixels are assigned to either of the two following classes: foreground text and background. Most of the algorithms are constructed on low-level features in an unsupervised manner, and the consequent disenabling of full utilization of input-domain knowledge considerably limits distinguishing of background noises from the foreground. In this paper, a novel supervised-binarization method is proposed, in which a hierarchical deep supervised network (DSN) architecture is learned for the prediction of the text pixels at different feature levels. With higher-level features, the network can differentiate text pixels from background noises, whereby severe degradations that occur in document images can be managed. Alternatively, foreground maps that are predicted at lower-level features present a higher visual quality at the boundary area.

Thus, this study would utilize deep learning based on an artificial neural network to predict credit ratings relatively exactly based on the corporate financial information. In other words, this study designed a model for the prediction of credit ratings as a neural network consisting of an input layer, two hidden layers and an output layer and evaluated the model through 10-layer cross-validation.Since most preceding studies analyzing the correlation between corporate financial information and credit ratings presupposed the linearity between explanatory variables and dependent variables, there was a limitation for the model’s reflection of the complex real world. To overcome this limitation, this study presupposed a nonlinear activation function based on an artificial neural network and utilized deep learning based on a deep neural network with the increased number of hidden layers. According to the results of this study, the accuracy of the model for the prediction of credit ratings utilizing deep learning was much higher than the random prediction of credit ratings, and through this, it was proven that utilizing deep learning would be useful in predicting credit ratings.Reducing accounting information users’ investment risks through the accurate prediction of credit ratings allows efficient allocation of resources.

Deep Facial Age Estimation Using Conditional Multitask Learning With Weak Label Expansion,2018,,,"<P>Accurate age estimation from a facial image is quite challenging, since physical age and apparent age can be quite different, and this difference is dependent on gender, ethnicity, and many other factors. Multitask deep learning is one of the approach to improve age estimation by employing auxiliary tasks, such as gender recognition, that are related to the primary task. However, in traditional multitask learning for age estimation, the relationship between the primary and auxiliary tasks is difficult to describe; how the auxiliary tasks enhance the model for the primary objective is ambiguous. In this letter, we propose a conditional multitask learning method that architecturally factorizes an age variable into gender-conditioned age probabilities in a deep neural network. The lack of accurate training labels with discrete age values is another critical limitation to training age estimation models. Therefore, we propose a label expansion method that increases the number of accurate labels from weakly supervised categorical labels. To verify the generality of the proposed method, we perform intensive experiments on the publicly available MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets. The proposed methods outperform state-of-the art methods in both age estimation and gender recognition accuracy. These performance gains are verified on well-known deep network architectures—VGG-16, CASIA-WebFace, and Alexnet—to confirm the proposed methods generality.</P>",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
Minimally Supervised Relation Identification from Wikipedia Articles,2018,"['relation identification', 'Wikipedia mining', 'unsupervised clustering']",,"Wikipedia is composed of millions of articles, each of which explains a particular entity with various languages in the real world. Since the articles are contributed and edited by a large population of diverse experts with no specific authority, Wikipedia can be seen as a naturally occurring body of human knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify key entities and relations in Wikipedia articles, which can be used for automatic ontology construction. Compared to previous approaches to entity and relation extraction and/or identification from text, our goal is to capture naturally occurring entities and relations from Wikipedia while minimizing artificiality often introduced at the stages of constructing training and testing data. The titles of the articles and anchored phrases in their text are regarded as entities, and their types are automatically classified with minimal training. We attempt to automatically detect and identify possible relations among the entities based on clustering without training data, as opposed to the relation extraction approach that focuses on improvement of accuracy in selecting one of the several target relations for a given pair of entities. While the relation extraction approach with supervised learning requires a significant amount of annotation efforts for a predefined set of relations, our approach attempts to discover relations as they occur naturally. Unlike other unsupervised relation identification work where evaluation of automatically identified relations is done with the correct relations determined a priori by human judges, we attempted to evaluate appropriateness of the naturally occurring clusters of relations involving person-artifact and person-organization entities and their relation names.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

However, in order to solve the LRR problem, it is necessary to perform singular value decomposition on the square matrix of the number of data points for each iteration of the algorithm; hence the calculation is inefficient. To solve this problem, we propose an improved and faster LRR method based on the recently published Fast LRR (FaLRR) and suggests ways to introduce and optimize additional constraints on the underlying optimization goals in order to address the fact that the FaLRR is fast but actually poor in classification problems. Our experiments confirm that the proposed method finds a better solution than LRR does. We also propose Fast MLRR (FaMLRR), which shows better results when the goal of minimizing is added.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Collecting sufficient labeled data is an expensive and time-consuming task. To build a HAR system in a new environment (i.e., the target domain) with very limited labeled data, it is unfavorable to naively exploit the data or trained classifier model from the existing environment (i.e., the source domain) as it is due to the domain difference. While traditional machine learning approaches are unable to address such distribution mismatch, transfer learning approach leverages the utilization of knowledge from existing well-established source domains that help to build an accurate classifier in the target domain. In this work, we propose a transfer learning approach to create an accurate HAR classifier with very limited data through the multitask neural network. The classifier loss function minimization for source and target domain are treated as two different tasks. The knowledge transfer is performed by simultaneously minimizing the loss function of both tasks using a single neural network model. Furthermore, we utilize the unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner to help the model training. The experiment result shows that the proposed work consistently outperforms existing approaches.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Especially, the scale of E-commerce industry in which Amazon and E-bay are standing out is exploding in a large way. As E-commerce grows, Customers could get what they want to buy easily while comparing various products because more products have been registered at online shopping malls.However, a problem has arisen with the growth of E-commerce. As too many products have been registered, it has become difficult for customers to search what they really need in the flood of products.When customers search for desired products with a generalized keyword, too many products have come out as a result. On the contrary, few products have been searched if customers type in details of products because concrete product-attributes have been registered rarely.In this situation, recognizing texts in images automatically with a machine can be a solution. Because bulk of product details are written in catalogs as image format, most of product information are not searched with text inputs in the current text-based searching system. It means if information in images can be converted to text format, customers can search products with product-details, which make them shop more conveniently.There are various existing OCR(Optical Character Recognition) programs which can recognize texts in images. But existing OCR programs are hard to be applied to catalog because they have problems in recognizing texts in certain circumstances, like texts are not big enough or fonts are not consistent.Therefore, this research suggests the way to recognize keywords in catalog with the Deep Learning algorithm which is state of the art in image-recognition area from 2010s. Single Shot Multibox Detector(SSD), which is a credited model for object-detection performance, can be used with structures re-designed to take into account the difference of text from object. But there is an issue that SSD model needs a lot of labeled-train data to be trained, because of the characteristic of deep learning algorithms, that it should be trained by supervised-learning. To collect data, we can try labelling location and classification information to texts in catalog manually. But if data are collected manually, many problems would come up. Some keywords would be missed because human can make mistakes while labelling train data. And it becomes too time-consuming to collect train data considering the scale of data needed or costly if a lot of workers are hired to shorten the time. Furthermore, if some specific keywords are needed to be trained, searching images that have the words would be difficult, as well.To solve the data issue, this research developed a program which create train data automatically. This program can make images which have various keywords and pictures like catalog and save location-information of keywords at the same time. With this program, not only data can be collected efficiently, but also the performance of SSD model becomes better. The SSD model recorded 81.99% of recognition rate with 20,000 data created by the program.Moreover, this research had an efficiency test of SSD model according to data differences to analyze what feature of data exert influence upon the performance of recognizing texts in images. As a result, it is figured out that the number of labeled keywords, the addition of overlapped keyword label, the existence of keywords that is not labeled, the spaces among keywords and the differences of background images are related to the performance of SSD model. This test can lead performance improvement of SSD model or other text-recognizing machine based on deep learning algorithm with high-quality data.SSD model which is re-designed to recognize texts in images and the program developed for creating train data are expected to contribute to improvement of searching system in E-co...",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

An Oakeshottian solution to these crises consists of two aspects: one is to reexamine the nature of a university, and the other is to redefine its function and role in higher education. Firstly, the unique nature of a university is that it teaches students how to be a human being by examining and reflecting on their living circumstances. Human beings live in a world of meaning, and learning to understand and express these meanings is a necessary condition for being a man. Secondly, the university can be recognized as a place of conversation where freedom and imagination become the subject of students’ self-examination. Students in a conversation of this kind learn to recognize various voices, to identify their different modes of expression, and to develop the intellectual and moral habits that are suitable for this sort of conversational relationship. Thirdly, we points out the different roles that a university plays in the world of business and the world of liberal learning respectively by analyzing the relationship between university and society. Universities can neither rely too much on either side nor be completely detached from one side. Finally, we understand that what a university gives us is not a way of survival, but some conceptual knowledge about morality and emotion. The knowledge of this sort helps us more comprehensively to understand the world and ourselves. Oakeshott’s concept of a university in modern education plays an irreplaceable role for educational organizations and institutions, especially for parents and teachers, who guide and supervise students foster their moral characters of autocriticism, self-discipline and self-education in the process of liberal learning.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

However, for the first step, we build a big data set which consists of local real crime information and urban physicalor non-physical data. Then, we developed a crime prediction model through machine learning method. Finally, we assumed several possible scenarios and calculated the probability of crime and visualized the results in a map so as to increase the people's understanding. Among the factors affecting the crime occurrence revealed in previous and case studies, data was processed in the form of a big data for machine learning: real crime information, weather information (temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, sunshine, insolation, snowfall, cloud cover) and local information (average building coverage, average floor area ratio, average building height, number of buildings, average appraised land value, average area of residential building, average number of ground floor). Among the supervised machine learning algorithms, the decision tree model, the random forest model, and the SVM model, which are known to be powerful and accurate in various fields were utilized to construct crime prevention model. As a result, decision tree model with the lowest RMSE was selected as an optimal prediction model. Based on this model, several scenarios were set for theft and violence cases which are the most frequent in the case city J, and the probability of crime was estimated by 250x250m grid. As a result, we could find that the high crime risky area is occurring in three patterns in case city J. The probability of crime was divided into three classes and visualized in map by 250 x 250m grid.

In the modern East Asian history of thought, the beginning of the emergence of subjectivity and the silsim as the main philosophical topic comes from the Neo-Confucianism of Song Dynasty in China. Cheng Yi is the first thinker to emphasize subjectivity and consciousness. Zhu Xi and Wang Yang-ming inherit the Neo-Confucian thought based on Cheng Yi's principle of subjectivity, but only show difference in methodology. In the Chosun Dynasty, Jeong Je-Doo and his School were one example of the Neo-Confucian spirit of subjectivity and the silsim. Although Jeong In-Bo (鄭寅普) belongs to Jeong Je-Doo's school of Ganghwa in the school curriculum, he has only used it methodologically since he believed that Yangming's learning is more effective in the awareness and practice of the silsim. Especially noteworthy is that the principle of subjectivity led Jeong In-Bo to follow the frame of Zhu Xi's moral theory. Jeong's claim that selfish desire (jasasim 自私心) should be controlled by a conscious mind (silsim) being aware of the right and 'ought to do' corresponds to Zhu Xi's view that the moral mind (dosim 道心) should be selected in the conflict situation between sensual desire (insim 人心) and moral consciousness so that the insim should be supervised by the dosim. Such ethics is a position to emphasize the inner motive and the sense of duty of conduct, and there is no fundamental difference in Zhu Xi and Wang Yang-ming.

In this study, we propose story learning/regeneration frameworks from videos with successive event order supervision for contextual coherence. The supervision induces each episode to have a form of trajectory in the latent space, which constructs a composite representation of ordering and semantics. In this study, we incorporated the use of kids videos as a training data. Some of the advantages associated with the kids videos include omnibus style, simple/explicit storyline in short, chronological narrative order, and relatively limited number of characters and spatial environments. We build the encoder-decoder structure with successive event order embedding, and train bi-directional LSTMs as sequence models considering multi-step sequence prediction. Using a series of approximately 200 episodes of kids videos named ‘Pororo the Little Penguin’, we give empirical results for story regeneration tasks and SEOE. In addition, each episode shows a trajectory-like shape on the latent space of the model, which gives the geometric information for the sequence models.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

There have been growing concerns that the traditional specialty-based clerkship in fragmented and highly specialized clinical environments may not be the optimal choice for basic clinical education. As a result, a new model of clinical clerkship called longitudinal integrated clerkships (LICs) has emerged. There is increased interest in LICs due to the growing evidence of positive outcomes for students, patients, and supervising clinicians. Emphasizing continuity as one of the main organizing principles of an LIC, this article reviews the introduction of LICs into medical education, the key concepts and educational theories which underpin LICs, and the typology of LICs.

Binary Hashing CNN Features for Action Recognition,2018,"['Action Recognition', 'CNN Feature', 'Binary Hashing', 'Feature Normalization']",,"The purpose of this work is to solve the problem of representing an entire video using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features for human action recognition. Recently, due to insufficient GPU memory, it has been difficult to take the whole video as the input of the CNN for end-to-end learning. A typical method is to use sampled video frames as inputs and corresponding labels as supervision. One major issue of this popular approach is that the local samples may not contain the information indicated by the global labels and sufficient motion information. To address this issue, we propose a binary hashing method to enhance the local feature extractors. First, we extract the local features and aggregate them into global features using maximum/minimum pooling. Second, we use the binary hashing method to capture the motion features. Finally, we concatenate the hashing features with global features using different normalization methods to train the classifier. Experimental results on the JHMDB and MPII-Cooking datasets show that, for these new local features, binary hashing mapping on the sparsely sampled features led to significant performance improvements.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Those text data were produced and distributed through various media platforms such as World Wide Web, Internet news feeds, microblog, and social media. However, this enormous amount of easily obtained information is lack of organization. Therefore, this problem has raised the interest of many researchers in order to manage this huge amount of information. Further, this problem also required professionals that are capable of classifying relevant information and hence text classification is introduced. Text classification is a challenging task in modern data analysis, which it needs to assign a text document into one or more predefined categories or classes. In text classification field, there are different kinds of techniques available such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes Algorithm, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network.  However, while dealing with huge amount of text data, model performance and accuracy becomes a challenge. According to the type of words used in the corpus and type of features created for classification, the performance of a text classification model can be varied. Most of the attempts are been made based on proposing a new algorithm or modifying an existing algorithm. This kind of research can be said already reached their certain limitations for further improvements. In this study, aside from proposing a new algorithm or modifying the algorithm, we focus on searching a way to modify the use of data. It is widely known that classifier performance is influenced by the quality of training data upon which this classifier is built. The real world datasets in most of the time contain noise, or in other words noisy data, these can actually affect the decision made by the classifiers built from these data. In this study, we consider that the data from different domains, which is heterogeneous data might have the characteristics of noise which can be utilized in the classification process.  In order to build the classifier, machine learning algorithm is performed based on the assumption that the characteristics of training data and target data are the same or very similar to each other. However, in the case of unstructured data such as text, the features are determined according to the vocabularies included in the document. If the viewpoints of the learning data and target data are different, the features may be appearing different between these two data. In this study, we attempt to improve the classification accuracy by strengthening the robustness of the document classifier through artificially injecting the noise into the process of constructing the document classifier.  With data coming from various kind of sources, these data are likely formatted differently. These cause difficulties for traditional machine learning algorithms because they are not developed to recognize different type of data representation at one time and to put them together in same generalization. Therefore, in order to utilize heterogeneous data in the learning process of document classifier, we apply semi-supervised learning in our study. However, unlabeled data might have the possibility to degrade the performance of the document classifier. Therefore, we further proposed a method called Rule Selection-Based Ensemble Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithm (RSESLA) to select only the documents that contributing to the accuracy improvement of the classifier. RSESLA creates multiple views by manipulating the features using different types of classification models and different types of heterogeneous data. The most confident classification rules will be selected and applied for the final decision making. In this paper, three different types of real-world data sources were used, which are news, twitter and blogs.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Research on arousal and valence analysis, which uses images, texts, and physiological signals that employ deep learning, is actively underway; research investigating how to improve the recognition rate is needed. The goal of this research was to design a deep learning framework and model to classify arousal and valence, indicating positive and negative degrees of emotion as high or low. Methods: The proposed arousal and valence classification model to analyze the affective state was tested using data from 40 channels provided by a dataset for emotion analysis using electrocardiography (EEG), physiological, and video signals (the DEAP dataset). Experiments were based on 10 selected featured central and peripheral nervous system data points, using long short-term memory (LSTM) as a deep learning method. Results: The arousal and valence were classified and visualized on a two-dimensional coordinate plane. Profiles were designed depending on the number of hidden layers, nodes, and hyperparameters according to the error rate. The experimental results show an arousal and valence classification model accuracy of 74.65 and 78%, respectively.The proposed model performed better than previous other models.

From the perspective of interdisciplinary research, this study aims to analyze new forms of art creation from the convergence of human creativity and artificial intelligence (hereafter A.I.), based on A.I. learning models and participation forms of viewer through the case studies and literature review. In addition, it contributes to shed light on the meanings of art creations using A.I. in terms of convergence research.  The interactive artworks based on A.I. discussed in this study have given new meaning to the role of spectators in art creation by turning viewers into participant as well as co-creator. Also, it ultimately let people reflect upon the relationship between human and A.I. On the other hand, in the case of non-interactive creative artworks based on A.I., machine learning was used to interpret image’s features to its own unique way and create into new images. Especially in the case of some creations, the creations augmented the interest in the value of artistic creations made by A.I..  In conclusion, because artistic creations created through the convergence of human beings and A.I. can interpret and express data in a way that differ from human beings, it opens up new horizons of the convergence of art and technology for creators to innovate through new creative materials and creative methods and gives visitors a new opportunity to experience visual images.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

In this study, a total of 14 events of meteo-tsunami over 11 years (2006-2016) are selected through analyzing sea-level data observed from tidal stations along the west coast of the Korean peninsula. The propagation velocity and direction are calculated by tracing the atmospheric disturbance of each meteo-tsunami event predicted by the WRF model. Then, the Froude number is calculated using the propagation velocity of atmospheric waves and oceanic long waves from bathymetry data. To derive the critical condition for the occurrence of meteo-tsunami, supervised learning using a logistic regression algorithm is conducted. It is concluded that the threshold distance of meteo-tsunami occurrence, from a propagation direction, can be calculated by the amplitude of air-pressure tendency and the resonance factor, which are found using the Froude number. According to the critical condition, the distance increases logarithmically with the ratio of the amplitude of air-pressure tendency and the square of the resonance factor, and meteo-tsunami do not occur when the ratio is less than 5.11 hPa/10 min.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

A large number of Open IE approaches have been proposed in the last decade, and the majority of these approaches are based on supervised learning or dependency parsing. In this paper, we present a novel method for web scale open information extraction, which employs cosine distance based on Google word vector as the confidence score of the extraction. The proposed method is a purely unsupervised learning algorithm without requiring any hand-labeled training data or dependency parse features. We also present the mathematically rigorous proof for the new method with Bayes Inference and Artificial Neural Network theory. It turns out that the proposed algorithm is equivalent to Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the joint probability distribution over the elements of the candidate extraction. The proof itself also theoretically suggests a typical usage of word vector for other NLP tasks. Experiments show that the distance-based method leads to further improvements over the newly presented Open IE systems on three benchmark datasets, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

First, L<sub>2,1</sub> norm regularization can promote the projection matrix row-sparsity, which makes the feature selection and subspace learning simultaneously. Second, uncorrelated features of minimum redundancy are effective for classification. We define 2D statistically uncorrelated model that each row (or column) are independent. Third, we provide a feasible solution by transforming the proposed L<sub>2,1</sub> nonlinear model into a linear regression type. Additionally, 2DSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub> is extended to a bilateral projection version called BSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub>.

As this trend affected the new education in the same period, the education for western sciences was added besides the foreign language education in Tongwen Guan(foreing language college), and various technical schools were set up.Technical schools were built especially to train and rear technical experts for the basic industries of state like ship-building, electric wire, rail road, mine and medical science. The education in the technical school of this period had some important characteristics.First, if though there was diversification in the field of technical education, it was not clearly divided according to military purpose or civilian purpose. Even though one among two purposes was considered more important in a school, the other aim was never excluded completely.Attaching a Rail-road school to Nanjing Military School in 1896, Zhang Zhidong said, A railroad is closely connected not only with the national interest but the military affair of the state., which is a good evidence. Though Northern Medical School(Tianjin Medical School) was primarily a military medical school established for military sake, treatment for civilians was never ignored. It was at first established to cope with military demand in the national emergency, but in reality tended to take care of civilian patients more and more.Technical schools, in fact most of Yangwu schools, had the nature of foreign language school as one outstanding characteristic, as the Front School of Fujian Ship Administration School was called the French School, and the Rear School as The English School. Because proper Chinese words for the modern scientific & technological terms were not established yet and its education had to depend on the western teachers, they should learn foreign languages first. Consequently they preferred the children who had studied western languages in Shanghai, Hongkong and Guangjou for years in technical schools.Though Zhang Zhidong emphasized the Chinese traditional learning as an educational element, it had just the meaning of proclamation, which sometimes impeded the development of Yangwu schools. Most of the schools were financially pressed due to the high wages of western teachers, which as a result hindered the extension and the establishment of Yangwu schools.Another important feature of technical schools was that they supplied for the students not only inhabitation and food but paid living expenses and prize money depending on their achievements in examinations. This policy was a desperate attempt to attract students to overcome peoples' hostility on the western schools. It resulted in the situation that schools were filled with low-levelled poor students aiming at the government supply, which again obstructed the development in long term light. Students were forced extremely restrictive and complex rules and suffered from the oppressive atmosphere of school. Restrictions and incentives were exchanged.The number and scale of technical schools were trivial at first, compared with the size and population of China, but increased and extended gradually. For example, Shanghai Telegraph School started with 20 students in 1882, but the students' number increased to 300 in 1891, which was caused by the increase in the demand for the telegraph. Railroad school started later than telegraph school, which was the reflection of the Chinese peoples' resistance against the construction of railroad.The alumni of Yangwu schools played significant roles for the society as well as made personal success, on the basis of new knowledge and skills in drastically changing China, though they had been looked upon as heretics in the traditional society. Yian Fu(嚴復) who had entered fabrication major in Fujian Ship Administration School as a top talented student among the first term students became the president of Tianjin Navy School, after studying in England Navy School. Shen Yuch'ing(沈瑜慶) and Jiang Chaoying(蔣超英) became the president of Nanjing Navy School later, some others took the president of Guangdong Navy School. Before 1911 Revolution the alumni who majored in fabrication were 143 for 7 terms, those who majored in navigation 241 for 17 terms, and those who majored in engineer 126 for 11 terms. These total 510 alumni made a tremendous contribution to the warship building and the development of the navy in modern China, though at the same time they left a harmful effect on politics by organizing a closed group called Mintang(閩黨)in the bureaucracy. And Tinjin Medical School produced 218 army doctors for 37 years until 1933. Other technical experts who graduated from different technical schools must have opened their new futures on the basis of their knowledge and technologies learned in the school, leaving significant achievements in modern China.",supervised_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

This new and increasingly evolving technology, especially ICT, can not be confident in its effectiveness and safety, so it need to be allowed within the bounds of a pre-determined. In this regard, regulatory sandboxing is a regulatory technique that coincides with the incentives of companies, consumers, and supervisory agencies. Therefore, it is meaningful as an attempt in the field of financial supervision policy to cope with the current rapid changes in information and communication technology.Recently, in Korea, legislation introducing regulated sandboxes has been proposed to the National Assembly. In this paper, I review the system and main contents of the regulation of sandbox in the context of Special Law on Financial Innovation Support. In this paper, I propose some improvements after analyzing and reviewing the contents comparing with the case of foreign countries from the viewpoint of law to increase competition and efficiency between industries and increase the convenience of consumers.First of all, it is the capacity and role of the supervisory authority that is most important in the use of the regulatory sandbox. If the regulatory paradigm shifts from the conventional regulation to the ex-post regulation, the supervision of the administrative supervision agency alone has little effect on the damage of the consumers. Therefore, smart strategic regulatory operation is necessary. In other words, it is desirable to allow actual market launch only in a small scale, and it is desirable to expand the scale to the entire industry by increasing the size of the system, if it is confirmed that the risk is monitored in real time for a certain period of time and the damage prevention device can be quickly detected.Second, through testing, both companies and financial supervisory organization are collecting vivid evidence on regulatory reforms and various information obtained during the test implementation process. The regulatory sandbox allows companies, users, and supervisory agencies to learn from each other, and its effects are very useful for setting and agreeing codes of conduct in today's rapidly changing society.Third, it needs to be complemented by RegTech. As the development of ICT technology, related regulations are likely to be preemptive and complicated for financial consumer protection and supervision enhancement is expected. As it becomes increasingly difficult for regulators to prepare and respond to new risks from new technologies developments, both FinTech and regulatory authorities need to leverage technology in relation to regulation.Finally, it is necessary to prepare measures to prevent and relieve more rapidly in case of the possibility of (mass) consumer disputes due to rapid technological change.

A pair of TCR and peptide sequences correspond to the input for ANNs, while the success or failure of the immunological recognition correspond to the output. The output is obtained by both theoretical model and experimental data. In either case, we confirmed that ANNs could learn the immuno- logical recognition.

In particular, gesture recognition and dailyactivity recognition have attracted the interest of numerous researchers. Human motions have been predicted by analyzing accelerometer data from which features were extracted to be classified into a specific activity. However, due to the memory limitations of IoT devices, it is hard to utilize all the raw data from an accelerometer sensor. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to recognize human arm movements using a commercial wearable device, the Myo armband. Agents learn the patterns that are the acceleration data of human motion. In addition, using raw accelerometer sensor data without feature extraction could make an end-to-end structure. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, a deep neural network (DNN) and a deep reinforcement learning algorithm are compared. As a result, a deep reinforcement learning agent yielded accuracy similar to a DNN using less data, and the agent could learn time-series human motion acceleration data.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Q-learning is an effective scheme for unknown dynamical systems because it does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics to solve optimal control problems. By applying the MGPI concept, which is an extension of basic GPI with multirate time horizon steps, a new Q-learning algorithm is proposed for solving the LQR problem. Further, it is proven that the proposed algorithm converges to an optimal solution i.e., it learns the optimal control policy iteratively using the states and the control-input information.

Post-CCA and Reinforcement Learning Based Bandwidth Adaptation in 802.11ac Networks,2018,,,"<P>The new 802.11ac standard aims at achieving Gbps data throughput for individual users by exploiting enhanced physical-layer features, such as higher modulation levels, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), and wider bandwidths. However, the heterogeneity of bandwidth in a network can cause asymmetric interferences in which certain transmissions cannot be sensed by some other nodes. As a result, the conventional Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) may not work well in 802.11ac networks. We call this the <I>Hidden Channel</I> (HC) problem, which is shown to be <I>real</I> via experiments with USRP and WARP boards. To solve this problem, we propose bandwidth adaptation based on <I>post-CCA</I>, which is a clear channel assessment (CCA) procedure performed <I>after</I> completing a transmission. Post-CCA in wireless networks helps mimic the CSMA with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) mechanism in the wired Ethernet, thus enhancing channel assessment capability. Using post-CCA, we propose Post-CCA based Bandwidth Adaptation (PoBA) that alters bandwidth and channel configuration dynamically by applying a reinforcement learning mechanism. Post-CCA and PoBA do not require any hardware modification and are also compliant with the 802.11 standards.

In particular, passengers on cruise ships are untrained and varied, making evacuation prospects worse. In such a case, the evacuation management of the crew plays a very important role. If a rescuer enters a ship at distress and conducts rescue activities, which zones represent the most effective entry should be examined. Generally, crew and rescuers take the shortest route, but if an accident occurs along the shortest route, it is necessary to select the second-best alternative. To solve this situation, this study aims to calculate evacuation routes using Q-Learning of Reinforcement Learning, which is a machine learning technique. Reinforcement learning is one of the most important functions of artificial intelligence and is currently used in many fields. Most evacuation analysis programs developed so far use the shortest path search method. For this reason, this study explored optimal paths using reinforcement learning. In the future, machine learning techniques will be applicable to various marine-related industries for such purposes as the selection of optimal routes for autonomous vessels and risk avoidance.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Neural responsiveness to social reinforcements during instrumental learning, despite the importance of this for socialization, has not yet been previously investigated.Methods: Twenty-nine healthy children/adolescents and 19 children/adolescents with DBDs performed the fMRI social/ non-social reinforcement learning task. Participants responded to random fractal image stimuli and received social and non-social rewards/non-rewards according to their accuracy.Results: Children/adolescents with DBDs showed significantly reduced responses within the caudate and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to non-social (financial) rewards and social non-rewards (the distress of others). Connectivity analyses revealed that children/adolescents with DBDs have decreased positive functional connectivity between the ventral striatum (VST) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) seeds and the lateral frontal cortex in response to reward relative to non-reward, irrespective of its sociality. In addition, they showed decreased positive connectivity between the vmPFC seed and the amygdala in response to non-reward relative to reward.Conclusion: These data indicate compromised reinforcement processing of both non-social rewards and social non-rewards in children/adolescents with DBDs within core regions for instrumental learning and reinforcement-based decision- making (caudate and PCC). In addition, children/adolescents with DBDs show dysfunctional interactions between the VST, vmPFC, and lateral frontal cortex in response to rewarded instrumental actions potentially reflecting disruptions in attention to rewarded stimuli.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Design of Reinforced Interval Type-2 Fuzzy C-Means-Based Fuzzy Classifier,2018,,,"<P>This paper is concerned with a new design methodology of a reinforced interval type-2 fuzzy c-means (FCM) based fuzzy classifier (FC). The key point of this study is to reduce the computational complexity of type-2 fuzzy set-based models and to alleviate the deterioration of its generalization abilities through the synergistic effect of two algorithms: First, interval type-2 FCM (IT2FCM) is used in the hidden layer of the network and connections (weights) are adjusted by invoking the least squares error estimation method. Second, an L<SUB>2</SUB>-norm regularization is considered in the cost function to avoid the construction of the network suffering from overfitting. In more detail, the hidden layer of the proposed FC is realized by interval type-2 FCM clustering to deal with the factor of uncertainty involved in the problem. This type of clustering is realized by using two values of the fuzzification coefficient resulting in the interval type-2 membership functions. Once completing type reduction, the membership grades of IT2FCM are used as the outputs of the hidden layer. Instead of the backpropagation training, least squares estimator based learning is applied to adjust the functional connection being regarded as linear functions mapping the hidden layer to the output layer. In order to reduce potential overfitting, L<SUB>2</SUB>-norm regularization is taken into account. The effectiveness of the proposed classifier is analyzed with the aid of a number of machine learning datasets as well as face image datasets.

Although history classes do not address identity issues, identity serves as a basis for students to understand and appreciate history. History education should contribute to the development of identities that reduce bias among conflict groups and connect one another, beyond its conventional role, cultivating the identity of large groups such as nations, ethnic groups, and religions. Recognizing the world with the eyes of a single identity of one certain group is a fundamental cause of conflict and violence, as can be seen through terrorism and war that arises from one religious standard that divides the world.There are three goals in the inquiry-based learning that explores the process of changing and shaping an individual's identity, beyond the development of group identity. First, students should be aware that individuals in a community have diversity, without thinking that people in the past had the same values ​​and mindset. It will help cultivate the citizenship in a pluralistic and democratic society. Next, students should be able to better understand the context and meaning of the macroscopic theme based on a detailed inquiry into the smaller subject of individuals. It will allow them to identify historical facts that are excluded or distorted from historically important themes due to the authority of “official history” and “simplification and reduction” of learning. The final goal of this learning is to let the students empathize with the individuals they meet in the learning and further acknowledge the dynamic relationship between individuals, groups, and structures. Consequently, students will realize that their lives and social changes are not irrelevant, which increases the likelihood of students' social involvement.Even if a particular social identity created by the group to which we belong promotes conflict and violence, it is difficult to completely eliminate them. However, we can mitigate the problem by recognizing and reinforcing “alternative identities” that compete with the problematic identities. In history education, it is necessary to strive to find and form an identity that plays a role of ‘bridge’ that connects them and us, not to emphasize the identity that distinguishes us from them. Through the process of exploring the diverse identities in the past, students can find themselves experiencing the connection with others. This effort will promote understanding of others as well as oneself, as opposed to attempting to narrow the identity, and will make the society a little more peaceful. In the case of the history of the Korean independence movement presented above as an example, it can be seen from the responses of the students that instead of highlighting the greatness of the independence activists, finding shared points between the activists and the students can rather encourage their contribution and engagement in a community.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Methods: Twelve young adults (19.63±2.11 years, 6 males and 6 females) practiced a dynamic force task with ankle dorsiflexion (acquisition phase; 50 trials) and then performed the transfer task (memory task; 10 trials). We quantified the force accuracy with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the participant""s raw force output relative to the target during the practice and transfer periods. Results: The change in force accuracy during error-based learning phase was not related to force accuracy during the transfer task (R² = 0.06; P > 0.4). The trial-to-trial variability in force accuracy during reinforcement phase was significantly associated with force accuracy during the transfer task (R² = 0.61; DW = 2.64; P < 0.01).

The purpose of this study lies in examining aspects of his philosophy that are more clearly highlighted when viewed through a Neo-Confucian reading and reviewing his critical problematics. In my view, just as Ch'oe's thought clearly cannot be simply reduced to or converged into modern Western learning, it cannot possibly be understood in complete severance from the traditional learning of the Choson Dynasty, or Neo-Confucianism. This is because the establishment of universal learning encompassing both the East and the West, or the establishment of a new unified discipline connecting the learning and thought of the East and the West was the goal of Ch'oe's philosophy. Even if to use Western learning in a manner suited to the framework of his thought, Ch'oe inevitably would have had to presume intellectual discernment differing from that of the West. I reviewed the shared intellectual grammar premised by Ch'oe's thought and Neo-Confucianism with a focus on the following points of contention. First, by distinguishing between the positions of the active energy of all nature 運化氣(yunhuaqi)[天命之性] and the energy of individual physical forms 形質氣 (xingzhiqi)[氣質之性], he distinguished between the two levels of energy 氣(qi). Second, Ch'oe modified the theory of the whole being-function 體用 (tiyonglun) based on the traditional 理(li) 氣(qi) of Neo-Confucianism and reinterpreted it as the theory of whole being-function of the active energy of all nature 氣之體用. Third, he acknowledged the study of the transcendence which adopted the spiritual energy 神氣(shenqi) limited to individuals' physical forms 形質(xingzhi) and made it accord with the energy of all nature, and, furthermore, established accord between heaven and humans 天人一致 and the unity of all people 萬姓一體 as the goals of the theory of cultivation 修養. In addition, he presumed that changes in not only awareness but also the self [self-cultivation 修身] and others [observation of people 相人] were important effects of study by epistemic examination 推測(tuice). Such points of contention are issues that invariably must be scrutinized within their relationships to Neo-Confucianism, the traditional learning of Choson. Although Ch'oe stressed both Confucianism and its norms, he nevertheless did not establish rebuilding Confucianism during the latter half of the Choson Dynasty as the goal of his studies. Ch'oe aimed at a universal, unified discipline that would encompass the East and the West instead of creating or reinforcing a gradation or a hierarchy in the relationship between China and Korea or between the West and the East. Consequently, Ch'oe's philosophy inevitably distanced itself from not only Neo-Confucianism but also Western Learning 西學 and, conversely, was able to obtain valid intellectual cues as much from Neo-Confucianism, the country's traditional learning, as from Western Learning.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Nowadays it creates something new. Just a few years ago, artificial intelligence would not have thought of composing and drawing pictures by itself. Smart artificial intelligence produces works similar to human beings in the fields of  music and art, which were estimated as human’s creative area. Artificial intelligence even plays a role in the development of new drugs and computer programs. The paper starts from the question whether artificial intelligence should be regarded as a human tool or artifacts of artificial intelligence should be treated as protected inventions under the patent law.  Thus the paper focuses on the artifacts produced by artificial intelligence and how to protect them. Unlike the protection by copyright law, there would be considerable controversy about the claim that artifacts of artificial intelligence should be protected by patent law. Nevertheless the author intends to insist the necessity of protection because artificial intelligence may have meaningful legal impact. The pace of technological progress is much quicker than that had been in the past. However laws have a tendency of coping with the phenomenon slowly. The author wish to share results through the promotion of science and technology with my contemporaries.  The paper briefly reviewed technical features of artificial intelligence. In particular the author reviewed the operating principles of AlphaGo Zero, which can create a new way without human intervention through reinforcement learning. In the case of artificial intelligence, the creation of artworks without any human intervention is likely to correspond to the conceptual invention of Article 2 (1) of the patent law. Artificial intelligence can create new outcomes through self-learning, as seen in the use of artificial intelligence in the pharmaceutical industry and computer programs. There are two results that could be considered meaningful in the process of artificial intelligence. First, the ability of processing data in aspects of time and amount of data. It is superior than general computers due to self-learning. Second, some unpredicted unique results through its self-learning process. The first result may be difficult to be a meaningful invention under the patent law. However,  the second result may not be handled just as a tool. It is difficult to say that it is a natural phenomenon. If so, the result of artificial intelligence could be protected as inventions under the patent law. Considering the possibility of artificial intelligence technology being used in industries, the paper tried to think about how to look at artificial intelligence output. The author examined whether the patent law could be applied to artifacts of artificial intelligence. Therefore the author reviewed  artificial intelligence related technologies in detail and reviewed the concept of the invention focused on the United States. After that, the author examined whether the concept of invention could be applied to the case of artificial intelligence products that are thought to be meaningful as inventions.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm achieves more than 9 Gbps of user throughput with a guaranteed probability of 90%, whereas the baselines guarantee less than 7.5 Gbps.

First, it should be transformed into a way that the government should become an operating entity, develop and provide quality programs to schools from one in which individual schools operate programs themselves or on commission. Second, it should provide educational alternatives that allow students to learn more about participation and experience unlike traditional classes. In other words, it is necessary to supplement the limitations of regular classes by developing a model for English education based on Culports (Culture+Sports) combining play, culture and learning.

This requires a mid- to long-term policy vision for after-school English education and a sophisticated implementation plan to implement it. The current study argues that the publicity of after-school English education should be reinforced in the way it absorbs private needs for English education.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
Hierarchical Cloud Computing Architecture for Context-Aware IoT Services,2018,,,"<P>This paper presents a new cloud computing model for context-aware Internet of Things services. The proposed computing model is hierarchically composed of two layers: a cloud control layer (CCL) and a user control layer (UCL). The CCL manages cloud resource allocation, service scheduling, service profile, and service adaptation policy from a system performance point of view. Meanwhile, the UCL manages end-to-end service connection and service context from a user performance point of view. The proposed model can support nonuniform service binding and its real-time adaptation using meta-objects. Furthermore, it supports intelligent service-context management using a supervised and reinforcement learning-based machine learning framework. We implemented a lightweight prototype of the proposed computing model. Evaluations confirm that the proposed computing model offers enhanced performance compared with legacy uniform computing models.</P>",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Most of the foreign learners do not have substantial college Scholastic Ability. A method to increase the Korean language ability of foreign students is becoming a major issue. Especially, the way to enhance the ability of academic purpose writing for evaluation purposes becomes a very important topic for the person in charge of teaching Korean language at university. In this reason, this study aims to provide a model of content-centered writing education using visual materials in writing education for foreign students. And I applied it to the class in S university and see if the model is efficient. Two discussion tasks were included in presenting the teaching - learning model. First, this study suggests how to activate the learner's schema using visual data instead of teacher’s direct suggestion about target knowledge in the second stage of the fourth stage of the lesson. Second, this study reinforces ‘confirmation stage’through rewriting instead of granting the exercise assignment in order for the learner’s scheme to be extended into writing knowledge. After this, this model induced the learner to select the extended writing knowledge strategically to derive the result in the task execution stage. A case study was conducted for freshmen students of S university’s foreign students in order to discuss the effects of learning. As a result, it has been verified that the activation of the schema using the visual data helps the learner to expand the knowledge of writing. In addition, it was confirmed that the learner can strategically select and apply writing knowledge to actively derive his writing results through the learning model presented here.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

To meet the demand and provide enhanced Quality of Experience (QoE) with mobile users, the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) has been actively studied to achieve QoE enhanced video streaming service in dynamic network environments. However, the existing DASH algorithm to select the quality of requesting video segments is based on a procedural algorithm so that it reveals a limitation to adapt its performance to dynamic network situations. To overcome this limitation this paper proposes a novel quality selection mechanism based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model, the DQN-based DASH ABR(DQNABR) mechanism. The DQNABR mechanism replaces the existing DASH ABR algorithm with an intelligent deep learning model which optimizes service quality to mobile users through reinforcement learning.

Recently, a deep Q-network (DQN), which is a combination of deep learning and Q-learning theory, has attracted attention as a reinforcement learning algorithm. It is used to train the robot to recognize obstacles and avoid collisions while it is moving toward a designated destination. However, the existing DQN method can handle only discrete tasks and low-dimensional spaces, meaning it is not suitable for continuous, especially the control of mobile robots. In addition, the existing LiDAR sensor method uses distance as the input for learning, with the system determining the next action based only on the distance from the mobile robot to the obstacle. In this process, due to the frequent fluctuation in the action values, unnatural acceleration/deceleration actions are required, which leads to physical shocks to the robot and low driving power efficiency. In this paper, this problem is solved by applying a replay buffer to store the output of the network. That is, the action values are stored in the memory and fed back as input again following the action order of the network. Experiments are carried out on an actual robot after reinforcement learning in ROS-GAZEBO simulations and the validity of the algorithm is verified through an analysis of the experimental data.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Each module is studied for decision making on lane changes and for securing safety through reinforcement learning using a deep learning technique. The autonomous mobile moving body operating to change the driving state has a characteristic where the next operation of the mobile body can be determined only if the definition of the speed determination model (according to its functions) and the lane change decision are correctly preceded. Also, if all the moving bodies traveling on a general road are equipped with an autonomous driving function, it is difficult to consider the factors that may occur between each mobile unit from unexpected environmental changes. Considering these factors, we applied the decision model to the platform and studied the lane change decision system for implementation of the platform.

The existing reinforcement learning algorithm is a model-free method that focuses on maximizing the expectation of the reward, and the adaptation speed is slow because it empirically learns the uncertainty of the environment. In contrast, the model-based method that learns the environmental model can adapt quickly to changes in the environment by applying the simulation results to the expectation reward. In this paper, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning method that finds a strategy that maximizes the expectation of reward based on the on-line learning of the probability transition model of the environment, simulates the scenario probabilistically using the learned model. We implemented the dynamic environment containing uncertainty using FrozenLake simulator of OpenAI and compared the performance of the proposed model with the existing method in various aspects.

Forty papers were coded and analyzed by the established coding framework in four dimensions: (a) basic publication information, (b) learning context, (c) learning mechanism, and (d) learning benefits. Overall, the results show that tangible technology has been used more for young learners in the kindergarten and primary school contexts mainly for science learning, to achieve both cognitive and affective learning outcomes, by coupling tangible objects with tabletops and desktop computers. From the synthesis of the review findings, this study suggests that the affordances of tangible technology useful for learning include embodied interaction, physical manipulations, and the physical-digital representational mapping. With such technical affordances, tangible technologies have the great potential in three particular areas in education: (a) learning spatial relationships, (b) making the invisible visible, and (c) reinforcing abstract concepts through the correspondence of representations.

In this paper we apply deep reinforcement learning to the problem of forming long-term driving. More specifically, we use deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms, termed actor- critic algorithm. A reward function promoting longitudinal velocity, while penalizing transverse velocity and divergence from the track center, is used to train multi-agents. The actor-critic algorithm was trained and evaluated in a synthetic environment.

For this, a machine learning approach called an Adaptive Support Vector Machine (ASVM) together with the limit equilibrium method were introduced to minimize the iteration numbers during the classification training of the tunnel stability. The proposed method was compared with the results of typical Monte Carlo simulations. It was concluded that the ASVM was very efficient and accurate to calculate the probability of failure having auxiliary umbrella arches and uncertain material properties of the tunnel.

First, the applications of BSC to the social welfare organizations show the potentials as the systems of performance management and strategic organizational administration.Second, the applications of BSC are expected to contribute to the evolution of the social welfare organizations into learning organizations.Third, BSC can be used as the effective communication vehicles among the inside of the organizations enabling appropriate monitoring and directions toward the specific activity goals under the common understanding of the objective of the organizations. Forth, the practice of BSC as a means of performance management facilitates active involvement in the communication and information sharing with resource providers.The suggestions based on the results of this study are like this. First, according to Kaplan and Norton, ‘the failures of the strategy occur in the process of performances rather than the stage of the establishment.’ The management of performance in BSC should be implemented through clarification of the organizational visions and strategies, and the balance of the ordinary tasks and the goals of the strategies. The importance of monitoring should not be neglected in that constant accomplishment of the performance is followed by monitoring the consistency in the process of goal achievement of individuals and the organization, the revision of the problems, decision making through the participation and teamwork. Second, the necessity of developing systems to reinforce the workers’ abilities and the learning organizations remains when managing the social welfare organizations with stable strategies. The administration of the organizations of social welfare depends on the abilities of the workers. Human resource development is the key factor of the satisfaction of the consumers and the contribution to the local communities. In that way, the social welfare organizations need to make all the workers recognize the facts that the stabilization of the management is accomplished by the results of the efforts to reach the direction points of the whole organization with the all members’ responsibilities and the visions for the future. An essential condition to cope with the dramatic change of the outside circumstances is the development of the learning culture of the organizations and the maintenance of the systems to consolidate individual capabilities. Third, in the aspect of the fact that the strategic management system of BSC is the administrative means to achieve the improvement of organizational assignments and promote the performances, the attention and support of the management is crucial. As this study shows, the crucial factors of the successful performance of BSC are the organizations and personnel taking full responsibilities of BSC, the development of expertise, and active participations with organizational support of the management",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

The class was operated by adopting the method of co-teaching lecturing, where two lecturers, one majoring in humanities and the other majoring in musical education, jointly developed and designed the course curriculum and led the class by converging and integrating the lesson contents into one lesson. As a result, students could approach the two fields of music and humanities through balanced fusion lesson contents. This was a departure from the traditional teaching method for liberal arts classes, where one lecturer focuses on one field of study, and, consequently, the two lecturers could broaden their understanding of other academic areas and widen the scope of their research viewpoints. In addition, they were able to pioneer a new method for academic research by introducing other fields or majors into their own research area. Consequently, this study is expected to lay the foundation upon which liberal arts courses at universities can contribute toward cultivating creative talents in the future and aims to serve as a starting point for the development of fusion liberal arts education.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

This study was conducted to investigate whether a clinical practice examination (CPX) preparation program improves students’ CPX score in terms of case specificity.Methods: One hundred and thirteen senior students in a medical school participated in this study. During the fourth-year clerkship, 28 students (24.8%) from three rotation groups took a 3-day CPX preparation course consist-ing of module development, role play, and comprehensive physical exam skills training. Eleven rotation groups (n=85) were compared as control. Both the intervention and control group took two comprehensive CPXs before and after the clerkship was completed.Results: There was no significant difference in age, sex, and school type between the two groups. On pre-test CPX, there was no significant difference in total and sectional scores between the two groups. On post-test CPX, total scores of the intervention group were higher than those of the control groups (69.5±4.3 vs. 67.5±4.4, P<0.05). History taking scores were higher in intervention groups (70.0±6.0 vs. 66.0±6.6, P=0.01). The station scores of vaginal dis-charge with case similarity were higher in the intervention groups (73.0±6.3 vs. 68.9±9.3, P=0.03).Conclusion: A short CPX preparation course improved history taking ability, but its effect was greater only in a spe-cific case, similar to the pre-course case. Whether this effect was due to the test experience or true improvement in competency requires further investigation.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

The significance of their presence in Chosŏn, however, waned with the weakening of this ideology and the rise of Northern Learning in the nineteenth century. Under these adverse circumstances, the Ming loyalist families in the early nineteenth century employed various strategies to re-emphasize Ming loyalism and consolidate their Ming loyalist identity; an initiative they viewed as critical in justifying their presence in Chosŏn society. This article traces the variety of these identity-reinforcing efforts by the Ming loyalist families, ranging from shrine-building and compilation efforts to intermarriage. It focuses on the ritual structures built in Chojong’am by these descendants and analyzes how the symbols of Ming loyalism embedded in this place by the Chosŏn literati in the seventeenth century were manipulated by Ming descendants in the early nineteenth century. Through these initiatives, the descendants asserted a new version of Ming loyalism that not only potentially undermined the claims of the Chosŏn court/literati to be the inheritors of Ming culture but strengthened the symbolic significance of the Ming loyalist families. This study illuminates this implicit tension and disjuncture between the positions of the two parties, which is significant for understanding developments, rather than seeing the Ming loyalists’ activities as an outcome of ongoing cooperative interactions between the Chosŏn court and the Ming families nourished during the eighteenth century.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

The Application of Early Childhood Professional Teaching Standards in the U.S.: A Comparative Study of a Preschool and an Elementary School Teacher,2018,"['early childhood generalist', 'Developmentally Appropriate Practices', 'National Board Certification']",,"Although interpreting and applying the professional teaching standards is a complex and active cognitive process influenced by teachers’ knowledge and teaching context, there is a lack of in-depth research into how early childhood teachers’ cognition impacts the way teachers change their beliefs and practices. With a cognitive framework, this study focuses on a preschool teacher and an elementary school teacher’s changing beliefs and practices as they apply Early Childhood Generalist(EC-GEN) Standards during and after the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards(NBPTS) process. The findings from a qualitative comparative study suggest that EC-GEN Standards guided teachers to reflect on child-directed learning, personalized, more meaningful and intentional teaching. Additionally, there were several similarities and differences in how teachers make sense of the EC-GEN Standards by grade/age levels due to their different approaches to teaching. Implications for reinforcing teachers’ professional development and utilizing professional teaching standards as a linkage for Pre-K to grade 3 continuities are discussed.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

1920∼1930년대 식민지 조선의 여성 개념과 젠더 — 부정적 기표 ‘계집’과 구여성을 중심으로 —,2018,"['여성', '여성 혐오', '비하어', '계집', '구여성', 'women', 'misogyny', 'insulting terms', 'gyejib', 'old-fashioned woman']","본고는 근대한국의 여성 개념을 분석하려는 작업의 일환으로, 20세기 전반에 간행된 주요 잡지들에서 ‘계집’과 구여성이라는 부정적 기표가 사용된 양상을 분석하였다. 그를 통해 1920년대 후반부터 1930년대 초반에 걸쳐 여성 담론이 폭발하면서 긍정적인 것뿐 아니라 부정적인 여성 기표도 함께 증가한 배경에는 젠더관계의 재편이 있었음을 확인하였다. 가장 중요한 변화는 여성들이 공적 영역에등장했을 뿐 아니라 남성의 지배로부터도 해방되어 대등한 사람으로서 관계 맺기를 주장했다는 점이다. 지식인 남성들은 여성들도 민족 또는 계급해방운동에동참하기를 기대하면서 신여성의 등장을 환영했지만, 다른 한편으로는 사적 관계에서 자신이 이러한 새로운 여성들과 어떻게 관계를 맺어야 할 것인가 하는문제에 봉착했다. 이때 식민지 조선의 남성 대부분이 새로운 이상적 가정을 뒷받침할 수 있는 경제력이 없었다는 사실이 논의를 극단적으로 몰고 갔다. 성적 대상으로 치부된 ‘젊은’ 여성들은 남성을 유혹해서 타락시키는 존재이면서, 동시에남성들이 소유하고자 욕망하는 대상이 되었다. 또한 ‘배운’ 여성들은 연애결혼의상대로 설정되었지만, 남편에게 순종하지 않고 가난한 살림살이를 꾸려 내지 못하는 경우에는 조선의 현실에 맞지 않게 건방지고 사치를 부린다고 비난당했다.이 과정에서 젊은 여성을 가리키던 ‘계집’은 성적 대상을 비하하는 어휘로 전환되었고, 구여성은 신여성을 남성에게 순응하는 배우자이도록 제한하려는 의도에서만 긍정적으로 묘사되었다. 1930년대 후반 ‘계집’이 유흥업 종사자뿐 아니라 남편의 소유물이라는 의미에서 아내를 가리키게 된 현상은 가정 안팎에서 모두 남녀 관계를 성적으로 인식하게 되었다는 것, 그리고 가정 내에서는 아내가 남편과대등하기를 바라던 신여성들의 기획이 실패했다는 것을 의미한다. 이상과 같이근대 이후 남성 개념보다는 여성 개념이 논쟁의 중심에 서면서 시대 변화와 함께두드러지게 변화되었다","As part of the work to analyze the concept of women in Colonial Korea, this paper investigates the usage of negative signifiers such as gyejib (bitch) and ‘old-fashioned woman’ in major magazines published during the first half of the 20th century, confirming that there was a reorganization of gender relations between the late 1920s and early 1930s. The most important change is that women not only appeared in the public sphere, but also claimed equality with men. In the public sphere, male intellectuals welcomed the emergence of this female role, seeing women as potential allies in the national or class liberation movements, but they also faced a serious challenge in deciding how to engage with these new women in their personal relationships. At the time, most of the men of colonial Korea lacked the economic power to support the new ideal family, which drove the discussion to extremes. ‘Young’ women were regarded as sexual objects and targets for men to possess, but this also created a representation of fallen women who corrupt men. In contrast, ‘learned’ women were seen in the context of a loving marriage, but were condemned as impertinent if they did not obey their husbands and as extravagant if they could not manage their household. In this period, the meaning of gyejib, which referred to a young woman, was narrowed to become an object of sexual desire, and the meaning of ‘old-fashioned woman’ had a positive connotation only when it was used to make new women accept the role of compliant spouse. During the late 1930s, gyejib came to mean a wife as a chattel possessed by her husband, demonstrating the failure of the new woman’s aspiration to be her husband’s equal. There were significant changes to the concept of women, as compared with the concept of men, reinforcing the usefulness of a ‘special’ as opposed to a ‘universal’ focus in the study of conceptual history.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Structuring of data library is made by selecting 4 types of crops in the subject area to structure the orthophotograph as the base data for crop reading in accordance with the growth period and flight height. As a result of the visual reading by using the pattern of photo imaging for each elevation, the initial crop reading following the elevation and growth period had low recognition rate, but it gets heightened as it approaches to mid to later time of growth. In addition, the case of crop cultivation area of 1,000㎡ or more and the learning effect by pattern analysis have worked as an important factor in the increase of recognition rate. The result of this study is considered to be facilitated in the agriculture and statistics fields for the growth of crop and field survey works, and there is a need to reinforce the study on pattern recognition to overcome the limitation of visual reading structuring of various libraries for enhancing the crop recognition rate.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

They have developed the idea of ‘small-Sinocentrism(小中華)’ which means that Chosun dynasty can be a country of small-Sinocentrism succeeding to Ming dynasty as long as they inherit and practice the traditions of Han Chinese(漢族) and reinforced existing Han Chinese-centered Sinocentrism for about 150 years. In this social atmosphere, Hong Dae-yong’s travelogs introduced the information about the reality of international situation related to the Han Chinese people’s point of view on international society and the advancement of Qing dynasty compared to the backwardness of Chosun.  Basically, Han Chinese people evaluated Qing dynasty, governed by Manchurian, not based on their ethnic group but on practical point of view such as political stability and people’s quality of life. They had the practical point of view about the Chinese queue(辮髮) and Manchurian costume which regarded as symbols of barbaric practice for Chosun people. And Han Chinese people presented embarrassed look with Hong Dae-yong’s speeches and behaviors based on Han Chinese-centered Sinocentrism.  Meanwhile, while he kept belittling Manchurian as a barbarian and highly appreciating Chosun as a country of small-Sinocentrism, Hong Dae-yong realized and admitted the fact that Qing was highly advanced country compared to Chosun in various ways from culture, technology, academic diversity and people’s character. Especially, Hong Dae-yong’s criticism on Chosun’s academic practices, scholars’ closed attitude focusing only on Confucianism and Chinese documents, connoted criticism on small-Sinocentrism.  Hong Dae-yong’s travelogs ended showing two contradictory point of view on Qing and Chosun society, but his records influenced the development of the idea of “the thoughts for learning Qing culture(北學)” which admitted virtues of Qing society and argued that Chosun should try to learn and introduce Qing ’s culture.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

In this paper, the very Jeong Yak-yong’s concept of ‘Sang-je’ is ruminated on. Hereupon, in this paper, firstly Jeong Yak-yong’s concept of ‘Sang-je’ that is understood by this writer is presented. Secondly, the contents and the tendencies found in precedent Tasan studies that have been dealing with the above-mentioned concept at home and abroad are outlined. Thirdly, based on above discussions, the main points of issue that have been raised in preceding Tasan studies around the above-mentioned concept and this writer’s opinions about these main points of issue are presented in turn.In conclusion, this writer’s stands about the main points of issue that have been raised in precedent Tasan studies around the above-mentioned concept are as follows. Firstly, concerning ‘the origin’ of Jeong Yak-yong’s concept of ‘Sang-je’, ① the influences of Catholicism that are represented by Cheon-ju Sil-eu(『天主實義』, Tian-zhu Shi-yi, The True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven) which had claimed to stand for the accommodationist explanations of Confucianism ⓐ served in reality as a major momentum that reconfirmed and reinforced Jeong Yak-yong’s critical mind about the then current learning and his confident belief in his early scholarship held on since 21 years old and made him capable of finding some new expressions to embody it, ⓑ above all, gave him an objective eye enable to take a survey of the whole Confucian traditions in which he himself had been included and via this provided him some insights and clues to dig out and reinterpret the Confucian traditions. ② In view of these facts, a standpoint that denies Catholic influences on Jeong Yak-yong’s concept of ‘Sang-je’ entirely, not to mention a standpoint that overemphasizes Catholic influences on that exclusively, is not to the point.Secondly, regarding ‘the meaning’ of Jeong Yak-yong’s term of ‘Jo-hwa(造化, Zao-hua, the creation and the operation of the universe)’ that was recognized as one of Sang-je’s powers, ① Jeong Yak-yong used this term in a broad sense, namely, as a term that included not only the meaning of ‘the operation of the universe’ that implied the meanings of ‘the exercise of authority over heaven, earth and all things, the control and the management over them, the growth of them’ at the same time, but also the meaning of ‘the creation of them’. ② In this context, some studies which maintained that Sang-je is ‘the ruler of the cosmos, not its creator’ or it means only ‘the Mother Nature’s principle of producing and extinguishing all things’ may have room for reconsideration.Thirdly, referring to ‘the meaning’ of Jeong Yak-yong’s term of ‘Jae-je(宰制, zai-zhi, the control and the management of the universe)’ that was also recognized as one of Sang-je’s powers, especially a question of ‘ Does Jae-je involve the meaning of revelation?’, ① Jeong Yak-yong answered this question that Sang-je reveals its own order, that is, Cheon-myeong(天命, Tian-ming, Heaven’s decree) through ‘Do-sim(道心, Dao-xin, mind of the Way)’ and ‘divination by Ju-yeok(『周易』, Zhou-yi or Yi-jing, Book of Changes)’ to human beings continually. ② In this sense, among the existing Tasan studies, some arguments that appraise and recognize Jeong Yak-yong’s Sang-je merely as ‘a moral force’, ‘a dumb existence without revelation’, ‘a deistic supervisor’ or ‘an impersonal and an abstract existence’ may be problematic.Lastly, respecting ‘the conceptual position’ of Jeong Yak-yong’s concept of ‘Sang-je’ occupying in his philosophical world view and his learning system, ① Jeong Yak-yong’s ‘Sang-je’ can be seen at least as a core and an indispensable ca...",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

A full-scale war is highly improbable, but a series of local crises highly likely. For decades, South Asia has observed a series of Pakistan's provocations against India, despite New Delhi's material superiority and independent nuclear forces. A stability-instability paradox will enable North Korea to enjoy the nuclear shield and to challenge the status-quo in the Korean Peninsula. Under the circumstances, South Korea should (1) maintain crisis stability (2) challenge North Korea with medium level of risk and (3) learn the lessons from the Cold War America and the contemporary India.",reinforcement_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

A Clustering Approach for Feature Selection in Microarray Data Classification Using Random Forest,2018,"['Classification', 'Clustering', 'Dimensional Reduction', 'Microarray', 'Random Forest']",,"Microarray data plays an essential role in diagnosing and detecting cancer. Microarray analysis allows the examination of levels of gene expression in specific cell samples, where thousands of genes can be analyzed simultaneously.

Dimensional reduction can eliminate redundancy of data; thus, features used in classification are features that only have a high correlation with their class. There are two types of dimensional reduction, namely feature selection and feature extraction. In this paper, we used k-means algorithm as the clustering approach for feature selection. The proposed approach can be used to categorize features that have the same characteristics in one cluster, so that redundancy in microarray data is removed. The result of clustering is ranked using the Relief algorithm such that the best scoring element for each cluster is obtained. All best elements of each cluster are selected and used as features in the classification process. Next, the Random Forest algorithm is used. Based on the simulation, the accuracy of the proposed approach for each dataset, namely Colon, Lung Cancer, and Prostate Tumor, achieved 85.87%, 98.9%, and 89% accuracy, respectively.

The RF model is designed with optimal parameters and descriptors through parameter effect experiment. Feature ranking is also implemented to eliminate unnecessary attributes from the dataset. Using the pre-processed data, the optimal RF model achieved a test accuracy of 86.9% for the classification problem of predicting the leak location among 40-potential leak sources in the plant.Furthermore, when analyzing prediction errors by visualizing the classification boundary of RF model, most of the prediction errors are confirmed to be misclassification of adjacent leak locations.

In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent prediction model based on the simulated annealing which is one of the well-known optimization techniques. The simulated annealing is known to have comparable optimization performance to the genetic algorithms. Nevertheless, since there has been little research on the prediction and classification of business decision-making problems using the simulated annealing, it is meaningful to confirm the usefulness of the proposed model in business analytics. In this study, we use the combined model of simulated annealing and machine learning to select the input features of the bankruptcy prediction model. Typical types of combining optimization and machine learning techniques are feature selection, feature weighting, and instance selection. This study proposes a combining model for feature selection, which has been studied the most. In order to confirm the superiority of the proposed model in this study, we apply the real-world financial data of the Korean companies and analyze the results. The results show that the predictive accuracy of the proposed model is better than that of the naïve model.

However, the newly developed devices and algorithms used in the previous studies have lacked the detection of non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep, which are known to be correlated with the development of sleep disorders, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, and neurodegeneration. We devise a novel approach to employ ensemble of deep neural network and random forest for the performance of noncontact sleep stage classification. Notably, this paper is designed based on the PSG data of sleep-disordered patients, which were received and certified by professionals at Hanyang University Hospital. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is highlighted by contrasting sleep stage classification performance with previously proposed methods and a commercialized sleep monitoring device called ResMed S+.

Hence study was conducted along the three unprotected zones of riparian forest in Dikhu river, Nagaland, north-east India in order to compared the diversity, distribution and population structure of riparian trees. In each zone 100×100 m2 plot were marked and subdivided into 20 plots of 10×10 m2. 10 plots on each side of the river were taken randomly covering 0.02 ha. Only tree with dbh ≥10 cm and dbh above 1.5 m above ground level were recorded as individual species. A total of 29 tree species belonging to 18 families were recorded from the three zones of the river. Tree species richness was highest at the middle zone (19) followed by upper (14) and lower zone (7). The most abundant species and family recorded at upper, middle and lower zones were Melia azaderach of Euphorbiaceae (380 stems ha-1), Terminalia chebula of Euphorbiaceae (432.5 stems ha-1) and Duabanga grandiflora of Lythraceae (365 stems ha-1) respectively. The ranges of diversity indices observed in the three zones were: Shannon-Wiener index (1.25-0.73), Simpson diversity index (0.42-0.93), Evenness index (0.47-0.37) and Index of co-dominance (0.75-0.94).

To improve the regeneration through seeds, various parameters such as viability of seeds, water uptake, and effect of seed mass on germination and pretreatments were performed using a completely randomized design (CRD). Tetrazolium (TZ) test was conducted using fresh, mature seeds revealed 50±2.56% mean viability. Seeds of different weight classes showed similar pattern of water uptake and the saturation level was achieved at 60hrs of soaking. Seeds belong to weight class 2.6-3.5g were germinated (12.5±1.26%) with 175±1.75 days (d) of mean time taken for germination (MTG). Germination capacity of seeds varied significantly among different populations and Varkala population gave 12.5±1.1% germination with 174.6±2.5 d MTG. Among various seed treatments, mechanical scarification was superior in germination and significant reduction in MTG (p0.05). The mechanical scarification by complete removal of seed coat resulted in 49.2±1.52% germination within a short period of time (9.52±0.89 d MTG). However, the complete removal of seed coat without damaging to embryo is a difficult task. An alternate treatment (Mechanical scarification II) by making cracks on nut faces vertically followed by soaking in distilled water for 24hrs gave 48.4±1.73% germination with significantly reduced MTG (12.14±0.56 d) over unsoaked, untreated control (6.5±1.84% germination and 197.18±1.79 d MTG; p0.05). This treatment (Mechanical scarification II) is therefore recommended for E. serratus seeds as it can adopt easily and can achieve 7 fold increases in germination over control. The recorded germination through mechanical scarification is in tune with realized viability percentage of the seeds.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

Therefore, this study proposes a target re-designation algorithm that makes decision based on hit probability which considers real-time field environment. The proposed method contains a trajectory prediction model that predicts the expected trajectory of the TBM from the current position and velocity information by using random forest and moving window. The predicted hit probability can be calculated through the trajectory prediction model and the simulator of the intercept missile, and the calculated hit probability becomes the decision criterion of the target re-designation algorithm for the missile.

Such forest disasters can occur randomly and develop rapidly, so the in-situ observations may be limited spatially and temporally. As an alternative, satellite remote sensing is an effective method for detecting forest disasters. This paper described the development of a forest disaster detection method by combining the existing spectral methods and a state-of-the-art deep learning technique. NBR(Normalized Burned Ratio), BAI(Burn Area Index), and FBI(Fire Burn Index), which are mainly used fire damage indices, were applied to seven forest fires cases together with the satellite images from Kompsat-3A, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 5. The existing spectral methods have limitation of threshold adjustment for each region and for each season. To mitigate this problem, we used the FCN(Fully Convolutional Network)-based U-Net model, which produced more effective detectability of forest fire damages. For future work, the result of spectral methods and several deep learning techniques can be compared quantitatively to prove the performance of U-Net model objectively.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

Time-series analysis on high resolution images requires to collect extensive amount of ground truth data. In this study, the potential of land coverage mapas ground truth data was tested in classifying high-resolution imagery. The study site was Wonju-si at Gangwon-do, South Korea, having a mix of urban and natural areas. KOMPSAT-3A imagery taken on March 2015 and land coverage map published in 2017 were used as source data. Two pixel-based classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were selected for the analysis. Forest only classification was compared with that of the whole study area except wetland. Confusion matrixes from the classification presented that overall accuracies for both the targets were higher in RF algorithm than in SVM. While the overall accuracy in the forest only analysis by RF algorithm was higher by 18.3% than SVM, in the case of the whole region analysis, the difference was relatively smaller by 5.5%. For the SVM algorithm, adding the Majority analysis process indicated a marginal improvement of about 1% than the normal SVM analysis. It was found that the RF algorithm was more effective to identify the broad-leaved forest within the forest, but for the other classes the SVM algorithm was more effective. As the two pixel-based classification algorithms were tested here, it is expected that future classification will improve the overall accuracy and the reliability by introducing a time-series analysis and an object-based algorithm. It is considered that this approach will contribute to improving a large-scale land planning by providing an effective land classification method on higher spatial and temporal scales.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

Financial characteristics help build prediction models that are expected to be contained in the assigning model of the bond rating agencies. However, the ranges of bond ratings in existing studies vary from 5 to 20 and the prediction models were developed with samples in which the target companies and the observation periods are different. Thus, a simple comparison of the prediction accuracies in each study cannot determine the best prediction model. In order to conduct a fair comparison, this study has collected corporate bond ratings and financial characteristics from 2013 to 2017 and applied prediction models to them. In addition, we applied the elastic-net penalty for the linear regression, the ordered logit, and the ordered probit. Our comparison shows that data-driven variable selection using the elastic-net improves prediction accuracy in each corresponding model, and that the random forest is the most appropriate model in terms of prediction accuracy, which obtains 69.6% accuracy of the exact rating prediction on average from the 5-fold cross validation.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

However, starting from 2015 the Korean film industry entered a period of low growth and experienced a negative growth after all in 2016. To overcome such difficulty, stakeholders like production company, distribution company, multiplex have attempted to maximize the market returns using strategies of predicting change of market and of responding to such market change immediately. Since a film is classified as one of experiential products, it is not easy to predict a box office record and the initial number of audiences before the film is released. And also, the number of audiences fluctuates with a variety of factors after the film is released. So, the production company and distribution company try to be guaranteed the number of screens at the opining time of a newly released by multiplex chains. However, the multiplex chains tend to open the screening schedule during only a week and then determine the number of screening of the forthcoming week based on the box office record and the evaluation of audiences. Many previous researches have conducted to deal with the prediction of box office records of films. In the early stage, the researches attempted to identify factors affecting the box office record. And nowadays, many studies have tried to apply various analytic techniques to the factors identified previously in order to improve the accuracy of prediction and to explain the effect of each factor instead of identifying new factors affecting the box office record. However, most of previous researches have limitations in that they used the total number of audiences from the opening to the end as a target variable, and this makes it difficult to predict and respond to the demand of market which changes dynamically. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to predict the weekly number of audiences of a newly released film so that the stakeholder can flexibly and elastically respond to the change of the number of audiences in the film. To that end, we considered the factors used in the previous studies affecting box office and developed new factors not used in previous studies such as the order of opening of movies, dynamics of sales. Along with the comprehensive factors, we used the machine learning method such as Random Forest, Multi Layer Perception, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bays, to predict the number of cumulative visitors from the first week after a film release to the third week. At the point of the first and the second week, we predicted the cumulative number of visitors of the forthcoming week for a released film. And at the point of the third week, we predict the total number of visitors of the film.In addition, we predicted the total number of cumulative visitors also at the point of the both first week and second week using the same factors. As a result, we found the accuracy of predicting the number of visitors at the forthcoming week was higher than that of predicting the total number of them in all of three weeks, and also the accuracy of the Random Forest was the highest among the machine learning methods we used. This study has implications in that this study 1) considered various factors comprehensively which affect the box office record and merely addressed by other previous researches such as the weekly rating of audiences after release, the weekly rank of the film after release, and the weekly sales share after release, and 2) tried to predict and respond to the demand of market which changes dynamically by suggesting models which predicts the weekly number of audiences of newly released films so that the stakeholders can flexibly and elastically respond to the change of the number of audiences in the film.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

It tries to answer the question “Who leaves comments on online news articles or shares news stories with others?” Commenting on news articles and sharing news stories influence news consumption and society at large, but it is not clear who is leaving the comments and sharing the news. This study differs from previous studies because it applies statistical learning in order to obtain the closest answer to reality, not by making assumptions but by using real data. This paper proposes an optimal model for predicting comment writers and news sharers by applying logistic regression analyses, linear/nonlinear discriminant analyses, decision tree models, random forests, and support vector machines. As a result, we could predict the commenters and the sharers with 99% and 94% accuracy, respectively, using random forests. Furthermore, it is reasonable to consider commenters and news sharers the “leaders of the online news culture” because the groups were identified to be almost identical. They were highly educated, politically liberal or moderate, and active in social activities such as signing campaigns and making donations. In addition, people with a lower amount of trust in national news media tended to write comments and share news, and the more socially influential they regard journalists as being, the more likely they are to share news stories. Finally, the leaders of the online news culture spend a significant amount of time on social networking sites and messaging services. Particularly, news commenters consume or participate in new independent media such as podcasts or YouTube videos, and news sharers actively read news from various media, including social networking sites, messaging services, and political magazines.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv
Korean Traditional Music Genre Classification Using Sample and MIDI Phrases,2018,"['Music genre classification', 'music sample analysis', 'MIDI analysis', 'Korean traditional music', 'music editor']",,"This paper proposes a MIDI- and audio-based music genre classification method for Korean traditional music. There are many traditional instruments in Korea, and most of the traditional songs played using the instruments have similar patterns and rhythms. Although music information processing such as music genre classification and audio melody extraction have been studied, most studies have focused on pop, jazz, rock, and other universal genres. There are few studies on Korean traditional music because of the lack of datasets. This paper analyzes raw audio and MIDI phrases in Korean traditional music, performed using Korean traditional musical instruments. The classified samples and MIDI, based on our classification system, will be used to construct a database or to implement our Kontakt-based instrument library. Thus, we can construct a management system for a Korean traditional music library using this classification system. Appropriate feature sets for raw audio and MIDI phrases are proposed and the classification results―based on machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, multi-layer perception, decision tree, and random forest―are outlined in this paper.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

The manual inspection of quality in a mass production system may result in low consistency and efficiency. Therefore, the quality inspection of mass-produced products involves automatic checking and classifying by the machines in many processes. Although there are many preceding studies on improving or optimizing the process using the data generated in the production process, there have been many constraints with regard to actual implementation due to the technical limitations of processing a large volume of data in real time. The recent research studies on big data have improved the data processing technology and enabled collecting, processing, and analyzing process data in real time. This paper aims to propose the process and details of applying big data for quality inspection and examine the applicability of the proposed method to the dairy industry. We review the previous studies and propose a big data analysis procedure that is applicable to the manufacturing sector. To assess the feasibility of the proposed method, we applied two methods to one of the quality inspection processes in the dairy industry: convolutional neural network and random forest. We collected, processed, and analyzed the images of caps and straws in real time, and then determined whether the products were defective or not. The result confirmed that there was a drastic increase in classification accuracy compared to the quality inspection performed in the past.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

In order to prevent this, the anti-quarantine authorities have tried various human and material endeavors, but the infectious diseases have continued to occur. Avian influenza is known to be developed in 1878 and it rose as a national issue due to its high lethality. Food and mouth disease is considered as most critical animal infectious disease internationally. In a nation where this disease has not been spread, food and mouth disease is recognized as economic disease or political disease because it restricts international trade by making it complex to import processed and non-processed live stock, and also quarantine is costly. In a society where whole nation is connected by zone of life, there is no way to prevent the spread of infectious disease fully. Hence, there is a need to be aware of occurrence of the disease and to take action before it is distributed.Epidemiological investigation on definite diagnosis target is implemented and measures are taken to prevent the spread of disease according to the investigation results, simultaneously with the confirmation of both human infectious disease and animal infectious disease. The foundation of epidemiological investigation is figuring out to where one has been, and whom he or she has met. In a data perspective, this can be defined as an action taken to predict the cause of disease outbreak, outbreak location, and future infection, by collecting and analyzing geographic data and relation data. Recently, an attempt has been made to develop a prediction model of infectious disease by using Big Data and deep learning technology, but there is no active research on model building studies and case reports. KT and the Ministry of Science and ICT have been carrying out big data projects since 2014 as part of national R &D projects to analyze and predict the route of livestock related vehicles. To prevent animal infectious diseases, the researchers first developed a prediction model based on a regression analysis using vehicle movement data. After that, more accurate prediction model was constructed using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Lasso, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. In particular, the prediction model for 2017 added the risk of diffusion to the facilities, and the performance of the model was improved by considering the hyper-parameters of the modeling in various ways. Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve show that the model constructed in 2017 is superior to the machine learning model. The difference between the2016 model and the 2017 model is that visiting information on facilities such as feed factory and slaughter house, and information on bird livestock, which was limited to chicken and duck but now expanded to goose and quail, has been used for analysis in the later model. In addition, an explanation of the results was added to help the authorities in making decisions and to establish a basis for persuading stakeholders in 2017. This study reports an animal infectious disease prevention system which is constructed on the basis of hazardous vehicle movement, farm and environment Big Data. The significance of this study is that it describes the evolution process of the prediction model using Big Data which is used in the field and the model is expected to be more complete if the form of viruses is put into consideration. This will contribute to data utilization and analysis model development in related field. In addition, we expect that the system constructed in this study will provide more preventive and effective prevention.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

For the sake of improving the prediction performance more reliably, the proposed EPNN model is based on various types of activation functions like hyperbolic tangent, linear, and Gaussian functions, all of which are embedded in hidden nodes to improve its performance. In order to verify the validity of the proposed EPNN model, a number of HRV metrics were calculated from 20 valid and qualified participants whose emotions were induced by using money game. To add more rigor to the experiment, the participants’ valence and arousal were checked and used as output node of the EPNN.

In particular, we present global maps at 500 m resolution of specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content per dry mass, and leaf nitrogen/phosphorus ratio. The processing chain exploits machine learning techniques along with optical remote sensing data (MODIS/Landsat) and climate data for gap filling and up-scaling of in-situ measured leaf traits. The chain first uses random forests regression with surrogates to fill gaps in the database (> 45<I>%</I> of missing entries) and maximizes the global representativeness of the trait dataset. Plant species are then aggregated to Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Next, the spatial abundance of PFTs at MODIS resolution (500 m) is calculated using Landsat data (30 m). Based on these PFT abundances, representative trait values are calculated for MODIS pixels with nearby trait data. Finally, different regression algorithms are applied to globally predict trait estimates from these MODIS pixels using remote sensing and climate data. The methods were compared in terms of precision, robustness and efficiency. The best model (random forests regression) shows good precision (normalized RMSE≤ 20<I>%</I>) and goodness of fit (averaged Pearson's correlation R = 0.78) in any considered trait. Along with the estimated global maps of leaf traits, we provide associated uncertainty estimates derived from the regression models. The process chain is modular, and can easily accommodate new traits, data streams (traits databases and remote sensing data), and methods. The machine learning techniques applied allow attribution of information gain to data input and thus provide the opportunity to understand trait-environment relationships at the plant and ecosystem scales. The new data products – the gap-filled trait matrix, a global map of PFT abundance per MODIS gridcells and the high-resolution global leaf trait maps – are complementary to existing large-scale observations of the land surface and we therefore anticipate substantial contributions to advances in quantifying, understanding and prediction of the Earth system.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Presented a modular process chain for plant trait mapping including local effects </LI> <LI>  High-resolution global maps of leaf traits by fusing measured trait data, LANDSAT and MODIS </LI> <LI>  Scope for testing and parameterizing trait-enabled Earth System models </LI> <LI>  Implications for land management and Earth system science applications </LI> </UL> </P>",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

Our strategy is to detect text regions which we define as part of text lines containing a whole character or transitions between two adjacent characters. We observe that, if we scale text regions to a small and fixed size, their image gradients exhibit certain patterns irrespective of text shapes and language types. Based on this observation, we propose simple features which consist of means and standard deviations of image gradients to train a Random Forest so as to detect text regions over multiple image scales and color channels. Text regions are then merged into text line candidates which are ranked based on the Random Forest responses combined with the shapes of the candidates, e.g., horizontally elongated candidates are given higher scores, because they are more likely to contain texts. Even though our method is trained on English, our experiments demonstrate that it achieves high recall with a few thousand good quality proposals on four standard benchmarks, including multi-language datasets. Following the One-to-One and Many-to-One detection criteria, our method achieves 91.6%, 87.4%, 92.1% and 97.9% recall on the ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Dataset, Street View Text Dataset, Pan’s multilingual Dataset and Sampled KAIST Scene Text Dataset respectively, with an average of less than 1250 proposals.</P>",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

Thus it is difficult to know how much they are exposed to crime. If the police can predict the crime risky area, it will be possible to cope with the crime efficiently even though insufficient police and enforcement resources. However, there is no prediction system in Korea and the related researches are very much poor. From these backgrounds, the final goal of this study is to develop an automated crime prediction system. However, for the first step, we build a big data set which consists of local real crime information and urban physicalor non-physical data. Then, we developed a crime prediction model through machine learning method. Finally, we assumed several possible scenarios and calculated the probability of crime and visualized the results in a map so as to increase the people's understanding. Among the factors affecting the crime occurrence revealed in previous and case studies, data was processed in the form of a big data for machine learning: real crime information, weather information (temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, sunshine, insolation, snowfall, cloud cover) and local information (average building coverage, average floor area ratio, average building height, number of buildings, average appraised land value, average area of residential building, average number of ground floor). Among the supervised machine learning algorithms, the decision tree model, the random forest model, and the SVM model, which are known to be powerful and accurate in various fields were utilized to construct crime prevention model. As a result, decision tree model with the lowest RMSE was selected as an optimal prediction model. Based on this model, several scenarios were set for theft and violence cases which are the most frequent in the case city J, and the probability of crime was estimated by 250x250m grid. As a result, we could find that the high crime risky area is occurring in three patterns in case city J. The probability of crime was divided into three classes and visualized in map by 250 x 250m grid. Finally, we could develop a crime prediction model using machine learning algorithm and visualized the crime risky areas in a map which can recalculate the model and visualize the result simultaneously as time and urban conditions change.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

For accurate deformation and defect inspection, the proposed system compares a pair of two high-resolution images acquired by a laser scan camera equipped on a railway vehicle. The proposed system consists of three parts: i) object detection using classifiers learned by random forest, ii) facility position alignment using phase correlation matching, and iii) deformation and defect detection using image registration and subtraction. The proposed inspection system performs automatic inspections by detecting facilities and any deformed regions.

In this paper, empirical analysis based on data is performed referring to previous studies. Focusing on the policy interest rate among the factors affecting the housing price, the non-linear impulse responses of other variables to the interest rate shock are analyzed. Using the random forest algorithm, the variable importance scores of the macroeconomic variables presented in the previous studies are calculated. After selecting the variables through this process, the impulse responses are calculated using a model that can capture non-linearity. According to the model, the responses of housing prices to the policy rate is only significant when the rate is raised. Especially, the impulse response is amplified when the shock increases due to the non-linear characteristics that can not be captured by the traditional VAR methodology. The analysis results suggest that the interest rate as a policy instrument should be approached from a more cautious perspective.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

In this paper, we propose a method to detect the presence-or-not of meteorological phenomena by applying machine learning to the back-scattered data collected from the ceilometer. First, to eliminate the noise in the observation data, linear interpolation and denoising autoencoder is used to perform noise elimination on the back-scattered data.

This is a subjective feeling that depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. With the advent of robotic surgery, there is an urgent need for the creation of a patient-specific surgical planning system.A learning-based predictive model is needed to understand the sensitivity of pedicle-screw holding power to various factors.Methods: Pullout studies were carried out on rigid polyurethane foam, representing extremely osteoporotic to normal bone for different insertion depths and angles of a pedicle screw. The results of these experimental studies were used to build a pullout-strength predictor and a decision tree using a machine-learning approach.Results: Based on analysis of variance, it was found that all the factors under study had a significant effect (p <0.05) on the holding power of a pedicle screw. Of the various machine-learning techniques, the random forest regression model performed well in predicting the pullout strength and in creating a decision tree. Performance was evaluated, and a correlation coefficient of 0.99 was obtained between the observed and predicted values. The mean and standard deviation of the normalized predicted pullout strength for the confirmation experiment using the current model was 1.01±0.04.Conclusions: The random forest regression model was used to build a pullout-strength predictor and decision tree. The model was able to predict the holding power of a pedicle screw for any combination of density, insertion depth, and insertion angle for the chosen range. The decision-tree model can be applied in patient-specific surgical planning and a decision-support system for spine-fusion surgery.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

This paper presents the automated process for the selection of training areas which are essential to conducting supervised image classification. The training areas were selected based on the prior and cover information. After the selection, the training data were used to classify land cover in an urban area with the latest image and the classification accuracy was valuated. The automatic selection of training area was processed with following steps, 1) to redraw inner areas of prior land cover polygon with negative buffer (-15m) 2) to select the polygons with proper size of area (2,000 ~200,000㎡) 3) to calculate the mean and standard deviation of reflectance and NDVI of the polygons 4) to select the polygons having characteristic mean value of each land cover type with minimum standard deviation. The supervised image classification was conducted using the automatically selected training data with Sentinel-2 images in 2017. The accuracy of land cover classification was 86.9% ( = 0.81). The result shows that the process of automatic selection is effective in image processing and able to contribute to solving the bottleneck in the application of imagery.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv
Multiple imputation for competing risks survival data via pseudo-observations,2018,"['competing risks', 'missing data', 'multiple imputation', 'pseudo-observations', 'random forest']",,"Competing risks are commonly encountered in biomedical research. Regression models for competing risks data can be developed based on data routinely collected in hospitals or general practices. However, these data sets usually contain the covariate missing values. To overcome this problem, multiple imputation is often used to fit regression models under a MAR assumption. Here, we introduce a multivariate imputation in a chained equations algorithm to deal with competing risks survival data. Using pseudo-observations, we make use of the available outcome information by accommodating the competing risk structure. Lastly, we illustrate the practical advantages of our approach using simulations and two data examples from a coronary artery disease data and hepatocellular carcinoma data.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

Following training, these models were compared to the predictive capability of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification.Results: A total of 20,879 patients were identified as having undergone ACDF. Following exclusion criteria, patients were divided into 14,615 patients for training and 6,264 for testing data sets.

Public concern regarding red imported fire ants has been increasing, as they have been found seven times in South Korea. Even if red imported fire ants are not yet colonized in South Korea, a proper quarantine plan is necessary to prevent their widespread distribution. As a basis for quarantine planning, we modeled the potential distribution of the red imported fire ant under current climate conditions using six different species distribution models (SDMs) and then selected the random forest (RF) model for modeling the potential distribution under climate change. We acquired occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and bioclimatic data from WorldClim. We modeled at the global scale to project the potential distribution under the current climate and then applied models at the local scale to project the potential distribution of the red imported fire ant under climate change. Modeled results successfully represent the current distribution of red imported fire ants. The potential distribution area for red imported fire ants increased to include major harbors and airports in South Korea under the climate change scenario (RCP 8.5).

To identify molecular signatures for lymphatic invasion, we found differentially expressed genes. The performance of classifier was validated by receiver operating characteristics analysis, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machine (SVM). We assessed prognostic role of classifier using random survival forest (RSF) model and pathway deregulation score (PDS). For external validation, we analyzed microarray data from 26 EOC samples of Samsung Medical Center and curatedOvarianData database.Results We identified 21 mRNAs, and seven methylated DNAs from primary EOC tissues that predicted lymphatic invasion and created prognostic models. The classifier predicted lymphatic invasion well, which was validated by logistic regression, LDA, and SVM algorithm (C-index of 0.90, 0.71, and 0.74 for mRNA and C-index of 0.64, 0.68, and 0.69 for DNA methylation).Using RSF model, incorporating molecular data with clinical variables improved prediction of progression-free survival compared with using only clinical variables (p < 0.001 and p=0.008). Similarly, PDS enabled us to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk group, which resulted in survival difference in mRNA profiles (log-rank p-value=0.011).

The proposed approach automatically generates high-dimensional feature vectors in up to 75 dimensions, which are then fed into an intelligent system built on a random forest classifier for accurately classifying voxels from only a handful of selection scribbles made directly on the input data by the user. We apply the probabilistic transfer function to further customize and refine the rendered result.

REAL TIME DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF ARROW MARKINGS IN URBAN STREETS,2018,"['Arrow markings classification', 'Urban localization']",,"For highly automated driving in urban regions it is essential to know the precise position of the car.Furthermore it is important to understand the surrounding context in complex situations, e.g. multilane crossings and turn lanes. To understand those situations there is not only the task to detect the lane border, but to detect the painted information inside the lane. The paper is facing and evaluating two methods to classify this additional lane information. Therefore the images from five cameras mounted around the car are used. Four of them with fisheye lenses. The methods have in common, that the input images are transformed into a bird view projection. First introduced method is to extract contours from the transformed images and collect geometrical features and Fourier coefficients. The second introduced way, is to calculate histograms of oriented gradients and use it as input for the classification step. Both classification approaches are implemented and evaluated as multiclass and single class detectors for each arrow type. Furthermore, the classification results from a support vector machine and random forest were faced for this classification problem. The results from the multiclass detectors are evaluated and presented in form of confusion matrices. With the introduced approaches a high detection confidence could be achieved, proofed with validation datasets and in practical use.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

Resource Prediction for Big Data Processing in a Cloud Data Center,2018,"['Machine learning techniques', 'Data centers', 'Workload forecasting', 'Energy-aware systems', 'Time series data']",,"The high demand for big data applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, business, and academia, as well as government, fosters the creation of large-scale cloud data centers. Cloud data centers contain thousands of physical machines (PMs), so resource management is necessary for allocating the tremendous amount of data to them. Knowing the workload demand in advance enables control of those resources, saving energy, reducing CPU and memory usage, and improving service. Workload prediction can be used to determine how many resources need to be allocated in the future. In this paper, we propose machine learning–based techniques to predict the daily operational workload.

Evaluation of summer passive microwave sea ice concentrations in the Chukchi Sea based on KOMPSAT-5 SAR and numerical weather prediction data,2018,"['Sea ice concentration', 'Sea ice algorithm', 'Passive microwave sensor', 'KOMPSAT-5', 'Synthetic aperture radar', 'Numerical weather prediction', 'Chukchi Sea']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Satellite passive microwave (PM) sensors have observed sea ice in Polar Regions and provided sea ice concentration (SIC) data since the 1970s. SIC has been used as a primary data source for climate change prediction and ship navigation. However, the accuracy of PM SIC is typically low and biased in summer. To provide more accurate information for climatic research and ship navigation, it is necessary to evaluate quantitatively the accuracy of PM SIC and to account for its errors. In this research, we evaluated the SIC data derived from PM measurements using four representative sea ice algorithms: NASA Team (NT), Bootstrap (BT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) hybrid, and Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction STudy (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI). Analyses were performed for the Chukchi Sea in summer using KOrean Multi-Purpose SATellite-5 (KOMPSAT-5) Enhanced Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Ice/water maps were generated by binary classification of texture features in the SAR images based on Random Forest, a rule-based machine learning approach. SIC values estimated from the sea ice algorithms showed good correlation with those calculated from the KOMPSAT-5 ice/water maps, but the root mean square error was larger than 10%. SIC values estimated from the algorithms showed different error trends according to the KOMPSAT-5 SIC range. All algorithms overestimated SIC values in open drift ice zones (KOMPSAT-5 SICs ranged from 0% to 15%). In marginal ice zones (SICs ranged from 15% to 80%), the OSISAF SIC values were the least biased compared to those from KOMPSAT-5. The NT algorithm largely underestimated SIC values in marginal ice zones, while the BT and ASI algorithms overestimated them considerably. All algorithms, except for BT, underestimated SIC in consolidated pack ice zones (SICs ranged from 80% to 100%). By analyzing the correlations of biases of SIC from the algorithms with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the European Reanalysis Agency Interim reanalysis, it was found that the overestimation of NT and ASI SICs was largely influenced by atmospheric water vapor content, while the underestimation of NT and OSISAF SICs was owing to ice surface melting. The overestimation of BT SICs was not significantly correlated with the NWP data. The underestimated SIC from the BT and ASI algorithms for high SIC regions might be compensated by the atmospheric water vapor content. The differences in SIC values estimated from each algorithm were due to different sensitivities to atmospheric water vapor content in the regions with KOMPSAT-5 SIC lower than 40% and to ice surface melting in the regions with higher KOMPSAT-5 SIC.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Summer sea ice concentration (SIC) was derived from KOMPSAT-5 SAR ice/water maps. </LI> <LI>  SICs from four sea ice algorithms for passive microwave measurements were evaluated. </LI> <LI>  SICs from the algorithms show different error trends by the KOMPSAT-5 SIC ranges. </LI> <LI>  Bias from algorithms' SICs was analyzed by using numerical weather prediction data. </LI> <LI>  SIC products by the algorithms are highly inaccurate for the Chukchi Sea in summer. </LI> </UL> </P>",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

A software classification scheme using binary-level characteristics for efficient software filtering,2018,,,"<P>Software filtering systems can be employed to detect and filter out pirated or counterfeit software on the Web sites and peer-to-peer networks. They determine whether a suspicious program is legal or not by comparing it with original programs in a database or in the market. To identify pirated or counterfeit software, software filtering systems need to measure software similarity when comparing a suspicious program with original ones. In this case, the comparison overhead might be very high because the suspicious program is compared with all programs in the database or market in the worst case. This paper proposes a software classification scheme for efficient software filtering systems. The scheme focuses specifically on the Windows portable executable files which have been prime targets for software pirates. The scheme extracts software characteristics from a suspicious program and classifies it into one of pre-defined categories quickly based on the characteristics. The suspicious program is compared only with the programs in the one of pre-defined categories in most cases; thus, the comparison overhead is reduced. We propose two classification methods. The first one extracts strings from GUI-related resources of a program and computes the relevance of the program to each category based on the pre-computed score of the strings. The second one extracts API call frequency from a program's execution codes and uses Random Forest technique to classify the program. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can classify programs effectively and can reduce the comparison overhead significantly.</P>",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

In applying SATCASTv2 over Iran, it was necessary to make some modifications to the algorithm, such as removing case specific thresholds of satellite predictors and rearranging COIN predictors. Then, SATCASTv2 was tested and evaluated with both the full and reduced set of predictors. The results suggested that using fixed thresholds for temporal difference predictors could miss COIN in some cases.

However, the relationship between these factors and flood damages is yet to be investigated due to the lack of systematic post-disaster surveys. Therefore, we conducted a field survey focused on damaged single family houses and collected data about the factors influencing flood damages. The data was analyzed to evaluate the relationship between various influencing factors and flood damage by using correlation analysis, decision tree model, and random forest method. Through the analyses, the major factors influencing building structure damages were found to be the inundation depth and height of the entrance. Moreover, the inundation depth, debris, and flow velocity were identified as the major factors influencing the building content damages. In the future, it is necessary to explore ways to enhance the resilience of buildings and reduce the influence of major factors by establishing local flood mitigation measures.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv
Rural Systems Visioneering: Paradigm Shift from Flux Measurement to Sustainability Science,2018,"['Sustainability science', 'Ecological-societal systems', 'Self-organization', 'Rural systems visioneering', 'Sustainable Development Goals Lab']",,"Sustainability science is an emerging transdisciplinary research which necessitates not only the communication and collaboration of scientists, practitioners and stakeholders from different disciplines and interests, but also the paradigm shift from deterministic and reductionist approaches to the old basic. Ecological-societal systems (ESS) are co-evolving complex systems having many interacting parts (or agents) whose random interactions at local scale give rise to spontaneous emerging order at global scale (i.e., self-organization). Here, the flows of energy, matter and information between the systems and their surroundings play a key role. We introduce a conceptual framework for such continually morphing dynamical systems, i.e. self-organizing hierarchical open systems (SOHOs). To understand the structure and functionality of SOHOs, we revisit the two fundamental laws of physics. Re-interpretation of these principles helps understand the destiny and better path toward sustainability, and how to reconcile ecosystem integrity with societal vision and value. We then integrate the so-called visioneering (V) framework with that of SOHOs as feedback/feedforward loops so that 'a nudged self-organization' may guide systems' agents to work together toward sustainable ESS. Finally, example is given with newly endorsed Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Lab (i.e., 'Rural systems visioneering') by Future Earth, which is now underway in rural villages in Tanzania.",random_forest_2018_academic_riss.csv

In this study, a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) was employed to predict slope stability for a slope subjected to circular failures, based on six input factors: slope height (H), slope angle (α), cohesion (c), friction angle (φ), unit weight (γ), and pore pressure ratio (ru). An expectation maximization algorithm was used to perform parameter learning for the NBC with an incomplete data set of 69 slope cases. The model validation with 13 new cases shows that, when compared to the existing empirical approach, the proposed NBC model yields better performance in terms of both accuracy and applicability (i.e., the NBC allows us to determine the probability of slope stability based on any subset of the six input factors).",naive_bayes_2018_academic_riss.csv

And, detection results from both McMaster algorithm, a well known incident detection algorithm, and the Naive Bayes algorithm, developed in this study, were compared. As a result of comparison, Naive Bayes algorithm showed less negative effect and better detect rate (DR) than the McMaster algorithm. However, as DR increases, so did false alarm rate (FAR). Also, while McMaster algorithm detected in four cycles, Naive Bayes algorithm determine the situation with just one cycle, which increases DR but also seems to have increased FAR.

However, starting from 2015 the Korean film industry entered a period of low growth and experienced a negative growth after all in 2016. To overcome such difficulty, stakeholders like production company, distribution company, multiplex have attempted to maximize the market returns using strategies of predicting change of market and of responding to such market change immediately. Since a film is classified as one of experiential products, it is not easy to predict a box office record and the initial number of audiences before the film is released. And also, the number of audiences fluctuates with a variety of factors after the film is released. So, the production company and distribution company try to be guaranteed the number of screens at the opining time of a newly released by multiplex chains. However, the multiplex chains tend to open the screening schedule during only a week and then determine the number of screening of the forthcoming week based on the box office record and the evaluation of audiences. Many previous researches have conducted to deal with the prediction of box office records of films. In the early stage, the researches attempted to identify factors affecting the box office record. And nowadays, many studies have tried to apply various analytic techniques to the factors identified previously in order to improve the accuracy of prediction and to explain the effect of each factor instead of identifying new factors affecting the box office record. However, most of previous researches have limitations in that they used the total number of audiences from the opening to the end as a target variable, and this makes it difficult to predict and respond to the demand of market which changes dynamically. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to predict the weekly number of audiences of a newly released film so that the stakeholder can flexibly and elastically respond to the change of the number of audiences in the film. To that end, we considered the factors used in the previous studies affecting box office and developed new factors not used in previous studies such as the order of opening of movies, dynamics of sales. Along with the comprehensive factors, we used the machine learning method such as Random Forest, Multi Layer Perception, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bays, to predict the number of cumulative visitors from the first week after a film release to the third week. At the point of the first and the second week, we predicted the cumulative number of visitors of the forthcoming week for a released film. And at the point of the third week, we predict the total number of visitors of the film.In addition, we predicted the total number of cumulative visitors also at the point of the both first week and second week using the same factors. As a result, we found the accuracy of predicting the number of visitors at the forthcoming week was higher than that of predicting the total number of them in all of three weeks, and also the accuracy of the Random Forest was the highest among the machine learning methods we used. This study has implications in that this study 1) considered various factors comprehensively which affect the box office record and merely addressed by other previous researches such as the weekly rating of audiences after release, the weekly rank of the film after release, and the weekly sales share after release, and 2) tried to predict and respond to the demand of market which changes dynamically by suggesting models which predicts the weekly number of audiences of newly released films so that the stakeholders can flexibly and elastically respond to the change of the number of audiences in the film.",naive_bayes_2018_academic_riss.csv

To address this challenging problem, we propose to adopt multiple kernel learning (MKL) to design a multi-hidden-layer-kernel ELM (MHLK-ELM). Specifically, we first integrate kernel functions with random feature mapping of ELM to design a hidden-layer-kernel ELM (HLK-ELM), which serves as the base of MHLK-ELM. Then, we utilize the MKL method to propose two versions of MHLK-ELMs, called sparse and non-sparse MHLK-ELMs. Both two types of MHLK-ELMs can effectively find out the optimal linear combination of multiple HLK-ELMs for different classification and regression problems.

The traditional method to detect estrus of cows is visual observation, whose success rate largely depends on the observers' experience and the frequency of observation. The integration of IoT and machine learning enables livestock diseases and estrus to be predicted. Livestock activity was measured by acceleration sensors attached to animals. Then, a system was created that can identify atypical symptoms such as those of disease and estrus.

Using OCLR, we were able to identify previously undiscovered biological mechanisms associated with the dedifferentiated oncogenic state. Analyses of the tumor microenvironment revealed unanticipated correlation of cancer stemness with immune checkpoint expression and infiltrating immune cells. We found that the dedifferentiated oncogenic phenotype was generally most prominent in metastatic tumors.

Machine-learning-based automatic identification of fetal abdominal circumference from ultrasound images,2018,,,"<P> <I>Objective</I>: Obstetricians mainly use ultrasound imaging for fetal biometric measurements. However, such measurements are cumbersome. Hence, there is urgent need for automatic biometric estimation. Automated analysis of ultrasound images is complicated owing to the patient-specific, operator-dependent, and machine-specific characteristics of such images. <I>Approach</I>: This paper proposes a method for the automatic fetal biometry estimation from 2D ultrasound data through several processes consisting of a specially designed convolutional neural network (CNN) and U-Net for each process. These machine learning techniques take clinicians’ decisions, anatomical structures, and the characteristics of ultrasound images into account. The proposed method is divided into three steps: initial abdominal circumference (AC) estimation, AC measurement, and plane acceptance checking. <I>Main results</I>: A CNN is used to classify ultrasound images (stomach bubble, amniotic fluid, and umbilical vein), and a Hough transform is used to obtain an initial estimate of the AC. These data are applied to other CNNs to estimate the spine position and bone regions. Then, the obtained information is used to determine the final AC. After determining the AC, a U-Net and a classification CNN are used to check whether the image is suitable for AC measurement. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is validated by clinical data. <I>Significance</I>: Our method achieved a Dice similarity metric of <img ALIGN='MIDDLE' ALT='' SRC='http://ej.iop.org/images/0967-3334/39/10/105007/pmeaaae255ieqn001.gif'/> for AC measurement and an accuracy of 87.10% for our acceptance check of the fetal abdominal standard plane.</P>",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

However, imputation methods for spatio-temporal data considering the inherent nature of spatio-temporal dependence have been neglected. We suggest an imputation algorithm based on ensemble spatio-temporal kriging for particulate matter measurement data for the period 2010-2014 at 54 monitoring stations near the metropolitan city of Seoul, Korea. We review previous studies on imputation methods for spatio-temporal data, then shed light on the necessity of our approach. Our approach implements resampling techniques on limited spatio-temporal data for a short-term period, then aims to enhance the imputation accuracy by taking the ensemble of the imputation results of resampled sub datasets. To examine such enhancement, we apply different conditions in experiments, including the number of resampling, neighborhood ratios, and ratios of artificially generated missing values. Results show that our approach outperforms both spatio-temporal kriging with the whole dataset (1.32~11.36%) and the linear regression-based imputation algorithm (52% in average). Our results show that the learning approach by resampling is still effective in spatiotemporal kriging in a limited environment as well as the spatio-temporal algorithm considering the inherent dependence among the data. But the considerable underperformance compared to the accuracy of the machine learning-based algorithm indicates the necessity of further examination of the effect of spatio-temporal dependence in such an algorithm.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

This study tried to find the most significant factors predicting implant prognosis using machine learning methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The data used in this study was based on a systematic search of chart files at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for one year. In this period, oral and maxillofacial surgeons inserted 667 implants in 198 patients after consultation with a prosthodontist. The traditional statistical methods were inappropriate in this study, which analyzed the data of a small sample size to find a factor affecting the prognosis. The machine learning methods were used in this study, since these methods have analyzing power for a small sample size and are able to find a new factor that has been unknown to have an effect on the result. A decision tree model and a support vector machine were used for the analysis. RESULTS.

The objective of this study is to demonstrate the performance of machine learning models in predicting postoperative complications following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).Methods: Artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest decision tree (RF) models were trained on a multicenter data set of patients undergoing ACDF to predict surgical complications based on readily available patient data. Following training, these models were compared to the predictive capability of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification.Results: A total of 20,879 patients were identified as having undergone ACDF. Following exclusion criteria, patients were divided into 14,615 patients for training and 6,264 for testing data sets. ANN and LR consistently outperformed ASA physical status classification in predicting every complication (p<0.05). The ANN outperformed LR in predicting venous thromboembolism, wound complication, and mortality (p<0.05). The SVM and RF models were no better than random chance at predicting any of the postoperative complications (p<0.05).Conclusion: ANN and LR algorithms outperform ASA physical status classification for predicting individual postoperative complications. Additionally, neural networks have greater sensitivity than LR when predicting mortality and wound complications. With the growing size of medical data, the training of machine learning on these large datasets promises to improve risk prognostication, with the ability of continuously learning making them excellent tools in complex clinical scenarios.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
ACCELERATION OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS BY TCHEBYCHEV ITERATION TECHNIQUE,2018,,,"Recently Machine Learning algorithms are widely used to process Big Data in various applications and a lot of these applications are executed in run time. Therefore the speed of Machine Learning algorithms is a critical issue in these applications. However the most of modern iteration Machine Learning algorithms use a successive iteration technique well-known in Numerical Linear Algebra. But this technique has a very low convergence, needs a lot of iterations to get solution of considering problems and therefore a lot of time for processing even on modern multi-core computers and clusters. Tchebychev iteration technique is well-known in Numerical Linear Algebra as an attractive candidate to decrease the number of iterations in Machine Learning iteration algorithms and also to decrease the running time of these algorithms those is very important especially in run time applications.

Sparse pseudoinverse incremental extreme learning machine,2018,"['Extreme learning machine', 'Hidden neuron', 'Least squares estimation', 'Matrix decomposition', 'Sparsity']",,"<P>An extreme learning machine (ELM) is a popular analytic single hidden layer feedforward neural network because of its rapid learning capacity. However, vanilla dense ELMs are affected by the overfitting problem when the number of hidden neurons is high. Further direct consequences of the density are decreases in both the training and prediction speeds. In this study, we propose an incremental method for sparsifying the ELM using a newly devised indicator driven by the condition number in the ELM design matrix, in which we call sparse pseudoinverse incremental-ELM (SPI-ELM). SPI-ELM exhibits better generalization performance and lower run-time complexity compared with ELM. However, the sparsification process may negatively affect the learning speed of SPI-ELM; thus, we introduce an iterative matrix decomposition algorithm to address this issue. We also demonstrate that there is a useful relationship between the condition number in the ELM design matrix and the number of hidden neurons. This relationship helps to understand the random weights and nonlinear activation functions in ELMs. We evaluated the SPI-ELM method based on 20 benchmark data sets from the University of California Irvine repository and three real-world databases from the computer vision domain.

Vibration analysis is conducted to acquire the dynamic fingerprints, then the Bayesian fusion is used to integrate these features and preliminarily locate the damage. The RSNB method, which combines Rough Set theory and the Naive-Bayes classifier, is introduced as a robust classification tool for damage qualification. A continuous bridge is numerically simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

An important pathophysiological mechanism of cSVD is blood-brain barrier leakage and endothelium dysfunction which gives a clue in identification of the disease through circulating biological markers. Detection of cSVD is routinely carried out by key neuroimaging markers including white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, small subcortical infarcts, perivascular spaces, cerebral microbleeds, and brain atrophy.

Reliable Machine Learning Based Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks,2018,,,"<P>Spectrum sensing is of crucial importance in cognitive radio (CR) networks. In this paper, a reliable spectrum sensing scheme is proposed, which uses K-nearest neighbor, a machine learning algorithm. In the training phase, each CR user produces a sensing report under varying conditions and, based on a global decision, either transmits or stays silent. In the training phase the local decisions of CR users are combined through a majority voting at the fusion center and a global decision is returned to each CR user. A CR user transmits or stays silent according to the global decision and at each CR user the global decision is compared to the actual primary user activity, which is ascertained through an acknowledgment signal. In the training phase enough information about the surrounding environment, i.e., the activity of PU and the behavior of each CR to that activity, is gathered and sensing classes formed. In the classification phase, each CR user compares its current sensing report to existing sensing classes and distance vectors are calculated. Based on quantitative variables, the posterior probability of each sensing class is calculated and the sensing report is classified into either representing presence or absence of PU. The quantitative variables used for calculating the posterior probability are calculated through K-nearest neighbor algorithm. These local decisions are then combined at the fusion center using a novel decision combination scheme, which takes into account the reliability of each CR user. The CR users then transmit or stay silent according to the global decision. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms conventional spectrum sensing schemes, both in fading and in nonfading environments, where performance is evaluated using metrics such as the probability of detection, total probability of error, and the ability to exploit data transmission opportunities.</P>",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Using Statistical and Machine Learning Methods to Evaluate the Prognostic Accuracy of SIRS and qSOFA,2018,"['Sepsis', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Medical Informatics', 'Artificial Intelligence']",,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare the performance of two popularly used early sepsis diagnostic criteria, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), using statistical and machine learning approaches. Methods: This retrospective study examined patient visits in Emergency Department (ED) with sepsis related diagnosis. The outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Using odds ratio (OR) and modeling methods (decision tree [DT], multivariate logistic regression [LR], and naïve Bayes [NB]), the relationships between diagnostic criteria and mortality were examined. Results: Of 132,704 eligible patient visits, 14% died within 28 days of ED admission.The association of qSOFA ≥2 with mortality (OR = 3.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.96–3.17) greater than the association of SIRS ≥2 with mortality (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.18–1.26). The area under the ROC curve for qSOFA (AUROC = 0.70) was significantly greater than for SIRS (AUROC = 0.63). For qSOFA, the sensitivity and specificity were DT = 0.39, LR = 0.64, NB = 0.62 and DT = 0.89, LR = 0.63, NB = 0.66, respectively. For SIRS, the sensitivity and specificity were DT = 0.46, LR = 0.62, NB = 0.62 and DT = 0.70, LR = 0.59, NB = 0.58, respectively. Conclusions: The evidences suggest that qSOFA is a better diagnostic criteria than SIRS. The low sensitivity of qSOFA can be improved by carefully selecting the threshold to translate the predicted probabilities into labels. These findings can guide healthcare providers in selecting risk-stratification measures for patients presenting to an ED with sepsis.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
Automatic Malware Detection with Machine Learning Algorithms in a Smart Office Environment,2018,"['Malware classification', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Pattern recognition and classification', 'Mirai malware']",,"The threat of malware in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment is increasing due to a lack of detectors. This paper proposes a method to predict the intrusion of malware using state-of-the- art machine learning algorithms that can detect malware faster and more accurately, compared with the existing methods (that is, payload, port-based, and statistical methods). A smart office environment was implemented to capture the flow of packet datasets, where malware and normal packets were captured, and 11 features were extracted from them. Four machine learning algorithms (random forest, a support vector machine, AdaBoost, and a Gaussian mixture model-based naïve Bayes classifier) were investigated to implement the automatic malware monitoring system. Random forest and AdaBoost could separate the malware and normal flows perfectly, due to their ensemble structures, which could classify unbalanced and noisy datasets.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

The objective of this study is to provide an evaluation of the safety vest detection using color information in construction-site images. The data sets of two colors of safety vests and the background were generated and used in this study. A comparative analysis of combinations of five color spaces (RGB, nRGB, HSV, Lab, and YCbCr) and six classifiers (ANN, C4.5, KNN, LR, NB, and SVM) was conducted. The performance of each combination was assessed in terms of the precision, recall, and F-measure. Moreover, an evaluation of the effects of color space conversion and the absence of luminance components on the detection performance was conducted. The comparison results showed that C4.5 classifier combined with YCbCr and SVM classifier combined with Lab, respectively, outperformed other combinations on each data set of safety vest colors. Furthermore, RGB color space transformation into non-RGB color spaces enhanced the classification performance.

Many of them start the food business since it does not require high-techs and it is possible to start the business relatively easily compared to many others in business categories. However, the closure rate of the business is also high due to excessive competition and market saturation. Cafés and restaurants are examples of food business where the business analysis is highly important. However, for most of the people who want to start their own business, it is difficult to conduct systematic business analysis such as trade area analysis or to find information for business analysis.

In particular, passengers on cruise ships are untrained and varied, making evacuation prospects worse. In such a case, the evacuation management of the crew plays a very important role. If a rescuer enters a ship at distress and conducts rescue activities, which zones represent the most effective entry should be examined. Generally, crew and rescuers take the shortest route, but if an accident occurs along the shortest route, it is necessary to select the second-best alternative. To solve this situation, this study aims to calculate evacuation routes using Q-Learning of Reinforcement Learning, which is a machine learning technique. Reinforcement learning is one of the most important functions of artificial intelligence and is currently used in many fields.

The machine learning techniques in recent years have been gaining increasing attentions due to their merits capturing information from statistical representation of events and thus enabling making decision. In this study, the deep Bayesian Belief Network Learning (DBBN) was used to extract structural information and probabilistically determine structural conditions. Different to conventional shallow learning that highly relies on the quality of the hand-crafted features, the deep learning is an end-to-end method to encode the information and interpret vast amount of data with minimizing or no features. A case study was conducted to address the methods for structure under viabilities and uncertainties due to operation, damage and noise interferences. Numerical results revealed that the deep learning exhibits considerably enhanced accuracy for structural diagnostics, as compared to the supervised shallow learning. With predetermined training set, the DBBN could accurately determine the structural health state in terms of damage level, which could dramatically help decision making for further structural retrofit or not.

Diagnosis and prediction of periodontally compromised teeth using a deep learning-based convolutional neural network algorithm,2018,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Machine learning', 'Periodontal diseases', 'Supervised machine learning']",,"Purpose: The aim of the current study was to develop a computer-assisted detection system based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm and to evaluate the potential usefulness and accuracy of this system for the diagnosis and prediction of periodontally compromised teeth (PCT). Methods: Combining pretrained deep CNN architecture and a self-trained network, periapical radiographic images were used to determine the optimal CNN algorithm and weights. The diagnostic and predictive accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve, confusion matrix, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using our deep CNN algorithm, based on a Keras framework in Python. Results: The periapical radiographic dataset was split into training (n=1,044), validation (n=348), and test (n=348) datasets. With the deep learning algorithm, the diagnostic accuracy for PCT was 81.0% for premolars and 76.7% for molars. Using 64 premolars and 64 molars that were clinically diagnosed as severe PCT, the accuracy of predicting extraction was 82.8% (95% CI, 70.1%-91.2%) for premolars and 73.4% (95% CI, 59.9%-84.0%) for molars. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the deep CNN algorithm was useful for assessing the diagnosis and predictability of PCT.

An analysis of smartphone overuse recognition in terms of emotions using brainwaves and deep learning,2018,"['Deep belief network', 'Electroencephalography (EEG)', 'Emotion recognition', 'Smartphone overuse']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The overuse of smartphones is increasingly becoming a social problem. In this paper, we analyze smartphone overuse levels, according to emotion, by examining brainwaves and deep learning. We assessed the asymmetry power with respect to theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and total brainwave activity in 11 lobes. The deep belief network (DBN) was used as the deep learning method, along with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and a support vector machine (SVM), to determine the smartphone addiction level. The risk group (13 subjects) and non-risk group (12 subjects) watched videos portraying the following concepts: relaxed, fear, joy, and sadness. We found that the risk group was more emotionally unstable than the non-risk group. In recognizing Fear, a clear difference appeared between the risk and non-risk group. The results showed that the gamma band was the most obviously different between the risk and non-risk groups. Moreover, we demonstrated that the measurements of activity in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes were indicators of emotion recognition. Through the DBN, we confirmed that these measurements were more accurate in the non-risk group than they were in the risk group.

Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms,2018,"['Deep learning', 'Diabetes', 'Heart rate variability', 'ECG', 'CNN', 'LSTM']",,"Diabetes is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM.

However, to date, no study has investigated the presence of qualitative alterations in recognition memory processes in postpartum women that may lead to a decline in cognitive ability. To address this issue, we employed the Remember/Know procedure and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Behavioral results demonstrated that compared with the matched control (CTRL) group, the postpartum (PP) group endorsed “Remember” less and “Know” more to old items. A univariate analysis of fMRI data indicated lower neural activity of the subjective recollection network in the PP group than in the CTRL group. We also performed a large-scale functional connectivity multivariate pattern analysis (fcMVPA) using task-dependent time-series to detect differences in functional connectivity patterns and neural interactivity between the PP and CTRL groups. The fcMVPA results revealed that the PP group exhibited altered functional connectivity patterns from which machine learning algorithms could discriminate group membership with 94% accuracy. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that altered subjective recollection processes in the PP group during episodic memory decisions are associated with diminished neural activity and abnormal interactivity across the subjective recollection network.

Reliable Fault Diagnosis of Rotary Machine Bearings Using a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder-Based Deep Neural Network,2018,,,"<P>Due to enhanced safety, cost-effectiveness, and reliability requirements, fault diagnosis of bearings using vibration acceleration signals has been a key area of research over the past several decades. Many fault diagnosis algorithms have been developed that can efficiently classify faults under constant speed conditions. However, the performances of these traditional algorithms deteriorate with fluctuations of the shaft speed. In the past couple of years, deep learning algorithms have not only improved the classification performance in various disciplines (e.g., in image processing and natural language processing), but also reduced the complexity of feature extraction and selection processes. In this study, using complex envelope spectra and stacked sparse autoencoder- (SSAE-) based deep neural networks (DNNs), a fault diagnosis scheme is developed that can overcome fluctuations of the shaft speed. The complex envelope spectrum made the frequency components associated with each fault type vibrant, hence helping the autoencoders to learn the characteristic features from the given input signals more readily. Moreover, the implementation of SSAE-DNN for bearing fault diagnosis has avoided the need of handcrafted features that are used in traditional fault diagnosis schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional fault diagnosis algorithms in terms of fault classification accuracy when tested with variable shaft speed data.</P>",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Thus it is difficult to know how much they are exposed to crime. If the police can predict the crime risky area, it will be possible to cope with the crime efficiently even though insufficient police and enforcement resources. However, there is no prediction system in Korea and the related researches are very much poor. From these backgrounds, the final goal of this study is to develop an automated crime prediction system. However, for the first step, we build a big data set which consists of local real crime information and urban physicalor non-physical data. Then, we developed a crime prediction model through machine learning method. Finally, we assumed several possible scenarios and calculated the probability of crime and visualized the results in a map so as to increase the people's understanding. Among the factors affecting the crime occurrence revealed in previous and case studies, data was processed in the form of a big data for machine learning: real crime information, weather information (temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, sunshine, insolation, snowfall, cloud cover) and local information (average building coverage, average floor area ratio, average building height, number of buildings, average appraised land value, average area of residential building, average number of ground floor). Among the supervised machine learning algorithms, the decision tree model, the random forest model, and the SVM model, which are known to be powerful and accurate in various fields were utilized to construct crime prevention model. As a result, decision tree model with the lowest RMSE was selected as an optimal prediction model. Based on this model, several scenarios were set for theft and violence cases which are the most frequent in the case city J, and the probability of crime was estimated by 250x250m grid. As a result, we could find that the high crime risky area is occurring in three patterns in case city J. The probability of crime was divided into three classes and visualized in map by 250 x 250m grid. Finally, we could develop a crime prediction model using machine learning algorithm and visualized the crime risky areas in a map which can recalculate the model and visualize the result simultaneously as time and urban conditions change.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

However, starting from 2015 the Korean film industry entered a period of low growth and experienced a negative growth after all in 2016. To overcome such difficulty, stakeholders like production company, distribution company, multiplex have attempted to maximize the market returns using strategies of predicting change of market and of responding to such market change immediately. Since a film is classified as one of experiential products, it is not easy to predict a box office record and the initial number of audiences before the film is released. And also, the number of audiences fluctuates with a variety of factors after the film is released. So, the production company and distribution company try to be guaranteed the number of screens at the opining time of a newly released by multiplex chains. However, the multiplex chains tend to open the screening schedule during only a week and then determine the number of screening of the forthcoming week based on the box office record and the evaluation of audiences. Many previous researches have conducted to deal with the prediction of box office records of films. In the early stage, the researches attempted to identify factors affecting the box office record. And nowadays, many studies have tried to apply various analytic techniques to the factors identified previously in order to improve the accuracy of prediction and to explain the effect of each factor instead of identifying new factors affecting the box office record. However, most of previous researches have limitations in that they used the total number of audiences from the opening to the end as a target variable, and this makes it difficult to predict and respond to the demand of market which changes dynamically. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to predict the weekly number of audiences of a newly released film so that the stakeholder can flexibly and elastically respond to the change of the number of audiences in the film. To that end, we considered the factors used in the previous studies affecting box office and developed new factors not used in previous studies such as the order of opening of movies, dynamics of sales. Along with the comprehensive factors, we used the machine learning method such as Random Forest, Multi Layer Perception, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bays, to predict the number of cumulative visitors from the first week after a film release to the third week. At the point of the first and the second week, we predicted the cumulative number of visitors of the forthcoming week for a released film. And at the point of the third week, we predict the total number of visitors of the film.In addition, we predicted the total number of cumulative visitors also at the point of the both first week and second week using the same factors. As a result, we found the accuracy of predicting the number of visitors at the forthcoming week was higher than that of predicting the total number of them in all of three weeks, and also the accuracy of the Random Forest was the highest among the machine learning methods we used. This study has implications in that this study 1) considered various factors comprehensively which affect the box office record and merely addressed by other previous researches such as the weekly rating of audiences after release, the weekly rank of the film after release, and the weekly sales share after release, and 2) tried to predict and respond to the demand of market which changes dynamically by suggesting models which predicts the weekly number of audiences of newly released films so that the stakeholders can flexibly and elastically respond to the change of the number of audiences in the film.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

To this end, we develop a Bayesian machine learning algorithm based on conditional Bayesian model averaging. In this approach, the uncertainties of the parameters, models, and prediction variables are incorporated in the predictive density simulation. The first learning stage is the variable selection. Among a number of potential prediction variables we choose the prediction variables which improve the one-month-ahead predictive density accuracy compared to an uni-variate model. The second learning stage is the model choice. We evaluate both direct and indirect prediction models using the selected prediction variables. The model weights are obtained by the relative out-of-sample density prediction performance, In the last stage, the predictive density forecasts are constructed using the model-specific density forecasts and model weights. According to our empirical results based on the monthly data ranging from December 2007 to October 2016, the variable and model uncertainties are substantial, and the relative importance of the variables and models are dramatically time-varying.

Using the Korean National Hospital Discharge In-depth Injury Survey from 2006 to 2015, the study population with disease code I60-I63 (KCD 7) were extracted for further analysis. Three tools were used for the severity-adjustment of comorbidity: the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), the Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI), and the Clinical Classification Software (CCS). The severity-adjustment models for mortality prediction in patients with acute stroke were developed using logistic regression, decision tree, neural network, and support vector machine methods. The most common comorbid disease in stroke patients were hypertension, uncomplicated (43.8%) in the ECI, and essential hypertension (43.9%) in the CCS. Among the CCI, ECI, and CCS, CCS had the highest AUC value. CCS was confirmed as the best severity correction tool. In addition, the AUC values for variables of CCS including main diagnosis, gender, age, hospitalization route, and existence of surgery were 0.808 for the logistic regression analysis, 0.785 for the decision tree, 0.809 for the neural network and 0.830 for the support vector machine.

However, lead-acid batteries have a serious problem in that deterioration of a battery makes progress quickly in the presence of that degradation of only one cell among several cells which is packed in a battery begins. To overcome this problem, previous researches have attempted to identify the mechanism of deterioration of a battery in many ways. However, most of previous researches have used data obtained in a laboratory to analyze the mechanism of deterioration of a battery but not used data obtained in a real world. The usage of real data can increase the feasibility and the applicability of the findings of a research. Therefore, this study aims to develop a model which predicts the battery deterioration using data obtained in real world. To this end, we collected data which presents change of battery state by attaching sensors enabling to monitor the battery condition in real time to dozens of golf carts operated in the real golf field. As a result, total 16,883 samples were obtained. And then, we developed a model which predicts a precursor phenomenon representing deterioration of a battery by analyzing the data collected from the sensors using machine learning techniques. As initial independent variables, we used 1) inbound time of a cart, 2) outbound time of a cart, 3) duration(from outbound time to charge time), 4) charge amount, 5) used amount, 6) charge efficiency, 7) lowest temperature of battery cell 1 to 6, 8) lowest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, 9) highest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, 10) voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the beginning of operation, 11) voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the end of charge, 12) used amount of battery cell 1 to 6 during operation, 13) used amount of battery during operation(Max-Min), 14) duration of battery use, and 15) highest current during operation. Since the values of the independent variables, lowest temperature of battery cell 1 to 6, lowest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, highest voltage of battery cell 1 to 6, voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the beginning of operation, voltage of battery cell 1 to 6 at the end of charge, and used amount of battery cell 1 to 6 during operation are similar to that of each battery cell, we conducted principal component analysis using verimax orthogonal rotation in order to mitigate the multiple collinearity problem. According to the results, we made new variables by averaging the values of independent variables clustered together, and used them as final independent variables instead of origin variables, thereby reducing the dimension. We used decision tree, logistic regression, Bayesian network as algorithms for building prediction models. And also, we built prediction models using the bagging of each of them, the boosting of each of them, and RandomForest. Experimental results show that the prediction model using the bagging of decision tree yields the best accuracy of 89.3923%. This study has some limitations in that the additional variables which affect the deterioration of battery such as weather (temperature, humidity) and driving habits, did not considered, therefore, we would like to consider the them in the future research.

Those approaches have a limitation that they are based on empirical knowledge rather than data-driven knowledge. This study suggests an advanced hedonic price model using one of the machine learning methods, named MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline), which can capture the inflection points where the explanatory variables have a nonlinear effect on the dependent variable. The analysis targets the apartments traded in Seoul between 2014 and 2017. Four main physical characteristics of the apartment have been selected for estimating the housing price. The analysis result shows that the determinants of the housing price have nonlinearity, indeed. The number of years from the apartment construction is representative; the housing price tends to decline over time but it dramatically rises between 21 to 39 years due to the reconstruction demand, then the price drops again after that.

Herein we have proposed new scheme which estimates the body core temperature of cow based on measured data from neck-attached smart sensor. Especially, we have considered both schemes which estimate the exact temperature and which detect the unusually high temperature based on machine learning. We have found that the occurrence of high temperature can be detected accurately. The proposed scheme can be used in monitoring of health condition of cow and improving the efficiency of farm management.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

In the comparison experiment, support vector machine (SVM) was applied as machine learning algorithm and convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied as deep learning algorithm. In particular, 2D-CNN considering 2-dimensional spatial information and 3D-CNN with extended time dimension from 2D-CNN were applied as CNN. As a result of the experiment, it was found that the hyper-parameter values of CNN, considering various hyper-parameter, defined in the two study areas were similar compared with SVM. Based on this result, although it takes much time to optimize the model in CNN, it is considered that it is possible to apply transfer learning that can extend optimized CNN model to other regions. Then, in the experiment results with various training sample size, the impact of that on CNN was larger than SVM. In particular, this impact was exaggerated in Illinois State with heterogeneous spatial patterns. In addition, the lowest classification performance of 3D-CNN was presented in Illinois State, which is considered to be due to over-fitting as complexity of the model. That is, the classification performance was relatively degraded due to heterogeneous patterns and noise effect of input data, although the training accuracy of 3D-CNN model was high. This results imply that a proper classification algorithms should be selected considering spatial characteristics of study areas.

Artificial intelligence is evolving through machine learning, and producing artworks on its own. In fact, current artificial intelligence is widelyconsidered an “imitation machine” that learns and imitates past works, rather than being truly “creative machines.” Can such “imitation machine” works be considered artistic acts? According to the current art paradigm, only those who produce “creative” works are regarded as “authors.” An artwork is a product of creativity, not imitation. Whether customary or legal, imitations inherently oppose creation; they are not authentic works.Artificial intelligence produces artworks by algorithms and programs, and programs can be designed to produce something unpredictable. In other words, artificial intelligence can produce “creative” output. Furthermore, it is impossible to create something fundamentally new, given that all creative human activities involve the process of writing their own rules based on acquired knowledge. That is, “creativity” is not only a contradiction in itself but also a mythical concept.According to the current art paradigm, only humans can be considered “creative” authors. However, the concept of authorship is gradually expanding. The notion that artificial intelligence or programmers cannot be creators is challenged. The significance of the problem is less about the “subject” of creation than its “result.” A real program can be “post-gramme” rather than “pro-gramme.” We should consider the collaboration of humans and machines in the machine age. Humans have imitated machines, and machines have imitated humans. In the process, humans have extended beyond their corporealboundaries . Technology has always been the human’s extension. In that sense, it is an opportune time to revisit Foucault's question about authorship, and ask: “Qu’importe qui cree?”",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

In the 1970s, popular novels owned an attractive body and angelic soul and served men with devoted love and sexual pleasure, but did not require any moral responsibility, a fairy tale image, and a Virgin simulacra played as reality. Jung Da-hee, the heroine of A Deeper Sleep than Death, is a simulacra with Gyeonga or Ehwa as model images. The 1970s popular novels show similar gender simulacra.This can be likened to the process of self-propagation and ‘image-fashion’ of the simulacra. In the end, Dahee’s life shows the self-replication of a new model by strengthening immorality and the selfishness of desire and fantasy in the simulacra of Gyeonga and Ewha. The main character of this work, Young-hoon, is initially rejected, but the newly learned love rites his passage.Concentrating on ‘initiation’ in the romance narrative, this novel can be understood as a male growth narrative of the industrialization period. This is a simulacra of Muno in The Hometown of Stars like automatic memory. In the 1970s, the romanticity, assimilation and purity of popular romantic novels played the role of the blind to a reality that was not pure. The rapid expansion of popular culture was the deterrence machine, covering up images of darkness and ice with reflection and purity. A bad society distorts the reality of barbarism by pre-writing pure love. No matter how violent the reality is, it creates an easy fantasy that one can become as clean as the body that is purified every day. In this case, pure love is overestimated and a society that is not pure is underestimated. These societies are both free and violent.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

In particular, CNN(Convolutional Neural Network), which is known as the effective solution for recognizing and classifying images or voices, has been popularly applied to classification and prediction problems. In this study, we investigate the way to apply CNN in business problem solving. Specifically, this study propose to apply CNN to stock market prediction, one of the most challenging tasks in the machine learning research. As mentioned, CNN has strength in interpreting images. Thus, the model proposed in this study adopts CNN as the binary classifier that predicts stock market direction (upward or downward) by using time series graphs as its inputs. That is, our proposal is to build a machine learning algorithm that mimics an experts called 'technical analysts' who examine the graph of past price movement, and predict future financial price movements.Our proposed model named 'CNN-FG(Convolutional Neural Network using Fluctuation Graph)' consists of five steps. In the first step, it divides the dataset into the intervals of 5 days. And then, it creates time series graphs for the divided dataset in step 2. The size of the image in which the graph is drawn is 40 (pixels) × 40 (pixels), and the graph of each independent variable was drawn using different colors.In step 3, the model converts the images into the matrices. Each image is converted into the combination of three matrices in order to express the value of the color using R(red), G(green), and B(blue) scale. In the next step, it splits the dataset of the graph images into training and validation datasets. We used 80% of the total dataset as the training dataset, and the remaining 20% as the validation dataset. And then, CNN classifiers are trained using the images of training dataset in the final step. Regarding the parameters of CNN-FG, we adopted two convolution filters (5 × 5 × 6 and 5 × 5 × 9) in the convolution layer. In the pooling layer, 2 × 2 max pooling filter was used. The numbers of the nodes in two hidden layers were set to, respectively, 900 and 32, and the number of the nodes in the output layer was set to 2(one is for the prediction of upward trend, and the other one is for downward trend). Activation functions for the convolution layer and the hidden layer were set to ReLU(Rectified Linear Unit), and one for the output layer set to Softmax function.To validate our model - CNN-FG, we applied it to the prediction of KOSPI200 for 2,026 days in eight years (from 2009 to 2016). To match the proportions of the two groups in the independent variable (i.e. tomorrow's stock market movement), we selected 1,950 samples by applying random sampling. Finally, we built the training dataset using 80% of the total dataset (1,560 samples), and the validation dataset using 20% (390 samples). The dependent variables of the experimental dataset included twelve technical indicators popularly been used in the previous studies. They include Stochastic %K, Stochastic %D, Momentum, ROC(rate of change), LW %R(Larry William's %R), A/D oscillator(accumulation/distribution oscillator), OSCP(price oscillator), CCI(commodity channel index), and so on. To confirm the superiority of CNN-FG, we compared its prediction accuracy with the ones of other classification models. Experimental results showed that CNN-FG outperforms LOGIT(logistic regression), ANN(artificial neural network), and SVM(support vector machine) with the statistical significance. These empirical results imply that converting time series business data into graphs and building CNN-based classification models using these graphs can be effective from the perspective of prediction accuracy. Thus, this paper sheds a light on how to apply deep learning techniques to the domain of business problem solving.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Especially, the scale of E-commerce industry in which Amazon and E-bay are standing out is exploding in a large way. As E-commerce grows, Customers could get what they want to buy easily while comparing various products because more products have been registered at online shopping malls.However, a problem has arisen with the growth of E-commerce. As too many products have been registered, it has become difficult for customers to search what they really need in the flood of products.When customers search for desired products with a generalized keyword, too many products have come out as a result. On the contrary, few products have been searched if customers type in details of products because concrete product-attributes have been registered rarely.In this situation, recognizing texts in images automatically with a machine can be a solution. Because bulk of product details are written in catalogs as image format, most of product information are not searched with text inputs in the current text-based searching system. It means if information in images can be converted to text format, customers can search products with product-details, which make them shop more conveniently.There are various existing OCR(Optical Character Recognition) programs which can recognize texts in images. But existing OCR programs are hard to be applied to catalog because they have problems in recognizing texts in certain circumstances, like texts are not big enough or fonts are not consistent.Therefore, this research suggests the way to recognize keywords in catalog with the Deep Learning algorithm which is state of the art in image-recognition area from 2010s. Single Shot Multibox Detector(SSD), which is a credited model for object-detection performance, can be used with structures re-designed to take into account the difference of text from object. But there is an issue that SSD model needs a lot of labeled-train data to be trained, because of the characteristic of deep learning algorithms, that it should be trained by supervised-learning. To collect data, we can try labelling location and classification information to texts in catalog manually. But if data are collected manually, many problems would come up. Some keywords would be missed because human can make mistakes while labelling train data. And it becomes too time-consuming to collect train data considering the scale of data needed or costly if a lot of workers are hired to shorten the time. Furthermore, if some specific keywords are needed to be trained, searching images that have the words would be difficult, as well.To solve the data issue, this research developed a program which create train data automatically. This program can make images which have various keywords and pictures like catalog and save location-information of keywords at the same time. With this program, not only data can be collected efficiently, but also the performance of SSD model becomes better. The SSD model recorded 81.99% of recognition rate with 20,000 data created by the program.Moreover, this research had an efficiency test of SSD model according to data differences to analyze what feature of data exert influence upon the performance of recognizing texts in images. As a result, it is figured out that the number of labeled keywords, the addition of overlapped keyword label, the existence of keywords that is not labeled, the spaces among keywords and the differences of background images are related to the performance of SSD model. This test can lead performance improvement of SSD model or other text-recognizing machine based on deep learning algorithm with high-quality data.SSD model which is re-designed to recognize texts in images and the program developed for creating train data are expected to contribute to improvement of searching system in E-co...",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Collecting sufficient labeled data is an expensive and time-consuming task. To build a HAR system in a new environment (i.e., the target domain) with very limited labeled data, it is unfavorable to naively exploit the data or trained classifier model from the existing environment (i.e., the source domain) as it is due to the domain difference. While traditional machine learning approaches are unable to address such distribution mismatch, transfer learning approach leverages the utilization of knowledge from existing well-established source domains that help to build an accurate classifier in the target domain. In this work, we propose a transfer learning approach to create an accurate HAR classifier with very limited data through the multitask neural network. The classifier loss function minimization for source and target domain are treated as two different tasks. The knowledge transfer is performed by simultaneously minimizing the loss function of both tasks using a single neural network model. Furthermore, we utilize the unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner to help the model training. The experiment result shows that the proposed work consistently outperforms existing approaches.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

In order to prevent this, the anti-quarantine authorities have tried various human and material endeavors, but the infectious diseases have continued to occur. Avian influenza is known to be developed in 1878 and it rose as a national issue due to its high lethality. Food and mouth disease is considered as most critical animal infectious disease internationally. In a nation where this disease has not been spread, food and mouth disease is recognized as economic disease or political disease because it restricts international trade by making it complex to import processed and non-processed live stock, and also quarantine is costly. In a society where whole nation is connected by zone of life, there is no way to prevent the spread of infectious disease fully. Hence, there is a need to be aware of occurrence of the disease and to take action before it is distributed.Epidemiological investigation on definite diagnosis target is implemented and measures are taken to prevent the spread of disease according to the investigation results, simultaneously with the confirmation of both human infectious disease and animal infectious disease. The foundation of epidemiological investigation is figuring out to where one has been, and whom he or she has met. In a data perspective, this can be defined as an action taken to predict the cause of disease outbreak, outbreak location, and future infection, by collecting and analyzing geographic data and relation data. Recently, an attempt has been made to develop a prediction model of infectious disease by using Big Data and deep learning technology, but there is no active research on model building studies and case reports. KT and the Ministry of Science and ICT have been carrying out big data projects since 2014 as part of national R &D projects to analyze and predict the route of livestock related vehicles. To prevent animal infectious diseases, the researchers first developed a prediction model based on a regression analysis using vehicle movement data. After that, more accurate prediction model was constructed using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Lasso, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. In particular, the prediction model for 2017 added the risk of diffusion to the facilities, and the performance of the model was improved by considering the hyper-parameters of the modeling in various ways. Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve show that the model constructed in 2017 is superior to the machine learning model. The difference between the2016 model and the 2017 model is that visiting information on facilities such as feed factory and slaughter house, and information on bird livestock, which was limited to chicken and duck but now expanded to goose and quail, has been used for analysis in the later model. In addition, an explanation of the results was added to help the authorities in making decisions and to establish a basis for persuading stakeholders in 2017. This study reports an animal infectious disease prevention system which is constructed on the basis of hazardous vehicle movement, farm and environment Big Data. The significance of this study is that it describes the evolution process of the prediction model using Big Data which is used in the field and the model is expected to be more complete if the form of viruses is put into consideration. This will contribute to data utilization and analysis model development in related field. In addition, we expect that the system constructed in this study will provide more preventive and effective prevention.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Before the Asian financial crisis, the Korean government only analyzed SMEs and tried to improve the forecasting power of a default prediction model, rather than developing various corporate default models. As a result, even large corporations called 'chaebol enterprises' become bankrupt. Even after that, the analysis of past corporate defaults has been focused on specific variables, and when the government restructured immediately after the global financial crisis, they only focused on certain main variables such as 'debt ratio'.A multifaceted study of corporate default prediction models is essential to ensure diverse interests, to avoid situations like the 'Lehman Brothers Case' of the global financial crisis, to avoid total collapse in a single moment.The key variables used in corporate defaults vary over time. This is confirmed by Beaver (1967, 1968) and Altman’s (1968) analysis that Deakins'(1972) study shows that the major factors affecting corporate failure have changed. In Grice's (2001) study, the importance of predictive variables was also found through Zmijewski’s (1984) and Ohlson’s (1980) models. However, the studies that have been carried out in the past use static models. Most of them do not consider the changes that occur in the course of time. Therefore, in order to construct consistent prediction models, it is necessary to compensate the time-dependent bias by means of a time series analysis algorithm reflecting dynamic change.Based on the global financial crisis, which has had a significant impact on Korea, this study is conducted using 10 years of annual corporate data from 2000 to 2009. Data are divided into training data, validation data, and test data respectively, and are divided into 7, 2, and 1 years respectively. In order to construct a consistent bankruptcy model in the flow of time change, we first train a time series deep learning algorithm model using the data before the financial crisis (2000~2006). The parameter tuning of the existing model and the deep learning time series algorithm is conducted with validation data including the financial crisis period (2007~2008). As a result, we construct a model that shows similar pattern to the results of the learning data and shows excellent prediction power. After that, each bankruptcy prediction model is restructured by integrating the learning data and validation data again (2000 ~ 2008), applying the optimal parameters as in the previous validation. Finally, each corporate default prediction model is evaluated and compared using test data (2009) based on the trained models over nine years. Then, the usefulness of the corporate default prediction model based on the deep learning time series algorithm is proved. In addition, by adding the Lasso regression analysis to the existing methods (multiple discriminant analysis, logit model) which select the variables, it is proved that the deep learning time series algorithm model based on the three bundles of variables is useful for robust corporate default prediction.The definition of bankruptcy used is the same as that of Lee (2015). Independent variables include financial information such as financial ratios used in previous studies. Multivariate discriminant analysis, logit model, and Lasso regression model are used to select the optimal variable group. The influence of the Multivariate discriminant analysis model proposed by Altman (1968), the Logit model proposed by Ohlson (1980), the non-time series machine learning algorithms, and the deep learning time series algorithms are compared.In the case of corporate data, there are limitations of 'nonlinear variables', 'multi-collinearity' of variables, and 'lack of data'.

This study estimated the mastery profile of each cognitive factor of the reading comprehension of non-literary texts with the result of the evaluation of reading comprehension made by producing a tool for the evaluation of reading comprehension based on the developed Q-Matrix, utilizing a cognitive diagnosis model.Next, by running a machine learning process, putting the result of the actual evaluation Score and the proficiency profile of each cognitive factor of the reading comprehension of non-literary texts into the artificial neural network model, respectively, as the input value and output value, this study would develop an algorithm in which the artificial neural network model itself estimates a proficiency profile by cognitive factor according to the result of the test of reading comprehension.

The NMT model consists of a process in which the computer reads the original text in sentence units and then generates the optimal translation corresponding to the sentence using the parameters obtained by deep learning. In the process of finding the optimal translation there is no need to construct separate translation dictionaries or translation patterns because the computer will learn on its own with parallel corpus. The NMT model is simpler and more general than the existing models.  For the quality of neural network machine translation, research has been conducted mainly on English. However, the research on the translation quality of non-English languages has received relatively little attention. Especially, it is not an exaggeration to say that the study on Chinese - Korean NMT quality has not yet been successful. In this paper, we analyzed how accurately the NMT translates Chinese - Korean sentences. The programs used to evaluate the accuracy of translation are GNMT, N2MT, Baidu NMT. For the translation evaluation, we selected 370 sentences from Chinese textbooks, academic papers, newspapers, TV scripts. And the machine translation results were evaluated in terms of word translation, phrase translation, and sentence translation. According to the result of the evaluation, the accuracy of N2MT and Baidu NMT is higer than that of GNMT for the basic colloquial expressions. However, in translating practical sentences such as newspaper reports, product manuals, web documents, business expressions, and TV conversations, the accuracy of GNMT and N2MT was higher than that of Baidu NMT.  In this paper, we also discussed how to use the NMT effectively. It is true that the NMT model has improved the translation quality. However, it still does not produce very high quality translations for the source texts. It will not be easy for machine translation to completely replace human translation in the future. But machine translation programs can be an excellent aid to human translation. The NMT model learns the translation data on its own and can predict the optimal translation. Therefore, if the NMT model is specialized for the purpose of the translator, it can be used as a convenient translation tool. Developing a translation model based on the neural network theory will contribute to enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the translation.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

The stock price forecasting research is classified into structured data and unstructured data, and it is divided into technical analysis, fundamental analysis and media effect analysis in detail.  In the big data era, research on stock price prediction combining big data is actively underway. Based on a large number of data, stock prediction research mainly focuses on machine learning techniques. Especially, research methods that combine the effects of media are attracting attention recently, among which researches that analyze online news and utilize online news to forecast stock prices are becoming main.  Previous studies predicting stock prices through online news are mostly sentiment analysis of news, making different corpus for each company, and making a dictionary that predicts stock prices by recording responses according to the past stock price. Therefore, existing studies have examined the impact of online news on individual companies. For example, stock movements of Samsung Electronics are predicted with only online news of Samsung Electronics. In addition, a method of considering influences among highly relevant companies has also been studied recently. For example, stock movements of Samsung Electronics are predicted with news of Samsung Electronics and a highly related company like LG Electronics.These previous studies examine the effects of news of industrial sector with homogeneity on the individual company. In the previous studies, homogeneous industries are classified according to the Global Industrial Classification Standard. In other words, the existing studies were analyzed under the assumption that industries divided into Global Industrial Classification Standard have homogeneity.  However, existing studies have limitations in that they do not take into account influential companies with high relevance or reflect the existence of heterogeneity within the same Global Industrial Classification Standard sectors. As a result of our examining the various sectors, it can be seen that there are sectors that show the industrial sectors are not a homogeneous group. To overcome these limitations of existing studies that do not reflect heterogeneity, our study suggests a methodology that reflects the heterogeneous effects of the industrial sector that affect the stock price by applying k-means clustering. Multiple Kernel Learning is mainly used to integrate data with various characteristics. Multiple Kernel Learning has several kernels, each of which receives and predicts different data. To incorporate effects of target firm and its relevant firms simultaneously, we used Multiple Kernel Learning. Each kernel was assigned to predict stock prices with variables of financial news of the industrial group divided by the target firm, K-means cluster analysis.  In order to prove that the suggested methodology is appropriate, experiments were conducted through three years of online news and stock prices.  The results of this study are as follows. (1) We confirmed that the information of the industrial sectors related to target company also contains meaningful information to predict stock movements of target company and confirmed that machine learning algorithm has better predictive power when considering the news of the relevant companies and target company’s news together. (2) It is important to predict stock movements with varying number of clusters according to the level of homogeneity in the industrial sector. In other words, when stock prices are homogeneous in industrial sectors, it is important to use relational effect at the level of industry group without analyzing clusters or to use it in small number of clusters.

Thus our fire prediction method measures distances between two buildings using weighted Euclidean distance function.

Nowadays it creates something new. Just a few years ago, artificial intelligence would not have thought of composing and drawing pictures by itself. Smart artificial intelligence produces works similar to human beings in the fields of  music and art, which were estimated as human’s creative area. Artificial intelligence even plays a role in the development of new drugs and computer programs. The paper starts from the question whether artificial intelligence should be regarded as a human tool or artifacts of artificial intelligence should be treated as protected inventions under the patent law.  Thus the paper focuses on the artifacts produced by artificial intelligence and how to protect them. Unlike the protection by copyright law, there would be considerable controversy about the claim that artifacts of artificial intelligence should be protected by patent law. Nevertheless the author intends to insist the necessity of protection because artificial intelligence may have meaningful legal impact. The pace of technological progress is much quicker than that had been in the past. However laws have a tendency of coping with the phenomenon slowly. The author wish to share results through the promotion of science and technology with my contemporaries.  The paper briefly reviewed technical features of artificial intelligence. In particular the author reviewed the operating principles of AlphaGo Zero, which can create a new way without human intervention through reinforcement learning. In the case of artificial intelligence, the creation of artworks without any human intervention is likely to correspond to the conceptual invention of Article 2 (1) of the patent law. Artificial intelligence can create new outcomes through self-learning, as seen in the use of artificial intelligence in the pharmaceutical industry and computer programs. There are two results that could be considered meaningful in the process of artificial intelligence. First, the ability of processing data in aspects of time and amount of data. It is superior than general computers due to self-learning. Second, some unpredicted unique results through its self-learning process. The first result may be difficult to be a meaningful invention under the patent law. However,  the second result may not be handled just as a tool. It is difficult to say that it is a natural phenomenon. If so, the result of artificial intelligence could be protected as inventions under the patent law. Considering the possibility of artificial intelligence technology being used in industries, the paper tried to think about how to look at artificial intelligence output. The author examined whether the patent law could be applied to artifacts of artificial intelligence. Therefore the author reviewed  artificial intelligence related technologies in detail and reviewed the concept of the invention focused on the United States. After that, the author examined whether the concept of invention could be applied to the case of artificial intelligence products that are thought to be meaningful as inventions.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Given the fact that there are numerous determinants and forecasting models for household loans, and that the determi-nants differ depending on the type of household loans, this study sets out the density forecasting algorithm based on Bayesian Machine Learning. which con-sists of a variable learning process, a model learning process, and a forecasting combination process. We ﬁnd bank mortgage loans are largely predicted by the loan rates, the volume of apartments to be moved in, and the number of apart-ment units to be sold. while the key determinants of bank credit loans are the employment rate and Jeon-se price index. On the other hand, the non-bank mort-gage loans are largely determined by the loan rates and the ratio of apartment sales prices relative to Jeon-se prices.

Evaluating Pedicle-Screw Instrumentation Using Decision-Tree Analysis Based on Pullout Strength,2018,"['Pedicle screws', 'Pullout strength', 'Osteoporosis', 'Machine learning', 'Decision-support']",,"Study Design: A biomechanical study of pedicle-screw pullout strength.Purpose: To develop a decision tree based on pullout strength for evaluating pedicle-screw instrumentation.Overview of Literature: Clinically, a surgeon’s understanding of the holding power of a pedicle screw is based on perioperative intuition (which is like insertion torque) while inserting the screw. This is a subjective feeling that depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. With the advent of robotic surgery, there is an urgent need for the creation of a patient-specific surgical planning system.A learning-based predictive model is needed to understand the sensitivity of pedicle-screw holding power to various factors.Methods: Pullout studies were carried out on rigid polyurethane foam, representing extremely osteoporotic to normal bone for different insertion depths and angles of a pedicle screw. The results of these experimental studies were used to build a pullout-strength predictor and a decision tree using a machine-learning approach.Results: Based on analysis of variance, it was found that all the factors under study had a significant effect (p <0.05) on the holding power of a pedicle screw. Of the various machine-learning techniques, the random forest regression model performed well in predicting the pullout strength and in creating a decision tree. Performance was evaluated, and a correlation coefficient of 0.99 was obtained between the observed and predicted values. The mean and standard deviation of the normalized predicted pullout strength for the confirmation experiment using the current model was 1.01±0.04.Conclusions: The random forest regression model was used to build a pullout-strength predictor and decision tree. The model was able to predict the holding power of a pedicle screw for any combination of density, insertion depth, and insertion angle for the chosen range. The decision-tree model can be applied in patient-specific surgical planning and a decision-support system for spine-fusion surgery.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

The legal domain is also not free from these changes. In particular, the innovation of legal services by artificial intelligence algorithms has renewed the aspect of the legal services market, and the expectation for the positive effects is great. On the other hand, the number of peoples who think artificial intelligence algorithm will dominate the human world has increased, and such an indication will emerge from replacing the profession that human beings were responsible for. It is also expected that artificial algorithms will replace attorneys in law and even artificial intelligence algorithms will replace judges.The problem is that people who are not engineers of artificial intelligence algorithms are pouring out this view. Artificial intelligence developers who knows the limitations of artificial intelligence algorithms and understands the difficulties of the development process do not expect artificial intelligence algorithms to dominate human world.Artificial intelligence is not omnipotent. It is only an algorithm, and it is implemented as a computer program. It is merely a computer program that needs to be specifically coded. Sometimes it also shows performance exceeding human prediction range through machine learning. However, the specific implementation target is a problem of a closed environment with clear rules such as a quiz show, go or a arcade game, and it is difficult to say that the complexity of the real world is the same.In this paper, I look at whether artificial intelligence algorithm could replace the judge.In addition, there is much debate about how the world would change by the artificial intelligence algorithm. However, there is no discussion on how to change the world by artificial intelligence algorithm. I tried to explore the possibility of implementing judgement machine.

Many experts anticipate that the border line dividing human being and machine could be disappeared due to the developments of ICT(Information and Communications Technology), AI(Artificial Intelligence) and bio technology. A lot researches argue that intelligence of computers will outperform that of human being from 2030s and knowledge up-loading technology onto a human brain would be realized from 2040s. In this paper in order to grasp transition trends from present to ‘post human times’, previous studies were searched and analyzed focusing on transition from industrial society to information society. These works have been categorized into ‘technology determinism’ and ‘social theory’. Linking this previous research works, social science approach predicting the changes of social structure of ‘post human times’ was derived as ‘technology utopia,’ ‘human existence (labor) obsolescence’ and ‘extension of capitalism structural contradiction’ as well. Deleuze argued that “arts is another mean of philosophy, gives vitality onto philosophy and has role figuring out a abstract concept onto definite images.” In this paper issues from social science prediction approaches about relationship between human being and artificial intelligence (das andere) were compared with those from video contents. For this purpose four video contents developed made after 2000s were selected. From this analysis artificial intelligence, a self image of human being, from time series of view, functionality of learning, recognition, sentiment, and body have been highlighted with parallel and ‘rhyzome’ in these contents. In addition self-consciousness and mind of artificial intelligence of AI have been realized in video contents, incrementally.

This discussion focuses on the humanity of AI. For this I examined literary works written by AI in terms of three attributes of humanity: creativity, affectivity/sensibility, and morality. Short stories and scenarios written by AI still have considerable limitations compared with man-made works. Although AI has been able to write short stories and scenarios through data input, Deep-Learning based language processing and logical reasoning, it is impossible to create 100% original work without human intervention. It is possible to write a certain amount of articles by analyzing the narrative patterns of existing works and making logical reasoning, but the amount is very short and has not yet exceeded the level of ‘creative imitation’. Therefore, it is not at a stage to recognize AI as the subject of creation. The poetry has a strong subjective nature and emotional action among artistic branches of literature. The poetry creation of AI was done in two ways. One way is that AI creates a poem by seeing photographs presented by human after learned poems of a poet by Deep-Learning. Another way is that AI completes a piece of poem in a way which responds to a line of poem which a person presents. However, it is not a stage in which subjective creation of poetry is done without human help. The AI-based literary creation will develop rapidly in the near future. It is possible to develop creativity that is human-like as well as rapid and diverse literary creation based on human sensitivity and morality. A professional AI artist will appear in the near future. However, the creativity of AI is also in danger of being inhuman and anti-ethical. Appropriate regulations and discipline are naturally necessary. From now on, it is necessary for us to overcome the humanism of rejecting the machine or perceiving the machine as a means and a tool in the human-centered viewpoint. We need to have the post-humanism in pursuit of symbiosis through cooperation and mutual communication between man and machine.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

In previous studies, prediction models have been proposed by applying or combining statistical and machine learning-based techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent prediction model based on the simulated annealing which is one of the well-known optimization techniques. The simulated annealing is known to have comparable optimization performance to the genetic algorithms. Nevertheless, since there has been little research on the prediction and classification of business decision-making problems using the simulated annealing, it is meaningful to confirm the usefulness of the proposed model in business analytics. In this study, we use the combined model of simulated annealing and machine learning to select the input features of the bankruptcy prediction model. Typical types of combining optimization and machine learning techniques are feature selection, feature weighting, and instance selection. This study proposes a combining model for feature selection, which has been studied the most. In order to confirm the superiority of the proposed model in this study, we apply the real-world financial data of the Korean companies and analyze the results. The results show that the predictive accuracy of the proposed model is better than that of the naïve model. Notably, the performance is significantly improved as compared with the traditional decision tree, random forests, artificial neural network, SVM, and logistic regression analysis.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

It would be important, because artificial Intelligence's logical and analytical thinking, relied on big-data and humane intuitive thinking are going to help human beings and machine co-work in near future. This author has studied characteristics of intuitive thinking and examined how the intuitive thinking would provide a new perspective on instructional design. In order to do this study, this author has examined intuition as strong points of human intelligence, and taken sensible, unreasonable, overall, emotional, challenging, self-convicting, and momentary characteristics of intuitive thinking. And this author has explained that intuitive thinking would be accepted for human unreasonableness in future education and it would be an alternative for human personality and dignity not just to be mechanical human. In addition, this author has found that intuitive thinking has provided following implications in instructional design knowledge-base. At first, an instructional designer is a designer with creative, emotional, intuitive design capacity. Secondly, a learner is an intact person who is capable of learning with her or his inner strength. Thus, the instructional design should be based on finding her or his capabilities. Thirdly, educational contents should satisfy a leaner’s desire and would urge her or him for another learning. Fourthly, educational course and practice should foster a broad understanding to look at a big picture, so that there should be generous environment for learners’ minor errors. Fifthly, embodied cognitional strategies should actively be taken to use body sense and emotions. Sixthly, enough media should not be given for learners to think free and to examine small data. Accepting intuitive thinking in instructional design should not exclude reasonable discussion, while it would embrace alternatively unreasonable understanding and experience, such as emotions, imagination, and intuition. It would help to understand totally reasonable and unreasonable characteristics for education, and then provide opportunities to extend to design everyday education without form.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Therefore, sentences that are mass-produced for the Fourth Industrial Revolution will also be automatically converted to Big Data by machine learning, synthesis analysis by artificial intelligence. It will stimulate the process by which the Fourth Industrial Revolution is positioned in the minds of people as if they have a clear reality. This process is acting as part of a mechanism in which discourses supporting the Fourth Industrial Revolution are always set to win games. And that slogan will act as a practical force to substantially move the government’s administrative power and to focus corporate capital.Today’s technological innovation also offers unprecedented possibilities to enable artificial intelligence to pattern fields such as literature(art). In this regard, as literature(art) is attributed to the domain based on the human’s own emotional capacity of creativity, and as the various desires, practices, and discourses around it become uniform and simplified, it will be reduced to an analytical target. Such technical conditions are well developed and data is also accumulated. Only capital is not invested in earnest.We have long since lived as post-human-cyborgs(machines +humans). The common sense of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, that artificial intelligence might outweigh humans, and the productivity increase based on the unprecedented automation that it will bring will liberate man from the curse of labor or vice versa, conceals such facts in the fantasy that the realm of human beings, centering on art, creativity and labor, exists as reality and continues to depend on it. While we feel self-satisfaction to such humanistic fantasies, the capitalist who wishes to endure the permanent operation and infinite proliferation of labor-free capital by eliminating all the labor of labor in the whole process of preliminary investigation, data analysis, communication and production-distribution. The long desire of the capitalist will not stop the covert intervention, which is linked to all non-person devices, including the state’s science and technology policy.Therefore, rather than sticking to the slogan of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we pay more attention to the way in which all non-person devices intervene and operate in a way that allows us to accept the conditions of human+machine today without any sense of discomfort. We need to calmly reflect on the fact that it was given in earnest in the form of an unknown territory and gap. It is also necessary to confirm how the unknown area and gap work in the complementary and regulatory relationship between man and machine. Kim Ae-Ran’s short story, “Where Would You Like To Go?” is an example of the fact that literature is still a valid form of reflection on issues such as how we can respond to these problems.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

An Intelligent System Approach for Probabilistic Volume Rendering Using Hierarchical 3D Convolutional Sparse Coding,2018,,,"<P>In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based voxel classification method for highly-accurate volume rendering. Unlike conventional voxel classification methods that incorporate intensity-based features, the proposed method employs dictionary based features learned directly from the input data using hierarchical multi-scale 3D convolutional sparse coding, a novel extension of the state-of-the-art learning-based sparse feature representation method. The proposed approach automatically generates high-dimensional feature vectors in up to 75 dimensions, which are then fed into an intelligent system built on a random forest classifier for accurately classifying voxels from only a handful of selection scribbles made directly on the input data by the user. We apply the probabilistic transfer function to further customize and refine the rendered result. The proposed method is more intuitive to use and more robust to noise in comparison with conventional intensity-based classification methods. We evaluate the proposed method using several synthetic and real-world volume datasets, and demonstrate the methods usability through a user study.</P>",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Then, to more accurately understand their tweets, we analyze all types of content in tweets, i.e., texts and emoticons, and images, thus develop a multimodal sentiment analysis method. In the proposed method, two single-modal analyses first are performed to extract the users’ moods hidden in texts and images: a lexicon-based and learning-based text classifier and a learning-based image classifier. Thereafter, the extracted moods from the respective analyses are combined into a tweet mood and aggregated a daily mood. As a result, the proposed method generates a user daily mood flow graph, which allows us for monitoring the mood trend of users more intuitively. For evaluation, we perform two sets of experiment. First, we collect the data sets of 40,447 data. We evaluate our method via comparing the state-of-the-art techniques. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed multimodal analysis method outperforms other baselines and our own methods using text-based tweets or images only. Furthermore, to evaluate the potential of the proposed method in monitoring users’ mood trend, we tested the proposed method with 40 depressive users and 40 normal users. It proves that the proposed method can be effectively used in finding depressed users.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Handicraft, which women needed to learn to be ‘self-sufficient’ during daily life, was technologically reborn during a period of economic development, industrialization, and through the Japanese occupation of Korea. The majority of the economic development happened in a short period of time during which events such as the 1) liberation of Korea from Japan occupation, 2) Korean War of 1950, and 3) post-war military dictatorship/rule by military officers brought women whom had all made personal sacrifices (to support the success of their male counterparts) and were marginalized in education to the forefront of the businesses. Women introduced to business world, they obtained a means of gaining effective employment and earning income through their handicraft skills. Regular use their handicraft skills resulted in the progressive evolution of handicraft techniques throughout Korea.  Korean women remained very active during these times of economic development and industrialization by earning income and assuming responsibility for the family’s finances. However, the majority of responsibilities held by women went largely unnoticed by the rest of the country. Hand sewing was largely replaced the emergence of the sewing machine. However, hand sewing remained as a critical talent within the skillset of many women. Even in today’s world of machined (i.e., sewing machine) clothing products previously pulled together by hand (manually), handicrafts continue to maintain a presence in Korea’s “ready-to-go” wear and industrial products mainly as a result of generations adjusting to the handicraft needs of their social environments/cultures and by continuing to abide by the tradition of passing the skills from generation to generation (i.e., mother to daughter). Due to the negligence of handicrafts in previous generations, it is crucial in today’s culture to re-recognize and re-incorporate these skills (i.e., hand sewing, needlework, and embroidery) into the daily lives of Korean women.  This thesis follows selected women in the period of economic development (discussed above) as subjects of study on how the advancement of technology in the field of handicrafts has impacted their lives.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Andrew, the protagonist in the novel, is a figuration of artificial intelligence robot which is expected to emerge in forty to fifty years. He presents similar characteristics to a human being that has intelligence and emotion, capable of self-learning and evolving. Furthermore, developing with the passage of time, he requests the legal rights as a member of a society that is equal to a human being, after he recognizes his machine-identity defined by human beings. Therefore, the emergence of an AI robot that demands own social and legal rights seems probable in future society.Actually, if an AI robot like Andrew is to live among human beings, its ontological meaning and social status should be regulatedanew for the coexistence of the two. From this perspective, it is robot ethics and rights that foregrounds recent discussion.

Feature-Based Hand Gesture Recognition Using an FMCW Radar and its Temporal Feature Analysis,2018,,,"<P>In this paper, feature-based gesture recognition in a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar system is introduced. We obtain a range-Doppler map (RDM) from raw signals of FMCW radar and generate a variety of features from the RDM. The features are broadly defined to reflect radar-specific characteristics as well as statistical values commonly used in machine learning. Among these radar features, those that are highly correlated with gesture recognition are selected by the proposed feature selection algorithm, which is a wrapper-based feature selection algorithm incorporated with a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QEA). Furthermore, the information factor based on the minimum redundancy maximum relevance criterion is applied to QEA in order to find feature subsets effectively. The proposed algorithm is able to extract from all feature sets feature subsets related to gesture recognition, and improves the gesture recognition accuracy of the FMCW radar system. In addition, we analyze which features of the radar are helpful for gesture recognition and perform effective gesture recognition using the features determined through feature analysis.</P>",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

In Buddhist texts, indriyas have been described usually as the ontological background of the sentient beings. It means that they are the reason why the sentient beings are ‘sentient.’ However, the technical development in the age of 4th Industrial Revolution, such as AI (Artificial Intelligence) or IoT (Internet of Things), has enabled investing machines with a kind of sensing power as faculty of senses. Moreover, the AI nowadays can analyze, patternize or even judge through the algorithm of deep learning, and this direction of technological development makes ambiguous the boundaries between human and machine.In this paper, I would like to discuss shortly about indriyas of the sentient (human) and the insentient beings (machine) through some arguments represented in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, especially in its second chapter, the Indriyanirdeśa. Therefore, first, in the second chapter, I investigate the meanings and some arguments on indriyas in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya.

Meanwhile, the UCL manages end-to-end service connection and service context from a user performance point of view. The proposed model can support nonuniform service binding and its real-time adaptation using meta-objects. Furthermore, it supports intelligent service-context management using a supervised and reinforcement learning-based machine learning framework.

Yet how to attract different audiences for event organizers to these events remains a challenge. In search of effective event marketing strategies, artists and cultural organizations increasingly rely on social media tools, such as Facebook, Twitter and Weibo (a Chinese microblog). Through an analysis of microblogging data collected through the Application Programming Interface (API) and web scraping, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of museums’ Weibo usage for attracting visitors in the city of Beijing. Applying a machine-learning algorithm and conducting a Kendall’s Tau test, we build a correlation between the degree of an account’s online activity and the frequency of onsite visits by the public.

In order to decipher the systems-level mechanism of multiple ingredients of P. ginseng, a novel approach is needed beyond conventional reductive analysis. We aim to review the systems-level mechanism of P. ginseng by adopting novel analytical framework-network pharmacology. Here, we constructed a compound-target network of P. ginseng using experimentally validated and machine learning-based prediction results. The targets of the network were analyzed in terms of related biological process, pathways, and diseases. The majority of targets were found to be related with primary metabolic process, signal transduction, nitrogen compound metabolic process, blood circulation, immune system process, cell-cell signaling, biosynthetic process, and neurological system process.

In text classification field, there are different kinds of techniques available such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes Algorithm, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network.  However, while dealing with huge amount of text data, model performance and accuracy becomes a challenge. According to the type of words used in the corpus and type of features created for classification, the performance of a text classification model can be varied. Most of the attempts are been made based on proposing a new algorithm or modifying an existing algorithm. This kind of research can be said already reached their certain limitations for further improvements. In this study, aside from proposing a new algorithm or modifying the algorithm, we focus on searching a way to modify the use of data. It is widely known that classifier performance is influenced by the quality of training data upon which this classifier is built. The real world datasets in most of the time contain noise, or in other words noisy data, these can actually affect the decision made by the classifiers built from these data. In this study, we consider that the data from different domains, which is heterogeneous data might have the characteristics of noise which can be utilized in the classification process.  In order to build the classifier, machine learning algorithm is performed based on the assumption that the characteristics of training data and target data are the same or very similar to each other. However, in the case of unstructured data such as text, the features are determined according to the vocabularies included in the document. If the viewpoints of the learning data and target data are different, the features may be appearing different between these two data. In this study, we attempt to improve the classification accuracy by strengthening the robustness of the document classifier through artificially injecting the noise into the process of constructing the document classifier.  With data coming from various kind of sources, these data are likely formatted differently. These cause difficulties for traditional machine learning algorithms because they are not developed to recognize different type of data representation at one time and to put them together in same generalization. Therefore, in order to utilize heterogeneous data in the learning process of document classifier, we apply semi-supervised learning in our study. However, unlabeled data might have the possibility to degrade the performance of the document classifier. Therefore, we further proposed a method called Rule Selection-Based Ensemble Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithm (RSESLA) to select only the documents that contributing to the accuracy improvement of the classifier. RSESLA creates multiple views by manipulating the features using different types of classification models and different types of heterogeneous data. The most confident classification rules will be selected and applied for the final decision making. In this paper, three different types of real-world data sources were used, which are news, twitter and blogs.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

The deep learning technique which had been applied in competitions of the International Conference on Image Recognition Technology(ILSVR) and AlphaGo is Convolution Neural Network(CNN). CNN is characterized in that the input image is divided into small sections to recognize the partial features and combine them to recognize as a whole. Deep learning technologies are expected to bring a lot of changes in our lives, but until now, its applications have been limited to image recognition and natural language processing.  The use of deep learning techniques for business problems is still an early research stage. If their performance is proved, they can be applied to traditional business problems such as future marketing response prediction, fraud transaction detection, bankruptcy prediction, and so on. So, it is a very meaningful experiment to diagnose the possibility of solving business problems using deep learning technologies based on the case of online shopping companies which have big data, are relatively easy to identify customer behavior and has high utilization values. Especially, in online shopping companies, the competition environment is rapidly changing and becoming more intense. Therefore, analysis of customer behavior for maximizing profit is becoming more and more important for online shopping companies.  In this study, we propose CNN model of Heterogeneous Information Integration using CNN as a way to improve the predictive power of customer behavior in online shopping enterprises. In order to propose a model that optimizes the performance, which is a model that learns from the convolution neural network of the multi-layer perceptron structure by combining structured and unstructured information, this model uses heterogeneous information integration, unstructured information vector conversion, ‘multi-layer perceptron design, and evaluate the performance of each architecture, and confirm the proposed model based on the results. In addition, the target variables for predicting customer behavior are defined as six binary classification problems: re-purchaser, churn, frequent shopper, frequent refund shopper, high amount shopper, high discount shopper.  In order to verify the usefulness of the proposed model, we conducted experiments using actual data of domestic specific online shopping company. This experiment uses actual transactions, customers, and VOC data of specific online shopping company in Korea. Data extraction criteria are defined for 47,947 customers who registered at least one VOC in January 2011 (1 month). The customer profiles of these customers, as well as a total of 19 months of trading data from September 2010 to March 2012, and VOCs posted for a month are used. The experiment of this study is divided into two stages. In the first step, we evaluate three architectures that affect the performance of the proposed model and select optimal parameters. We evaluate the performance with the proposed model.  Experimental results show that the proposed model, which combines both structured and unstructured information, is superior compared to NBC(Naïve Bayes classification), SVM(Support vector machine), and ANN(Artificial neural network). Therefore, it is significant that the use of unstructured information contributes to predict customer behavior, and that CNN can be applied to solve business problems as well as image recognition and natural language processing problems. It can be confirmed through experiments that CNN is more effective in understanding and interpreting the meaning of context in text VOC data. And it is significant that the empirical research based on the actual data of the e-commerce company can extract very meaningful information from the VOC data written in the text format directly by the customer in the prediction of the customer behavior.

A methodology to derive global maps of leaf traits using remote sensing and climate data,2018,"['Plant traits', 'Machine learning', 'Random forests', 'Remote sensing', 'Plant ecology', 'Climate', 'MODIS', 'Landsat']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>This paper introduces a modular processing chain to derive global high-resolution maps of leaf traits. In particular, we present global maps at 500 m resolution of specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content per dry mass, and leaf nitrogen/phosphorus ratio. The processing chain exploits machine learning techniques along with optical remote sensing data (MODIS/Landsat) and climate data for gap filling and up-scaling of in-situ measured leaf traits. The chain first uses random forests regression with surrogates to fill gaps in the database (> 45<I>%</I> of missing entries) and maximizes the global representativeness of the trait dataset. Plant species are then aggregated to Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Next, the spatial abundance of PFTs at MODIS resolution (500 m) is calculated using Landsat data (30 m). Based on these PFT abundances, representative trait values are calculated for MODIS pixels with nearby trait data. Finally, different regression algorithms are applied to globally predict trait estimates from these MODIS pixels using remote sensing and climate data. The methods were compared in terms of precision, robustness and efficiency. The best model (random forests regression) shows good precision (normalized RMSE≤ 20<I>%</I>) and goodness of fit (averaged Pearson's correlation R = 0.78) in any considered trait. Along with the estimated global maps of leaf traits, we provide associated uncertainty estimates derived from the regression models. The process chain is modular, and can easily accommodate new traits, data streams (traits databases and remote sensing data), and methods. The machine learning techniques applied allow attribution of information gain to data input and thus provide the opportunity to understand trait-environment relationships at the plant and ecosystem scales. The new data products – the gap-filled trait matrix, a global map of PFT abundance per MODIS gridcells and the high-resolution global leaf trait maps – are complementary to existing large-scale observations of the land surface and we therefore anticipate substantial contributions to advances in quantifying, understanding and prediction of the Earth system.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Presented a modular process chain for plant trait mapping including local effects </LI> <LI>  High-resolution global maps of leaf traits by fusing measured trait data, LANDSAT and MODIS </LI> <LI>  Scope for testing and parameterizing trait-enabled Earth System models </LI> <LI>  Implications for land management and Earth system science applications </LI> </UL> </P>",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
On the Performance of Cuckoo Search and Bat Algorithms Based Instance Selection Techniques for SVM Speed Optimization with Application to e-Fraud Detection,2018,"['Support Vector Machines', 'classification', 'machine learning', 'phishing email', 'spam email']",,"Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a well-known machine learning classification algorithm, which has been widely applied to many data mining problems, with good accuracy. However, SVM classification speed decreases with increase in dataset size. Some applications, like video surveillance and intrusion detection, requires a classifier to be trained very quickly, and on large datasets. Hence, this paper introduces two filter-based instance selection techniques for optimizing SVM training speed. Fast classification is often achieved at the expense of classification accuracy, and some applications, such as phishing and spam email classifiers, are very sensitive to slight drop in classification accuracy. Hence, this paper also introduces two wrapper-based instance selection techniques for improving SVM predictive accuracy and training speed. The wrapper and filter based techniques are inspired by Cuckoo Search Algorithm and Bat Algorithm. The proposed techniques are validated on three popular e-fraud types: credit card fraud, spam email and phishing email. In addition, the proposed techniques are validated on 20 other datasets provided by UCI data repository. Moreover, statistical analysis is performed and experimental results reveals that the filter-based and wrapper-based techniques significantly improved SVM classification speed.

Assessing the readability of fiction: A corpus analysis and readability ranking of 200 English fiction texts,2018,"['readability', 'text complexity', 'fiction', 'machine learning', 'computational linguistics', 'corpus linguistics']",,"Standard readability measures are based on the readability of non-fiction texts. This means that the validity of the measures when applied to fiction texts is questionable. Thus, the scores given to fiction texts using such indicesmay be invalid when used by English teachers to identify fiction texts of appropriate difficulty for students with various reading ability levels. This paper attempts to address this problem by 1) developing a readability measure specifically designed for fiction texts and 2) applying it to 200 English fiction texts. A corpus, consisting of 100 adults  and 100 children s texts, is used for the analysis. In the initial modeling, several standard readability measures are used as variables, and machine learning is used to create a classifier which is able to classify the corpus with an accuracy of 84%. A second classifier is then created using linguistic variables rather than standard readability measures. The latter classifier is able to classify the corpus with an accuracy of 89%, indicating that the standard readability measures are less accurate in classifying fiction texts than linguistic variables. Due to its higher accuracy, the latter classifier is then used to provide a linear complexity or  readability  rank for each text. The ranking using the linguistic-based classifier provides an more accurate method of determining which texts to choose for students according to their reading levels than the standard readability measures. Importantly, the ranking instantiates a fine-grained increase in complexity. This means that the ranking can be used by an English teacher to selecta sequence of texts that represent an increasing challenge to a student without there being a frustratingly discrete rise in difficulty.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

In this paper, we proposed a robust Hybrid Machine Character (HMC) method to classify the targets from the clutters in the infrared images for the various environments. The proposed HMC method adopts human’s multiple personality utilization and the CNN ensemble method to classify the targets in the ground and marine environments. This method uses an advantage of the each environmental training model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has better success rate to classify the targets and clutters than previously proposed CNN classification method.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Due to its narrow range and small population, it is necessary to protect its habitats by identifying it as Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) adopted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In this paper, we estimated potential natural habitats for H. asiatica using maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and identified candidate sites for KBA based on the model results. MaxEnt is a machine learning algorithm that can predict habitats for species of interest unbiasedly with presence-only data. This property is particularly useful for the study area where data collection via a field survey is unavailable. We trained MaxEnt using 38 locations of H. asiatica and 11 environmental variables that measured climate, topography, and vegetation status of the study area which encompassed all locations of the border region between South and North Korea. Results showed that the potential habitats where the occurrence probabilities of H. asiatica exceeded 0.5 were 778 km², and the KBA candidate area identified by taking into account existing protected areas was 1,321 km². Of 11 environmental variables, elevation, annual average precipitation, average precipitation in growing seasons, and the average temperature in the coldest month had impacts on habitat selection, indicating that H. asiatica prefers cool regions at a relatively high elevation.

And, detection results from both McMaster algorithm, a well known incident detection algorithm, and the Naive Bayes algorithm, developed in this study, were compared. As a result of comparison, Naive Bayes algorithm showed less negative effect and better detect rate (DR) than the McMaster algorithm. However, as DR increases, so did false alarm rate (FAR).

Big Data and Doing Research in the Management Discipline,2018,"['Big Data Science', 'Causal Inference', 'Machine Learning', 'Theory']",,"We argue that big data should be understood as an indispensable element in a wider context of big data science that also includes machine learning and results interpretations. By addressing this wider context, we examine the differences between big data science and modern sciences in general and management discipline in particular. While the former adopts data-driven approach to enhance predictive accuracy, the latter adopts theory-driven approach to produce causal explanation. Data-driven approach in conjunction with machine learning strives to enhance the predictive accuracy by allowing big data to choose a set of parameters on its own under rather loose assumptions and learning processes. In contrast, management discipline emphasizes the role of theories in deriving testable hypotheses and encourages scholars to present compelling arguments without explicitly referring to data to be used for estimation at a later stage. This implies that management discipline may not benefit much from big data science in doing academic research. But we believe that big data may prove helpful for the management discipline if we carefully identify small but meaningful patterns that are not easily detected in small data.

Newton also stated that color is a mechanical and measurable attribute. A century later, Johann Goethe conducted a series of experiments for analyzing the nature of color. In contrast to Newton’s theory, Goethe postulated that the color theory should address the subjective and psychological impacts of color on human beings. Goethe’s principle has significantly influenced the contemporary philosophical and artistic approaches to the color theory. In this study, based on Goethe’s color theory, the authors developed separate color categories for the film “La La Land” and incorporated machine learning algorithms. To achieve the said objective, structural analysis was conducted by employing the “five code network or topos” described in Roland Barthes’s book titled S/Z that was published in the year 1970 . The Barthesian code network was thereby applied to create input training data for machine learning algorithms.

Recently proposed adversarial examples-slightly modified data that lead to incorrect classification-are a severe threat to the security of DNNs. In some situations, however, an adversarial example might be useful, such as when deceiving an enemy classifier on the battlefield. In such a scenario, it is necessary that a friendly classifier not be deceived. In this paper, we propose a friend-safe adversarial example, meaning that the friendly machine can classify the adversarial example correctly. To produce such examples, a transformation is carried out to minimize the probability of incorrect classification by the friend and that of correct classification by the adversary. We suggest two configurations for the scheme: targeted and untargeted class attacks. We performed experiments with this scheme using the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

In order for ultra intelligent machines to be subjects of faith in the same conditions as humans, they must be able to have unique characteristics such as emotion, will, and self-consciousness. With the advent of ultra intelligent machines with the same level of cognitive and emotional abilities as human beings, the religious actions of artificial intelligence will be inevitable. The ultra intelligent machines after ‘singularity’ will go beyond the subject of religious belief and reign as God who can rule humans, nature and the world. This is also the common view of Morabeck, Kurzweil and Harari. Leonhart also reminds us that technological advances should make us used to the fact that we are now ‘gods’. But we fear we may face distopia despite the general affluence of the ‘Star Trec’ economy. For this reason, even if a man says he has learned the religious truth, one can’t help but wonder if it is true.Kant and Bloch are thinkers who critically reflected on our religious ideals and highest concept in different world-view premises. Kant’s concept of God as ‘idea of pure reason’ and ‘postulate of practical reason’, can seem like a ‘god of gap’ as Jesse Bering said earlier. Kant recognized the need for religious faith only on a strict basis of moral necessity. The subjects of religious faith should always strive to do the moral good, but such efforts themselves were not enough to reach perfection and so postulated immortality of the soul. But if an ultra intelligent machines that has emerged above a singularity is given a new status in an intellectual explosion, it can reach its morality by blocking evil tendencies and by the infinite evolution of super intelligence. So it will no longer need Kant’s ‘Postulate for continuous progress towards greater goodness’, ‘Postulate for divine grace’ and ‘Postulate for infinite expansion of the kingdom of God on earth.’ Artificial intelligence robots would not necessarily consider religious performance in the Kant’s meaning, and therefore religion will also have to be abolished.Ernst Bloch transforms Kant’s postulate to be Persian dualism. Therefore, in Bloch, even though the ultra intelligent machines is a divine being, one must critically ask whether it is a wicked or a good God. Artificial intelligence experts warn that ultra intellectual machine as Pandora’s gift will bring disaster to mankind. In the Kant’s Matrix, a ultra intelligent machines, which is the com- pletion of morality and God itself, may fall into a bad god in Bloch’s Matrix. Therefore, despite the myth of singularity, we still believe that ultra intelligent machines, whether as God leads us to the completion of one of our only religious beliefs, or as bad god to the collapse of mankind through complete denial of existence.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

The sensitivity and the prediction accuracy were evaluated with four models (i.e., Number of Hours of Relative Humidity (NHRH), Classification And Regression Tree/Stepwise Linear Discriminant (CART/SLD), Penman-Monteith (PM), Deep-learning Neural Network (DNN)). The sensitivity of models was evaluated with rainfall and seasonal changes. When the data in rainy days were excluded from the whole data set, the LWD models had smaller average error (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) about 1.5hours). The seasonal error of the DNN model had the similar magnitude (RMSE about 3 hours) among all seasons excluding winter. The other models had the greatest error in summer (RMSE about 9.6 hours) and the lowest error in winter (RMSE about 3.3 hours). These models were also evaluated by the statistical error analysis method and the regression analysis method of mean squared deviation. The DNN model had the best performance by statistical error whereas the CART/SLD model had the worst prediction accuracy. The Mean Square Deviation (MSD) is a method of analyzing the linearity of a model with three components: squared bias (SB), nonunity slope (NU), and lack of correlation (LC). Better model performance was determined by lower SB and LC and higher NU. The results of MSD analysis indicated that the DNN model would provide the best performance and followed by the PM, the NHRH and the CART/SLD in order. This result suggested that the machine learning model would be useful to improve the accuracy of agricultural information using meteorological data.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

In order to cope with that, many studies are being carried out to predict wind speed and power. The models used to predict wind energy are divided into three categories: Numerical Weather Prediction, statistical methods, and Artificial Intelligence methods.

An Efficient One Class Classifier Using Gaussian-based Hyper-Rectangle Generation,2018,"['Imbalanced Dataset', 'One-Class Classification', 'Classifier Using Hyper-Rectangle', 'Classification Rate', 'Interpretability']",,"In recent years, imbalanced data is one of the most important and frequent issue for quality control in industrial field. As an example, defect rate has been drastically reduced thanks to highly developed technology and quality management, so that only few defective data can be obtained from production process. Therefore, quality classification should be performed under the condition that one class (defective dataset) is even smaller than the other class (good dataset). However, traditional multi-class classification methods are not appropriate to deal with such an imbalanced dataset, since they classify data from the difference between one class and the others that can hardly be found in imbalanced datasets. Thus, one-class classification that thoroughly learns patterns of target class is more suitable for imbalanced dataset since it only focuses on data in a target class. So far, several one-class classification methods such as one-class support vector machine, neural network and decision tree there have been suggested. One-class support vector machine and neural network can guarantee good classification rate, and decision tree can provide a set of rules that can be clearly interpreted. However, the classifiers obtained from the former two methods consist of complex mathematical functions and cannot be easily understood by users. In case of decision tree, the criterion for rule generation is ambiguous. Therefore, as an alternative, a new one-class classifier using hyper-rectangles was proposed, which performs precise classification compared to other methods and generates rules clearly understood by users as well.

State Prediction of High-speed Ballistic Vehicles with Gaussian Process,2018,"['Aerodynamics', 'Gaussian process', 'high-speed vehicles', 'state prediction', 'target trajectory']",,"This paper proposes a new method of predicting the future state of a ballistic target trajectory. There have been a number of estimation methods that utilize the variations of Kalman filters, and the prediction of the future states followed the simple propagations of the target dynamic equations. However, these simple propagations suffered from no observation of the future state, so this propagation could not estimate a key parameter of the dynamics equation, such as the ballistic coefficient. We resolved this limitation by applying a data-driven approach to predict the ballistic coefficient. From this learning of the ballistic coefficient, we calculated the future state with the future ballistic parameter that differs over time. Our proposed model shows the better performance than the traditional simple propagation method in this state prediction task. The value of this research could be recognized as an application of machine learning techniques to the aerodynamics domains. Our framework suggests how to maximize the synergy by linking the traditional filtering aproaches and diverse machine learning techniques, i.e., Gaussian process regression, support vector regression and regularized linear regression.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

However, the size of the dataset provided by the DCASE Challenge is relatively small compared to ImageNet, which is a representative dataset for visual object recognition, and there are not many open sources for the acoustic dataset. In this study, the sound events that can occur in indoor and outdoor are collected on a larger scale and annotated for dataset construction. Furthermore, to improve the performance of the sound event detection task, we developed a dual CNN structured sound event detection system by adding a supplementary neural network to a convolutional neural network to determine the presence of sound events.

A new object for comparison emerged in the modern society, namely machinery represented as Artificial Intelligence. This new sort of being surprised the world with its unprecedented extraordinary competence in a few fields which have traditionally been dominated by human being. And now AI’s possibility and limit for or even against human being and human society are important issues in the knowledge society, especially in the era of the so called fourth industry revolution. In this background of techno-social and educational change, we trace back to the classical prototype of this idea called mechanistic anthropology by Rene Descartes. His finding or invention of cogito (the thinking ego) provides us with a clue to understand the theoretical process and result of the mechanization of or mechanistic understanding of human being as well as the history of oblivion of the corporality of human being. Based on this, we will try to rehabilitate the meaning of human corporality with the idea of Emmanuel Levinas who points out that human being consists not merely of his/her thinking function with his lightening reason, but also of his/her whole bodiness as a center of being as it cannot be fully explained with the cognitive-philosophical language by Descartes. In this connection, we also investigate the anthropological premise of the so called brain-based learning or brain-education, which, sharing the idea of Descartes, seems to be a educational version of the mechanized understanding of human being, in the hope of contributing to the contemporary science of education as a whole as well as to this new discipline of education.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

This is because the testimony of the testimony can be verified through the cross-examination. The reason for excluding evidence that cross-examination is not guaranteed is also due to reliability. Therefore, if the evidence is in an exceptional situation that guarantees credibility and is necessary, that evidence will be given even if there is no cross-examination. Confrontation right is a kind of right guaranteed by Article 6 of the US Constitution. When confrontation right is guaranteed, cross-examination are made. Confrontation right does not stop just facing the witness' face. During the face-to-face meeting, the testimony of the testimony is verified through a process in which the cross-examination are rigorously executed.The US Supreme Court has changed its attitude toward confrontation right from the crawford case in 2004 to not pay much attention to cross-examination. However, the confrontation right and the cross-examination are inseparable and in strong relationship, and even if we do not pay attention to the cross-examination itself, cross-examination right is guaranteed if the confrontation right is thoroughly guaranteed.However, the emergence of mechanical evidence, such as the evidence of artificial intelligence algorithms, has changed the evidence ecosystem to the point where it can not be protected by the confrontation right. Even if confrontation right guarantees or cross-examination guarantees are made, it is difficult to give credibility any longer.Much research has been done in the United States on whether mechanical evidence, such as artificial intelligence generated evidence, falls within the category of evidence of confrontation right. Especially from Crawford vs. California case, there have been various discussions as to whether mechanical evidence is subject to confrontation right. However, there is controversy as to whether this mechanical evidence is the evidence of confrontation right, and if the guarantee is not made, the evidence was not admissible. The reason is that there is a question whether mechanical evidence is a testimony, and whether it is possible to guarantee confrontation right against mechanical evidence. This is directly related to the fact that confrontation right or cross-examination guarantees the reliability of the evidence for mechanical evidence. Verification of the reliability of the evidence is not resolved by the frame of guaranteeing the existing the confrontation right or cross-examination. So a new type of verification method is needed. There is a need for a exclusive mechanism for systematic and reliable verification of reliability.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Dealing with Arabic ligature segmentation, where the Arabic characters are connected and unconstrained naturally, is one of the fundamental problems when dealing with the Arabic script. Arabic character‐recognition techniques consider ligatures as new classes in addition to the classes of the Arabic characters. This paper introduces an enhanced technique for Arabic handwriting recognition using the deep belief network (DBN) and a new morphological algorithm for ligature segmentation. There are two main stages for the implementation of this technique. The first stage involves an enhanced technique of the Sari segmentation algorithm, where a new ligature segmentation algorithm is developed.

Based on cumulative data, these corporations have highly sophisticated algorithms that can set prices of their goods and services.Due to the algorithms that can proceed data and conduct autonomous decision-making capability, it is crucial to collect data on consumers and competitors. Based on these algorithms, it is possible to monitor consumers and competitors, and to recognize changes of market situations in real time.On the one hand, algorithms bring positive effects in numerous cases. On the other hand, the prevalent use of algorithms can create a substantial risk in fair and efficient competition in the market. Recently, in this respect, the OECD and competition agencies of many jurisdictions have discussed the impact of algorithms’ automatic price setting on the competition in the market.Regarding the issue of algorithms’ automatic price-setting, an influential view is that the price-setting technology in itself does not constitute a violation of competition law. So far, a majority view seems to explain that consent among competing business entities is a required component for a violation of competition law. However, if computer algorithms become more developed and autonomous in the near future, a crucial question of competition law will lie concerning the meaning of consent among competing business entities. In this respect, it is a high time to consider whether core standards of the current competition law such as a business entity’s awareness should be maintained as the standards under the circumstances where technologies and machines are dominant in setting business strategies.Therefore, in carrying out competition policies, it is necessary for the judiciary and competition agencies in the government to consider and examine the interpretation of “consent” and “intent” in accordance with the current and future technology.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

However, conventional control chart schemes cannot necessarily accommodate all possible future conditions of a process because they are formulated based on information recorded in the early stages of the process. Several attempts have been made to accommodate process changes over time.

Therefore, it is difficult to apply the existing RF-based fingerprinting techniques to large-scale indoor environments such as airports and department stores. In this paper, instead of RF signal we use the geomagnetic sensor signal for indoor localization, whose signal strength is more stable than RF RSS. Although similar geomagnetic field values exist in indoor space, an object movement would experience a unique sequence of the geomagnetic field signals as the movement continues. We use a deep neural network model called the recurrent neural network (RNN), which is effective in recognizing time-varying sequences of sensor data, to track the user's location and movement path.

Scientific and technological advancements with big data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning are making easier the creation of profiles and the consequent decision-making. However, the rights and freedoms of individuals, here data subjects for data protection purposes, would be negatively affected by those advancements. It must be a serious matter that individuals would not easily find the fact of processing of their personal data in this context and how the processing goes. They are likely to be subject to risks of unreasonable social segregation or discrimination from a certain way of classification. The assessments through profiling may not always be correct, and in this case the rights and freedoms of those individuals may be further breached unjustifiably.The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union, to be applicable on 25 May 2018, provides for profiling explicitly. It provides for specific provisions that individuals are not to suffer from decisions solely based on automated processing including profiling. As to the provisions on automated decision-making, while GDPR is roughly similar to 1995 Directive, it has the following important changes. First, the concept of profiling is introduced. Second, the explicit consent of data subjects is a new lawful basis allowing decisions solely based on automated processing including profiling. Third, those decisions above are exceptionally allowed even for special categories of personal data. Fourth, controllers are obligatory to provide the information on profiling to data subjects. Fifth, binding corporate rules must contain the right of data subjects not to be subject to those decisions above.Korean laws on data protection have certain provisions relating to profiling, although they are not directly dealing with it. As the ways to take advantage of the fourth industrial revolution are seriously explored these days, it is a right time to provide the specific rules on profiling in those laws on data protection. There must be a right balance in data protection between data subjects and data processors in Korean terminologies.

Causal Inference Network of Genes Related with Bone Metastasis of Breast Cancer and Osteoblasts Using Causal Bayesian Networks,2018,"['Bayes theorem', 'Breast neoplasms', 'Neoplasm metastasis', 'Osteoblasts']",,"Background: The causal networks among genes that are commonly expressed in osteoblasts and during bone metastasis (BM) of breast cancer (BC) are not well understood. Here, we developed a machine learning method to obtain a plausible causal network of genes that are commonly expressed during BM and in osteoblasts in BC. Methods: We selected BC genes that are commonly expressed during BM and in osteoblasts from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Bayesian Network Inference with Java Objects (Banjo) was used to obtain the Bayesian network. Genes registered as BC related genes were included as candidate genes in the implementation of Banjo. Next, we obtained the Bayesian structure and assessed the prediction rate for BM, conditional independence among nodes, and causality among nodes. Furthermore, we reported the maximum relative risks (RRs) of combined gene expression of the genes in the model. Results: We mechanistically identified 33 significantly related and plausibly involved genes in the development of BC BM. Further model evaluations showed that 16 genes were enough for a model to be statistically significant in terms of maximum likelihood of the causal Bayesian networks (CBNs) and for correct prediction of BM of BC. Maximum RRs of combined gene expression patterns showed that the expression levels of UBIAD1, HEBP1, BTNL8, TSPO, PSAT1, and ZFP36L2 significantly affected development of BM from BC.

Industrial Internet of Things Based Efficient and Reliable Data Dissemination Solution for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks,2018,,,"<P>Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the other name of industrial Internet. It integrates a variety of existing industrial automation technologies with computing, machine learning, and communication technologies. Vehicular ad hoc network, an application of IIoT, is a self-organized network of vehicles which tends to provide improved road safety, diminished traffic congestion, and ultimate comfort to the travellers. In VANETs, vehicles exchange data with each other directly or through roadside units (RSUs). Data dissemination in VANETs experiences numerous challenging issues including broadcast storm, network partitions, intermittent connectivity between vehicles, and limited bandwidth. In literature, various data dissemination schemes are proposed. However, most of these schemes are designed for either urban or highway VANET scenarios and evaluated under sparse or dense traffic conditions. Moreover, these schemes do not effectively overcome the aforementioned issues simultaneously. In this paper, we present a new data dissemination protocol for VANETs, which disseminates the emergency messages in different scenarios under varying traffic conditions. During dense traffic conditions, DDP4V employs the segmentation of transmission region of a vehicle in order to select the most appropriate next forwarding vehicle (NFV). Accordingly, it divides the transmission region of a vehicle in three distinct segments and selects vehicle(s) inside the highest priority segment to forward the message to all neighbour vehicles, whereas it also uses implicit acknowledgements for guaranteed message delivery during sparse traffic Conditions. Simulation results show that DDP4V protocol outperforms the other existing related protocols in terms of coverage, network overhead, collision, and end-to-end delay.</P>",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which is important issue in video surveillance research, is a field to detect abnormal behavior of pedestrians in CCTV environment. In order to recognize human behavior, it is necessary to detect the human in the image and to estimate the pose from the detected human. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for 2D Human Pose Estimation based on object detection using RGB-D information. By adding depth information to the RGB information that has some limitation in detecting object due to lack of topological information, we can improve the detecting accuracy. Subsequently, the rescaled region of the detected object is applied to ConVol.utional Pose Machines (CPM) which is a sequential prediction structure based on ConVol.utional Neural Network. We utilize CPM to generate belief maps to predict the positions of keypoint representing human body parts and to estimate human pose by detecting 14 key body points. From the experimental results, we can prove that the proposed method detects target objects robustly in occlusion. It is also possible to perform 2D human pose estimation by providing an accurately detected region as an input of the CPM. As for the future work, we will estimate the 3D human pose by mapping the 2D coordinate information on the body part onto the 3D space.

Since optimizing performance of the applications at distributed environment is challenging because it not only needs optimizing the applications themselves but also requires tuning of the distributed system configuration parameters. Although prior researches made a huge effort to improve execution performance, most of them only focused on one of three performance optimization aspect: application design, system tuning, hardware utilization. Thus, they couldn’t handle an orchestration of those aspects. In this paper, we deeply analyze and model the application processing procedure of the Spark.

The main character, Cinder, is a cyborg and this fact itself prepares readers to read Cinder as Donna Haraway’s cyborg: a metaphor to express a possibility of blurring boundaries, learning how not to be the human defined by liberal humanism, and accepting a self as fluid, flexible, and repeatedly dissembled and reassembled in relationality with non-humans. But Cinder, in the first part of the story, reveals unconscious adherence to the concept of a whole, intrinsic self by repeatedly mentioning “metal invaders”. She wants to establish her self by building a boundary along the line where her human body and artificial parts meld together. This attitude makes Cinder view her cyborg body less than human and want to hide metallic parts. It also justifies the practice of cyborg draft under an excuse of finding a cure for the epidemic, letumosis. Toward the end of the story, however, in the crisis of facing Levana, the Lunar Queen, Cinder perceives her opponent through the eyes of a camera, a human being and a Lunar. She cannot identify who or what is seeing Levana. Cinder circumvents Levana’s power by being her, that is a part human, a part machine, a part Lunar, and at the same time, that is not a machine, not a human, nor a Lunar.

Accurate and Efficient Log Template Discovery Technique,2018,"['Log template', 'Log analysis', 'Log parsing']",,"In this paper we propose a novel log template discovery algorithm which achieves high quality of discovered log templates through iterative log filtering technique. Log templates are the static string pattern of logs that are used to produce actual logs by inserting variable values during runtime. Identifying individual logs into their template category correctly enables us to conduct automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Our technique looks at the group of logs column-wise and filters the logs that have the value of the highest proportion. We repeat this process per each column until we are left with highly homogeneous set of logs that most likely belong to the same log template category. Then, we determine which column is the static part and which is the variable part by vertically comparing all the logs in the group. This process repeats until we have discovered all the templates from given logs. Also, during this process we discover the custom patterns such as ID formats that are unique to the application. This information helps us quickly identify such strings in the logs as variable parts thereby further increasing the accuracy of the discovered log templates. Existing solutions suffer from log templates being too general or too specific because of the inability to detect custom patterns. Through extensive evaluations we have learned that our proposed method achieves 2 to 20 times better accuracy.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

It is performed by fraudulently deceiving users with the aim of obtaining their sensitive information such as bank account information, credit card, username, and password. The threat has led to huge losses to online retailers, e-business platform, financial institutions, and to name but a few. One way to build anti-phishing detection mechanism is to construct classification algorithm based on machine learning techniques. The objective of this paper is to compare different classifier ensemble approaches, i.e. random forest, rotation forest, gradient boosted machine, and extreme gradient boosting against single classifiers, i.e. decision tree, classification and regression tree, and credal decision tree in the case of website phishing. Area under ROC curve (AUC) is employed as a performance metric, whilst statistical tests are used as baseline indicator of significance evaluation among classifiers. The paper contributes the existing literature on making a benchmark of classifier ensembles for web phishing detection.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

There were several issues in this trend, the ability of deep learning by machine, the identity of the human, the change of job environment and the concern about the social change etc.Recently many studies have been made about the 4th industrial revolution in many fields like as AI(artificial intelligence), CRISPR, big data and driverless car etc. As many positive effects and pessimistic effects are existed at the same time and many preventing actions are being suggested recently, these opinions will be compared and analyzed and better solutions will be found eventually. Several educational, political, scientific, social and ethical effects and solutions were studied and suggested in this study. Clear implication from the study is that the world we will live from now on is changing faster than ever in the social, industrial, political and educational environment.If it will reform the social systems according to those changes, a society (nation or government) will grasp the chance of its development or take-off, otherwise, it will consume the resources ineffectively and lose the competition as a whole society. But the method of that reform is not that apparent in many aspects as the revolution is progressing currently and its definition should be made whether in industrial or scientific aspect.

To that end, we first identify five specific industry sectors which are expected to grow rapidly with the 4th industrial revolution-namely, transportation and logistics, telecommunications, finance and insurance, education services, and health and social services- and examine characteristics of these industries along with specific examples to derive plans for job creation and job security. New jobs will be created around the technologies which have led the 4th revolution such as Block Chain, Big Data, Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented/Virtual Reality. The government needs to equip its workforce with these technologies in order to cope with the changing demand actively.

While most modern control strategies are based on process models, many existing models of MCFC are not ready to be applied in synthesis and operation of control systems. In this study, we developed an auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) model and machine learning methods of least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and partial least squares (PLS) for the MCFC system based on input-output operating data. The ARMA model showed the best tracking performance. A model predictive control method for the operation of MCFC system was developed based on the proposed ARMA model. The control performance of the proposed MPC methods was compared with that of conventional controllers using numerical simulations performed on various process models including an MCFC process.

However, in the traditional view, ‘act’ presupposes the agent 's free will, and even if it is man's act, the act is denied if the agent 's free will is denied. The most important and dominant source of artificial intelligence is the production and installation of artificial intelligence algorithms, and the operation of artificial intelligence is subject to algorithms. Also, artificial intelligence is evolving gradually through machine learning, and artificial intelligence can not be reduced to human act of artificial intelligence algorithm creation and installation. Furthermore, AI users do not have specific control over the operation of artificial intelligence. An artificial intelligence user does not know at all how to pay attention to the operation of artificial intelligence will not cause harm to others. Therefore, it is difficult to recognize the conduct of the omission of the obligation to pay attention to the occupier who is not able to control the artificial intelligence. This attempt to reduce the result of artificial intelligence to traditional human behavior is hard to obtain logical persuasion. As a result, even if the illegal act caused by the operation of artificial intelligence does not occur due to intentional or negligent reason, it is necessary to reconstruct the principle for liability to the person who has a certain normative relationship with artificial intelligence.This Study examines the principle of liability based on fault liability and then examines the civil liability of artificial intelligence centered on liability for mitigating behavior and non.

Three types of road sections were considered, namely, basic, tunnel, and soundproof tunnel.METHODS: A thermal mapping system was employed to collect actual road surface temperature and locational data of the survey vehicle. Data collection was conducted 12 times from 05:30 am to 06:30 am on the test route, which is an uninterrupted flow facility. A total of 9010 road surface temperature data were collected, and half of these were selected based on a random selection process. The other half was used to evaluate the performance of the model. The model used herein is based on machine learning algorithms. The mean absolute error (MAE) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation performance of the model.RESULTS: The MAE was calculated to determine the difference between the estimated and the actual road surface temperature. A MAE of 0.48℃ was generated for the overall test route. The basic section obtained the smallest error whereas that of the tunnel was relatively high.CONCLUSIONS: The road surface temperature change is closely related to the air temperature. The process of data pre-processing is very important to improve the estimation accuracy of the model. Lastly, it was difficult to determine the influence of the data collection date on the estimation of the road surface temperature change pattern due to the same weather conditions.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

The classification of information or documents has been largely based on machine learning, but there is not enough training data categorized on the basis of KSIC. Therefore, this study applied the method of calculating similarity between documents. Specifically, a method and a model for presenting the most appropriate KSIC code are proposed by collecting explanatory texts of each code of KSIC and calculating the similarity with the classification object document using the vector space model. The IPC data were collected and classified by KSIC. And then verified the methodology by comparing it with the KSIC-IPC concordance table provided by the Korean Intellectual Property Office. As a result of the verification, the highest agreement was obtained when the LT method, which is a kind of TF-IDF calculation formula, was applied. At this time, the degree of match of the first rank matching KSIC was 53% and the cumulative match of the fifth ranking was 76%. Through this, it can be confirmed that KSIC classification of technology, industry, and market information that SMEs need more quantitatively and objectively is possible.

This paper, far from adding comments to the debates on the massive technological unemployment, pays attention to how AI plays out in working practice of large digital corporations and what missions human workers carry out along with AI. Rather than pitting AI against humans, I explore how AI and humans are intertwined in work settings and how ‘humanness’ and ‘machineness’ are negotiated and constructed in this process.

Design of Reinforced Interval Type-2 Fuzzy C-Means-Based Fuzzy Classifier,2018,,,"<P>This paper is concerned with a new design methodology of a reinforced interval type-2 fuzzy c-means (FCM) based fuzzy classifier (FC). The key point of this study is to reduce the computational complexity of type-2 fuzzy set-based models and to alleviate the deterioration of its generalization abilities through the synergistic effect of two algorithms: First, interval type-2 FCM (IT2FCM) is used in the hidden layer of the network and connections (weights) are adjusted by invoking the least squares error estimation method. Second, an L<SUB>2</SUB>-norm regularization is considered in the cost function to avoid the construction of the network suffering from overfitting. In more detail, the hidden layer of the proposed FC is realized by interval type-2 FCM clustering to deal with the factor of uncertainty involved in the problem. This type of clustering is realized by using two values of the fuzzification coefficient resulting in the interval type-2 membership functions. Once completing type reduction, the membership grades of IT2FCM are used as the outputs of the hidden layer. Instead of the backpropagation training, least squares estimator based learning is applied to adjust the functional connection being regarded as linear functions mapping the hidden layer to the output layer. In order to reduce potential overfitting, L<SUB>2</SUB>-norm regularization is taken into account. The effectiveness of the proposed classifier is analyzed with the aid of a number of machine learning datasets as well as face image datasets. Thorough comparative studies are also included.</P>",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Methods: We reviewed research articles published within the last decade that used digital data to answer epidemiological research questions. Data were abstracted from these articles using a data collection tool that we developed. Finally, we summarized the characteristics of the digital epidemiological studies. Results: We identified six main topic domains: infectious diseases (58.7%), non-communicable diseases (29.4%), mental health and substance use (8.3%), general population behavior (4.6%), environmental, dietary, and lifestyle (4.6%), and vital status (0.9%). We identified four categories for the study purpose: description (22.9%), exploration (34.9%), explanation (27.5%), and prediction and control (14.7%). We identified eight categories for the data sources: web search query (52.3%), social media posts (31.2%), web portal posts (11.9%), webpage access logs (7.3%), images (7.3%), mobile phone network data (1.8%), global positioning system data (1.8%), and others (2.8%).

A study on Classification of Insider threat using Markov Chain Model,2018,"['Insider threat', 'Markov Chain', 'Classification']",,"In this paper, a method to classify insider threat activity is introduced. The internal threats help detecting anomalous activity in the procedure performed by the user in an organization. When an anomalous value deviating from the overall behavior is displayed, we consider it as an inside threat for classification as an inside intimidator. To solve the situation, Markov Chain Model is employed. The Markov Chain Model shows the next state value through an arbitrary variable affected by the previous event. Similarly, the current activity can also be predicted based on the previous activity for the insider threat activity. A method was studied where the change items for such state are defined by a transition probability, and classified as detection of anomaly of the inside threat through values for a probability variable. We use the properties of the Markov chains to list the behavior of the user over time and to classify which state they belong to. Sequential data sets were generated according to the influence of n occurrences of Markov attribute and classified by machine learning algorithm.

Gaussian Process Regression and Classification for Probabilistic Damage Assessment of Spatially Distributed Systems,2018,"['binary components', 'gaussian process classification', 'probabilistic inference', 'spatially distributed systems']",,"We illustrate how methods for non-parametric regression and classification based on Gaussian Processes can be adapted for inferring the condition state of infrastructure components under spatially distributed stressors. When the stressor is modeled by a random field, observations collected in one location can reduce the uncertainty about the stressor intensity also in other locations.Exact inference is possible when the field is Gaussian and observations are perfect or affected by Gaussian noise. However, often the available observations are binary, as those related to the failure or survival of components, and indicate whether the local field is above or below a threshold whose value may also be uncertain. While no efficient scheme for exact inference is available in that setting, we can perform efficient approximate inference when the field is Gaussian and so is the uncertainty on the threshold value.The mathematical formulation for this problem is analogous to that of classification in machine learning, that can be based on latent Gaussian processes. We show how to formulate the problem and how to adapt deterministic methods, as Laplace’s method and Expectation Propagation, and methods based on random number generation, as Monte Carlo uniform sampling and importance sampling, to perform approximate inference. Our illustrative application is the condition assessment of assets exposed to a seismic event. Under specific assumptions, the seismic demand can be modeled as a Gaussian random field, and measures about the demand and about the survival and failure of assets can be processed globally, to update the risk assessment. Specifically, we evaluate methods for approximate inference and discuss their merits.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

Evaluation of summer passive microwave sea ice concentrations in the Chukchi Sea based on KOMPSAT-5 SAR and numerical weather prediction data,2018,"['Sea ice concentration', 'Sea ice algorithm', 'Passive microwave sensor', 'KOMPSAT-5', 'Synthetic aperture radar', 'Numerical weather prediction', 'Chukchi Sea']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Satellite passive microwave (PM) sensors have observed sea ice in Polar Regions and provided sea ice concentration (SIC) data since the 1970s. SIC has been used as a primary data source for climate change prediction and ship navigation. However, the accuracy of PM SIC is typically low and biased in summer. To provide more accurate information for climatic research and ship navigation, it is necessary to evaluate quantitatively the accuracy of PM SIC and to account for its errors. In this research, we evaluated the SIC data derived from PM measurements using four representative sea ice algorithms: NASA Team (NT), Bootstrap (BT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) hybrid, and Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction STudy (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI). Analyses were performed for the Chukchi Sea in summer using KOrean Multi-Purpose SATellite-5 (KOMPSAT-5) Enhanced Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Ice/water maps were generated by binary classification of texture features in the SAR images based on Random Forest, a rule-based machine learning approach. SIC values estimated from the sea ice algorithms showed good correlation with those calculated from the KOMPSAT-5 ice/water maps, but the root mean square error was larger than 10%. SIC values estimated from the algorithms showed different error trends according to the KOMPSAT-5 SIC range. All algorithms overestimated SIC values in open drift ice zones (KOMPSAT-5 SICs ranged from 0% to 15%). In marginal ice zones (SICs ranged from 15% to 80%), the OSISAF SIC values were the least biased compared to those from KOMPSAT-5. The NT algorithm largely underestimated SIC values in marginal ice zones, while the BT and ASI algorithms overestimated them considerably. All algorithms, except for BT, underestimated SIC in consolidated pack ice zones (SICs ranged from 80% to 100%). By analyzing the correlations of biases of SIC from the algorithms with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the European Reanalysis Agency Interim reanalysis, it was found that the overestimation of NT and ASI SICs was largely influenced by atmospheric water vapor content, while the underestimation of NT and OSISAF SICs was owing to ice surface melting. The overestimation of BT SICs was not significantly correlated with the NWP data.

At first it was not properly appreciated by mainstream academia, but it began to draw public attention largely due to the rise of digital humanities discourse along with the rapid progress of digital technology at the turn of the century. English studies was one of the major disciplines that actively adopted digital humanistic methodology and applied it to research and education. Digital literary scholars have shed light on previously unknown aspects of English literature by combining text analysis and “distant reading” and by statistically analyzing large-scale corpora of literary works. They take advantage of such sophisticated methods as metadata analysis, social network analysis and visualization, topic modeling, machine learning, and geographic information system as well as traditional text analysis techniques. In contrast, Korean academics of English literature are completely indifferent to digital literary studies. Ignoring any new methodology to study literature cannot be justified at all. Someone should try it, and we should debate about its value and validity. This will surely enrich Korean academia. This paper examines major research achievements of American digital literary studies from the early years of humanities computing to the present, thus laying the groundwork for discussion on digital humanistic approaches to English literature in Korea.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

The 8 years NIER indices with the water quality (T-N, NH4, NO3, T-P, PO4) showed that the deviation of AHI score is large when the concentration of water quality is low, and AHI score had negative correlation when the concentration is high. By using random forest, one of the Machine Learning techniques for classification analysis, the classification results for the 3 indices grade showed that all of precision, recall, and f1-score were above 0.81. The future SWAT hydrology and water quality results under HadGEM3-RA RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios of Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) showed that the future nitrogen-related water quality in watershed average increased up to 43.2% by the baseflow increase effect and the phosphorus-related water quality decreased up to 18.9% by the surface runoff decrease effect.

In this study for the first time, all effective predictors in Satellite Convection Analysis and Tracking version 2 (SATCASTv2) and NWP were applied over Iran from22ndMarch 2015 to 9th January 2016. In applying SATCASTv2 over Iran, it was necessary to make some modifications to the algorithm, such as removing case specific thresholds of satellite predictors and rearranging COIN predictors. Then, SATCASTv2 was tested and evaluated with both the full and reduced set of predictors. The results suggested that using fixed thresholds for temporal difference predictors could miss COIN in some cases. To investigate the possibility of improving computational efficiency, a dimension reduction was conducted by Factor Analysis (FA) and the number of predictors was reduced from 22 to 11. TheNWP-satellite, reduced NWP-satellite, and satellite predictors were used as input in Random Forest (RF), as a parametric machine learning method, for COIN evaluation.The Combination ofNWP model and satellite predictors had lower false alarm rates in contrast with satellite predictors. This is in agreement with previous studies. The results from statistical metrics showed that the reduced NWP-satellite predictors had comparable performance to the NWP-satellite predictors over study area, but decreased the run time by almost 50%.

Design of Query Processing System to Retrieve Information from Social Network using NLP,2018,"['Query Processing', 'Social Network', 'LDA', 'Natural Language Processing']",,"Social Network Aggregators are used to maintain and manage manifold accounts over multiple online social networks. Displaying the Activity feed for each social network on a common dashboard has been the status quo of social aggregators for long, however retrieving the desired data from various social networks is a major concern. A user inputs the query desiring the specific outcome from the social networks. Since the intention of the query is solely known by user, therefore the output of the query may not be as per user’s expectation unless the system considers ‘user-centric’ factors. Moreover, the quality of solution depends on these user-centric factors, the user inclination and the nature of the network as well. Thus, there is a need for a system that understands the user’s intent serving structured objects. Further, choosing the best execution and optimal ranking functions is also a high priority concern. The current work finds motivation from the above requirements and thus proposes the design of a query processing system to retrieve information from social network that extracts user’s intent from various social networks. For further improvements in the research the machine learning techniques are incorporated such as Latent Dirichlet Algorithm (LDA) and Ranking Algorithm to improve the query results and fetch the information using data mining techniques.The proposed framework uniquely contributes a user-centric query retrieval model based on natural language and it is worth mentioning that the proposed framework is efficient when compared on temporal metrics.

Understanding Neurogastroenterology From Neuroimaging Perspective: A Comprehensive Review of Functional and Structural Brain Imaging in Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders,2018,"['Dyspepsia', 'Homeostasis', 'Irritable bowel syndrome', 'Neuroimaging', 'Visceral pain']",,"This review provides a comprehensive overview of brain imaging studies of the brain-gut interaction in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Functional neuroimaging studies during gut stimulation have shown enhanced brain responses in regions related to sensory processing of the homeostatic condition of the gut (homeostatic afferent) and responses to salience stimuli (salience network), as well as increased and decreased brain activity in the emotional response areas and reduced activation in areas associated with the top-down modulation of visceral afferent signals. Altered central regulation of the endocrine and autonomic nervous responses, the key mediators of the brain-gut axis, has been demonstrated. Studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging reported abnormal local and global connectivity in the areas related to pain processing and the default mode network (a physiological baseline of brain activity at rest associated with self-awareness and memory) in FGIDs. Structural imaging with brain morphometry and diffusion imaging demonstrated altered gray- and white-matter structures in areas that also showed changes in functional imaging studies, although this requires replication. Molecular imaging by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography in FGIDs remains relatively sparse. Progress using analytical methods such as machine learning algorithms may shift neuroimaging studies from brain mapping to predicting clinical outcomes. Because several factors contribute to the pathophysiology of FGIDs and because its population is quite heterogeneous, a new model is needed in future studies to assess the importance of the factors and brain functions that are responsible for an optimal homeostatic state.(J Neurogastroenterol Motil 2018;24:512-527)",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

In this study, we classified neutral and negative emotions(sadness, fear, surprise) using arousal evaluation, which is one of the psychological evaluation scales, as well as physiological signals. We have not only revealed the difference between physiological signals coupled to the emotions, but also assessed how accurate these emotions can be classified by our emotional recognizer based on neural network algorithm. A total of 146 participants(mean age 20.1 ± 4.0, male 41%) were emotionally stimulated while their physiological signals of the electrocardiogram, blood flow, and dermal activity were recorded. In addition, the participants evaluated their psychological states on the emotional rating scale in response to the emotional stimuli.Heart rate(HR), standard deviation(SDNN), blood flow(BVP), pulse wave transmission time(PTT), skin conduction level(SCL) and skin conduction response(SCR) were calculated before and after the emotional stimulation. As a result, the difference between physiological responses was verified corresponding to the emotions, and the highest emotion classification performance of 86.9% was obtained using the combined analysis of arousal and physiological features.

Because the party intends to control people more authoritatively through the ‘incorporation of politics into life’ and the people on the other hand wish to find the opportunity to resist in living through the ‘incorporation of living into politics’ and broaden the opportunity. This study used the ‘conflict between living and politics’ as the framework of analysis to investigate the trend of changes in history with respect to the ‘work on socialist reality theme’ of North Korea. The first phase (1965∼1978) is when the party displayed political ‘leadership’ in order to change people daily life in a constructive way. They embodied the images of the daily life where all people enjoy the benefit of education, men and women are equally participating in the social activities, farmers are learning new technologies to operate agricultural machine, workers are attending colleges at work to learn about new technologies and theories in comparison with the past. The political leadership was justified by raising aspiration and expectation for an equal society. The second phase (1978∼ 1985) is when the party showed political ‘tolerance’ so that the juche ideology could smoothly take root in the daily life of the people. The special ties between the chairman, party, and people was given prominence by concretely embodying the private experiences that the people enjoy in living and emphasizing that it requires the protection from the chairman and the party as the premise. Giving autonomy to the daily life of people also brought the illusion of political tolerance. The third phase (1985∼1995) is when the party revealed the political ‘conversion’ in order to catch up with the daily life of the people. The images of deviant people, exemplary people, or people with different values in everyday life are put together toward each other through conversation. A new attempt of political conversion has been made to delay the change by awakening them to realize individual deviation or urging them to reflect on augmented desire. The changes in the life of North Korean people will accelerate due to the innate repetitiveness in living, and thereby broadening the gap between the target culture of North Korea and realistic culture. Also, it is still uncertain whether the Korean Workers’ Party would choose the path to change its system by resetting the target culture, ‘Construction of Socialist and Communist Society’ or choose the path to maintain its system by broadening the pace of forward-looking politics which systematically accept the realistic culture saturated with capitalism. However, one thing that can be confirmed once again by examining the trend of changes in history with respect to the ‘work on socialist reality theme’ of North Korea centering on the ‘issue of conflict between living and politics’ is that the force that drives the development of the system, regardless of the type of the social system, is the ‘openness’ of the system.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

At that time some articles and travel writings which intended to introduce Japan’s Westernization to English readers increased. Most British writers were positive about Japan’s reform, and expressed surprise at the result. In particular, they highly appreciated the decision of the Japanese ruling class to yield their existing power interest for reform. Considering the process of the reform, British intellectuals pointed out diligence and national education as ‘the Japanese’. And the new government tried to establish higher education institutes and to introduce learn European culture and civilization.  But behind this positive assessment were there Anglo-centric views. For example, their emphasis on the Japanese’ diligence is related to the spread of machines in British society since industrialization. In particular, they did not predict that Japan would surpass Europe even if it developed. But only 30 years after the Meiji restoration, Japan succeeded in making a powerful nation-state that could compete with European powers.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv
Efficient Data Clustering using Fast Choice for Number of Clusters,2018,"['Data Clustering', 'Heuristic Algorithm', 'Number of Clusters', 'Silhouette']",,"K-means algorithm is one of the most popular and widely used clustering method because it is easy to implement and very efficient. However, this method has the limitation to be used with fixed number of clusters because of only considering the intra-cluster distance to evaluate the data clustering solutions. Silhouette is useful and stable valid index to decide the data clustering solution with number of clusters to consider the intra and inter cluster distance for unsupervised data. However, this valid index has high computational burden because of considering quality measure for each data object. The objective of this paper is to propose the fast and simple speed-up method to overcome this limitation to use silhouette for the effective large-scale data clustering.In the first step, the proposed method calculates and saves the distance for each data once. In the second step, this distance matrix is used to calculate the relative distance rate (Vj) of each data j and this rate is used to choose the suitable number of clusters without much computation time. In the third step, the proposed efficient heuristic algorithm (Group search optimization, GSO, in this paper) can search the global optimum with saving computational capacity with good initial solutions using  probabilisticallyfor the data clustering. The performance of our proposed method is validated to save significantly computation timeagainst the original silhouette only using Ruspini, Iris, Wine and Breast cancer in UCI machine learning repository datasets by experiment and analysis.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution will bring about a massive transformation of the civilization itself, as well as corporations and the nation. Literature can not escape from this flow. The human mind, genes, and neurons are connected in the relationship of dependant origination with each other. Although the human mind is generated from genes and neurons, networking of the whole body also affects genes and neurons. Therefore, human beings have free will. Artificial intelligence will not replace humans perfectly, but strong AI Robot will break through technological singularity around 2050, making intelligent explosions and learning super-intelligence. AI will not only replace humans in many fields, but also confuse human nature and identity. In this case, the four beings of human, machine, AI, and cyborg will form a relationship of conflict and contradiction. In literature, tools and creators’ positions are overturned, and humans will fall into slavery or agents as the initial input ends. Literature must pursue human nature, life, and spirituality, which are distinct from AI. To achieve this, writing and reading should be done to create difference. We are experiencing more and more tele-presence because of the improved virtual reality. This breaks the boundaries between virtual and real and the crisis of representation increases. In the future, virtual reality will transcend the reality of literature. Nevertheless, the realm of literary reality will remain. The alternative of these matters is the “realism of teum(the gap) and cham(the ultimate truth)” that constantly makes a gap and pursues the truth while vibrating between the virtual and the reality. Now the world is transforming into a super-connected society that is connected to each other through the internet as if almost all objects, spaces, and data have intelligence. The hyper-linked society through the internet of things will increase the scope of a shared society with zero marginal cost, which will work in the field of literature as well. In a hyper-linked society, writers will give secondary meaning to objects that have their own meaning in the network, not objects that exist alone. Its aim is to make a nodal and feminine writing.

For the purpose of this study, 238 new words, which are connected to proper nouns and have been created within the last 5 years, have been collected from news articles in order to analyze their morphological and semantic characteristics. The way of coining this type of new words does not differ greatly from the coinage of general words. The analysis of lexical constituents shows that there are around three times more neologisms wherein the proper noun precedes the other constituent than neologisms wherein the proper noun comes afterwards. 123 new words that could be semantically regarded as proper nouns have been founded, among which, however, coinages composed of solely common nouns are in fact more frequent than those including proper nouns. It can be observed that many of the neologisms studied in this study tend to capture the momentary nature of a contextual situation. Such a tendency seems to reflect changes in the way today’s creators of neologisms communicate. Previous literature on neologisms shows that researchers have mainly been focusing on new words as candidates for dictionary inclusion; therefore, little attention was given to proper-noun-related neologisms. This paper seeks to fill the lacunae in neologism studies as well as to develop a methodology of new word extraction.

Dreyfus)의 비판적 성찰의 핵심 요소들을 부분적으로 간략하게 살펴보고, 그가 수행한 작업이 오늘날의 인공지능 연구자들에게 어떤 인간학적인 함의를 전해줄 수 있을지를 철학사적 관점에서 보충적으로 성찰하고 짚어보는 데 주된 목표를 설정한다. 본 연구의 핵심적인 물음은 다음과 같다. “오늘날까지 사이버네틱스 연구자들을 지배하는 존재론적 가정의 철학사적 기원은 무엇인가? 인간의 의식에 대한 이들의 가정은 인공지능 시대의 도래를 맞이하는 오늘날 어떤 양태의 근원적 문제들을 유발하는가?” 이 물음에 답하기 위해, 본 연구는 우선 사이버네틱스의 역사, 그리고 그 과정에서 드러난 사이버네틱스의 기본이념에 대한 드레이퍼스의 비판적 성찰을 간략히 고찰한다. 여기서는 인간 의식과 인공지능 간의 근원적 차이, 그리고 초기 사이버네틱스 연구자들 사이에 공유되던 존재론적 가정의 진면목과 문제점에 대한 드레이퍼스의 견해를 살피는 데 초점을 맞춘다. 다음으로 본 연구는 이런 존재론적 가정에 대해 그가 수행하지 못한 철학사적 분석을 추가로 진행함으로써 그의 사이버네틱스 성찰이 가진 함의를 오늘날의 인공지능 개발 현실에 발맞춰 길어내는 데 주력한다. 무엇보다 인공신경망 기반 기계학습 인공지능이 각광받는 오늘의 현실에서도 드레이퍼스의 현상학적 성찰이 유의미하게 받아들여질 수 있을지를 살피는 데 논의의 초점을 맞춘다.","The present study is aimed at examining core factors in Hubert L. Dreyfus` critical reflections on the basic ideology of early cybernetics, an investigation followed by an additional reflection on some anthropological implications of his critique for today`s artificial intelligence researchers. The present study raises the following questions: ""What is the philosophical origin of the ontological assumption which has dominated contemporary cybernetics researchers? What types of fundamental problems has this assumption on human consciousness caused by now?"" To answer these questions, this study first undertakes the task of looking over the history of cybernetics and its basic ideology, which has been subject to Dreyfus"" reflective criticism. The first part of this study concentrates on his observations on fundamental differences between human consciousness and artificial intelligence and his views on the real nature and problems of ontological assumption, which were widely shared by early cybernetics researchers. Afterwards, the present study proceeds to an additional philosophical-historical analysis of cybernetics` ontological assumption in such a way that this study can shed some light on the implications of Dreyfus` reflections on cybernetics. The focus of the later part of this study is on the existential validity of his phenomenological reflections in today`s reality in which an interest in machine learning, which is based on artificial neural networks, prevails among cybernetics researchers and the public.",machine_learning_2018_academic_riss.csv

XGBoost의 XGBoost Feature Importance 모듈과 XGBoostExplainer 패키지를 용하여 인지능력 개선, 악 화 요인을 탐색했다. 연구 결과 인지능력 개선⋅악화를 가르는 주요인은 도구 일상생활 수행 능력(IADL), 우울 감, 소득, 친한 사람과의 교류다. 우울감이 악화될 때, 우울감이 인지능력 악화 요인으로 강하게 작용하는 것으로 나타났다. 하지만 우울감 개선에 비례하여 우울감이 인지능력의 개선 요인으로 작용하는 계는 약하게 나타났다.","The purpose of this study is to build an elderly cognitive change predictive model and, as a result, to identify potential factors which lead to cognition improvement or deterioration using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) conducted biennially from 2008 to 2016 was used as a dataset. Particularly, the XGBoost Feature Importance module and XGBoost Explainer package were used to explain elderly cognitive changes. The main findings of this study indicate that instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), depression, income, and interactions with close friends are potential improvement and/or deteriorating factors. Furthermore, when the depression level is exacerbated, depression was found to strongly influence as a factor of cognitive deterioration. However, in proportion to the improvement of depression, the relationship between depression and cognitive abilities is seemingly weak.",xgboost_2018_academic_riss.csv

Therefore, in order to create high value for farmers, it is necessary to develop a wholesale price model considering the weather. Peaches produced under relatively limited conditions were chosen as subjects of study. The data were collected from 2015 to 2017 provided by okdab 4.0. The meteorological data used for the analysis were generated by weighting the cultivation area and the variables with high correlation among the weather data were selected from the day before to 7 days before. Randomforest, gradient boosting machine, and XGboost were used for the analysis. As a result of analysis, XGboost showed the best performance in the sense of RMSE and correlation, and price prediction was comparatively well predicted, but the accuracy of the trading volume prediction was not so good enough. The top three weather variables affecting to the peach were minimum temperature, average maximum temperature, and precipitation.",xgboost_2018_academic_riss.csv
