We performed penalized regression analysis(Ridge and LASSO) to select a group of variable candidates and chose α=0.01 for the LASSO model with optimal performance. Based on the selected variables, we constructed a model that can predict the prevalence of hypertension in three classification models (SVM, Logistic Regression, and LightGBM) and evaluated their performance with confusion matrices. We confirmed that lightGBM(learning_rate: 0.05, max_depth : 3) showed the best performance with accuracy of 0.67 and F1 Score of 0.76.

This poses a high risk of electric shock accidents due to a short circuit, and a lot of time is required for hose connection and installation of electrical devices. To solve these problems, a Venturi pump using the venturi effect without external power is used. However, Venturi pumps that operate without external power make it difficult to install flow sensors such as electric devices; consequently, it is difficult to check the real-time flow rate. This paper proposes a flow estimation logic to replace the function of the flow sensor for the venturi pump . To develop the flow estimation logic, the flow characteristics of the venturi pump, according to the operating conditions, were checked. After that, the relationship with the flow rate of the venturi pump was defined using a pressure sensor corresponding to a low-cost sensor. Finally, an analysis of the estimation error was performed using the developed flow estimation logic."

The selection of indicators affects the real-time capability and accuracy of the prediction for critical illness. However, the diversity and complexity of these indicators make it difficult to find potential connections between them and critical illnesses. For the first time, this study proposes an indicator analysis model to extract key indicators from the preoperative and intraoperative clinical indicators and laboratory results of critical illnesses. In this study, preoperative and intraoperative data of heart failure and respiratory failure are used to verify the model. The proposed model processes the datum and extracts key indicators through four parts. To test the effectiveness of the proposed model, the key indicators are used to predict the two critical illnesses. The classifiers used in the prediction are light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The predictive performance using key indicators is better than that using all indicators. In the prediction of heart failure, LightGBM and XGBoost have sensitivities of 0.889 and 0.892, and specificities of 0.939 and 0.937, respectively. For respiratory failure, LightGBM and XGBoost have sensitivities of 0.709 and 0.689, and specificity of 0.936 and 0.940, respectively. The proposed model can effectively analyze the correlation between indicators and postoperative critical illness. The analytical results make it possible to find the key indicators for postoperative critical illnesses. This model is meaningful to assist doctors in extracting key indicators in time and improving the reliability and efficiency of prediction."
Multi‑condition dynamic model control strategy of the direct drive motor of electric vehicles based on PIO–LightGBM algorithm,2023,"['Pure electric vehicle', 'Permanent magnet synchronous motor', 'Fast gradient lifting algorithm', 'Multiple working conditions', 'Motor control']",,"Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is widely used in new energy vehicles. At present, to make electric vehicles have a wider speed range, the motor can reach the rated speed above through the field-weakening control. However, when the traditional field-weakening control strategy is above the rated speed, the dynamic response ability of the vehicle declines. Problems such as torque oscillation and current jump occur. To solve these problems, based on a pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) algorithm and optimized light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), the dynamic response capability of the permanent magnet synchronous motor is improved. The robust adaptability of the control system to disturbances and parameter changes is also further improved. By collecting experimental data, the importance of relevant variables is analyzed, and the variable with the largest weight is selected as the input of the model. PIO is used to optimize LightGBM, and the loss function is optimized. Finally, the regression model is established. Simulation and experimental results show that the method is effective."

Among them, senile dementia, which disrupts daily life, is best detected at an early stage because there is no cure, even with technological advances. However, many preliminary studies to predict dementia require continuous imaging data, such as MRI and retinal imaging data, and are expensive. These methods have the disadvantage that they cannot be applied to all people, so this study aims to develop low-cost predictive dementia detection. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the main variables that most influenced the presence of dementia using deep learning prediction models such as XGBsoot and lightGBM by utilizing various activity data such as exercise duration, high-intensity activity duration, and metabolic rate, and sleep data such as deep sleep duration and breathing rate per minute to determine sleep quality. The analysis showed that the best dementia prediction performance was achieved when both activity and sleep data were considered simultaneously, and the most important variable in the XGBoost model was the “activity_score_move_every_hour” and the “sleep_hr_everage” in lightGBM."

Therefore, if it is possible to determine whether or not a person is positive for COVID-19 based on the sound of a cough so that anyone can use it easily, anyone can easily check whether or not they are confirmed at anytime, anywhere, and it can have great economic advantages. In this study, an experiment was conducted on a method to identify whether or not COVID-19 was confirmed based on a cough sound. Cough sound features were extracted through MFCC, Mel-Spectrogram, and spectral contrast. For the quality of cough sound, noisy data was deleted through SNR, and only the cough sound was extracted from the voice file through chunk. Since the objective is COVID-19 positive and negative classification, learning was performed through XGBoost, LightGBM, and FCNN algorithms, which are often used for classification, and the results were compared.

However, in the defense sector, research on the use of acoustic data and AI learning models has not yet been actively conducted.

Therefore, this paper attempts to classify six weapons for the first time using four AI learning models and previously collected acoustic data to derive considerations in the process of collecting acoustic data. The learning data used in the experiment is acoustic data related to Army equipment collected through a government-supported project in the second half of 2021. Experimental results show that the classification performance of CNN and LightGBM models is generally high and the best performance is achieved when the data has a medium length. By uniformly re-configuring the number of data per class using SMOTE, the performance can be further improved. Based on these experimental results, we also propose what should be considered when constructing AI training data for classification of military equipment based on acoustic data."

However, text data can reveal emotional information, which is an important basis for detecting financial fraud. The audit opinion of the financial statement is especially the fair opinion of a certified public accountant on the quality of enterprise financial reports. Therefore, this research was carried out by using the data features of 4,153 listed companies' financial annual reports and audits of text opinions in the past six years, and the paper puts forward a financial fraud detection model integrating audit opinions. First, the financial data index database and audit opinion text database were built. Second, digitized audit opinions with deep learning Bert model was employed. Finally, both the extracted audit numerical characteristics and the financial numerical indicators were used as the training data of the LightGBM model. What is worth paying attention to is that the imbalanced distribution of sample labels is also one of the focuses of financial fraud research. To solve this problem, data enhancement and Focal Loss feature learning functions were used in data processing and model training respectively. The experimental results show that compared with the conventional financial fraud detection model, the performance of the proposed model is improved greatly, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Accuracy reaching 81.42% and 78.15%, respectively."
Prediction and Feature Importance of Earth Pressure in Shields Using Machine Learning Algorithms,2023,['Earth pressure shields Earth pressure prediction Random Forest LightGBM Attention in BPNN Feature importance'],,"To reduce subjectivity and uncertainty when maintaining suitable earth pressure in earth pressure shields that can prevent heave or collapse, many prediction models using machine learning algorithms were proposed, but little research into the effects of other parameters on earth pressure has been undertaken, and soil conditioning parameters are always ignored. To establish a model with thorough parameters and probe into influences of other parameters, multiple machine learning algorithms were attempted. Given the accuracy, diversity and functions, random forest (RF), LightGBM and Attention-back-propagation neural network (Attention-BPNN) were further analyzed. Then, two RF models were compared in this research, one with soil conditioning parameters and the other without. Meanwhile, a case study was utilized to verify the reliability of the model. Finally, the feature importance of three models was compared and the variation rules of the most four important features were discussed by controlling variates. The results showed that soil conditioning parameters delivered a significant reduction in the prediction error. The case study demonstrated that the proposed model can satisfy engineering requirements. More earth pressure should give priority to increasing propulsion pressure, advance rate, and reducing foam air flow, rotational speed of screw conveyor, and vice versa."

In this paper, the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) architecture was applied to the data of the M5 Competition, a famous forecasting competition, and the accuracy of the TFT-based forecasting method was compared with that of the DRFAM method, that had won the competition. The performance was evaluated for the sales data of CA_1 store in the Walmart dataset of the M5 Competition. The TFT models were trained with two data pools at the store level and category level, respectively, and the final forecast was calculated by arithmetically averaging the prediction results of the two models. As a result, the TFT-based method obtained better forecasts than the DRFAM method, which trained six LightGBM models with direct forecasting and recursive forecasting for three levels of data pools and predicted with the arithmetic average of the six trained models. It was found that the TFT-based method had sufficiently learned the relationship between variables and sales volumes in the time-series using the self-attention structure of TFT. While the direct and recursive forecasting models of the DRFAM method require 28 repeated calls for 28 days of forecasting, the TFT-based method can obtain 28 time-series forecasts with a single model call because of its multi-output structure. The proposed TFT-based forecasting method is expected to be applicable to various fields by providing faster and more accurate time-series forecasts."

This study provides three machine learning-based approaches (Gradient boosting, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) regression) for prediction and genetic algorithm (GA) for the optimization of biodiesel yield from waste cooking oil. Throughout the modeling, training, testing, and cross-validation processes, supervised machine learning methods were used to analyze the datasets exhaustively. Four performance indicators (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2) were used to evaluate and contrast the precision of the algorithms. Based on the findings of the coefficient of determination, the LGBM algorithm has the highest prediction accuracy of 0.94048, followed by XGB with 0.8631 accuracy and gradient boosting with 0.8547 accuracy. The optimal condition for producing biodiesel through GA was a molar ratio of 7.62:1 with a catalyst concentration of 0.5 wt%, a reaction temperature of 65 °C, and a reaction time of 105 min and the corresponding value of the biodiesel yield was 98.98% (by wt.). Experiments confirmed this prediction, and with acceptable error, all results are close to the model’s predicted values.
