Naive Bayes-LSTM 기반 예지정비 플랫폼 적용을 통한 화물 상차 시스템의 운영 안전성 및 신뢰성 확보 연구,2023,"['Cargo Loading System', 'Predictive Maintenance', 'Long Short-Term Memory', 'Safety System']",,"Recently, due to the expansion of the logistics industry, demand for logistics automation equipment is increasing. The modern logistics industry is a high-tech industry that combines various technologies. In general, as various technologies are grafted, the complexity of the system increases, and the occurrence rate of defects and failures also increases. As such, it is time for a predictive maintenance model specialized for logistics automation equipment. In this paper, in order to secure the operational safety and reliability of the parcel loading system, a predictive maintenance platform was implemented based on the Naive Bayes-LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) model. The predictive maintenance platform presented in this paper works by collecting data and receiving data based on a RabbitMQ, loading data in an InMemory method using a Redis, and managing snapshot DB in real time. Also, in this paper, as a verification of the Naive Bayes-LSTM predictive maintenance platform, the function of measuring the time for data collection/storage/processing and determining outliers/normal values was confirmed. The predictive maintenance platform can contribute to securing reliability and safety by identifying potential failures and defects that may occur in the operation of the parcel loading system in the future."
단순 베이즈 모형 기반 사용자불만 입력항목 추천 시스템 연구,2023,"['Data quality', ""Bayes's Theorem"", 'Naive Bayes classifier', 'Defense Quailty', 'Customer Complaints']",,"In this study, we use a Naive Bayes classifier to develop a recommender system for data collected in the defense quality field. The Defense Agency for Technology and Quality (DTAQ) collects data of customer complaints, which is generated during the operation and maintenance of weapon systems and munitions; however, data collection is difficult due to unstructured data such as text and image data. Moreover, there is the possibility of human error, especially when text data is assigned a specific class.Therefore, we propose a model for classification recommendation based on Naive Bayes that is one of the most widely used supervised learning models. The model's performance is indicated by the recognition rate, which is 92% to 98%. We expect that high-quality data can be collected by introducing such a recommending scheme into the defense quality field, especially the DTAQ data system. High-quality data will help to improve the quality of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) analysis results in the defense field."
Performance analysis and comparison of various machine learning algorithms for early stroke prediction,2023,"['decision', 'naive Bayes', 'near miss', 'random forest', 'self-training', 'semisupervised learning', 'stroke']",,"Stroke is the leading cause of permanent disability in adults, and it can cause permanent brain damage. According to the World Health Organization, 795,000 Americans experience a new or recurrent stroke each year. Early detection of medical disorders, for example, strokes, can minimize the disabling effects. Thus, in this paper, we consider various risk factors that contribute to the occurrence of stoke and machine learning algorithms, for example, the decision tree, random forest, and naive Bayes algorithms, on patient characteristics survey data to achieve high prediction accuracy. We also consider the semisupervised self-training technique to predict the risk of stroke. We then consider the near-miss undersampling technique, which can select only instances in larger classes with the smaller class instances. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains an accuracy of approximately 98.83% at low cost, which is significantly higher and more reliable compared with the compared techniques."

To achieve this goal, a purposive sampling method was employed to collect data from 214 males and 152 females, totaling 366 participants. Anthropometric measurements and 3D Body Scans were conducted for somatotype classification, and performance metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve), and Log Loss were used to evaluate the machine learning models. All analyses were performed using Python 3.9. The results obtained from this study are as follows: Firstly, the performance of somatotype classification models trained using 3D body images showed that the Ensemble Voting Model exhibited the highest performance. The Neural Network Model (2nd place), Logistic Regression Model (3rd place), SVM Model (4th place), Random Forest Model (5th place), and Naive Bayes Model (6th place) demonstrated favorable learning outcomes in descending order.Secondly, validation of the performance and external validity of the trained models revealed that the Logistic Regression Model (1st place) exhibited the highest performance, followed by the Ensemble Voting Model (2nd place), SVM Model (3rd place), Random Forest Model (4th place), Neural Network Model (5th place), and Naive Bayes Model (6th place), displaying high levels of performance. Thirdly, the feasibility of somatotype classification using 3D body images was confirmed. Based on these results, it is anticipated that through additional data collection and refinement of model performance, an enhanced somatotype classification predictive model with superior performance can be developed."

콘텐츠 유형별 리뷰의 비교 분석연구 : 영화와 음악리뷰를 중심으로,2023,"['Movie Review', 'Music Review', 'Differentiation', 'Text Mining', 'Sentiment Classification', '영화리뷰', '음악리뷰', '차별화', '텍스트마이닝', '감성분류']",,"We analyze the similarities and differences between movie and music reviews and reflect the customers’ needs in creative direction for both content types. The methodology used text mining, topic modeling, and naive Bayes classifiers. R and Python were used as essential tools and supplemented using Leximancer as a text mining tool. We found that movie review tended to be longer than music reviews and that various adjectives and predicates were used in positive reviews compared to negative reviews for both movies and music. More diverse words appeared in the group centered on topics derived using topic modeling. Differences between review types can be indirectly confirmed using positive and negative sentiment classification of reviews and movie and music classification estimation. The model's accuracy demonstrates the differences between reviews. We found that accuracy increased in proportion to the use of discriminatory adjectives or verbs. This study's implication lies in comparing reviews by content type, which has yet to be attempted in previous academic studies. In practice, it is to implement a production feedback system that considers the difference between the methodology of review analysis and the subject of review, which is differentiated by content characteristics."

Therefore, there is a continuous need for research on methods for detecting content polluters. Detection methods using supervised learning techniques of machine learning such as Random Forest and Naive Bayes in the past show relatively high classification accuracy of 98% or more. However, in order to create a learning model, a process of generating training data by identifying features from original data and extracting feature values is required. The identified features represent the characteristics of the classification group well, and the greater the number of features, the higher the classification accuracy. However, the large number of identified features reduces the efficiency of generating a learning model when considering the time required to extract feature values. In order to search for the minimum set of feature combinations that guarantees a certain level of accuracy performance and can improve efficiency, this paper describes a method for searching for minimum scale feature combinations using feature importance, chi-square distribution, and PCA analysis. And, this is compared and evaluated through experiments using Random Forest and deep neural network algorithms."

Human Normalization Approach based on Disease Comparative Prediction Model between Covid-19 and Influenza,2023,"['COVID-19', 'Machine Learning', 'Traditional Korean Medicine']",,"There are serious problems worldwide, such as a pandemic due to an unprecedented infection caused by COVID-19. On previous approaches, they invented medical vaccines and preemptive testing tools for medical engineering. However, it is difficult to access poor medical systems and medical institutions due to disparities between countries and regions. In advanced nations, the damage was even greater due to high medical and examination costs because they did not go to the hospital. Therefore, from a software engineering-based perspective, we propose a learning model for determining coronavirus infection through symptom data-based software prediction models and tools. After a comparative analysis of various models (decision tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, multi-perceptron neural network), we decide to choose an appropriate decision tree model. Due to a lack of data, additional survey data and overseas symptom data are applied and built into the judgment model. To protect from thiswe also adapt human normalization approach with traditional Korean medicin approach. We expect to be possible to determine coronavirus, flu, allergy, and cold without medical examination and diagnosis tools through data collection and analysis by applying decision trees."

In this study, a method combining Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA) technology and machine learning is proposed for lead-zinc mine borehole logging, which can identify lead-zinc ores of different grades and gangue in the formation, providing real-time grade information qualitatively and semi-quantitatively. Firstly, Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain a gamma-ray spectrum data set for training and testing machine learning classification algorithms. These spectra are broadened, normalized and separated into inelastic scattering and capture spectra, and then used to fit different classifier models. When the comprehensive grade boundary of high- and low-grade ores is set to 5%, the evaluation metrics calculated by the 5-fold cross-validation show that the SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor), GNB (Gaussian Naive Bayes) and RF (Random Forest) models can effectively distinguish lead-zinc ore from gangue. At the same time, the GNB model has achieved the optimal accuracy of 91.45% when identifying high- and low-grade ores, and the F1 score for both types of ores is greater than 0.9."
Relevancy contemplation in medical data analytics and ranking of feature selection algorithms,2023,"['data contemplation', 'DEA', 'feature selection', 'TOPSIS']",,"This article performs a detailed data scrutiny on a chronic kidney disease (CKD) dataset to select efficient instances and relevant features. Data relevancy is investigated using feature extraction, hybrid outlier detection, and handling of missing values. Data instances that do not influence the target are removed using data envelopment analysis to enable reduction of rows. Column reduction is achieved by ranking the attributes through feature selection methodologies, namely, extra-trees classifier, recursive feature elimination, chi-squared test, analysis of variance, and mutual information. These methodologies are ranked via Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) using weight optimization to identify the optimal features for model building from the CKD dataset to facilitate better prediction while diagnosing the severity of the disease. An efficient hybrid ensemble and novel similarity-based classifiers are built using the pruned dataset, and the results are thereafter compared with random forest, AdaBoost, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. The hybrid ensemble classifier yields a better prediction accuracy of 98.31% for the features selected by extra tree classifier (ETC), which is ranked as the best by TOPSIS."

People from every aspect of life as well as the entire health system have been severely impacted by this pandemic. Even now, after almost three years of the pandemic declaration, the fear caused by the COVID-19 virus leading to higher depression, stress, and anxiety levels has not been fully overcome. This has also triggered numerous kinds of discussions covering various aspects of the pandemic on the social media platforms. Among these aspects is the part focused on vaccines developed by different countries, their features and the advantages and disadvantages associated with each vaccine. Social media users often share their thoughts about vaccinations and vaccines. This data can be used to determine the popularity levels of vaccines, which can provide the producers with some insight for future decision making about their product. In this article, we used Twitter data for the vaccine popularity detection. We gathered data by scraping tweets about various vaccines from different countries. After that, various machine learning and deep learning models, i.e., naive bayes, decision tree, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, and deep neural network are used for sentiment analysis to determine the popularity of each vaccine.

However, the power system responses to power faults and non-fault disturbances are different.Therefore, it is essential to accurately distinguish between faults and non-fault disturbances in power systems. Previous studies have collected large-scale data by monitoring real-time parameters of the power system and detecting the occurrence of power system faults. However, this study does not focus only on diagnosing power system faults but also on accurately distinguishing between faults and non-faults disturbances and uses various classification models to train the data and evaluate and analyze the prediction results. Collecting power system parameters when faults and non-faults disturbances occur is not easy. Therefore, this study used DIgSILENT PowerFactory software to simulate faults and non-faults disturbances in the power system and collected 120 small data sets. The data collected for the 120 cases consists of various metrics such as voltage, current, frequency, rotor speed, and HVDC parameters. This study used seven classification models for training and prediction: decision tree, gradient boosting classifier, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, naive Bayes classification, and random forest regression. In addition, this study introduced an importance-based data reorganization method to improve the performance of the best-performing classification model and analyzed its effectiveness."
