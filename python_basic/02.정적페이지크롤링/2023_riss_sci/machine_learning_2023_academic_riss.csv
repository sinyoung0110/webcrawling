A Modified Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimization Algorithm With Random Learning Rate for Machine Learning and Deep Learning,2023,"['Deep learning', 'machine learning', 'modified stochastic gradient descent', 'random learning rate', 'steepest descent algorithm.']",,"An optimization algorithm is essential for minimizing loss (or objective) functions in machine learning and deep learning. Optimization algorithms face several challenges, one among which is to determine an appropriate learning rate. Generally, a low learning rate leads to slow convergence whereas a large learning rate causes the loss function to fluctuate around the minimum. As a hyper-parameter, the learning rate is determined in advance before parameter training, which is time-consuming. This paper proposes a modified stochastic gradient descent (mSGD) algorithm that uses a random learning rate. Random numbers are generated for a learning rate at every iteration, and the one that gives the minimum value of the loss function is chosen. The proposed mSGD algorithm can reduce the time required for determining the learning rate. In fact, the k-point mSGD algorithm can be considered as a kind of steepest descent algorithm. In a real experiment using the MNIST dataset of hand-written digits, it is demonstrated that the convergence performance of mSGD algorithm is much better than that of the SGD algorithm and slightly better than that of the AdaGrad and Adam algorithms."
Network Traffic Measurement Analysis using Machine Learning,2023,"['Network traffic measurement', 'Machine learning', 'Network traffic analysis', 'Logistic regression', 'Support vector machine']",,"In recent times, an exponential increase in Internet traffic has been observed as a result of advancing development of the Internet of Things, mobile networks with sensors, and communication functions within various devices. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably led to an explosion of social network traffic. Within this context, considerable attention has been drawn to research on network traffic analysis based on machine learning. In this paper, we design and develop a new machine learning framework for network traffic analysis whereby normal and abnormal traffic is distinguished from one another. To achieve this, we combine together well-known machine learning algorithms and network traffic analysis techniques. Using one of the most widely used datasets KDD CUP'99 in the Weka and Apache Spark environments, we compare and investigate results obtained from time series type analysis of various aspects including malicious codes, feature extraction, data formalization, network traffic measurement tool implementation. Experimental analysis showed that while both the logistic regression and the support vector machine algorithm were excellent for performance evaluation, among these, the logistic regression algorithm performs better. The quantitative analysis results of our proposed machine learning framework show that this approach is reliable and practical, and the performance of the proposed system and another paper is compared and analyzed. In addition, we determined that the framework developed in the Apache Spark environment exhibits a much faster processing speed in the Spark environment than in Weka as there are more datasets used to create and classify machine learning models."

Machine Learning Prediction for the Recurrence After Electrical Cardioversion of Patients With Persistent Atrial Fibrillation,2023,"['Atrial fibrillation', 'Electric countershock', 'Machine learning', 'Recurrence', 'N']",,"Background and Objectives: There is limited evidence regarding machine-learning prediction for the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after electrical cardioversion (ECV). This study aimed to predict the recurrence of AF after ECV using machine learning of clinical features and electrocardiograms (ECGs) in persistent AF patients.Methods: We analyzed patients who underwent successful ECV for persistent AF. Machine learning was designed to predict patients with 1-month recurrence. Individual 12-lead ECGs were collected before and after ECV. Various clinical features were collected and trained the extreme gradient boost (XGBoost)-based model. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the model. The performance was compared to the C-statistics of the selected clinical features.Results: Among 718 patients (mean age 63.5±9.3 years, men 78.8%), AF recurred in 435 (60.6%) patients after 1 month. With the XGBoost-based model, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) were 0.57, 0.60, and 0.63 if the model was trained by clinical features, ECGs, and both (the final model), respectively. For the final model, the sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score were 84.7%, 28.2%, and 0.73, respectively. Although the AF duration showed the best predictive performance (AUROC, 0.58) among the clinical features, it was significantly lower than that of the final machine-learning model (p<0.001). Additional training of extended monitoring data of 15-minute single-lead ECG and photoplethysmography in available patients (n=261) did not significantly improve the model’s performance.Conclusions: Machine learning showed modest performance in predicting AF recurrence after ECV in persistent AF patients, warranting further validation studies."

Ultra-Precision Diamond Turning Error Compensation via Iterative Learning from On-machine Measured Data,2023,"['On-machine measurement', 'Ultra-precision machining', 'Compensation strategy', 'Iterative learning']",,"In ultra-precision diamond turning, the reduction of machining form errors can generally be achieved through on-machine measurement and compensation. However, the efficiency of conventional compensation methods is often insufficient, particularly when high form accuracy is required or when intricate surface topography and microstructures need to be machined. Consequently, this research proposes a novel machining error compensation method based on iterative learning from on-machine measured data to enhance the machining accuracy and compensation efficiency. The on-machine measurement system and cutting path generation algorithm are introduced first. Then, the compensation method via iterative learning is presented theoretically, demonstrating a higher convergence order compared to the conventional method. Finally, machining experiments involving the cutting of cosine surfaces are conducted, followed by measurements of the processed workpieces. The experimental results indicate that after four rounds of compensation using the conventional method, the peak-to-valley (PV) value of the form error is reduced to 0.1134 μm. In contrast, employing the proposed method, a similar value of 0.1156 μmis achieved after only two rounds of compensation. This highlights the significant reduction in compensation time facilitated by the proposed method. Furthermore, the measurement results verify that the proposed compensation method maintains excellent surface quality."

For developing the proposed model, 11,411 data points of adiabatic and condensing flow inside micro, mini and macro channels are collected from 80 sources. The database consists of 24 working fluids, hydraulic diameters from 0.07 to 18 mm, mass velocities from 6.3 to 2000 Kg/m 2 s, and reduced pressures from 0.001 to 0.95.

Machine Learning-assisted Quantitative Mapping of Intracortical Axonal Plasticity Following a Focal Cortical Stroke in Rodents,2023,"['Ischemic stroke', 'Motor cortex', 'Neuronal plasticity', 'Machine learning', 'Support vector machine', 'Neuroanatomical tract-tracing techniques']",,"Stroke destroys neurons and their connections leading to focal neurological deficits. Although limited, many patients exhibit a certain degree of spontaneous functional recovery. Structural remodeling of the intracortical axonal connections is implicated in the reorganization of cortical motor representation maps, which is considered to be an underlying mechanism of the improvement in motor function. Therefore, an accurate assessment of intracortical axonal plasticity would be necessary to develop strategies to facilitate functional recovery following a stroke. The present study developed a machine learning-assisted image analysis tool based on multi-voxel pattern analysis in fMRI imaging. Intracortical axons originating from the rostral forelimb area (RFA) were anterogradely traced using biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) following a photothrombotic stroke in the mouse motor cortex. BDA-traced axons were visualized in tangentially sectioned cortical tissues, digitally marked, and converted to pixelated axon density maps. Application of the machine learning algorithm enabled sensitive comparison of the quantitative differences and the precise spatial mapping of the post-stroke axonal reorganization even in the regions with dense axonal projections. Using this method, we observed a substantial extent of the axonal sprouting from the RFA to the premotor cortex and the peri-infarct region caudal to the RFA. Therefore, the machine learningassisted quantitative axonal mapping developed in this study can be utilized to discover intracortical axonal plasticity that may mediate functional restoration following stroke."

This study provides three machine learning-based approaches (Gradient boosting, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) regression) for prediction and genetic algorithm (GA) for the optimization of biodiesel yield from waste cooking oil. Throughout the modeling, training, testing, and cross-validation processes, supervised machine learning methods were used to analyze the datasets exhaustively. Four performance indicators (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2) were used to evaluate and contrast the precision of the algorithms. Based on the findings of the coefficient of determination, the LGBM algorithm has the highest prediction accuracy of 0.94048, followed by XGB with 0.8631 accuracy and gradient boosting with 0.8547 accuracy. The optimal condition for producing biodiesel through GA was a molar ratio of 7.62:1 with a catalyst concentration of 0.5 wt%, a reaction temperature of 65 °C, and a reaction time of 105 min and the corresponding value of the biodiesel yield was 98.98% (by wt.). Experiments confirmed this prediction, and with acceptable error, all results are close to the model’s predicted values.

Explainable machine learning using perioperative serial  laboratory results to predict postoperative mortality in  patients with peritonitis-induced sepsis,2023,"['Delta neutrophil index', 'Machine learning', 'Peritonitis', 'Postoperative mortality', 'Sepsis']",,"Purpose: Sepsis is one of the most common causes of death after surgery. Several conventional scoring systems have been developed to predict the outcome of sepsis; however, their predictive power is insufficient. The present study applies explainable machine-learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of predicting postoperative mortality in patients with sepsis caused by peritonitis.Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from demographic, clinical, and laboratory analyses, including the delta neutrophil index (DNI), WBC and neutrophil counts, and CRP level. Laboratory data were measured before surgery, 12–36 hours after surgery, and 60–84 hours after surgery. The primary study output was the probability of mortality. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of several machine-learning algorithms using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) 3 models were compared. ‘SHapley Additive exPlanations’ values were used to indicate the direction of the relationship between a variable and mortality.Results: The CatBoost model yielded the highest AUC (0.933) for mortality compared to SAPS3 and SOFA (0.860 and 0.867, respectively). Increased DNI on day 3, septic shock, use of norepinephrine therapy, and increased international normalized ratio on day 3 had the greatest impact on the model’s prediction of mortality.Conclusion: Machine-learning algorithms increase the accuracy of predicting postoperative mortality in patients with sepsis caused by peritonitis."
A Study on the Machine Learning-Based Apartment Price Index,2023,"['주택가격지수', '머신러닝', '인공신경망', '주택가격산정', '평활화', 'House Price Index', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Neural Network', 'House Price Valuation', 'Smoothing']",,"The house price index is essential for assessing the housing market conditions and predicting future changes in the market. However, the two main methods for calculating the housing price index, the appraisal-based index and transaction-based index, have significant drawbacks. The appraisal-based index method has issues such as smoothing and lag bias owing to the involvement of human appraisers, and it also requires significant manpower for calculations. The transaction-based index method requires numerous transaction samples to achieve statistical significance, making it challenging to be created for small regions or when transactions are scarce. To address these issues, we propose an alternative approach that employs a machine learning model to estimate time-series transaction prices for individual apartments and builds a Laspeyres index with the estimated prices. We demonstrated the model’s ability to capture serial correlation of house prices, enabling accurate estimations even with unobserved potential prices. Comparing our prediction-based index to existing Korean house price indices, we observed local smoothing but overall alignment with the global trend of the transaction-based index, facilitating smooth index calculation for small areas. This study offers a novel method for house price index calculation that mitigates limitations of traditional approaches by using machine learning for more precise house price estimation, even with limited housing transaction data."
Novelty class detection in machine learning-based condition diagnosis,2023,['· Condition diagnosis · Anomaly detection · Support vector machine · Principal component analysis · Industrial plant machines'],,"Industrial plant machines have a significantly lower frequency of defective data than the frequency of normal data. For this reason, machine learning is often applied using only some obtained state data. However, the low frequency of defect data does not guarantee that novel data occur, which is why detection of novelty class is required. This paper studies the novelty class detection method in multi-classification. Multi-class support vector machine was used for multi-classification. Cluster-based local outlier factor, histogram-based outlier score, outlier detection with minimum covariance determinant, isolation forest, and one-class support vector machine applied novelty class detection. Anomaly detection algorithms used the hard voting ensemble method. A feature engineering method that is advantageous for novelty class detection was confirmed by comparing the genetic algorithm (GA)-based feature selection and principal component analysis (PCA). Findings show that creating a model using GA-based feature selection for multi-classification and independent PCA for each class for novelty class detection is advantageous. With the use of an independent PCA, the problem was simplified to perform detection on a novelty class with a condition similar to the trained class."
Study on the relationship between machining errors and transmission accuracy of planetary roller screw mechanism using analytical calculations and machine-learning model,2023,"['planetary roller screw mechanism', 'transmission accuracy', 'machining error', 'machine learning', 'analytical calculation']",,"Correlation between machining errors and transmission accuracy of planetary roller screw mechanism (PRSM) plays an important role in tolerance design. In this study, analytical calculations, machine learning, and experimental verification are utilized for exploring the internal correlation between the machining errors and the transmission accuracy of the PRSM. A multi-roller meshing transmission error model is established, which comprehensively considers the eccentric error, nominal diameter error, flank angle error, and cumulative pitch error of the screw, roller, and nut. The importance coefficients of various machining errors on the transmission error are determined using the random forest algorithm. A genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network algorithm-based method is utilized for training the dataset generated via analytical calculations. The results show that the proposed analytical calculation model reflects the alternate meshing characteristics of rollers during the PRSM motion, providing a more accurate prediction of the transmission error than the existing prediction methods. For an actual mean travel deviation, the most significant machining error is the cumulative pitch error of the screw, whereas for the actual bandwidth of useful travel, the most significant machining errors are the eccentric errors of the screw and nut. The proposed prediction formulae for transmission error considering the essential machining errors illustrate reasonable prediction accuracy, with an average error of 10.63% for the actual mean travel deviation and 14.27% for the actual bandwidth of useful travel compared with the experiments, which can effectively support the direct design of PRSM tolerance in engineering practice."
A Study on a Chinese Electric Vehicle Purchase Intention Prediction Model using Machine Learning Analysis,2023,"['Electric Vehicles', 'Purchase Intention', 'Machine Learning', 'MLP', 'SVM']",,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to build a model that predicts Chinese consumers’ intention to purchase electric vehicles and to derive important factors that stimulate purchase intention from the model with the best predictive power.Research design, data, and methodology: To predict Chinese electric vehicle purchase intention model and analyze influencing factors, we applied a machine learning method that is different from existing research. This is because it is suitable for discerning the most effective factor when various factors have a combined influence. We obtained 381 valid samples through the questionnaire and performed a preprocessing process. In addition, we performed artificial neural network analysis, support vector machine analysis, and random forest analysis, which are major models of machine learning.Results: First, we must note the importance of education. This is because the level of education affects consumers’ information processing and decisionmaking process related to purchasing electric vehicles. Consumers with a relatively high level of education have a high understanding of technological information and eco-friendly transportation. Second, individual innovativeness was found to have an effect on Chinese electric vehicle purchase factors. An individual’s innovativeness is related to the ability to adopt new technologies.Since electric vehicles are also new technology products, an innovation mindset plays a role in increasing purchase intention. Third, social awareness affects individual consumption patterns, and the social atmosphere in which electric vehicle purchases become widespread is an important purchasing influence factor.Implications: To develop the Chinese electric vehicle market, a marketing strategy that takes into account the education level of consumers is needed.Additionally, various campaigns should be conducted to allow individuals to experience their innovativeness. Lastly, a strategy to effectively promote government subsidies and support is needed."
Comparative Performance Analysis of Machine Learning-based Indoor-Outdoor Airflow Simulation,2023,"['Computational fluid dynamics', 'artificial intelligence', 'machine learning', 'indoor-outdoor aiflow', 'air curtain']",,"This paper discusses the performance of linear regression, regression tree, support vector regression, and ensemble learners in modelling airflow between two spaces based on accuracy and training time. To obtain training data, different scenarios from an existing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model are simulated via transient analysis using Cradle scSTREAM. The raw dataset is transformed to having time step sizes of 2.5s, 5.0s, and 50.0s. Feature scaling is also employed on the each data set using both min-max scaling and z-score methods for a total of 9 datasets. Hyperparameters according to machine learning (ML) algorithms are varied such that 15 ML models across the four algorithms are developed. The results show that the regression trees perform the best over all other algorithms, with all models maintaining R2 values above 0.95 at the different datasets. On the other hand, as expected, all linear models demonstrated poor performance compared to nonlinear models. Data resolution affects model accuracy and training time, with accuracy declining slightly as time step size increased. It is also found that there is no significant effect of feature scaling. Lastly, ML models yield substantially cheaper simulation costs than CFD to simulate airflow."
Calculated Damage of Italian Ryegrass in Abnormal Climate Based World Meteorological Organization Approach Using Machine Learning,2023,"['Abnormal climate', 'IRG damage', 'Machine learning', 'World Meteorological Organization (WMO)']",,"This study was conducted to calculate the damage of Italian ryegrass (IRG) by abnormal climate using machine learning and present the damage through the map. The IRG data collected 1,384. The climate data was collected from the Korea Meteorological Administration Meteorological data open portal.The machine learning model called xDeepFM was used to detect IRG damage. The damage was calculated using climate data from the Automated Synoptic Observing System (95 sites) by machine learning. The calculation of damage was the difference between the Dry matter yield (DMY)normal and DMYabnormal. The normal climate was set as the 40-year of climate data according to the year of IRG data (1986~2020). The level of abnormal climate was set as a multiple of the standard deviation applying the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standard. The DMYnormal was ranged from 5,678 to 15,188 kg/ha. The damage of IRG differed according to region and level of abnormal climate with abnormal temperature, precipitation, and wind speed from -1,380 to 1,176, -3 to 2,465, and -830 to 962 kg/ha, respectively. The maximum damage was 1,176 kg/ha when the abnormal temperature was -2 level (+1.04℃), 2,465 kg/ha when the abnormal precipitation was all level and 962 kg/ha when the abnormal wind speed was -2 level (+1.60 ㎧). The damage calculated through the WMO method was presented as an map using QGIS. There was some blank area because there was no climate data. In order to calculate the damage of blank area, it would be possible to use the automatic weather system (AWS), which provides data from more sites than the automated synoptic observing system (ASOS)."
Conceptual framework of hybrid style in fashion image datasets for machine learning,2023,"['Fashion image', 'Hybrid style', 'Machine learning', 'K-fashion', 'Supervised learning datasets']",,"Fashion image datasets, in which each fashion image has a label indicating its design attributes and styles, have contributed to the achievement of various machine learning techniques in the fashion industry. Computer vision studies have investigated labeling categories (such as fashion items, colors, materials, details, and styles) to create fashion image datasets for supervised learning. Although a considerable number of fashion image datasets has been developed, different style classification criteria exist because of a lack of understanding concerning fashion style. Since fashion styles reflect various design attributes, multiple styles can often be included in a single outfit. Thus, this study aims to build a Hybrid Style Framework to develop a fashion image dataset that can be efficiently applied to supervised learning. We conducted focus group interviews with six fashion experts to determine fashion style categories with which to classify hybrid styles in fashion images. We developed 1,206,931K-fashion image datasets and analyzed the hybrid style convergence. Finally, we applied the datasets to the machine learning model and verified the accuracy of the computer’s ability to recognize style. Overall, this study concludes that the Hybrid Style Framework and developed K-fashion image datasets are helpful, as they can be applied to data-driven fashion services to offer personalized fashion design solutions."
Development of Prediction Model Using Machine-Learning Algorithms for Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug-Induced Gastric Ulcer in Osteoarthritis Patients: Retrospective Cohort Study of a Nationwide South Korean Cohort,2023,"['Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Stomach ulcer', 'Prediction model', 'Machine learning']",,"Background: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are currently among the most prescribed medications worldwide to relieve pain and reduce inflammation, especially in patients suffering osteoarthritis (OA). However, NSAIDs are known to have adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system. If a gastric ulcer occurs, planned OA treatment needs to be changed, incurring additional treatment costs and causing discomfort for both patients and clinicians. Therefore, it is necessary to create a gastric ulcer prediction model that can reflect the detailed health status of each individual and to use it when making treatment plans.Methods: Using sample cohort data from 2008 to 2013 from the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea, we developed a prediction model for NSAID-induced gastric ulcers using machine-learning algorithms and investigated new risk factors associated with medication and comorbidities.Results: The population of the study consisted of 30,808 patients with OA who were treated with NSAIDs between 2008 and 2013. After a 2-year follow-up, these patients were divided into two groups: without gastric ulcer (n=29,579) and with gastric ulcer (n=1,229). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to develop the prediction model, and a gradient boosting machine (GBM) was selected as the model with the best performance (area under the curve, 0.896; 95% confidence interval, 0.883–0.909). The GBM identified 5 medications (loxoprofen, aceclofenac, talniflumate, meloxicam, and dexibuprofen) and 2 comorbidities (acute upper respiratory tract infection [AURI] and gastroesophageal reflux disease) as important features. AURI did not have a dose-response relationship, so it could not be interpreted as a significant risk factor even though it was initially detected as an important feature and improved the prediction performance.Conclusions: We obtained a prediction model for NSAID-induced gastric ulcers using the GBM method. Since personal prescription period and the severity of comorbidities were considered numerically, individual patients’ risk could be well reflected. The prediction model showed high performance and interpretability, so it is meaningful to both clinicians and NSAID users."
Development of a Prediction Model for the Gear Whine Noise of Transmission Using Machine Learning,2023,"['LASSO', 'Micro geometry of gear', 'Machine learning', 'Gear whine noise', 'Transmission error']",,"This study aims to develop a prediction model using machine learning to predict gear whine noise using the inspection data of gear tooth and noise bench test data in semi-anechoic chambers. To secure the reliability of the collected dataset, we select features that affect the prediction results by the lasso regression method. Based on the selected features, the prediction model was developed according to the characteristics of gear teeth under each vehicle’s driving load condition. Random forest, decision tree, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting (XGB), light gradient boosting model algorithm, and the statistical regression method called ordinary least squares (OLS) are used to construct the prediction models. In addition, the performance of the machine-learning-based models and models using conventional statistical methods are compared. Prediction error reduction rate and prediction performance improvement rate are used to assess the performance of each model. The prediction model using the XGB algorithm exhibits the best performance. The obtained results demonstrate that the machine-learning-based prediction model can be used to predict gear whine noise with higher accuracy than OLS."
Automated detection of panic disorder based on multimodal physiological signals using machine learning,2023,"['anxiety disorder', 'autonomic nervous system (ANS) response', 'deep learning', 'electrocardiogram (ECG)', 'heart rate variability (HRV)', 'machine learning', 'mental stress task', 'multimodal', 'panic disorder', 'physiological signals']",,"We tested the feasibility of automated discrimination of patients with panic disorder (PD) from healthy controls (HCs) based on multimodal physiological responses using machine learning. Electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), respiration (RESP), and peripheral temperature (PT) of the participants were measured during three experimental phases: rest, stress, and recovery. Eleven physiological features were extracted from each phase and used as input data. Logistic regression (LoR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms were implemented with nested cross-validation. Linear regression analysis showed that ECG and PT features obtained in the stress and recovery phases were significant predictors of PD. We achieved the highest accuracy (75.61%) with MLP using all 33 features. With the exception of MLP, applying the significant predictors led to a higher accuracy than using 24 ECG features. These results suggest that combining multimodal physiological signals measured during various states of autonomic arousal has the potential to differentiate patients with PD from HCs."

Among them, organ-on-a-chip or microﬂ uidic devices gave notable results in reconstructing reproducible three-dimen- sional vascularized microenvironments speciﬁ c to certain organs, using various approaches. However, current strategies for quantifying the morphological variation of on-chip microvascular networks (MVNs) merely remain in the 2D domain with limited indicators, which might result in misinterpretations and the loss of biologically signiﬁ cant information. To this end, we introduce a novel machine learning-assisted 3D analysis pipeline that is capable of extracting major assessment param- eters quantifying on-chip MVNs’ morphological variation. We utilized the MV-IMPACT (MicroVascular Injection-Molded Plastic Array 3D Culture) platform for data acquisition, a high-throughput experimental device that oﬀ ers standardized form factor compatibility. Meso-skeletal depiction of the microvasculature and skeleton segmentation via improved graph convolutional network allowed for a more accurate structural analysis of the angiogenic network than any other approach.We show that our method outperforms conventional projection-based analysis by providing satisfactory concordance with manual investigation. Our approach oﬀ ers a diﬀ erent avenue for analyzing the 3D structure of MVNs compared to conven- tional voxel-based methods as it allows for greater ﬂ exibility in handling complex structures, including the lumen. With its robustness and potential for future applications, we anticipate that our method can provide an opportunity to uncover the fundamental aspects of vessel physiology that may have been overlooked, and aid in the development of reliable preclinical models for biopharmaceutical applications."
Machine Learning-Based Work Efficiency Monitoring Method for Student Supervisor,2023,"['Clustering Analysis', 'Student Supervisor', 'Fuzzy c-Means', 'Covariance Distance Measurement', 'Work Efficiency Monitoring.']",,"As student supervisor workloads increase, ensuring efficient support is challenging. A novel machine learning method using clustering analysis is proposed to gain insights into time allocation and identify optimization opportunities. Specifically, a covariance distance measure analysis approach is presented for characterizing the closeness of data items in multi-dimensional cluster analysis through efficient distance measuring. The membership degree of each sample point is first determined concerning class characteristics through the fuzzy c-means ap-proach, which involves first assigning weights to data items. Then, the membership degree is used to determine the degree of dissimilarity between the samples. Finally, the covariance distance measurement between sample points is used as the second optimization criterion to dis-tinguish between data types, and the optimal solution is calculated iteratively by alternating fixed variables to optimize the clustering metric and the distance measurement learning parameters and produce more accurate clustering results. The experimental findings on datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms benchmarks in terms of clustering accuracy. Therefore, the high clustering accuracy empowers the student supervisor to make informed decisions about time allocation, allowing them to optimize their efforts and resources."
EEG Feature Engineering for Machine Learning-Based CPAP Titration Optimization in Obstructive Sleep Apnea,2023,"['Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Sleep Disorder', 'Healthcare', 'Feature Engineering', 'Polysomnography', 'Electroencephalography', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure']",,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the most prevalent sleep disorders that can lead to serious consequences, including hypertension and/or cardiovascular diseases, if not treated promptly. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is widely recognized as the most effective treatment for OSA, which needs the proper titration of airway pressure to achieve the most effective treatment results. However, the process of CPAP titration can be time-consuming and cumbersome. There is a growing importance in predicting personalized CPAP pressure before CPAP treatment. The primary objective of this study was to optimize the CPAP titration process for obstructive sleep apnea patients through EEG feature engineering with machine learning techniques. We aimed to identify and utilize the most critical EEG features to forecast key OSA predictive indicators, ultimately facilitating more precise and personalized CPAP treatment strategies. Here, we analyzed 126 OSA patients' PSG datasets before and after the CPAP treatment. We extracted 29 EEG features to predict the features that have high importance on the OSA prediction index which are AHI and SpO2 by applying the Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method. Through extracted EEG features, we confirmed the six EEG features that had high importance in predicting AHI and SpO2 using XGBoost, Support Vector Machine regression, and Random Forest Regression. By utilizing the predictive capabilities of EEG derived features for AHI and SpO2, we can better understand and evaluate the condition of patients undergoing CPAP treatment. The ability to predict these key indicators accurately provides more immediate insight into the patient’s sleep quality and potential disturbances. This not only ensures the efficiency of the diagnostic process but also provides more tailored and effective treatment approach. Consequently, the integration of EEG analysis into the sleep study protocol has the potential to revolutionize sleep diagnostics, offering a time-saving, and ultimately more effective evaluation for patients with sleep-related disorders."

Machine Learning-Based Proteomics Reveals Ferroptosis in COPD Patient-Derived Airway Epithelial Cells Upon Smoking Exposure,2023,"['Ferroptosis', 'Pulmonary Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive', 'Proteomics', 'Machine Learning', 'Epithelial Cells']",,"Background: Proteomics and genomics studies have contributed to understanding the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but previous studies have limitations. Here, using a machine learning (ML) algorithm, we attempted to identify pathways in cultured bronchial epithelial cells of COPD patients that were significantly affected when the cells were exposed to a cigarette smoke extract (CSE).Methods: Small airway epithelial cells were collected from patients with COPD and those without COPD who underwent bronchoscopy. After expansion through primary cell culture, the cells were treated with or without CSEs, and the proteomics of the cells were analyzed by mass spectrometry. ML-based feature selection was used to determine the most distinctive patterns in the proteomes of COPD and non-COPD cells after exposure to smoke extract.Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data from patients with COPD (GSE136831) were used to analyze and validate our findings.Results: Five patients with COPD and five without COPD were enrolled, and 7,953 proteins were detected. Ferroptosis was enriched in both COPD and non-COPD epithelial cells after their exposure to smoke extract. However, the ML-based analysis identified ferroptosis as the most dramatically different response between COPD and non-COPD epithelial cells, adjusted P value = 4.172 × 10−6, showing that epithelial cells from COPD patients are particularly vulnerable to the effects of smoke. Single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that in cells from COPD patients, ferroptosis is enriched in basal, goblet, and club cells in COPD but not in other cell types.Conclusion: Our ML-based feature selection from proteomic data reveals ferroptosis to be the most distinctive feature of cultured COPD epithelial cells compared to non-COPD epithelial cells upon exposure to smoke extract."

Practical Machine Learning Application for Predicting Axial Capacity of Composite Concrete-Filled Steel Tube Columns Considering Effect of Cross-Sectional Shapes,2023,"['CFST columns', 'Axial capacity', 'Machine-learning', 'Cross-sectional shapes', 'Graphical user interface']",,"Previous studies on machine-learning (ML) prediction of axial capacity of composite concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns under axial loading relate mainly to only one cross-section shape, meaning that they are limited to only one given application. In this paper, a ML model—namely support vector machine (SVM)—is proposed for the prediction of CFST columns with different cross-section shapes: circular, elliptical, square and rectangular, because they are the most widely used in engineering structures. A database consisting of 1093 tests was gathered from the available literature and used to train and validate the SVM model. The model’s performance was quantified by various performance indicators: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error, mean absolute error, Willmott’s index of agreement, and mean absolute percentage error. Based on the SVM model, sensitivity analysis, influence of different factors, parametric study and comparison with the literature are presented. A graphic user interface of the proposed model was also implemented. The model could be extended to study the effect of other cross-sectional shapes, making for wider applicability."

Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO.

This study aimed to develop a good prediction model for the osteoporosis risk using a machine learning (ML) approach in adults over 40 years in the Ansan/Anseong cohort and the association of predicted osteoporosis risk with a fracture in the Health Examinees (HEXA) cohort.Methods: The 109 demographic, anthropometric, biochemical, genetic, nutrient, and lifestyle variables of 8,842 participants were manually selected in an Ansan/Anseong cohort and included in the ML algorithm. The polygenic risk score (PRS) of osteoporosis was generated with a genome-wide association study and added for the genetic impact of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was defined with < −2.5 T scores of the tibia or radius compared to people in their 20s–30s. They were divided randomly into the training (n = 7,074) and test (n = 1,768) sets—Pearson’s correlation between the predicted osteoporosis risk and fracture in the HEXA cohort.Results: XGBoost, deep neural network, and random forest generated the prediction model with a high area under the curve (AUC, 0.86) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) with 10, 15, and 20 features; the prediction model by XGBoost had the highest AUC of ROC, high accuracy and k-fold values (> 0.85) in 15 features among seven ML approaches. The model included the genetic factor, genders, number of children and breastfed children, age, residence area, education, seasons to measure, height, smoking status, hormone replacement therapy, serum albumin, hip circumferences, vitamin B6 intake, and body weight. The prediction models for women alone were similar to those for both genders, with lower accuracy. When the prediction model was applied to the HEXA study, the correlation between the fracture incidence and predicted osteoporosis risk was significant but weak (r = 0.173, P < 0.001).Conclusion: The prediction model for osteoporosis risk generated by XGBoost can be applied to estimate osteoporosis risk. The biomarkers can be considered for enhancing the prevention, detection, and early therapy of osteoporosis risk in Asians."
Assessment of the Impact of Anti-Hormonal Treatment on Bone Health in Patients With Breast Cancer Using Machine-Learning Analysis,2023,"['Antineoplastic agents', 'Bone density', 'Breast neoplasms', 'Machine learning', 'Therapeutics']",,"Purpose: This study analyzed the effects of anti-hormonal treatment (HTx) on bone health using real-world evidence and machine-learning analysis.Methods: We extracted 20 clinical variables and patient history of HTx by reviewing the records of 244 patients treated for breast cancer between January 2014 and June 2018 at Pusan National University Hospital. Baseline and first follow-up dual-energy absorptiometry were analyzed. To identify which of the 20 clinical variables were highly associated with the patients’ bone mineral density and trabecular bone score (TBS), we applied partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and MetaboAnalyst. A self-organizing map (SOM) was used to sort the patient groups based on the selected variables.Results: The patients were classified as ‘no change’ (n=161, 70.6%), ‘deteriorated’ (n=43, 18.9%), or ‘improved’ (n=24, 10.5%) according to the change in TBS during the follow-up period. The baseline TBS value was significantly lower in the improved group. The top five variables (age, HTx, duration of vitamin D and/or calcium intake, cancer stage, and body mass index) were selected using PLS-DA, which generated variable importance value (VIP) scores for all variables and high VIP scores contributed greatly to patient classification. To identify the patients’ clinical patterns using the top five selected variables, a 3×4 grid structure SOM was generated. Clusters were selected to represent the most improved, no change, and most deteriorated groups.Conclusion: This study evaluated the clinical association between HTx and bone health in patients with breast cancer under various clinical conditions and found that the characteristics of patients included in the study were too heterogeneous to be classified in clusters. Therefore, additional data should be collected for future research."

Particularly, classification based on tumor stage plays a crucial role in determining appropriate treatment approaches for kidney cancer patients and predicting post-treatment prognosis. We classified kidney cancer tumor stages into four categories and evaluated their performance. The results demonstrated that the SVM algorithm, utilizing an autoencoder for feature extraction and addressing data imbalance through the SMOTE technique, exhibited the best performance in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and AUC. These results can be utilized to choose the most suitable treatment strategy at the current state and for predicting the prognosis and enabling early diagnosis of kidney cancer."

Improved Tropical Cyclone Track Simulation over the Western North Pacific using the WRF Model and a Machine Learning Method,2023,['Tropical cyclone · Weather Research and Forecasting Model · Machine learning · Artificial neural network · Bias correction'],,"Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) track simulations are required to mitigate property damage and casualties. Previous studieshave generally simulated TC tracks using numerical models, which tend to experience systematic errors due to model imperfections,although the model accuracy has improved over time. Recently, machine-learning methods have been applied tocorrect such errors. In this study, we used an artificial neural network (ANN) to correct TC tracks hindcasted by the WeatherResearch and Forecasting (WRF) model from 2006 to 2018 over the western North Pacific. TC categories that are strongerthan tropical depressions (i.e., tropical storms, severe tropical storms, and typhoons) were selected from June to November,and a bias correction was made to target TC positions at 72 h. The WRF-simulated tracks were used as input variables fortraining and testing the ANN using the best track and reanalysis data. To obtain a reliable corrected result, the number ofneurons in the ANN structure was optimized for TCs during 2006–2015, and the optimized ANN was verified for TCs from2016–2018. Because the performance of the numerical model differed according to the TC track, the ANN was assessed bycluster analysis. The results of the ANN were analyzed using k-means clustering to classify TCs into eight clusters. Overall,ANN with post-processing improved the WRF performance by 4.34%. The WRF error was corrected by 8.81% for clusterswhere the ANN was most applicable."
Development of a City-wide Traffic Accident Prediction Model Using Hybrid Machine-based Learning Approaches,2023,"['Traffic Accident Prediction', 'Modeling Pipeline', 'Hazardous Road Sites', 'Unobserved Heterogeneity', 'Hybrid Modeling']",,"Predicting traffic accidents is a challenging task because taking into account uncertainty in modeling traffic accidents is not trivial. To address these issues, this article develops a hybrid modeling pipeline combining unsupervised and supervised learning to predict the level of hazardous road sites and explore the causality of accidents by controlling unobserved heterogeneity issues effectively. Traffic accident data for Won-ju province, Korea, from 2020 to 2021, and external factors affecting traffic accidents, such as average travel speed and weather information, are combined based on road links. Through the modeling pipeline, a clustering technique is adopted to capture unobserved heterogeneous information among roads. Since traffic accident data contains a wide variety of categorical and hierarchical features, ensemble methods such as boosting techniques were applied to handle heterogeneity issues among these features. To explore the relationship between the accident and determinant factors, are adopted to interpret the results of machine learning models. Model-agnostic methods, however, generally provide results based on images, this study also added a process that extracts texts from images to overcome compatible issues with existing road safety management systems."

Integrating a Machine Learning-based Space Classification Model with an Automated Interior Finishing System in BIM Models,2023,"['BIM', 'Interior Finishing', 'Design Automation', 'Artificial Intelligence']",,"The need for adopting automation technologies to improve inefficiencies in interior finishing modeling work is increasing during the Building Information Modeling (BIM) design stage. As a result, the use of visual programming languages (VPL) for practical applications is growing. However, undefined or incorrect space designations in BIM models can hinder the development of automated finishing modeling processes, resulting in erroneous corrections and rework. To address this challenge, this study first developed a rule-based automated interior finishing detailing module for floors, walls, and ceilings. In addition, an automated space integrity checking module with 86.69% ACC using the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model was developed. These modules were integrated into a design automation module for interior finishing, which was then verified for practical utility. The results showed that the automation module reduced the time required for modeling and integrity checking by 97.6% compared to manual work, confirming its utility in assisting BIM model development for interior finishing works."
Adverse Effects on EEGs and Bio-Signals Coupling on Improving Machine Learning-Based Classification Performances,2023,"['Curse of dimensionality', 'Deep double descent', 'EEG', 'Feature extraction', 'ML', '차원의 저주', '심층 이중 강하', '뇌파', '특징추출', '기계학습']",,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to investigating brain-signal measurement technology using Electroencephalography (EEG). Traditionally, researchers have combined EEG signals with bio-signals (BSs) to enhance the classification performance of emotional states. Our objective was to explore the synergistic effects of coupling EEG and BSs, and determine whether the combination of EEG+BS improves the classification accuracy of emotional states compared to using EEG alone or combining EEG with pseudo-random signals (PS) generated arbitrarily by random generators. Employing four feature extraction methods, we examined four combinations: EEG alone, EG+BS, EEG+BS+PS, and EEG+PS, utilizing data from two widely-used open datasets.Emotional states (task versus rest states) were classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifiers. Our results revealed that when using the highest accuracy SVM-FFT, the average error rates of EEG+BS were 4.7% and 6.5% higher than those of EEG+PS and EEG alone, respectively. We also conducted a thorough analysis of EEG+BS by combining numerous PSs. The error rate of EEG+BS+PS displayed a V-shaped curve, initially decreasing due to the deep double descent phenomenon, followed by an increase attributed to the curse of dimensionality. Consequently, our findings suggest that the combination of EEG+BS may not always yield promising classification performance."

Development of prediction model with machine learning in continuous twin screw granulation,2023,"['Continuous manufacturing', 'Prediction model', 'Machine learning', 'Unsupervised learning', 'Supervised learning']",,"Purpose This study aimed to use machine learning to predict the quality of a drug product prepared through continuous manufacturing.Methods A design of experiment (DoE) was employed to identify the relationship between process parameters in continuous twin screw granulation and intermediate and drug product quality. Subsequently, unsupervised and supervised machine learning were applied to develop a dissolution prediction model. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was conducted to evaluate the similarity between the datasets generated by the DoE. In addition, supervised learning, such as partial least squares (PLS) regression with variable importance in projection (VIP), was conducted, and a prediction model was developed using an artificial neural network (ANN) as a machine learning model. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA), which is an unsupervised learning method, was used to preprocess the ANN model to reduce the number of features.Results HCA divided the data set obtained by DoE into three clusters, and it was confirmed that the L/S ratio significantly affected granule and tablet properties. The ANN, PLS-VIP(0.8)-ANN, PLS-VIP(1.0)-ANN, and PCA-ANN models were developed and statistically compared. The PLS-VIP(0.8)-ANN accurately predicted the dissolution profile with a high coefficient of determination and low mean absolute deviation, root mean square error, and sum of squared errors.Conclusion This paper describes the application of various machine learning algorithms to predict drug product quality as a control strategy of continuous manufacturing."

Predicting Prolonged Wound Drainage after Hemiarthroplasty for Hip Fractures: A Stacked Machine Learning Study,2023,"['Drainage fluid', 'Hip fracture', 'Hemiarthroplasty', 'Stacking', 'Machine learning']",,"Background: Prolonged wound drainage (PWD) is one of the most important reasons that increase the risk of early periprosthetic joint infection after arthroplasty. It is very important to evaluate the risk factors for PWD in the surgical field after arthroplasty surgery. This can be accomplished using machine learning or artificial intelligence methods. Our aim in this study was to compare machine learning methods in predicting possible PWD.Methods: The study was carried out on clinical, laboratory, and radiological data of 313 patients who underwent hemiarthroplasty (HA) for proximal femur fractures.

Liver Fibrosis Biomarker Validation Using Machine Learning Algorithms,2023,"['Liver fibrosis', 'Stiffness measurements', 'M2BPGi', 'Machine learning', 'Random forest', 'Support vector machine']",,"Background: Liver fibrosis which causes several liver diseases, requires early screening and management. The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis.

PSO-based Machine Learning Methods for Predicting Ground Surface Displacement Induced by Shallow Underground Excavation Method,2023,"['Machine learning methods', 'Particle swarm optimization', 'Determination of optimal parameters', 'Prediction of Smax', 'Shallow underground excavation method']",,"Four hybrid intelligent methods are developed to predict the maximum ground surface settlement (Smax) induced by shallow underground excavation method (SUEM). Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with k-fold cross validation is used to determine the optimal hyperparameters or random parameters in the four machine learning (ML) methods, namely that, back-propagation neural network (BPNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF). 100 field engineering samples are collected from published papers. In each data sample, the effect of stratum mechanical conditions, tunnel geometric parameters and construction parameters on Smax is considered. Correlation laws among parameters are investigated through Pearson correlation coefficient, data distribution histogram and correlation confidence ellipse. The performance of four PSO-based ML methods is comprehensively compared by fitness function, time cost and prediction accuracy in the training and test processes. PSO-RF outperforms PSO-SVR, PSO-ELM and PSO-BPNN in the prediction accuracy for Smax owing to larger R2, smaller MAE and RMSE. Calculation time that the optimal hyperparameters are determined is the fastest for PSO-RF, and PSO-ELM has the smallest fitness function. The prediction performance of PSO-RF method for construction parameters is also discussed. This work can provide theoretical guidance for design and construction of SUEM."
Scoping Review of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithm Applications in Veterinary Clinics: Situation Analysis and Suggestions for Further Studies,2023,"['machine learning', 'deep learning', 'veterinary clinics', 'scoping review', 'validation.']",,"Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) algorithms have been successfully applied in medical practice. However, their application in veterinary medicine is relatively limited, possibly due to a lack in the quantity and quality of relevant research. Because the potential demands for ML/DL applications in veterinary clinics are significant, it is important to note the current gaps in the literature and explore the possible directions for advancement in this field. Thus, a scoping review was conducted as a situation analysis. We developed a search strategy following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed and Embase databases were used in the initial search. The identified items were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Information regarding model development, quality of validation, and model performance was extracted from the included studies. The current review found 55 studies that passed the criteria. In terms of target animals, the number of studies on industrial animals was similar to that on com- panion animals. Quantitative scarcity of prediction studies (n = 11, including duplications) was revealed in both industrial and non-industrial animal studies compared to diagnostic studies (n = 45, including duplications). Qualitative lim- itations were also identified, especially regarding validation methodologies. Con- sidering these gaps in the literature, future studies examining the prediction and validation processes, which employ a prospective and multi-center approach, are highly recommended. Veterinary practitioners should acknowledge the current limitations in this field and adopt a receptive and critical attitude towards these new technologies to avoid their abuse."

Placement of Parameter Server in Wide Area Network Topology for Geo-Distributed Machine Learning,2023,"['Geo-distributed machine learning', 'routing', 'wide area networks.']",,"Machine learning (ML) is extensively used in a widerange of real-world applications that require data all aroundworld to pursue high accuracy of a global model. Unfortunately,it is impossible to transmit all gathered raw data to a centraldata center for training due to data privacy, data sovereigntyand high communication cost. This brings the idea of geo-distributed machine learning (Geo-DML), which completes thetraining of the global ML model across multiple data centerswith the bottleneck of high communication cost over the limitedwide area networks (WAN) bandwidth. In this paper, we studyon the problem of parameter server (PS) placement in PSarchitecture for communication efficiency of Geo-DML. Ouroptimization aims to select an appropriate data center as thePS for global training algorithm based on the communicationcost. We prove the PS placement problem is NP-hard. Further,we develop an approximation algorithm to solve the problemusing the randomized rounding method. In order to validate theperformance of our proposed algorithm, we conduct large-scalesimulations, and the simulation results on two typical carriernetwork topologies show that our proposed algorithm can reducethe communication cost up to 61.78% over B4 topology and21.78% over Internet2 network topology."
Seismic Acceleration Estimation Method at Arbitrary Position Using Observations and Machine Learning,2023,"['Machine-learning regression', 'Seismic acceleration prediction', 'Seismic measurement station', 'Supervised learning']",,"This study proposes a method of estimating the measurement data of nearby seismic stations by training an artificial neural network (ANN) through machine learning to understand the seismic acceleration time history at an arbitrary location where seismic acceleration time history is unknown. The ANN is trained using the observation data of 6 earthquakes at 10 ground seismic stations in Korea and 12 earthquakes at 212 underground seismic stations from the Korea Meteorological Administration. The location of the seismic station is assumed to be arbitrary in the untrained observation data to verify the validity of the trained ANN, and the measured and estimated data are compared. It is confirmed that the estimation accuracy of the ANN trained with the observation data of the underground seismic station is higher than that of the ANN trained with the observation data of the ground seismic station. The accuracy of the seismic acceleration estimation method proposed in this study is improved according to the level of learning data. It can also be applied as seismic acceleration to evaluate seismic damage or behavior of structures or facilities, even in places without seismic acceleration."

We employed linear regression, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM algorithms to predict tree growth using monitoring data organized based on different thinning intensities. Furthermore, we compared and evaluated the goodness-of-fit of these models using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The results revealed that XGBoost provided the highest goodness-of-fit, with an R2 value of 0.62 across all thinning intensities, while also yielding the lowest values for MAE and RMSE, thereby indicating the best model fit. When predicting the growth volume of individual trees after 3 years using the XGBoost model, the agreement was exceptionally high, reaching approximately 97% for all stand sites in accordance with the different thinning intensities. Notably, in non-thinned plots, the predicted volumes were approximately 2.1 m3 lower than the actual volumes; however, the agreement remained highly accurate at approximately 99.5%. These findings will contribute to the development of growth prediction models for individual trees using machine learning algorithms."
Machine Learning Approach to Drug Treatment Strategy for Diabetes Care,2023,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'type 2', 'Decision making', 'Hypoglycemic agents', 'Machine learning']",,"Globally, the number of people with diabetes mellitus has quadrupled in the past three decades, and approximately one in 11 adults worldwide have diabetes mellitus. Since both microvascular and macrovascular diseases in patients with diabetes predispose them to a lower quality of life as well as higher rates of mortality, managing blood glucose levels is of clinical relevance in diabetes care. Many classes of antihyperglycemic drugs are currently approved to treat hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with several new drugs having been developed during the last decade. Diabetes-related complications have been reduced substantially worldwide. Prioritization of therapeutic agents varies according to national guidelines. However, since the characteristics of participants in clinical trials differ from patients in actual clinical practice, it is difficult to apply the results of such trials to clinical practice. Machine learning approaches became highly topical issues in medicine along with rapid technological innovations in the fields of information and communication in the 1990s. However, adopting these technologies to support decision-making regarding drug treatment strategies for diabetes care has been slow. This review summarizes data from recent studies on the choice of drugs for type 2 diabetes mellitus focusing on machine learning approaches."

Accurate identification of the severity of hydronephrosis is crucial in clinical management, as high-grade hydronephrosis can cause significant damage to the kidney. In this pilot study, we demonstrate the feasibility of machine learning in differentiating between high and low-grade hydronephrosis in pediatric patients.Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 592 images from 90 unique patients ages 0–8 years diagnosed with hydronephrosis at the University of Chicago’s Pediatric Urology Clinic. The study included 74 high-grade hydronephrosis (145 images) and 227 low-grade hydronephrosis (447 images). Patients were excluded if they had less than 2 studies prior to surgical intervention or had structural abnormalities. We developed a radiomic-based artificial intelligence algorithm incorporating computerized texture analysis and machine learning (support-vector machine) to yield a predictor of hydronephrosis grade.Results: Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the classifier output yielded an area under the curve value of 0.86 (95% CI 0.81–0.92) in the task of distinguishing between low and high-grade hydronephrosis using a five-fold cross-validation by kidney. In addition, a Mann–Kendall trend test between computer output and clinical hydronephrosis grade yielded a statistically significant upward trend (p<0.001).Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning in the differentiation between low and high-grade hydronephrosis. Further studies are warranted to validate our findings and their generalizability for use in clinical practice as a means to predict clinical outcomes and the resolution of hydronephrosis."

A Study on Predictive Modeling of I-131 Radioactivity Based on Machine Learning,2023,"['공간선량률', '머신러닝', '의사결정트리', '랜덤포레스트', 'External Dose Rate', 'Machine Learning', 'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest', 'XGBoost']",,"High-dose I-131 used for the treatment of thyroid cancer causes localized exposure among radiology technologists handling it. There is a delay between the calibration date and when the dose of I-131 is administered to a patient. Therefore, it is necessary to directly measure the radioactivity of the administered dose using a dose calibrator. In this study, we attempted to apply machine learning modeling to measured external dose rates from shielded I-131 in order to predict their radioactivity. External dose rates were measured at 1 m, 0.3 m, and 0.1 m distances from a shielded container with the I-131, with a total of 868 sets of measurements taken.

Patients were randomly assigned to training and internal validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. An external test set of 19 patients (16 male; mean age, 65.3 years) was recruited sequentially from two other tertiary hospitals.

In our previous study, a soft-sensor approach using seven pressure meters has been proposed as an alternative for real-time liquid level estimation. Here, machine learning techniques were used to improve the estimation accuracy and optimize the number of sensors required in this approach. Four algorithms, multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function kernel were compared for this purpose. All models outperformed the cubic model developed in the previous study, among which the ANN and RF models performed the best. Variable importance analysis suggested that the pressure readings from the top (in the headspace) were the most significant, while the other pressure meters showed varying significance levels depending on the model type. The sensor that experienced both headspace and liquid phases depending on the level variation incurred a higher error than other sensors. The results showed that the ML techniques can provide an effective tool to estimate digester liquid levels by optimizing the number of sensors and reducing the error rate."

The presence of a high level of air pollutants can cause severe illnesses such as emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or asthma. Air quality prediction helps us to undertake practical action plans for controlling air pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) reflects the degree of concentration of pollutants in a locality. The average AQI was calculated for the various cities in China to understand the annual trends. Furthermore, the air quality index has been predicted for ten major cities across China using five different deep learning techniques, namely, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Convolutional Neural Network BiLSTM (CNN-BiLSTM), and Convolutional BiLSTM (Conv1D-BiLSTM). The performance of these models has been compared with a machine learning model, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to discover the most efficient deep learning model. The results suggest that the machine learning model, XGBoost, outperforms the deep learning models. While Conv1D-BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM perform well among the deep learning models in the estimation of the air quality index (AQI), RNN and Bi-GRU are the least performing ones. Thus, both XGBoost and neural network models are capable of capturing the non-linearity present in the dataset with reliable accuracy."

Cervical protraction and retraction, which are key components of cervical spine motion, have been studied to assess their role in NSCNP. However, the existing research lacks quantitative assessments and explores nonlinear relationships.Purpose This study explored the relationship between cervical movements during protraction and retraction and NSCNP using machine learning (ML) techniques for classification.Study design Cross sectional study.Methods This study included 277 non-NSCNP and 463 NSCNP office workers. Data were collected from the musculoskeletal screening tests. Two-dimensional video analysis was used to track markers during cervical protraction and retraction. The head tilt angle (HTA), craniovertebral angle (CVA), head excursion angle (HEA), and protraction/retraction distances were measured. Six ML algorithms (random forest, neural network, decision tree, gradient boosting, logistic regression, and support vector machine) were employed to classify individuals with and without the NSCNP. The model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.Results Random forest performed best, with a test AUC of 0.800, followed by decision trees (0.790), and gradient boosting (0.701). Logistic regression and support vector machine had the lowest performance. CVA during retraction, CVA and HEA during protraction were significant predictors of NSCNP in the random forest model, indicating the importance of cervical retraction and protraction kinematics.Conclusions ML models can enhance our understanding of NSCNP and the role of cervical movements. These findings offer potential targets for assessment and intervention in NSCNP cases, and suggest the clinical utility of random forests for classification.

However, this classifier had limitations in its classification performance. Therefore, in this study, we developed an improved machine learning based method of classifying GPS signal reception conditions by including an additional feature with the existing features. Furthermore, we applied various machine learning classification algorithms. As a result, when tested with datasets collected in different environments than the training environment, the classification accuracy improved by nine percentage points compared to the existing method, reaching up to 58%."

A machine learning algorithm with random forest for recognizing hidden control factors from seismic fault distribution,2023,"['machine learning', 'synthetic fault distribution', 'random forest', 'principal component analysis']",,"Stress interaction among many faults in earthquake prone region is strongly affected by the spatial distribution of faults. To build a robust Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for finding hidden relationships between fault distribution and its controlling factors, the performance of ML in dependence of various parameters, such as the complexity and data size of the fault distribution, needs to be investigated. We have, therefore, developed an ML algorithm by combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a Random Forest (RF) to unveil the controlling factors on seismic fault distribution. We synthesized fault images for training of RF classifier ND (> 10,000) fault images, which scattered the faults in a square with R km R km. R, ranging from 200 km to 600 km, is a controlling factor of fault distribution. PCA extracts the dominant features of the seismic fault images to supply the refined training data to the RF. This leads to a dimensional reduction of the data. We tested the influence of the number of principal components (NP) on PCA performance in retaining the information. Larger and more variable R values (i.e., a more complicated fault distribution) with larger amounts of training data required more principal components for a full preservation of the original data. We quantified the optimized NP/ND ratio for an efficient RF classifier, which was about ~0.1 for the evaluating efficacy of the PCA. This showed that the RF classifiers is effective in predicting R values depending on the fault zone with R km × R km and not on specific fault locations. We propose that a small NP, equivalent to ~10% of the training data, suffices for training accurately RF classifier for fault distributions, which can reduce the complexity of fault distribution to understand stress interaction among many faults."
Analysis of machine learning and deep learning prediction models for sepsis and neonatal sepsis: A systematic review,2023,['Machine learningDeep learningSepsisSeptic ShockNeonatal Sepsis'],,"Sepsis and Neonatal sepsis are major challenges in global healthcare because they cause life-threatening organ dysfunction in intensive care adult and pediatric patients due to downregulated host response to a particular infection. Early clinical identification of sepsis is difficult, and failure to provide prompt treatment can often lead to crucial stages and increase the rates of fatality. Thus an intense study is needed to determine and categorize sepsis in its initial stage. The complexity of varying clinical statistics makes it difficult to attain a precise definition in pediatrics. The advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) technologies in the implementation of protocols show promising real-time models for predicting sepsis at the primary stage and thereby reducing the mortality rate. This review article contemplates the complete list of procedures through which sepsis and neonatal sepsis are speculated by ML and DL and concentrates specifically on data available in the adult emergency care unit as well as the neonatal intensive care unit. The survey process was carried out by searching terms related to ML and DL merged with topics concerning sepsis and neonatal sepsis. The literature analysis was carried out from Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases for the period from 2015 to 2022. The assessment of the risk of bias was carried out for the eleven selected papers using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). The eleven papers were selected from different medical care units based on the performance measure AUROC, which ranges from 0.68 to 0.95. Five papers involving ML/DL models reduce the bias and lessen risk occurrence. Five papers generate an increase in bias but can be applied to new data. One paper works with above twenty-five features has high-risk probability but predicts patients within 5–6 h in the future. This survey portrays the role of prediction models that supports the researchers and clinicians for better decision-making and antibiotic administration at an earlier stage."

Electromagnetic machine learning for estimation and mitigation of mutual coupling in strongly coupled arrays,2023,"['Strongly coupled arrays', 'Antenna current’s Green’s function (ACGF)', 'Decoupling MLE lectromagneticsMutual couplingDirection-of-arrival application']",,"With the recent advancement in baseband integrated circuits and radio frequency (RF) technology, there is a strong demand to minimize the size of array-based microwave systems. However, array aperture miniaturization often leads to strong mutual coupling in the arrays. To date, mitigating and/or compensating the mutual coupling (nonlinear) effect remains a technical challenge. For instance, realizing microwave orientations in the presence of strong mutual coupling is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a unified electromagnetic machine learning (EMML) technique for overcoming this challenge. Antenna current’s Green function (ACGF) is employed for characterization of the EM response of elements in form of digital signal processing (DSP) module with the inclusion of mutual coupling effect among the elements. An EMML framework is then formulated and combined with the DSP module based on ACGF, to consequently come up with a nonlinear mutual coupling mitigation framework that provides better decoupling capability than the previous linear techniques. EMML is verified by application to a multiple signal classification (MUSIC)-based direction-of-arrival estimation scenario, and compared with the conventional methods. The results obtained show the validity, effectiveness of the EMML method. This method can be further used in coupled array-based beam forming, steering, and nulling applications."

Thus, now we can record and share respiratory sounds and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted auscultation using ML algorithms distinguishes the type of sounds. Recently, the demands for remote care and non-face-to-face treatment diseases requiring isolation such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection increased. To address these problems, wireless and wearable stethoscopes are being developed with the advances in battery technology and integrated sensors. This review provides the history of the stethoscope and classification of respiratory sounds, describes ML algorithms, and introduces new auscultation methods based on AI-assisted analysis and wireless or wearable stethoscopes."

Riemannian data preprocessing in machine learning to focus on QCD color structure,2023,['Collider physics · Higgs particle · Machine learning · The LHC experiment'],,"Identifying the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) color structure of processes provides additional information to enhance the reach for new physics searches at the large Hadron collider (LHC). Analyses of QCD color structure in the decay process of a boosted particle have been spotted as information becomes well localized in the limited phase space. While these kinds of a boosted jet analyses provide an efcient way to identify the color structure, the constrained phase space reduces the number of available data, resulting in a low signifcance. In this letter, we provide a simple but a novel data preprocessing method using a Riemann sphere to utilize a full phase space by decorrelating QCD structure from kinematics. We can achieve statistical stability by enlarging the size of testable data set with focusing on QCD structure efectively. We demonstrate the power of our method with the fnite statistics of the LHC Run 2. Our method is complementary to conventional boosted jet analyses in utilizing QCD information over a wide range of a phase space."

A Design of the Real-Time Simulation for Wind Turbine Modeling with Machine Learning,2023,"['Wind turbine modeling', 'Machine learning', 'Real-time simulation']",,"Power system operators have recently introduced some AI-based techniques in load prediction, fault diagnosis, scheduling, and maintenance. Operators require a grid analysis that includes wind turbines to mitigate impacts by environmental factors. Among them, a method for modeling wind turbines that reflects the dynamic characteristics and their output characteristics is receiving attention. Recently, a data-based power curve modeling method has been adopted for a simplified model that characteristics as much as possible. However, the simplified EMT simulation is difficult to reflect the output characteristics according to nonlinear wind conditions accurately. This paper proposes a wind turbine model based on artificial neural network techniques using real supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data from a wind farm.

Personal Driving Style based ADAS Customization using Machine Learning for Public Driving Safety,2023,"['Autonomous Vehicles', 'ADAS', 'Machine Learning', 'SVM', 'LSTM', 'GRU', 'Public Driving Safety']",,"The development of autonomous driving and Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) technology has grown rapidly in recent years. As most traffic accidents occur due to human error, self-driving vehicles can drastically reduce the number of accidents and crashes that occur on the roads today. Obviously, technical advancements in autonomous driving can lead to improved public driving safety. However, due to the current limitations in technology and lack of public trust in self-driving cars (and drones), the actual use of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is still significantly low. According to prior studies, people’s acceptance of an AV is mainly determined by trust. It is proven that people still feel much more comfortable in personalized ADAS, designed with the way people drive. Based on such needs, a new attempt for a customized ADAS considering each driver’s driving style is proposed in this paper. Each driver’s behavior is divided into two categories: assertive and defensive. In this paper, a novel customized ADAS algorithm with high classification accuracy is designed, which divides each driver based on their driving style. Each driver’s driving data is collected and simulated using CARLA, which is an open-source autonomous driving simulator. In addition, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) machine learning algorithms are used to optimize the ADAS parameters. The proposed scheme results in a high classification accuracy of time series driving data. Furthermore, among the vast amount of CARLA-based feature data extracted from the drivers, distinguishable driving features are collected selectively using Support Vector Machine (SVM) technology by comparing the amount of influence on the classification of the two categories. Therefore, by extracting distinguishable features and eliminating outliers using SVM, the classification accuracy is significantly improved. Based on this classification, the ADAS sensors can be made more sensitive for the case of assertive drivers, enabling more advanced driving safety support. The proposed technology of this paper is especially important because currently, the state-of-the-art level of autonomous driving is at level 3 (based on the SAE International driving automation standards), which requires advanced functions that can assist drivers using ADAS technology."

Particularly, Korea is one of the countries experiencing a rapid transition of demographic and household structures, and accordingly, the current and future energy demand could be significantly affected.As per the importance of the understanding the energy demand characteristics, this study contributes to understanding the electricity consumption of households by analyzing how the various household characteristics can be used to understand the household’s electricity consumption with household-level survey and machine learning techniques. This study utilizes the Household Energy Standing Survey published in 2022 and selects key household, housing, and appliance ownership and usage characteristics from the entire dataset. Afterward, the study applies Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers to classify the household’s monthly electricity consumption. The results suggest that the Random Forest classifier provides slightly better performances in general compared to the other models. Moreover, the feature importance suggests that the housing characteristics, such as the size of housing, and appliance usage information, and some household characteristics, such as the number of household members and household income, are relatively important features for classification. Although the study finds some evidence of the importance of household and behavioral information in understanding the household’s electricity consumption, the study also identifies the limitation of the survey dataset in extracting the behavioral information."

In parameter optimization, a search is generally done to minimize the magnitude of overall errors. However, under- and overestimation errors are not equivalent in flood forecasting since underestimation of the water level leads to delays in decision making. We propose a risk-aware forecasting method that uses a weighted loss function. We applied the proposed method to both physics-based models and machine learning models and compared the prediction results to clarify the difference in the prediction results according to the base model used. The results show that the model optimized by the weighted loss function reduced the underestimation error while maintaining the overall error."

However, their energy resolution is poor and radionuclide identification is nearly unfeasible. In this study, to improve isotope identification, a RPM system based on a multi-array plastic scintillator and convolutional neural network (CNN) was evaluated by measuring the spectra of radioactive sources. A multi-array plastic scintillator comprising an assembly of 14 hexagonal scintillators was fabricated within an area of 50 × 100 cm2. The energy spectra of 137Cs, 60Co, 226Ra, and 4K (KCl) were measured at speeds of 10–30 km/h, respectively, and an energy-weighted algorithm was applied. For the CNN, 700 and 300 spectral images were used as training and testing images, respectively. Compared to the conventional plastic scintillator, the multi-arrayed detector showed a high collection probability of the optical photons generated inside. A Compton maximum peak was observed for four moving radiation sources, and the CNN-based classification results showed that at least 70% was discriminated. Under the speed condition, the spectral fluctuations were higher than those under dwelling condition. However, the machine learning results demonstrated that a considerably high level of nuclide discrimination was possible under source movement conditions"
3D Printing Monitoring System Based on Supervised Machine Learning,2023,"['Tensile Strength', 'Overlap Rate', 'Scan Speed', 'Laser Power']",,"One of the additive manufacturing processes that is quickly evolving is metal 3D printing. Selective laser melting (SLM) is one of the popular methods for metal 3D printing. Although it has many advantages and capabilities, there are still unsolved problems like process monitoring and printing reliability. Printing high-quality robust products require appropriate parameter settings and real-time monitoring. In order to satisfy the requirement, we propose a new monitoring system based on multiple sensors that can measure the index of different quality affecting parameters of SLM 3D printing. The system serves to improve printing quality; it involves supervised machine learning to predict the expected tensile strength of the printed product. We trained the machine learning model on our new “tensile strength” dataset which includes multiple sensing data and indexes of tensile strength. While collecting data we printed products that have a tensile strength between 449 and 506 MPa. A number of SLM 3D printing tests are carried out to show the viability of the proposed approach. After testing the tensile strength of the printed product, test results were compared to the results of the tensile strength predicting model. According to experiments, the monitoring system showed satisfactory results predicting expected tensile strength. The highest accuracy has been achieved with Multiple Linear Regression, recording 97%. The monitoring system helps not only to predict the tensile strength of the printing product but also to find optimal parameter settings of the SLM printer."

Innovative chemical-based iron extraction processes exist, albeit being costly. Therefore, iron removal using easily accessible plants is the most sustainable alternative. The bioadsorption of iron by Ocimum sanctum Linn. leaves (OSL) and Syzygium cumini seed (SCS) biomass was examined considering several parameters viz. pH, biomass quantity, time of contact, initial iron metal concentration and temperature, etc. The adsorption process appears spontaneous, feasible, and exothermic. The batch adsorption of iron obeyed Langmuir isotherm and pseudo first order kinetic model for both bioadsorbents. Monolayer adsorption capacities (mg/g) were 123.26 (OSL) and 96.25 (SCS). OSL biomass proves more effective in removing iron than SCS biomass. Artificial neural network (ANN) and Support vector machine (SVM) were used to develop predictive model. The results showed that both models revealed good abilities for predicting the % removal of iron. To assess the prediction performance of ANN and SVM models statistical methods (R2 and MSE) were employed. The SVM outperformsANN in terms of prediction performance.

This paper employed machine learning (ML) using the U.S. nationwide stated choice experiment to understand how travelers adopt new transportation modes or continue to use conventional modes of transportation. Specifically, this study used interpretable ML to investigate the optimal algorithm (i.e., stochastic gradient boosting decision tree model) in greater depth, including feature importance and non-linear marginal effects. Several notable findings in this study add further understanding. First, the findings of permutation-based feature importance suggest that transportation mode choice behavior in the era of AVs would be significantly influenced by the level of services of each transportation mode and individual attitudes toward driving, AVs, technology, and alternative transportation modes. Moreover, direct marginal effect estimations regarding the crucial factors reveal that the non-linear relationships indicate that the effects were generally noticeable within certain ranges across different transportation modes; specifically, many showed a threshold effect at a certain unit change. The paper contributes to (1) exploring how people would react to a variety of transportation modes likely to coexist, including private AVs, shared mobility services, and conventional transportation modes, (2) supporting the decision-making process through crucial underlying knowledge not currently available, and (3) elaborating the limitations of ML for transportation mode choice modeling and suggests potential future avenues for methodological improvement."
Prediction of Tool Tip Dynamics Through Machine Learning and Inverse Receptance Coupling,2023,"['Receptance coupling', 'Artificial neural network', 'Milling', 'Dynamics']",,"The monitoring of cutting forces during machining operations can provide information pertaining to tool wear and deflection. The cutting forces are influenced by the cutting parameters and system dynamics. To increase the efficiency of the cutting operations and to improve the quality of the finished products, the cutting parameters must be established within the stable limits of the machine tool. The identification of the dynamics of machine tools is therefore critical for ensuring a fast, efficient, and safe cutting operation. While the receptance coupling (RC) method is commonly utilized to determine the dynamics of machine tools and the chatter stability limits, its application necessitates multiple experiments in conjunction with finite element (FE) simulations, which can be complex and time-consuming to perform on a factory floor. To address these challenges, this study investigates the application of the artificial neural networks (ANNs) for predicting the frequency response functions (FRFs) of the tooling assembly. Multiple ANNs are trained to predict the FRFs of the tool-tool holder assembly, resulting in a significant reduction in the simulation time. The input and output training sets are generated using a validated FE software. Once the ANNs are trained, the predicted FRFs of the tooling assembly are combined with the FRFs of the machine through the RC method to obtain the tool tip dynamics."

Existing age-based formulae for selecting the optimal ETT size present several inaccuracies. We developed a machine learning model that predicts the optimal size and depth of ETTs in pediatric patients using demographic data, enabling clinical applications. Methods: Data from 37,057 patients younger than 12 years who underwent general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were retrospectively analyzed. Gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) model was developed and compared with traditional age-based formulae. Results: The GBRT model demonstrated the highest macro-averaged F1 scores of 0.502 (95% CI 0.486, 0.568) and 0.669 (95% CI 0.640, 0.694) for predicting the uncuffed and cuffed ETT size (internal diameter [ID]), outperforming the age-based formulae that yielded 0.163 (95% CI 0.140, 0.196, P < 0.001) and 0.392 (95% CI 0.378, 0.406, P < 0.001), respectively. In predicting the ETT depth (distance from tip to lip corner), the GBRT model showed the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.71 cm (95% CI 0.69, 0.72) and 0.72 cm (95% CI 0.70, 0.74) compared to the age-based formulae that showed an error of 1.18 cm (95% CI 1.16, 1.20, P < 0.001) and 1.34 cm (95% CI 1.31, 1.38, P < 0.001) for uncuffed and cuffed ETT, respectively.Conclusions: The GBRT model using only demographic data accurately predicted the ETT size and depth.

A comparison of imputation methods using machine learning models,2023,"['KNN imputation', 'multiple imputation', 'missForest', 'missRanger', 'mixgb']",,"Handling missing values in data analysis is essential in constructing a good prediction model. The easiest way to handle missing values is to use complete case data, but this can lead to information loss within the data and invalid conclusions in data analysis. Imputation is a technique that replaces missing data with alternative values obtained from information in a dataset. Conventional imputation methods include K-nearest-neighbor imputation and multiple imputations. Recent methods include missForest, missRanger, and mixgb ,all which use machine learning algorithms. This paper compares the imputation techniques for datasets with mixed datatypes in various situations, such as data size, missing ratios, and missing mechanisms. To evaluate the performance of each method in mixed datasets, we propose a new imputation performance measure (IPM) that is a unified measurement applicable to numerical and categorical variables. We believe this metric can help find the best imputation method. Finally, we summarize the comparison results with imputation performances and computational times."

The final model was determined using the Shapley Additive Explanations method. The final model shows similar prediction performance to the base model, though it has only 11 features (30 % of the Base model). The final model shows 15.76 for the root mean square error and 0.965 for R2 with the test data. By extracting the dominant features influencing NOx prediction, we could develop a lightweight and accurate NOx prediction model."
An Integrated Accurate-Secure Heart Disease Prediction (IAS) Model using Cryptographic and Machine Learning Methods,2023,"['Heart Disease Prediction', 'accuracy', 'integrity', 'Machine learning', 'feature extraction', 'Neural networks']",,"Heart disease is becoming the top reason of death all around the world. Diagnosing cardiac illness is a difficult endeavor that necessitates both expertise and extensive knowledge. Machine learning (ML) is becoming gradually more important in the medical field. Most of the works have concentrated on the prediction of cardiac disease, however the precision of the results is minimal, and data integrity is uncertain. To solve these difficulties, this research creates an Integrated Accurate-Secure Heart Disease Prediction (IAS) Model based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Heart-related medical data is collected and pre-processed. Secondly, feature extraction is processed with two factors, from signals and acquired data, which are further trained for classification. The Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) is used to categorize received sensor data as normal or abnormal. Furthermore, the results are safeguarded by implementing an integrity validation mechanism based on the hash algorithm. The system's performance is evaluated by comparing the proposed to existing models. The results explain that the proposed model-based cardiac disease diagnosis model surpasses previous techniques. The proposed method demonstrates that it attains accuracy of 98.5 % for the maximum amount of records, which is higher than available classifiers."
Effect of Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning on Prediction of Hip Fracture Risk: Systematic Review,2023,['Artificial intelligence · Diagnosis · Hip fractures · Machine learning · Prognosis'],,"Background: Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a preferred modality for screening or diagnosis of osteoporosis and can predict the risk of hip fracture. However, the DXA test is difficult to implement easily in some developing countries, and fractures have been observed before patients underwent DXA. The purpose of this systematic review is to search for studies that predict the risk of hip fracture using artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning, organize the results of each study, and analyze the usefulness of this technology. Methods: The PubMed, OVID Medline, Cochrane Collaboration Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, and AHRQ databases were searched including “hip fractures” AND “artificial intelligence”. Results: A total of 7 studies are included in this study. The total number of subjects included in the 7 studies was 330,099. There were 3 studies that included only women, and 4 studies included both men and women. One study conducted AI training after 1:1 matching between fractured and non-fractured patients. The area under the curve of AI prediction model for hip fracture risk was 0.39 to 0.96. The accuracy of AI prediction model for hip fracture risk was 70.26% to 90%. Conclusions: We believe that predicting the risk of hip fracture by the AI model will help select patients with high fracture risk among osteoporosis patients. However, to apply the AI model to the prediction of hip fracture risk in clinical situations, it is necessary to identify the characteristics of the dataset and AI model and use it after performing appropriate validation."
Analysis of Japan's CPTPP Trade Effect Using Gravity Model and Machine Learning Approach,2023,"['CPTPP', 'trade effect', 'gravity model', 'FTA', 'machine learning']",,"In 2022, the Korean government announced its intention to join the CPTPP, led by Japan and launched in 2018, which aims to achieve comprehensive tariff abolition and establish new trade norms. According to our analysis, as with traditional gravity model outcomes, it appears that the greater the per capita GDP and the shorter the distance between countries, the greater the effect on promoting trade. However, the trade-enhancing effect after the enforcement of the CPTPP has not yet been clearly confirmed. Nevertheless, if tariff abolition and reduction proceed as planned, the trade-enhancing effect of the CPTPP is expected to gradually expand. On the other hand, an increase in trade between Japan and CPTPP member countries may suggest a potential contraction in trade with non-member countries. This could pose a threat to Korean industries that need to establish a stable supply chain within the Asia-Pacific region. As Japan is South Korea's fourth largest trading partner, a detailed review of the impact of the CPTPP on future trade between Japan and its member countries should form the basis for discussions on Korea's possible participation in the CPTPP and the content of negotiations."

The model uses a deep learning neural network composed of a 2-layer LSTM network to automatically extract features from the collected human body feature information. Then, the multi-class motion patterns are modeled in time series to quickly identify different motion patterns in real time. To evaluate the performance of this model, the effectiveness of this method in identifying six different motion modes is validated using an open dataset. At the same time, this method is compared with four methods based on in-depth learning model. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the method. It provides a feasible method for human motion recognition and modeling based on capture data in video animation."
"Comparison of intracranial pressure prediction in hydrocephalus patients among linear, non-linear, and machine learning regression models in Thailand",2023,"['hydrocephalus', 'intracranial pressure', 'linear regression', 'machine learning', 'prediction']",,"Background: Hydrocephalus (HCP) is one of the most significant concerns in neurosurgical patients because it can cause increased intracranial pressure (ICP), resulting in mortality and morbidity. To date, machine learning (ML) has been helpful in predicting continuous outcomes. The primary objective of the present study was to identify the factors correlated with ICP, while the secondary objective was to compare the predictive performances among linear, non-linear, and ML regression models for ICP prediction. Methods: A total of 412 patients with various types of HCP who had undergone ventriculostomy was retrospectively included in the present study, and intraoperative ICP was recorded following ventricular catheter insertion. Several clinical factors and imaging parameters were analyzed for the relationship with ICP by linear correlation. The predictive performance of ICP was compared among linear, non-linear, and ML regression models. Results: Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) had a moderately positive correlation with ICP (r=0.530, P<0.001), while several ventricular indexes were not statistically significant in correlation with ICP. For prediction of ICP, random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms had low mean absolute error and root mean square error values and high R2 values compared to linear and non-linear regression when the predictive model included ONSD and ventricular indexes. Conclusions: The XGBoost and RF algorithms are advantageous for predicting preoperative ICP and establishing prognoses for HCP patients. Furthermore, ML-based prediction could be used as a non-invasive method."
Triggering strategy for defragmentation process in Elastic Optical Networks using Machine Learning techniques,2023,['Elastic Optical NetworksLink fragmentationSpectrum defragmentationMachine Learning'],,"Bandwidth fragmentation is a critical problem for Elastic Optical Networks (EON), and spectrum defragmentation is the most important strategy to mitigate this phenomenon. In this work we propose a Machine Learning (ML) based method for estimating the Blocking Rate, which, when exceeding a threshold, triggers a defragmentation process. This is done in order to achieve better results in terms of the number of blocking demands and the number of re-routed connections. The performance of the proposed method was compared with two other known strategies: fixed-time (FT) defragmentation, and triggering based on one fragmentation metric (BFR). Simulation results were evaluated using two multi-objective metrics. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more efficient than the other two, being the best method in 85.7% of comparisons using the Pareto Coverage metric, and obtaining 47.4% of non-dominated solutions in the Pareto Front."

The framework consists of three parts: graph generation, subgraph extraction, and graph classification. Graphs are generated through symbol recognition and line recognition, and subgraphs are extracted using the frequent subgraph mining algorithm. The graph classification targets are divided into two categories according to the frequency of the main equipment of the extracted subgraph. If the frequency is low, it is classified through whether to include a user-defined subgraph, and if it is high, it is trained in a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm after vector embedding to generate a classification model. K-fold cross-validation is also applied to increase classification accuracy. The proposed framework shows 85% accuracy for a given test drawing through cross-validation. These outcomes contribute to the field of engineering diagram analysis and have potential applications in plant industries."

The identification of differentially expressed genes and related pathways among affected brain regions can provide more information on the mechanisms of AD. The aim of our study was to identify differentially expressed genes associated with AD and combined biomarkers among them to improve AD risk prediction accuracy.Methods  Machine learning methods were used to compare the performance of the identified combined biomarkers. In this study, three publicly available gene expression datasets from the hippocampal brain region were used.Results  We detected 31 significant common genes from two different microarray datasets using the limma package.

The constructed predictive nomogram using combined biomarkers could easily be used by clinicians to identify high-risk individuals so that more efficient trials could be designed to reduce the incidence of AD."
Prediction of Microsatellite Instability in Colorectal Cancer Using a Machine Learning Model Based on PET/CT Radiomics,2023,"['Colorectal cancer', 'microsatellite instability', 'positron emission tomography', 'image analysis', 'machine learning']",,"Purpose: We investigated the feasibility of preoperative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) radiomics with machine learning to predict microsatellite instability (MSI) status in colorectal can cer (CRC) patients.Materials and Methods: Altogether, 233 patients with CRC who underwent preoperative FDG PET/CT were enrolled and divided into training (n=139) and test (n=94) sets. A PET-based radiomics signature (rad_score) was established to predict the MSI status in patients with CRC. The predictive ability of the rad_score was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating character istic curve (AUROC) in the test set. A logistic regression model was used to determine whether the rad_score was an independent predictor of MSI status in CRC. The predictive performance of rad_score was compared with conventional PET parameters.Results: The incidence of MSI-high was 15 (10.8%) and 10 (10.6%) in the training and test sets, respectively. The rad_score was constructed based on the two radiomic features and showed similar AUROC values for predicting MSI status in the training and test sets (0.815 and 0.867, respectively; p=0.490). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the rad_score was an independent pre dictor of MSI status in the training set. The rad_score performed better than metabolic tumor volume when assessed using the AUROC (0.867 vs. 0.794, p=0.015).Conclusion: Our predictive model incorporating PET radiomic features successfully identified the MSI status of CRC, and it also showed better performance than the conventional PET image parameters."

Factors influencing fatal vehicle-involved crash consequence metrics at spatio-temporal hotspots in South Korea: application of GIS and machine learning techniques,2023,"['Spatio-temporal hotspot analysis', 'fatal crash', 'intersection', 'temporal trends', 'machine learning', 'pedestrian']",,"Studies have employed several techniques to identify the effect of individual risk factors influencing crashes at hotspot locations. Nevertheless, as crashes are sometimes influenced by a combination of risk factors, identifying the chains of factors collectively contributing to fatal crashes at hotspot locations could provide added insights for improving traffic safety. By employing fatal crash data from Korea, this study identifies hotspots with increasing (critical) and decreasing (diminishing) temporal trends using a spatio-temporal hotspot analysis tool in GIS. Further, a machine learning technique is employed to explore the chains of factors influencing the number of vehicles and the number of casualties involved in fatal crashes at intersections and midblocks in each hotspot type identified. In general, results showed that minibuses/vans and construction vehicles were mainly at fault for fatal single-vehicle pedestrian-involved crashes. While many casualties and vehicles are likely to be involved in crashes at midblocks during the daytime regardless of the hotspot type, the nighttime variable was particularly associated with large casualty-size crashes at critical intersection hotspots. Further, while reckless driving was mostly associated with single-vehicle crashes at intersections in diminishing hotspots, pedestrian protection, and improper centreline crossing violations were more pronounced at midblocks in diminishing hotspots. This analysis identified groups of factors that could be collectively controlled to improve road safety and proposed countermeasures to mitigate fatal crashes on roadways."

Exploring Cloud Computing Adoption in an Organization Context through the Dual Perspectives: Structural Equation Modeling and Machine Learning Approach,2023,"['Cloud Computing', 'System Dependability', 'Structural Equation Modeling', 'Artificial Neural Networks', 'Technology Acceptance']",,"The goal of this study was to identify factors that determine the acceptance of cloud computing (CC), by integrating dependability attributes with the technology acceptance model. Simultaneous application of structural equation modeling (SEM) and machine learning (ML) indicates that availability, reliability and maintainability are direct predictors of CC acceptance, but security is not. Availability and reliability act as antecedents on the usefulness and the ease of CC, but the effect of security on CC is significant only in the case of the relationship with the ease of use of CC. CC acceptance is predicted by the usefulness, and the ease to use mediates the relationships between dependability attributes and usefulness. Overall, the ML achieved higher prediction accuracy than SEM. This study provides researchers and practitioners with empirical evidence to deepen understanding of the drivers of CC acceptance."

To verify the efficiency of subjective questionnaire information, we tested whether the driver with slow or fast reengagement and stabilization time can be detected based on machine learning techniques and obtained results. We expect to apply these results to training programs for autonomous vehicles' users and personalized human-vehicle interfaces for future autonomous vehicles."

This study proposes a fault identification method for electromechanical systems based on functional data feature engineering and multi-layer kernel extreme learning machine (MLKELM) optimized by sparrow search algorithm (SSA). First, multiple time series signals under different fault conditions are functionalized under the B-spline basis function system, and the feature reduction space is constructed by functional principal component analysis (FPCA) and principal differential analysis (PDA) to extract fault features. Second, the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (mRMR) method is performed on the initial feature set for feature selection.

Development of Machine Learning Based Microclimatic HVAC System Controller for Nano Painted Rooms Using Human Skin Temperature,2023,"['Heating ventilation and air conditioning', 'Occupancy estimation', 'Nano coating', 'Gaussian process regression', 'Setpoint temperature prediction', 'Energy savings']",,"In this paper, a microclimatic data based occupancy regression controller (ORC) is proposed for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and is termed microclimatic HVAC (M-HVAC). Microclimatic data consist of various measurements such as PIR, CO2, humidity, wall, floor and roof temperatures, as well as human skin temperature for the prediction of the optimal thermal setpoint temperature in an M-HVAC system. Microclimatic conditions have a major role in building energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort. Human skin temperature, wall, floor and roof temperatures in the room are obtained through a thermal camera. ORC controller performance is evaluated on the SiO2 nanocoated room walls for high energy savings. Up until now, researchers have focused on the optimization of thermal setpoint temperature (SPT) using indoor air temperature and room occupant count data, but have never addressed the microclimatic conditions. ORC predicts the optimal SPT after including the microclimate data. M-HVAC systems implement the ORC using a Raspberry Pi board connected with sensors and a thermal camera. ORC leads to thermal comfort in a room and reduces energy consumption.

Predicting CAM generation times through machine learning for cellular V2X communication,2023,['V2XCooperative Awareness MessageCongestion controlMachine learningPrediction'],,"In the narrow Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) band, avoiding wireless channel congestion is essential. Reporting vehicle kinematics in the Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) only when there are notable changes in vehicle dynamics is a standardized approach to reducing bandwidth usage of periodic CAM messages that are exchanged between vehicles, and is called the CAM generation rule. However, in cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, aperiodicity due to frequent omissions of periodic CAM raises problems of resource waste and instability in resource scheduling. The problem can be solved by reserving a resource only for actual CAM transmission times in the future. This article demonstrates that a neural network-based scheme can predict the next CAM generation times at an average accuracy of over 94%, which can be utilized for resource reservation under the CAM generation rule."
Spatio-Temporal Projection of Invasion Using Machine Learning Algorithm-MaxEnt,2023,"['Ageratina adenopora', 'climate change', 'invasion', 'MaxEnt']",,"Climate change and invasive alien plant species (IAPs) are having a significant impact on mountain ecosystems. The combination of climate change and socio-economic development is exacerbating the invasion of IAPs, which are a major threat to biodiversity loss and ecosystem functioning. Species distribution modelling has become an important tool in predicting the invasion or suitability probability under climate change based on occurrence data and environmental variables. MaxEnt modelling was applied to predict the current suitable distribution of most noxious weed A. adenophora (Spreng) R. King and H. Robinson and analysed the changes in distribution with the use of current (year 2000) environmental variables and future (year 2050) climatic scenarios consisting of 3 representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) in Bhutan. Species occurrence data was collected from the region of interest along the road side using GPS handset. The model performance of both current and future climatic scenario was moderate in performance with mean temperature of wettest quarter being the most important variable that contributed in model fit. The study shows that current climatic condition favours the A. adenophora for its invasion and RCP 2.6 climatic scenario would promote aggression of invasion as compared to RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climatic scenarios. This can lead to characterization of the species as preferring moderate change in climatic conditions to be invasive, while extreme conditions can inhibit its invasiveness. This study can serve as reference point for the conservation and management strategies in control of this species and further research."
Long-term Predictors of Cardiovascular Disease: A Machine Learning Approach,2023,"['BMI', 'CVD', 'Lasso', 'odds ratio', 'marginal effect']",,"This study investigates long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk predictors for middle-aged and older adults in Korea. Using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) and the double-selection Lasso, this study provides novel evidence that Body Mass Index (BMI) is a single risk factor with long-term predictability for CVD odds ratio, selected apart from age, which is non-modifiable. The lasting effect of BMI on CVD risk remains robust and consistent across different methods and specifications that account for variable selection errors in high-dimensional logit regression and BMI’s time trends. In addition to the long-term predictive role of BMI in CVD risk, the disease burden associated with increased BMI is quantified by comparing the marginal effects of BMI to those of age across various groups. The marginal effect of elevated BMI is more pronounced in men than women and among the employed compared to the non-employed. Leading a healthy lifestyle through the control of BMI is a critical element for preventing CVD based on the empirical findings of the current study."

Induction motor performance degrades over time due to continuous operation, over load, transient unbalanced supply voltage and current. Hence, induction motor performance and efficiency are evaluated through measurement of motor torque. The torque measurement using various sensors such as acoustic, mems-vibration, strain gauge, in line sensors, never provides the inaccurate results due to contact type sensors and improper mounting of sensor on the motor. Moreover, existing methods never provides inaccurate torque measurement for different types of motor duty cycle such as continuous duty, intermittent periodic duties, short-time duty and continuous operation with intermittent load. In this paper, novel non-contact method measures torque with Dual-function ultra-wide band (UWB) (DFR) Radar sensor. DFR acquires polarized signal reflected from air gap of motor magnetic flux. Moreover, air gap magnetic flux radiation through motor ventilator is directly proportional to motor torque. In this paper, motor torque is measured through air gap magnetic flux radiation and DFR sensor. The electromagnetic waves from DFR is reflected by the air gap magnetic flux emitted from motor and the reflected waves are polarized. The reflected DFR sensor signal from air gap magnetic flux has high polarity charge and resonance. From received polarized signal, Instantaneous Frequency (IF) is obtained through Multi-Synchro Squeezing Transform (MSST) algorithm. The motor torque is measured with IF and Gaussian regression algorithm. Torque spikes in Induction motor is analyzed during frequent change in heavy, low load, and induced transient Torque prediction through MSST IF frequency and Gaussian Regression is compared with Torque predicted through different transform such as Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT), Dyadic Wavelet Transform (DyWT). The MSST based torque measurement provides 96% of accuracy, when compared with traditional strain gauge torque measuring instrument. Initial review."

Enhancing feature selection with GMSMFO: A global optimization algorithm for machine learning with application to intrusion detection,2023,"['moth-flame optimization', 'metaheuristic optimization', 'global optimization algorithms', 'intrusion detection systems', 'swarm intelligence']",,"The paper addresses the limitations of the Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO) algorithm, a meta-heuristic used to solve optimization problems. The MFO algorithm, which employs moths' transverse orientation navigation technique, has been used to generate solutions for such problems. However, the performance of MFO is dependent on the flame production and spiral search components, and the search mechanism could still be improved concerning the diversity of flames and the moths' ability to find solutions. The authors propose a revised version called GMSMFO, which uses a Novel Gaussian mutation mechanism and shrink MFO to enhance population diversity and balance exploration and exploitation capabilities. The study evaluates the performance of GMSMFO using the CEC 2017 benchmark and 20 datasets, including a high-dimensional intrusion detection system dataset. The proposed algorithm is compared to other advanced metaheuristics, and its performance is evaluated using statistical tests such as Friedman and Wilcoxon rank-sum. The study shows that GMSMFO is highly competitive and frequently superior to other algorithms. It can identify the ideal feature subset, improving classification accuracy and reducing the number of features used. The main contribution of this research paper includes the improvement of the exploration/exploitation balance and the expansion of the local search. The ranging controller and Gaussian mutation enhance navigation and diversity. The research paper compares GMSMFO with traditional and advanced metaheuristic algorithms on 29 benchmarks and its application to binary feature selection on 20 benchmarks, including intrusion detection systems. The statistical tests (Wilcoxon rank-sum and Friedman) evaluate the performance of GMSMFO compared to other algorithms.

Stress Level Based Emotion Classification Using Hybrid Deep Learning Algorithm,2023,"['Stress analysis', 'Emotion analysis', 'Deep learning', 'Classification', 'Convolutional neural network']",,"The present fast-moving era brings a serious stress issue that affects elders and youngsters. Everyone has undergone stress factors at least once in their lifetime. Stress is more among youngsters as they are new to the working environment. whereas the stress factors for elders affect the individual and overall performance in an organization. Electroencephalogram (EEG) based stress level classification is one of the widely used methodologies for stress detection. However, the signal processing methods evolved so far have limitations as most of the stress classification models compute the stress level in a predefined environment to detect individual stress factors. Specifically, machine learning based stress classification models requires additional algorithm for feature extraction which increases the computation cost. Also due to the limited feature learning characteristics of machine learning algorithms, the classification performance reduces and inaccurate sometimes.

Intelligent Operation Monitoring of an Ultra-Precision CNC Machine Tool Using Energy Data,2023,"['Intelligent operation monitoring', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Energy consumption monitoring']",,"Ultra-precision CNC machine tools play a significant role in the machining of precision dies and molds, optics, consumer electronics, etc., Due to the nature of ultra-precision machining, a subtle change in process condition, machine anomalies, etc. may significantly influence the machining outcome. Hence, continuous monitoring of the equipment’s operation is required to better understand the variations associated with the process and the machine. The conventional monitoring platform requires comprehensive data analysis using multiple sensors, and controller data to detect, diagnose, and prognose machine and process conditions. This increases the cost and complexity of installing a monitoring platform. The energy consumption data contains valuable information that could be potentially used to identify machine and process variations. The information can also be used to develop potential energy-saving strategies in an effort towards Green Manufacturing. This paper proposes an intelligent energy monitoring method using a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to effortlessly and accurately obtain the working status information of the machine with minimal retrofitting. The 1D-CNN uses the energy consumption data to determine the equipment’s operation status by identifying the working components and the feed rate of the moving axis. The hyper-parameters of the developed model were optimized to improve the prediction accuracy. The paper also compares different Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms to gauge their effective performance in this application. Finally, the model with the highest accuracy was validated on a 5-axis ultra-precision CNC machine tool. Results show that 1D-CNN performs better than multi-layer neural networks and machine learning algorithms in processing time-series datasets. The classification accuracy of 1D-CNN on the detection of operation status and feed rate of each axis can reach 95.7 and 91.4%, respectively. Further studies are currently in progress to improve prediction accuracy of the model, and to detect subtle changes in energy consumption which would enable identification of the machine and process anomalies."

Nutrient Defect Detection In Plant Leaf Imaging Analysis Using Incremental Learning Approach With Multifrequency Visible Light Approach,2023,"['Plant', 'Leaf', 'Disease', 'Nutrient', 'Multifrequency', 'Machine learning', 'Intensive learning', 'Incremental learning', 'Image processing', 'Signal analysis']",,"Nutrient deficiency during growth is a major cause of reduced yield for wide variety of plants. Yield can be improved if nutrient levels are regularly checked, and maintained using proper fertilization & pest control. In order to perform this task, a wide variety of image processing systems models have been developed, which aim at analysing plant imagery to look for visually apparent nutrient deficient patterns. But these systems are able to identify nutrient deficiencies after the plant is affected by them. In contrast to this, intrusive systems are developed which perform chemical analysis on leaf samples in order to estimate these deficiencies. Performing such chemical analysis limits their testing capabilities because random leaf samples are taken for evaluation, thereby limiting their accuracy. In order to remove these drawbacks, this text proposes a nonintrusive multifrequency visible light analysis framework, that can be used for identification of multiple nutrient deficiencies for a wide variety of plants. In order to map spatial & temporal light properties with nutrient shortages with high accuracy, this framework leverages extensive learning. In order to authenticate the readings, the framework also processes nonintrusive microscopic photos of the same plant leaf using a deep learning technique. This is accomplished by an incremental learning technique that combines the high-efficiency classification capabilities of the VGGNet19 and XceptionNet models. The model can be used for proactive nutrient monitoring and to conduct corrective actions to improve yield quality because it is nonintrusive. The proposed model was evaluated for potassium, nitrogen, copper, zinc, and phosphorus deficit in orange, cotton, apple, banana, mango, litchi, henna, gooseberry, and okra leaf. It was observed that the proposed approach is able to achieve 99.7% accuracy for detection of potassium, 97.2% for nitrogen, 98.5% for copper, 96.8% for zinc, and 95.9% for detection of phosphorus. This accuracy was evaluated by finding average performance of the model for different leaf types, and was compared with various state-of-the-art models. It was observed that the proposed approach has 8% better accuracy than previously described models, and showcases better precision, recall, and fMeasure performance. Due to intensive learning, the model requires large initial delay of training, but evaluation speed is at par with recent state-of-the-art models."
Detecting balling defects using multisource transfer learning in wire arc additive manufacturing,2023,"['wire arc additive manufacturing', 'anomaly detection', 'transfer learning', 'convolutional neural networks', 'domain adaptation']",,"Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) has gained attention as a feasible process in large-scale metal additive manufacturing due to its high deposition rate, cost efficiency, and material diversity. However, WAAM induces a degree of uncertainty in the process stability and the part quality owing to its non-equilibrium thermal cycles and layer-by-layer stacking mechanism. Anomaly detection is therefore necessary for the quality monitoring of the parts. Most relevant studies have applied machine learning to derive data-driven models that detect defects through feature and pattern learning. However, acquiring sufficient data is time- and/or resource-intensive, which introduces a challenge to applying machine learning-based anomaly detection. This study proposes a multisource transfer learning method that generates anomaly detection models for balling defect detection, thus ensuring quality monitoring in WAAM. The proposed method uses convolutional neural network models to extract sufficient image features from multisource materials, then transfers and fine-tunes the models for anomaly detection in the target material. Stepwise learning is applied to extract image features sequentially from individual source materials, and composite learning is employed to assign the optimal frozen ratio for converging transferred and present features. Experiments were performed using a gas tungsten arc welding-based WAAM process to validate the classification accuracy of the models using low-carbon steel, stainless steel, and Inconel."

This study aims to predict customer purchase conversion at the session-level by employing customer profile, transaction, and clickstream data. For this purpose, we develop a multimodal deep learning fusion model with dynamic and static features (i.e., DS-fusion). Specifically, we base page views within focal visist and recency, frequency, monetary value, and clumpiness (RFMC) for dynamic and static features, respectively, to comprehensively capture customer characteristics for buying behaviors. Our model with deep learning architectures combines these features for conversion prediction. We validate the proposed model using real-world e-commerce data.

To enable quadruped robots to acquire this ability, this study proposes a two-stage training hierarchical framework that can have quadruped robots generate energy-efficient multiple-gait locomotion, consisting of a gait selection policy module and a react controller module. The parameters of both modules are optimized using reinforcement learning. The experimental results in the simulation demonstrate that the proposed method can generate energy-efficient multiple-gait quadrupedal locomotion compared to previous methods. To validate the robustness and effectiveness of the method, we constructed a closed-chain quadruped robot and deployed the controller trained by the method to the robot. The experimental results in the real world suggest that the controller can enable the robot to move stably and efficiently in different gaits. The main contribution of this paper is that the authors propose a novel hierarchical framework, which makes quadruped robots use an optimal gait at a specific speed and smoothly switch to another one after getting a different speed command. These behaviors are automatically produced through simulation training, eliminating the need for the tedious work of designing gaits and modulating controllers. Experimental results showcase that the proposed method has significant advantages compared to previous methods."
Learning-Based Channel Estimation Method with Non-Orthogonal Pilots for Grant-Free Multiple Access in Massive MIMO Systems,2023,"['Massive MIMO', 'Deep learning', 'grant-free access', 'low latency', 'non-orthogonal pilot.']",,"Massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems are efficient technologies that can meet the increasing need for larger user capacities and diverse requirements posed by massive machine-type communications and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLCs). In particular, massive MIMO systems that employ grant-free (GF) multiple access have recently been studied, aiming to effectively satisfy the uplink transmission requirements of URLLCs. However, the conventional approach to channel estimation in MIMO systems relies on orthogonal pilot signals, necessitating inter-device synchronization. This limitation causes challenges in the integration of GF multiple access with massive MIMO, due to the inherent difficulty in achieving device synchronization within GF multiple access. To overcome this limitation, we propose a learning-based channel estimation method in massive MIMO systems using non-orthogonal pilots. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a bit error rate of less than 10-3 for scenarios with 32, 64, and 128 received antennas and 2 devices, as well as scenarios with 128 received antennas and 2 or 3 devices, at signal-to-noise ratio levels above 0 dB. These findings highlight the promising performance of our proposed method."

Safe Reinforcement Learning-based Driving Policy Design for Autonomous Vehicles on Highways,2023,"['Autonomous vehicles', 'collision avoidance', 'decision-making', 'finite state machine', 'safe reinforcement learning.']",,"Safe decision-making strategy of autonomous vehicles (AVs) plays a critical role in avoiding accidents. This study develops a safe reinforcement learning (safe-RL)-based driving policy for AVs on highways. The hierarchical framework is considered for the proposed safe-RL, where an upper layer executes a safe explorationexploitation by modifying the exploring process of the ε-greedy algorithm, and a lower layer utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) approach to establish the safe conditions for state transitions. The proposed safe-RL-based driving policy improves the vehicle’s safe driving ability using a Q-table that stores the values corresponding to each action state. Moreover, owing to the trade-off between the ε-greedy values and safe distance threshold, the simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to other alternative RL approaches, such as the ε-greedy Q-learning (GQL) and decaying ε-greedy Q-learning (DGQL), in an uncertain traffic environment.

Therefore, a preparatory process of verifying awareness and acceptance of FCEV and hydrogen energy through research is necessary. As there are issues about the safety of hydrogen energy due to several explosion accidents, we hypothesized that psychological attitudes to hydrogen energy like risk perception and familiarity would be effect on vehicle purchase behavior. In order to verify hypothesis this study analyzed using logistic regression and decision tree method, a machine learning technique for a preference model among FCEVs. The results show that hydrogen risk has a larger influence than hydrogen familiarity on the choice of FCEVs. In addition, we identified that the variables which are vehicle price, charge price, VKT(Vehicle Kilometers Traveled), distance to the charging station, gender, and age group also affect on vehicle purchase behavior. Using the decision tree algorithm in the AI technique, analysis results for vehicle preference in e-mobility (EVs, hybrid, FCEVs) show that hybrid vehicles select 46%, EVs 31%, FCEVs 23%.

Robust deep learning-based fault detection of planetary gearbox using enhanced health data map under domain shift problem,2023,"['fault detection', 'planetary gearbox', 'domain-shift', 'convolution autoencoder', 'Sobel operator', 'EnHDMap']",,"The conventional deep learning-based fault diagnosis approach faces challenges under the domain shift problem, where the model encounters different working conditions from the ones it was trained on. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the diagnosis of planetary gearboxes due to the complicated vibrations they generate, which can vary significantly based on the system characteristics of the gearbox. To solve this challenge, this paper proposes a robust deep learning-based fault-detection approach for planetary gearboxes by utilizing an enhanced health data map (HDMap). Although there is an HDMap method that visually expresses the vibration signal of the planetary gearbox according to the gear meshing position, it is greatly influenced by machine operating conditions. In this study, domain-specific features from the HDMap are further removed, while the fault-related features are enhanced. Autoencoder-based residual analysis and digital image-processing techniques are employed to address the domain-shift problem. The performance of the proposed method was validated under significant domain-shift problem conditions, as demonstrated by studying two gearbox test rigs with different configurations operated under stationary and non-stationary operating conditions. Validation accuracy was measured in all 12 possible domain-shift scenarios. The proposed method achieved robust fault detection accuracy, outperforming prior methods in most cases."

Recent studies on automatic scoring of essays are developing into studies using deep learning-based algorithms. However when automatic scoring is used in the field of education, deep learning-based algorithms have limitations because the interpretation and explanation of the scoring results must be possible. Therefore, in this study, we tried to develop a model that can interpret the scoring results by applying a machine learning-based algorithm that utilizes scoring features. In the essay, various parts of morpheme-based scoring qualities were derived, and the number of sentences was used. As a result, it was possible to derive a significant level of model performance. However, this study has a limitation in that it utilized basic quantitative feature such as parts of morpheme frequency and number of sentences.

Developing a deep learning-based recommendation model using online reviews for predicting consumer preferences: Evidence from the restaurant industry,2023,"['레스토랑 추천 시스템', '온라인 리뷰', '딥러닝', 'CNN-LSTM', '텍스트 마이닝', 'restaurant recommender system', 'online review', 'deep learning', 'CNN-LSTM', 'text mining']",,"With the growth of the food-catering industry, consumer preferences and the number of dine-in restaurants are gradually increasing. Thus, personalized recommendation services are required to select a restaurant suitable for consumer preferences. Previous studies have used questionnaires and star-rating approaches, which do not effectively depict consumer preferences. Online reviews are the most essential sources of information in this regard. However, previous studies have aggregated online reviews into long documents, and traditional machine-learning methods have been applied to these to extract semantic representations; however, such approaches fail to consider the surrounding word or context. Therefore, this study proposes a novel review textual-based restaurant recommendation model (RT-RRM) that uses deep learning to effectively extract consumer preferences from online reviews. The proposed model concatenates consumer-restaurant interactions with the extracted high-level semantic representations and predicts consumer preferences accurately and effectively. Experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed model exhibits excellent recommendation performance compared with several baseline models."

In this study, we identified seed coat patterns of Allium seeds using five deep learning methods namely, CNN, AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 for the first time. Selected images of seed coat patterns from over 100 Allium species reported in previously published literature and data from our samples were classified into seven types of anticlinal (irregular curved, irregular curved to nearly straight, straight, S, U, UO, and omega) and five types of periclinal walls (granule, small verruca, large verruca, marginal verruca, and verrucate verruca). The results revealed that GoogleNet and VGG16 achieved the highest classifi cation accuracy of 90.4% for the anticlinal wall, and VGG16 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98.1% for the periclinal wall. Moreover, more than three, four, and five methods were combined, and their performance was investigated. Combining more than three methods was the most advantageous. The models achieved a suitable anticlinal wall classification using GoogleNet and periclinal wall classification using VGG16. In conclusion, using the machine-based method, we studied the seed coat of species of Allium on our own samples to see if the results of the machine-based method match with the human based classification."

We propose an achievable scheme that partially adopts the conventional private information retrieval (PIR) scheme that achieves the minimum amount of download. With respect to computation and communication overhead, we compare the achievable scheme with a naïve approach for federated submodel learning with information-theoretic privacy."
Vibration data feature extraction and deep learning-based preprocessing method for highly accurate motor fault diagnosis,2023,"['denoising auto encoder', 'one-class support vector machine', 'prognostics and health management', 'vibration data', 'wavelet transform']",,"The environmental regulations on vessels being strengthened by the International Maritime Organization has led to a steady growth in the eco-friendly ship market. Related research is being actively conducted, including many studies on the maintenance and predictive maintenance of propulsion systems (including electric motors and rotating bodies) in electric propulsion vessels. The present study intends to enhance the artificial intelligence (AI)-based failure-diagnosis rate for electric propulsion vessel propulsion systems. To verify the proposed AI-based failure diagnosis algorithm for electric motors, this study utilized the vibration data of mechanical equipment (electric motors) in an urban railway station. Securing and preprocessing high-quality data is crucial for improving the failure-diagnosis rate, in addition to the performance of the diagnostic algorithm. However, the conventional wavelet transform method, which is generally used for machine signal processing, has a disadvantage of data loss when the data distribution is abnormal or skewed. This study, to overcome this shortcoming, proposes an AI-based denoising auto encoder (DAE) method that can remove noise while maintaining data characteristics for signal processing of mechanical equipment. This study preprocessed vibration data by using the DAE method, and extracted significant features from the data through the feature extraction method. The extracted features were utilized to train the one-class support vector machine model and to allow the model to diagnose the failure. Finally, the F-1 score was calculated by using the failure diagnosis results, and the most meaningful feature extraction method was determined for the vibration data. In addition, this study compared and evaluated the preprocessing performance based on the DAE and the wavelet transform methods."

The data were used to train three models based on BERT, GRU, and LSTM for the categorical classification of disaster tweets. Finally, the three models were evaluated and compared using the test data. BERT achieved an accuracy of 96.2%, making it the most effective model. In contrast, the LSTM and GRU models achieved an accuracy of 93.2% and 88.4%, respectively. These findings underscore the potential effectiveness of deep learning models in classifying disaster-related tweets, offering insights that could enhance disaster management strategies, refine social media monitoring processes, bolster public safety, and provide directions for future research."
Combining Linear and Nonlinear Normalization Methods to Improve Learning Performance in Traffic Scene Recognition,2023,"['Neural Network', 'Normalization Method', 'Linear and Nonlinear Models', 'Traffic Scene Analysis']",,"Although input vector properties are the main determinants of neural network performance, most studies use a simple linear scaling model to normalize the input vector without considering input vector normalization. Because single normalization maps only a single property of the input data, the current normalization approach may not be effective for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, a linear type of normalization is just a linear mapping that mirrors raw data properties. On the other hand, non-linear normalization can reflect non-linearly by emphasizing certain properties. This study aims to propose a new and efficient normalization method that can provide better prediction performance by learning machines. For this purpose, various regularization methods such as linear and nonlinear mapping models and a combination of the two models were considered. The research methodology is as follows. a) Based on theoretical studies on linear and nonlinear models of regularization methods, a method that combines two different normalization methods is proposed. b) Data are prepared for experiments in neural network models. c) Experiments are conducted with the neural network model on two network topologies with three different normalization methods and 30 trials with different initial weights, and the results are obtained. d) The prediction performance is compared, and the best normalization method for traffic scene analysis is suggested. Experimental studies have shown that the prediction performance of the input vector by the nonlinear normalization method is 0.6–2.4% better than the prediction performance of the input vector by the linear method. More importantly, the predictive performance of the combination of the two normalization methods is 2.4–7.2% better than the linear method and 2.8–4.0% better than the non-linear method. The results of this study revealed that the combined use of two different normalization methods provides better performance in machine learning compared to individual normalization methods, such as linear and nonlinear normalization on input vectors."

FedGCD: Federated Learning Algorithm with GNN based Community Detection for Heterogeneous Data,2023,"['Federated Learning', 'Non-IID', 'data heterogeneity', 'Community Detection', 'Graph Neural Networks']",,"Federated learning (FL) is a ground breaking machine learning paradigm that allow smultiple participants to collaboratively train models in a cloud environment, all while maintaining the privacy of their raw data. This approach is in valuable in applications involving sensitive or geographically distributed data. However, one of the challenges in FL is dealing with heterogeneous and non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across participants, which can result in suboptimal model performance compared to traditionalmachine learning methods. To tackle this, we introduce FedGCD, a novel FL algorithm that employs Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based community detection to enhance model convergence in federated settings. In our experiments, FedGCD consistently outperformed existing FL algorithms in various scenarios: for instance, in a non-IID environment, it achieved an accuracy of 0.9113, a precision of 0.8798,and an F1-Score of 0.8972. In a semi-IID setting, it demonstrated the highest accuracy at 0.9315 and an impressive F1-Score of 0.9312. We also introduce a new metric, nonIIDness, to quantitatively measure the degree of data heterogeneity. Our results indicate that FedGCD not only addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity and non-IIDness but also sets new benchmarks for FL algorithms. The community detection approach adopted in FedGCD has broader implications, suggesting that it could be adapted for other distributed machine learning scenarios, thereby improving model performance and convergence across a range of applications."

During the various operations, the dumper operators are subjected to whole-body vibrations (WBV) which also affects their physiological factors. The present study investigates the dumper operator discomfort during various dumper operations such as material-loading (ML), loaded-travel (LT), material-unloading (MU) and unloaded-travel (UT). As per ISO 2631:1 specified, limit during the ML and MU task, the measured crest factor value is greater than the recommended values. However, the measured aw(8) and VDV(8) magnitude are within the specified limit. In the LT, it is observed that the VDV is within the limit, although the measured value is 1.39 times greater than MU task. The maximum WBV is observed during the UT, and the measured value of VDV falls above the specified limit, and experience a greater amplification of source vibration at 1.6 Hz. Moreover, the demand for high number of operation cycle increases the risk of neck pain and back pain among the study population. Operator physiological stress under WBV exposure showed a significant increase in heart rate by 2.04 bpm. Whereas, no significant influence on the increase in blood pressure (SYS/DIA: 1.56/0.76 mmHg) and a decrease in oxygen saturation level (SpO2) by 1% was observed. Therefore, to optimize the performance of seat design under different operation cycle using computational learning technique support vector machine classifier with quadratic preset model provides a best accuracy of 98.5% over the other machine learning algorithm. The study reveals that the prolonged sitting and constant experience of WBV could increase the job work stress, the computational learning technique warranted to prevent the operator from high WBV exposures."

The two traditional machine learning models, SVM and RF, lower up to 11% in overall accuracy and 0.15 for Kappa coefficient values. We also estimated the surface area of water based on the best classification results and found that the changes in water surface area were correlated with the monthly precipitation with a coefficient correlation of 0.89. This study should give new insight into the classification method for high-resolution satellite images.

In this study, however, we designed a BMI system that uses sensory-related neural signals for BMI combined with electrical stimulation for reward. Four-channel electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals were recorded from the whisker-related somatosensory cortex of rats and converted to extract the BMI signals to control the one-dimensional movement of a dot on the screen. At the same time, we used operant conditioning with electrical stimulation on medial forebrain bundle (MFB), which provides a virtual reward to motivate the rat to move the dot towards the desired center region. The BMI task training was performed for 7 days with ECoG recording and MFB stimulation. Animals successfully learned to move the dot location to the desired position using S1BF neural activity. This study successfully demonstrated that it is feasible to utilize the neural signals from the whisker somatosensory cortex for BMI system. In addition, the MFB electrical stimulation is effective for rats to learn the behavioral task for BMI."

For this purpose, a federated learning (FL) method based on the Observational MedicalOutcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) was implemented, and its feasibility was demonstrated.Methods: We implemented an FL platform on FeederNet, which is a distributed clinical data analysis platform based on theOMOP CDM in Korea. We trained it through an artificial neural network (ANN) using data from patients who received steroidprescriptions or injections, with the aim of predicting the occurrence of side effects depending on the prescribed dose.The ANN was trained using the FL platform with the OMOP CDMs of Kyung Hee University Medical Center (KHMC) andAjou University Hospital (AUH). Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) for predictingbone fracture, osteonecrosis, and osteoporosis using only data from each hospital were 0.8426, 0.6920, and 0.7727 forKHMC and 0.7891, 0.7049, and 0.7544 for AUH, respectively. In contrast, when using FL, the corresponding AUROCs were0.8260, 0.7001, and 0.7928 for KHMC and 0.7912, 0.8076, and 0.7441 for AUH, respectively. In particular, FL led to a 14%improvement in performance for osteonecrosis at AUH. Conclusions: FL can be performed with the OMOP CDM, and FLoften shows better performance than using only a single institution's data. Therefore, research using OMOP CDM has beenexpanded from statistical analysis to machine learning so that researchers can conduct more diverse research."
Deep Learning Approach for Automatic Discontinuity Mapping on  3D Model of Tunnel Face,2023,"['3D Tunnel face', 'Rock discontinuity', 'Deep learning', '3차원 터널 막장', '암반 불연속면 분류', '딥러닝 영역분할']",,"This paper presents a new approach for the automatic mapping of discontinuities in a tunnel face based on its 3D digital model reconstructed by LiDAR scan or photogrammetry tech- niques. The main idea revolves around the identification of discontinuity areas in the 3D digital model of a tunnel face by segmenting its 2D projected images using a deep-learning semantic segmentation model called U-Net. The proposed deep learning model integrates various features including the projected RGB image, depth map image, and local surface properties-based images i.e., normal vector and curvature images to effectively segment areas of discontinuity in the images. Subsequently, the segmentation results are projected back onto the 3D model using depth maps and projection matrices to obtain an accurate repre- sentation of the location and extent of discontinuities within the 3D space. The performance of the segmentation model is evaluated by comparing the segmented results with their corresponding ground truths, which demonstrates the high accuracy of segmentation results with the intersection-over-union metric of approximately 0.8. Despite still being limited in training data, this method exhibits promising potential to address the limitations of conven- tional approaches, which only rely on normal vectors and unsupervised machine learning algorithms for grouping points in the 3D model into distinct sets of discontinuities."
Analysis of Passives in English-to-Korean Machine Translation Systems’ Output,2023,"['AI', 'machine translation', 'passive', '인공지능', '기계번역', '수동구문율']",,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools for teaching and learning English as a foreign language have become increasingly functional, leading to the growing use of AI translators and chatbots in fields of English education and research. This study investigated the potential of English-to-Korean machine translators (MTs) as media of interactive language learning to support Korean EFL learners’ reading comprehension development. Using translation data from research articles on English passives involving NP movement, this study evaluated how well two popular MTs could translate English passive sentences into Korean. This study analyzed MTs’ output in two ways: (i) whether the product’s meaning was accurate, and (ii) what type of Korean passive the product was. First, it calculated rates of semantically accurate and grammatically appropriate translations, both actives and passives produced by the two MTs. Second, it calculated rates of three different types of Korean passives produced by MTs. Results demonstrated that currently available English-to-Korean MTs could produce semantically correct translations at high rates in the form of Korean passives. Active voice constructions also showed significant rates. These findings suggest that MTs have strong potential as tools for English reading pedagogy."
AutoFe-Sel: A Meta-learning based methodology for Recommending Feature Subset Selection Algorithms,2023,"['Algorithm selection', 'Feature selection', 'Recommender systems', 'Meta-learning']",,"Automated machine learning, often referred to as ""AutoML,"" is the process of automating the time-consuming and iterative procedures that are associated with the building of machine learning models. There have been significant contributions in this area across a number of different stages of accomplishing a data-mining task, including model selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and preprocessing method selection. Among them, preprocessing method selection is a relatively new and fast growing research area. The current work is focused on the recommendation of preprocessing methods, i.e., feature subset selection (FSS) algorithms. One limitation in the existing studies regarding FSS algorithm recommendation is the use of a single learner for meta-modeling, which restricts its capabilities in the meta-modeling. Moreover, the meta-modeling in the existing studies is typically based on a single group of data characterization measures (DCMs). Nonetheless, there are a number of complementary DCM groups, and their combination will allow them to leverage their diversity, resulting in improved meta-modeling. This study aims to address these limitations by proposing an architecture for preprocess method selection that uses ensemble learning for meta-modeling, namely AutoFE-Sel. To evaluate the proposed method, we performed an extensive experimental evaluation involving 8 FSS algorithms, 3 groups of DCMs, and 125 datasets. Results show that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to three baseline methods. The proposed architecture can also be easily extended to other preprocessing method selections, e.g., noise-filter selection and imbalance handling method selection."
Identifying Disease of Interest With Deep Learning Using Diagnosis Code,2023,"['Deep Learning', 'Gastric Cancer', 'Machine Learning', 'Prediction', 'Diagnosis Code']",,"Background: Autoencoder (AE) is one of the deep learning techniques that uses an artificial neural network to reconstruct its input data in the output layer. We constructed a novel supervised AE model and tested its performance in the prediction of a co-existence of the disease of interest only using diagnostic codes.Methods: Diagnostic codes of one million randomly sampled patients listed in the Korean National Health Information Database in 2019 were used to train, validate, and test the prediction model. The first used AE solely for a feature engineering tool for an input of a classifier. Supervised Multi-Layer Perceptron (sMLP) was added to train a classifier to predict a binary level with latent representation as an input (AE + sMLP). The second model simultaneously updated the parameters in the AE and the connected MLP classifier during the learning process (End-to-End Supervised AE [EEsAE]). We tested the performances of these two models against baseline models, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and naïve Bayes, in the prediction of co-existing gastric cancer diagnosis.Results: The proposed EEsAE model yielded the highest F1-score and highest area under the curve (0.86). The EEsAE and AE + sMLP gave the highest recalls. XGB yielded the highest precision. Ablation study revealed that iron deficiency anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, essential hypertension, gastric ulcers, benign prostate hyperplasia, and shoulder lesion were the top 6 most influential diagnoses on performance.Conclusion: A novel EEsAE model showed promising performance in the prediction of a disease of interest."

Artificial intelligence facilitates the automation of many processes and speed up work. Determining the existence of a defect, its location, size and type are the main tasks solved by nondestructive testing, particularly phased array ultrasonic testing. In this study, deep learning methods were used to determine the existence of defects, and their sizes. Unfortunately, because of the small amount of data, it is impossible to train the neural network to recognize the type of defect. Three neural networks were developed and pretrained to determine the existence of defects. The results of the developed neural networks were compared with those of the TensorFlow library models pretrained using the ImageNet dataset. The developed neural networks show similar performance as the pretrained TensorFlow neural networks."
Physics-informed neural networks for learning fluid flows with symmetry,2023,"['Physics-informed Machine Learning', 'Network Architecture', 'Power-law Fluid', 'Pressure-driven Flow', 'Inverse Problem']",,"We suggest symmetric variational physics-informed neural networks (symmetric VPINN) to learn the symmetric fluid flow and physical properties of fluids from a limited set of data. Symmetric VPINN is based on the VPINN framework and guarantees the symmetry of the solutions by modifying the network architecture. The effectiveness of the symmetric VPINN is demonstrated by predicting the velocity profiles and power-law fluid properties in the Poiseuille flow of a parallel channel. Symmetric VPINN models robustly and accurately learn power-law fluid flow in both forward and inverse problems. We demonstrate that the symmetric VPINN can be particularly useful when the power-law index is small and the data are extremely limited. The modified network architecture in the symmetric VPINN guides the neural network towards an exact solution by reinforcing symmetry. We show that symmetric VPINN is effective in obtaining unknown physical properties in practical experiments where data are scarce, suggesting the possibility of introducing known conditions of the system directly into the network structure to improve the accuracy of the network."
Explainable Boosting Machine for Predicting Wind Shear-Induced Aircraft Go-around Based on Pilot Reports,2023,"['Civil aviation safety', 'Go-around', 'Machine learning', 'Explainable boosting machine']",,"The go-around is a safety-critical procedure in civil aviation that is rarely executed but is essential to avoid risky landings. Analyzing the factors that trigger go-around events can aid in identifying measures that could lower their frequency. This involves circumstances that could be deemed abnormal and intrinsically harmful. The study employed the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a contemporary transparent model, to predict aircraft go-arounds and interpret different influential factors. The model proposed exhibits comparable accuracy to black-box models. The study utilized pilot reports and applied SMOTE-ENN to address the imbalance problem. The EBM model was trained with treated data in conjunction with Bayesian optimization. The EBM model's performance was evaluated using holdout data and compared to binary logistic regression and decision tree models, as well as black-box models such as adaptive boosting, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. The EBM model exhibited superior performance compared to other models in terms of precision (83.15%), recall (79.77%), geometric mean (77.29%), and Matthews’s correlation coefficient (0.453). The EBM algorithm enables the comprehensive interpretation of individual and pairwise factor interactions in predicting aircraft go-around outcomes from both global and local perspectives.

ECBFMBP: Design of an Ensemble deep learning Classifier with Bio-inspired Feature Selection for high-efficiency Multidomain Bug Prediction,2023,"['Bug', 'prediction', 'machine', 'learning', 'ensemble', 'GWO']",,"Prediction of software bugs from process logs, temporal access logs, behavior analysis, etc. requires estimation of a wide variety of high-density feature sets. Extracted feature sets must be able to classify these logs into different bug categories with high accuracy, and low complexity. To perform these tasks, a wide variety of Machine Learning Models (MLMs) are proposed by researchers, and each of them varies in terms of their performance-level nuances, functional advantages, contextual limitations, and application-specific future scopes. Upon analyzing these characteristics, it was observed that existing models are highly context-specific, and cannot be applied to multidomain bug analysis datasets. Moreover, existing models do not incorporate a dynamic feature selection method, which limits their accuracy performance under multiple bug classification applications. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes design of a novel Ensemble deep learning Classifier with Feature Selection for high-efficiency Multidomain Bug Prediction under different use cases. The proposed model improves bug representation performance by combining multiple feature extraction methods, including GWO-based novel feature selection techniques. The ensemble classification model, which combines Deep Random Forest, k Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, and 1D Convolutional Neural Network classifiers, achieves higher accuracy, precision, recall, and low delay compared to existing models. The model also shows faster classification speeds than existing models and can be deployed for various real-time applications. This accuracy performance was compared with various state-of-the-art models, and it was observed that the proposed model showcases 4.5% higher accuracy, 3.2% better precision, 3.9% higher recall, and 5.5% faster classification performance, which was possible due to integration of intelligent feature selection process with high efficiency classification models under multidomain scenarios."
"Sound-Based Abnormal Combustion Classification Model for High Compression Ratio, Spark-Ignition Engines Using Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients and Ensemble Learning Algorithms",2023,"['Engine knock', 'Supervised learning', 'Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients', 'Ensemble learning']",,"A supervised machine learning model was developed to determine knocking in a spark ignition engine. The engine sound was delivered to an operator via an extended metal tube installed on the cylinder block. The sound was recorded using a smartphone at a sample frequency of 48,000 Hz. Thirty-nine features were extracted from the mel-frequency cepstrum and spectral analysis. Neighborhood component analysis was performed to select eight features with the highest contributions. The gentle adaptive boosting scheme, available in MATLAB, achieved the best results among the nine ensemble algorithms used in this study, regardless of whether it was trained using all 39 features or the eight selected features. The best model exhibited 99.98 % accuracy in classifying knock sounds and 99.85 % in classifying normal sounds. A second round of validation was performed to investigate the robustness of the proposed model. The dataset used in this round was acquired from a slightly advanced spark timing case, in which knock intensity varied from mild to severe. The model achieved 100 % accuracy in detecting both knock and normal sounds. Each signal segment contained an individual cycle sound to evaluate the feasibility of a model for detecting individual knock cycles during real-time engine sound monitoring."
Ensemble Deep Learning Model using Random Forest for Patient Shock Detection,2023,"['Digital healthcare', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Random forest', 'MAP', 'Shock patient']",,"Digital healthcare combined with telemedicine services in the form of convergence with digital technology and AI is developing rapidly. Digital healthcare research is being conducted on many conditions including shock. However, the causes of shock are diverse, and the treatment is very complicated, requiring a high level of medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose a shock detection method based on the correlation between shock and data extracted from hemodynamic monitoring equipment. From the various parameters expressed by this equipment, four parameters closely related to patient shock were used as the input data for a machine learning model in order to detect the shock. Using the four parameters as input data, that is, feature values, a random forest-based ensemble machine learning model was constructed. The value of the mean arterial pressure was used as the correct answer value, the so called label value, to detect the patient’s shock state. The performance was then compared with the decision tree and logistic regression model using a confusion matrix. The average accuracy of the random forest model was 92.80%, which shows superior performance compared to other models. We look forward to our work playing a role in helping medical staff by making recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of complex and difficult cases of shock."
Research on prediction and analysis of supercritical water heat transfer coefficient based on support vector machine,2023,"['Supercritical water', 'Support vector machine', 'Radial basis kernel function', 'Data normalization', 'Heat transfer coefficient', 'Machine learning algorithm']",,"In order to better perform thermal hydraulic calculation and analysis of supercritical water reactor, based on the experimental data of supercritical water, the model training and predictive analysis of the heat transfer coefficient of supercritical water were carried out by using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The changes in the prediction accuracy of the supercritical water heat transfer coefficient are analyzed by the changes of the regularization penalty parameter C, the slack variable epsilon and the Gaussian kernel function parameter gamma. The predicted value of the SVM model obtained after parameter optimization and the actual experimental test data are analyzed for data verification. The research results show that: the normalization of the data has a great influence on the prediction results. The slack variable has a relatively small influence on the accuracy change range of the predicted heat transfer coefficient. The change of gamma has the greatest impact on the accuracy of the heat transfer coefficient. Compared with the calculation results of traditional empirical formula methods, the trained algorithm model using SVM has smaller average error and standard deviations. Using the SVM trained algorithm model, the heat transfer coefficient of supercritical water can be effectively predicted and analyzed."
PartitionTuner: An operator scheduler for deep-learning compilers supporting multiple heterogeneous processing units,2023,"['deep neural network', 'deep-learning compiler', 'parallel processing', 'partitioning']",,"Recently, embedded systems, such as mobile platforms, have multiple processing units that can operate in parallel, such as centralized processing units (CPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs). We can use deep-learning compilers to generate machine code optimized for these embedded systems from a deep neural network (DNN). However, the deep-learning compilers proposed so far generate codes that sequentially execute DNN operators on a single processing unit or parallel codes for graphic processing units (GPUs). In this study, we propose PartitionTuner, an operator scheduler for deep-learning compilers that supports multiple heterogeneous PUs including CPUs and NPUs. PartitionTuner can generate an operator-scheduling plan that uses all available PUs simultaneously to minimize overall DNN inference time. Operator scheduling is based on the analysis of DNN architecture and the performance profiles of individual and group operators measured on heterogeneous processing units. By the experiments for seven DNNs, PartitionTuner generates scheduling plans that perform 5.03% better than a static type-based operator-scheduling technique for SqueezeNet. In addition, PartitionTuner outperforms recent profiling-based operator-scheduling techniques for ResNet50, ResNet18, and SqueezeNet by 7.18%, 5.36%, and 2.73%, respectively."
Long Short-Term Memory-Based Deep Learning Models for Screening Parkinson’s Disease Using Sequential Diagnostic Codes,2023,"['Parkinson’s disease', 'deep learning', 'long short-term memory', 'medical-claims data', 'diagnostic code.']",,"Background and Purpose It is challenging to detect Parkinson’s disease (PD) in its early stages, which has prompted researchers to develop techniques based on machine learning methods for detecting PD. However, previous studies did not fully incorporate the slow progression of PD over a long period of time nor consider that its symptoms occur in a time-sequential manner. Contributing to the literature on PD, which has relied heavily on cross-sectional data, this study aimed to develop a method for detecting PD early that can process time-series information using the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm.Methods We sampled 926 patients with PD and 9,260 subjects without PD using medicalclaims data. The LSTM algorithm was tested using diagnostic histories, which contained the diagnostic codes and their respective time information. We compared the prediction power of the 12-month diagnostic codes under two different settings over the 4 years prior to the first PD diagnosis.Results The model that was trained using the most-recent 12-month diagnostic codes had the best performance, with an accuracy of 94.25%, a sensitivity of 82.91%, and a specificity of 95.26%. The other three models (12-month codes from 2, 3, and 4 years prior) were found to have comparable performances, with accuracies of 92.27%, 91.86%, and 91.81%, respectively.The areas under the curve from our data settings ranged from 0.839 to 0.923.Conclusions We explored the possibility that PD specialists could benefit from our proposed machine learning method as an early detection method for PD."
ESL Learners’ Readiness to Use Machine Translation: A Case of a Beginning College English Writing Class,2023,"['Second Language Instruction', 'Machine Translation', 'Second Language Writing Instruction', 'the Integration of Machine Translation into Second Language Instruction']",,"Recently billions of people in every corner of the world have relied on machine translation(MT) to meet their foreign language needs. The language classroom is not an exception for this phenomenon. However, if we hope to help our students improve their language skills with it, they should be able to detect errors it produces and revise them accurately. In this light, this study explores whether Korean college students are ready to benefit from it for their language development and communication. In the study, eighteen students in a college basic writing class were asked to produce Korean narrative texts and translate the texts into English using MT. Then, they were asked to detect and correct errors in the MT output. The analysis of the MT output manifests its low accuracy and various error types. Further, the analysis of the students' revision works reveals that many students' abilities to both detect and correct errors in the output are limited and that the revision of longer sentence parts tend to be unsuccessful. The study suggests that, despite the results of the study, since its benefits for the learning are too great to be ignored, foreign language teaching professionals should find a way to integrate it to the instruction optimally."
Korean Text to Gloss: Self-Supervised Learning approach,2023,"['Sign Language Production', 'Neural Machine Translation', 'Korean Corpus']",,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) has grown tremendously in recent years. Typically, bilingual, and multilingual translation models have been deployed widely in machine translation and gained vast attention from the research community. On the contrary, few studies have focused on translating between spoken and sign languages, especially non-English languages. Prior works on Sign Language Translation (SLT) have shown that a mid-level sign gloss representation enhances translation performance. Therefore, this study presents a new large-scale Korean sign language dataset, the Museum-Commentary Korean Sign Gloss (MCKSG) dataset, including 3828 pairs of Korean sentences and their corresponding sign glosses used in Museum-Commentary contexts. In addition, we propose a translation framework based on self-supervised learning, where the pretext task is a text-to-text from a Korean sentence to its back-translation versions, then the pre-trained network will be fine-tuned on the MCKSG dataset. Using self-supervised learning help to overcome the drawback of a shortage of sign language data. Through experimental results, our proposed model outperforms a baseline BERT model by 6.22%."
Soft sensor development based on just-in-time learning and dynamic time warping for multi-grade processes,2023,"['Just-in-Time Learning (JITL)', 'Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)', 'Soft Sensor', 'Multi-Grade Process', 'Machine Learning']",,"This study presents the development of soft sensors based on just-in-time learning (JITL) and dynamic time warping (DTW) for online quality prediction in multi-grade processes. Most industrial chemical processes are multi-grade processes that produce multiple products with distinct properties. Multi-grade processes, however, are difficult to monitor and control due to frequent process transitions and abrupt changes in operating conditions. The DTW-based JITL soft sensor modeling approach is proposed as a solution to the complexity of multi-grade process modeling. In the JITL modeling approach, a local model is trained online using historical samples that are similar to the query sample, allowing the model to account for multi-grade characteristics and process drifts. To account for process dynamics and temporal correlations, the suggested approach utilizes a data sequence as an input rather than a single data point. DTW calculates the similarity of data sequences by stretching the sequences to determine an optimal warping path. Additionally, sensitivity analyses of model hyperparameters are performed and a cross-correlation-based hyperparameter optimization approach is proposed. The advantages of the proposed approach are verified via multi-grade simulation studies. As a result, the proposed model outperforms a conventional JITL model based on the Euclidean distance."

Ensemble Learning Model for Classification of Respiratory Anomalies,2023,"['Ensemble model', 'CNN model', 'Classification', 'Respiratory Symptoms']",,"Machine learning methods for classifying respiratory anomalies have provided low classification accuracy. So high classification accuracy is required in order to utilize respiratory sound for classification of respiratory anomalies. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based ensemble model to improve accuracy in classifying respiratory anomaly level into normal, crackle, wheeze, and crackle + wheeze using respiratory sound data. We present three CNN models, each based on each of the three image forms: mel-frequency cepstral coefficient, waveform, or scalogram images. Each model demonstrates higher classification accuracies only for certain types of anomalies. The proposed ensemble model combines the three models to present a single model to classify all four types of respiratory anomalies with high accuracy; the competitive performance of the model is determined using the International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (ICBHI) score. The classification accuracy and ICBHI score are compared with AI models in previous studies to validate the proposed model.

Eventually, a design of the appropriate reward function governing the ultimate results was presented. Compared with traditional velocity planning, the proposed method can decline moving error by 0.05 degrees under the considerations involving dynamic factors in a robotic arm. Besides, the proposed velocity planning strategy could be obtained after taking the training time of one hour which can meet the demand for the time cost of the industry."

A thermal deformation estimation method for high precision machine tool spindles based on the convolutional neural network,2023,['· Spindle thermal displacement · Convolutional neural network · Design of experiments · Multiple regression analysis · Back propagation neural network'],,The temperature rise of key internal components and ambient temperature changes during machining processes are the main causes of thermal displacement in machine tool spindle. This wastes materials and reduces working efficiency. A highly accurate and robust thermal spindle displacement estimation scheme is proposed in this paper which is based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) technique. Several key signals of specific dimensions related to spindle thermal displacement were first collected as two-dimensional (2D) signal maps. A multi-level feature expression for these 2D signal maps was extracted using convolution and pooling. A relationship between the extracted features and spindle thermal displacement was then learned using the neural architecture of the full connection layer. Optimized hyperparameter settings were determined by design of experiments (DoE) applied to the proposed CNN model. Experimental results showed that the proposed method had better performance than the multiple regression analysis (MLR) or back propagation neural network (BPNN) methods in terms of estimation accuracy and robustness at different spindle speeds.

And by analyzing the model evaluation and the experience of science teachers qualitatively, it was attempted to confirm the effectiveness of the program and the perception of science teachers about the application of machine learning to science classes.Methods  For 31 elementary and middle school science teachers enrolled in the Graduate School of Education at the College of Education located in the central region, a total of three matter classification activities were performed and a decision tree algorithm was applied to the machine learning model. And the effectiveness of the program was confirmed through model performance evaluation such as accuracy and F1-score. In addition, we qualitatively analyzed the thoughts of science teachers on the application of machine learning.Results  TAs a result of evaluating the performance of the built model during a total of 3 state of matter classification activities, it was determined that the accuracy and F1-score values increased statically, resulting in the educational effect of the Machine Learning-Based Teacher Education Program on the Classifying State of Matter. And as a result of analyzing the data of the study participants, it was revealed that there are cases in which the states of matter are classified through a deductive thinking process based on knowledge. As a result of comparing evaluation indicators of the machine learning models, the macroscopic classification criteria had a greater effect than the microscopic classification criteria. And when the classification results between the machine learning model and the research participants for various examples were compared, in the case of mixtures, the degree of inconsistency increased. In addition, through qualitative research analysis, the thoughts of science teachers on the application of machine learning were derived into nine topics, including ‘experience the process of creating science concepts’, ‘cognitive conflict’, and ‘communication’.Conclusions  Machine learning should be actively introduced into teacher education as an inquiry-learning method of science education. And educational materials such as textbooks that can properly reflect scientific reasoning processes such as inductive thinking should be developed based on machine learning-based education programs. And it is necessary to discuss from a scientific point of view whether mixtures should be included in the learning of Classifying State of Matter."

Since the 21st century, deep learning has been announced, and unsupervised learning methods have become possible. Artificial intelligence is already demonstrating its ability to exceed human levels in some fields, and with the recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence, it presents various possibilities in the creative field, and the public's interest and trust in it are greatly increasing. am. In this way, the possibility of using artificial intelligence and how to apply it are being discussed in various fields, and a favorable approach to artificial intelligence is being made in the industrial aspect in the field of trade.What is needed to implement this artificial intelligence is machine learning and big data, which trains computers to learn from data and improve through experience, instead of explicitly programming computers as in the traditional way. Subcomponents of machine learning include deep learning and neural networks. In machine learning, algorithms find patterns and correlations in large-scale data sets and make optimal decisions and predictions based on analysis. At this time, big data is the learning material necessary for learning machine learning. Therefore, for artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data are essential and complementary to each other.However, research on machine learning in the field of trade management has not yet been activated, and although some studies are being conducted, its scope and application are still insufficient. Therefore, in this study, through previous research on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, we analyzed the existing research trends on artificial intelligence, and suggested ways to activate machine learning in the field of trade management and policy proposals to improve our understanding of this field. I would like to contribute to follow-up research."

The issue is whether one can be exempted from copyright infringement.In this regard, Korean scholar’s attitude starts from the optimistic perspective that U.S. courts will view AI TDM or AI machine learning as fair use based on the fair use principle.Nevertheless, there is no direct basis for the claim that US courts will exempt AI TDM or AI machine learning from fair use. This is because there has been no case in the United States where a court has recognized fair use by clearly targeting AI TDM or AI machine learning. Meanwhile, The Internet Archive case and the Andy Warhol case are hesitant to expand the fair use principle and are giving rise to pessimistic views on whether the use of other people’s copyrighted works in the AI TDM or AI machine learning process will be considered fair use.Taking that into consideration, American scholars are also developing the argument that the use of copyrighted works for AI machine learning or AI TDM should be considered fair use.Therefore, the positive stance on the possibility of TDM exemption under Article 35-5 of the Korean Copyright Act needs to be carefully reexamined."

In particular, many researchers have tried to predict the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in inland water, which pose a threat to human health and aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, the objective of this study were to: 1) review studies on the application of machine learning models for predicting the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms and its metabolites and 2) prospect for future study on the prediction of cyanobacteria by machine learning models including deep learning. In this study, a systematic literature search and review were conducted using SCOPUS, which is Elsevier’s abstract and citation database. The key results showed that deep learning models were usually used to predict cyanobacterial cells, while machine learning models focused on predicting cyanobacterial metabolites such as concentrations of microcystin, geosmin, and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) in reservoirs. There was a distinct difference in the use of input variables to predict cyanobacterial cells and metabolites. The application of deep learning models through the construction of big data may be encouraged to build accurate models to predict cyanobacterial metabolites."

Overall, the model that predicted future corporate value, including ESG rating information, performed better than the model that predicted future corporate value without including ESG rating information. These results mean that ESG rating information has a significant impact on predicting future corporate value. In other words, the empirical analysis results of this paper mean that corporate ESG activities are an important factor in improving corporate value in the long run.This suggests that companies need to actively engage in ESG activities for sustainable growth and development. The contributions of this study are as follows. In this study, a model for predicting Tobin's Q, a company's future value indicator, was designed by referring to previous studies in the financial and accounting sectors, and research methods on machine learning analysis were designed by referring to previous studies in the MIS field. Most of the papers previously studied on corporate value in the financial and accounting fields have been studied only through regression analysis models, as few attempts have been made to adhere to the research methodology through regression analysis and introduce other research methods.

Therefore, this study aims to develop a corporate financial performance prediction model using machine learning techniques to differentiate it from existing methods.· Differences from prior research: Most previous ESG studies have shown that ESG activities have a significant impact on financial performance using regression analysis models.

For the study, we used corporate financial information and credit rating information from Nice Information Service co., Ltd. data. We extracted 22 financial indicators from 5,705 companies and used them as independent variables, and redefined the definition of default by dividing it into Korean corporate credit ratings, and used them as dependent variables to conduct experimental research using XG BOOST algorithms in Wise Profit's automated machine learning platform. The training and validation ratio of the machine learning algorithm was 7:3, and the experimental results were measured by the error matrix. The experiments were divided into two parts. The first experiment evaluated the performance of the machine learning model trained on the data of each default override. The results of the first experiment showed that the AUROC value increased (0.5 → 0.831) as the data imbalance ratio was reduced by redefining the outlier classification criteria. The second experiment compared the performance of each model created in the first experiment using the same balanced data generated from actual defaults. The results of the second experiment showed that the model trained with the data that resolved the imbalance through outlier redefinition performed better than the model trained with the original data without redefinition."

For this purpose, data corresponding to the health-related data variables provided by the smartwatch were selected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey published annually by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. Data from 11,469 people from the 2016-2018 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used as analysis data. The target variable included the presence or absence of hypertension, and the independent variables included sex, gender, age, pulse rate in 15 seconds, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, body mass index, physical activity (exercise), drinking status, smoking status, and sleep time. First, we divide the entire data set into training data set (70%) and testing data set(30%), and then classify hypertensive diseases using three machine learning classification models (logistic regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine) in the training data set. We checked how accurately the models made predictions on a given test data set. As a result of calculating the performance evaluation index among the three machine learning classification models, the support vector machine showed the best performance. Next, we examined the importance of independent variables under the support vector machine model. Age was the  highest, systolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and body mass index were in the upper range, and drinking status was in the lowest Finally, as age is derived as the most important risk factor for developing hypertension, the importance of variables by age was analyzed for those in their 60s and older. As a result, while there were factors that had the same importance for each age group in the elderly, there were factors that showed differences. Typically, body mass index and fasting blood sugar were the most important factors in all older age groups, and physical activity (exercise) differed by age group. This study is significant in that smartwatch users can predict the prevalence of hypertension with their health-related data by analyzing various factors that can affect hypertension using data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey of large population groups that can represent the Korean population."

In this case, the rest of the ink cannot be reused and is discarded, adversely affecting the company's productivity and environment. Nowadays, machine learning models can be used to figure out this problem. This study compares the ink usage prediction machine learning models. A simple linear regression model, Multiple Regression Analysis, cannot reflect the nonlinear relationship between the variables required for packaging printing, so there is a limit to accurately predicting the amount of ink needed. This study has established various prediction models which are based on CART (Classification and Regression Tree), such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, and XGBoost. The accuracy of the models is determined by the K-fold cross-validation. Error metrics such as root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared are employed to evaluate estimation models' correctness.

Methods To achieve the purpose of this study, a pitcher from the LG Twins team of the Korean professional baseball league was selected, and 13,000 pitches from the 2019~2023 season were collected. The collected data is not secondary data aggregated by year or game, but raw data corresponding to each pitch. The algorithm for developing is the XGBoost, which is an ensemble learning algorithm based on decision trees. A total of four AI models were developed by adjusting the input variables. The prediction results were set to output the predicted probability value for the pitch type. Result The accuracy of the first AI model with the pitch situation information and the pitch information as input variables was 93.04%. The accuracy of the second AI model with only the pitch situation information as input variables was 55.04%. The accuracy of the AI model modeled with the pitch situation information and the information of the pitch thrown immediately before the pitch as input variables was 61.30%. The accuracy of the fourth AI model with the pitch situation information and the information of the pitch thrown immediately before the pitch and the pitch thrown before that was 70.45%. Conclusion The four AI models in this study are divided into two major categories, depending on whether the pitch information is input. In fact, the model developed based on the values of the pitch speed and strike zone of the actual pitch had very good prediction performance. However, from the perspective of forecasting and utilizing game analysis, inputting pitch information can be relatively low in terms of feasibility in the field of real-time forecasting or practical use. The results of this study can provide basic data for the development of a real-time pitch prediction system"

For VPD prediction, the correlation between the environmental elements in and outside the greenhouse and the temporal elements of the time series data was confirmed, and how the highly correlated elements affect VPD was confirmed. Before analyzing the performance of the prediction model, the amount and interval of analysis time series data (1 day, 3 days, 7 days) and interval (20 minutes, 1 hour) were checked to adjust the amount and interval of data. Finally, four machine learning prediction models (XGB Regressor, LGBM Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, etc.) were applied to compare the prediction performance by model. As a result of the prediction of the model, when data of 1 day at 20 minute intervals were used, the highest prediction performance was 0.008 for MAE and 0.011 for RMSE in LGBM. In addition, it was confirmed that the factor that most influences VPD prediction after 20 minutes was VPD (VPD_y__71) from the past 20 minutes rather than environmental factors. Using the results of this study, it is possible to increase crop productivity through VPD prediction, condensation of greenhouses, and prevention of disease occurrence.

As a result of the analysis, the evaluation index in the decision tree was identified as AUC: 99.8%, the regular CA was 96.9%, precision: 97.0%, Recall: 96.9%, and F1: 96.9%, which were measured as the most suitable. In the priority analysis, on-base percentage, OPS, and sacrifice fly were measured the highest, while sacrifice bunt and double play were ranked low. This study is meaningful in that Korean professional baseball teams presented predictive models of batting variables in deriving results for advancing to the playoffs. It is also meaningful that it has proven the priorities of major hitting variables suggested by Saber Metrics such as on-base percentage and OPS."

Against this background, this study aims to explore the influencing factors on the prediction of the new listing date of public offering stocks by using various machine learning algorithms based on data from issuers' prospectuses and securities filings. For companies listed on the KOSDAQ market for the last three years, a model for predicting the initial public offering stock price was built using logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. As a result of the study, the top variables that affect the initial price of public offering stocks were ‘amount available for circulation’, ‘general offer competition rate’, and ‘confirmation ratio for mandatory holding(lock-up)’, and it was confirmed that these variables are the main influencing factors on the initial price of public offering stocks. The smaller the circulating supply (average 20% or less), the higher the 100% probability of starting. In addition, general subscriptions incur opportunity costs due to the time required for margin payment and return. Despite these opportunity costs, a high subscription competition ratio has a positive effect on the excess return. Finally, the ‘obligatory holding commitment ratio’ is a commitment ratio in which institutional investors do not sell public offering stocks for a certain period of time during the demand forecasting process, and the higher the ratio (on average, more than 20%), the higher the probability of a 100% initial public offering price."

In order to proactive identify students at risk of dropout, this study built a decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and deep learning-based dropout prediction model using academic data that can be easily obtained from each university’s academic management system. Their performances were subsequently analyzed and compared. The analysis revealed that while the logistic regression-based prediction model exhibited the highest recall rate, its f-1 value and ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve) value were comparatively lower. On the other hand, the random forest-based prediction model demonstrated superior performance across all other metrics except recall value. In addition, in order to assess model performance over distinct prediction periods, we divided these periods into short-term (within one semester), medium-term (within two semesters), and long-term (within three semesters). The results underscored that the long-term prediction yielded the highest predictive efficacy.

A total of 14 financial ratios related to growth, profitability, stability, and activity indicators of 22 hotels were used for the empirical analysis of the study. In addition, after verifying the significance of the variables to set a model that can be classified as marginal and normal companies, nine financial ratio variables were finally selected in 2018, seven in 2019, and eight in 2020. The results of the empirical analysis are as follows. First, since this study focuses on the predictive model of marginal hotels, the predictive rates are important. It can be seen that the predictive rate of marginal companies using the confusion matrix is relatively low compared to normal hotels, and is increasing over time. This means that the financial health of hotels has deteriorated due to COVID-19. Second, after checking the performance evaluation indicators of each model by year, the logistic regression model was found to be the highest of all performance evaluation indicators, and was presented in the order of support vector machine and neural network. In particular, when it comes to AUC and accuracy, all three of the above models were shown to exceed 90%.

In this work, a generic framework for combining the existing formula of I-V characteristics with artificial neural network is presented. The weight and bias values of ANN for LTPS and IGZO TFTs is obtained and implemented into PSPICE circuit simulator to predict CMOS inverter.

Most of the preceding studies were predictions of used car prices using vehicle specifications and some options for vehicles. As a result of the study, it was confirmed that there was a nonlinear relationship between used car prices and some specification variables. Accordingly, the researchers tried to solve the nonlinear problem by executing a Machine Learning model.

Additionally, we searched suitable hyper-parameters, thereby implementing the optimal model.Following the training process, the random forest algorithm exhibited the highest prediction performance among all the models trained. The random forest model trained with the original imbalanced data achieved commendable AUC score of approximately 0.76. The performance of the random forest model trained with the oversampling imbalanced data showed significant improvement, reaching AUC score of 0.85.

And based on the results, we tried to find educational implications that can help learn state classification of matter.Methods  For 31 elementary and middle school science teachers enrolled in the Graduate School of Education at the College of Education located in the central region, matter classification activities were performed and a decision tree algorithm was applied to the machine learning model. And the effectiveness of the program was confirmed through model performance evaluation such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall.Results  The classification accuracy of developed machine learning model for classifying state of matter was 0.820, the F1-score was 0.820, the precision was 0.826 and the recall was 0.820. In addition, the degree of discrepancy between the classification results of science teachers and the classification results of the decision tree algorithm was larger in heterogeneous mixtures than in pure matters or homogeneous mixtures. This discrepancy was analyzed as a phenomenon that occurs because science teachers do not consistently apply the classification criteria from the macroscopic and microscopic perspectives or do have the concept that a specific matter is a specific state in advance when classifying the state of matter. Based on the results of these studies, the cause of confusion revealed in the process of classifying the state of matter pointed out in previous studies was found.Conclusions  Based on the research results, it was possible to find the cause of confusion revealed in the process of classifying the state of matter of students pointed out in previous studies, and since machine learning can be an effective tool for diagnosing learning conditions, it is suggested that teacher training is needed to utilize it."

Between 2012 and 2020, universities with low evaluation results in the government's university restructuring evaluation are defined as universities in business crisis. The goal was to discover factors that could predict a university in business crisis by using data such as students, faculty, and financial data, which are university components. As a result of the analysis, when using the Random Forest, it was possible to accurately identify universities in business crisis compared to the Logistic Regression model. The results of predicting universities in business crisis through shap analysis and statistical (t-test) are as follows. First of all, the ROC-AUC value that can evaluate the predictive power was checked by applying the logistic regression model and random forest to the same data for the prediction of universities in business crisis, and the logistic regression model was evaluated as 0.819 for universities and 0.854 for colleges. , Random Forest was evaluated as 0.927for universities and 0.943 for colleges. In the case of universities, the factors that have a positive(+) influence on the prediction of universities in business crisis are the dropout rate, region_Gyeongnam. On the other hand, the factors that have a negative(-) effect on the prediction of universities in business crisis are education expenses per student, education expense reimbursement rate, enrollment rate, maintenance recruitment rate, new student recruitment rate, employment rate, operating expense burden rate, and research expenses per full-time faculty member. In the case of colleges, the factors that have a positive (+) influence on the prediction of universities in business crisis are the carryover rate, teacher retention rate, region_Gangwon, dropout rate and debt ratio. On the other hand, the factors that have a negative(-) effect on the prediction of universities in business crisis are education expenses per student, student recruitment rate, university size, education expense reimbursement rate, maintenance recruitment rate, operating expense burden rate, new student recruitment rate, scholarship payment rate, and research expenses per full-time faculty member. The contribution of this study is to propose a new methodology to predict universities in business crisis using machine learning techniques, which are widely used recently."

It seeks to identify the factors that influence the method of resolving public conflicts and determine which predictive factors are significant. To achieve this, machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines were employed to examine the factors affecting public conflict resolution. These methods consistently highlight the duration and type of public conflicts as critical variables in determining conflict resolution. By analyzing the specific importance of these variables, it becomes possible to predict the resolution method based on the duration of the conflict and whether the major participants are government or civilians. When combined with the number of participants, issues and nature of public conflicts, predictions become more reliable. However, model evaluations revealed the need for more detailed and precise data collection for future public conflict studies. Nevertheless, the models exhibited lower precision, recall, and accuracy than expected, suggesting that significant improvements are needed in various aspects. These improvements should focus more on expanding independent variables and providing a precise distinction for the dependent variable, rather than relying solely on machine learning techniques."

In addition, a theoretical equation for predicting desk illumination through sensor values was produced. However, the desk illumination measured through the theoretical formula had a disadvantage of 70% accuracy and could not consider the blinds in the classroom. Machine learning was conducted to solve these shortcomings. Since constructing a machine learning dataset through actual measurement has time and space limitations, a simulation was produced to construct a dataset. As a result of comparing the produced simulation and the measured value, there was an error within 5%, which was used as machine learning data. There are a total of 192 sets and 1,728 data of natural light sensor values and classroom desk illumination values measured by changing direction, blind use, season, and time through simulation. As a result of learning this through the XGBoost regression model, the simulation value showed an accuracy of 95.4%, and the actual measurement value showed an accuracy of 95.2%. In addition, as a result of predicting desk illumination by natural lighting in each season and calculating the lighting energy saving effect, it was found to have an energy saving effect of 13.0% in winter, 29.6% in spring and fall, and 40.7% in summer."

The study analyzed data from the 6th wave of the 2013 Korean Educational Longitudinal Study and utilized latent profile analysis to explore the typology of multiple citizenship. To identify the predictive factors determining multiple citizenship, an automated machine learning algorithm was used to find the most performant model. SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) techniques were then applied to provide interpretable explanations of the machine learning results. The key findings are as follows. First, in the latent profile analysis, the multiple citizenship of adolescents was categorized into “high multiple citizenship,” “moderate multiple citizenship,” and “low multiple citizenship.” Second, the results of automated machine learning showed that gradient boosting exhibited the highest performance among machine learning techniques. When predicting the key variables related to adolescents’ multiple citizenship through machine learning, it was found that communication competence emerged as the most important predictor, followed by cognitive information processing skills, awareness of cultural and artistic activities, independent career maturity, educational experiences involving cultural diversity and international issues, gender, and relationships with teachers and peers. Based on these results, this study provides policy recommendations and implications for effective civic education for adolescents."

Models were developed based on the accessibility of variable data, their high correlation with mortality, and their diversity. The research results indicated that variables such as respiratory pattern, pulse rate, RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale), and post-surgery admission status showed relatively high importance compared to other variables. Models demonstrated higher predictive power compared to APACHE II, Random Forest and logistic regression models (AUC .93 ~ .98, accuracy .91 ~ .95). The model utilizing various variables showed the highest predictive power, but even a model based solely on accessible physical examination records demonstrated sufficient predictive capability. It was confirmed that patient observations recorded by nurses holds high importance and accessibility in mortality prediction. Also using simplified variables with machine learning techniques can efficiently predict mortality. It is expected that healthcare professionals can reduce the burden of record-keeping for mortality prediction and receive more accurate information about patients."

However, existing training approaches often failed to consider learners' individual characteristics, resulting in inadequate training for some individuals. This study aimed to investigate the impact of personal characteristics on learning performance in VR-based construction safety training using machine learning and SHAP (SHAPley Additional exPlanations). This study revealed that age exerted the greatest influence on learning performance, while work experience had the least impact. Furthermore, age exhibited a negative relationship with learning performance, indicating that the introduction of VR-based construction safety training can be effective for younger individuals. On the other hand, academic degree, qualifications, and work experience exhibited a positive relationship. To enhance learning performance for individuals with lower academic degree, it is necessary to provide content that is easier to understand. The lower qualifications and work experience have minimal impact on learning performance, so it is important to consider other learners' characteristics so as to provide appropriate educational content. This study confirmed that personal characteristics can significantly affect learning performance in VR-based construction safety training, highlighting the potential for leveraging these findings to provide effective safety training for construction workers."

After learning several boosting-based ensemble models using the generated final dataset, we demonstrated how these ensemble models classify network traffic using various performance metrics. Based on the F-1 score, we showed that XGBoost with no rare class processing is the best in the multi-class traffic environment. We recognized that machine learning ensemble models through Mitre ATT&CK label conversion and oversampling processing have differences over existing studies, but have limitations due to (1) the inability to match perfectly when converting between existing datasets and Mitre ATT&CK labels and (2) the presence of excessive sparse classes. Nevertheless, Catboost with B-SMOTE achieved the classification accuracy of 0.9526, which is expected to be able to automatically detect normal/abnormal network traffic."

The proposed method extracts image frames from video recordings of brain gymnastic hand movements. The coordinates of the user's hand are detected by a model that learned brain gymnastic hand movements through object detection. Then, skeleton extraction was performed using the Mediapipe library. Collecting data directly, we built and labeled a dataset for each behavior. Two brain gymnastic movements were analyzed using six machine learning classifiers.

The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) currently uses the same criteria for all regions in Korea for watch and warning based on the maximum cumulative rainfall with durations of 3-hour and 12-hour to reduce damage. However, KMA's criteria do not consider the regional characteristics of damages caused by heavy rainfall and typhoon events. In this regard, it is necessary to develop new criteria considering regional characteristics of damage and cumulative rainfalls in durations, establishing four stages: blue, yellow, orange, and red. A classification model, called DSCM (Disaster Severity Classification Model), for the four-stage disaster severity was developed using four machine learning models (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost). This study applied DSCM to local governments of Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi Province province. To develop DSCM, we used data on rainfall, cumulative rainfall, maximum rainfalls for durations of 3-hour and 12-hour, and antecedent rainfall as independent variables, and a 4-class damage scale for heavy rain damage and typhoon damage for each local government as dependent variables. As a result, the Decision Tree model had the highest accuracy with an F1-Score of 0.56. We believe that this developed DSCM can help identify disaster risk at each stage and contribute to reducing damage through efficient disaster management for local governments based on specific events."

As a result of the analysis, the district rating revealed that Gwangjin-gu and Songpa-gu were relatively at higher risk, and the density analysis of at-risk buildings predicted that Seocho-gu, Gwanak-gu, and Gangseo-gu were relatively at higher risk. Finally, the result of the statistical analysis technique was predicted as more dangerous than those of the machine learning technique. However, considering that about 18.9% of the buildings in Seoul are designed to withstand the Seismic intensity of 6.5 (MMI), which is the standard for seismic-resistant design in South Korea, the result of the machine learning technique was predicted to be more accurate. The current research is limited in that it only considers buildings without taking into account factors such as population density, police stations, and fire stations. Considering these limitations in future studies would lead to more comprehensive and valuable research."

In particular, GPS-based real-time localization is commonly used. However, unlike outdoors, not only does the GPS reception rate decrease significantly indoors, but it is also difficult to accurately measure the user's indoor location using only GPS latitude and longitude information. In this study, we propose to measure the user's indoor location using RSSI (received signal strength indicator). For this purpose, an indoor localization study was conducted by applying machine learning classifiers, SVM, decision tree, ExtraTrees, random forest, and KNN to RSSI data. Among the machine learning classifiers, random forest exhibited the best performance. Therefore, we applied random forest-based RFE to extract features from RSSI data. We confirmed that even with a smaller amount of data, it was possible to achieve more accurate indoor positioning. In addition, it was confirmed through regression analysis that latitude and longitude can be estimated from RSSI data, so that indoor as well as outdoor locations can be estimated."

Despite the efforts and accumulation of various studies, it is still difficult to find a study that utilizes AI algorithms to predict the final ranking of Korean women's professional golfers. Considering the industrial and managerial value of top-level players in KLPGA, a study that predicts the category of players who can enter the top 10 in the next tournament becomes important and significant in both theoretical and practical terms. Reflecting the calls for such research, this study was conducted to apply AI machine learning algorithms to predict the final ranking of Korean women's professional golfers, focusing on whether they will enter the top 10 (Top 10 Finish). To empirically conduct this study, we used Python 3.10.9 to crawl and collect data from the KLPGA and the event website, which includes all competition events, match records, and player information from 2008 to May 2023. Based on this data, this study utilized five AI algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Light GBM, Elastic Net, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG Boost), and Logistic Regression. For the demonstration of this study, 36 variables that can affect the outcome of a golf game were used as independent variables and whether the player entered the top 10 as a dependent variable, and the data was trained and analyzed by the five AI algorithms above. The results showed that support vector machines performed the best among the AI algorithms. Based on these empirical results, for example, the support vector machine was applied to predict which players could enter the top 10 in two events in May 2023, and 17 players were matched with the prediction to enter the top 10 in those events, and 11 of those players actually established themselves in the top 10.

However, because most research is based on training-inference strategies that treat missing trace gather data as a 2D image with a blank area, a sufficient number of fully sampled data are required for training.

In this study, we describe a method for constructing networks that vary depending on the maximum number of consecutive gaps in seismic field data and the training method. To verify the applicability of the proposed method to field data, we applied our method to time-migrated seismic data acquired from the Vincent oilfield in the Exmouth Sub-basin area of Western Australia and compared the results with those of the conventional trace interpolation method. Both methods showed high interpolation performance, as confirmed by quantitative indicators, and the interpolation performance was uniformly good at all frequencies."

In this study, a grid-based soil contamination map was created from the sampling data of heavy metal concentrations in soil in abandoned mine areas using Ordinary Kriging. Five factors that were judged to affect the prediction error of the soil contamination map were selected, and the variation of the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the predicted value and the actual value was analyzed based on the Leave-one-out technique. Then, using a machine learning algorithm, derived the top three factors affecting the RMSE. As a result, it was analyzed that Variogram Model, Minimum Neighbors, and Anisotropy factors have the largest impact on RMSE in the Standard interpolation. For the variogram models, the Spherical model showed the lowest RMSE, while the Minimum Neighbors had the lowest value at 3 and then increased as the value increased. In the case of Anisotropy, it was found to be more appropriate not to consider anisotropy.

In general, variables such as launch angle and launch speed are used to predict hitters' home-run and hit. However, launch angle and launch speed(batting results) are correlated with the pitcher's pitching. Therefore, in this study, the artificial intelligence model that predict home-run and hit was developed using only the pitcher's pitching information, excluding the batting information of the hitter. To develop the artificial intelligence model, pitching data from the 2022 season of the Major League Baseball(MLB) collected. (independent variable :  pitch type, release speed, zone, stand, pitch throws, ball count, strike count / dependent(prediction) variable : hit and home-run) The artificial intelligence model was developed using XGBoost, one of the machine learning method. As a result of the development, the artificial intelligence model performance was accuracy 86.92%, precision 99.90%, recall 86.95%, and F1 score 92.98%.

These fine dust is very small in size and permeates the body without being filtered from the nose or bronchial tubes, causing inflammation through asthma, lung disease, or the action of immune cells. Recently, it was found that Korea has the highest concentration of fine dust in the world, and it is important to take measures through an accurate forecast system because fine dust directly affects not only health but also ecosystems and crops. Therefore, this paper attempted to compare machine learning prediction performance of fine dust concentration using weather data provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration and air pollutant data provided by Air Korea. As for the region, data from Incheon Metropolitan City, which is the closest to the Shandong Peninsula, the inflow path of yellow dust, were extracted, and a model was built after confirming the correlation between various weather factors and air pollutants in Incheon. MLP, RNN, LSTM, GRU, and CNN were used as models, and predictive performance was compared by organizing basic hyperparameters and single layers. After that, the GRU2 model, which added layers to the GRU1 (single layer) model, was newly constructed and compared with the GRU1 model with the best prediction performance. Prediction performance was evaluated by MAE and RMSE in test data. Most of them showed similar predictive performance, but it was confirmed that the GRU1 model had the best performance compared to other models, with MAE 8.80 and RMSE 14.61.

For the modeling methods, logistic regression analysis and ensemble techniques, such as gradient boost and random forest, were used while the oversampling technique was utilized to address the imbalance problem of the forest fire data. The model developed in this study predicted 239 out of 333 forest fire occurrences during the nationwide forest fire period in 2020 with a prediction accuracy of approximately 71.8%. Forest fires that occur during such periods are highly influenced by different factors affecting the climate, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation. In Gangwon-do, in addition to these factors, a high correlation between farmland density and stem volume per hectare has also been associated with increased forest fire occurrences. The significance of this study lies in the fact that it presents a customized wildfire occurrence prediction model that can be used in the administrative parts, which serve as the basic centers for wildfire prevention, of provinces and cities across the country."

Recently, environmental issues have been emerged along with global warming and the shortage of residential space. the governments are focusing on the development of eco-friendly city to solve the above problems. reckless urban development can weaken the unique locality of the region. So, the historical, cultural, and residential sentiment of the city should be considered. In this situation, color management becomes an important factor for consistent urban planning and development. Color management is a high-level concept that oversees all parts related to color, such as harmony with the surrounding environment and color development that suits the purpose. This study aims to conduct a comparative analysis of each overseas case in order to harmonize the natural environment and artifacts while maintaining the direction and consistency of landscape structure development through color management. (Method) With the characteristics of locality, environmental color cases of eco-city to which eco-friendly policies are applied are analyzed.Based on machine learning(K-mean clustering), environmental color analysis of overseas cases related to Eco city is conducted. (Results) In this study, Canadian dockside green gives dynamic elements to the entire city with the appropriate use of vivid colors suitable for waterfront spaces. The German mesestream shows a cool and clean image even though it is an orchid color using high-definition colors that harmonize well with nature. Swedish Hamabi Hirstad gives a mature image.Overall, the color difference is planned to a large extent, and the use of colors opposite the surrounding green areas makes nature stand out. British Bedjed forms a unique image by stimulating curiosity with various materials and point colors, and shows individuality and originality. Finnish Vicky forms a soft and gentle city image with the color of garnish and medium chroma. Masdar, Abu Dhabi, UAE, also applies regional colors to the exterior colors of the building, reflecting the characteristics of the area and the color plan that matches the unique building shape. (Conclusions) our research confirms that color trends are planned and carried out differently according to local emotions, history, surrounding environment, and residents' emotions for each country's eco-city. It is important to show the identity of the region that can be harmonized with the natural environment through continuous and systematic color planning considering locality. However, these cases alone have limitations in making color guidelines detailed. Therefore, in terms of color management considering locality, it is necessary to develop environmental or regional color guidelines, standardized color guidelines, and regular color management training for related workers, and future research needs to create color management guidelines for each category."

Even in mountains or national parks, there are about 600 mineral springs that can be found occasionally in neighboring parks or trails in the metropolitan area. However, due to irregular and manual water quality tests, people drink mineral water without knowing the test results in real time. Therefore, in this study, we intend to develop a model that can predict the quality of the spring water in real time by exploring the factors affecting the quality of the spring water and collecting data scattered in various places. After limiting the regions to Seoul and Gyeonggi-do due to the limitations of data collection, we obtained data on water quality tests from 2015 to 2020 for about 300 mineral springs in 18 cities where data management is well performed. A total of 10 factors were finally selected after two rounds of review among various factors that are considered to affect the suitability of the mineral spring water quality. Using AutoML, an automated machine learning technology that has recently been attracting attention, we derived the top 5 models based on prediction performance among about 20 machine learning methods. Among them, the catboost model has the highest performance with a prediction classification accuracy of 75.26%. In addition, as a result of examining the absolute influence of the variables used in the analysis through the SHAP method on the prediction, the most important factor was whether or not a water quality test was judged nonconforming in the previous water quality test. It was confirmed that the temperature on the day of the inspection and the altitude of the mineral spring had an influence on whether the water quality was unsuitable."

As much as we rely on them, excessive smartphone use can cause physical and psychological problems in humans. This is called smartphone overdependence, and there is a lot of research on it. In this study, we proposed a smartphone dependency classification model using random forest, a machine learning technique, for the entire survey population based on survey data from the smartphone dependency survey conducted by the National Information Society Agency. Since the data on smartphone overdependence is imbalanced and the percentage of smartphone overdependence is very small compared to the general users, we utilized the oversampling technique to overcome this, and showed excellent classification rate, sensitivity, and specificity by increasing the percentage of smartphone overdependence by 2, 3, and 4 times. We found that the most influential variable in the classification of smartphone dependence was the use of smartphones for leisure pursuits such as playing games, watching movies, and watching videos. We may all be heading towards a naturalized smartphone dependency. We may need to relax the strict criteria for smartphone dependence in the past to accept and improve the current situation."

In this study, 500 native Korean words, Sino- Korean words, and loanwords were collected, and after romanizing and decomposing them into bigram and trigram lists, the bigrams and trigrams were entered into the naïve Bayes classifier. We tested models with and without syllable boundaries, and found that both the bigram and trigram models were over 80% accurate. Contrary to the expectation that the performance of the models would improve as more information about Korean phonotactics was included in the training and validation data, the difference in performance between the bigram and trigram models was not significant. The model that included syllable boundaries in the phoneme sequence information had slightly higher accuracy than the model without syllable boundary information. When comparing the classification results of all five models, the accuracy of the bigram model with syllable boundaries was 83.55%, which was the best. For now, we have modified the model to consider only phoneme sequence information and syllable boundaries, but it is expected that the accuracy of the model can be improved by training the model while excluding bigrams and trigrams, which occur in similar proportions in all categories, and by increasing the size of the data."

We compared the prediction accuracy of the mathematical models (Thomas model and Yan model) and the multiple linear regression model with that of ANN. This study showed the applicability of the ANN model for predicting the performance of activated carbon columns.Methods : The adsorption module contained 79.8 kg/module of wood-based activated carbon. The gas with 800 ppm-THC of toluene flowed downward from the top at about 5,700 m3/h. The breakthrough point was taken as 200 ppm-THC, the same as VOC emission regulation. The desorption was carried out using 130 m3/h of hot gas flowing upwards with reduced pressure (-150 to -200 mbar) and high heat (170℃). Adsorption and desorption cycles were conducted 6 times using 3 batches of activated carbon modules. Thomas model, Yan model, multiple linear regression model, and ANN model were developed to predict the breakthrough of Cout/Cin.Results and Discussion : The Thomas model and the Yan model provided the R2 values  of 0.25 and 0.28, respectively, for predicting the Cout/Cin of all adsorption module batches and cycles, and the prediction accuracies were low. This could be because these two models do not consider temperature and pressure change operating conditions in the models. Also, the prediction accuracy of Cout/Cin was low when the initial inlet concentration and flow rate conditions were different for each batch. The multiple linear regression model considers all operating factors in the model, but the prediction accuracy of Cout/Cin was low as R2 of 0.45. On the other hand, the ANN model predicted the Cout/Cin with R2 higher than 0.97 for all adsorption module batches. In particular, even with the non-ideal data, the ANN model derived a breakthrough of Cout/Cin close to the experimental value.Conclusion : The ANN model provided high prediction performance for the breakthrough of Cout/Cin even under non-ideal operation conditions and was expected to be helpful for actual THC adsorption column operation. The accuracy of the ANN model will be further improved if data are accumulated under various conditions."

The proposed imaging technique utilizes the amplitude values obtained from these two data while maintaining the original values of the In-phase and Quadrature-phase parts of the signal. This approach forms a structure similar to the RGB(Red-Green-Blue) color model used in conventional images, using these three pieces of data. As a classification model, a light-weight CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model was constructed, which is a well-fitted neural network model for image processing. The data is collected in a real 5G environment to confirm the feasibility and applicability in the real 5G system. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of the index classification accuracy, the imaging time, and the model learning time while comparing with the benchmark methods in literature such as GASF(Gramian Angular Summation Field), GADF(Gramian Angular Difference Field), and MTF(Markov Transition Field). The proposed imaging technique showed a higher accuracy of at least 24% in all SNR(Signal-to-Noise Ratio) levels. in terms of imaging time, while the existing imaging methods of the same dimensions took around 1.5 seconds for two GAFs and approximately 95 seconds for MTF preprocessing, the proposed imaging technique demonstrated a faster preprocessing speed of about 0.7 seconds. Additionally, when considering model training time, the conventional imaging methods that achieved the best classification accuracy required approximately 212 seconds to complete training.

In this study, a machine learning model was developed to estimate the strength of aluminum alloys using NDT parameters known to be related to material strength, such as ultrasonic longitudinal/transverse velocity, attenuation coefficient, nonlinearity parameter, and eddy current electrical conductivity. The training data set consisted of NDT parameters obtained from more than 400 specimens with diverse strength distributions, along with tensile test data. A dedicated automated measurement system was employed to enhance the reliability of NDT parameter measurements. The estimated strength achieved more than 90% accuracy when a ±20 MPa interval accuracy was applied to the ground-truth strength. As data accumulation continues in the future, the performance of the proposed model is expected to improve further. Considering that destructive tensile tests possess an uncertainty of approximately 10%, the proposed technique offers an alternative to destructive testing, thereby establishing itself as a promising technology."

Because the purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of a specific type based on GHG emissions, clustering analysis is more useful than traditional regression analysis. As a result of the analysis, it is found that GHG emissions per capita are decreasing. In addition, group with high per capita GHG emissions is characterized by larger per capita national income, higher share of manufacturing and agriculture among industries, and higher share of added value compared to intermediate input. As such, one of the characteristics of countries with higher per capita GHG have lager per capita national income, which is a unique result. In addition, the higher the proportion of agriculture, the higher the per capita greenhouse gas emissions, which is considered to be because agriculture is also an industry that emits a lot of greenhouse gases. Countries with a higher ratio of value-added to intermediate input are likely to be developed countries with larger per capita national income, so per capita GHG emissions are also likely to be higher. In terms of total GHG, South Korea is the 9th largest country in 2000 among the 44 countries analyzed in this study, and the 7th largest country in 2018. However, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per capita, Korea falls into the middle group regardless of the year."

Among them, senile dementia, which disrupts daily life, is best detected at an early stage because there is no cure, even with technological advances. However, many preliminary studies to predict dementia require continuous imaging data, such as MRI and retinal imaging data, and are expensive. These methods have the disadvantage that they cannot be applied to all people, so this study aims to develop low-cost predictive dementia detection. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the main variables that most influenced the presence of dementia using deep learning prediction models such as XGBsoot and lightGBM by utilizing various activity data such as exercise duration, high-intensity activity duration, and metabolic rate, and sleep data such as deep sleep duration and breathing rate per minute to determine sleep quality.

Since the company’s financial information is updated quarterly, there is a problem that timeliness is insufficient in predicting the possibility of a company’s business closure in real time. Evaluated companies that want to improve this need a method of judging the soundness of a company that uses information other than financial information to judge the soundness of a target company. To this end, as information technology has made it easier to collect non-financial information about companies, research has been conducted to apply additional variables and various methodologies other than financial information to predict corporate bankruptcy. It has become an important research task to determine whether it has an effect. In this study, we examined the impact of electronic payment-related information, which constitutes non-financial information, when predicting the closure of business operators using electronic payment service and examined the difference in closure prediction accuracy according to the combination of financial and non-financial information. Specifically, three research models consisting of a financial information model, a non-financial information model, and a combined model were designed, and the closure prediction accuracy was confirmed with six algorithms including the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm. The model combining financial and non-financial information showed the highest prediction accuracy, followed by the non-financial information model and the financial information model in order. As for the prediction accuracy of business closure by algorithm, XGBoost showed the highest prediction accuracy among the six algorithms. As a result of examining the relative importance of a total of 87 variables used to predict business closure, it was confirmed that more than 70% of the top 20 variables that had a significant impact on the prediction of business closure were non-financial information. Through this, it was confirmed that electronic payment-related information of non-financial information is an important variable in predicting business closure, and the possibility of using non-financial information as an alternative to financial information was also examined. Based on this study, the importance of collecting and utilizing non-financial information as information that can predict business closure is recognized, and a plan to utilize it for corporate decision-making is also proposed."

The quality of current construction cost estimates are highly dependent on the expert's personal experience and skills to estimate the arithmetic average construction cost based on past cases, which makes construction cost estimates subjective and unreliable.An objective approach in construction cost estimation shall be developed with the use of machine learning. In this study, past cases of road projects were analyzed and a machine learning model was developed to produce a more accurate and time-efficient construction cost estimate in teh planning stage.METHODS : After conducting case analysis of 100 road construction, a database was constructed including the road construction's details, drawings, and completion reports. To improve the construction cost estimation, Mallow's Cp. BIC, Adjusted R methodology was applied to find the optimal variables. Consequently, a plannigs-stage road construction cost estimation model was developed by applying multiple regression analysis, regression tree, case-based inference model, and artificial neural network (ANN, DNN).RESULTS : The construction cost estimation model showed excellent prediction performance despite an insufficient amount of learning data. Ten cases were randomly selected from the data base and each developed machine learning model was applied to the selected cases to calculate for the error rate, which should be less than 30% to be considered as acceptable according to American Estimating Association. As a result of the analysis, the error rates of all developed machine learning models were found to be acceptable with values rangine from 17.3% to 26.0%. Among the developed models, the ANN model yielded the least error rate.CONCLUSIONS : The results of this study can help raise awareness of the importance of building a systematic database in the construction industry, which is disadvantageous in machine learning and artificial intelligence development. In addition, it is believed that it can provide basic data for research to determine the feasibility of construction projects that require a large budget, such as road projects."

MPARN: multi-scale path attention residual network for fault diagnosis of rotating machines,2023,"['convolutional neural network', 'fault diagnosis', 'rotatingmachines', 'multi-scale structure', 'path attentionmodule', 'multi-scale attention residual block']",,"Multi-scale convolutional neural network structures consisting of parallel convolution paths with different kernel sizes have been developed to extract features from multiple temporal scales and applied for fault diagnosis of rotating machines. However, when the extracted features are used to the same extent regardless of the temporal scale inside the network, good diagnostic performance may not be guaranteed due to the influence of the features of certain temporal scale less related to faults. Considering this issue, this paper presents a novel architecture called a multi-scale path attention residual network to further enhance the feature representational ability of a multi-scale structure. Multi-scale path attention residual network adopts a path attention module after a multi-scale dilated convolution layer, assigning different weights to features from different convolution paths. In addition, the network is composed of a stacked multi-scale attention residual block structure to continuously extract meaningful multi-scale characteristics and relationships between scales. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by examining its application to a helical gearbox vibration dataset and a permanent magnet synchronous motor current dataset. The results show that the proposed multi-scale path attention residual network can improve the feature learning ability of the multi-scale structure and achieve better fault diagnosis performance."

Therefore, this study aims to develop a corporate financial performance prediction model using machine learning techniques to differentiate it from existing methods.· Differences from prior research:Most previous ESG studies have shown that ESG activities have a significant impact on financial performance using regression analysis models. However, due to data collection restrictions, evaluation of corporate financial performance has relied primarily on the financial factors of financial statements.

Therefore, when predicting ROA, which is a measure of corporate performance, it can be seen that predicting including ESG evaluation grade information can predict more accurately than predicting ROA without including ESG evaluation grade information.· Contribution points and expected effects: By proposing a new research methodology that utilizes machine learning in corporate performance research, it provides useful predictive model design guidelines for subsequent researchers. In practice, it provides investors with investment strategies that take into account ESG ratings and meaningful information for companies to recognize the importance of ESG management."

Among them, the RF model showed the best performance overseas, but through experiments, it was confirmed that the GMM showed the highest classification performance for domestic aviation data by reflecting the aspects specialized in domestic terrain."
Machining feature recognition using BRepNet,2023,['· BRepNet · Connected-component analysis · Deep learning · Feature recognition · Machining feature'],,"Numerous attempts have been made to recognize the machining features in three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design (CAD) models using various methods since the 1980s. Recently, deep learning approaches have been explored for machining feature recognition. However, the boundary representation (BRep) model, the most common representation of 3D CAD models, is difficult to use directly in deep learning because of its complex structure. To solve this problem, BRepNet was recently proposed. This study proposes a method for recognizing machining features in 3D CAD models represented by BRep using BRepNet. In the proposed method, BRepNet is used to classify each face of a 3D CAD model based on the machining features. Next, the classified faces are combined into machining features using connected-component analysis. In addition, a dataset is generated to train the BRepNet model.Subsequently, the proposed method is implemented and tested for verification. The proposed method exhibits an accuracy of 96.03 % and part intersection over union (pIoU) of 90.57 %."

This study aims to apply AI algorithms to predict the outcome of Korean professional basketball games and verify the applicability of sports betting. More specifically, we went beyond simply predicting the outcome of the game in a way that appears in actual sports betting by categorizing the outcome of the game according to the goal difference, such as winning by more than 6 points, losing by less than 5 points, and losing by more than 6 points. We collected 71 variables related to the games of each Korean professional basketball team from the 2017∼2018 season to the 2022∼2023 season, generated 20 additional advanced metrics, and systematically preprocessed the data. Based on these variables, we trained and tested all variables using Light-GBM, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Based on the CNN algorithm, which has the best prediction performance, we predicted the matches of each team in the 2022∼2023 season, and as a result of analyzing the application of sports betting, we accurately predicted the results of 494 matches out of 540 matches.

Fault diagnosis of rotating machines based on modified hierarchical fluctuation dispersion entropy and multi-cluster feature selection,2023,['· Fault diagnosis · Kernel extreme learning machine · Modified hierarchical fluctuation dispersion entropy · Multi-cluster feature selection · Rotating machinery · Whale optimization algorithm'],,"The vibration signal of rotating mechanical equipment contains a large amount of information that can be used for the fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment. However, the vibration information is distributed in multiple dimensions, and a single-scale analysis cannot effectively reflect its damage characteristics, reducing the accuracy of fault diagnosis. Accordingly, an improved hierarchical fluctuation dispersion entropy (MHFDE) method based on the improved hierarchical processing is proposed. MHFDE can simultaneously mine low- and highfrequency features in the time series, avoiding information omission. Comparison results of the simulated signals show that the proposed method has the advantages of high stability and accurate measurement of complexity. In combination with the multi-cluster feature selection (MCFS) and kernel limit learning machine (KELM) optimized by whale optimization algorithm (WOA), a rotating machinery damage recognition method based on MHFDE-MCFS and WOA-KEM was proposed. Three sets of typical rotating machinery datasets are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that this method can not only accurately and stably identify the damage types of the three selected machinery but also have a higher accuracy of damage recognition compared with the existing feature extraction methods."
BRepGAT: Graph neural network to segment machining feature faces in a B-rep model,2023,"['graph neural networks', 'deep learning', 'boundary representation', 'machining feature', 'face segmentation']",,"In recent years, there have been many studies using artificial intelligence to recognize machining features in three-dimensional models in the computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing field. Most of these studies converted the original CAD data into images, point clouds, or voxels for recognition. This led to information loss during the conversion process, resulting in decreased recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model called the boundary representation graph attention network (BRepGAT) to segment faces in an original boundary representation (B-rep) model containing machining features. We define descriptors that represent information about the faces and edges of the B-rep model from the perspective of feature recognition. These descriptors are extracted from the B-rep model and transformed into homogeneous graph data, which are then passed to graph networks. BRepGAT recognizes machining features from the graph data input. Our experimental results using the MFCAD18++ dataset showed that BRepGAT achieved state-of-the-art recognition accuracy (99.1%). Furthermore, BRepGAT showed relatively robust performance on other datasets besides MFCAD18++."
Thermal deformation prediction for spindle system of machining center based on multi-source heterogeneous information fusion,2023,['· Spindle system · Multi-source heterogeneous information · Information fusion · Feature extraction · Machine learning · Nonlinear prediction'],,"In order to predict the thermal deformation of CNC machine tool spindle system more accurately, a method based on multi-source heterogeneous information fusion is proposed. Aiming at the problem that it is difficult to obtain the global information of thermal deformation with a single type of information source, the effective prediction of thermal deformation of spindle system in machining center is realized under the fusion of temperature and vibration signals. First, the combined denoising method of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet threshold is used to preprocess the vibration data. Then, the time-domain, frequencydomain, and time-frequency features of vibration signals are extracted, and the feature dimension is reduced based on correlation analysis and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA).After dimensionality reduction, the vibration data and temperature information are fused in the eigenmatrix. The nonlinear prediction of thermal deformation is studied by support vector regression for grid search parameter optimization (GS-SVR) and support vector regression for particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVR) methods. In order to realize the information acquisition of multi-channel temperature, vibration, and verify the effectiveness of the prediction model in the case of information fusion, a specific machining center is taken as the research object and experiments are performed based on multi-channel and heterogeneous signal acquisition. Finally, the prediction results based on different information sources are compared and analyzed.The results show that the thermal deformation of the machine tool obtained by the multi-source heterogeneous information fusion method is consistent with the actual test results. As compared with the predicted performance using only temperature information, the mean square error (MSE) decreased by 0.1663 μm. Therefore, the temperature - vibration information fusion model has higher accuracy in terms of predicting the thermal deformation of the spindle system model."

The performance of these (single) algorithms were compared with that of modified ones processed through hyperparameter tuning, ensemble learning (only for machine learning), and multi-layer stacking (i.e., two layers of LSTM units).

For the model performance evaluation, discharge and biochemical oxygen demand are selected as dependent variables out of nine measured parameters. Results showed that the performance of any machine learning algorithms was superior to their competitor LSTM. This is mainly attributed to a small amount of input data provided to the LSTM algorithm and unstable effluent wastewater characteristics. Meanwhile, hyperparameter tuning improved the performance of all tested algorithms. However, ensemble learning for machine learning and two-layer stacking for LSTM generally resulted in performance degradation as compared to that of single algorithms, regardless of dependent variables.

This analysis, also, selected analysis data which consider multicollinearity among variables. Traditional regression analysis using this data was also conducted to establish a foundation for comparing the machine learning results based on the artificial neural network models.Machine learning involved setting up 1, 5, 10-layer MLP models and 1, 5, 10-layer LSTM models with one cell per layer, and the models were also classified based on whether or not an activation function was included for each layer.The training results showed that the MLP model without activation functions did not improve the efficiency level measured by MSE and MAE, even when the number of layers or training times were increased. However, the training of MLP models that include activation functions, ReLU, which can reflect nonlinearity in the learning process, showed a clear improvement in efficiency with an increase in the number of layers, training times, and input data size.In contrast, in the training of LSTM models, an increase in the number of layers and training times did not consistently show improvement in efficiency, and even when there was improvement, the impact was limited.

Simultaneously, the growing interest in machine learning has led to its increased application in hydrological studies. However, it is not yet clear whether machine learning models are more advantageous than the conventional conceptual models. In this study, we compared the performance of the conventional GR6J model with the machine learning-based Random Forest model across 38 basins in Korea using both gauged and ungauged basin prediction methods. For gauged basin predictions, each model was calibrated or trained using observed daily runoff data, and their performance was evaluted over a separate validation period. Subsequently, ungauged basin simulations were evaluated using proximity-based parameter regionalization with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV). In gauged basins, the Random Forest consistently outperformed the GR6J, exhibiting superiority across basins regardless of whether they had strong or weak rainfall-runoff correlations. This suggest that the inherent data-driven training structures of machine learning models, in contrast to the conceptual models, offer distinct advantages in data-rich scenarios. However, the advantages of the machine-learning algorithm were not replicated in ungauged basin predictions, resulting in a lower performance than that of the GR6J. In conclusion, this study suggests that while the Random Forest model showed enhanced performance in trained locations, the existing GR6J model may be a better choice for prediction in ungagued basins."

This study aims to estimate the population in 2040 at the 500m grid level by applying an explainable machine learning to Busan in order to respond to this need for a change in population estimation method. Comparing the results of population estimation by applying the explainable machine learning and the cohort component method, we found that the machine learning produces lower errors and is more applicable to estimating areas with large population changes. This is because machine learning can account for a combination of variables that are likely to affect demographic change. Overestimated population values in a declining population period are likely to cause problems in urban planning, such as inefficiency of investment and overinvestment in certain sectors, resulting in a decrease in quality in other sectors. Underestimated population values can also accelerate the shrinkage of cities and reduce the quality of life, so there is a need to develop appropriate population estimation methods and alternatives."

We analyzedpeak pressure and resonance frequency data using the Mann-Whitney test and absorbancedata using the machine learning modeling.Results The only significant difference in peak pressure and resonance frequency was ob-served in COM ears in contrast to normal ears. For absorbance data from WBT, we made 3models for machine learning to compare normal ears agaist COM, ETD, and all middle eardisorders. Models for otosclerosis ears and normal ears were impossible to analyze due to thesmall numbers of otosclerosis patients.

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that a cognitive brain response is similar to that of a native speaker for increasing proficiency in a second language. In addition, most researchers have recently focused on machine-learning approach to classifying violated sentence structures or words from language-related ERP components. This paper investigates neurocognitive process while reading grammatical and non-grammatical sentences from German to language learners whose native language is Korean. We performed experiments to classify language-related ERP components by proficiency level using machine learning methods. As a result, P600 was detected in advanced learners, but not in beginner ones. It achieved the best accuracy of 67.18% with RBF-SVM for the difference in learning level for detecting the P600 component. In conclusion, we examined language-related ERP components to identify brain responses during second language comprehension.

Method : Input factors such as leachate generation, landfill gas generation, and weather data (precipitation, wind speed, radiation, temperature, and relative humidity) were used from June 2002 to October 2018. Linear interpolation and mean method were used as the missing value handling technique. The experiment was conducted by dividing the data into train and test data according to the optimal ratio. Various single models were used, and the prediction performance of the model was compared and evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2). Result and discussion : The gated recurrent unit (GRU) model was the best among the single models. In the GRU model, R2 was 0.867 for linear interpolation and R2 was 0.839 for the mean method, so that the GRU model using linear interpolation was most suitable for predicting leachate generation. In the ANN model, R2 of linear interpolation (0.862) was higher than that of mean method (0.828). In the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, R2 was 0.779 for linear interpolation and 0.762 for mean method. In the random forest (RF) model, R2 for linear interpolation (0.700) was also higher than that for the mean method (0.665). The model performance was excellent in the order GRU > ANN > LSTM > RF. The linear interpolation for the missing value handling technique was superior to the mean method in all models used in this experiment.

Second, the three major office districts in Seoul form clusters differentiated from other areas. Third, the number of Dongs belonging to each district is smaller than the general consensus. The traditional business district (CBD) includes only parts of Jongno-Gu and Jung-Gu, the Yeouido business district (YBD) is composed of only Yeouido-Dong, and the Gangnam business district (GBD) comprises not many Dongs of Gangnam-Gu and Seocho-Gu. Fourth, by weakening the criteria, the clustering results in different spatial expansions by district. CBD has expanded to Seodaemun-Gu and Yongsan-Gu, whereas YBD has not expanded to Mapo-Gu or Yeongdeungpo. In particular, GBD expands to a considerable number of Dongs in Gangnam-Gu and Seocho-Gu. Fifth, the range of each district changes by period. When the office price increases rapidly, the range of each district is widened, and vice versa. These results show that, unlike the general perception of office districts, the CBD is expanding to Seodaemun-Gu and Yongsan-Gu. Moreover, Yeouido and nearby Mapo-Gu and Yeongdeungpo are not homogenous enough to be viewed as one district, and GBD is not linear but rectangular.

Accordingly, attempts to create business insights using user evaluation data have been actively made. However, since user evaluation can change after the user experiences the product, it is difficult to say that the analysis based only on reviews immediately after purchase fully reflects the user's evaluation of the product. Moreover, studies conducted so far on user evaluation have overlooked the fact that the length of time a user has used a product can affect the user's product evaluation. Therefore, in this study, we build a model that predicts the direction of change in the user's rating after use from the user's rating and reviews immediately after purchase. In particular, the proposed model reflects the product's period of use in predicting the change direction of the star rating. However, since the posterior information on the duration of product use cannot be used as input in the inference process, we propose a structure that utilizes information about the product's period of use using an auxiliary classifier.

The rotation system is affected by the installation location and environment, and the method using the current signal presents difficulties in sensor installation and maintenance. The method using the existing vibration signal requires an expert to define the range of rotation speed, and it is difficult to apply it to industrial sites due to the large amount of computation. In this paper, we train a CNN model that classifies the rotational speed range using STFT images. After that, a rotational speed estimation system capable of detecting periodic signals using an autocorrelation function and operating in an edge device is proposed. The data used in the study was collected from air conditioning facilities, and the performance evaluation of the model and the estimated rotation speed of the digital tachometer and the system were compared and analyzed to evaluate the system performance. Through this study, it was confirmed that the proposed system estimates the rotational speed with high accuracy and can be applied to industrial sites. As a future study, it is necessary to improve the system function so that the rotational speed can be estimated without a specific speed range."

The generated data was processed by volume reduction through down sampling and data characteristic observation via resampling techniques, including up sampling through interpolation. Subsequently, the study involved a comparative analysis of the performance of 30 machine learning models built with the down sampled data.Results and Discussion : As data acquisition interval increased (i.e., down sampling progressed), R2 decreased and RMSE increased. When using the mean value as a representation, data accuracy was high, and error loss was minimal. Utilizing the maximum value as a representation helped maintain data characteristics and reduce information loss. Simple interpolation methods did not yield improved data accuracy. Furthermore, with wider data acquisition intervals, the practical predictive performance of machine learning models decreased, and the models experienced a sharp decline in performance when data became insufficient.Conclusion : For models requiring the ability to detect changes rather than accuracy, utilizing the maximum value over a specific period proves to be effective. The measurement interval of data emerges as a significant factor affecting the performance of machine learning models, with models developed under different measurement intervals often failing to demonstrate the expected performance. In this study, we have implemented all stages of data preprocessing, classification, training, and validation using LabVIEW, confirming the potential for integrating data analysis processes into LabVIEW, a widely used platform in the fields of control and measurement."

To  effectively  manage  the  stream  sediments, identification of primary sources  of sediment  contamination and source-associated control strategies will be required. We evaluated the performance of machine learning models in identifying primary sources of sediment contamination based on the physico-chemical properties of stream sediments. A total of 356 stream sediment data sets of 18 quality parameters including 10 heavy metal species(Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, As, Zn, Cr, Hg, Li, and Al), 3 soil parameters(clay, silt, and sand fractions), and 5 water quality parameters(water content, loss on ignition,  total  organic  carbon,  total  nitrogen,  and  total  phosphorous)  were  collected  near  abandoned  metal mines and industrial complexes across the four major river basins in Korea. Two machine learning algorithms, linear  discriminant  analysis  (LDA)  and  support  vector  machine  (SVM)  classifiers  were  used  to  classify  the sediments into four cases of different combinations of the sampling period and locations (i.e., mine in dry season, mine in wet season, industrial complex in dry season, and　industrial complex in wet season). Both models showed good performance in the classification, with SVM outperformed LDA; the accuracy values of LDA  and  SVM  were  79.5%  and  88.1%,  respectively.  An  SVM  ensemble  model  was  used  for  multi-label classification of the multiple contamination sources inlcuding landuses in the upland areas within 1 km radius from the sampling sites. The results showed that the multi-label classifier was comparable performance with sinlgle-label SVM in classifying mines and industrial complexes, but was less accurate in classifying dominant land uses (50~60%). The poor performance of the multi-label SVM is likely due to the overfitting caused by small data sets compared to the complexity of the model. A larger data set might increase the performance of the machine learning models in identifying contamination sources."

Assessing and predicting concrete degradation due to thermal effects and carbonation are crucial yet intricate tasks. To address this, multiple prediction models for concrete carbonation and compressive strength under thermal impact have been developed. This study employs seven machine learning algorithms—specifically, multiple linear regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural networks, and extreme gradient boosting algorithms—to formulate predictive models for concrete carbonation and thermal impact. Two distinct datasets, derived from reported experimental studies, were utilized for training these predictive models. Performance evaluation relied on metrics like root mean square error, mean square error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination. The optimization of hyperparameters was achieved through k-fold cross-validation and grid search techniques.

The decrease in explanatory power for degrees of substitution higher than 2.0 can be attributed to the chemical reaction rate. However, by applying SVM and utilizing the kernel trick to project the data into a high-dimensional feature space and perform non-linear classification, it was possible to create a degree of substitution discrimination model with excellent performance, regardless of the degree of substitution.

Specifically, we focus on the Itaewon disaster issue that unfolded on Halloween in 2022 and analyze whether YouTube video thumbnails featuring anger, worry, and fear are associated with comments containing incivility (rudeness, hate, blaming). Short-form YouTube videos related to the Itaewon disaster were extracted for the 100-day period following the incident, and comments were randomly selected. Human coding was applied to 1,000 comments, while developed algorithms were used to identify and analyze 50,000 comments. As a result of the analysis of thumbnails containing anger emotions, there was a lot of victim blaming in the comments. However, rudeness and hate expressions were found more often in cases in which anger and worry were not included in the thumbnails. Although the found associations between emotional thumbnails and uncivil comments were somewhat mixed, the pattern of moderating effects was clear. When the thumbnail focused on individuals, especially politicians, comments blaming the victim were the most common. When the thumbnail focused on the victim, uncivil comments actually decreased. The machine learning identification analysis data was similar to the human coding results in many aspects but there was a difference in the finding that angry thumbnails had a lot of hateful comments."
기계학습을 이용한 광학 위성 영상 기반의 도시 내 수목 피복률 추정,2023,,,"Urban trees play a vital role in urban ecosystems,significantly reducing impervious surfaces and impacting carbon cycling within the city. Although previous research has demonstrated the efficacy of employing artificial intelligence in conjunction with airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to generate urban tree information, the availability and cost constraints associated with LiDAR data pose limitations. Consequently, this study employed freely accessible, high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (i.e., Sentinel-2 data) to estimate fractional tree canopy cover (FTC) within the urban confines of Suwon, South Korea, employing machine learning techniques. This study leveraged a median composite image derived from a time series of Sentinel-2 images. In order to account for the diverse land cover found in urban areas, the model incorporated three types of input variables: average (mean) and standard deviation (std) values within a 30-meter grid from 10 m resolution of optical indices from Sentinel-2, and fractional coverage for distinct land cover classes within 30 m grids from the existing level 3 land cover map. Four schemes with different combinations of input variables were compared. Notably, when all three factors (i.e., mean, std, and fractional cover) were used to consider the variation of landcover in urban areas(Scheme 4, S4), the machine learning model exhibited improved performance compared to using only the mean of optical indices (Scheme 1). Of the various models proposed, the random forest (RF) model with S4 demonstrated the most remarkable performance, achieving R<sup>2</sup> of 0.8196, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0749, and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.1022. The std variable exhibited the highest impact on model outputs within the heterogeneous land covers based on the variable importance analysis. This trained RF model with S4 was then applied to the entire Suwon region, consistently delivering robust results with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.8702, MAE of 0.0873, and RMSE of 0.1335. The FTC estimation method developed in this study is expected to offer advantages for application in various regions, providing fundamental data for a better understanding of carbon dynamics in urban ecosystems in the future."

To date, traffic safety measures have been primarily focused on reactive safety management using macroscopically aggregated traffic data collected by infrastructure-based detection systems. However, the need for proactive safety management has been raised as individual vehicle driving behavior data is now readily available. Detection of crash prone road segments allows for realizing more proactive safety management to prevent traffic crashes. This study applied statistical techniques and machine learning models based on individual vehicle data capable of analyzing driving behavior. It also aims to implement a more accurate road hazard identification model using an ensemble learning strategy. Twenty-two driving safety indicators were derived to characterize vehicle driving behavior from inter-vehicular interaction, longitudinal, and lateral perspectives, based on the data collected from PVD, which provides individual vehicle driving behavior data.Ten of these indicators, which showed significant correlation with traffic accident data, were selected through statistical correlation analysis. The average number of accidents in the analysis section of traffic accident data was used to categorize road sections into hazardous and normal categories, serving as the target variable. The ten statistically significant driving safety indicators were used as explanatory variables. Classification models such as SVM, ANN, and KNN were performed. Ensemble learning, known for enhancing robustness compared to single models, was employed by combining these three models to derive the final model. The accuracy of the model by ensemble learning strategy was 90.8%, showing an improvement of up to 4.8% and at least 2.7% compared to single models. This indicates that ensemble learning strategies can enable more accurate implementation of road hazard identification models for proactive traffic safety management. The methodology of this study is expected to serve as foundational data for implementing models for real-time crash prone road segments identification in environments where real-time data collection and utilization are feasible."

So this study attempted to find a way to improve the team's scoring ability by increasing the efficiency of the batting order. Methods By applying team statistics (on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS:on-base percentage plus slugging percentage) and batting order statistics (on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS) to machine learning regression models as independent variables, we create a ""team score prediction model"" that predicts team scores more accurately. We used this model and checked the team's scoring ability changes while changing the batting order according to the correlation, the team score and each batting order's ""On Base Plus Slugging"". Result It was confirmed that changing the batting order based on the correlation between the team score and each batting order's ""On Base Plus Slugging"" could increase the team's scoring ability. Conclusion Applying batting order statistics along with team statistics to machine learning regression models can more accurately predict team scores, and adjusting the batting order based on the correlation between the team score and each batting order's ""On Base Plus Slugging"" can improve a team's scoring ability."

In order to develop a high-performance lithium-ion battery, it is necessary to manufacture the battery and measure its performance while varying the cathode material ratio. However, it takes a lot of time and money to directly develop batteries and measure their performance for all combinations of variables. Therefore, research to predict the performance of a battery using an artificial intelligence model has been actively conducted. However, since measurement experiments were conducted with the same battery in the existing published battery data, the cathode material combination ratio was fixed and was not included as a data attribute.

We analyzed the factors that can affect the performance of lithium-ion batteries and defined the mass of each cathode material and battery usage environment (cycle, current, temperature, time) as input data and the battery power and capacity as target data.

This study aims to develop a high-resolution (10 m) model for classifying riverside land cover by integrating Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and terrestrial characteristics using machine learning algorithms. We constructed a total of 3,284 landcover reference point datasets near the four major rivers of South Korea with five classes: water, barren, grass, forest, and built-up. The Random Forest and Light Gradient Boosting Machine classification models were developed using eight input variables derived from SAR signal and digital terrain data. The models showed an overall cross-validation accuracy exceeding 80% while maintaining consistent spatial distributions, except for the barren class. The false alarms on barren would be corrected through additional sampling processes and incorporating optical characteristics in further study. The high-resolution riverside land cover maps are expected to contribute to the establishment of a comprehensive management system for water resources such as riverside land cover change detection, river ecosystem monitoring, and flood hazard management.

Initially, CO2 concentration was predicted based on a basic dataset comprising the day of the week, time, temperature, and indoor CO2 levels. Subsequently, a more comprehensive dataset, incorporating ventilation system operation counts and natural ventilation presence, was employed for predictions.Machine learning and deep learning models such as ANN, DNN, LSTM, KNN, and LGBM were trained using these datasets, and their predictive performance was compared across different areas of the residence, namely bedrooms, living rooms, and corridors. The findings demonstrate that even using the basic dataset alone, it is possible to predict CO2 levels in residential buildings with a high degree of confidence. These results are expected to contribute to the development of future algorithms for operating next-generation mechanical ventilation systems that aim to minimize energy consumption while maintaining a clean indoor environment.This paper is anticipated to increase interest and understanding in environmentally conscious indoor environmental control systems and offer essential research insights for the advancement of building systems and environmental technology in the future."

In this study, based on data provided by AFLOW (Automatic-FLOW for Materials Discovery), the bandgap of a semiconductor material was predicted using only the material’s compositional features. The compositional features were generated using the python module of ‘Pymatgen’ and ‘Matminer’. Pearson’s correlation coefficients (PCC) between the compositional features were calculated and those with a correlation coefficient value larger than 0.95 were removed in order to avoid overfitting. The bandgap prediction performance was compared using the metrics of R2 score and root-mean-squared error. By predicting the bandgap with randomforest and xgboost as representatives of the ensemble algorithm, it was found that xgboost gave better results after cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning. To investigate the effect of compositional feature selection on the bandgap prediction of the machine learning model, the prediction performance was studied according to the number of features based on feature importance methods. It was found that there were no significant changes in prediction performance beyond the appropriate feature. Furthermore, artificial neural networks were employed to compare the prediction performance by adjusting the number of features guided by the PCC values, resulting in the best R2 score of 0.811. By comparing and analyzing the bandgap distribution and prediction performance according to the material group containing specific elements (F, N, Yb, Eu, Zn, B, Si, Ge, Fe Al), various information for material design was obtained."

However, renewable energy is intermittent and variable so it is difficult to predict the produced electrical energy from a renewable energy source. In this study, digital-twin concept is applied to solve difficulties in predicting electrical energy from a renewable energy source. Considering that rotation of wind turbine has high correlation with produced electrical energy, a model which simulates rotation in the drivetrain of a wind turbine is developed. The base of a drivetrain simulation model is set with well-known state equation in mechanical engineering, which simulates the rotating system. Simulation based machine learning is conducted to get unknown parameters which are not provided by manufacturer. The simulation is repeated and parameters in simulation model are corrected after each simulation by optimization algorithm. The trained simulation model is validated with 27 real wind turbine operation data set. The simulation model shows 4.41% error in average compared to real wind turbine operation data set. Finally, it is assessed that the drivetrain simulation model represents the real wind turbine drivetrain system well. It is expected that wind-energy-prediction accuracy would be improved as wind turbine digital twin including the developed drivetrain simulation model is applied."

The XGBoost machine learning technique, coupled with data from the Household Travel Survey, was used to evaluate the effect of factors such as housing price, attributes of residential and workplace locales, and individual parameters on commuting time. The goal is to highlight the key influences on commuting time for each income stratum. The findings underscore a compensatory relationship between housing prices and commuting time across all income classes. In addition, workplace proximity and access to public transportation emerged as cardinal determinants of commuting duration for low-income earners. For individuals in the middle- and high-income brackets, however, the quality of the residential setting assumes greater importance in shaping commuting time. The results prompted the recommendation of cost-effective housing near employment nodes as an effective strategy for reducing commuting durations across all income categories. It is important to note that providing such affordable housing near public transportation appears more pivotal for low-income earners. For middle- and high-income earners, the improvement of the residential milieu proximity to workplaces is critical in curtailing commuting duration."

And since each batter receives equal opportunities to bat, it is impossible to funnel more offensive opportunities into a standout player. Therefore, player composition is particularly important. In this study, we checked whether the batter composition information could be usefully used to predict team runs more accurately. Players were given a grade for each evaluation index based on individual evaluation indicators. Such as batting average(AVG), on-base percentage(OBP), slugging percentage(SLG), OPS(On-Base Plus Slugging), wOBA(Weighted On Base Average), wRC+(Weighted Runs Created), and the player distribution information for each grade was used to predict team runs. As a result of the experiment, it was confirmed that the team runs were predicted more accurately if we used the player distribution information by grade with team's batting statistics than used only team's batting statistics. The method proposed in this study considers the number of players in each grade to predict the team's scoring ability.

The random forest model demonstrated excellent performance in carbonyl content prediction, surpassing the results obtained from the partial least squares model. To optimize the infrared spectral range for prediction, the spectral range was restricted from the entire range of 4000-400 cm-1 to the narrower range of 1800-1200 cm-1, known for its suitability in characterizing paper properties. This limitation enhanced the coefficients of determination of the model, increasing it from 0.921 to 0.937. A permutation variable importance measure was then applied to identify the key spectral regions contributing to carbonyl content prediction. The analysis pinpointed the 1650-1350 cm-1 range as a crucial region for accurate predictions.Subsequently, a new prediction model was built using data exclusively from this important region, yielding remarkably improved coefficients of determination of 0.960 and 0.965 for the raw and second derivative spectra, respectively. These findings affirm the validity and significance of the critical region identified by the permutation variable importance measure.

This research employed a multiple case study method, grounded in inductive learning, to analyze the commercial successes and failures of these cosmetics subscription services. In this research, we identified several key factors influencing the success or failure of cosmetics subscription services. These factors include the 'subscription price range', the 'presence of versioning', the 'integration of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) values', the 'availability of customized services', the 'inclusion of expert recommendations', and the 'complexity of product composition'. We analyzed 20 commercialized cosmetics subscription services, comprising 12 successful and 8 failed cases, from 2008 to April 30, 2023, using the six identified variables. By employing an inductive learning approach based on the ID3 algorithm, a machine learning methodology within the field of artificial intelligence, our analysis revealed that 'existence of ESG value' emerged as the most influential factor among the six variables. This was followed by 'subscription price range', with 'existence of expert recommendation' also identified as a significant variable. Based on these findings, we propose four hypotheses concerning the success and failure of cosmetics subscription services. The hypotheses are as follows: 1) Cosmetic subscription services that lack ESG factors are likely to fail. 2) Services with ESG factors but without expert recommendations tend to fail, especially when priced in the mid-range. 3) Cosmetic subscription services that offer expert recommendations, along with the presence of ESG factors and mid-range pricing, are likely to succeed. 4) Services incorporating ESG factors tend to be successful when adopting either a high or low pricing strategy.

Various prediction models based on machine learning have been developed in the past; however, these models, relying solely on pattern analysis and outdoor temperature, may not guarantee high prediction accuracy. In this study, we developed three categories of heat consumption prediction models for district heating in residential buildings based on various independent variables. First, we collected data on heat consumption in residential buildings and used it as the dependent variable. In terms of the independent variables, we developed three models: model A, which focused on outdoor temperature; model B, which included various climatic factors; and model C, which added holiday and season to the climatic factors. We evaluated the prediction performance of these models. The R2 values of models C, B, and A were 0.8144, 0.7814, and 0.7596, respectively."

This is because the range of price fluctuations due to various environmental variables is significantly different from previous stock price prediction studies. Existing studies to predict the price of cryptocurrency are mainly studies that directly predict the price through time series analysis, and the accuracy is not high, especially in the crash market, the prediction accuracy is remarkably low.  This study proposes a machine learning model that applies a robo-advisor type algorithm that determines price graph trends rather than cryptocurrency prices.

The triple barrier method is applied to the Bollinger Bands, and the meta-labeling is applied to the KNN algorithm to generate a predictive model. The accuracy of the proposed prediction model is 0.768, and it has obtained relatively stable profits in rising markets and shows very good performance in defending profitability in falling markets.

GOCI-II 대기상한 반사도와 기계학습을 이용한 남한 지역 시간별 에어로졸 광학 두께 산출,2023,,,"Atmospheric aerosols not only have adverse effects on human health but also exert direct and indirect impacts on the climate system. Consequently, it is imperative to comprehend the characteristics and spatiotemporal distribution of aerosols. Numerous research endeavors have been undertaken to monitor aerosols, predominantly through the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) via satellite-based observations. Nonetheless, this approach primarily relies on a look-up table-based inversion algorithm, characterized by computationally intensive operations and associated uncertainties. In this study, a novel high-resolution AOD direct retrieval algorithm, leveraging machine learning, was developed using top-of-atmosphere reflectance data derived from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager-II (GOCI-II), in conjunction with their differences from the past 30-day minimum reflectance, and meteorological variables from numerical models. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) technique was harnessed, and the resultant estimates underwent rigorous validation encompassing random, temporal, and spatial N-fold cross-validation (CV) using ground-based observation data from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD. The three CV results consistently demonstrated robust performance, yielding R<sup>2</sup>=0.70-0.80, RMSE=0.08-0.09, and within the expected error (EE) of 75.2-85.1%. The Shapley Additive exPlanations(SHAP) analysis confirmed the substantial influence of reflectance-related variables on AOD estimation. A comprehensive examination of the spatiotemporal distribution of AOD in Seoul and Ulsan revealed that the developed LGBM model yielded results that are in close concordance with AERONET AOD over time, thereby confirming its suitability for AOD retrieval at high spatiotemporal resolution (i.e., hourly, 250 m). Furthermore, upon comparing data coverage, it was ascertained that the LGBM model enhanced data retrieval frequency by approximately 8.8% in comparison to the GOCI-II L2 AOD products, ameliorating issues associated with excessive masking over very illuminated surfaces that are often encountered in physics-based AOD retrieval processes."

This study gathered qualitative data using a questionnaire to 173 students at a high school located in Seoul. The survey questions included students’ use of MT and their degree of satisfaction. Also, students’ level of expectations and affective aspects were asked in the questionnaire. Findings show that most students who responded to the survey used MT to search for the meaning of unknown English words and to translate L1 sentences into English ones. While anxiety level caused by L2 learning was reported to be lowered, whether the level of learning interest and accomplishment was increased or not remained uncertain.

Next, four categories were set as factors to analyze the inappropriateness selected: ‘explicitness’(explicit/implicit), ‘context’ (positive/negative), ‘domain’ and ‘intensity’(strong/weak). In particular, determining the intensity of inappropriateness is vital in that the need and utilization of it are high in the industry.

A vast amount of parallel corpus consisting of pairs of source and target languages is required to perform machine translation tasks successfully.

Although the quality of machine translation training data is a crucial factor directly affecting the performance of translation models, discussions on the quality of machine translation training data have not been addressed sufficiently so far. In this study, therefore, we propose a method to improve the quality of machine translation training data using deep learning-based vector alignment techniques. Specifically, we train a deep learning-based vector alignment model to convert English sentence vectors to Korean sentence vectors using high-quality Korean-English data, align the English sentence vectors of newly given Korean-English data to the Korean vector space using the trained model, and remove the ones with the low similarity between the aligned vectors and Korean sentence vectors as noise.

In this context, many studies have been conducted to reduce the computation time of black box optimization problems by predicting the quality of solutions by creating surrogate models with machine learning algorithms such as gaussian process and support vector regression. In this study, we compared the difference in approximate performance of machine learning according to the type of learning model, the amount of training data, and the sampling method of training data in binary, permutational, real, and periodic- function encodings. Therefore, the simpler the problem is, the better the performance of the gaussian process is, also, the larger the number of training data is, the better the approximation performance is, The results showed that unbiased training through sampling is advantageous for high performance. Based on these results, experiments were performed by replacing the fitness function of the genetic algorithm with a machine-learning model on binary, permutation, and real number encoding. When the machine learning approximation was well done, on average, the performance of genetic algorithms with surrogate models was slightly lower or similar to that of genetic algorithms without surrogate models. In rare cases, it showed better performance, such as finding an optimal solution within about 1.6 times fewer generations, or finding an optimal solution with a higher fit than the genetic algorithm that dose not use a surrogate model."

Himawari-8 정지궤도 위성 영상을 활용한 딥러닝 기반 산불 탐지의 효율적 방안 제시,2023,,,"As wildfires are difficult to predict, real-time monitoring is crucial for a timely response. Geostationary satellite images are very useful for active fire detection because they can monitor a vast area with high temporal resolution (e.g., 2 min). Existing satellite-based active fire detection algorithms detect thermal outliers using threshold values based on the statistical analysis of brightness temperature. However, the difficulty in establishing suitable thresholds for such threshold-based methods hinders their ability to detect fires with low intensity and achieve generalized performance. In light of these challenges, machine learning has emerged as a potential-solution. Until now, relatively simple techniques such as random forest, Vanilla convolutional neural network (CNN), and U-net have been applied for active fire detection. Therefore, this study proposed an active fire detection algorithm using state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning techniques using data from the Advanced Himawari Imager and evaluated it over East Asia and Australia. The SOTA model was developed by applying EfficientNet and lion optimizer, and the results were compared with the model using the Vanilla CNN structure. EfficientNet outperformed CNN with F1-scores of 0.88 and 0.83 in East Asia and Australia, respectively. The performance was better after using weighted loss, equal sampling, and image augmentation techniques to fix data imbalance issues compared to before the techniques were used, resulting in F1-scores of 0.92 in East Asia and 0.84 in Australia. It is anticipated that timely responses facilitated by the SOTA deep learning-based approach for active fire detection will effectively mitigate the damage caused by wildfires."

In this paper, we present a RL experiment applied to temperature control of a chamber for ultra-precision machines. The RL agent was built in Python and PyTorch framework using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm and its action commands were sent to National Instruments (NI) hardware, which ran C codes with a sampling rate of 1 Hz. For communication between the agent and the NI data acquisition unit, a data pipeline was constructed from the subprocess module and Popen class.

The absence of data in the near-offset region hinders accurate seismic imaging. Therefore, reconstructing the missing near-offset information is crucial for mitigating the influence of seismic multiples, particularly in the case of offshore surveys where the impact of multiple reflections is relatively more pronounced.Conventionally, various interpolation methods based on the Radon transform have been proposed to address the issue of the near- offset data gap. However, these methods have several limitations, leading to the recent emergence of deep-learning (DL)-based approaches as alternatives. In this study, we conducted an in-depth analysis of two representative DL-based studies to scrutinize the challenges that future studies on near-offset interpolation must address. Furthermore, through field data experiments, we precisely analyze the limitations encountered when applying previous DL-based trace interpolation techniques to near-offset situations.

For this reason, oral health has become a key component of public health, from infants to the elderly. The foundation of good oral health is good brushing habits. However, the recommended correct brushing method is not easy to adopt, and this harms oral health. This paper proposes a method to distinguish brushing zones using low-cost IMU sensors to track the correct brushing method. We evaluated the accuracy of the brushing zone estimation method using clustering algorithms in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a method for determining the brushing area based on toothbrush posture alone using the gyro sensor of an IMU sensor. In this paper, we propose a method for determining the brushing area using only the gyro sensor of an IMU sensor based on toothbrush posture. We showed that relatively inexpensive 6-axis IMU gyro sensor data could be used to estimate the user’s brushing area with an accuracy of 80.6%. In addition, we applied a clustering algorithm to these data and trained a logistic regression model using the clustered data to estimate the brushing area. The result was obtained with an accuracy of 86.7%, showing that clustering was effective and that the toothbrush posture-based brushing area estimation proposed in this paper was effective. In conclusion, it is expected that the brushing zone estimation algorithm can be implemented as a function of a relatively low-cost toothbrush and that it can help to maintain oral health by analyzing and improving personal brushing habits."

Therefore, many researchers study edge computing in the IoT, and autonomous driving is a representative application. In indoor self-driving, unlike outdoor, GPS and traffic information cannot be used, so the surrounding environment must be recognized using sensors. An efficient autonomous driving system is required because it is a mobile environment with resource constraints. This paper proposes a machine-learning method using neural networks for autonomous driving in an indoor environment. The neural network model predicts the most appropriate driving command for the current location based on the distance data measured by the LiDAR sensor. We designed six learning models to evaluate according to the number of input data of the proposed neural networks. In addition, we made an autonomous vehicle based on Raspberry Pi for driving and learning and an indoor driving track produced for collecting data and evaluation. Finally, we compared six neural network models in terms of accuracy, response time, and battery consumption, and the effect of the number of input data on performance was confirmed."

However the intuitive and empathic intelligence of artificial intelligence has not yet fully permeated service robots and surpassed humans. Therefore it can be said that it is difficult for robots to perform complex services independently and robots and humans must reinforce each other to provide quality services to customers. Recently HRI a convergence technology for natural communication between humans and robots and smooth interaction are attracting attention. HRI research can be divided into user-centered and robot-centered interactions. The robot-vision technology recognizes the environment and objects, recognizes a human face to identify a target, recognizes emotions and plays the role of a recognition unit that can infer intentions based on motion. Robots are now so widespread that humans consider them to be their colleagues and friends. Therefore, there is a need for a small robot incorporating object recognition technology. In this paper, we propose an HRI vision object recognition system using a transfer learning-based object detection algorithm in a small PC of a humanoid robot. The proposed system applies robot vision technology that can replace the visual functions of low-spec small humanoid robots and allows the humanoid robot to perform pre-programmed motions through face recognition."

Meanwhile, research on edge AI, which performs machine learning near the data source instead of the cloud, is actively conducted for reasons such as data confidentiality and privacy, response time, and cost. One such research area involves performing various audio AI applications using audio data collected from multiple IoT devices in an IoT edge computing environment. However, in most studies, IoT devices only perform sensing data transmission to the edge server, and all processes, including data preprocessing, are performed on the edge server. In this case, it not only leads to overload issues on the edge server but also causes network congestion by transmitting unnecessary data for learning. On the other way, if data preprocessing is delegated to each IoT device to address this issue, it leads to another problem of increased blackout time due to energy shortages in the devices. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the problem of increased blackout time in devices while mitigating issues in server-centric edge AI environments by determining where the data preprocessed based on the energy state of each IoT device. In the proposed method, IoT devices only perform the preprocessing process, which includes sound discrimination and noise removal, and transmit to the server if there is more energy available than the energy threshold required for the basic operation of the device."

In this context, we investigated the rhythm of Modern Sijo in relation to interactive artificial intelligence ChatGPT and Google Bard.As a result of asking ChatGPT and Google Bard various questions related to the rhythm theory of Sijo, we identified the following problems related to this subject: (1) the Sijo consists of 45 syllables; (2) the difference between the three-line poem and the three-line poem is that the Sijo can only be explained as a “twist, surfacing turn of events” of the general; (3) unlike the acrostic poem, the Sijo consists of six districts, and a clear definition of the district’s boundaries is needed. Three are the main factors by which the Sijo differs from the acrostic poem: it is “composed of about 45 syllables, dramatic contrast of the bell, and six phrases.” In addition, until now, ChatGPT and Google Bard have managed to match 45 syllables and realize the dramatic contrast (reversal) of the last line. Although it is currently impossible for these technologies to divide the Sijo into six phrases, this is also likely if learned. Accordingly, for AI to fully implement the Sijo, the following conditions of the Sijo rhythm must be clearly presented: (1) Sijo is not an acrostic poem but a three-chapter composition, and each chapter has a “specific” role; (2) Sijo is divided into two districts in each chapter, and the district is divided according to “specific” criteria; (3) each note (bar) of the Sijo has a “specific” combination, such as a three-syllable, four-syllable, and five-syllable or more notes (bar); (4) Sijo must have a “specific” rule, with three syllables for the first syllable of the bell and five or more syllables for the next syllable; (5) the segments of the lines and kites of the Sijo are free but cannot be unconditionally segmented; they must be segmented into “specific” node units.If the art machine AI can imitate the Sijo like a human, the Sijo must meet the above five conditions by itself. If these five conditions are still under discussion and unclear, it will be difficult for the art machine AI to write the progenitor that we think is common. Therefore, it is hoped that the uncertainty of the theory of the Sijo rhythm will be resolved, to some extent, through various future discussions."

Translators increase the utilization of language and play a role as cultural propagators. Machine translation is much lower wavelength. The right to the translation, which is the result of translation, should be considered to belong to the user who used the machine translation service as a tool, not to the business operator that provides the machine translation service. However, machine translation is only a simple reproduction, not the creation of a secondary work called the right to translate. This is because the machine translation process has no room for the user's creative contribution to the translation, independent of the original work's creative performance. Therefore, since machine translation is only a conversion of language, not a secondary work creation act, machine translation in which permission is granted is a reproduction under the Copyright Act and violates the copyright holder's right to reproduce. However, users may be directly liable for infringement, but there is a high possibility that they will be exempted in accordance with the private replication regulations. Therefore, it is questionable whether it is reasonable to hold the online service provider (OSP) legally responsible even though the user is exempted as a regular offender. Therefore, I think it is reasonable to indemnify the translation service provider in consideration of the public interest of the translation service as to whether the copyright holder violates the right to reproduce. The problem is that the current OSP exemption regulations are difficult to apply to online service providers that provide machine translation. This is because it is questionable whether the translation service meets the type of OSP exemption regulations. Therefore, online service providers that provide machine translation are bound to be responsible for infringement, so it is necessary to review whether the translation service can be exempted in accordance with the fair use regulations. In conclusion, the conclusion made after reviewing the utility that users can obtain through translation compared to the transaction cost of obtaining permission from the right holder for the public interest provided by the translation service is highly likely to be exempted. However, for the social contribution of translation service providers and the legal stability of online service providers accordingly, I would like to propose a legislative proposal that includes a new type of OSP exemption in the form of general provisions. Separately, it is necessary to clarify the rights relationship of important machine translation such as universal services in the intelligent information society through in-depth research or policy review on machine translation such as translation quality. In the future, when a generative AI model, such as ChatGPT, directly translates as a policy task that may appear in the machine translation process, it is necessary to specifically discuss matters such as attribution of the rights of translation data(or translation memory)."

The following were the main findings of the comparison of their predictive abilities. First, the traditional regression model is somewhat low in coefficient of determinant. Second, the decision tree models predicts the satisfaction effect of classics reading classes better than the traditional regression model. Third, when we predict the learning effects of classics reading lessons, the support vector machine models show the high predictive power with the high coefficients of determination and low RMSE. Fourth, when we predict the learning effects of classics reading lessons, the deep neural network models also show the higher predictive power with appropriate epochs and batch sizes. Thus, since the machine learning and deep learning models can predict the satisfaction of classics reading classes more accurately, we need to adopt the machine learning and deep learning models to predict the satisfaction of classics reading classes using the learning variables."

Unlike past methods, NMT (Neural Network Machine Translation) employs deep-learning methods. Thus, translation quality hinges on the amount of data in NMT. As translation quality will increase with the accumulation of data, artificial NMT is expected to continue improving at a fairly rapid pace. Compared to other language pairs, the Korean-Japanese pair often produces high quality translations since the two languages have quite similar syntactic structures and Chinese characters. Today, Artificial Intelligence identifies the context of the original text and draws appropriate expressions from accumulated corpus data.This study stemmed from the question of 'When translating synonyms, can MT (Machine Translation) recognize a situation and context and select appropriate expressions among synonyms?' The dictionary definition of synonyms is 'words with similar meaning', and even if the meanings are almost the same or similar, each word must be clearly distinguished according to the situation or context. When human translation is performed, professional translators are capable of selecting appropriate words suitable for the context and situation. Although translation quality has improved significantly due to the NMT, this paper aims to verify the ability of the machine to accurately recognize the situation and context in which the word is used. In this paper, by using a neural machine translation program, Naver's Papago, to translate six pairs of representative synonyms (Japanese) in both directions of Korean-Japanese and Japanese-Korean, we have confirmed that the neural machine translation system can recognize some degree of scenes and contexts through words in a sentence and lead to appropriate lexical selection."

The analysis draws from the translations and commentaries of twenty-six undergraduate students during the fall semester of 2022. The results demonstrate that although machine translation is not always accurate and readable, the students were still able to learn from it. They used machine translation as peer feedback to selectively choose expressions and explore different options, which led to enhanced metalinguistic awareness. This helped them to use more authentic and contextualized expressions and improve grammatical accuracy. Using machine translation also served to lower student anxiety and establish a more nonthreatening learning environment. In this regard, machine translation can enhance Korean-into-English translation for undergraduate students in both the product and process."

Metalanguage helps learners to learn foreign languages by activating the metalanguage knowledge they have about their native language and their ability to explain specific language phenomena or translation problems. Unlike the previous undergraduate machine translation education research focused on post-editing, this study attempts to use machine translation as a tool for translation learning with the purpose of promoting understanding and knowledge of translation and explaining theoretical approaches to translation problems. Using the machine translation result of the novel Pachinko, students conducted the following learning activities with “Translation Problem Judgment Tests”: 1) Understand the translation problems, 2) Indicate the translation problems, and 3) Explain and correct the translation problems. The analysis found that although the use of metalanguage was active, there was a case where the translation problem was not accurately identified and analyzed. This meant that the two sub-categories of explicit knowledge, metalanguage and analyzed knowledge, were not highly correlated. On the other hand, the higher the frequency of using the metalanguage, the higher the explicit knowledge needed to explain the translation problem. Taken together, these results suggest that meta-linguistic education enhances students' awareness of translation and ultimately helps expand explicit knowledge. The findings of this research have significant implications because they show that metalanguage learning activities using machine translation in undergraduate translation education can help students increase their explicit knowledge of translation and extend their analytical skills."

It is a practical and applicable learning approach in numerous industrial domains for the reason that the features of a data sample are partitioned into the number of clients. General vertical federated learning is a decentralized machine learning approach that assumes a single entity maintaining all label information of datasets. However, this assumption is not practical and realizable in real-world settings, where distributed labels can be obtained by multiple clients. In this paper, we propose a secure cascade vertical federated learning framework that utilizes homomorphic encryption schemes to preserve data privacy, especially in scenarios where the server or the label owning party may act as an adversary. Considering that a client with partitioned labels and features is possible to infer the label information from the other clients with the bottom model by the recent work of Fu et al., our work aims to provide security against passive label inference attack. With Paillier cryptosystem and a public key encryption, the clients along with the central server are not able to identify each computed result, which eventually contributes to various industries."

The current ship collision alert uses a supervised learning (SL) model with survey labels based on large ship-oriented data and its operators. Consequently, the small ship data and the operator's opinion are not reflected in the current collision-supervised learning model, and the effect is insufficient because the alarm is provided from a longer distance than the small ship operator feels. In addition, the supervised learning (SL) method requires a large number of labeled data, and the labeling process requires a lot of resources and time. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, the classification model of collision alerts for small ships using unlabeled data with the semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms (Label Propagation and TabNet) was studied. Results of real-time experiments on small ship operators using the classification model of collision alerts showed that the satisfaction of operators increased."

The proposed algorithm has adapted two methods: a policy network method, based on Transformer to compute the correlation between individual jobs and machines, and another method to train the network with a reinforcement learning algorithm based on the REINFORCE with Baseline algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on randomly generated problems and the results were compared with those obtained using CPLEX, as well as three scheduling algorithms.

Machine learning, which is the basis of AI, uses statistical and logical algorithms of mathematics to learn, analyze and predict using massive amounts of various data. Batting ability(of baseball) is one of the most important one for a baseball player. In particular, among the statistical data of batting average, slugging percentage, and OPS(On-base Plus Slugging) are the most important criteria for a baseball-fielder. The run-scoring ability is to run the base after hitting the ball, that is determined by the baseball player's speed, agility and baseball wits. In addition, defensive ability is the one to catch and throw the ball in the case of a in-fielder or out-fielder. Defensive ability is determined by a baseball player's dexterity, accuracy and judgment. In addition, teamwork minds are important because baseball is a team sport. Theses are determined by a baseball player's coordination, communication and leadership.

Normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, lead area index, and land surface temperature were employed in this study as input data for the yield model. Crop yields can be effectively predicted using satellite images because satellites collect continuous spatiotemporal data on the global environment. Based on the model developed previous study, a model designed for input data was proposed in this study. Using time series satellite images, convolutional neural network, a deep learning model, was used to predict crop yield. Landsat 8 provides images every 16 days, but it is difficult to acquire images especially in summer due to the influence of weather such as clouds. As a result, yield prediction was conducted by splitting June to July into one part and August to September into two. Yield prediction was performed using a machine learning approach and reference models , and modeling performance was compared.

In particular, the long short term memory(LSTM) algorithm and the gated recurrent unit(GRU) algorithm, which are one of the neural network analyses, are used and an autoregressive mixed data sampling model is added to explain the structure of each factor. And the TF-IDF methodology is used to quantify economics news which is unstructured data. As a result of the analysis, LSTM is superior in terms of predictive power, but it has a disadvantage that it is difficult to understand the factors because they are treated as a black box. By the way, as a result of estimating by the AR-MIDAS method, it is found that as the industrial production index at t increases and the unemployment rate decreases at t-1, the gross domestic product at t improves. It is also found that economic news in the first month of the quarter had a negative impact on the economy, while economic news in the second month had a positive impact on quarterly GDP. As such, this study shortened the prediction cycle compared to the GDP nowcasting model to improve the timeliness of GDP prediction, and used online economic news data to immediately reflect it in GDP prediction in the event of a sudden event."

In this context, Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) systems play a pivotal role in addressing diverse information needs of users. A KBQA system provides answers to user queries based on information stored in a Knowledge Base (KB). The typical pipeline of a standard KBQA system involves processing the natural language input, performing Entity linking to identify and link entities to their corresponding entries in the Knowledge Base, and subsequently generating a Logical Form. However, an extended domain of KBQA, known as Geographic Information-Based Question Answering (GeoKBQA), transforms spatially related queries into Logical Forms without the process of Entity linking. This research proposes a novel methodology to incorporate Entity linking in GeoKBQA to overcome such limitations. For this endeavor, deep learning models namely BERT, RoBERTa, and ChatGPT were utilized to carry out the initial process of Entity linking, which is Mention Detection (MD). Specifically, the BERT and RoBERTa models were fine-tuned with the NLMAPS dataset, comprised of geographic queries, for the specialized MD task concerning geographic inquiries. Conversely, ChatGPT employed a Few-shot prompting approach to perform MD. Experimental results indicated that the fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa models achieved an F1 score of 0.96 and 0.97, while the ChatGPT model recorded an F1 score of 0.99."

In this study, we propose a machine learning model that predicts the relative performance of fixed income funds one month out in order to help investors make portfolio choices. To verify the predictive power, we build a random forest model using performance data on fixed income funds from December 1, 2017, to January 31, 2023, as well as macro indicator data such as government bond interest rates, the won-to-US-dollar exchange rate, the domestic growth rate, and the consumer price index.

Second, prediction power increases when characteristics are selected using BorutaPy, and third, cross-validation confirms the stability of the model. While most previous academic studies directly predict the price and return on investment from individual financial instruments, this study utilizes a classifier to guide the selection of relatively good performance groups. In this respect, it differs from previous studies. Therefore, this study is expected to indirectly help investors make investment decisions about fixed income funds.

The CTR represents the probability of a user clicking on a displayed advertisement. Recently, CTR prediction models, such as DeepFM, have been proposed to learn both low- and high-order feature interactions. However, these models may suffer from performance degradation as they do not consider the concept drift of the click data generated in real-time. Concept drift is a phenomenon where the statistical properties of data change over time.

As a result, rather than predicting only the ultimate capacity of structures, the prediction of performances on structures depending on different damage states or various accident scenarios have increasingly needed. This study aims to develop machine-learning models predicting drifts of the RC shear walls according to the damage limit states. The damage limit states are divided into four categories: the onset of cracking, yielding of rebars, crushing of concrete, and structural failure. The data on the drift of shear walls at each damage state are collected from the existing studies, and four regression machine-learning models are used to train the datasets. In addition, the bagging ensemble method is applied to improve the accuracy of the individual machine-learning models.

The specific BPT temperature deviation increases if the combustion is unstable. However, at the beginning of the failure, the operator may be unaware of the failure. This is because the deviation increases in the lower-temperature range than the alarm value.

While promoting the development of artificial intelligence technology, it is required to design norms that serve as guidelines and safety devices so that future risks can be prevented and society can enjoy the benefits of artificial intelligence technology development evenly.The establishment of norms for artificial intelligence needs to develop in three directions. First, it is necessary to set and share the values and principles that the nation and society as a whole should pursue. The three principles of AI ethical standards established at the end of 2020 need to be refined into specific practical principles according to the 10 key requirements, and it is desirable to base them on the principles and fundamental rights of the Constitution.Second, preliminary regulations are needed to prevent artificial intelligence from infringing human rights and dignity in public areas. Systems that may cause harm to the body or mind and real-time monitoring systems through facial recognition should be prohibited. Artificial intelligence is useful for benefit administration or crime prevention, but excessive personal information collection, monitoring, and control should be avoided. For automated decision-making systems, the data and algorithms should be checked by humans and notification and explanation to users and the right to opt-out should be legislated.Lastly, the use of copyrighted works for machine learning in the private sector must be legislated as fair use, and the use of disclosed personal information must be allowed without prior consent. Through the introduction of non-identification technology, a legal system that allows data to be utilized without conflicting with personal information protection must be established. Public data, such as court judgments, should be open to the private sector in a usable form. Legislation should be prepared to establish a data ecosystem that allows companies to share, trade, and exchange de-identified data, but it is necessary to prepare measures to prevent illegal activities such as re-identification."
Performance Evaluation of a Feature-Importance-based Feature Selection Method for Time Series Prediction,2023,"['Feature importance', 'Feature selection', 'LIME', 'Time series prediction']",,"Various machine-learning models may yield high predictive power for massive time series for time series prediction. However, these models are prone to instability in terms of computational cost because of the high dimensionality of the feature space and nonoptimized hyperparameter settings. Considering the potential risk that model training with a high-dimensional feature set can be time-consuming, we evaluate a feature-importance-based feature selection method to derive a tradeoff between predictive power and computational cost for time series prediction. We used two machine learning techniques for performance evaluation to generate prediction models from a retail sales dataset. First, we ranked the features using impurity- and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) -based feature importance measures in the prediction models. Then, the recursive feature elimination method was applied to eliminate unimportant features sequentially. Consequently, we obtained a subset of features that could lead to reduced model training time while preserving acceptable model performance."

In this study, we aim to enhance the performance of OpenAI’s Whisper model, a multilingual ASR system on the Korean language. Whisper was pretrained on a large corpus (around 680,000 hours) of web speech data and has demonstrated strong recognition performance for major languages.However, it faces challenges in recognizing languages such as Korean, which is not major language while training.We address this issue by fine-tuning the Whisper model with an additional dataset comprising about 1,000 hours of Korean speech. We also compare its performance against a Transformer model that was trained from scratch using the same dataset. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the Whisper model significantly improved its Korean speech recognition capabilities in terms of character error rate (CER). Specifically, the performance improved with increasing model size.However, the Whisper model’s performance on English deteriorated post fine-tuning, emphasizing the need for further research to develop robust multilingual models. Our study demonstrates the potential of utilizing a fine-tuned Whisper model for Korean ASR applications. Future work will focus on multilingual recognition and optimization for real-time inference."
Fault diagnosis of rolling bearings using unsupervised dynamic time warping-aided artificial immune system,2023,"['Novelty detection', 'AIS', 'DTW', 'bearing fault', 'vibrations.']",,"Rotating machines heavily rely on an intricate network of interconnected sub-components, with bearing failures accounting for a substantial proportion (40$\%$ to 90$\%$) of all such failures. To address this issue, intelligent algorithms have been developed to evaluate vibrational signals and accurately detect faults, thereby reducing the reliance on expert knowledge and lowering maintenance costs. Within the field of machine learning, Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) have exhibited notable potential, with applications ranging from malware detection in computer systems to fault detection in bearings, which is the primary focus of this study. In pursuit of this objective, we propose a novel procedure for detecting novel instances of anomalies in varying operating conditions, utilizing only the signals derived from the healthy state of the analyzed machine. Our approach incorporates AIS augmented by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the AIS-DTW method yields a considerable improvement in anomaly detection rates (up to 53.83$\%$) compared to the conventional AIS. In summary, our findings indicate that our method represents a significant advancement in enhancing the resilience of AIS-based novelty detection, thereby bolstering the reliability of rotating machines and reducing the need for expertise in bearing fault detection."
Neuro-fuzzy modelling methods for relative density prediction of stainless steel 316L metal parts produced by additive manufacturing technique,2023,['· Additive manufacturing · Artificial neural networks · Machine learning · Neuro-fuzzy modelling · Selective laser melting'],,"Two machine learning (ML) methods, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANN) have been implemented to predict the relative density (RD) of stainless steel 316L parts which are produced in additive manufacturing (AM) machines. The objective of this paper was to create ML models adapted for AM technique to verify the generalized model that predicts RD with the least error. Some important process parameters in AM such as scanning speed, laser power, hatch distance and layer thickness were picked as input and RD was set as output. Effects of the input parameters on RD were discussed and they were represented in the form of surface plots. It has been found that ANN method‘s convergence rate was better than that of ANFIS method, which confirms that usage of neural networks is a better choice than the usage of fuzzy reasoning in modelling AM technique."

However, font recommendation systems predominantly base their similarity criteria on character shape and frame attributes, overlooking weight as a criterion. Existing machine learning approaches that rely on data extracted from some factors tend to exhibit limitations in terms of accuracy. In light of these limitations, this study aims to design weight criteria for characters to allow more precise font discrimination in machine learning. For this purpose, the design of weight criteria in past studies by PANOSE (1991-1997) and Kim (2019) were analyed, each pertaining to the Latin alphabet and Hangeul respectively. The analysis revealed the limitations of the existing Hangeul weight criteria, which, similar to the approach adopted for the Latin alphabet, select discrimination areas by inducing countless stroke weight variables. Factors considered in the design of supplementary criteria for stroke weight measurement were weight change factors of strokes that appear in Hangeul character combinations, morpheme, and baseline. The supplementary stroke weight criteria focused on the vertical stem width of composite characters “마, 맘, 모, 몸, 뫄, 뫔” created from syllabic blocks such as “ᄆ, ᅡ” and “ᅩ”. A specific unit of font discrimination was proposed, where the final weight measurement is calculated by averaging the values obtained from discrimination areas. The results provide a concrete basis for font similarity assessment, taking into account character differentiation factors that can be utilized in the font recommendation system development through weight, and expected to contribute to recommendation of fonts with various impressions."

Five farms were selected to collect smart farm data, and humidity sensors and CO₂ sensors, which were causing problems in smart farm greenhouses, were selected as PHM management targets. Using health management technology, abnormal data detection and failure prediction technology was developed using a mathematical model and a machine learning-based abnormality detection algorithm. As a result of the experiment, the relative humidity estimation algorithm identified more than 90% of the abnormal data and sensor failure conditions and responded to the failure, and the CO₂ concentration could be estimated according to the environment at an absolute average error of 15.4 ppm.

Due to the low accuracy of the measured size during the measurement process, in the military, which uses a relatively more detailed sizing system than civilian casual clothes, the supplied clothes do not fit properly, so the frequency of changing the clothes is very frequent. In addition, there is a problem in that inventory is managed inefficiently by applying the measurement system based on the old generation body shape data collected more than a decade ago without reflecting the western-changed body type change of the MZ generation. That is, military uniforms of the necessary size are insufficient, and many unnecessary-sized military uniforms are in stock. Therefore, in order to reduce the frequency of clothing replacement and improve the efficiency of stock management, deep learning-based automatic measurement of body size, big data analysis, and machine learning-based “Personalized Combat Uniform Automatic Recommendation System for Enlisted Soldiers” is proposed."

Considering the importance of AI, examining teachers’ beliefs about AI in mathematics education (AIME) is crucial, as these beliefs affect their instruction and student learning experiences. The present study developed a scale to measure preservice teachers’ (PST) beliefs about AIME through factor analysis and rigorous reliability and validity analyses. The study analyzed 202 PST’s data and developed a scale comprising three factors and 11 items. The first factor gauges PSTs' beliefs regarding their roles in using AI for mathematics education (4 items), the second factor assesses PSTs' beliefs about using AI for mathematics teaching (3 items), and the third factor explores PSTs' beliefs about AI for mathematics learning (4 items). Moreover, the outcomes of confirmatory factor analysis affirm that the three-factor model outperforms other models (a one-factor or a two-factor model). These findings are in line with previous scales examining mathematics teacher beliefs, reinforcing the notion that such beliefs are multifaceted and developed through diverse experiences. Descriptive analysis reveals that overall PSTs exhibit positive beliefs about AIME. However, they show relatively lower levels of beliefs about their roles in using AI for mathematics education.

Intelligent Shoes for Detecting Blind Falls Using the Internet of Things,2023,"['Fall detection', 'Flex sensor', 'Internet of Things', 'light sensor', 'the 50Kg load scale sensor', 'smart shoe', 'visually impaired', 'Machine Learning']",,"In our daily lives, we engage in a variety of tasks that rely on our senses, such as seeing. Blindness is the absence of the sense of vision. According to the World Health Organization, 2.2 billion people worldwide suffer from various forms of vision impairment. Unfortunately, blind people face a variety of indoor and outdoor challenges on a daily basis, limiting their mobility and preventing them from engaging in other activities. Blind people are very vulnerable to a variety of hazards, including falls. Various barriers, such as stairs, can cause a fall. The Internet of Things (IoT) is used to track falls and send a warning message to the blind caretakers. One of the gaps in the previous works is that they were unable to differentiate between falls true and false. Treating false falls as true falls results in many false alarms being sent to the blind caretakers and thus, they may reject the IoT system. As a means of bridging this chasm, this paper proposes an intelligent shoe that is able to precisely distinguish between false and true falls based on three sensors, namely, the load scale sensor, the light sensor, and the Flex sensor. The proposed IoT system is tested in an indoor environment for various scenarios of falls using four models of machine learning. The results from our system showed an accuracy of 0.96%. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our system is simpler and more accurate since it avoids sending false alarms to the blind caretakers."
Time‑frequency analysis of speech signal using Chirplet transform for automatic diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease,2023,"['Chirplet transform', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Parkinson’s disease (PD)', 'Time-frequency representation', 'Speech Pathology', 'Support vector machine']",,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the world after Alzheimer’s disease.Early diagnosing PD is challenging as it evolved slowly, and its symptoms eventuate gradually. Recent studies have demonstratedthat changes in speech may be utilized as an excellent biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD. In this study, we haveproposed a Chirplet transform (CT) based novel approach for diagnosing PD using speech signals. We employed CT to get thetime-frequency matrix (TFM) of each speech recording, and we extracted time-frequency based entropy (TFE) features fromthe TFM. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the TFE features reflect the changes in speech that occurs in the speechdue to PD, hence can be used for classifying the PD and healthy control (HC) individuals. The effectiveness of the proposedframework is validated using the vowels and words from the PC-GITA database. The genetic algorithm is utilized to selectthe optimum features subset, while a support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), andNaïve Bayes (NB) classifiers are employed for classification. The TFE features outperform the breathiness and Mel frequencycepstral coefficients (MFCC) features. The SVM classifier is most effective compared to other machine-learning classifiers.The highest classification accuracy rates of 98% and 99% are achieved using the vowel /a/ and word /atleta/, respectively.The results reveal that the proposed CT-based entropy features effectively diagnose PD using the speech of a person."
Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network assisted Peak to Average Power Ratio Reduction for Underwater Acoustic Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Communication,2023,"['underwater acoustic communication', 'orthogonal frequency divisional multiplexing', 'long short-time memory neural network', 'machine learning', 'PAPR']",,"The underwater acoustic wireless communication networks are generally formed by the different autonomous underwater acoustic vehicles, and transceivers interconnected to the bottom of the ocean with battery deployed modems. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has become the most popular modulation technique in underwater acoustic communication due to its high data transmission and robustness over other symmetrical modulation techniques. To maintain the operability of underwater acoustic communication networks, the power consumption of battery-operated transceivers becomes a vital necessity to be minimized. The OFDM technology has a major lack of peak to average power ratio (PAPR) which results in the consumption of more power, creating non-linear distortion and increasing the bit error rate (BER). To overcome this situation, we have contributed our symmetry research into three dimensions. Firstly, we propose a machine learning-based underwater acoustic communication system through long short-term memory neural network (LSTM-NN). Secondly, the proposed LSTM-NN reduces the PAPR and makes the system reliable and efficient, which turns into a better performance of BER. Finally, the simulation and water tank experimental data results are executed which proves that the LSTM-NN is the best solution for mitigating the PAPR with non-linear distortion and complexity in the overall communication system."

Unlike classical machine learning (ML) algorithms, which require human effort to craft well-structured features, an ANN automatically extracts complex patterns as features and passes them into ML to perform various downstream tasks, such as classification and segmentation. Hence, ANNs have made most classical ML algorithms obsolete for many tasks. In addition, deep learning-based models, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and generative adversarial neural networks, accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Therefore, it is essential for novices in ML to understand the basic functionality of ANN to pursue deep learning-related algorithms.

Papert’s constructionist theory is based on the notion that learning is grounded in tangible outcomes. Similar to the existing constructionist theories, Papert’s theory emphasizes the active role of learners in constructing knowledge through experiences, thereby highlighting a “child-centered perspective.” Furthermore, his constructionist theory values children as active participants in creating and sharing important values for themselves and society rather than mere passive recipients of information. In this regard, Papert’s theory has significant implications for early childhood education as it encourages child-centered education focused on play, which enhances children’s abilities to create and share values for themselves and society. At present, there is a growing interest in education utilizing cutting-edge media, such as maker education and digital media education. Revisiting Papert’s theory, which is considered a pioneer in machine-assisted learning in the post-digital era, provides new ways of thinking and research tools for children and teachers. Moreover, it offers a psychological foundation for learning in early childhood education that incorporates maker education through advanced media."

화학 공정 설계 및 분석을 위한 설명 가능한 인공지능 대안 모델,2023,"['XAI', 'Process analysis', 'Surrogate modeling', 'Process systems engineering']",,"Since the growing interest in surrogate modeling, there has been continuous research aimed at simulating nonlinear chemical processes using data-driven machine learning. However, the opaque nature of machine learning models, which limits their interpretability, poses a challenge for their practical application in industry. Therefore, this study aims to analyze chemical processes using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a concept that improves interpretability while ensuring model accuracy. While conventional sensitivity analysis of chemical processes has been limited to calculating and ranking the sensitivity indices of variables, we propose a methodology that utilizes XAI to not only perform global and local sensitivity analysis, but also examine the interactions among variables to gain physical insights from the data.For the ammonia synthesis process, which is the target process of the case study, we set the temperature of the preheater leading to the first reactor and the split ratio of the cold shot to the three reactors as process variables. By integrating Matlab and Aspen Plus, we obtained data on ammonia production and the maximum temperatures of the three reactors while systematically varying the process variables. We then trained tree-based models and performed sensitivity analysis using the SHAP technique, one of the XAI methods, on the most accurate model. The global sensitivity analysis showed that the preheater temperature had the greatest effect, and the local sensitivity analysis provided insights for defining the ranges of process variables to improve productivity and prevent overheating. By constructing alternative models for chemical processes and using XAI for sensitivity analysis, this work contributes to providing both quantitative and qualitative feedback for process optimization."

The PINN directly applies PDEs to the construction of the loss function, introducing physical constraints to machine learning training. This technique can also be applied to wave equation modeling. However, to solve the wave equation using the PINN, second-order differentiations with respect to input data must be performed during neural network training, and the resulting wavefields contain complex dynamical phenomena, requiring careful strategies. This tutorial elucidates the fundamental concepts of the PINN and discusses considerations for wave equation modeling using the PINN approach. These considerations include spatial coordinate normalization, the selection of activation functions, and strategies for incorporating physics loss. Our experimental results demonstrated that normalizing the spatial coordinates of the training data leads to a more accurate reflection of initial conditions in neural network training for wave equation modeling. Furthermore, the characteristics of various functions were compared to select an appropriate activation function for wavefield prediction using neural networks. These comparisons focused on their differentiation with respect to input data and their convergence properties. Finally, the results of two scenarios for incorporating physics loss into the loss function during neural network training were compared. Through numerical experiments, a curriculum-based learning strategy, applying physics loss after the initial training steps, was more effective than utilizing physics loss from the early training steps. In addition, the effectiveness of the PINN technique was confirmed by comparing these results with those of training without any use of physics loss."

Integrating big data statistical projects with digital technologies in high school <Artificial Intelligence> mathematics courses has the potential to provide students with a learning experience of high impact that can develop these essential skills. This paper proposes a set of guidelines for designing effective big data statistical project-based tasks and evaluates the tasks in the artificial intelligence mathematics textbook against these criteria. The proposed guidelines recommend that projects should: (1) align knowledge and skills with the national school mathematics curriculum; (2) use preprocessed massive datasets; (3) employ data scientists' problem-solving methods; (4) encourage decision-making; (5) leverage technological tools; and (6) promote collaborative learning. The findings indicate that few textbooks fully align with these guidelines, with most failing to incorporate elements corresponding to Guideline 2 in their project tasks. In addition, most tasks in the textbooks overlook or omit data preprocessing, either by using smaller datasets or by using big data without any form of preprocessing. This can potentially result in misconceptions among students regarding the nature of big data. Furthermore, this paper discusses the relevant mathematical knowledge and skills necessary for artificial intelligence, as well as the potential benefits and pedagogical considerations associated with integrating technology into big data tasks.

In order to introduce generative AI into education, learning methods must be changed in the way that students make questions on themselves, and teachers must act as curators of learning materials generated by AI. Students’ thinking skills and learning process must be recorded and measured for assessments. In addition, education has to help students improve new machine-based or AI literacy needed in the era of generative AI, critical thinking, and creative thinking. Generally, educational communities show positive attitudes toward generative AI, however, it should be introduced carefully so as not to hinder development of students’ cognitive abilities and self-directedness. Three ways to integrate generative AI into education are to use it as a tutor for students’ learning process, to use it as a tool for teachers designing classes and providing feedback, and teaching it as an educational content in an information curriculum. Finally, for generative AI to be successfully integrated in schools, along with fine-tuning of generative AI to be optimized for education, it is prerequisite to make OER platforms used actively and support IT infrastructure in educational institutes financially."

While the recent advent of low-cost air sensors has enabled real-time measurement of particulate matter, discrepancies in concentrations can arise depending on the sensor used, the measuring environment, and the manufacturer. In light of this, we aimed to propose a method to calibrate measurements between low-cost air sensor devices. In our study, we introduced decision tree techniques, commonly used in machine learning for classification and regression problems, to categorize particulate matter concentration intervals. For each interval, both univariate and multivariate multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to derive calibration equations. The concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 measured indoors and outdoors with two types of LCS equipment and the GRIMM 11-A device were compared and analyzed, confirming the necessity for distinguishing between indoor and outdoor spaces and categorizing concentration intervals. Furthermore, the decision tree calibration method showed greater accuracy than traditional methods. On the other hand, during univariate regression analysis, the proportion exceeding a PM2.5/PM10 ratio of 1 was significantly high. However, using multivariate regression analysis, the exceedance rate decreased to 79.1% for IAQ-C7 and 89.3% for PMM-130, demonstrating that calibration through multivariate regression analysis considering both PM10 and PM2.5 is more effective. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the accurate calibration of particulate matter measurements and have showcased the potential for scientifically and rationally calibrating data using machine learning."

Using that information, they get into the original website and try to modify or steal the information. The problem with traditional defense systems like firewalls is that they can only stop certain types of attacks because they rely on a fixed set of principles to do so. As a result, the model needs a client-side defense mechanism that can learn potential attack vectors to detect and prevent not only the known but also unknown types of assault. Feature selection plays a key role in machine learning by selecting only the required features by eliminating the irrelevant ones from the real-time dataset.

Forensic-based investigation-optimized extreme gradient boosting system for predicting compressive strength of ready-mixed concrete,2023,"['metaheuristic optimization', 'forensic-based investigation', 'XGBoost', 'ready-mixed concrete', 'compressive strength', 'prediction']",,"Regulations mandate testing concrete’s compressive strength after the concrete has cured for 28 days. In the ideal situation, cured strength equals the target strength. Advanced estimation of concrete’s compressive strength can facilitate quality management, improve safety, and present economic advantages in sustainable use. Basic statistical methods cannot effectively predict concrete’s strength or its non-linear relationships with the proportions of its constituent materials. In this study, a baseline model for predicting concrete’s compressive strength was constructed using a state-of-the-art machine-learning method. Most related studies have used sets of concrete mix design results concerning concrete specimens for laboratory-produced concrete specimens as training sets and have obtained simple models through regression; however, these models have been unsuitable for onsite prediction of the compressive strength of concrete with the various mix designs. Control over mix proportions is high in laboratories, resulting in low variation; onsite manual operation and environmental factors cause significant variations in assessment data. In this study, machine-learning techniques and a newly developed metaheuristic optimization algorithm were applied to big long-term data from 75 concrete plants to construct the optimal machine-learning model. Our self-developed forensic-based investigation algorithm was employed to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the extreme gradient boosting model and to improve the model’s generalizability. The lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) obtained using this model was 9.29%, which was smaller than the lowest MAPE achieved using the conventional simple regression with the water-to-binder (W/B) ratio (12.73%). The traditional method tends to overestimate the actual compressive strength. Finally, a convenient expert system was developed that facilitates the use of the proposed model by onsite engineers for quality management. This system expedites the judgment of whether a mixed design is reasonable, reducing production costs while maintaining the safety of concrete structures. It can be widely applied in practice and function as an effective decision-making tool."

Judgment algorithms are used for recruitment or crime prediction, and there is a high possibility of bias due to the limitations of learning data. In addition, there is a great concern that recommended algorithms can confirm prejudice. This is because a filter bubble phenomenon in which other information is excluded while recommending specific information may occur. The occurrence of such prejudice is also a limitation of data-based machine learning. This is because public information processed as learning data contains all prejudices or errors in the world. AI models based on data in which human problems are projected also learn human problems as they are. Therefore, social problems caused by algorithms will continue to be raised. For example, algorithms for judging recruitment or creditworthiness and data learning them contain biases, or infringement of basic rights undermines the value of life. Algorithm disclosure is one of the ways to solve various problems caused by algorithms. In response, platform operators say that algorithms cannot be disclosed because they are trade secrets. The position is no different in the public sector. The problem is that algorithmic regulators cannot provide reasonable criteria for algorithm disclosure. In order to gain convincing power for algorithm disclosure, a plan to secure legitimacy must be presented. In other words, regulatory agencies must provide platform operators with specific reasons or methods for algorithm disclosure. This is because regulators must achieve clear policy goals, and platform operators must have predictability. Therefore, we would like to present a specific plan for algorithm disclosure and a reasonable plan for a reliable algorithm through comparative bridges with trade secrets that operators are concerned about."
Estimating vegetation index for outdoor free-range pig production using YOLO,2023,"['Outdoor', 'Pig', 'Production', 'Vegetation index', 'Image analysis']",,"The objective of this study was to quantitatively estimate the level of grazing area damage in outdoor free-range pig production using a Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with an RGB image sensor. Ten corn field images were captured by a UAV over approximately two weeks, during which gestating sows were allowed to graze freely on the corn field measuring 100 × 50 m2. The images were corrected to a bird’s-eye view, and then divided into 32 segments and sequentially inputted into the YOLOv4 detector to detect the corn images according to their condition. The 43 raw training images selected randomly out of 320 segmented images were flipped to create 86 images, and then these images were further augmented by rotating them in 5-degree increments to create a total of 6,192 images. The increased 6,192 images are further augmented by applying three random color transformations to each image, resulting in 24,768 datasets. The occupancy rate of corn in the field was estimated efficiently using You Only Look Once (YOLO). As of the first day of observation (day 2), it was evident that almost all the corn had disappeared by the ninth day. When grazing 20 sows in a 50 × 100 m2 cornfield (250 m2/sow), it appears that the animals should be rotated to other grazing areas to protect the cover crop after at least five days. In agricultural technology, most of the research using machine and deep learning is related to the detection of fruits and pests, and research on other application fields is needed. In addition, large-scale image data collected by experts in the field are required as training data to apply deep learning. If the data required for deep learning is insufficient, a large number of data augmentation is required."
핵심성과지표를 이용한 주식투자전략에 관한 연구,2023,"['가치관련성', '영업손익', '이익지속성', '핵심손익', 'core earnings', 'earnings persistence', 'operating income', 'return predictability']",,"Separating transitory components from recurring components of earnings is a primary task in financial statement analysis. A recent study by Rouen et al. (2021) uses a proprietary database compiled by New Constructs and evaluate whether their earnings measure after excluding transitory components from GAAP earnings has incremental explanatory power for future earnings. They show that their “core” earnings measure (as referred to in Rouen et al. (2021)) is more persistent than Compustat-defined operating income, suggesting that a core earnings measure effectively excludes transitory (i.e., less persistent) components of GAAP earnings. They also find that investors and financial analysts do not immediately incorporate the differential implications of the recurring and non-recurring components of earnings into stock prices, and that a trading strategy based on their non-core earnings components yields annual abnormal return of 8%.Given the findings of Rouen et al. (2021), it is an empirical question whether a core earnings measure distinguishes between recurring and transitory components of earnings more effectively than do other earnings measures in countries outside the U.S. In this study, we follow the procedure outlined in Rouen et al. (2021) and attempt to exclude the non-recurring components from net income of Korean listed firms. Specifically, we identify the non-recurring components of earnings from the DataGuide database and estimate a core earnings measure by excluding from net income (1) currency fluctuations, (2) discontinued operations, and (3) gains and losses labeled as “other” on the income statement. We then compare the persistence and return predictability of core earnings and various commonly used adjusted income measures such as operating income, gross margin, income before income taxes, and income from continuing operations of Korean firms listed in KOSPI and KOSDAQ from 2012 to 2020.The results suggest that operating income is most persistent, followed by core earnings, income from continuing operations, gross margin, and income before income taxes when predicting one-year ahead net income. We further report that both non-operating income (i.e., net income minus operating income) and non-core earnings (i.e., net income minus core earnings) have some information contents in that they are predictive of one-year ahead net income with smaller magnitudes compared to their counterparts. Portfolio analyses based on operating income and core earnings show that both measures are predictive of future stock returns, implying that investors in the Korean stock market act as if they fail to fully incorporate the information contained in the transitory and permanent components of current earnings into stock prices, similar to the findings of Rouen et al. (2021). Our results confirm that 1) operating income and core earnings are comparably superior to other adjusted earnings measures as key performance indicators of a firm and 2) a trading strategy based on these measures yields profitable returns in the Korean stock market.Our results should be interpreted with caution. While Rouen et al. (2021) indicate that New Constructs uses both fundamental analysis and machine learning to extract transitory components of earnings, the core earnings measure used in this study only utilizes the income statement items readily available from the DataGuide database for Korean listed firms. A procedure that closely replicates Rouen et al. (2021) (including machine learning) may yield a core earnings proxy with improved persistence and future earnings predictability by distinguishing between transitory and permanent components of earnings more effectively. Despite the differences in the measurement, our results suggest that operating income is comparable to core earnings in terms of earnings and return predictability without considering a machine-learning algorithm for estimating core earnings.

Several AI ethics models have emerged, but they mainly focus on reducing the impact of new technologies rather than dealing with social acceptance issues. We can approach AI ethics issues more realistically by reconsidering contemporary society’s relationship between humans and machines. Thus, it is necessary to start with a sufficient understanding of labor and synthesize different techno-sociological viewpoints on AI. Lastly, the article proposes four basic principles of AI ethics consistent with re-establishing the relationship between humans and machines and presents examples in response to this principle.

Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction Using Attention Mechanism with Dual-Phase 18 F-Florbetaben Images,2023,['Alzheimer’s disease · Amyloid-β · Blood perfusion · Functional neuroimaging · Machine learning · Neural network'],,"Introduction Amyloid-beta (Aβ) imaging test plays an important role in the early diagnosis and research of biomarkers ofAlzheimer’s disease (AD) but a single test may produce Aβ-negative AD or Aβ-positive cognitively normal (CN). In thisstudy, we aimed to distinguish AD from CN with dual-phase 18F-Florbetaben (FBB) via a deep learning–based attentionmethod and evaluate the AD positivity scores compared to late-phase FBB which is currently adopted for AD diagnosis.Materials and Methods A total of 264 patients (74 CN and 190 AD), who underwent FBB imaging test and neuropsychologicaltests, were retrospectively analyzed. Early- and delay-phase FBB images were spatially normalized with an in-houseFBB template. The regional standard uptake value ratios were calculated with the cerebellar region as a reference regionand used as independent variables that predict the diagnostic label assigned to the raw image.Results AD positivity scores estimated from dual-phase FBB showed better accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiveroperating characteristic curve (AUROC) for AD detection (ACC: 0.858, AUROC: 0.831) than those from delay phase FBBimaging (ACC: 0.821, AUROC: 0.794). AD positivity score estimated by dual-phase FBB (R: −0.5412) shows a highercorrelation with psychological test compared to only dFBB (R: −0.2975). In the relevance analysis, we observed that LSTMuses different time and regions of early-phase FBB for each disease group for AD detection.Conclusions These results show that the aggregated model with dual-phase FBB with long short-term memory and attentionmechanism can be used to provide a more accurate AD positivity score, which shows a closer association with AD, than theprediction with only a single phase FBB."

Gene selection based on tree models has been the subject ofseveral studies. However, these methods are based on a single-tree model, often not robust to ultra-highdimensionalmicroarray datasets, resulting in the loss of useful information and unsatisfactory classificationaccuracy. Motivated by the limitations of single-tree-based gene selection, in this study, ensemble gene selectionmethods based on multiple-tree models were studied to improve the classification performance of tumoridentification. Specifically, we selected the three most representative tree models: ID3, random forest, andgradient boosting decision tree.

If the future reuse distance, which means when the same data is re-referenced, is greater than the write buffer size, a strategy of directly flushing it in the flash memory without storing it in the buffer is used. However, since it is impossible to accurately predict the future reuse distance and is not essential for buffer management, we first group the future reuse distance into several levels considering the size of the write buffer. Then, a priority-based buffer management policy is proposed by taking the grouped future reuse distance as a priority for caching.

A Stay Detection Algorithm Using GPS Trajectory and Points of Interest Data,2023,"['POI', 'k-means clustering', 'SVM', 'location estimation', 'GPS']",,"Points of interest (POIs) are widely used in tourism recommendations and to provide information about areas of interest. Currently, situation judgement using POI and GPS data is mainly rule-based. However, this approach has the limitation that inferences can only be made using predefined POI information. In this study, we propose an algorithm that uses POI data, GPS data, and schedule information to calculate the current speed, location, schedule matching, movement trajectory, and POI coverage, and uses machine learning to determine whether to stay or go. Based on the input data, the clustered information is labelled by k-means algorithm as unsupervised learning. This result is trained as the input vector of the SVM model to calculate the probability of moving and staying. Therefore, in this study, we implemented an algorithm that can adjust the schedule using the travel schedule, POI data, and GPS information. The results show that the algorithm does not rely on predefined information, but can make judgements using GPS data and POI data in real time, which is more flexible and reliable than traditional rule-based approaches. Therefore, this study can optimize tourism scheduling. Therefore, the stay detection algorithm using GPS movement trajectories and POIs developed in this study provides important information for tourism schedule planning and is expected to provide much value for tourism services."
양수발전 설비에 적용 가능한 새로운 고장 예측경보 알고리즘 개발,2023,"['Pumped Storage Power Plant', 'Prediction Alarm Algorithm']",,"The large process plant is currently implementing predictive maintenance technology to transition from the traditional Time-Based Maintenance (TBM) approach to the Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) approach in order to improve equipment maintenance and productivity. The traditional techniques for predictive maintenance involved managing upper/lower thresholds (Set-Point) of equipment signals or identifying anomalies through control charts. Recently, with the development of techniques for big analysis, machine learning-based AAKR (Auto-Associative Kernel Regression) and deep learning-based VAE (Variation Auto-Encoder) techniques are being actively applied for predictive maintenance. However, this predictive maintenance techniques is only effective during steady-state operation of plant equipment, and it is difficult to apply them during start-up and shutdown periods when rises or falls. In addition, unlike processes such as nuclear and thermal power plants, which operate for hundreds of days after a single start-up, because the pumped power plant involves repeated start-ups and shutdowns 4-5 times a day, it is needed the prediction and alarm algorithm suitable for its characteristics. In this study, we aim to propose an approach to apply the optimal predictive alarm algorithm that is suitable for the characteristics of Pumped Storage Power Plant(PSPP) facilities to the system by analyzing the predictive maintenance techniques used in existing nuclear and coal power plants."

The author of a book is a human, and the book exists as a mass-copied product of the author's manuscript. The printing press is a machine that mass copies the human-written manuscript into a book. In contrast, ChatGPT generates sentences by 'stealing' various knowledge produced by humans. Picasso, frequently quoted by Steve Jobs, once said, ""Good artists copy, great artists steal."" If printing is considered a good artist, will generative AI evolve to the level of a great artist? Generative AI holds the destructive power to reset the 'default value' of cultural evolution, constituted by human collective memory and collective learning. The future of civilization is projected to enter a post-human era, where the leading role is no longer held by humans, but by how ""collaboration between humans and machines"" is achieved. Then, what does it mean to be human in the post-human era? ""A spectre is haunting the world — the spectre of ChatGPT!""

Optimal design of main girder structure of bridge crane based on equal life concept driven by data,2023,['· Crane · Equal life · Fatigue life · Structural optimization · Optimization algorithm · Finite element'],,"In traditional structural crane design, the fatigue strength of the structure is qualitatively evaluated, only depending on the steel type, working level and joint form, which leads to the excessive service life of some parts of the existing main girder structure, resulting in a waste of industrial resources and manufacturing costs. Based on the concept of equal life design, this paper obtained the service information of the crane in the scheduled inspection period through the rapid prediction method of ""field collection+machine learning."" Combined with the bearing capacity evaluation method and the fatigue life assessment method of ""S-N curve+ fracture mechanics,"" a nonlinear mixed integer equal life optimization model of crane girder structure was established, and the multi-specular reflection optimization algorithm was used to optimize the life distribution at different positions and overall weight of the main girder. The structural design parameters of the crane main girder which meet the bearing capacity and have the characteristics of ""equal life+lightweight"" were obtained. The performance of the optimized main girder structure was verified by finite element simulation. The results show that this method can realize the quantitative control of the life distribution of each position of the crane main girder structure and the lightweight design of the whole structure, and provides a scientific reference for the equal life and lightweight design of large construction machinery products."

RNN-Based Main Transformer OLTC Control for SMR Integration into a High Renewable Energy Penetrated Grid,2023,"['Voltage stability', 'Small modular reactor', 'Renewable energy', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'On-load tap-changer']",,"Voltage control is desirable for voltage stability of an electrical power system. Isolated high renewable energy grids have become a common phenomenon in the wake of the global shift to clean renewable energy sources (RES) fronted to achieve carbon neutrality. The most dominant RES are solar photovoltaic and wind energy which rely on switched power-electronic devices to cope with grid reactive power requirements. These devices often fall out of step with other synchronous generators due to the mismatch in synchronizing speed whenever a system disturbance occurs. Previous studies propose that voltage and frequency instability can be mitigated by the integration of a small modular reactor (SMR) in the RES grid. SMRs have load-following capability, reactive power compensation and supplementary voltage regulation capability; which is achieved using the main transformer’s on-load tap changer (OLTC). This paper proposes application of advanced machine learning-based recurrent neural networks (RNN) for the SMR main transformer OLTC control by leveraging on multiple parameters to predict the appropriate percentage tap values. The RNN model is built and tested using simulation data obtained from load flow analysis using the electrical transient and analysis program."

However, it lacks standardized interpretation criteria, and there is a high level of subjective intervention by evaluators during the evaluation process, resulting in low reliability. In order to resolve these problems, the researchers proposed an AI system HTP Object Detection Model that classified house, tree, person objects in HTP test results based on AI object detection models and sent meaningful interpretations by receiving location and size values used for formal analysis. For the study, image data of 98 houses, 98 trees, and 196 people were collected between September and October 2022. The model was trained using machine learning. A high-accuracy model was developed with an Accuracy of 90% and F1-Score of 95%. The model calculated the location and size information of the objects and provided formal interpretations that matched the corresponding values. The validity of the model was measured by art therapy experts evaluating the formal interpretation derived from HTP test images inputted into the model. The average validity was 79%. By adding diverse training data and more detailed interpretations in the future, it was expected that an formal analysis model of HTP test would be developed to supplement the projective drawing test reliability of art therapists. Based on these research findings, the significance and limitations of this study were discussed."

However, for the general public, reading and understanding legal information remains a challenging task. Moreover, it is still difficult to find refined legal data at a level that can be effectively learned by machine-based entities like AI lawyers.Creating a substantial amount of high-quality legal data in a short period is not something easily achievable by a single entity. Therefore, it is necessary to foster an inclusive data ecosystem that allows participation from anyone, enabling the construction of legal datasets. It is crucial to ensure the accuracy of legal data content, as its integrity is of utmost importance.Apart from this, if one puts in the mental effort to create legal data, it is only reasonable to expect appropriate compensation. If legal data becomes an object of trade, available for purchase by anyone, it is anticipated to yield stable profits based on its concrete and practical value, surpassing any existing virtual assets.This paper proposes a method to massively build high-quality legal data using blockchain-based smart contract technology. By ensuring anonymity and stability, it allows anyone to participate freely while ensuring the content's accuracy through the approval of other participants before registering as new legal data. To generate revenue, tokens will be issued for each created legal data, and whenever royalty profits arise from the legal data, individuals will receive a portion of the profits based on the ratio of the tokens they possess compared to the total tokens issued. This approach enables not only participants in the construction of legal data but also third parties, such as simple investors, to freely dispose of tokens, giving legal data the potential to transcend virtual assets and achieve the status of virtual goods."
A Ship-Wake Joint Detection Using Sentinel-2 Imagery,2023,"['Ship detection', 'Random forest', 'Mask R-CNN', 'Wake detection']",,"Ship detection is widely used in areas such as maritime security, maritime traffic, fisheriesmanagement, illegal fishing, and border control, and ship detection is important for rapid response and damageminimization as ship accident rates increase due to recent increases in international maritime traffic. Currently,according to a number of global and national regulations, ships must be equipped with automatic identificationsystem (AIS), which provide information such as the location and speed of the ship periodically at regularintervals. However, most small vessels (less than 300 tons) are not obligated to install the transponder and maynot be transmitted intentionally or accidentally. There is even a case of misuse of the ship’s location information.Therefore, in this study, ship detection was performed using high-resolution optical satellite images that canperiodically remotely detect a wide range and detect small ships. However, optical images can cause false-alarmdue to noise on the surface of the sea, such as waves, or factors indicating ship-like brightness, such as cloudsand wakes. So, it is important to remove these factors to improve the accuracy of ship detection. In this study,false alarm was reduced, and the accuracy of ship detection was improved by removing wake. As a ship detectionmethod, ship detection was performed using machine learning-based random forest (RF), and convolutionalneural network (CNN) techniques that have been widely used in object detection fields recently, and ship detectionresults by the model were compared and analyzed. In addition, in this study, the results of RF and CNN werecombined to improve the phenomenon of ship disconnection and the phenomenon of small detection. The shipdetection results of this study are significant in that they improved the limitations of each model while maintainingaccuracy. In addition, if satellite images with improved spatial resolution are utilized in the future, it is expectedthat ship and wake simultaneous detection with higher accuracy will be performed."

In this respect, Moniz and Jong(2014) had studied the effect of the monetary policy communication of the Bank of England on the future market interest rate expectation of the market participants using the economic sentiment analysis. In detail, they had extracted the monetary policy themes, relating to economic growth, inflation, and market interests, from the minutes of the monthly monetary policy meeting of the Bank of England, and they had also extracted the economic sentiment words, such as positive or negative words among those monetary policy themes. Then they had created the economic sentiment index using these words. And with these data, they predicted the market interest rate, such as forward interest rates, using the various prediction models. Finally, they showed that the market interest rate prediction using these data reflected the significant change in the future interest rates.This paper also tried to reveal the usefulness of the sentiment analysis for forecasting of the market interest rates, supposed that the market participants would predict the future market interest rates using those information. Therefore, based on the Moniz and Jong(2014)’s technique, we studied if Korean market interest rates in the future would properly reflect those economic sentiments. For this purpose, this study, firstly extracted five monetary policy themes from the press releases of the Bank of Korea relating to the monetary policy decision in the every month during the period of 15 years, using the text mining method of Park and Kim(2022). And secondly, we extracted economic sentiment words from each monetary policy themes and created each economic sentiment index. Lastly we forecasted the future interest rates of a Convertible Deposit(maturity of three months) and Treasury Bond rate(maturity of three years) in one month later just after the date of the monetary policy decision of the Bank of Korea. As a forecasting method, we used machine learning method, such as support vector machine and random forest, and a deep learning method using simple neural nets in addition to a general linear regression method. And we included the average of the above all predicted interest rates as a predicted data. For the test of forecasting power, we segregated the whole data into two parts. One part is 75% of the whole data for the training of machine learning and deep learning models, and the other is 25% of the whole data for the test of the forecasting power. As a result of this analysis, we found that the interest rate forecasting power were much higher when the economic sentiment information was included. Among the forecasting methods, the machine learning methods had much higher forecasting power. Especially the random forest method had the better forecasting power among all forecasting methods. Lastly, the average of all forecasting results of every forecasting methods had the best forecasting power.As a result of this study, it is implied that the usage of economic sentiment analysis would be a better way of forecasting the future interest rates and the machine learning methods would be also helpful to forecast future interest rates. In addition, it is also implied that the sentiment analysis may be helpful for the study of forecasting the other market variables such as exchange rates and stock prices."

Fair use criteria are not fixed but continue to evolve with the technology changes in circumstances. In the machine learning balance problem fair use cannot balance between the exclusive rights of copyright owners and the developer of machine learning technology.Applying fair use doctrine to machine learning can break the balance-of-interest mechanism inherent in copyright law.

Additionally, it analyzes the extent to which evaluations of the Moon government influenced voters' choices in a situation where there was a high level of aversion towards both candidates. Furthermore, it focuses on independent voters and examines the factors that influenced their voting choices and their characteristics. In this study, both conventional regression analysis and machine learning techniques were analyzed simultaneously to determine whether there were differences between the two analyses and whether machine learning techniques provided a new dimension of discussion for Korean elections.The analysis results showed, as expected, that voters' emotions and attitudes towards the candidates and parties were the most crucial factors in their voting choices. Moreover, evaluations of the Moon government and economic performance were found to have a significant impact on voters' choices in the 2022 presidential election. On the other hand, the choice of independent voters was mainly centered around the candidates and the economic situation. The results of logistic analysis using machine learning technique showed slight differences from those of the conventional logistic analysis. This is because machine learning techniques are trained to produce better predictive results not only based on current data but also when new data is input. In the future, the active adoption of machine learning techniques seems necessary to increase predictability and generality in research results and to develop discussions that can provide a precise direction based on these findings."

The stress triaxiality for each ply were analyzed for buckling analysis, and the representative loading type was designated through the determined loading type within decision area divided into two regions of the same size in the thickness direction of the elements. The input value of the training data and label consisted in coordination of element and representative loading type of each decision area, respectively. A machine learning model was trained through the training data, and the hyperparameters that affect the performance of the machine learning model were tuned to optimal values through Bayesian algorithm.

However, existing diagnostic approaches are resource-intensive, demanding both high cost and expertise, which complicates early intervention. In this study, we propose an optimal model and hyperparameter settings suitable for early dementia diagnosis using machine learning and deep learning models trained and tested on 19-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) data (50 normal subjects, 175 mild cognitive impairment subjects) collected via a dry methodology. While previous studies utilized 64-channel high-resolution EEG data acquired through a wet methodology, this study is distinct in its use of 19-channel dry EEG data, which reduces the burden on researchers and patients. The experiment was conducted by training a binary classifier using an ensemble-based AutoML algorithm, Auto-sklearn, and three deep learning models (ShallowFBCSPNet, Deep4Net, EEGNet), followed by a comparison of their respective performances. EEGNet demonstrated the best results (accuracy = 68.9%). Next, to address the overfitting problem due to data imbalance, four data imbalance processing algorithms (class weight, Gaussian noise, frequency shift, and undersampling) were applied to EEGNet. The best performance (accuracy = 78.9%) was achieved with Gaussian noise applied to EEGNet. This study’s findings suggest the potential utility of combining 19-channel dry EEG data with the proposed method for early dementia diagnosis."

First, the correlation between variables was confirmed by quantitatively connecting dissolution as an input condition with the tested data. After determining the importance of variables through regression analysis, variables with strong effects on drug dissolution were derived according to their importance. Next, it was compared with the results of a machine learning algorithm that has undergone an optimization process through 500 iterations.

This study was conducted to non-destructively evaluate the chlorophyll content of pear tree leaves using unmanned aerial vehicle-based hyperspectral imagery for two years (2021, 2022). The reflectance of the single bands of the pear tree canopy extracted through image processing was band rationed to minimize unstable radiation effects depending on time changes. The estimation (calibration and validation) models were developed using machine learning algorithms of elastic-net, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machine with band ratios as input variables. By comparing the performance of estimation models based on full band ratios, key band ratios that are advantageous for reducing computational costs and improving reproducibility were selected. As a result, for all machine learning models, when calibration of coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>)≥0.67, root mean squared error (RMSE)≤1.22 μg/㎠, relative error (RE)≤17.9% and validation of R<sup>2</sup>≥0.56, RMSE≤1.41 μg/㎠, RE≤20.7% using full band ratios were compared, four key band ratios were selected. There was relatively no significant difference in validation performance between machine learning models. Therefore, the KNN model with the highest calibration performance was used as the standard, and its key band ratios were 710/714, 718/722, 754/758, and 758/762 nm. The performance of calibration showed R<sup>2</sup>=0.80, RMSE=0.94 μg/㎠, RE=13.9%, and validation showed R<sup>2</sup>=0.57, RMSE=1.40 μg/㎠, RE=20.5%. Although the performance results based on validation were not sufficient to estimate the chlorophyll content of pear tree leaves, it is meaningful that key band ratios were selected as a standard for future research. To improve estimation performance, it is necessary to continuously secure additional datasets and improve the estimation model by reproducing it in actual orchards. In future research, it is necessary to continuously secure additional datasets to improve estimation performance, verify the reliability of the selected key band ratios, and upgrade the estimation model to be reproducible in actual orchards."

In this study, a multi-classification prediction study for uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) was conducted by applying random forest model based on a decision tree among machine learning techniques widely used in various fields to machine data and ground data acquired at three slurry shield TBM sites. For the classification prediction, the training and test data were divided into 7:3, and a grid search including 5-fold cross-validation was used to select the optimal parameter. As a result of classification learning for UCS using a random forest, the accuracy of the multi-classification prediction model was found to be high at both 0.983 and 0.982 in the training set and the test set, respectively. However, due to the imbalance in data distribution between classes, the recall was evaluated low in class 4. It is judged that additional research is needed to increase the amount of measured data of UCS acquired in various sites."

Discrimination refers to situations where specific protected groups based on attributes such as gender or race receive biased predictions from machine learning models. Previous research has primarily focused on mitigating data imbalances for binary protected groups, making it challenging to extend fairness improvements to multiple protected groups. Hence, this paper proposes a technique for enhancing fairness across multiple protected groups using an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model, capable of being applied to diverse protected groups while improving the fairness of existing machine learning models. This technique comprises two modules: the MLP Protected group Allocation module, which predicts the protected group using MLP and allocates it to the original dataset, and the Fairness Evaluation module, which assesses group fairness. Fairness evaluation is conducted for both binary and multiple protected groups, utilizing fairness metrics based on equal opportunity and equal odds. Experiments utilized logistic regression, random forests, decision trees, and commonly used datasets in the fairness domain such as COMPAS and UCI Adult Census. The experiments demonstrated that merely modifying the protected groups in the data can enhance the group fairness of existing machine learning models."

The automotive industry is putting a lot of effort into improving injector targeting accuracy. To improve the targeting accuracy of injectors, it is necessary to develop models that can predict the spray targeting positions. When developing spray targeting models, the most used technique is computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Recently, due to the superiority of machine learning in prediction accuracy, the application of machine learning in this field is also receiving constant attention. The purpose of this study is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict spray targeting based on the design parameters of injectors. To achieve this goal, this study firstly used laser sheet beam visualization equipment to obtain many spray cross-sectional images of injectors with different parameters at different injection pressures and measurement planes. The spray images were processed by MATLAB code to get the targeting coordinates of sprays. A total of four models were used for the prediction of spray targeting coordinates, namely ANN, LSTM, Conv1D and Conv1D & LSTM. Features fed into the machine learning model include injector design parameters, injection conditions, and measurement planes. Labels to be output from the model are spray targeting coordinates. In addition, the spray data of 7 injectors were used for model training, and the spray data of the remaining one injector were used for model performance verification. Finally, the prediction performance of the model was evaluated by R2 and RMSE. It is found that the Conv1D&LSTM model has the highest accuracy in predicting the spray targeting coordinates, which can reach 98%. In addition, the prediction bias of the model becomes larger as the distance from the injector tip increases."

To achieve this, we intend to evaluate two factors that influence the prediction accuracy of the distribution model. In order to compare the prediction accuracy of the models based on biased location data in a specific region and based on the multicollinearity of environmental variables known as bioclimatic variables, the confirmed habitat locations of B. chalybea flavovittata were collected from the GBIF database, and 19 biological climate variables used as environmental variables were collected from the Worldclim database. The bias of the location data was examined using four types of data selected with a certain distance between the location data. The multicollinearity of the environmental variables was assessed using the Variation Inflation Factor (VIF). Preprocessed data were applied to seven species distribution models, and the prediction accuracy of the models was compared and analyzed using three evaluation metrics (Kappa, TSS, AUC). Among machine learning and regression models, seven distribution models were used for comparison. The machine learning models included Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and MaxEnt, while the regression models included Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). Overall, the prediction accuracy of the models was better explained by the Random Forest (RF) model, which is a machine learning method that better captures the complex relationship between species and environmental variables, compared to other models. The bias of location data, which is more commonly surveyed in easily accessible areas, affected the prediction accuracy in all models, while multicollinearity varied depending on the model. This study is expected to serve as fundamental guidance for developing an optimal species distribution model that aligns with the research objectives of species conservation and it can be utilized as foundational data for effective management of wildlife habitat in national parks."

Unlike previous dramas with the theme of school violence, The Glory is approaching the serious topic of school violence as a social problem from the structural level of the gap between the rich and the poor, rather than looking at it as an individual deviation problem. There is a big difference from past dramas about school violence.Since the crawling data used in this study contains only text files and does not reflect ratings and scores, the KNU Emotional Dictionary was used to classify positive and negative words, and if the score was negative, it was classified as negative/positive if it was processed. Based on machine learning logistic regression analysis, a model suitable for sentiment analysis was identified, and as a result, positive words and negative words were derived.What is particularly interesting is that the negative words include both “perpetrator” and “victim,” as well as “school” and “student.”To infer these negative emotional results, it is believed that the culture of our society still underlies the idea that ‘there is no such thing as bullying without a reason’ in the case of students who are ostracized by their friends or become victims of school violence. In addition, it was sad to see that the school was no longer a stage of hope and growth, but was perceived as a place of inequality and lack of protection.But this drama raises public anger against school violence in that it leads to accusation of the institutional laxity of Korean society, where the judicial system fails to punish assault victims and schools fail to protect disadvantaged students. It can be seen that the implications are very large in that it causes the effect of maintaining vigilance and interest."
Comparative Performance Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Hyperparameter Optimization Frameworks,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Neural networks', 'Hyperparameter optimization', 'Convolutional neural network']",,"Machine learning (ML) has proven to be highly effective in solving complex problems in various domains, thanks to its ability to identify specific data tasks, perform feature engineering, and learn quickly. However, designing and training ML models is a complicated task and requires optimization. The effectiveness of ML models is highly dependent on the selection of hyperparameters that determines their performance. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a systematic search process to find the optimal combinations of hyperparameters to achieve robust performance. Traditional HPO methods such as grid and random search take a lot of computing time when used in large-scale applications. Recently, various automated search strategies, such as Bayesian optimization (BO) and evolutionary algorithms, have been developed to significantly reduce the computing time. In this paper, we use state-of-the-art HPO frameworks, namely BO, Optuna, HyperOpt, and Keras Tuner, for optimizing the ML and deep learning models for the classification tasks and evaluate their comparative performance using two different sets of experiments. The first one uses different ML classifiers to solve the optimal parameter selection problem with HPO. The second one attempts to optimize the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using HPO frameworks to improve its performance in the image classification task.We use four publicly available real-world datasets including one image dataset. The experimental results show that HyperOpt -TPE outperforms the other HPO frameworks for the ML classifiers and achieves up to 94.12% of accuracy with 30 minutes for performing the optimization. Similarly, for the CNN model, HyperOpt-TPE outperforms the other HPO frameworks by improving 34% of the classification accuracy, while taking 2 hours and 24 minutes of computing time."

"Development, Validation and Comparison of Artificial Neural Network and Logistic Regression Models Predicting Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis With Nasal Polyps",2023,"['Machine learning', 'neural network models', 'biomarker', 'eosinophils', 'nasal polyps']",,"Purpose: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) can be classified into eosinophilic CRSwNP (eCRSwNP) and non-eosinophilic CRSwNP (non-eCRSwNP) by tissue biopsy, which is difficult to perform preoperatively. Clinical biomarkers have predictive value for the classification of CRSwNP. We aimed to evaluate the application of artificial neural network (ANN) modeling in distinguishing different endotypes of CRSwNP based on clinical biomarkers.Methods: Clinical parameters were collected from 109 CRSwNP patients, and their predictive ability was analyzed. ANN and logistic regression (LR) models were developed in the training group (72 patients) and further tested in the test group (37 patients). The output variable was the diagnosis of eCRSwNP, defined as tissue eosinophil count > 10 per high-power field. The receiver operating characteristics curve was used to assess model performance.Results: A total of 15 clinical features from 60 healthy controls, 60 eCRSwNP and 49 non-eCRSwNP were selected as candidate predictors. Nasal nitric oxide levels, peripheral eosinophil absolute count, total immunoglobulin E, and ratio of bilateral computed tomography scores for the ethmoid sinus and maxillary sinus were identified as important features for modeling. Two ANN models based on 4 and 15 clinical features were developed to predict eCRSwNP, which showed better performance, with the area under the receiver operator characteristics significantly higher than those from the respective LR models (0.976 vs. 0.902, P = 0.048; 0.970 vs. 0.845, P = 0.011). All ANN models had better fits than single variable prediction models (all P < 0.05), and ANN model 1 had the best predictive performance among all models.Conclusions: Machine learning models assist clinicians in predicting endotypes of nasal polyps before invasive detection. The ANN model has the potential to predict eCRSwNP with high sensitivity and specificity, and is superior to the LR model. ANNs are valuable for optimizing personalized patient management."

To overcome this, the Ministry of National Defense has emphasized the importance of management of the total life cycle system through Defense Reform 2020, and a project is being promoted to apply big-data-based state-based maintenance (CBM) in all areas of defense work. However, due to security regulations and the operation of analog facilities, data collection and use are limited, and it is difficult to apply big-data-based CBM. This research shows a case of constructing an abnormal detection model of an air dryer to prevent radar failure using the operation data of facilities that are not sufficiently secured due to the restrictions mentioned. An abnormal detection method is proposed for a weapon system under conditions with insufficient operation data and failure history. After acquiring normal operational data from six military units, an anomaly detection model was made using various anomaly detection techniques from unsupervised learning, and an optimal model was selected. In addition, an optimal threshold and alarm criteria were selected to decrease the false alarm rate in normal conditions for each unit and to detect abnormalities as quickly as possible. The results of this study confirmed the possibility of applying anomaly detection through AI application to another weapon system and laid the foundation of securing empirical cases, CBM models using AI, and data analysis techniques with actual operation data."

Many real-world tasks include high-dimensional data which reduces the performance of machine learning methods. To solve this issue, a filter and multi-label feature selection is proposed in this paper. The main idea of the proposed method is to choose highly relevant and non-redundant features with the lowest information loss. The proposed method first uses a novel graph-based density peaks clustering to group similar features to reach this goal. It then uses the ant colony optimization search process to rank features based on their relevancy to a set of labels and also their redundancy with the other features. A graph first represents the feature space, and then a novel density peaks clustering is used to group similar features. Then, the ants are searched through the graph to select a set of non-similar features by remaining in the clusters with a low probability and jumping among the clusters with a high probability. Moreover, in this paper, to evaluate the solutions found by the ants, a novel criterion based on mutual information was used to assign a high pheromone value to highly relevant and non-redundant features. Finally, the final features are chosen based on their pheromone values. The results of experiments on a set of real-world datasets show the superiority of the proposed method over a set of baseline and state-of-the-art methods."

장기 변동성을 반영하기 위한 확산 모델을 활용한 주가 지수 확률 분포 예측,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Time series forecasting', 'Stochastic differential equations', 'Financial time series', 'Stock market index', 'Probabilistic forecasting']",,"Many of the existing time series forecasting studies in stock market were statistical or machine learning methods based on point prediction. However, typical point forecasting methods fail to consider the distribution of data, which may ignore extreme market situations. This can be vulnerable especially for the long-term forecasting, given the high volatility in the stock market. To resolve the issue, we propose a stock index probabilistic distribution prediction framework based on the Denoising Diffusion Model, called StockGrad. Specifically, StockGrad adopt a sparse transformer encoder as feature extractor to yield zero probability for time steps that are less relevant to the prediction time step. For probability distribution prediction, our model transforms the white noise into the distribution of interest through the Markov chain using the TimeGrad time series generation methodology. Our proposed methodology can help investors make decisions on investment or risk management. Our experiments show that proposed StockGrad framework outperforms the existing deep learning probability models by about 3.71%, 1.53% and 1.71% on S&P500, NIKKEI225, and KOSPI200 stock index data sets, respectively. Also, it is experimentally demonstrated that using the sparse transformer encoder as a feature extractor captures historical time points related to predictive bulbs well, improve the performance of the long-term prediction."

For doing this, a total of 434,494 cases of national tax delinquents information, which were entrusted to KAMCO for consignment collecting between 2013 to 2022, were used for empirical analysis. As a result of this analysis, it was confirmed that several variables such as total amount of arrears, female or not, delinquent’s age were major factors to affect the possibility of payment of national tax delinquents, based on the Shapley Value. And also, it was found that the classification accuracy of XGBoost was about 10%p higher than that of the logistic regression model, and the F1 score also produced relatively excellent result.

In this paper, we suggest a new resource planning policy for real-time workloads that can be fluctuated over time in IoT systems. To handle such situations, we categorize real-time tasks into fixed tasks and variable tasks, and optimize the resource planning for various workload conditions.

At this time, the AI model is basically learned based on various statistical properties of the learning data and then distributed to the system, but unexpected changes in the data in a rapidly changing data situation cause a decrease in the model's performance. In particular, as it becomes important to find drift signals of deployed models in order to respond to new and unknown attacks that are constantly created in the security field, the need for lifecycle management of the entire model is gradually emerging.In general, it can be detected through performance changes in the model's accuracy and error rate (loss), but there are limitations in the usage environment in that an actual label for the model prediction result is required, and the detection of the point where the actual drift occurs is uncertain. there is. This is because the model's error rate is greatly influenced by various external environmental factors, model selection and parameter settings, and new input data, so it is necessary to precisely determine when actual drift in the data occurs based only on the corresponding value. There are limits to this. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to detect when actual drift occurs through an Anomaly analysis technique based on XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence). As a result of testing a classification model that detects DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm), anomaly scores were extracted through the SHAP(Shapley Additive exPlanations) Value of the data after distribution, and as a result, it was confirmed that efficient drift point detection was possible."

In this paper, we have compared several models of machine learning to predict about 30 measurements used in fashion industry to construct clothes from 6 easy-to-measure body dimensions and demographic information. The four types of models we have studied are linear regressions, random forests, gradient boosting trees and support vector regressions. To construct and train them we have used anthropometric measurements of 9000 adult individuals of the French population collected by the French Institute of Textiles and Clothing (IFTH) during a national measurement campaign collected between 2003 and 2005. We have analyzed the model prediction performance in terms of individual and global predictions as well as the effect of the training dataset size and the importance of the input features. The linear and the support vector regressions have given the best results with respect to evaluation metrics, predicted distributions and have required less training data than tree-based models. It turns out that the weight and height have been the most important input features for the models considered while the hip girth has been the less important among the input measurements. Since the set of body dimensions used in fashion industry and the morphology depend on the gender, we have decided to treat men and women separately and to compare them."

However, algorithms come with both advantages and risks. In other words, algorithms are used for the benefit of individuals and society, but at the same time contain the risk of promoting discrimination and inequality. This is also the case in the realm of criminal justice. Decisions made by data and algorithms bring speed, efficiency, and precision to law enforcement, but potentially contain the risk of reproducing existing prejudices and biases. Algorithms cannot be independent of humans because humans create, build, and operate algorithms based on data, but algorithmic decisions influence human decision-making. As a result, algorithms can be viewed as a technical collection with social characteristics rather than a technical or objective form of operation. These algorithms have been incorporated into the criminal justice field, affecting the law enforcement process, and changing the basic principles that govern criminal justice, but there is a lack of discussion on this. Therefore, with this recognition, this paper examines the current status and problems of algorithm use in criminal justice and suggests transparency, fairness, and accountability as principles of algorithm use in criminal justice."

To address this, “explainable AI,” which teaches AI functionalities to end-users, is important. This review presents the definitions, importance, and role of explainable AI, as well as potential challenges in emergency medicine. First, we introduce the terms explainability, interpretability, and transparency of AI models. These terms sound similar but have different roles in discussion of AI. Second, we indicate that explainable AI is required in clinical settings for reasons of justification, control, improvement, and discovery and provide examples. Third, we describe three major categories of explainability: pre-modeling explainability, interpretable models, and post-modeling explainability and present examples (especially for post-modeling explainability), such as visualization, simplification, text justification, and feature relevance. Last, we show the challenges of implementing AI and ML models in clinical settings and highlight the importance of collaboration between clinicians, developers, and researchers.

The fabrication process is complexly compound of several sub-processes, and thus even if an experienced engineer manages the process with precise equipment in a clean environment, it is difficult to make a wafer with no error-free dies. Therefore, the engineer should quickly discover which sub-process is mal-functioning for high yield. Fortunately, error dies make a specific defect pattern, which corresponds to specific abnormal operation of some fabrication sub-processes. Hence, a scheme that recognizes defect patterns in a wafer map can allow fabrication engineers to make the high-quality wafer with few error dies. In this paper, we implement a capsule network based multiple-defect recognition scheme with high precision and recall per each defect pattern.

The majority of previous studies, however, largely focused on the impact of machine translation (MT) on L2 writing. Building upon the theories and practices of pedagogical application of MT, and by adopting the concept of translanguaging that legitimises learners’ deployment of full linguistic repertoire including L1, this study explores Korean EFL learners’ perceptions of MT and frequent errors in English-into-Korean post-editing. According to the results of a survey and students’ self-reports of their experience with MT, the use of MT in EFL learning was perceived by the learners as an innovative and positive learning experience. The learners highly appreciated the use of MT in their reading practice and post-editing by pointing out that the use of MT reduces stress and increases motivation to learn English. This study also reveals that post-editing practice can help learners understand deficiencies in free online MT output and raise their awareness of the linguistic structure and subtleties of language."

Poor data quality can cause problems such as false alarms. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-step hybrid approach consisting of rules and machine learning models for quality control of data collected from slopes. The rule-based has the advantage of high accuracy and intuitive interpretation, and the machine learning model has the advantage of being able to derive patterns that cannot be explicitly expressed. The hybrid approach was able to take both of these advantages. Through a case study, the performance of using the two methods alone and the case of using the hybrid approach was compared, and the hybrid method was judged to have high performance. Therefore, it is judged that using a hybrid method is more appropriate than using the two methods alone for data quality control."

Unfortunately, it is often challenging to assess inflammation in NAFLD due to its dynamic nature and poor correlation with liver biochemical markers. Liver histology keeps its role as the standard tool, yet it is well-known for substantial sampling, intraobserver, and interobserver variability. Serum proinflammatory cytokines and apoptotic markers, namely cytokeratin-18, are well-studied with reasonable accuracy, whereas serum metabolomics and lipidomics have been adopted in some commercially available diagnostic models. Ultrasound and computed tomography imaging techniques are attractive due to their wide availability; yet their accuracies may not be comparable with magnetic resonance imaging-based tools. Machine learning and deep learning models, be they supervised or unsupervised learning, are promising tools to identify various subtypes of NAFLD, including those with dominating liver inflammation, contributing to sustainable care pathways for NAFLD."

At this time, the treatment effect of companies with low total debt and low investment activation was widely distributed, which can be attributed to the characteristics of venture companies that focus on investment and technological innovation and show various corporate forms."
R2NET: Storage and Analysis of Attack Behavior Patterns,2023,"['Cloud computing', 'Honeynet', 'Machine learning', 'R2NET', 'Zero-day attacks']",,"Cloud computing has evolved significantly, intending to provide users with fast, dependable, and low-cost services. With its development, malicious users have become increasingly capable of attacking both its internal and external security. To ensure the security of cloud services, encryption, authorization, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems have been employed. However, these single monitoring agents, are complex, time-consuming, and they do not detect ransomware and zero-day vulnerabilities on their own. An innovative Record and Replay-based hybrid Honeynet (R2NET) system has been developed to address this issue. Combining honeynet with Record and Replay (RR) technology, the system allows fine-grained analysis by delaying time-consuming analysis to the replay step. In addition, a machine learning algorithm is utilized to cluster the logs of attackers and store them in a database. So, the accessing time for analyzing the attack may be reduced which in turn increases the efficiency of the proposed framework. The R2NET framework is compared with existing methods such as EEHH net, HoneyDoc, Honeynet system, and AHDS. The proposed system achieves 7.60%, 9.78%%, 18.47%, and 31.52% more accuracy than EEHH net, HoneyDoc, Honeynet system, and AHDS methods."

Artificial intelligence applications and ethical challenges in oral and maxillo-facial cosmetic surgery: a narrative review,2023,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Orthognathic surgery', 'Rhinoplasty']",,"Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to using technologies to simulate human cognition to solve a specific problem. The rapid development of AI in the health sector has been attributed to the improvement of computing speed, exponential increase in data production, and routine data collection. In this paper, we review the current applications of AI for oral and maxillofacial (OMF) cosmetic surgery to provide surgeons with the fundamental technical elements needed to understand its potential. AI plays an increasingly important role in OMF cosmetic surgery in various settings, and its usage may raise ethical issues. In addition to machine learning algorithms (a subtype of AI), convolutional neural networks (a subtype of deep learning) are widely used in OMF cosmetic surgeries. Depending on their complexity, these networks can extract and process the elementary characteristics of an image. They are, therefore, commonly used in the diagnostic process for medical images and facial photos. AI algorithms have been used to assist surgeons with diagnosis, therapeutic decisions, preoperative planning, and outcome prediction and evaluation. AI algorithms complement human skills while minimizing shortcomings through their capabilities to learn, classify, predict, and detect. This algorithm should, however, be rigorously evaluated clinically, and a systematic ethical reflection should be conducted regarding data protection, diversity, and transparency. It is possible to revolutionize the practice of functional and aesthetic surgeries with 3D simulation models and AI models. Planning, decision-making, and evaluation during and after surgery can be improved with simulation systems. A surgical AI model can also perform timeconsuming or challenging tasks for surgeons."

Additionally, Republic of Korea has the lowest total fertility rate of 0.84 births per woman among OECD countries. The population decline in Korea is a significant challenge accompanied by population aging. However, there are some regions in the metropolitan area where population growth is observed. In this study, we aim to identify the key factors influencing population change using machine learning analysis. The factors consider include population composition by age group and various social factors such as employment, housing, culture, health-care, and welfare at the community level. The analysis results show that changes in population size in the age groups of 50∼54 and 45∼50 had a high degree of influence on the change in the population of the region. These age groups have a high proportion in the population composition of Korea and are associated with active economic activities in the working-age population. On the other hand, age groups with older individuals have less influence on population change. In terms of regional characteristics, the analysis reveals that the supply of housing, particularly apartments, had a strong impact on population change. The availability of apartments indicates not only increases housing supply but also the development of convenient facilities and job creation.

Therefore, we determine whether a particular population of individuals with mobile devices or other utility devices needs recommendations for coffee shops in a particular area. This was achieved by creating a Coffee Shop recommendation system, which uses geotagging to pinpoint the location dependent on latitude and longitude.

BERT’s methodology, a machine learning method developed by Google, was used to measure managerial optimism for companies listed on KSE (Korea Stock Exchange) and KOSDAQ from 2009 to 2019. Optimism, when there are capital constraints of companies, is defined as overconfidence, and unlike previous studies, the meaning of managerial optimism and overconfidence is distinguished. The empirical analysis revealed the following: higher the manager’s optimism, higher the cash flow, smaller the size of the firm, larger the debt ratio and lastly, higher the growth potential, higher the investment. Furthermore, in analyzing the relationship between performance and investment, higher optimism and investment was associated with higher corporate performance. Finally, when a company is in a capital constraint state, it was found that managerial optimism negatively affected corporate performance. These findings are consistent with previous studies that showed that more optimistic managers have higher investment and that excessive optimism is not good for corporate value."
Design and Implementation of a Body Fat Classification Model using Human Body Size Data,2023,"['Classification', 'CNN', 'fat rate percentage', 'human body size', 'K-means clustering']",,"Recently, as various examples of machine learning have been applied in the healthcare field, deep learning technology has been applied to various tasks, such as electrocardiogram examination and body composition analysis using wearable devices such as smart watches.

A temporal–spatiotemporal domain transformation-based modeling method for nonlinear distributed parameter systems,2023,"['spatiotemporal modeling', 'kernel-based extreme learning machine', 'distributed parameter system', 'strong nonlinearity', 'locally linear embedding']",,"Complex nonlinear distributed parameter systems (DPSs) exist widely in advanced industrial thermal processes. The modeling of such highly nonlinear systems is a challenge for traditional time/space-separation-based methods since they employ linear methods for the model reduction and spatiotemporal reconstruction, which may lead to an inefficient application of the nonlinear spatial structure features represented by the spatial basis functions. To overcome this problem, a novel spatiotemporal modeling framework composed of nonlinear temporal domain transformation and nonlinear spatiotemporal domain reconstruction is proposed in this paper. Firstly, local nonlinear dimension reduction based on the locally linear embedding technique is utilized to perform nonlinear temporal domain transformation of the spatiotemporal output of nonlinear DPSs. In this step, the original spatiotemporal data can be directly transformed into low-order time coefficients. Then, the extreme learning machine (ELM) method is utilized to establish a temporal model. Finally, through the spatiotemporal domain reconstruction based on the kernel-based ELM method, the prediction of the temporal dynamics obtained from the temporal model can be reconstructed back to the spatiotemporal output. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed method are demonstrated in experiments on the thermal processes of a snap curing oven and a lithium-ion battery."

To resolve this issue, we propose a supervised learning method to improve accuracy of the noise review filtering for the places with insufficient reviews. In the proposed method, training is not performed by an individual place, but by a group including several places with similar characteristics. The classifier obtained through the training can be used for the noise review filtering of an arbitrary place belonging to the group, so the problem of insufficient training data can be resolved. To verify the proposed method, a noise review filtering model was implemented using LSTM and BERT, and filtering accuracy was checked through experiments using real data collected online. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed method was 92.4% on the average, and it provided 87.5% accuracy when targeting places with less than 100 reviews."

However, each feature does not always change uniformly over the entire interval but sometimes changes locally. Therefore, we propose a multi-time window feature extraction technique that can extract both global and local features, from long-term to short-term. In addition, we also propose an ensemble model that consists of multiple classifiers. Each classifier is trained with features extracted from different multi-time windows. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction technique and ensemble model, a public three-dimensional gait dataset was used.

Miscibility of the polymer blends can be used to assess polymer–polymer interactions for effective scaffold engineering and cell–material interactions. The focus of this study was to apply machine learning (ML) methods to classify and predict the miscibility of polymer blends, namely poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-valerate)/fucoidan (PHBV/FUC), polyhydroxybutyrate/kappa-carrageenan (PHB/KCG), and cellulose acetate/polyamide (CA/PA). Physicochemical parameters assessed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis, and mechanical properties were used as input data. Depending on blend film compositions, the polymers were either partially miscible or completely immiscible. Six supervised classification algorithms were trained on the data with Scikit-learn. The random forest classifier outperformed the other algorithms with the optimal performance metrics. A simple multiple linear regression model was applied to polymer–drug interaction data.

However, these methods have a the disadvantage of not being able to measure pulp blood flow, so laser Doppler technology has been developed to measure fine blood flow. In this paper, we propose a portable device that can acquire pulp blood flow signals at the chair-side using an interface that can stably attach sensors to various tooth shapes and a cost-effective photoplethysmogram technology. In addition, a machine learning classification model was trained and tested using the data collected by the device and it was confirmed that the classification performance of the pulp vitality was high in the nearest neighbor algorithm."
Special Quantum Steganalysis Algorithm for Quantum Secure Communications Based on Quantum Discriminator,2023,"['Quantum computing', 'quantum discriminator', 'quantum machine learning', 'quantum steganalysis', 'quantum steganography']",,"The remarkable advancement of quantum steganography offers enhanced security for quantum communications. However, there is a significant concern regarding the potential misuse of this technology. Moreover, the current research on identifying malicious quantum steganography is insufficient. To address this gap in steganalysis research, this paper proposes a specialized quantum steganalysis algorithm. This algorithm utilizes quantum machine learning techniques to detect steganography in general quantum secure communication schemes that are based on pure states. The algorithm presented in this paper consists of two main steps: data preprocessing and automatic discrimination. The data preprocessing step involves extracting and amplifying abnormal signals, followed by the automatic detection of suspicious quantum carriers through training on steganographic and non-steganographic data. The numerical results demonstrate that a larger disparity between the probability distributions of steganographic and non-steganographic data leads to a higher steganographic detection indicator, making the presence of steganography easier to detect. By selecting an appropriate threshold value, the steganography detection rate can exceed 90%."

The algorithms used include a mixed model that incorporates random effects, primarily used in the panel data. Additionally, there are general statistical models and machine learning models that do not incorporate random effects. Based on the size of the panel data, panel, non-panel, linear-based, tree-based, and neural network-based models were compared. For each type, predictive performance rankings were derived. The analysis revealed that as the time period increased, the performance of the panel model improved in comparison to that of the nonpanel model. Additionally, the size of the customer did not have a significant impact. Furthermore, the performance of the base model was compared based on size. Based on the size of the panel data, it is expected that the appropriate model can be easily determined using these results. This study is significant because it establishes the effectiveness of the predictive models that can be applied to the panel data, which is typically challenging to analyze because of its size."

A quality by design approach in oral extended release drug delivery systems: where we are and where we are going?,2023,"['Design of experiments', 'Extended release', 'Machine learning', 'Multivariate data analysis', 'Process analytical technology', 'Quality by design']",,"Background Oral extended release (ER) delivery systems have quickly gained increasing importance because of their ability to maintain drug levels in the blood more consistently, reducing side effects and improving patient compliance. The complexity of ER formulation leads to additional development challenges in the fulfilment of quality-related regulatory requirements.Despite their challenging properties, the potential of ER system formulation and process development can be better exploited by applying quality by design (QbD) approaches and advanced modeling techniques such as machine learning (ML).Area covered This review provides a comprehensive overview of QbD concepts applied to oral ER delivery systems, clarifying the impact of raw materials and process variables on critical quality attributes (CQAs). Moreover, data science coupled with ML algorithms is also elucidated in this article as a potential tool for predicting and optimizing ER formulation design and manufacturing processes.Expert opinion QbD, as a scientific and risk-based approach, provides a comprehensive understanding of oral ER drug delivery systems improving product quality and reducing postapproval changes. Enabling QbD with ML-driven pharmaceutical development can provide an opportunity to move toward risk mitigation for efficient ER tablet formulation and process development. However, there are some barriers to overcome in the way of adopting QbD concepts. The key issues are the lack of understanding and the gap between industries and regulatory authorities concerning the scientific principles and terms beyond QbD, which can create an obstacle during the approval process. Furthermore, it is generally believed that the resources and time invested in applying QbD tools are not cost-effective during constant and continuous improvement.Today, it is time to realize that a multidisciplinary understanding of the formulation and manufacturing process is as important as achieving the final result."

Development of a Framework for Improvement of Sensor Data Quality from Weather Buoys,2023,"['Weather Buoy', 'Data Quality Management', 'Machine Learning', 'Data Fault Detection', 'Data Interpolation']",,"In this study, we focus on the improvement of data quality transmitted from a weather buoy that guides a route of ships. The buoy has an Internet-of-Thing (IoT) including sensors to collect meteorological data and the buoy’s status, and it also has a wireless communication device to send them to the central database in a ground control center and ships nearby. The time interval of data collected by the sensor is irregular, and fault data is often detected. Therefore, this study provides a framework to improve data quality using machine learning models. The normal data pattern is trained by machine learning models, and the trained models detect the fault data from the collected data set of the sensor and adjust them. For determining fault data, interquartile range (IQR) removes the value outside the outlier, and an NGBoost algorithm removes the data above the upper bound and below the lower bound. The removed data is interpolated using NGBoost or long-short term memory (LSTM) algorithm. The performance of the suggested process is evaluated by actual weather buoy data from Korea to improve the quality of ‘AIR_TEMPERATURE’ data by using other data from the same buoy. The performance of our proposed framework has been validated through computational experiments based on real-world data, confirming its suitability for practical applications in re- al-world scenarios."

In particular, research using machine learning as well as existing detection methods is increasing for ransomware detection and response. However, traditional machine learning has a problem in that it is difficult to extract accurate predictions because the model tends to predict in the direction where there is a lot of data. Accordingly, in an imbalance class consisting of a large number of non-Ransomware (normal code or malware) and a small number of Ransomware, a technique for resolving the imbalance and improving ransomware detection performance is proposed. In this experiment, we use two scenarios (Binary, Multi Classification) to confirm that the sampling technique improves the detection performance of a small number of classes while maintaining the detection performance of a large number of classes. In particular, the proposed mixed sampling technique (SMOTE+ENN) resulted in a performance(G-mean, F1-score) improvement of more than 10%."

In particular, instant messaging applications for real-time communication are widely used among social media. However, crimes such as image manipulation, leakage of confidential information, and sharing of pornography are also occurring through these applications. Since investigations require identifying the source of these illegally shared multimedia files, many studies have been conducted to identify the source of transmitted images through various social media. However, existing studies detect image sources by signatureizing image metadata, so there is a limitation in that it is difficult to detect even if the metadata changes slightly. In addition, existing studies that classify images using machine learning had relatively low classification accuracy by using a small type of metadata or only a DCT coefficient as a feature and using a single model. In this paper, a method is proposed to classify the source application of an image by extracting the metadata of an image transmitted from an instant messaging application and training the extracted metadata with a machine learning model. Experiments were conducted on a total of 16 applications, and it was shown that the source application could be classified with an accuracy of 98% or higher. If the method proposed in this paper is used in digital forensic investigations, it can help identify sources for illegally shared multimedia files through instant messaging applications to understand the circumstances of events or form detailed timelines."

This study performed a DTW 132 times in total (male= 62, female= 62) for the flexion angle of the right leg’s hip, knee, and ankle joints. Then, the global cost and the RMSE of the optimal warping paths were calculated and normalized. The difference analysis was performed by independent t-test. Machine learning was performed to test the classification performance using the neural network, support vector machine, and logistic regression model among the supervised models. Results analyzed using global cost and RMSE for hip, knee, and ankle joints showed a statistically significant difference between genders in global cost and RMSE for hip and knee joints but not for ankle joints using RMSE.

Then, to facilitate effective supervisory feedback and coaching, it would be useful for organizations to monitor the contents of feedback exchanges between supervisors and employees to make sure that supervisors are providing performance feedback using languages that are more likely to be perceived as interpersonally fair. Computer-aided text analysis holds potential as a useful tool that organizations can use to efficiently monitor the quality of the feedback messages that supervisors provide to their employees. In the current study, we applied computer-aided text analysis (using closed-vocabulary text analysis) and machine learning to examine the validity of language-based algorithms trained on supervisor language in performance feedback situations for predicting human ratings of feedback interpersonal fairness. Results showed that language-based algorithms predicted feedback interpersonal fairness with reasonable level of accuracy.

Second, according to the principles of aviation noise prediction models, this paper classifies these existing models into three categories: best practice models, scientific models, and machine learning models. Relevant academic research results are summarized. The best practice model regards the aircraft as noise point source, and its specialty is to predict noise under complex air traffic conditions. The scientific model considers the noise from the level of aircraft components and reflects the underlying physical effects. Based on data, the machine learning model uses algorithms to mine the hidden relationship between various factors and noise to achieve the purpose of noise prediction. Then, this paper introduces two kinds of aviation noise simulation software based on the best practice and scientific models, and lists their access addresses. Finally, challenges and prospects are presented from three aspects: metrics, prediction models and simulation software."

Feature construction for on-board early prediction of electric vehicle battery cycle life,2023,"['Lithium-ion Battery', 'Cycle Life Prediction', 'Feature Construction', 'Machine Learning']",,"As the worldwide environmental crisis worsens, electric vehicles (EVs) are establishing themselves as ecofriendly alternatives to conventional fossil fuel vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are a typical source of energy for EVs, but it is important to predict their life in order to ensure safe and optimal operation. However, because LIBs degrade in a nonlinear fashion and their state of health varies depending on operating conditions, achieving fast and accurate cycle life prediction has been a challenge. More importantly, on-board estimation is necessary because even the identical battery cells manufactured by the same company vary in their cycle lifetimes and operational characteristics, which we cannot specify in advance.

For a more accurate prediction in contact-based CMP, it is necessary to consider the real-time changing pad surface roughness during polishing. Changes in pad surface roughness result in non-uniformity of the real contact pressure and friction applied to the wafer, which are the main causes of material removal rate variation. In this paper, we predicted the material removal rate based on pressure and surface roughness using a deep neural network (DNN). Reduced peak height (Rpk) and real contact area (RCA) were chosen as the key parameters indicative of the surface roughness of the pad, and 220 data were collected along with the process pressure. The collected data were normalized and separated in a 3 : 1 : 1 ratio to improve the predictive performance of the DNN model. The hyperparameters of the DNN model were optimized through random search techniques and 5 cross-validations. The optimized DNN model predicted the material removal rate with high accuracy in ex-situ CMP. This study is expected to be utilized in data-driven machine learning decision making for cyber-physical CMP systems in the future."

Labeling strategy to improve neutron/gamma discrimination with organic scintillator,2023,"['Neutron gamma discrimination', 'Time-of-flight', 'Labeling approach', 'Plastic scintillator', 'Organic scintillator', 'Machine learning']",,"Organic scintillators are widely used for neutron/gamma detection. Pulse shape discrimination algorithms have been commonly used to discriminate the detected radiations. These algorithms have several limits, in particular with plastic scintillator which has lower discrimination ability, compared to liquid scintillator.

Finite element model updating based on response reconstruction using a modified Kalman filter,2023,['· Model updating · Response reconstruction · Modified Kalman filter algorithm · Mode shape prediction · Extreme learning machine'],,"To overcome the incomplete measurement and ill-posed problem in model updating, the response reconstruction technique is introduced into finite element model updating (FEMU). The unmeasured responses can be reconstructed by a few responses at measured positions applying the modified Kalman filter (MKF) algorithm. In the reconstruction process, the LWOA-ELM model, an extreme learning machine (ELM) model optimized by Lévy whale optimization algorithm (LWOA), is adopted to predict mode shapes. The objective function’s goal is to reduce the disparity between the analytical responses and the reconstructed responses. And LWOA is additionally utilized to get the updating results. Numerical simulations of a three-dimensional truss structure, a seven-story steel frame model, and a test study of a cantilever beam are employed to validate the methodology, respectively. The results indicate that MKF can effectively estimate the unknown external excitation and state vectors. The proposed strategy for FEMU based on response reconstruction is feasible and applicable to achieve a better solution."

Using artificial intelligence to detect human errors in nuclear power plants: A case in operation and maintenance,2023,"['human error detection', 'anomaly detection', 'nuclear power plants', 'machine learning']",,"Human error (HE) is an important concern in safety-critical systems such as nuclear power plants (NPPs).HE has played a role in many accidents and outage incidents in NPPs. Despite the increased automation in NPPs, HE remains unavoidable. Hence, the need for HE detection is as important as HE prevention efforts. In NPPs, HE is rather rare. Hence, anomaly detection, a widely used machine learning technique for detecting rare anomalous instances, can be repurposed to detect potential HE. In this study, we develop an unsupervised anomaly detection technique based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to detect anomalies in manually collected surveillance data in NPPs. More specifically, our GAN is trained to detect mismatches between automatically recorded sensor data and manually collected surveillance data, and hence, identify anomalous instances that can be attributed to HE. We test our GAN on both a real-world dataset and an external dataset obtained from a testbed, and we benchmark our results against state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, including one-class support vector machine and isolation forest.

Application of hierarchical symbolic fuzzy entropy and sparse Bayesian ELM to bearing fault diagnosis,2023,['· Fault diagnosis · Hierarchical symbolic fuzzy entropy · Sparse Bayesian extreme learning machine · Multi-scale symbolic fuzzy entropy'],,"Bearing fault diagnosis is essential for reducing equipment operating and maintenance costs. We propose a bearing fault diagnosis method that combines hierarchical symbolic fuzzy entropy (HSFE) and sparse Bayesian extreme learning machine (SBELM). Multiscale symbolic fuzzy entropy (MSFE) is a recently proposed fault diagnosis method. Compared with multiscale sample entropy (MSE), multiscale permutation entropy (MPE), and multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE), MSFE has high noise resistance and computational efficiency. The multiscale analysis method using the average operator can only extract information in the low frequency component, but cannot use the feature information in the high frequency component.Aiming at this defect, symbolic fuzzy entropy is formed by combining the hierarchical decomposition with the symbolic fuzzy entropy. Hierarchical decomposition uses average and difference operators to decompose the sequence, which can extract the fault information of highfrequency and low-frequency components at the same time. Then, the extracted fault information is efficiently identified and classified using the SBELM. The effectiveness and superiority of the HSFE method are verified by simulation signals and experimental vibration signals. At the same time, experimental comparisons were carried out using MPE, HPE, MSE, HSE, MSFE and HSFE. The experimental results indicate that the HSFE method has the best effect on the identification of rotating machinery fault types."

For this, an airborne optical sectioning (AOS) and synthesizing technique is newly adapted for the purpose of preliminary data processing. Specifically, the proposed algorithm consists of several image processing stages. In a foliage-rich environment, the majority of an image may be occupied by trees, where it is difficult to detect a person hidden under foliage. To resolve this, the preprocessing stage in the HSV color space removes the tree parts while preserving the person, and the processed images are combined to construct the AOS, which reveals the person hidden under the trees. Then the exposed person is identified using the machine learning technique that accurately recognizes human shapes. Consequently, the proposed optical sectioning and synthetic process suggests to expand the application field of typical vision-based mission system under complex airborne environment. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through the airborne data from a high fidelity process-in-the-loop simulator, where sensor and vision measurement are constructed and provided to a level of practical flight environment."

It highlights the potential for providing assistive solutions in such situations. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach using speech imagery of sentences, a technique where one imagines speeching without actually producing sound. The study collected electroencephalography(EEG) data from healthy participants and compared it with data collected during speech imagery generation. The study employed a dataset comprising four affirmative class sentences and four negative class sentences to conduct the experiment, utilizing two classifiers and two deep learning techniques for analysis. The results revealed that the classification accuracy for the affirmative class sentences was highest when employing regularized linear discriminant analysis(RLDA), while the classification accuracy for the negative class sentences was highest when using support vector machine(SVM). Although the study was conducted with a sample of healthy participants, it underscores the potential of speech imagery as a bidirectional communication modality for individuals who are unable to speak. Furthermore, this research represents a promising avenue for future investigations, focusing on decoding the intended messages of a select population with communication impairments."

Predicting emergency response volume can help law enforcement agencies efficiently allocate police resources to high-risk areas and dates, thereby preventing crime. However, it is also important to understand the factors that contribute to high call volume on specific dates and times. Police officers may have a sense of whether call volume will be high or low based on their experience and intuition. Similarly, the general public may make assumptions about which factors contribute to higher call volumes. In fact, there is a significant difference in call volume between holidays and weekdays, as several studies have confirmed that holidays have a significant impact on call volume. However, clear variables can reduce the impact of other variables on the prediction model and can become the sole criterion for all predictions. Additionally, variables with relatively low variability may not have a significant impact on call volume prediction. For these reasons, it is important to understand the impact of each variable on prediction results, select the necessary variables for predicting 112 emergency calls, and understand why the model selects certain variables to build an effective prediction model. Through this study, we can examine the key variables that influence the model and their explanatory power, and provide the essential variables needed to construct a 112 emergency call prediction model, without relying solely on model performance improvement."

This is especially significant in public buildings and libraries, where the spatial structure and visual accessibility in emergency evacuations play a critical role. Although China has the largest number of public libraries in the world, their evacuation structures' characteristics are not fully reflected, leading to fire safety issues. Therefore, the aim of this study is to objectively analyze the spatial structure and visual accessibility of Chinese public libraries through the lens of Space Syntax theory, based on the principles of wayfinding behavior. Moreover, by comparing libraries from different construction periods, the study seeks to understand the changes in spatial functionality and wayfinding convenience of public libraries over time. (Method)The study organized the concepts of relevant variables and constructed a research model through theoretical exploration and prior research. Furthermore, based on the standards of first-class libraries in China, Dongguan Library in Guangdong Province, Jinling Library, Nanjing Library, Dongtai Library, and Shanghai Library were selected as research subjects for Space Syntax analysis. The data obtained through DepthMapX and VGA methods were analyzed using SPSS statistical software, revealing the impact of spatial structure clarity and visual accessibility on wayfinding behavior in public libraries. (Results)The elements of ""structural clarity"" and ""visual accessibility"" as ease-of-wayfinding factors positively influenced the understanding of public library spaces. Analysis of cases over time showed that public libraries built after 2010, compared to those built before 2010, exhibited an increasing trend in structural clarity and visual accessibility. This suggests easier wayfinding and enhanced spatial understanding. Spaces with specific functions such as children's areas, disabled loan rooms, and comprehensive service desks on the ground floor showed a decreasing trend in structural clarity and visual accessibility. However, spaces with relatively fixed functions like public e-reading rooms, study areas, book and magazine lending zones, and offices showed an increasing trend in these aspects. (Conclusions)The purpose of this study is to address spatial digitization by capturing the data characteristics of public library spaces and providing quantitative public space data for design methods influenced by data technology. Additionally, to enhance wayfinding convenience in public library spaces, it aims to identify core elements applicable as design factors in public libraries and proposes guidelines for wayfinding convenience. This meaningful attempt is hoped to serve as foundational information for future data-driven design support in public building wayfinding convenience."

In this study, evaluation indicators that can evaluate the natural and human environments were derived, and the distribution patterns for each indicator were analyzed. Afterwards, by applying Self-Organizing Map (SOM) analysis, one of the unsupervised learning analysis methods, districts with similar characteristics were derived in Taeanhaean National Park, and the characteristics of each district were analyzed. As a result of the study, 7 districts with different characteristics were derived in Taeanhaean National Park, and by examining the contribution of each indicator together, it was possible to reveal that each district had different representative characteristics even though it was an adjacent area. This study evaluated natural parks by comprehensively considering the indicators of the natural and human environments. In addition, the SOM method used in the study is meaningful in that it can provide scientific and objective grounds for the existing zoning and apply it to the management plan."

There was a significant difference in the students’ grammar scores assessed by Grammarly depending on the degree of using the translator. About 80% of students were satisfied with the experience of using the translators in class. More than two-thirds of students agreed to use translators in class. Students actively used the translator to learn English, and the translator positively helped learners learn English. Rather than outright banning students from using translators, it may be better to teach how to use a translator so that students can use the translator properly as a learning tool to increase the learning effect."

However, the number of identified variants with pathogenicity information is quite small. A method for predicting the pathogenicity of variants by machine learning was proposed to address this problem. In this study, we apply and compare deep neural networks with random forests and logistic regression, which have been widely used in previous studies, to predict variant pathogenicity. The experimental data consisted of 1,068 single-nucleotide variants in genes associated with hereditary cancers. Experiments on 100 random data-sets generated for hyperparameter selection showed that random forests performed best in terms of area under the precision-recall curve. On 15 holdout gene data-sets, deep neural networks performed best on average, but the difference in performance from the second-best random forest was not significant. Logistic regression was also statistically significantly worse than that of either model.In conclusion, we found that deep neural networks and random forests were generally better than logistic regression at predicting the pathogenicity of single-nucleotide variants associated with hereditary cancer."
Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease using Wrapper Feature Selection Method,2023,"['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Early Mild Cognitive impairment', 'Late Mild Cognitive Impairment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Restricted Boltzmann Machine']",,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) symptoms are being treated by early diagnosis, where we can only slow the symptoms and research is still undergoing. In consideration, using T1-weighted images several classification models are proposed in Machine learning to identify AD. In this paper, we consider the improvised feature selection, to reduce the complexity by using wrapping techniques and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). This present work used the subcortical and cortical features of 278 subjects from the ADNI dataset to identify AD and sMRI. Multi-class classification is used for the experiment i.e., AD, EMCI, LMCI, HC. The proposed feature selection consists of Forward feature selection, Backward feature selection, and Combined PCA & RBM. Forward and backward feature selection methods use an iterative method starting being no features in the forward feature selection and backward feature selection with all features included in the technique. PCA is used to reduce the dimensions and RBM is used to select the best feature without interpreting the features. We have compared the three models with PCA to analysis. The following experiment shows that combined PCA &RBM, and backward feature selection give the best accuracy with respective classification model RF i.e., 88.65, 88.56% respectively."

The direct measurement method of tool wear using image and optical sensors is more accurate than indirect measurement, but it is mainly used to measure the amount of wear because it is difficult to apply in real time. Existing studies have been conducted mainly on flank wear caused by friction with workpiece. On the other hand, crater wear is an important monitoring factor because it is caused by friction with chips generated during processing and causes sudden tool breakage. However, for crater wear, it is difficult to measure the amount of wear because the indicator of the amount of wear is depth. Therefore, although image processing-based studies have been conducted to measure the amount of crater wear, there is a clear limit to accurately measure the depth only with the image on the top of the tool. In this work, we propose a method to extract unique features of crater wear images through autoencoder, a deep learning technique, and use them as a new measure of wear."

Based on these construction risks, the method of calculating the construction period of the construction project is mainly made by subjective judgment that relies on supervisor experience. In addition, unreasonable shortening construction to meet construction project schedules delayed by construction delays and construction disasters causes negative consequences such as poor construction, and economic losses are caused by the absence of infrastructure due to delayed schedules. Data-based scientific approaches and statistical analysis are needed to solve the risks of such construction projects. Data collected in actual construction projects is stored in unstructured text, so to apply data-based risks, data pre-processing involves a lot of manpower and cost, so basic data through a data classification model using text mining is required. Therefore, in this study, a document-based data generation classification model for risk management was developed through a data classification model based on SVM (Support Vector Machine) by collecting construction project documents and utilizing textmining. Through quantitative analysis through future research results, it is expected that risk management will be possible by being used as efficient and objective basic data for construction project process management."

Relying solely on the economic value of these information security products may lead to inaccuracies in evaluating the firm's financial performance. To address this issue, we propose an alternative method that focuses on analyzing the information security firm's strategic dynamics over time. This proposed approach takes into account the dynamics of the information security technology industry. Our central argument is that the value of an information security firm is closely tied to its ability to adapt persistently and swiftly to emerging information security demands. To measure these strategic dynamics, we employ machine learning techniques. In our study, we examine the relationship between the strategic dynamics of information security firms and their capital and sales market firm value. To do so, we utilize a panel dataset and employ both machine learning and econometric approaches for analysis. By adopting this methodology, we aim to provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the financial value of information security firms in the industry. In this research, we employ publicly available data from sources like WRDS, USPTO, LexisNexis database, encompassing capital market information, news, and magazine articles from December 2005 to January 2017."

However, the emergence of deep neural networks powered by deep learning has introduced a transformative era in art, representing a crucial inflection point. This development caused controversy over creativity and copyright. Due to AI's nature of producing results solely through creation, without considering the understanding and appreciation of art, there remains an unresolved question of whether it can genuinely comprehend human emotions and aesthetic reactions. This paper aims to explore the potential of AI in understanding art beyond its creative capabilities. We delve into the mechanisms and disparities between human and AI comprehension of art. The basic experiment yielded positive results, confirming that the recognition performance can be significantly enhanced, reaching a maximum accuracy of 98.7% or higher. The improvement was contingent upon the learning method employed and the level of data labeling, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of different approaches. However, it was observed that the recognition performance experienced a decline to 92.8% as the complexity of the configuration increased, indicating potential limitations and challenges in handling intricate setups. The primary objective of this study was to propose essential tasks for advancing artificial intelligence research in achieving a human-like understanding of art. By outlining these tasks, the study aimed to provide a roadmap for the future development of artificial intelligence in the field of artistic comprehension."

First, the Korea Meteorological Satellite Center’s GK2A daytime fog detection algorithm isutilized to detect fog, considering various optical and physical characteristics. In the second step, GK2Bdata is extrapolated to 10-min intervals by matching GK2A pixels based on the closest time and locationwhen GK2B observes the KorPen. For reflectance, GK2B normalized visible (NVIS) is corrected usingGK2A NVIS of the same time, considering the difference in wavelength range and observation geometry.GK2B NVIS is extrapolated at 10-min intervals using the 10-min changes in GK2A NVIS.

However, machine learning models require a relatively large amount of computation for construction and operation, and as a result, there is a high possibility that errors for actual data will increase due to overfitting. In this paper, we propose a solar power generation prediction model using multiple linear regression analysis and meteorological information closely related to power generation. The proposed prediction model collected solar power generation data and meteorological data collected for 149 hours and analyzed the correlation between each meteorological variable and power generation.

Therefore, there is a continuous need for research on methods for detecting content polluters. Detection methods using supervised learning techniques of machine learning such as Random Forest and Naive Bayes in the past show relatively high classification accuracy of 98% or more. However, in order to create a learning model, a process of generating training data by identifying features from original data and extracting feature values is required. The identified features represent the characteristics of the classification group well, and the greater the number of features, the higher the classification accuracy. However, the large number of identified features reduces the efficiency of generating a learning model when considering the time required to extract feature values. In order to search for the minimum set of feature combinations that guarantees a certain level of accuracy performance and can improve efficiency, this paper describes a method for searching for minimum scale feature combinations using feature importance, chi-square distribution, and PCA analysis.

An AutoML-driven Antenna Performance Prediction Model in the Autonomous Driving Radar Manufacturing Process,2023,"['Multi-output Regression', 'Antenna Performance Prediction', 'AutoML']",,"This paper proposes an antenna performance prediction model in the autonomous driving radar manufacturing process. Our research work is based upon a challenge dataset, Driving Radar Manufacturing Process Dataset, and a typical AutoML machine learning workflow engine, Pycaret open-source Python library. Note that the dataset contains the total 70 data-items, out of which 54 used as input features and 16 used as output features, and the dataset is properly built into resolving the multi-output regression problem. During the data regression analysis and preprocessing phase, we identified several input features having similar correlations and so detached some of those input features, which may become a serious cause of the multicollinearity problem that affect the overall model performance. In the training phase, we train each of output-feature regression models by using the AutoML approach. Next, we selected the top 5 models showing the higher performances in the AutoML result reports and applied the ensemble method so as for the selected models’ performances to be improved. In performing the experimental performance evaluation of the regression prediction model, we particularly used two metrics, MAE and RMSE, and the results of which were 0.6928 and 1.2065, respectively. Additionally, we carried out a series of experiments to verify the proposed model’s performance by comparing with other existing models’ performances. In conclusion, we enhance accuracy for safer autonomous vehicles, reduces manufacturing costs through AutoML-Pycaret and machine learning ensembled model, and prevents the production of faulty radar systems, conserving resources. Ultimately, the proposed model holds significant promise not only for antenna performance but also for improving manufacturing quality and advancing radar systems in autonomous vehicles."

The apple-sorting machine is composed of an arm-rest, a main body, and a height-adjustable part, and uses object detection through a machine learning technology called ‘You Only Look Once (YOLO)’ to sort the apples. The machine was initially trained using apple image data, RoboFlow, and Google Colab, and the resulting images were analyzed using Jetson Nano. An algorithm was developed to link the Jetson Nano outputs and the conveyor belt to classify the analyzed apple images. This apple-sorting machine can immediately sort and exclude apples with surface defects, thereby reducing the time needed to sort the fruit and, accordingly, achieving cuts in labor costs.Furthermore, the apple-sorting machine can produce uniform quality sorting with a high level of accuracy compared with the subjective judgment of manual sorting by eye.

However, research on the toxicity and harmfulness of chemicals generated by 3D printing is insufficient, and the performance of toxicity prediction using in silico techniques is limited due to missing molecular structure data. In this study, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model based on data-centric AI approach was developed to predict the toxicity of new 3D printing materials by imputing missing values in molecular descriptors.First, MissForest algorithm was utilized to impute missing values in molecular descriptors of hazardous 3D printing materials. Then, based on four different machine learning models (decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, SVM), a machine learning (ML)-based QSAR model was developed to predict the bioconcentration factor (Log BCF), octanol-air partition coefficient (Log Koa), and partition coefficient (Log P). Furthermore, the reliability of the data-centric QSAR model was validated through the Tree-SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method, which is one of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. The proposed imputation method based on the MissForest enlarged approximately 2.5 times more molecular structure data compared to the existing data. Based on the imputed dataset of molecular descriptor, the developed data-centric QSAR model achieved approximately 73%, 76% and 92% of prediction performance for Log BCF, Log Koa, and Log P, respectively. Lastly, Tree-SHAP analysis demonstrated that the data-centric-based QSAR model achieved high prediction performance for toxicity information by identifying key molecular descriptors highly correlated with toxicity indices. Therefore, the proposed QSAR model based on the data-centric XAI approach can be extended to predict the toxicity of potential pollutants in emerging printing chemicals, chemical process, semiconductor or display process."

The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety conducts on-site inspections of foreign food facilities before customs clearance as well as import inspection at the customs clearance stage. However, a data-based safety management plan for imported food is needed due to time, cost, and limited resources.In this study, we tried to increase the efficiency of the on-site inspection by preparing a machine learning prediction model that pre-selects the companies that are expected to fail before the on-site inspection. Basic information of 303,272 foreign food facilities and processing businesses collected in the Integrated Food Safety Information Network and 1,689 cases of on-site inspection information data collected from 2019 to April 2022 were collected. After preprocessing the data of foreign food facilities, only the data subject to on-site inspection were extracted using the foreign food facility_code. As a result, it consisted of a total of 1,689 data and 103 variables. For 103 variables, variables that were ‘0’ were removed based on the Theil-U index, and after reducing by applying Multiple Correspondence Analysis, 49 characteristic variables were finally derived. We build eight different models and perform hyperparameter tuning through 5-fold cross validation. Then, the performance of the generated models are evaluated. The research purpose of selecting companies subject to on-site inspection is to maximize the recall, which is the probability of judging nonconforming companies as nonconforming. As a result of applying various algorithms of machine learning, the Random Forest model with the highest Recall_macro, AUROC, Average PR, F1-score, and Balanced Accuracy was evaluated as the best model. Finally, we apply Kernal SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to present the selection reason for nonconforming facilities of individual instances, and discuss applicability to the on-site inspection facility selection system. Based on the results of this study, it is expected that it will contribute to the efficient operation of limited resources such as manpower and budget by establishing an imported food management system through a data-based scientific risk management model."
Towards automatic EEG cyclic alternating pattern analysis: a systematic review analysis: a systematic review,2023,"['A phase', 'Automatic classification', 'CAP', 'EEG']",,"This study conducted a systematic review to determine the feasibility of automatic Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP)analysis. Specifically, this review followed the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines to address the formulated research question: is automatic CAP analysis viable for clinical application?From the identified 1,280 articles, the review included 35 studies that proposed various methods for examining CAP,including the classification of A phase, their subtypes, or the CAP cycles. Three main trends were observed over timeregarding A phase classification, starting with mathematical models or features classified with a tuned threshold, followedby using conventional machine learning models and, recently, deep learning models. Regarding the CAP cycle detection,it was observed that most studies employed a finite state machine to implement the CAP scoring rules, which depended onan initial A phase classifier, stressing the importance of developing suitable A phase detection models. The assessment ofA-phase subtypes has proven challenging due to various approaches used in the state-of-the-art for their detection, rangingfrom multiclass models to creating a model for each subtype. The review provided a positive answer to the main researchquestion, concluding that automatic CAP analysis can be reliably performed. The main recommended research agendainvolves validating the proposed methodologies on larger datasets, including more subjects with sleep-related disorders,and providing the source code for independent confirmation."

TENSOR는 웹에서 계속 증가하는 테러범죄 관련 데이터를 이해, 획득, 추출 및 분석하는 데 필요한 반복적이고 수동적인 작업 대부분을 대체하여 조사자의 능력을 확장하는 것을 목표로 하는 다크웹에서의자동화된 범죄정보 수집, 추출, 분석, 시각화 플랫폼이다. 쉽게 말해 온라인(표면웹과 다크웹 포함)에서 활동하는 테러범죄자의 정보에 효율적으로 탐지·수집하기 위해 자동화된 대규모 웹 크롤링, 스크래핑, 머신러닝, 자동 봇(bot), 텍스트 및 멀티미디어 마이닝 기술을 활용하는 프로그램 군으로 볼 수 있다.드디어 우리는 AI등이 범죄정보를 자동으로 수집·분석해서 범죄와의 투쟁에 활용할 수 있는 길이 열린 것이다. 이러한 플랫폼이 인간의 범죄정보를 자동으로 수집하는 것은 우선적으로 현행법상 근거규정이 없다는 문제점이 있다. 당연히 우리나라에 도입되지 않은 기술이기 때문에 근거규정이 없다는 한계점은 이해할 수 있지만, 향후 이러한 플랫폼의 도입을 고려하여 사전에 근거규정을 어느 법에, 어느 정도로 설정할 것인가에 대한 고민이 필요한 시점이다.","About 10 years have passed since the existence and dangers of the dark web began to become known to the public in Korea. The dark web, which was an unfamiliar concept, has now become an area that many people are aware of due to several serious crimes and media reports about them. In Korea, the drug problem mainly on the dark web is treated as the most serious issue. On January 26, 2023, the Ministry of Justice announced that it would establish a dedicated dark web investigation team to prevent drug crimes and restore the status of the Drug Cleansing Agency through the '2023 Ministry of Justice's Five Core Promotion Tasks', and in fact, in the prosecution personnel appointment in February 2023, It was reported that the Seoul Central, Incheon, Busan, and Gwangju District Prosecutors' Offices have established special drug crime investigation teams and strengthened the dark web investigation team with about 20 members. This is due to the so-called going dark phenomenon of crime, in which criminals who are reluctant to be exposed commit various types of crimes in dark, hidden areas of the Internet or in encrypted private channels with few ways to access them in real time. In other words, the crime phenomenon on the dark web, where no traces of crime are left behind by general methods, is becoming more serious, and this means that our investigative agencies must undergo changes that are different from the fight against crime in the past.However, the rapid development of artificial intelligence and machine learning has brought about great progress in criminal investigation on the dark web, and a project called TENSOR conducted by the EU's ‘HORIZON 2020 Research and Innovation Program’ is worth noting. TENSOR is an automated crime intelligence collection on the dark web that aims to expand the capabilities of investigators by replacing much of the repetitive, manual work needed to understand, acquire, extract and analyze the ever-growing amount of terrorism-related data on the web, an extraction, analysis, and visualization platform. Simply put, automated large-scale web crawling, scraping, machine learning, automatic bots, and text and multimedia mining technologies are utilized to efficiently detect and collect information on terrorist criminals active online (including the surface web and dark web). It can be seen as a group of programs that do.Finally, we have opened the way for AI and other systems to automatically collect and analyze crime information and use it to fight crime. The problem with these platforms automatically collecting human crime information is that there are no basis regulations under the current law. Of course, since it is a technology that has not been introduced in Korea, the limitation of the lack of basis regulations is understandable, but considering the introduction of such platforms in the future, it is necessary to consider in advance which law and to what extent the basis regulations will be established."

The yellowish pigmentation is the gesture of an increase in bilirubin levels. It is common in 2/3 of all active infants. It is a condition caused by the problems of poor breastfeeding, the lifespan of red blood cells, or the hydration level. Every year, about 1.1 million infants are affected by hyperbilirubinemia. The approach and knowledge of the purpose of neonatal jaundice are restricted. Exploring the purpose of neonatal jaundice has superior significance in reducing jaundice-related infant mortality and morbidity. According to pudmed.com, case-control analysis is carried out and produces a medical chart of 272 infants for public healthcare units. Proper diagnosis of the disease is required to reduce the mortality rate. Computer vision techniques are essential to diagnose the disease. It can be done with the appropriate machine learning techniques. The existing system uses machine learning methodology to analyze the presence of disease. The severity level of the disease is determined by using a bilirubin meter. It may lead to poor performance due to a lack of severity level identification. Fifth, AdaBoost-Random Forest is carried out to identify the presence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Sixth, the CNN model was trained along with color-card techniques to identify their severity level. Finally, the time series property is included to perform continuous monitoring of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The performance evaluation of the model provides class 1 and class 2 specificity of 0.98 and 0.98, the accuracy of the 0.98 and 0.98, MCC of 0.97 and 0.96, and f-measure of 0.98 and 0.98 respectively.

In the propulsion mechanism, vibratory torque from the engine gives repetitive twist which is referred as torsional vibration in such shaft system that results in fatigue damage of the shaft. In order to prevent lethal shaft damage, torsional vibration of propulsion shaft system has been analyzed by solving differential equations. Traditionally, the process of selecting anti-vibration countermeasures is determined and optimized by iterative analysis process with human judgment. In the study a sample set of data was utilized to find regression equations for the torsional vibration aspect – natural frequency and peak torsional response. Multivariate Polynomial Regression (MPR) as one of the machine learning methods is considered the most probable as it enables to provide regression equation with high order and interactions between variables. This approach with the machine learning is able to provide an assistance for an optimized countermeasure in the early shaft design stage."

This pilot, open-label study aims at characterizing probiotic fecal detection parameters (onset, persistence, and duration) and their relationship with whole gut transit time (WGTT). Correlations with fecal microbiota composition are also explored.MethodsThirty healthy adults (30.4 ± 13.3 years) received a probiotic (30 × 109 CFU/capsule/day, 2 weeks; containing Lactobacillus helveticus R0052, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei HA-108, Bifidobacterium breve HA-129, Bifidobacterium longum R0175, and Streptococcus thermophilus HA-110). Probiotic intake was flanked by 4-week washout periods, with 18 stool collections throughout the study. WGTT was measured using 80% recovery of radio-opaque markers.ResultsTested strains were detected in feces ~1-2 days after first intake and persistence after intake cessation was not significantly different for R0052, HA-108, and HA-129 (~3-6 days). We identified 3 WGTT subgroups within this population (named Fast, Intermediate, and Slow), which could be classified by machine learning with high accuracy based on differentially abundant taxa. On average, R0175 persisted significantly longer in the intermediate WGTT subgroup (~8.5 days), which was mainly due to 6 of the 13 Intermediate participants for whom R0175 persisted ≥ 15 days. Machine learning classified these 13 participants according to their WGTT cluster (≥ 15 days or < 5 days) with high accuracy, highlighting differentially abundant taxa potentially associated with R0175 persistence.ConclusionThese results support the notion that host-specific parameters such as WGTT and microbiota composition should be considered when designing studies involving probiotics, especially for the optimization of washout duration in crossover studies but also for the definition of enrollment criteria or supplementation regimen in specific populations."

Extensive efforts have been made to mitigate accidents and develop effective prevention strategies. This research paper focuses on a comprehensive analysis of traffic accidents in Seoul, aiming to identify factors and accident types that contribute to increased severity. To achieve this, we introduced a new approach called “TrafficNet: A Hybrid CNN-FNN Model” to evaluate effects of various parameters on the severity of traffic accidents in Seoul. Our main objective was to classify accidents into four distinct levels of severity: minor injuries, slander, fatalities, and injury reports. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments using publicly available traffic accident data provided by Seoul Metropolitan Government. These experiments involved six different models, including five machine learning models (decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, gradient boosting, and support vector machine) and one deep learning model (multilayer perceptron). The proposed model demonstrated exceptional performance, surpassing all other models and previous research findings using the same dataset.

The goal is to identify potential vehicle defects based on the findings of our algorithm, which can assist automakers in mitigating significant losses and reputational damage caused by mass claims. To achieve this goal, our model uses the Word2Vec method to analyze large volumes of unstructured customer complaint data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). By developing a score dictionary for eight pre-selected criteria, our algorithm can efficiently categorize complaints and detect potential vehicle defects. By calculating the score of each complaint, our algorithm can identify patterns and correlations that can indicate potential defects in the vehicle. One of the key benefits of this approach is its ability to handle a large volume of unstructured data, which can be challenging for traditional methods. By using machine learning techniques, we can extract meaningful insights from customer complaints, which can help automakers prioritize and address potential defects before they become widespread issues. In conclusion, this research provides a promising approach to categorize unstructured customer complaints in the automotive industry and identify potential vehicle defects. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we can help automakers improve the quality of their products and enhance customer satisfaction. Further studies can build upon this approach to explore other potential applications and expand its scope to other industries."

Among these causes of defects, it is intended to prevent defects due to omission of the metal bush by using signals from sensors attached to the facility. In particular, a metal bush omission is predicted through various data mining techniques using left load cell value, right load cell value, current, and voltage as independent variables. In the case of metal bush omission defect, it is difficult to get defect data, resulting in data imbalance. Data imbalance refers to a case where there is a large difference in the number of data belonging to each class, which can be a problem when performing classification prediction. In order to solve the problem caused by data imbalance, oversampling and composite sampling techniques were applied in this study.

In this study, in order to eliminate these limitations and develop moreenvironmentally friendly dyeing processes, the dyeability of polyester under different conditions with reactive, direct, andacid dyes after surface modifications with enzyme and chitosan was investigated. In addition to the corresponding physicalexperiments, CIELAB and color strength values were also estimated using random forests. The results of the physical experimentsshowed that the surface modifications conducted with enzyme and chitosan significantly increased the color depthsobtained in dyeing for reactive, direct, and acid dyes, especially at pH 4.5. This was explained by the potentially protonatedamine groups in acidic medium of chitosan could have attracted large amounts of anionic dye molecules with physical forces.The highest color depths were obtained from acid dyeing. Washing fastness of the pre-treated and dyed fabrics (except theacid-dyed fabrics) decreased with the shift of the bath pH values to the acidic region. In the next phase of the study, weimplemented random forests to estimate CIELAB and color strength values. We considered different random forest designsand trained each design ten times to observe the performance of the corresponding topology. The results of the computationalexperiments showed that the estimation performance of the random forests is quite satisfactory (with R-values greater than99%) and random forests could be used to estimate CIELAB and color strength values successfully."

In order to solve these difficulties, we proposed a method to improve the efficiency of processing by using less memory and checked the performance of the proposed model. The technique applied in this paper to evaluate the performance of the proposed model is to divide the large corpus by adjusting the number of attention heads and embedding size of the BERT[1] model to be small, and the results are calculated by averaging the output values of each forward. In this process, a random offset was assigned to the sentences at every epoch to provide diversity in the input data. The model was then fine-tuned for classification. We found that the split processing model was about 12% less accurate than the unsplit model, but the number of parameters in the model was reduced by 56%."

However, the reservoir faces several issues that jeopardize its efficient operation and management. To address this issues, we propose a novel deep-learning-based water level recognition model that uses CCTV image data to accurately estimate water levels in agricultural reservoirs. The model consists of three main parts: (1) dataset construction, (2) image segmentation using the U-Net algorithm, and (3) CCTV-based water level recognition using either CNN or ResNet. The model has been applied to two reservoirs G-reservoir and M-reservoir with observed CCTV image and water level time series data. The results show that the performance of the image segmentation model is superior, while the performance of the water level recognition model varies from 50 to 80% depending on water level classification criteria (i.e., classification guideline) and complexity of image data (i.e., variability of the image pixels). The performance of the model can be improved if more numbers of data can be collected."

Reynolds stress correction by data assimilation methods with physical constraints,2023,"['machine learning', 'non-linear closure', 'RANS', 'realizability conditions', 'turbulence modeling']",,"Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are extensively employed in industrial settings for the purpose of simulating intricate fluid flows. However, these models are subject to certain limitations. Notably, disparities persist in the Reynolds stresses when comparing the RANS model with high-fidelity data obtained from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) or experimental measurements. In this work we propose an approach to mitigate these discrepancies while retaining the favorable attributes of the Menter Shear Stress Transport (SST) model, such as its significantly lower computational expense compared to DNS simulations. This strategy entails incorporating an explicit algebraic model and employing a neural network to correct the turbulent characteristic time. The imposition of realizability constraints is investigated through the introduction of penalization terms. The assimilated Reynolds stress model demonstrates good predictive performance in both in-sample and out-of-sample flow configurations. This suggests that the model can effectively capture the turbulent characteristics of the flow and produce physically realistic predictions."
A Case Study on Integrating Google Translate into College EFL Writing Instruction,2023,"['machine translation', 'Google Translate', 'post-editing skills', 'Korean college students', 'EFL writing instruction']",,"This case study focused on integrating Google Translate (GT) and post-editing skills into English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing instruction for Korean college students. Over a four-day writing class, twelve students completed four drafts, and the use of GT output, along with paraphrasing and error correction skills, was examined in detail. Surveys and interviews were utilized to gather student feedback. The findings revealed that initially, the students heavily relied on the output of GT. However, as they learned post-editing skills, they began independently changing expressions and correcting errors. In Draft 3, 54 out of 58 expressions were paraphrased, and 67 out of 80 errors were corrected based on the GT output. Yet, with the employment of post-editing skills in Draft 4, there was a noticeable decrease in reliance on the GT output, with students making more efforts to paraphrase and correct errors independently. They also expressed high satisfaction with the effectiveness of paraphrasing for writing. Nevertheless, they still faced challenges in grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure, highlighting the need for teacher involvement in writing classrooms. The study concluded by addressing the implications, limitations, and providing suggestions for future research."

In this new method, a laboratory data were used to obtain fault diagnosis models for wind turbine bearings. The first step was evaluating the interdomain distribution difference and intraclass distribution differences between domains. The second step was setting a dynamic adversarial factor to dynamically measure the relative contribution of the two different distributions. The last step was, reducing the distribution difference through multiple adversarial training, to obtain the diagnosis results.

In advanced nations, the damage was even greater due to high medical and examination costs because they did not go to the hospital. Therefore, from a software engineering-based perspective, we propose a learning model for determining coronavirus infection through symptom data-based software prediction models and tools. After a comparative analysis of various models (decision tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, multi-perceptron neural network), we decide to choose an appropriate decision tree model. Due to a lack of data, additional survey data and overseas symptom data are applied and built into the judgment model. To protect from thiswe also adapt human normalization approach with traditional Korean medicin approach.

An LSTM model with optimal feature selection for predictions of tensile behavior and tensile failure of polymer matrix composites,2023,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical Property', 'Polymer Matrix Composites']",,"Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, ductility, and tensile modulus are essential criteria in polymer matrix composites (PMC) design and are determined through the stress-strain curve obtained from the tensile test. Material designers can examine the stress-strain curve trends based on the combination and composition, but it is difficult to predict using numerical analysis software due to the complex correlation based on chemical properties. To address these limitations in PMC design, this study uses feature engineering methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and recursive feature elimination with cross validation (RFECV) to find the minimal and optimal set of features necessary for predicting the tensile behavior of PMC. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and feedforward neural network (FNN) models are trained using the optimal feature set and 1,270 PMC’s tensile test data to predict the tensile stress-strain curve. The predictive model developed in this study provides stress-strain curves of tensile tests, including tensile failure of PMC, which can be challenging due to the high nonlinearity of PMC. Material designers can reduce the time and labor costs of PMC design through this tensile behavior prediction model that has an accuracy of R2=92% and requires fewer features. In addition, the model can be used as a high-throughput screening model for PMC inverse design systems."

SVMs are  widely used in classification problems because they can be applied in various problems and deal  with high dimensional data effectively. However, in the presense of many noise variables, the prediction accuracy of a SVM can degrade and the interpretation of the final model is difficult. To remedy these disadvantages, a variable selection method based on the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) penalty can be considered. The elastic net penalty has been proposed in regression to overcome the shortcoming of the LASSO that the LASSO tends to select only one variable among the correlated variables when varaibles are strongly correlated. In this article, we consider a variable selection method in nonlinear classifications adopting the COSSO (component selection and smoothing operator), called the COSSO-SVM. The EL-COSSO-SVM adopting the elastic net instead of the LASSO is introduced. Our method is illustrated to improve the performances both in variable selection and prediction of the COSSO-SVM through simulation studies and real data analyses."

In this study, artificial intelligence was used to predict the type of the shock wave from the shape of the airfoil. To this end, a total of 500 airfoils were generated by changing eight variables using the Class/Shape-function Transformation(CST) parametrization method, and flow was solved using KFLOW. Using the analysis results, Multi-Layer Perceptron(MLP) was trained to predict the type of the shock wave from the airfoil geometry. Using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence(XAI) techniques Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation(LIME), SHapley Additive exPlanation(SHAP), and Explainable Boosting Machine(EBM), the prediction results of the model were presented in an interpretable form. The analysis results obtained by applying LIME and SHAP to the MLP model were compared with the analysis results of EBM.. As a result of global and local explanation, it was confirmed that the influence of the variable in charge of the upper middle of the airfoil was the greatest on shock wave prediction."
An improved YOLOX approach for low-light and small object detection: PPE on tunnel construction sites,2023,"['computer vision', 'machine learning', 'deep learning', 'tunnel management', 'construction safety']",,"Tunnel construction sites pose a significant safety risk to workers due to the low-light conditions that can affect visibility and lead to accidents. Therefore, identifying personal protective equipment (PPE) is critical to prevent injuries and fatalities. A few researches have addressed the challenges posed by tunnel construction sites whose light conditions are lower and images are captured from a distance. In this study, we proposed an improved YOLOX approach and a new dataset for detecting low-light and small PPE. We modified the YOLOX architecture by adding ConvNeXt modules to the backbone for deep feature extraction and introducing the fourth YOLOX head for enhancing multiscale prediction. Additionally, we adopted the CLAHE algorithm for augmenting low-light images after comparing it with eight other methods. Consequently, the improved YOLOX approach achieves a mean average precision of 86.94%, which is 4.23% higher than the original model and outperforms selected state-of-the-art. It also improves the average precision of small object classes by 7.17% on average and attains a real-time processing speed of 22 FPS (Frames Per Second). Furthermore, we constructed a novel dataset with 8285 low-light instances and 6814 small ones. The improved YOLOX approach offers accurate and efficient detection performance, which can reduce safety incidents on tunnel construction sites."

Traditional recommender systems use Factorization Machines for rating predictions and each feature is selected with the same weight. Thus, there are problems with inaccurate ratings and limited data representation. This study proposes a deep recommendation model based on self-attention Factorization (SAFMR) to solve these problems. Thismodel uses Convolutional Neural Networks to extract features from user and item reviews. The obtained features are fed into self-attention mechanism Factorization Machines, where the self-attention network automatically learns the dependencies of the features and distinguishes the weights of the different features, thereby reducing the prediction error. The model was experimentally evaluated using six classes of dataset. We compared MSE, NDCG and time for several real datasets.

As a result of the performance evaluation, when variables measured by CFFA were included, high scores of over 0.8 was shown in all evaluation indicators. In comparison, when variables measured by CFFA were excluded, performance deteriorated in all indicators. The difference in performance was greatest in recall. Therefore, it was confirmed that the variables measured by CFFA can be applied as explanatory variables in predicting insolvency and strengthen the ability to identify distressed companies. Based on these findings, this study is expected to contribute to enabling firms and creditor institutions to proactively respond to insolvency management."

There is a deviation in theMRT between the indoor core and perimeter zones depending on a building’s thermal properties; this deviation must be mitigated to ensurethermal comfort. However, there are various practical limitations involved in directly measuring the MRT of these zones. Therefore, this studydeveloped a model that virtually sensed the MRT of the core and perimeter zones using the random forest. To verify the model’sperformance, the experiment was conducted during the summer season when the MRT deviation between these zones are often the largest. Asa result, the proposed model showed an MRT inference performance of 0.0568°C in the core zone and 0.123°C in the perimeter zone, basedon the mean absolute error. This study demonstrated the potential of the MRT virtual sensor for evaluating the inference performance of thecore and perimeter zones. The virtual sensor can be used in HVAC control systems to improve an occupant’s thermal comfort."

This study investigated the efficacy of a hybrid model that adopted a meta-heuristic algorithm (MHA) as an optimizer to extend the training ANN method, from a gradient-based to a stochastic population-based approach for streamflow forecasting. In the latter, parameter tuning utilizing the design of experiment (DOE) technique, has become an integral element in the optimization process due to reliance on their parameters. For model convenience, a wavelet transform was employed to decompose the series into sub-series. The empirical studies of MHA performance showed that the hybrid MHA-ANN was superior for streamflow forecasting, especially with the firefly algorithm that had an average RMSE = 96.06, an improvement of approximately 17% over the gradient-based ANN (RMSE = 113.92). However, among the adopted MHAs, not all are compatible with optimizing the ANN for streamflow forecasting, thus requiring a thorough study as performance varies from case to case. Two additional statistical tests, such as the Kruskal-Wallis H test and the Mann-Whitney U test, further validated such disparity in the MHA's performance."

The developed analytical tool showed higher accuracy than the conventional methods and could be used under diverse experimental conditions of image staining intensity, brightness, and contrast.Our automated cell detection algorithm is available for free and has an intelligible graphical user interface for cell counting to assist practical applications. Overall, we expect that the proposed TH+ cell counting tool will promote preclinical PD research by saving time and enabling objective analysis of IHC images."

However, this phenomenon is mainly caused by the increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to human activities. Additionally, it is causing climate change and causing various environmental and social problems around the world. To solve this, we are setting a carbon neutrality goal and establishing various response strategies, such as increasing the use of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, a study was conducted to analyze and predict temperature changes due to global warming. For this purpose, the increase was determined by comparing and contrasting the average air temperature in the 1960s with the recent average air temperature. Based on this, a model was designed to analyze and predict the degree of average air temperature increase over time based on the increase. Data distributed by NASA-GISS (National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies) was used. Additionally, regression analysis was applied to perform analysis and prediction. As a result of the simulation, the average air temperature was found to be rising by 0.3 degrees every 10 years. In particular, China and India, which have large populations, showed a higher average air temperature increase than other countries."

Traditional signal processing methods have the inconvenience of having to analyze the data characteristics of the domain and extract valid features manually every time the domain changes in order to diagnose a specific machine failure. In contrast, the methods using deep learning automatically extract valid features regardless of the domain, but they face the challenge of securing a large amount of data to train a deep neural network. In this study, we extract universal features widely used in traditional signal processing methods and apply the Relief-F algorithm to automatically select valid features. Finally input them into a shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier, which can be trained with relatively little training data, to detect and diagnose machine failures regardless of the domain. As a result of applying the proposed method to the MaFaulDa dataset, it showed an accuracy of 99.95% for both fault detection and diagnosis when using a 256-dimensional feature vector. Even when the feature vector was reduced to 64 dimensions, the fault detection and diagnosis accuracy were 99.75% and 99.65%, respectively.

Model performance evaluation was investigated by using the F1 score together with the coefficient of determination (R2 score), which is mainly used in regression models. The coefficient of determination can be used as a performance indicator, since it shows the predicted results of the saturation magnetic flux density of full material datasets in a balanced way. However, the BMG alloy contains iron and requires a high saturation magnetic flux density to have excellent applicability as a soft magnetic material, and in this study F1 score was used as a performance indicator to better predict Bs above the threshold value of Bs (1.4 T). After obtaining two ANN models optimized for the R2 and F1 score conditions, respectively, their prediction performance was compared for the test data. As a case study to evaluate the prediction performance, new Fe-based BMG datasets that were not included in the training and test datasets were predicted using the two ANN models. The results showed that the model with an excellent F1 score achieved a more accurate prediction for a material with a high saturation magnetic flux density."

Even if the suitability of respiratory protection has been confirmed through testing in a laboratory environment, there remains the potential for leakage points in the respirators due to improper application by the wearer, damage to the equipment, or sudden movements in real working conditions. In this paper, we propose a method to detect the occurrence of leak holes by measuring the pressure changes inside the mask according to the wearer's breathing activity by attaching an IoT sensor to a full-face respirator. We designed 9 experimental scenarios by adjusting the degree of leak holes of the respirator and the breathing cycle time, and acquired respiratory data for the wearer of the respirator accordingly. Additionally, we analyzed the respiratory data to identify the duration and pressure change range for each breath, utilizing this data to train a neural network model for detecting leak holes in the respirator. The experimental results applying the developed neural network model showed a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 94.29%, and accuracy of 97.53%.

In order to solve this problem, the supply of new and renewable energy is being activated, and the new and renewable energy market is also expanding. In particular, the share of solar and wind energy among new and renewable energies is rapidly increasing. However, uncertainty and volatility are inherent in renewable energy due to the characteristics of power generation that depend on natural conditions. This leads to a problem in which errors occur in the prediction of the amount of reserve energy required to secure the amount and cost of renewable energy generation. In this paper, we propose an ensemble-based solar power generation prediction system applying missing value interpolation algorithm. It predicts the amount of solar power generation by using weather forecast data from the Korea Meteorological Administration, and provides visualization and scheduling functions for the amount of power generation and predicted amount through a web page."

However, compared to conventional ships, research on small fishing boats is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a model that estimates the motion response essential for calculating the motion performance of small fishing boats using a deep neural network. Hydrodynamic analysis was conducted on 15 small fishing boats, and a database was established. Environmental conditions and main particulars were applied as input data, and the response amplitude operators were utilized as the output data. The motion response predicted by the trained deep neural network model showed similar trends to the hydrodynamic analysis results. The results showed that the high-frequency motion responses were predicted well with a low error.

The former is mixed with bubble noise, flow noise, and fluid-induced interaction noise measured in a pipe and can be classified into three types. The latter is the noise generated when an underwater projectile is ejected from a launch tube and has a characteristic of instantaenous noise. For such types of noise, a data-driven model can be more useful than an analytical model. We constructed an LSTM model with given data and evaluated the model’s performance based on the number of hidden units, the number of input sequences, and the decimation factor of signal. It is shown that the optimal LSTM model works well for new data of the same type."

However, a well-structured market system is yet to be established. We surveyed 4 60 women with sewing as a hobby who had purchased these DIY clothing pattern packages. The survey revealed that majority of respondents had their hobby for over five years. Choosing the right fabric to match clothing patterns presented a common challenge. Most participants owned a sewing machine and an overlocker, with price being the primary concern when purchasing a package. For guidance during the sewing process, participants preferred print materials featuring real-life images. Those with less sewing experience leaned towards video tutorials. Items of interest or those commonly created included blouses, shirts, and dresses. Desire for further learning in sewing and pattern-making was prominent, with a clear preference for online classes. Several strategies are recommended to enhance the appeal of DIY clothing package products, including broadening range of packages that incorporate fabric, offering supplementary educational resources to improve users' skills, implementing affordable pricing structures, supplying comprehensive creation guidelines, and making available design modification guides. These considerations could significantly boost customer satisfaction. This research intends to lay groundwork for understanding DIY clothing creation market, ultimately fostering production of highly desirable products. Insights of this study will prove instrumental in refining product development and devising effective marketing tactics, leading to a more rewarding consumer experience."
The Role of AI Translators on Reading Comprehension,2023,"['AI translator', 'reading', 'perception', 'artificial intelligence', 'machine translator']",,"This study aims to investigate reading comprehension and students’ perception in a university reading course using an AI translator, whether Google or Papago Translate.

Reading comprehension tests and a post-questionnaire were then administered to examine the effects of using AI translators. The findings showed that all three groups significantly improved their reading comprehension scores in the post-tests as compared to those in the pre-tests. However, there were no statistically significant differences between groups. Regarding students’ perception, the participants using an AI translator showed no statistical differences between the two experimental groups. However, in terms of sentence structure, students’ translations after using an AI translator were perceived to be of significantly higher quality compared with those that simply used the translator. Most participants stated that using AI translators was much more beneficial to get the main idea and for understanding the whole passage, rather than using it simply to learn vocabulary and expressions. Furthermore, using AI translators relieved the participants’ anxiety and burden while also satisfying them. However, such students also had lower mean scores in terms of interest and motivation for language learning in the post-questionnaire items.

Translation Method to Acquire the Idiomatic Expressions of the Passive Voice,2023,"['기계번역', '수동태', '관용적표현', '번역식 방법', 'Machine Translation', 'Passive Voice', 'Idiomatic Expressions', 'Translation Method']",,"Translation method has been applied to English as Foreign Language (EFL) learners for various practices, including extended writing, learning grammar structures, and also for checking self-study assignments. Previous studies showed that translation-method-based exercises were effective for acquiring passive voice and for extended compositions requiring passive voice structures. Then the question arose for passive voice with the idiomatic use of the prepositions other than ‘by’. Students were often confused with the different prepositions used in such idiomatic expressions and ended up just simply memorizing. Thus, this paper aims to find out whether the translation method could be effective for acquiring the idiomatic use of the preposition other than ‘by’. Self-study using the translated method was examined with participant survey with opinions on the translation method. Out of the valid answers, more than 80% of the participants preferred the new translation method. Their answers note that the new method was able to expose them to new words or expressions that they will usually not use for their composition. With the students’ opinion and positive feedback on the translation method, further practice and tasks should be given to the students for further examination."

To improve the efficiency of the drug discovery, artificial intelligence has been actively applied in the field. Aptamers, one of next-generation biomaterials in the drug discovery, attracts a lot of attention in recent decades. Aptamers are single-strand oligonucleotides that comprise tertiary structures and bind to specific target proteins. Aptamers are considered safer and more stable than traditional biomaterials. Therefore, Aptamers are used in various new drug development fields, such as laboratory tests for infectious diseases and cancer treatments. However, SELEX, a representative experiment for aptamer discovery, face at challenges since it takes a lot of time to determine aptamer sequences that bind to a given target protein. In this study, we developed a computer-based method to reduce the cost for aptamer discovery. And we also developed a transformer-based aptamer-protein interaction prediction classification model for discovering aptamer candidate sequences, and propose a system for generating aptamer candidate sequences using genetic algorithms. Nucleotide sequences could be generated using the designed system, and a molecular structure docking simulation called ZDOCK was used to measure the quality of the generated candidate sequences. As a result, generated sequences were confirmed that the docking score was similar or higher than that of the actual aptamers."

A Classifying Model of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Based on Heart Rate Variability in a Large Korean Population,2023,"['Sleep Apnea', 'Obstructive', 'Heart Rate', 'Polysomnography', 'Machine Learning']",,"Background: The majority of patients with obstructive sleep apnea do not receive timely diagnosis and treatment because of the complexity of a diagnostic test. We aimed to predict obstructive sleep apnea based on heart rate variability, body mass index, and demographic characteristics in a large Korean population.Methods: Models of binary classification for predicting obstructive sleep apnea severity were constructed using 14 features including 11 heart rate variability variables, age, sex, and body mass index. Binary classification was conducted separately using apnea-hypopnea index thresholds of 5, 15, and 30. Sixty percent of the participants were randomly allocated to training and validation sets while the other forty percent were designated as the test set.Classifying models were developed and validated with 10-fold cross-validation using logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron algorithms.Results: A total of 792 (651 men and 141 women) subjects were included. The mean age, body mass index, and apnea-hypopnea index score were 55.1 years, 25.9 kg/m2 , and 22.9, respectively. The sensitivity of the best performing algorithm was 73.6%, 70.7%, and 78.4% when the apnea-hypopnea index threshold criterion was 5, 10, and 15, respectively. The prediction performances of the best classifiers at apnea-hypopnea indices of 5, 15, and 30 were as follows: accuracy, 72.2%, 70.0%, and 70.3%; specificity, 64.6%, 69.2%, and 67.9%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 77.2%, 73.5%, and 80.1%, respectively.Overall, the logistic regression model using the apnea-hypopnea index criterion of 30 showed the best classifying performance among all models.Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea was fairly predicted by using heart rate variability, body mass index, and demographic characteristics in a large Korean population. Prescreening and continuous treatment monitoring of obstructive sleep apnea may be possible simply by measuring heart rate variability."

Gradually recognized as “Customer logistics,” the last-mile market is now considered an essential part of the urban service, leading to the recent implementation of the Last-mile Logistics Service Act. Despite the increasing interest and significance, there are not much thorough researches and studies yet done in this customer logistics field. This research aims to address this gap by designing a predictive model based on real parcel delivery data. By comparing and analyzing the model against actual data, the study classifies 229 administrative regions (municipalities) in Korea into four distinct types. Through this approach, the research provides a framework for analyzing under-served areas in the customer logistics that takes into account various social factors (economy, population, etc.), beyond the traditional papers which focused on geographical factors such as remote areas. The analysis of the predictive model reveals that around 50% of metropolitan cities exhibit lower levels of customer logistics compared to the predicted quantities. Even in highly developed cities like Seoul, there is a likeliness of being an under-served area in approximately 20% of 25 districts. Furthermore, 77% of regions, previously classified as delivery service vulnerable areas (rural areas), are identified as under-served areas. Additionally, it is observed that the actual volume of deliveries in remote areas, particularly in rural and mountainous regions, is insufficient. Thus, resolving the unequal distribution of logistics services between regions requires a comprehensive consideration of multiple factors."

In particular, in experiments using Amazon Magazine data, F1 and AUC values were improved by 11.7% and 21.9%, respectively, showing a significant performance improvement effect. The performance of CausRec is improved because both positive and negative perceptions of the item were reflected in the recommendation at the same time. It is judged that the proposed method was able to improve the performance of the collaborative filtering because it can simultaneously alleviate the sparsity and imbalance problems of the interaction data."
Named Entity Recognition in Electronic Health Records: A Methodological Review,2023,"['Clinical Decision Support System', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Deep Learning', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Supervised Machine Learning']",,"Objectives: A substantial portion of the data contained in Electronic Health Records (EHR) is unstructured, often appearingas free text. This format restricts its potential utility in clinical decision-making. Named entity recognition (NER) methodsaddress the challenge of extracting pertinent information from unstructured text. The aim of this study was to outline thecurrent NER methods and trace their evolution from 2011 to 2022. Methods: We conducted a methodological literature reviewof NER methods, with a focus on distinguishing the classification models, the types of tagging systems, and the languagesemployed in various corpora. Results: Several methods have been documented for automatically extracting relevant informationfrom EHRs using natural language processing techniques such as NER and relation extraction (RE). These methodscan automatically extract concepts, events, attributes, and other data, as well as the relationships between them. Most NERstudies conducted thus far have utilized corpora in English or Chinese. Additionally, the bidirectional encoder representationfrom transformers using the BIO tagging system architecture is the most frequently reported classification scheme. Wediscovered a limited number of papers on the implementation of NER or RE tasks in EHRs within a specific clinical domain.Conclusions: EHRs play a pivotal role in gathering clinical information and could serve as the primary source for automatedclinical decision support systems. However, the creation of new corpora from EHRs in specific clinical domains is essential tofacilitate the swift development of NER and RE models applied to EHRs for use in clinical practice."

In particular,in the semiconductor manufacturing processes, productivity and efficiency of themanufacturing process are improved by predicting defects in advance using dataanalysis. However, missing data occurs owing to failures and discharges of sensorsand equipment. When missing values are ignored, the reliability of the analysis islowed because the sample size of the data is reduced, and when missing values areestimated using machine learning and statistical techniques, the accuracy ofanalysis performance is lowered because the uncertainty of missing values is notconsidered. Therefore, this study proposes a framework that improves the accuracyof predicting defects by reflecting the drift of data attributes and considering theuncertainty of missing values through a stochastic process based on quantummechanics. Semiconductor manufacturing data with missing values are classified aspass or fail through Deep Neural Network (DNN). In order to prove the superiorityof the proposed framework, the defect prediction using the proposed framework isperformed and compared with the existing algorithms."

With the recent development of the metaverse, the traditional way of experiencing services is changing. While existing studies have mainly focused on the technological advancements of metaverse services (e.g., scope of technological enablers, application areas of technologies), recent studies are focusing on evaluating the quality of experience (QoE) of metaverse services from a customer perspective. This is because understanding and analyzing service characteristics that determine QoE from a customer perspective is essential for designing successful metaverse services. However, relatively few studies have explored the customer-oriented approach for QoE evaluation thus far. This study conducted an online review analysis using text mining to overcome this limitation. In particular, this study analyzed 227,332 online reviews of the Roblox service, known as a representative metaverse service, and identified points for improving the Roblox service based on the analysis results. As a result of the study, nine service features that can be used for QoE evaluation of metaverse services were derived, and the importance of each feature was estimated through relationship analysis with service satisfaction.

As a result, it was confirmed that SVM showed relatively higher accuracy than KNN and was more useful in diagnosing the presence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. In future research, it is expected that classification performance can be further improved by adding various indicators that evaluate not only TI but also cardiac function and securing more data. Furthermore, it is expected to be used as basic data to predict and classify other diseases and solve the problem of insufficient medical manpower compared to the increasing number of tests."

Web-based synthetic-aperture radar data management system and land cover classification,2023,"['Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image', 'Land cover classification', 'Machine learning', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Remote sensing']",,"With the advance of radar technologies, the availability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images increases. To improve application of SAR images, a management system for SAR images is proposed in this paper. The system provides trainable land cover classification module and display of SAR images on the map. Users of the system can create their own classifier with their data, and obtain the classified results of newly captured SAR images by applying the classifier to the images. The classifier is based on convolutional neural network structure. Since there are differences among SAR images depending on capturing method and devices, a fixed classifier cannot cover all types of SAR land cover classification problems. Thus, it is adopted to create each user’s classifier. In our experiments, it is shown that the module works well with two different SAR datasets. With this system, SAR data and land cover classification results are managed and easily displayed."
Enhanced dataset synthesis using conditional generative adversarial networks,2023,"['Generative adversarial network', 'Feature extraction', 'Conditional GAN', 'Dataset synthesis', 'Deep learning']",,"Biomedical data acquisition, and reaching sufficient samples of participants are difficult and time ans effort consuming processes. On the other hand, the success rates of computer aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms are sample and feature space depended. In this paper, conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) based enhanced feature generation is proposed to synthesize large sample datasets having higher class separability. Twenty five percent of five medical datasets are used to train CGAN, and the synthetic datasets with any sample size are evaluated and compared to originals. Thus, new datasets can be generated with the help of the CGAN model and lower sample collection. It helps physicians decreasing sample collection processes, and it increases accuracy rates of the CAD systems using generated enhanced data with enhanced feature vectors. The synthesized datasets are classified using nearest neighbor, radial basis function support vector machine and artificial neural network to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed CGAN model."

물리와 데이터 분석 모델을 결합한 해안선 변화 모델링 기법,2023,"['Shoreline Prediction', 'Ordinary Differential Equations', 'Genetic Algorithm', 'Physics Informed Machine Learning']",,"In modern engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and several data analysis techniques are frequently used and developed in various fields. These quantitative approaches, however, are somewhat focused on the assumption that sensor data properly expresses the physical phenomenon. Besides they still have limitations such as nonlinearity, different environmental condition and complexity of response. Another issue is that the data can be obtained through experiments, but due to the constraints of time and cost of experiments, obtaining a large amount of data that may be able to fully explain diverse natural occurrences is impossible. To deal with the aforementioned issues, we propose shoreline prediction techniques using a combination of physics and data analysis models. The physical coefficients of the existing differential equation are optimized through a genetic algorithm and approximate solution is obtained through the Euler method. This was used as prior knowledge and combined with a data analysis model to predict the shoreline position. As a result of the experiment, when there was enough training data, the performance of data analysis model was better than that of the proposed method, but the performance of the proposed method was better in situations where the training data was insufficient."

To solve this problem, a Decision Tree model for CMs preparation (DTC) was established based on the relationship between the process parameters and the yields of CMs. Then, the importance of variables in the preparation process for CMs was predicted, the relationship between experimental conditions and yields was revealed, and the preparation process conditions were also optimized by the DTC. The prediction results showed that the importance of the variables was raw material type, solvothermal temperature, solvothermal time, solvent amount, and additive type in order. And the optimized reaction conditions were as follows: coal tar was pretreated by decompress distillation and centrifugation, the solvent amount was 50.0 ml, the solvothermal temperature was 230 °C, and the reaction time was 5 h. These prediction results were consistent with the actual experimental results, and the error between the predicted yields and the actual yields was about − 1.1%. Furthermore, the prediction error of DTC method was within the acceptable range when the data sample sets were reduced to 100 sets.

Therefore, legal measures must be prepared to appropriately regulate various problems that may arise due to the characteristics of RA.

Therefore, when designing the RA algorithm, conflicts of interest between financial investment companies and investors must be considered, and if this is violated, it may lead or be considered a violation of the Capital Markets Act. If the RA algorithm is designed to benefit the financial investment business operator, the financial investment business operator will be recognized as violating the duty of good faith and the duty to prevent conflicts of interest.However, even if there is an element of creating potential conflict of interest in the RA algorithm, there are limits to how investors can identify and respond to it. Therefore, there is a need to strengthen disclosure obligations for financial investment companies that use the RA algorithm so that investors can easily recognize the status and the possibility of conflicts of interest.

In addition, if it is acknowledged that the disclosure obligation has been violated, the burden of proof should be boldly shifted so that investors can easily hold financial investment companies, etc. accountable.In transactions through RA, disciplinary measures should also be put in place for those who obtain information through illegal methods such as hacking. The RA operator must exercise the duty of care as a good manager to ensure that electronic financial transactions are processed safely, and has an obligation to ensure the safety and reliability of electronic financial transactions, including anti-hacking measures. Therefore, if an investment customer suffers a loss due to RA management's negligence, it will be liable for damages under the Capital Markets Act and the Electronic Financial Transactions Act. In addition, if a financial investment business such as an RA management company goes bankrupt, relief for damage to investors may be incomplete, so it is necessary to operate an investor protection fund system to minimize the risk to the investors and as a preparedness measure."

Using a similar semantic space, we can analyze not only the similarities among reci-pes but also their diversity.

However, due to the randomness of artificial neural networks, such recurrent neural networks can generate different training results of models even under the same conditions, which can lead to inaccurate software reliability estimation. Therefore, this paper compares and analyzes which recurrent neural networks could estimate software reliability more stably and accurately. We estimated software reliability in eight real projects using three representative recurrent neural networks and compared and analyzed the performances of these models in terms of accuracy and stability. As a result, Long Short-Term Memory showed the most stable and accurate software reliability estimation performance.A more accurate and stable software reliability estimation model is expected to be selected based on the results of this study."

The article outlines the factors and facets of digital transformation. On this basis, the article discusses individual aspects of structural changes in business law, from the generation of the necessary regulatory knowledge in the regulation of data flows to limit market power on digital platforms, to the development of general, cross-sector requirements for AI systems that are classified as risky, to the digitalization of the law itself, including its application."

The data-based fault detection method requires a large amount of data for learning, and in particular, a large amount of data labeled as a fault state is essential. However, it is difficult to obtain large amounts of actual fault data in industrial settings. Therefore, in this study, the output of the collaborative robot fault state based on a vision sensor was analyzed and compared with the output of the normal state, and a fault injection method was proposed based on the deviation between the analyzed output signals. Collaborative robot data collected in the actual fault state could be replaced with data collected in the proposed fault injection state. The comparison of the performance of the model trained with fault injection data and trained with actual fault data confirmed that there was almost no difference, with an average of 0.97 and 0.98 accuracy, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed fault injection method."

These legal fields have independent, bureaucratic, and technical characteristics. However, it is not limited to this, but legal technology tools are also used in ordinary daily life such as traffic accidents.Nevertheless, due to the technical limitations of Legal Tech, it is expected that it will be able to function as a kind of very competent lawyer rather than complete automation. Most llegal technology tools are expected to operate within the paradigm of cognitive computing defined by human-machine collaboration. The development of legal technology tools in the United States is closely related to the adversarial system of civil litigation, and the system in which the parties take the lead in collecting evidence at the stage of pre-trial discovery can be seen as the background of the competitive development of the legal technology industry.In civil litigation in Korea, the formation of the contents of the trial is based on adversarial system, but in terms of the progress of the lawsuit, inquisitorial system is adopted so that the court takes the initiative to lead the hearing. In other words, the use of legal technology is likely to depend on the judgment of the court and the decision of the legislator, so there will be a limit to the size of the legal technology market to grow like the United States. If there is sufficient means of collecting evidence between parties, such as discovery system in US, the legal technology industry can take a leap forward."

There are many studies toassume the air temperature from the land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from satellites becausethe air temperature has a strong relationship with the LST. However, an algorithm of the LST, Level 2output of GK-2A, works only clear sky pixels. To overcome the cloud effects, we apply a deep neuralnetwork (DNN) model to assume the air temperature with L1B calibrated for radiometric and geometricsfrom raw satellite data and compare the model with a linear regression model between LST and airtemperature. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the air temperature for model outputs are used toevaluate the model. The number of 95 in-situ air temperature data was 2,496,634 and the ratio of datasetspaired with LST and L1B show 42.1% and 98.4%. The training years are 2020 and 2021 and 2022 isused to validate. The DNN model is designed with an input layer taking 16 channels and four hiddenfully connected layers to assume an air temperature. As a result of the model using 16 bands of L1B, theDNN with RMSE 2.22°C showed great performance than the baseline model with RMSE 3.55°C onclear sky conditions and the total RMSE including overcast samples was 3.33°C. It is suggested that the DNN is able to overcome cloud effects. However, it showed different characteristics in seasonal andhourly analysis and needed to append solar information as inputs to make a general DNN model becausethe summer and winter seasons showed a low coefficient of determinations with high standard deviations."

This is because existing integrated security products provide integrated interrelationships, but do not specify possible security incidents and rely heavily on human analysis by security personnel. Therefore, this paper introduces how to classify known security incidents and all possible types of security incidents into security threat strategies and tactics and introduces a technology that can simulate security incident profiling services based on scenarios through MITRE ATT&CK framework analysis. Hence, it may be possible to judge the prediction, response, and management of security accidents comprehensively."

However, prevailing labeling techniques in the financial sector predominantly concentrate on individual assets, posing a challenge in aligning with pair trading strategies. To address this issue, we propose an inventive approach that melds the Triple Barrier Labeling technique with pair trading, optimizing the resultant labels through genetic algorithms. Rigorous backtesting on cryptocurrency datasets illustrates that our proposed labeling method excels over traditional pair trading methods and corresponding buy-and-hold strategies in both profitability and risk control. This pioneering method offers a novel perspective on trading strategies and risk management within the financial domain, laying a robust groundwork for further enhancing the precision and reliability of pair trading strategies utilizing AI models."

However, the question is whether its scope can be extended to 'processing for service purposes but prohibiting pseudonymization'.Second, when a single organization does not possess big data to respond to the demand for data analysis such as artificial intelligence learning, there are many cases where multiple organizations combine their own data to fill in the gaps. In this case, if the consent of the information subject is not obtained in advance, pseudonymization is the only way to legally combine datasets under the current law. In this case, opting out of pseudonymization has a similar effect to opting out of statistical processing, and it is questionable whether the benefits of such pseudonymization have not been unduly diminished.Third, the effectiveness of various safeguards mandated by the current law to control the risk of re-identification of pseudonymized information has been neglected, and the risk of pseudonymized information has been inflated."
3D Measurement Using a Single Image for Smart Manufacturing of Microscopic Products in a Ceramic Powder Pressing Process,2023,"['Monocular depth estimation', 'Dimension measurement', 'Thickness measurement', 'Dimensional anomaly detection', 'Manufacturing']",,"Owing to the development of artificial intelligence, smart manufacturing has extensively been investigated, which has rapidly increased manufacturing productivity. The most prevalent smart manufacturing application using machine learning is product quality enhancement through surface and dimensional defect detection. Various sensors, such as stereoscopic, 2D, or 3D lasers as well as structured light sensors, have been used to perform precise thickness measurements. These sensors are expensive and they require a large space for installation in a factory, which consumes time and energy. Moreover, micro-scale dimensional measurement equipment is much more expensive and easily damaged by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. In the beginning, we introduce a single image-based 3D measurement system using depth estimation that makes dimensional anomaly detection easy and fast. This is important for green technology because the proposed method can reduce condemned or inferior goods by detecting anomalies early and save raw materials and energy consumption. The existing method is deep learning based depth estimation. However, it is difficult for conventional depth estimation methods to predict 3D measurement directly because of the difference between depth estimation and 3D measurement. That is because inputs are discontinuous dimensional values with homogeneous textures. Conventional depth estimation is a regression task that assumes inputs are continuous. To circumvent this problem, we propose a magnifier loss. In addition, to overcome the object’s homogeneity and meet the micro-scale dimensional precision requirement, this paper proposes a novel magnifier transformation function that magnifies the homogeneous textures and micro-scale dimensional value changes. This method achieves better quantitative performance than a conventional computer vision method, stereo-matching approaches, and even a structured light sensor, which is known to be one of most accurate and expensive sensors for a 3D measurement system."

Lee Byung-hun grew up with traditional Confucian studies, but in his 30s, he was absorbed in Western studies, and later recognized the religious role of Confucianism and immersed himself in the Confucian religious movement. In his later years, he was absorbed in the study of the Zhouyi 周易, and Suhwa Gaebyeokseol 水火開闢說 was his last work left at the age of 70 in 1939. This work borrows Shao Yong 邵雍’s theory of yixue, but contains Lee Byung-hun’s own theory of yixue. He suggested yuan 元, yun 運, hui 會, and shi 世 theories based on the four seasons, 12 months, and 24 seasons. This paper analyses where Lee Byung-hun’s own theory of yixue is based and what its characteristics are. His theory contains ideas about acceptance of Western scientific knowledge and the identity of the theory of the changes in Confucian classics, especially the Zhouyi.Lee Byung-hun’s theory of yixue is basically based on the principle of the order of changes in the natural world, but ultimately explores the rise and fall of human history and civilization history. He presented the 12 stages of East and West history development through the 12 sessions, which is likened to 12 months in a year. Along with the start of a new cycle of changes, gaebyeok 開闢, he mentioned the activities of Dongguk 東國 and Dongyi 東夷, the roots of Joseon, as the starting point and main body of Eastern civilization. And gradually, with the development of material civilization and democracy in the West, he approached critically the development of murder machines and the side effects of war and slaughter brought by the convenience of material civilization.  His frame on yixue encompasses a view of the future, specifically referring to the environmental problems that the pursuit of convenience can bring. This paper analyzes Lee Byung-hun’s historical perceptions, and contemporary tasks shown by his frame on yixue, and explores the message this sends to us today."

인공지능은 정말로 ‘인간의 형상’이 되어가고 있는가?,2023,"['인공지능 (AI)', '기독교교양학', '인간과 기계 사이의 질적 차이', '하나님의 형상', '인간존재의 의미', 'Artificial Intelligence (AI)', 'Christian Liberal Arts', 'Qualitative Differences Between Human and Machine', 'Image of God', 'Meaning of Human Existence']",,"As the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) proliferates, society has increasingly become reliant upon it for reasons of convenience and economic efficiency. This dependency is predicted to escalate, implying that roles traditionally undertaken by humans may be incrementally supplanted by AI. Should we encounter a world governed by entities mirroring us without profound contemplation on the significance of human existence, we risk losing our societal positioning. This study endeavors to explore the concept of AI —particularly as it develops in a manner akin to human evolution— and investigates strategies for engaging with it through the lens of Christian liberal arts.Christian liberal arts are perceived herein as a methodological framework that applies Christian values to the subjects and objectives of a conventional and universal liberal arts education, with an aim to cultivate a mature selfhood. This approach seeks to enhance Christian literacy in the contemporary era and broaden the application of Christian values through critical integration.Initially, this study discusses the origins and essence of AI from both humanistic and technological standpoints. While AI appears to have emulated human cognitive abilities somewhat successfully, particularly in aspects such as “autonomy,” “growth via learning,” and “linguistic capability” through artificial neural network models and deep learning technologies, its foundational algorithms and computational procedures present a qualitative divergence from human cognitive processes. Consequently, it becomes crucial to question the Christian perspective on the inherent roles and existential significance of humans that preserve the qualitative distinctions between humans and AI.The Bible characterizes humans as the “image of God” (Gen 1:26-27). In the same vein, “image” does not denote “homogeneity,” thereby cautioning against conflating similarity and homogeneity between humans and AI. It is essential to establish an ontological hierarchy based on the explicit qualitative disparities between humans and AI. According to biblical teachings, a profound relationship is forged between God and humans through the ‘spirit.’ However, humans have yet to devise mechanisms to form intimate relationships with AI. Hence, it would be infeasible to anticipate similar interactions with AI as we do with fellow humans. Recognizing that humans are organic beings amalgamated through a physical body, spirit, and mind helps us avoid the pitfall of a mechanistic perspective that attempts to define human existence through data and intelligence alone. Therefore, in order to continue maintaining our autonomous role as humans, we must deeply reflect on the meaning of our own existence."

A bio-medical snake optimizer system driven by logarithmic surviving global search for optimizing feature selection and its application for disorder recognition,2023,"['snake optimizer', 'evolutionary algorithms', 'selection systems', 'survival of the fittest principle', 'logarithmic function']",,"It is of paramount importance to enhance medical practices, given how important it is to protect human life. Medical therapy can be accelerated by automating patient prediction using machine learning techniques. To double the efficiency of classifiers, several preprocessing strategies must be adopted for their crucial duty in this field. Feature Selection (FS) is one tool that has been used frequently to modify data and enhance classification outcomes by lowering the dimensionality of datasets. Excluded features are those that have a poor correlation coefficient with the label class, i.e., they have no meaningful correlation with classification and do not indicate where the instance belongs. Along with the recurring features, which show a strong association with the remainder of the features. Contrarily, the model being produced during training is harmed, and the classifier is misled by their presence. This causes overfitting and increases algorithm complexity and processing time. The pattern is made clearer by FS, which also creates a broader classification model with a lower chance of overfitting in an acceptable amount of time and algorithmic complexity. To optimize the FS process, building wrappers must employ metaheuristic algorithms as search algorithms. The best solution, which reflects the best subset of features within a particular medical dataset that aids in patient diagnosis, is sought in this study using the Snake Optimizer (SO). The swarm-based approaches that SO is founded on have left it with several general flaws, like local minimum trapping, early convergence, uneven exploration and exploitation, and early convergence. By employing the cosine function to calculate the separation between the present solution and the ideal solution, the logarithm operator was paired with SO to better the exploitation process and get over these restrictions. In order to get the best overall answer, this forces the solutions to spiral downward. Additionally, SO is employed to put the evolutionary algorithms’ preservation of the best premise into practice. This is accomplished by utilizing three alternative selection systems – tournament, proportional, and linear – to improve the exploration phase. These are used in exploration to allow solutions to be found more thoroughly and in relation to a chosen solution than at random. These are Tournament Logarithmic Snake Optimizer (TLSO), Proportional Logarithmic Snake Optimizer, and Linear Order Logarithmic Snake Optimizer. A number of 22 reference medical datasets were used in experiments. The findings indicate that, among 86% of the datasets, TLSO attained the best accuracy, and among 82% of the datasets, the best feature reduction. In terms of the standard deviation, the TLSO also attained noteworthy reliability and stability. On the basis of running duration, it is, nonetheless, quite effective."
Cauchy mutation boosted Harris hawk algorithm: optimal performance design and engineering applications,2023,"['Harris hawks optimization', 'Cauchy mechanism', 'swarm intelligence algorithms', 'engineering problems']",,"Harris hawks optimization (HHO) has been accepted as one of the well-established swarm-based methods in the community of optimization and machine learning that primarily works based on multiple dynamic features and various exploratory and exploitative traits. Compared with other optimization algorithms, it has been observed that HHO can obtain high-quality solutions for continuous and constrained complex and real-world problems. While there is a wide variety of strategies in the HHO for dealing with diverse situations, there are chances for sluggish performance, where the convergence rate can gradually slow with time, and the HHO may stay stuck in the current relatively better place and may be unable to explore other better areas. To mitigate this concern, this paper combines the Cauchy mutation mechanism into the HHO algorithm named CMHHO. This idea can boost performance and provide a promising optimizer for solving complex optimization problems. The Cauchy mutation mechanism can speed up the convergence of the solution and help HHO explore more promising regions compared to its basic release. On 30 IEEE CEC2017 benchmark functions, the study compared the proposed CMHHO with various conventional and advanced metaheuristics to validate its performance and quality of solutions. It has been found through experiments that the overall optimization performance of CMHHO is far superior to all competitors. The CMHHO method is applied to four engineering challenges to investigate the capabilities of the proposed algorithm in solving real-world problems, and experimental results show that the suggested algorithm is more successful than existing algorithms."

However, topic modeling's usage in media research has recently come under fire for failing to take into account reliable and valid measures of theoretically defined concepts. This means that topic modeling needs methodological validation and reliability in order to be employed in media research as a tool for investigating and summarizing massive volumes of textual material. Additionally, it is helpful to be able to group online comments into ""issues"" and list their important points in order to quickly identify social issues and monitor discourse patterns in real-time on digital platforms. For this reason, attempts to diagnose the methodological validity of topic modeling for analyzing the topics of comments are of great significance. Therefore, this study validates topic modeling for analyzing online comments by verifying its performance as follows. First, we discussed why topic analysis of comments is necessary and what the implications are through the conceptualization of ""issues"" in the context of online comments. Then, with an emphasis on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, we reviewed the principle of topic modeling to estimate the topic of text and the assumptions of statistical models that affect topic estimation. Additionally, we contrasted the merits and drawbacks of LDA and the Biterm Topic Model (BTM) to suggest topic modeling as a means of identifying the subject of comments and categorizing them as ""issues."" Based on the above theoretical discussion, we applied topic modeling to analyze 9,000 online news comments on articles covering nine social issues and validate whether the topics are useful to classify comments according to the ""issues"" of the news. The results are as follows. First, compared to BTM, LDA is highly dependent on the hyperparameter, , with lower values leading to better model performance. Second, both BTM and LDA were able to estimate the optimal number of topics (K ), but BTM showed less variation in performance with value selection than LDA, and performance degradation was worse when the value was lower than the optimal K than when it was higher. Third, both BTM and LDA performed better when adding bigrams along with unigrams to the vocabulary, but the difference was more pronounced for LDA. Based on these validation results, we assessed the validity of topic modeling for analysis of comments and discussed its implications."

Enhancing the performance of deep neural networks is achieved by applying regularization techniques to the existing ground truth data. In many machine learning tasks requiring pixel-level segmentation sets, accurately delineating objects is vital. However, it proves challenging for thin and elongated objects such as blood vessels in X-ray coronary angiography, often resulting in inconsistent generation of ground truth data. This method involves an analysis of the quality of training set pairs - comprising images and ground truth data - to automatically regulate and modify the boundaries of ground truth segmentation. Employing the active contour model and a recursive ground truth generation approach results in stable and precisely defined boundary contours.

However, although the generated image looks like a photograph, the Chosun's hat expressed in the portrait were not synthesized properly. In other words, generative AI has revealed its limitations in transforming and distorting elements that are not in the learning data. In addition, when the GAN value is set to 100, in short, in the case of fully automatic generation, all portraits showed convergence to the stereotype.

Exploring Information Warfare Strategies during the Russia–Ukraine War on Twitter,2023,"['artificial intelligence', 'hybrid war', 'information warfare', 'Twitter', 'Russia–Ukraine war', 'social media']",,"Twitter, one of the mainstream social media platforms, has played a significant role in strategic communication and public diplomacy. Using tweets during the 2022 Russia–Ukraine war period as a case study, the researchers aim to build a pipeline that automatically detects information manipulation. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology are adopted to target certain coordinated groups of people, and how they manipulate online public opinion internationally via social media platforms by retweeting identical tweets between members within the groups and even with their own tweets. With the large number of tweets posted and retweeted by the coordinated groups, their intended content will appear in the news feeds of normal users. This study maps an approach to future warfare that social media is becoming a vital part of information warfare to influence the results of conflict and regional relationships. The researchers argue that the government should consider taking countermeasures: 1) Set up legislation regarding media platforms and cooperate with social media companies to monitor manipulating behaviors. 2) Establish a model to orchestrate inter-agency defensive strategies. 3) Increase people’s media literacy to allow them to be aware of manipulative and collaborative behavior and decrease their likeliness to spread fake/manipulated information online unintentionally.

METHODS Using the Python program, we performed web crawling and machine learning algorithms to analyze news articles for our research analyses. In particular, 696 articles on driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol were gathered and subject to descriptive scrutiny; a total of 782 sentences were selected for the analysis. Also, among the 509 articles on illegal gambling, 484 sentences were analyzed. Moreover, 50 frequently reported words were extracted from these sentences to assess their frequencies through the word cloud method for concrete visualization. Then, the data were mapped in order to systemically understand the communication strategy patterns for each case, which were dependent on the stakeholders and timing of the event. RESULTS The empirical results revealed that in case of unethical events of driving under the influence that were reported in the news, most of the subjects chose an apology strategy immediately, but for illegal gambling reports, the parties involved rarely respond and it was difficult to find specific strategy patterns among the subjects. CONCLUSIONS The present study reveals that when professional sports teams were exposed to transgression, depending on the characteristics of the event and stakeholders, they chose different communication strategies involving fan characteristics for the event and subjects.

Various stress-strain curves used for the machine learning are obtained by uniaxial, biaxial, planar tension tests on the chloroprene rubber specimens. Tests are carried out at a rate of 0.01 strain/s at 23 oC, and the Mullins effect is reflected through five load-unload processes in the strain range of 0 ~ 20 %, 0 ~ 50 %, 0 ~ 70 %, and 0 ~ 100 %. After training, the stress-strain relationships in untrained ranges are predicted. The predictions are compared with the experimental data in the strain range of 0 ~ 100 %, which was previously reserved to confirm the prediction performance. It was predicted with errors within 0.04, 0.08, and 0.01 MPa for the uniaxial, biaxial, and planar tests, respectively. These small errors indicate predictions are reliable. For optimization of rubber parts, material constants of Ogden model are obtained using the predicted data in the strain of 0 ~ 60 % and 0 ~ 80 %. Dust covers are optimized to reduce stresses by the Taguchi method. The maximum von Mises stresses in the optimal designs are reduced by approximately 8 % and 14 %, compared to the initial ones."

Specifically, researchers are actively pursuing the development of default prediction models using machine learning and deep learning algorithms, in contrast to traditional statistical default prediction methods, which struggle to capture nonlinearity. Among these efforts, Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture is noteworthy for predicting default in situations with limited data on thin filers. This is due to their ability to incorporate network information between borrowers alongside conventional credit-related data. However, prior research employing graph neural networks has faced limitations in effectively handling diverse categorical variables present in credit information. In this study, we introduce the Transformer embedded Graph Convolutional Network (TeGCN), which aims to address these limitations and enable effective default prediction for thin filers. TeGCN combines the TabTransformer, capable of extracting contextual information from categorical variables, with the Graph Convolutional Network, which captures network information between borrowers. Our TeGCN model surpasses the baseline model’s performance across both the general borrower dataset and the thin filer dataset. Specially, our model performs outstanding results in thin filer default prediction. This study achieves high default prediction accuracy by a model structure tailored to characteristics of credit information containing numerous categorical variables, especially in the context of thin filers with limited data.

In the aspect of sensitive image detection, the existing machine learning algorithms are confronted with problems such as large model size, long training time, and slow detection speed when auditing and supervising. In order to detect sensitive images more accurately and quickly, this paper proposes a multi-classification sensitive image detection method based on lightweight Convolutional Neural Network. On the basis of the EfficientNet model, this method combines the Ghost Module idea of the GhostNet model and adds the SE channel attention mechanism in the Ghost Module for feature extraction training. The experimental results on the sensitive image data set constructed in this paper show that the accuracy of the proposed method in sensitive information detection is 94.46% higher than that of the similar methods. Then, the model is pruned through an ablation experiment, and the activation function is replaced by Hard-Swish, which reduces the parameters of the original model by 54.67%. Under the condition of ensuring accuracy, the detection time of a single image is reduced from 8.88ms to 6.37ms. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the method put forward has successfully enhanced the precision of identifying multi-class sensitive images, significantly decreased the number of parameters in the model, and achieved higher accuracy than comparable algorithms while using a more lightweight model design."

Artificial Neural Network with Firefly Algorithm-Based Collaborative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks,2023,"['Channel Selection', 'Cognitive radio', 'Improved genetic algorithm', 'Spectrum Sensing', 'Spectrum assignment']",,"Recent advances in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) have elevated them to the status of a critical instrument for overcoming spectrum limits and achieving severe future wireless communication requirements. Collaborative spectrum sensing is presented for efficient channel selection because spectrum sensing is an essential part of CRNs. This study presents an innovative cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) model that is built on the Firefly Algorithm (FA), as well as machine learning artificial neural networks (ANN). This system makes use of user grouping strategies to improve detection performance dramatically while lowering collaboration costs. Cooperative sensing wasn't used until after cognitive radio users had been correctly identified using energy data samples and an ANN model. Cooperative sensing strategies produce a user base that is either secure, requires less effort, or is faultless. The suggested method's purpose is to choose the best transmission channel. Clustering is utilized by the suggested ANN-FA model to reduce spectrum sensing inaccuracy. The transmission channel that has the highest weight is chosen by employing the method that has been provided for computing channel weight. The proposed ANN-FA model computes channel weight based on three sets of input parameters: PU utilization, CR count, and channel capacity. Using an improved evolutionary algorithm, the key principles of the ANN-FA scheme are optimized to boost the overall efficiency of the CRN channel selection technique. This study proposes the Artificial Neural Network with Firefly Algorithm (ANN-FA) for cognitive radio networks to overcome the obstacles. This proposed work focuses primarily on sensing the optimal secondary user channel and reducing the spectrum handoff delay in wireless networks. Several benchmark functions are utilized We analyze the efficacy of this innovative strategy by evaluating its performance. The performance of ANN-FA is 22.72 percent more robust and effective than that of the other metaheuristic algorithm, according to experimental findings.The proposed ANN-FA model is simulated using the NS2 simulator, The results are evaluated in terms of average interference ratio, spectrum opportunity utilization, three metrics are measured: packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay, and end-to-average throughput for a variety of different CRs found in the network."

However, official foreign policy does not necessarily align with U.S. public perception of cross-strait relations.This research explores this divergence, focusing particularly on the era of Tsai Ing-wen’s presidency, which started in 2016. This study uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to analyze sentiments and emotions expressed in tweets related to Americans’ views on cross-strait relations. The findings reveal a complex emotional and sentiment landscape that goes beyond a binary positive–negative categorization. While sentiments appear balanced on the surface, a deeper analysis suggests that most Americans advocate a tougher U.S. stance against China. This tendency in opinion is likely due to several controversies surrounding President Trump’s stance on Taiwan. This study enriches existing theories of public opinion and international relations by incorporating social media data and underscores the intricate relationship between public sentiment and formal policy, offering critical insights for policymakers and diplomats in Taiwan."

However, studies exploring factors that may predict the quality of social media relationships are relatively rare. The present study investigated whether social media activity and psychological states, such as loneliness and depression, can predict the quality of social media relationships during the COVID-19 quarantine period using a machine learning technique. Ninety-five participants completed a self-report survey on loneliness, Instagram activity, quality of social media relationships, and depression at different time points (during the self-isolation and after the release of self-isolation). Similarity analyses, including multidimensional scaling (MDS), representational similarity analysis (RSA), and classification analyses, were conducted separately at each point in time. The results of MDS revealed that time spent on social media and depression were distinguished from others in the first dimension, and loneliness and passive use were distinguished from others in the second dimension. We divided the data into two groups based on the quality of social media relationships (high and low), and we conducted RSA on each group. Findings indicated an interaction between the quality of the social media relationships and the situation. Specifically, the effect of self-isolation on the high-quality social media relationship group is more pronounced than that on the low-quality group. The classification results also revealed that the predictors of social media relationships depend on whether or not they are isolated. Overall, the results of this study imply that social media relationship could be well predicted when people are not in isolated situations."

However, the management and evaluation typically associated with existing DMAs primarily focus on ensuring stable water volume and pressure. Consequently, these methods do not adequately address the maintenance of water quality elements within the water supply system, such as adequately managing residual chlorine and reducing water quality complaints. This study introduced a zoning tailored explicitly for managing water quality-oriented elements, facilitating stable water quality management, and enhancing responses to water quality incidents in large-scale domestic water supply networks. A method was proposed to establish priorities for each zone, using various geographic information system (GIS)-based water quality-related structured data (such as water quality measurement data and pipe data) and unstructured data (such as water quality complaints). Comprehensive water quality management was achieved by applying machine learning techniques based on clustering analysis to derive evaluation factors. The proposed methodology was implemented in Metropolitan City A in Korea, leading to the derivation and analysis of evaluation results. This data-centric water supply network priority management area designation methodology, as presented in this study, is anticipated to serve as a valuable decision-making tool for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of water supply network operation and the overall management of water supply operators."

Using GA - BP Coupling Algorithm to Predict the High-performance Concrete Mechanical Property,2023,"['High-performance concrete', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Back propagation neural network', 'Gray relational analysis', 'Compression strength']",,"As a cementitious composite, concrete’s property depends on the matrix generated from cement hydration and the dispersed phases such as aggregates. Compression strength is an important mechanics performance index of concrete quality, especially the High-performance Concrete (HPC). However, owing to the expensive cost of test and the existence of high-dimensional nonlinear mapping between compression strength and basic materials, it is uneasiness to precisely forecast the compression strength value of HPC by general formula method. In this research, a novel machine learning system, Genetic Algorithm and BP Neural Network (GA-BPNN) coupling algorithm, is offered to predict the compression strength of HPC. GA-BPNN coupling algorithm model used 181 groups of HPC mixture data to determine 8 factors affecting its compression strength (i.e., Water, Portland Cement, Water-binder Ratio, Fine Aggregate Ratio, Air-entraining Agent, Fly Ash, Silica Fume, and Superplasticizer) as the input variables of the model, while compression strength was set as the output variable. In addition, 166 sets of training set data were segmented into training, validation and test set again, and BP neural network (BPNN) was compared with GA-BPNN to verify the generalizationcapacity of the model in this research. By forecasting the compression strength of 15 test sets, the average relative error is only 0.902%. Finally, the sensitivity of input variables of GA-BPNN model was analyzed by using Gray Relational analysis (GRA) method. Six models were established to research the impact of sensitivity and quantity of input variables on model performance by ignoring individual input variable. The research is shown that GA-BPNN model not only has the powerful nonlinear mapping ability of BPNN, but also has the global search optimization ability of GA, and showed stronger robustness and prediction potential in the assessment of compression strength value of HPC. The sensitivity analysis shows that, to compression strength of HPC, Cement, Water and Water-binder ratio has a sensitivity score of 0.8166, 0.70122, 0.66772, respectively while Fly Ash has the lowest sensitivity."

The aim of this review is firstly to focus on the current use of widely available biomarkers and their performance for identifying ≥F3. Secondly, we discuss whether noninvasive biomarkers have a role in identifying F2, a stage of fibrosis that is now known to be a risk factor for cirrhosis and overall mortality. We also consider whether machine learning algorithms offer a better alternative for identifying individuals with ≥F2 fibrosis. Thirdly, we summarise the utility of noninvasive serum biomarkers for predicting liver related outcomes (e.g., ascites and hepatocellular carcinoma) and non-liver related outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular-related mortality and extra hepatic cancers). Finally, we examine whether serial measurement of biomarkers can be used to monitor liver disease, and whether the use of noninvasive biomarkers in drug trials for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis can accurately, compared to liver histology, monitor liver fibrosis progression/regression. We conclude by offering our perspective on the future of serum biomarkers for the detection and monitoring of liver fibrosis in NAFLD."

In 2022, the Movement Disorder Society proposed new diagnostic criteria to develop disease-modifying therapies and promote clinical trials of MSA since the second consensus was proposed in 2008. Regarding pathogenesis, cutting-edge findings have accumulated on the interactions of α-synuclein, neuroinflammation, and oligodendroglia with neurons. In neuroimaging, introducing artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning has notably improved diagnostic accuracy and individual analyses. Advancements in treatment have also been achieved, including immunotherapy therapy against α-synuclein and serotonin-targeted and mesenchymal stem cell therapies, which are thought to affect several aspects of the disease, including neuroinflammation. The accelerated progress in clarifying the pathogenesis of MSA over the past few years and the development of diagnostic techniques for detecting early-stage MSA are expected to facilitate the development of disease-modifying therapies for one of the most intractable neurodegenerative diseases."

보존지역의 합리적 관리를 위한 철새 서식 확률지도 구축 - 부산 Eco Delta City (EDC)를 중심으로 -,2023,"['conservation areas', 'EDC', 'XAI', 'SHAP']",,"In some areas of the Republic of Korea, the designation and management of conservation areas do not adequately reflect regional characteristics and often impose behavioral regulations without considering the local context. One prominent example is the Busan EDC area. As a result, conflicts may arise, including large-scale civil complaints, regarding the conservation and utilization of these areas. Therefore, for the efficient designation and management of protected areas, it is necessary to consider various ecosystem factors, changes in land use, and regional characteristics. In this study, we specifically focused on the Busan EDC area and applied machine learning techniques to analyze the habitat of regional species. Additionally, we employed Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to interpret the results of our analysis. To analyze the regional characteristics of the waterfront area in the Busan EDC district and the habitat of migratory birds, we used bird observations as dependent variables, distinguishing between presence and absence. The independent variables were constructed using land cover, elevation, slope, bridges, and river depth data. We utilized the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model, known for its excellent performance in various fields, to predict the habitat probabilities of 11 bird species. Furthermore, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique, one of the representative methodologies of XAI, to analyze the relative importance and impact of the variables used in the model. The analysis results showed that in the EDC business district, as one moves closer to the river from the waterfront, the likelihood of bird habitat increases based on the overlapping habitat probabilities of the analyzed bird species. By synthesizing the major variables influencing the habitat of each species, key variables such as rivers, rice fields, fields, pastures, inland wetlands, tidal flats, orchards, cultivated lands, cliffs & rocks, elevation, lakes, and deciduous forests were identified as areas that can serve as habitats, shelters, resting places, and feeding grounds for birds. On the other hand, artificial structures such as bridges, railways, and other public facilities were found to have a negative impact on bird habitat. The development of a management plan for conservation areas based on the objective analysis presented in this study is expected to be extensively utilized in the future. It will provide diverse evidential materials for establishing effective conservation area management strategies."
AI based energy harvesting security methods: A survey,2023,['Energy harvestingArtificial Intelligence(AI)Deep learningSecurityPrivacy'],,"Energy Harvesting (EH) as a power source plays a critical role in the advent of new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). But, by providing power within the networks, it may be susceptible to attacks such as eavesdropping, data manipulation, or denial of service, leading to issues like leakage of confidential, sensitive information, and energy scarcity. Therefore, it is important to implement appropriate security measures to protect the data and devices that use energy harvested from ambient sources. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the current and future developments of security for EH systems that used artificial intelligence(AI) approaches. Furthermore, we highlight the application of AI approaches such as machine learning (ML) and federated learning (FL) in the security of EH systems. Then, we discuss the security techniques that are used in the EH literature, including cryptography techniques, physical-layer security schemes, blockchain, and FL. Finally, we outline research challenges and prospects for developing and applying AI algorithms in the security of EH."

In addition, the change of Korean language education according to the advancement of ChatGPT's function was predicted, and the way Korean language education should go was explored in order to respond to it.As a generative and conversational artificial intelligence, the main features and functions of ChatGPT are as follows. First of all, as generative artificial intelligence, it searches and learns numerous materials on the Internet based on large language models and generative pre-trained transformer to produce results. Next, as a conversational artificial intelligence, it is possible to communicate in the form of daily conversation, remembers the contents of previous conversations, and reflects them in subsequent conversations. It works like a chatbot, and when you ask a question in the form of a ‘sentence’, the result is output in various ways, such as text.The following is a look at the impact that the advancement of the ChatGPT function will have on Korean language education and the countermeasures against it. First, the impact on Korean language education can be problems such as ① the challenge of writing education in general, ② the deepening of the ethical problem of writing, and ③ the spread of fake information. To respond to this, it is necessary to ① redefine the nature of writing education, ② (tentative name) strengthen writing ethics education by preparing ethical principles for writing using artificial intelligence, and ③ expand critical literacy education through critical reading instruction.The emergence of ChatGPT and the development of technology that is advancing day by day may be felt as a significant challenge toward Korean language education. However, rather than paying attention to its side effects or shortcomings, it is necessary to pay attention to the advantages of positive and instrumental use. Therefore, the exploration of how to utilize it from the point of view of win-win and coexistence and instrumental point of view, rather than the confrontation between machines and humans, will be much more productive and progressive. I hope that research on the use of artificial intelligence to support human growth will continue."

크라우드소싱 드론 영상의 기하학적 품질 자동 검증,2023,,,"The utilization of crowdsourced spatial data has been actively researched; however, issues stemming from the uncertainty of data quality have been raised. In particular, when low-quality data is mixed into drone imagery datasets, it can degrade the quality of spatial information output. In order to address these problems, the study presents a methodology for automatically validating the geometric quality of crowdsourced imagery. Key quality factors such as spatial resolution, resolution variation, matching point reprojection error, and bundle adjustment results are utilized. To classify imagery suitable for spatial information generation, training and validation datasets are constructed, and machine learning is conducted using a radial basis function (RBF)-based support vector machine (SVM) model. The trained SVM model achieved a classification accuracy of 99.1%. To evaluate the effectiveness of the quality validation model, imagery sets before and after applying the model to drone imagery not used in training and validation are compared by generating orthoimages. The results confirm that the application of the quality validation model reduces various distortions that can be included in orthoimages and enhances object identifiability. The proposed quality validation methodology is expected to increase the utility of crowdsourced data in spatial information generation by automatically selecting high-quality data from the multitude of crowdsourced data with varying qualities."

The Random Forest machine learning model was employed to evaluate the impact of individual papers within the mathematics education research network. The SHAP, an XAI model, was used to analyze the reasons behind the AI's assessment of impactful papers. Key features identified for determining impactful papers in the field of mathematics education through the XAI included 'paper network PageRank,' ‘changes in citations per paper,’ ‘total citations,’ ‘changes in the author's h-index,’ and ‘citations per paper of the journal.’ It became evident that papers, authors, and journals play significant roles when evaluating individual papers.

Notably, the significance of 'co-authorship network PageRank' was emphasized in domestic mathematics education research.The XAI model proposed in this study serves as a tool for determining the impact of papers using AI, providing researchers with strategic direction when writing papers. For instance, expanding the paper network, presenting at academic conferences, and activating the author network through co-authorship were identified as major elements enhancing the impact of a paper. Based on these findings, researchers can have a clear understanding of how their work is perceived and evaluated in academia and identify the key factors influencing these evaluations.This study offers a novel approach to evaluating the impact of mathematics education papers using an explainable AI model, traditionally a process that consumed significant time and resources.

The relative density of one pixel represents a relative difference from the surrounding pixels, and we also suggest a colorization of X-ray images representing these pixels as normal and defective. The traditional method mainly inspects materials such as plastics and metals, which have large differences in transmittance to the object. Our proposed method can be used to detect defects such as sprouts or holes in images obtained by an inspection machine that detects X-rays. In the experiment, the products that could not be seen with the naked eye were colored with pests or sprouts in a specific color so that they could be used in the agricultural product selection system. Products that are uniformly filled with a single ingredient inside, such as potatoes, carrots, and apples, can be detected effectively. However, it does not work well with bumpy products, such as peppers and paprika. The advantage of this method is that, unlike machine learning, it doesnt require large amounts of data. The proposed method could be applied to a screening system using X-rays and used not only in agricultural product screening systems but also in manufacturing processes such as processed food and parts manufacturing, so that it can be actively used to select defective products."

On the Data Features for Neighbor Path Selection in Computer Network with Regional Failure,2023,"['Neighbor Path Selection', 'Data Features', 'Heuristic Algorithm', 'Simulation']",,"This paper aims to investigate data features for neighbor path selection (NPS) in computer network with regional failures. It is necessary to find an available alternate communication path in advance when regional failures due to earthquakes or forest fires occur simultaneously. We describe previous general heuristics and simulation heuristic to solve the NPS problem in the regional fault network. The data features of general heuristics using proximity and sharing factor and the data features of simulation heuristic using machine learning are explained through examples. Simulation heuristic may be better than general heuristics in terms of communication success. However, additional data features are necessary in order to apply the simulation heuristic to the real environment. We propose novel data features for NPS in computer network with regional failures and Keras modeling for computing the communication success probability of candidate neighbor path."
A Radiomics-Based Model for Potentially More Accurate Identification of Subtypes of Breast Cancer Brain Metastases,2023,"['Breast cancer', 'brain metastasis', 'radiomics', 'magnetic resonance imaging']",,"Purpose: Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) may involve subtypes that differ from the primary breast cancer lesion. This study aimed to develop a radiomics-based model that utilizes preoperative brain MRI for multiclass classification of BCBM sub types and to investigate whether the model offers better prediction accuracy than the assumption that primary lesions and their BCBMs would be of the same subtype (non-conversion model) in an external validation set.Materials and Methods: The training and external validation sets each comprised 51 cases (102 cases total). Four machine learn ing classifiers combined with three feature selection methods were trained on radiomic features and primary lesion subtypes for prediction of the following four subtypes: 1) hormone receptor (HR)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-, 2) HR+/HER2+, 3) HR-/HER2+, and 4) triple-negative. After training, the performance of the radiomics-based model was compared to that of the non-conversion model in an external validation set using accuracy and F1-macro scores.Results: The rate of discrepant subtypes between primary lesions and their respective BCBMs were 25.5% (n=13 of 51) in the training set and 23.5% (n=12 of 51) in the external validation set. In the external validation set, the accuracy and F1-macro score of the radiomics-based model were significantly higher than those of the non-conversion model (0.902 vs. 0.765, p=0.004; 0.861 vs. 0.699, p=0.002).Conclusion: Our radiomics-based model represents an incremental advance in the classification of BCBM subtypes, thereby fa cilitating a more appropriate personalized therapy."
보존지역의 합리적 관리를 위한 철새 서식 확률지도 구축 - 부산 Eco Delta City (EDC)를 중심으로 -,2023,"['conservation areas', 'EDC', 'XAI', 'SHAP']",,"In some areas of the Republic of Korea, the designation and management of conservation areas do not adequately reflect regional characteristics and often impose behavioral regulations without considering the local context. One prominent example is the Busan EDC area. As a result, conflicts may arise, including large-scale civil complaints, regarding the conservation and utilization of these areas. Therefore, for the efficient designation and management of protected areas, it is necessary to consider various ecosystem factors, changes in land use, and regional characteristics. In this study, we specifically focused on the Busan EDC area and applied machine learning techniques to analyze the habitat of regional species. Additionally, we employed Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to interpret the results of our analysis. To analyze the regional characteristics of the waterfront area in the Busan EDC district and the habitat of migratory birds, we used bird observations as dependent variables, distinguishing between presence and absence. The independent variables were constructed using land cover, elevation, slope, bridges, and river depth data. We utilized the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model, known for its excellent performance in various fields, to predict the habitat probabilities of 11 bird species. Furthermore, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique, one of the representative methodologies of XAI, to analyze the relative importance and impact of the variables used in the model. The analysis results showed that in the EDC business district, as one moves closer to the river from the waterfront, the likelihood of bird habitat increases based on the overlapping habitat probabilities of the analyzed bird species. By synthesizing the major variables influencing the habitat of each species, key variables such as rivers, rice fields, fields, pastures, inland wetlands, tidal flats, orchards, cultivated lands, cliffs & rocks, elevation, lakes, and deciduous forests were identified as areas that can serve as habitats, shelters, resting places, and feeding grounds for birds. On the other hand, artificial structures such as bridges, railways, and other public facilities were found to have a negative impact on bird habitat. The development of a management plan for conservation areas based on the objective analysis presented in this study is expected to be extensively utilized in the future. It will provide diverse evidential materials for establishing effective conservation area management strategies."

While the first and second industrial revolutions accelerated the automation of physical labor, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, represented by data-driven artificial intelligence, is revolutionizing cognitive labor automation in all industries. Initially, the goal of artificial intelligence was to implement systems that could make judgments like humans by transferring the knowledge accumulated by humans to computers. However, it has now evolved into data-driven artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning and deep learning, enabling machines to develop capabilities similar to human abstract thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, which were previously difficult to implement. Data-driven artificial intelligence will evolve in the future to compete or collaborate with humans in various fields. On the one hand, there is concern about artificial intelligence threatening our jobs, while on the other hand, we encounter chatbots or chat-based AI systems in our daily lives. Artificial intelligence is being integrated into processes in a variety of sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, distribution, transportation, and electronics, becoming an integral part of our daily lives.In the future, there is a high possibility that personal proficiency and competence in digital technologies, particularly in handling artificial intelligence, will create social, cultural, and economic disparities. To adapt to such changes and promote human progress, it is crucial for humans and computers (artificial intelligence, robots) to move towards collaboration and coexistence, rather than confrontation and competition. By leveraging the strengths of both humans and artificial intelligence, we can achieve more effective and efficient outcomes. Humans can contribute their cognitive abilities, creativity, emotional intelligence, and ethical considerations, while AI can provide data analysis, pattern recognition, automation, and optimization capabilities. By designing collaborative models that effectively integrate human and AI capabilities, we can maximize the potential of both and create a synergistic relationship."
"Black-box Medicine with AI/ML Technology Regulation: Clinical Roles, Relations, and Risks",2023,"['Artificial intelligence', 'black box', 'medicine', 'FDA', 'KFDA', '인공지능', '블랙박스', '의약품', 'FDA', '식약청']",,"This study discusses the issues with black-box medicine, including the challenges or barriers to fostering trust in artificial intelligence systems for their eventual integration, use, and adoption in medical settings. It also explores potential medical liabilities such as legal and ethical issues, which are novel and unresolved in terms of potential errors or harms caused by artificial intelligence diagnoses or treatment recommendations. Finally, these subjects also necessitate a brief examination of changing physician roles, in that black-box algorithms will eventually affect the relationships between patient and physicians when artificial intelligence becomes capable of simulating, assisting, or replacing traditionally human physician tasks. Technological advances in the form of black-box medicine as well as artificial intelligence generally and machine learning continue to affect regulatory frameworks and perceived risks. Regarding the implementation of these tools in medical devices, there is a need for greater clarity to ensure safety for patients while also being responsive to claims of efficacy or utility. Specifically, increasing the explanatory power of these technologies in the course of medical artificial intelligence development also furthers these twin goals. Technology usage for general scientific applications like drug discovery further highlights the potentially pervasive effects of black-box medicine on overall human health. At the same, separate issues arise concerning broader artificial intelligence safety and related areas such as bias far beyond mere medical outcomes. These uncertainties are by no means easily resolved, and they require the careful deliberation of interdisciplinary analysis drawing from legal, medical, and other expert backgrounds. In particular, it is necessary for lawmakers and regulators to be knowledgeable about the clinical impact of these tools as well as their impact on standard industry norms for policy goals . While the rapid development of new artificial intelligence models continues to improve human health, there are ongoing risks involved with regard to the way that decisions are made. Although unsupervised learning from artificial intelligence in medicine presents an opportunity, safety and other issues may mitigate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based studies by clinicians in the absence of additional protections. Reassuring patients as well as clinicians about artificial intelligence safety is imperative and promotes debate about the necessity of supporting or replacing clinical judgment in a healthcare context. This tension between human users and the new models as utilized in treatment underscores the idea that these technologies have the potential to either supplant human skills or augment them, depending on the needs of the medical setting. United States and Korean regulations also suggest that at the level of algorithms in black-box medicine, additional scrutiny may be warranted. Concerns about the opaqueness or black-box nature of an algorithm itself also give rise to calls for interpretability and developer awareness. Rapid product improvement with effective safeguards and pre-market approval prompt additional areas of analysis as medicine and other areas of science strive to balance the goal of enhancing medicine with the underlying nature of black-box medicine as algorithms which may not be capable of perfect transparency. In summary, black-box medicine suggests a new challenge in medicine which also begets opportunities. However, it also calls for detailed supervision in policy and practice with sound methodologies both to assure its ethical deployment and to foster trust towards innovative medical technologies."

To achieve this, data from a total of 2,095 participants without missing values were utilized from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS) 2018, focusing on the middle school panel's first to fourth years. Addressing limitations in previous research that often neglected the longitudinal nature of suicidal ideation or incorporated only specific predictive factors based on certain perspectives, this study utilized the latent class growth analysis(LCGA) to identify the trajectory of changes in adolescent suicidal ideation. Additionally, a classification model was constructed using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to classify the identified trajectories. The constructed model encompassed 155 predictive factors related to individual, family, school, and online systems.The results showed that the study participants were categorized into a high-risk group characterized by consistently intensifying suicidal ideation and a low-risk group maintaining lower levels of suicidal ideation. Among the top 10 influential variables for classification, several factors within the individual domain(depression, self-esteem, somatization, aggression, life satisfaction, BMI, and weekend bedtime) held substantial importance, with psychological and emotional variables being particularly pronounced. Moreover, school-related factors(academic helplessness, academic dedication and teacher relationships) were also partially included. Building on these findings, the study provides scholarly implications and suggests policy and practical intervention strategies concerning adolescent suicidal ideation."

Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a helpful technique that can be used to measure blood-glucose concentration without a blood sample. To facilitate such noninvasive in-vivo estimation, we propose a model based on the Beer-Lambert law for measuring blood-glucose concentration using the PPG signal. Notably, only two wavelengths are used. First, the oxygen saturation (SpO2) is estimated from the ratio of absorbance at two wavelengths, then another absorbance ratio is presented, and the blood-glucose concentration is estimated by substituting the SpO2 estimated earlier to this ratio. The PPG signals from 40 subjects were collected along with their reference blood-glucose concentrations and SpO2 values. The PPG-based blood-glucose concentrations are then calculated using mathematical equations derived from the Beer-Lambert law. A supervised machine learning model, XGBoost, is applied to calibrate the estimation model with the reference values measured using a commercial device; according to our experimental results, the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) value is 0.85. The proposed model based on the Beer-Lambert law thus provides a method for in-vivo estimation of blood glucose in daily applications."

온라인 리뷰 데이터 기반의 조직몰입도 측정 체계 구축에 대한 연구,2023,"['Engagement', 'HR Analytics', 'Sentence-BERT', 'Online Review', 'Survey']",,"People want to work for companies with good organizational cultures. Organizational culture is the overall atmosphere of a company, including the ways employees work and the company's operational policy. Organizational culture is the result of transferring core values containing the CEO's beliefs and management philosophy to employees. It is an intangible competitive edge that can differentiate the company from its competitors. In addition, the higher the engagement of employees in strong organizational culture, the better the management performance. Therefore, CEOs want high organizational engagement of employees and want to manage the level of engagement of employees. However, the definition of organizational engagement and the criteria to measure it differs across measuring agencies. This makes it almost impossible to compare the organizational engagement levels among peer companies and difficult to manage or improve them. Furthermore, employee surveys, the most widely used current way to measure the organizational engagement level, have some structural limitations, including the risk of potential distortion and biased answers. To address this problem, we propose a new organizational engagement measurement system using machine learning techniques on online review data about corporates. Using a large amount of data collected from a global corporate review online site, where employees voluntarily and anonymously make posts about their companies, we show that our proposed model is effective compared to the traditional survey-based methods. This new approach to measuring the organizational engagement level does not only enable employees to constantly understand their perception of the company and explain essential phenomena, but also complements the high-cost survey-based diagnostic methods."
Effect of the number of QTL of carcass weight on the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values in Hanwoo,2023,"['Hanwoo', 'QTL', 'GWAS', 'Random Forest', 'GEBV']",,"The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the number of QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) affecting the carcass weight of Hanwoo and the accuracy of GEBV (Genomic Estimated Breeding Values). The study was performed simulation study to generate three populations comprising 100, 500 and 1,000 QTL. Each population consisted of 13,500 individuals which were selected from the 6th to 10th generations of all 10 generations, while keeping litter size constant (N=1) in population parameters. The genetic parameters for these populations were set at 0.45 trait heritability, 0.3 QTL heritability and 48,578 total markers. In order to confirm the number of significant QTL under the threshold of Bonferroni correction, both GWAS (Genome-wide association study) and GWAS based on Random Forest (RF) were performed. In each population, there were 33, 50 and 32 QTL identified by only GWAS, with 100, 500 and 1,000 QTL. Additionally, RF-based GWAS detected 65, 260 and 491. These results showed that the number of significant QTL is not related to the overall number of QTL in the population. Furthermore, machine learning based GWAS is more accurate than solely using GWAS. To estimate the accuracy of GEBV (Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) in each population, 5-fold cross-validation was employed using SNP effect of the QTL over p-value. In the result of the estimation, GEBV rose with an increase in the number of QTL in the population, and the correlation between TBV (True Breeding Values) followed the same tendency. As a result, this study suggested that the number of QTL related to carcass weight in Hanwoo could exert a significant influence on genetic improvement."
Impact of Criterion Versus Norm-Referenced Assessment on the Quality of Life in Korean Medical Students,2023,"['Criterion-Referenced Assessment', 'Medical Education', 'Quality of Life', 'Stress', 'Burnout', 'Depression']",,"Background: Medical students are known to be subjected to immense stress under competitive curricula and have a high risk of depression, burnout, anxiety and sleep disorders. There is a global trend of switching from norm-referenced assessment (NRA) to criterion-referenced assessment (CRA), and these changes may have influenced the quality of life (QOL), sleep phase, sleep quality, stress, burnout, and depression of the medical students. We hypothesized that there is a significant difference of QOL between CRA and NRA and that sleep, stress, burnout, and depression are the main contributors.Methods: By administering an online survey regarding QOL and its contributors to Korean medical students, 365 responses from 10 medical schools were recorded. To clarify the complex relationship between the multiple factors in play, we applied nonlinear machine learning algorithms and utilized causal structure learning techniques on the survey data.Results: Students with CRA had lower scores in stress (68.16 ± 11.29, 76.03 ± 12.38, P < 0.001), burnout (48.09 ± 11.23, 55.93 ± 13.07, P < 0.001), depression (12.77 ± 9.82, 16.44 ± 11.27, P = 0.003) and higher scores in QOL (95.79 ± 16.20, 89.65 ± 16.28, P < 0.001) compared with students with NRA. Multiple linear regression, permutation importance of the random forest model and the causal structure model showed that depression, stress and burnout are the most influential factors of QOL of medical students.Conclusion: Medical students from schools that use CRA showed higher QOL scores, as well as lower burnout, stress and depression when compared with students from schools that use NRA. These results may be used as a basis for granting justification for the transition to CRA."

New Data Driven Scheme for Real-Time Power System Transient Stability Assessment,2023,"['Empirical wavelet transform', 'Power system transient stability assessment', 'Random Forest classifier', 'Synchrophasors technology', 'Teager–Kaiser energy operator']",,"A computational efficient and precise approach for real-time power system transient stability assessment (TSA), with post disturbance synchronized data is proposed in this paper. An empirical wavelet transform (EWT), Teager Kaiser energy changes (TKE) and Random Forest (RF) based new scheme is proposed to assess TSA. Based on the generator bus frequency and angles, a novel Robust Transient Stability Index (RTSI) is proposed to capture real-time status of power network. The EWT is utilized to decompose the proposed multi-component index into various intrinsic mode functions (modes). Subsequently, instantaneous energy change within each mode is calculated using Teager–Kaiser energy operator (TKEO). The energy changes in each mode defines decision boundary between transient stable and unstable operating scenario. Finally, for each mode, standard deviation of these energy changes is obtained to measure the variations in energy change about mean value. The Random Forest classification scheme is developed to obtain the TSA in real-time. The developed classifier predicts TSA using standard deviation of these energy changes. Simulation results and comparison with relevance minimum redundancy arithmetic, deep imbalanced learning framework and improved support vector machine methods demonstrates capability of the proposed scheme."
Hybrid neural network-based metaheuristics for prediction of financial markets: a case study on global gold market,2023,"['bidirectional gated recurrent unit', 'convolutional neural network', 'firefly algorithm', 'moth-flame optimization algorithm', 'precious metals market', 'prediction']",,"Technical analysis indicators are popular tools in financial markets. These tools help investors to identify buy and sell signals with relatively large errors. The main goal of this study is to develop new practical methods to identify fake signals obtained from technical analysis indicators in the precious metals market. In this paper, we analyze these indicators in different ways based on the recorded signals for 10 months. The main novelty of this research is to propose hybrid neural network-based metaheuristic algorithms for analyzing them accurately while increasing the performance of the signals obtained from technical analysis indicators. We combine a convolutional neural network and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit whose hyperparameters are optimized using the firefly metaheuristic algorithm. To determine and select the most influential variables on the target variable, we use another successful recently developed metaheuristic, namely, the moth-flame optimization algorithm. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed models with other state-of-the-art single and hybrid deep learning and machine learning methods from the literature. Finally, the main finding is that the proposed neural network-based metaheuristics can be useful as a decision support tool for investors to address and control the enormous uncertainties in the financial and precious metals markets."

These efforts range from traditional classification algorithms to machine learning and neural networks. However, challenges persist in effectively classifying waste in diverse environments and conditions due to insufficient datasets, increased complexity in neural network architectures, and performance limitations for real-world applications. Therefore, this paper proposes i-YOLOX as a solution for rapid classification and improved accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated based on network parameters, detection speed, and accuracy. To achieve this, a dataset comprising 10,000 samples of household waste, spanning 17 waste categories, is created. The i-YOLOX architecture is constructed by introducing the Involution channel convolution operator and the Convolution Branch Attention Module (CBAM) into the YOLOX structure. A comparative analysis is conducted with the performance of the existing YOLO architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that i-YOLOX enhances the detection speed and accuracy of waste objects in complex scenes compared to conventional neural networks. This confirms the effectiveness of the proposed i-YOLOX architecture in the detection and classification of multiple household waste objects."

Exploring AI Principles in Global Top 500 Enterprises: A Delphi Technique of LDA Topic Modeling Results,2023,"['AI principle', 'AI ethics', 'LDA', 'Delphi', 'Enterprise AI']",,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has already penetrated deeply into our daily lives, and we live with the convenience of it anytime, anywhere, and sometimes even without us noticing it. However, because AI is imitative intelligence based on human Intelligence, it inevitably has both good and evil sides of humans, which is why ethical principles are essential. The starting point of this study is the AI principles for companies or organizations to develop products. Since the late 2010s, studies on ethics and principles of AI have been actively published. This study focused on AI principles declared by global companies currently developing various products through AI technology. So, we surveyed the AI principles of the Global 500 companies by market capitalization at a given specific time and collected the AI principles explicitly declared by 46 of them. AI analysis technology primarily analyzed this text data, especially LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling, which belongs to Machine Learning (ML) analysis technology. Then, we conducted a Delphi technique to reach a meaningful consensus by presenting the primary analysis results. We expect to provide meaningful guidelines in AI-related government policy establishment, corporate ethics declarations, and academic research, where debates on AI ethics and principles often occur recently based on the results of our study."
Neurosurgical Management of Cerebrospinal Tumors in the Era of Artificial Intelligence : A Scoping Review,2023,['Artificial intelligence · Neurosurgery · Central nervous system neoplasms · Disease management'],,"Central nervous system tumors are identified as tumors of the brain and spinal cord. The associated morbidity and mortality of cerebrospinal tumors are disproportionately high compared to other malignancies. While minimally invasive techniques have initiated a revolution in neurosurgery, artificial intelligence (AI) is expediting it. Our study aims to analyze AI’s role in the neurosurgical management of cerebrospinal tumors. We conducted a scoping review using the Arksey and O’Malley framework.Upon screening, data extraction and analysis were focused on exploring all potential implications of AI, classification of these implications in the management of cerebrospinal tumors. AI has enhanced the precision of diagnosis of these tumors, enables surgeons to excise the tumor margins completely, thereby reducing the risk of recurrence, and helps to make a more accurate prediction of the patient’s prognosis than the conventional methods. AI also offers real-time training to neurosurgeons using virtual and 3D simulation, thereby increasing their confidence and skills during procedures. In addition, robotics is integrated into neurosurgery and identified to increase patient outcomes by making surgery less invasive. AI, including machine learning, is rigorously considered for its applications in the neurosurgical management of cerebrospinal tumors. This field requires further research focused on areas clinically essential in improving the outcome that is also economically feasible for clinical use. The authors suggest that data analysts and neurosurgeons collaborate to explore the full potential of AI."
An analysis of the waning effect of COVID-19 vaccinations,2023,"['booster doses', 'COVID-19', 'immunity', 'vaccination', 'waning effect']",,"Vaccine development is one of the key efforts to control the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it has become apparent that the immunity acquired through vaccination is not permanent, known as the waning effect. Therefore, monitoring the proportion of the population with immunity is essential to improve the forecasting of future waves of the pandemic. Despite this, the impact of the waning effect on forecasting accuracies has not been extensively studied. We proposed a method for the estimation of the effective immunity (EI) rate which represents the waning effect by integrating the second and booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines. The EI rate, with different periods to the onset of the waning effect, was incorporated into three statistical models and two machine learning models. Stringency Index, omicron variant BA.5 rate (BA.5 rate), booster shot rate (BSR), and the EI rate were used as covariates and the best covariate combination was selected using prediction error. Among the prediction results, Generalized Additive Model showed the best improvement (decreasing 86% test error) with the EI rate. Furthermore, we confirmed that South Korea's decision to recommend booster shots after 90 days is reasonable since the waning effect onsets 90 days after the last dose of vaccine which improves the prediction of confirmed cases and deaths. Substituting BSR with EI rate in statistical models not only results in better predictions but also makes it possible to forecast a potential wave and help the local community react proactively to a rapid increase in confirmed cases."

Currently, heavy rain watch and heavy rain warning by the criteria of the Korea Meteorological Administration are being issued in Korea. However, since this one criterion is applied to the whole country, we can not clearly recognize heavy rain damage for a specific region in advance. Therefore, in this paper, we tried to reset the current criteria for a special weather report which considers the regional characteristics and to predict the damage caused by rainfall after 1 hour. The study area was selected as Gyeonggi-province, where has more frequent heavy rain damage than other regions. Then, the rainfall inducing disaster or hazard-triggering rainfall was set by utilizing hourly rainfall and heavy rain damage data, considering the local characteristics. The heavy rain damage prediction model was developed by a decision tree model and a random forest model, which are machine learning technique and by rainfall inducing disaster and rainfall data. In addition, long short-term memory and deep neural network models were used for predicting rainfall after 1 hour. The predicted rainfall by a developed prediction model was applied to the trained classification model and we predicted whether the rain damage after 1 hour will be occurred or not and we called this as 1ST-Model. The 1ST-Model can be used for preventing and preparing heavy rain disaster and it is judged to be of great contribution in reducing damage caused by heavy rain."

First, I explain Polanyi’s theory, which illuminates the tacit dimension of human knowledge and performance. Then I discuss computer science’s development direction and limitations through three paradoxes (Menon’s paradox, Polanyi’s paradox, and Moravec’s paradox). Next, I analyze a tacit dimension and creativity in Lichtenstein’s paintings which appropriate the comic cuts. These include his ability to comprehensively read the art world based on accumulated artistic practices and experimentations and his strategy of presenting new creativity in the painting by intentionally choosing technical imitation instead of the artist’s autonomy. Today’s Image-generating AI learns from data that labels Lichtenstein’s paintings as his visual elements and artistic patterns. In that respect, generative AI machine learning takes Lichtenstein’s creative characteristics from the process he trained the mechanical vision and imitated the technical expressions of printed comics by hand. In conclusion, my paper suggests an interdisciplinary understanding of the loop interactive paradigm of humans, technology, and art and the tacit dimension of artists."

Intelligent control of robotic manipulators: a comprehensive review,2023,"['Robotic manipulators', 'Intelligent control', 'Metaheuristic algorithm', 'ANN']",,"Technological advancements in robotics significantly impact the design of robotic manipulators and their control. Manipulators find applications in electrical, mechanical, and process industries to reduce labor and improve accuracy. Controlling manipulators is challenging because of their complex dynamics and nonlinear properties. Researchers are exploring many ways to implement the effective control method, including classical and modern techniques. In all the applications, robotic manipulators interact with the real world. Therefore, they require an understanding of input–output relations, which raises the need for intelligent control methods. The revolutionized growth in artificial intelligence has significantly influenced robotic manipulators' control. This paper presents a detailed review of intelligent control techniques implemented on robotic manipulator systems. These intelligent control methods include artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic control, expert systems, metaheuristic algorithm, machine learning control, etc. These intelligent methods for robotic manipulators have gained more attention because they emulate human intelligence, which finds application in diverse fields of science and engineering. In this paper, authors have investigated and compared metaheuristic algorithm and their application in robotic manipulators."
Single-cell characterization of macrophages in uveal melanoma uncovers transcriptionally heterogeneous subsets conferring poor prognosis and aggressive behavior,2023,,,"Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most frequent primary intraocular malignancy with high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Macrophages represent one of the most abundant infiltrating immune cells with diverse functions in cancers. However, the cellular heterogeneity and functional diversity of macrophages in UM remain largely unexplored. In this study, we analyzed 63,264 single-cell transcriptomes from 11 UM patients and identified four transcriptionally distinct macrophage subsets (termed MΦ-C1 to MΦ-C4). Among them, we found that MΦ-C4 exhibited relatively low expression of both M1 and M2 signature genes, loss of inflammatory pathways and antigen presentation, instead demonstrating enhanced signaling for proliferation, mitochondrial functions and metabolism. We quantified the infiltration abundance of MΦ-C4 from single-cell and bulk transcriptomes across five cohorts and found that increased MΦ-C4 infiltration was relevant to aggressive behaviors and may serve as an independent prognostic indicator for poor outcomes. We propose a novel subtyping scheme based on macrophages by integrating the transcriptional signatures of MΦ-C4 and machine learning to stratify patients into MΦ-C4-enriched or MΦ-C4-depleted subtypes. These two subtypes showed significantly different clinical outcomes and were validated through bulk RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence assays in both public multicenter cohorts and our in-house cohort. Following further translational investigation, our findings highlight a potential therapeutic strategy of targeting macrophage subsets to control metastatic disease and consistently improve the outcome of patients with UM."

동아시아 대기의 강 탐지 알고리즘 비교,2023,"['atmospheric rivers', 'detection algorithm', 'East Asian summer', 'AR precipitation']",,"This study compares the three detection algorithms of East Asian summer atmospheric rivers (ARs). The algorithms developed by Guan and Waliser (GW15), Park et al. (P21), and Tian et al. (T23) are particularly compared in terms of the AR frequency, the number of AR events, and the AR duration for the period of 2016-2020. All three algorithms show similar spatio- temporal distributions of AR frequency, centered along the edge of the North Pacific high.The maximum AR frequency gradually shifts northward in early summer as the edge of the North Pacific High expands, and retreats in late summer. However, the detailed pattern and the maximum value differ among the algorithms. When the AR frequency is decomposed into the number of AR events and the AR duration, the AR frequencies detected by GW15 and P21 are equally explained by both factors. However, the number of AR events primarily determine the AR frequency in T23. This difference occurs as T23 utilizes the machine learning algorithm applied to moisture field while GW15 and P21 apply the threshold value to moisture transport field. When evaluating AR-related precipitation, the ARs detected by P21 show the closest relationship with total precipitation in East Asia by up to 60%. These results indicate that AR detection in the East Asian summer is sensitive to the choice of the detection algorithm and can be optimized for the target region."

Artificial intelligence humanities are not simply a fusion of artificial intelligence and humanities. It is an interdisciplinary field of study that seeks to interpret the era of artificial intelligence from the perspective of the humanities and to analyze society using artificial intelligence technology. Focusing on the research achievements of members of the Chung-Ang University Humanities Research Institute, who started and studied artificial intelligence humanities, a keyword network analysis was conducted to determine the research impact on the relationship with papers citing these achievements. As a result of extracting high-frequency vocabulary from a total of six research areas by adding the field of ‘pedagogy’ to the five research areas of artificial intelligence humanities, which are ‘relational communication, technology criticism, data analysis, socio-cultural studies, and ethical norms’. ‘Metaverse, AI, education, virtual, public language, and Korean’ were extracted in ‘relational communication studies’. In ‘technology criticism’ area, ‘AI, posthuman, digital, education, technology, and robot’, and in ‘data analysis’ area, ‘AI, machine learning, education, text mining, big data, and language network’ were identified as a high-frequency vocabulary. In ‘socio-cultural studies’, there are ‘AI, digital, humanities, education, history, and digital humanities’, in ‘ethical norms’, ‘AI, ethics, robots, morality, technology, and education’ were, and in ‘pedagogy’, ‘AI, education, literacy, and liberal arts education’ were respectively extracted as a high-frequency vocabulary.This study attempts to determine the current state of artificial intelligence humanities. Although six years is not a long time for the establishment and development of an academic discipline, it is meaningful because it confirms the position of a new academic discipline and the direction of future research. Humanities can no longer be understood as separate from technology; at this point in time, when fundamental questions are being asked about the boundary between humans and machines, efforts are needed to more actively understand technology and convergence methods to protect human dignity and explore ways to build a healthy society. Thus, the current state of artificial intelligence humanities research will serve as an important foundation for future thinking and planning."
Enhancing Acute Kidney Injury Prediction through Integration of Drug Features in Intensive Care Units,2023,"['Acute Kidney Injury', 'Healthcare', 'EHR', 'Drug Embeddings']",,"The relationship between acute kidney injury (AKI) prediction and nephrotoxic drugs, or drugs that adversely affect kidney function, is one that has yet to be explored in the critical care setting. One contributing factor to this gap in research is the limited investigation of drug modalities in the intensive care unit (ICU) context, due to the challenges of processing prescription data into the corresponding drug representations and a lack in the comprehensive understanding of these drug representations. This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel approach that leverages patient prescription data as a modality to improve existing models for AKI prediction. We base our research on Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, extracting the relevant patient prescription information and converting it into the selected drug representation for our research, the extended-connectivity fingerprint (ECFP). Furthermore, we adopt a unique multimodal approach, developing machine learning models and 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) applied to clinical drug representations, establishing a procedure which has not been used by any previous studies predicting AKI. The findings showcase a notable improvement in AKI prediction through the integration of drug embeddings and other patient cohort features. By using drug features represented as ECFP molecular fingerprints along with common cohort features such as demographics and lab test values, we achieved a considerable improvement in model performance for the AKI prediction task over the baseline model which does not include the drug representations as features, indicating that our distinct approach enhances existing baseline techniques and highlights the relevance of drug data in predicting AKI in the ICU setting."
SMSPROTECT: An Automatic Smishing Detection Mobile Application,2023,['Data securitySmishingSpam SMS detectionRule based learningMobile application development'],,"Short Messaging Service (SMS) has grown to become the most widely used feature in mobile devices. The technological advancements that birthed other alternative messaging applications have not been able to phase out the use of the SMS. However, hackers have been exploiting this SMS feature to perpetrate smishing acts. Existing research has focused on how spam SMS could be detected and separated from ham messages but have not really done much at preventing the act of smishing. Therefore, this research presents a mobile application that used a rule-based SMS service to detect and prevent smishing attacks. Specifically, the developed SMS service allows the developed SMS mobile application to intercept incoming SMS to a smartphone. The intercepted messages were then forwarded through an Application Programming Interface (API) to the rule-based machine learning model. The model uses the carefully selected rules to analyze the retrieved message and asserts if it is a spam or ham. The result of the analysis is then forwarded to the mobile application through the API. However, the final decision to retain or discard the spam or ham depends on the user after receiving notification from the user."

Accurate prediction of flowering timing is crucial for effective forest ecosystem management. This study uses a process-based model to predict flowering timing in 2023 for five major tree species in Korean forests. Models are developed based on nine years (2009-2017) of flowering data for Abeliophyllum distichum, Robinia pseudoacacia, Rhododendron schlippenbachii, Rhododendron yedoense f. poukhanense, and Sorbus commixta, distributed acro ss 28 regions in the country, including mountains. Weather data from the Automatic Mountain Meteorology Observation System (AMOS) and the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) are utilized as inputs for the models. The Single Triangle Degree Days (STDD) and Growing Degree Days (GDD) models, known for their superior performance, are employed to predict flowering dates. Daily temperature readings at a 1 km spatial re solution are obtained by merg ing AMOS and KMA data. To impro ve prediction accuracy nationwide, random forest machine learning is used to generate region-specific correction coefficients. Applying these coefficients results in minimal prediction errors, particularly for Abeliophyllum distichum, Robinia pseudoacacia, and Rhododendron schlippenbachii, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 1.2, 0.6, and 1.2 days, respectively. Model performance is evaluated using ten random sampling tests per species, selecting the model with the highest R2. The models with applied correction coefficients achieve R2 values ranging from 0.07 to 0.7, except for Sorbus commixta, and exhibit a final explanatory power of 0.75-0.9. This study provides valuable insights into seasonal changes in plant phenology, aiding in identifying honey harvesting seasons affected by abnormal weather conditions, such as those of Robinia pseudoacacia. Detailed information on flowering timing for various plant species and regions enhances understanding of the climate-plant phenology relationship."

In this paper, we propose a novel model called SRPAttention-GAN. This model transforms low-quality rebar images into high-resolution images and trains the YOLOv5 model to enhance detection performance. Experimental results confirmed that the PSNR of the SRPAttention-GAN model was approximately 0.3db higher than the existing SRResNet-GAN model. Furthermore, by training YOLOv5 on both the original images and the images generated by the proposed model, we were able to obtain improved results on the F1 and Precision, thereby enhancing the accuracy of rebar endpoint detection."
A modified binary version of aphid–ant mutualism for feature selection: a COVID-19 case study,2023,"['binary aphid–ant mutualism', 'feature selection', 'classification', 'wrapper-based method', 'COVID-19 dataset']",,"The speedy development of intelligent technologies and gadgets has led to a drastic increment of dimensions within the datasets in recent years. Dimension reduction algorithms, such as feature selection methods, are crucial to resolving this obstacle. Currently, metaheuristic algorithms have been extensively used in feature selection tasks due to their acceptable computational cost and performance. In this article, a binary-modified version of aphid–ant mutualism (AAM) called binary aphid–ant mutualism (BAAM) is introduced to solve the feature selection problems. Like AAM, in BAAM, the intensification and diversification mechanisms are modeled via the intercommunication of aphids with other colonies’ members, including aphids and ants. However, unlike AAM, the number of colonies’ members can change in each iteration based on the attraction power of their leaders. Moreover, the second- and third-best individuals can take the place of the ringleader and lead the pioneer colony. Also, to maintain the population diversity, prevent premature convergence, and facilitate information sharing between individuals of colonies including aphids and ants, a random cross-over operator is utilized in BAAM. The proposed BAAM is compared with five other feature selection algorithms using several evaluation metrics. Twelve medical and nine non-medical benchmark datasets with different numbers of features, instances, and classes from the University of California, Irvine and Arizona State University repositories are considered for all the experiments. Moreover, a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) dataset is used to validate the effectiveness of the BAAM in real-world applications. Based on the acquired outcomes, the proposed BAAM outperformed other comparative methods in terms of classification accuracy using various classifiers, including K nearest neighbor, kernel-based extreme learning machine, and multi-class support vector machine, choosing the most informative features, the best and mean fitness values and convergence speed in most cases. As an instance, in the COVID-19 dataset, BAAM achieved 96.53% average accuracy and selected the most informative feature subset."

Recently evolving are machine learning models based on big data for effective production planning. As a representative case of LVHV make-to-order production, we analyze Company A, a domestic small enterprise that produces and delivers various tube products.

In this study, we focus on the phenomenon of shifting from designer-centered logo design creation methods to AI logo maker platforms. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to discuss the characteristics of the creative process of logo makers and the changed design environment based on artificial intelligence technology. To this end, this study examines the theoretical background through a review of the concept of AI, types of creative work and cases, and the development and status of AI technology. Through case studies, this study examines the process and characteristics of AI logo maker platforms. These platforms use rule-based processes that generate results automatically based on user input conditions and options, using an expert system. The process involves four steps: users input information and select options, generate initial logos, customize logos using logo maker tools, and generate final logos and application design. The AI logo maker platform enhances or augments design through AI technology, and streamlines the logo design process through a logo maker tool and a structured process. The platform uses machine learning and deep learning technology, allowing even non-professionals to easily create logos and design results at a low cost within a short period of time. However, there are issues such as overlooking the importance of brand strategy, semantic ambiguity and lack of relevance in the logo, and issues with similar shapes and non-discriminatory results in the logo creation process of AI logo maker platforms."

However, among the contents provided by virtual humans, there may be things that do not infringe copyrights as unique creations and things that do not infringe copyrights. In particular, the possibility of copyright infringement exists in a situation where a large number of materials are being used to train artificial intelligence without special restrictions, except for materials related to personal information. So, this thesis, after examining the meaning of virtual humans, looked into the attribution of rights to creations by virtual humans, the possibility of copyright infringement by virtual humans, and who is responsible for copyright infringement.First of all, currently the data provided by virtual humans are mainly provided by humans, so if they meet the definition of copyrighted work, they can be copyrighted works, and if copyright infringement is established, the provider is responsible for the copyright infringement. However, virtual humans based on artificial intelligence at a low level provide creations as results by algorithms provided by humans, and virtual humans equipped with artificial intelligence using high-level machine learning such as deep learning can provide creations themselves. Both creations may be subject to copyright infringement as various materials are used, so a problem of copyright infringement may occur.In principle, since virtual humans based on artificial intelligence are not human beings, the data created by them do not constitute copyrighted works under the Copyright Act, so copyright infringement does not arise. However, if copyrighted works are used in the process, it may lead to copyright infringement. And if the virtual human only did the work of simply collecting and combining data by the algorithm provided by the developer, the result could be established as a copyrighted work, and the developer could become the copyright holder for it. However, in the process of using the data by artificial intelligence, copyright infringement on other people's works may occur. In addition, even if a virtual human imitates or knits an existing work without human help, it can infringe on the copyright of others in the same way.And, the criminal law recognizes only natural persons with criminal capacity and  it is a person and a corporation that can be the subject of rights or tort capacity under civil law. In addition, since virtual humans are not human beings, those cannot be employees, so creations by virtual humans does not constitute a business work. Furthermore, for the same reason those cannot be the principal offender of copyright infringement, so abet of their owners cannot be established either. However, if the provision of content by virtual humans, such as virtual influencers, is viewed as a service, direct infringement liability of the service provider may arise in case that the service provider directly provides creations that infringe copyright through virtual humans and liability as an online service provider may arise to those who provide artificial intelligence services in case artificial intelligence provides creations that infringe on the copyrighted works of others according to the instructions of virtual human users. In addition, there is a problem with the owner's liability for torts under the civil law for the infringement of virtual humans. Regarding this issue, it may be possible to create new provisions similar to the liability provisions of animal possessors or to hold tort liability under section 760."

One of these issues is the question of responsibility. Who should be held responsible for harmful outcomes resulting from the actions of intelligent autonomous robots? Since no one has direct control over specific actions of these robots, it seems inappropriate to attribute their actions to humans. This situation is referred to as the ‘responsibility gap.’ This paper introduces the background of the emergence of the responsibility gap and explores various ways to address it. Responses to the issue of the responsibility gap can be broadly categorized into two types. One type does not consider the responsibility gap a substantial problem, while the other acknowledges it and seeks ways to address it. This paper will particularly focus on discussions that recognize the existence of the responsibility gap. Many researchers participating in this discussion have given the impression of too easily acknowledging the existence of the responsibility gap. I wanted to delve into the issue more deeply from a fundamental perspective, so I critically examine the causal argument and the cognitive argument, which are the core arguments supporting the recognition of the responsibility gap, and present my perspective on the reasons why many researchers argue for the existence of the responsibility gap."
Reinforced quantum-behaved particle swarm-optimized neural network for cross-sectional distortion prediction of novel variable-diameter-die-formed metal bent tubes,2023,"['metal bent tube', 'variable diameter die', 'cross-sectional distortion', 'quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization', 'back-propagation neural network']",,"With light weight, high strength, and high performance, metal bent tubes have attracted increasing applications in aeronautics. However, the growing demand for customized tubular parts has led to a significant increase in the cost of conventional tube-bending processes, as they can only process tubes of a specific diameter. To this end, this paper proposes a variable diameter die (VDD) scheme which can bend tubes with a specific range of diameters. To investigate the formability of VDD-processed tubes for practical VDD applications, an accurate and reliable prediction method of cross-sectional distortion is imperative. Hence, we pioneer a novel intelligent model based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO)-optimized back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to predict a rational cross-sectional distortion characterization index: average distortion rate. The adaptive adjustment of coefficients and the Gaussian distributed random vector are introduced to QPSO, which balance the search and enhance the diversity of the population, respectively. For further improvement in optimization performance, the informed initialization strategy is applied to QPSO. The efficiency of the proposed reinforced QPSO (RQPSO)-optimized BPNN model is evaluated by comparing the results with those of the BPNN, BPNN with Xavier initialization, several different particle swarm optimization variants-optimized BPNN models, and variants of popular machine learning models. The results indicated the superiority of RQPSO over other methods in terms of the coefficient of determination (${R}^2$), variance account for, root mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error, and standard deviation of MSE. Thus, the proposed novel algorithm could be employed as a reliable and accurate technique to predict the cross-sectional distortion of VDD-processed tubes."

AEL is a formal logic developed by R. C. Moore that is used for knowledge representation and reasoning. This logical system goes beyond traditional propositional logic to provide a more dynamic and reflective approach, including not only facts but also gaps in knowledge and imperfections in beliefs.At its core, AEL is based on self-reference and non-monotonic logic. Moore explores two key elements of non-monotonic logic: archetypes and beliefs, and defines auto-referential reasoning as a subset of common sense reasoning. AEL is particularly important in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), where it contributes to the ability to reason flexibly in different scenarios and situations. For example, it can be used in medical diagnostic systems to make a diagnosis based on a patient's symptoms and medical history, or in environmental monitoring to assess air pollution levels.The purpose of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the concept of AEL, its theoretical foundations, and its importance in the fields of AI and logic. The thesis explores the theoretical structure and methodology of AEL and evaluates its applications in AI systems. In doing so, it demonstrates how AEL can be utilized to address the challenges of knowledge representation and reasoning, and in a variety of applications.The thesis also addresses the challenges and limitations faced by AEL. These include computational complexity, integration issues with other AI techniques, and research gaps in its application in real-world scenarios. AEL's abstract formalism, reliance on idealized rationality, and limitations in handling contradictory information are also important considerations.Future directions include exploiting the research potential of AEL to develop self-aware AI models, integrating it with machine learning and data-driven approaches, and developing ethical AI. This is expected to contribute to enhancing the self-referential and reasoning capabilities of AI systems and enable more adaptive and intelligent decision-making.This paper explores the theoretical foundations of AEL and its potential applications in the field of AI, and provides an analysis of its current limitations and future development directions. It aims to highlight the importance and potential of AEL in the field of AI and computational logic, while providing a roadmap for further research and development in this area."

Tunneling technique is developed as an open source and is used as a tool to safely connect from the outside to the inside like a VPN. But it is also used for malicious attacks by malware. Statistical techniques or machine learning were studied as methods to counter such malicious tunneling, mainly using packet content or size information. However, if the channel is encrypted or the header size is kept constant, the detection effect will be reduced. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of DNS, HTTP, ICMP, and VoIP tunneling techniques for malicious purposes. We propose detection elements and methods that can complement existing detection methods. In particular, we examine the header characteristics and possible abuse of the network services available in tunneling. These research results will be able to contribute to the development of modules that detect or block malicious tunneling."

We would like to explore various analytical examples and issues used in the field of sports game analysis and propose data mining, an analysis methodology with high convergence interaction with future innovative technologies based on modern data science. Traditional analysis methods in the past overlooked the influence of independent factors that occur between specific performance factors and a number of factors.In particular, research results derived from the combination of economic factors through interaction between economic factors were limited. However, in the case of data mining analysis methods, regular data generated in various phenomena and situations are combined to increase the utilization and accessibility of analysis, and the purity inherent in the data is derived as a result to infer meaningful results compared to traditional statistical techniques. The use of data mining analysis methods in the field of sports competition analysis can infer and predict the results of various diversified and multifaceted phenomena in the sports field in three dimensions, and is very popular in using analysis results. In addition, the field applicability of research results for research purposes is secured, and the efficiency of practical values is high, so advanced behavioral pattern analysis will be possible through existing numerical analysis. Finally, the use of data mining from the perspective of sports game analysis (image analysis, data analysis, media analysis) will be able to upgrade sports data analysis in conjunction with big data analysis such as predictive analysis, machine learning, streaming analysis, and cluster analysis in the database."

In addition to utilizing temperature data typically employed in existing condensation prevention methods, the Steam Sensor was incorporated to monitor the continuous and discontinuous condensation behavior. This allowed for the collection of fundamental data for real-world condensation prediction and prevention. Before conducting the experiment, the heat flow rate for windows exposed to outdoor air using ISO-9869 was measured and validated. Indoor temperature and humidity were controlled through Arduino programming based on open-source platforms to observe the distribution of these factors. Subsequently, condensation was artificially induced by manipulating temperature and humidity conditions, then measured it with the Steam Sensor. During the experiment, as the indoor temperature was raised, absolute humidity and dew point temperature increased, resulting in an increase in the measured Steam Sensor values. When indoor humidity levels rise and the humidifier operates for an extended period, the accumulation of water vapor within the room increases. This elevated moisture level was detected by the Steam Sensor, and the condensation persisted until the end of the measurement. The experimental data gathered in this study will be valuable for future research where the aim is to develop a condensation prediction algorithm through machine learning techniques."

Unlike the market’s positive response at the time of disclosure of stock repurchase based on the undervalued hypothesis, an empirical analysis was conducted on how the market response changes when managerial overconfidence makes a disclosure of stock repurchase. The results of the study are as follows. The market response to the disclosure of stock repurchases was found to positively support the undervalued hypothesis. The higher the manager’s overconfidence, the lower the short-term response at the time of disclosure, the higher the long-term response after disclosure. There are the negative relation between manager’s overconfidence and CAR(-5,+5) and positive relation with BHAR for 12 and 24 months after disclosure.These results showed that the market underestimated the manager’s overconfidence and mis-valuated the disclosure of stock repurchases, but in the long run, the value of overconfidence did not decline or disappear, meaning that the manager does not send false signals or mis-valuate the value of stock repurchases. This study analyzed the manager’s overconfidence measured by textual analysis using BERT, one of the machine learning methods, and compared it with the manager’s overconfidence variable measured by financial information to increase credibility of the overconfidence variable."

Again, because artificial intelligence algorithms go beyond replacing human hands and feet and are replacing the brain, their impact cannot be simply compared to the changes brought about by the industrial revolution in the past. I consider the change essential and revolutionary. In order to properly see the impact of artificial intelligence, which is causing innovative changes in our lives and the structure of society, we must understand the nature of the scientific and technological development that supports the development of artificial intelligence. We must also examine what implications the development of science and technology, including artificial intelligence, has on the legal system and jurisprudence.In this article, I first introduced naturalism that emerged in the development of natural science. Naturalism takes the view that the human mind is not separate from the physical and chemical processes of the brain. There is strong criticism of the old dichotomy between mind and body. Then, the hypothesis arises that the mechanical action of artificial intelligence will not be qualitatively different from the human mental action. It is also possible to predict that, unlike the brain, which has limited capacity, the invention of machines that can greatly expand the units and levels that play the role of neurons and synapses will lead to the emergence of artificial intelligence that surpasses the capabilities of the human brain.With the development of natural science, some social sciences, such as psychology, economics, or even law, are being challenged or transformed. However, it was explained that even within the scientific community, there are various opinions regarding the nature and function of science and the significance of scientific discoveries. So, natural science alone is not yet at the stage where it can explain human activities or all phenomena in the natural world. And even if natural science becomes highly advanced and the reality of the mind, life, or material phenomena we know is revealed one after another, there will still be work for jurisprudence to do. Since law is a natural study, it must go beyond simply describing natural phenomena and propose ways to organize society, maintain communities, and establish relationships between people based on that foundation. However, as seen in the development of science and artificial intelligence technology, our society is not static and is changing busily every day. Facts we once knew as stereotypes are changing with scientific discoveries. It can be said that it is the job of legal scholars to learn more about the progress of new science and the formation of world views and universe views and to construct an orderly and contradiction-free legal system based on this."

Hearing loss and auditory challenges are unique to each individual, and patient outcomes can be significantly enhanced by tailoring rehabilitation programs to their specific needs. In this section, we discuss some critical components of a personalized approach to auditory rehabilitation. A comprehensive assessment is the first step in conducting a thorough evaluation of an individual's hearing and auditory processing abilities. This involves conventional audiometric testing, speech perception assessments, and specialized tests to identify the specific areas of difficulty. Based on the assessment results, it is necessary to establish clear and achievable goals with the individual and involve their family or caregivers. These goals should be tailored to the person's needs, preferences, and lifestyle, considering their communication demands.Personalized treatment plans should be developed that specifically address the areas of concern identified during the assessment. This may involve hearing aids, cochlear implants, bone conduction devices, personal sound amplification products, assistive listening devices, auditory training exercises, and/or speech therapy. Technological tools should be utilized tools to support auditory rehabilitation efforts. This could include apps, computer programs, or online platforms that offer personalized training exercises, hearing aid adjustments, or teleradiology services.

To integrate the thematic layers for GPM, the criteria werefirst weighted using the Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) and then overlaid using the Technique for OrderingPreferences by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model. Finally, the groundwater potential was categorized into fiveclasses (very high (VH), high (H), moderate (M), low (L), very low (VL)) and verified by examining the specific capacityof individual wells on each class. The wells in the area categorized as VH showed the highest median specific capacity(5.2 m3/day/m), while the wells with specific capacity < 1.39 m3/day/m were distributed in the areas categorized as L orVL. The accuracy of GPM generated in the work looked acceptable, although the specific capacity data were not enoughto verify GPM in the studied large watershed. To create GPMs for the determination of high-yield well locations, theresolution and reliability of thematic maps should be improved. Criterion values for groundwater potential should beestablished when machine learning or statistical models are used in the GPM evaluation process."

This is because the current Korean Capital Markets Act is silent on algorithmic trading regulation, and although the Korea Exchange regulates algorithmic trading with its own regulations, there are significant restrictions. Therefore, this article reviews recommended revisions to the current Korean Capital Markets Act in order to effectively regulate and sanction algorithmic trading, especially high-frequency algorithmic trading, which can have a great impact on the market order, mainly by referring to EU laws.In addition, the standards for calculating criminal fines and/or administrative penalties for violations of Articles 176, 178, and 178-2 of the Capital Markets Act, which prohibit market price manipulation, etc., need to be greatly revised. Since these provisions prohibiting market manipulation are intended to ensure fairness in stock trading and smooth distribution, the amount of profits obtained by violators should not be a key factor in determining the statutory penalties.In addition, as algorithmic trading by autonomous AI using machine learning becomes common, proper regulation will be difficult with conventional market price manipulation regulations that depend on intention, purpose, and causation. However, it is not clear whether the bills pending in the Korean National Assembly to regulate AI will be helpful in protecting users in terms of regulating market manipulation by AI involved algorithmic trading. In this case, further discussions on liability attribution and sharing of damages should be conducted and appropriately reflected in the AI regulatory legislation."

Instead of modifying a pre-trained model like ResNet 50, which has been proven to perform well, we instead directly implement an image recognition model to perform species classification, which showed an accuracy of 85%, and then determined the features derived from the recognition process. To understand the impact of image size and growth on classification, we evaluated performance of the model through image size and image growth. The performance improvement was about 3% for image size and 6.4% for image growth. We also compare its performance with a machine learning model based on data labeling.

The way we communicate and maintain relationships online used to be a trend of the younger generation, but now it is becoming more common across generations. As influencers over the age of 50 who actively express themselves through SNS continue to communicate actively (Korea Consumer Resources, 2016), and even senior “SNS stars” have emerged and attracted public attention, the use of SNS by seniors is still in a growing trend (Kim, Yongchul, 2019). This study was motivated by the need to break away from the stereotype that SNS is exclusively for young people and expand the category of main users to the age group of 50+.This study aimed to examine the SNS usage behavior of seniors in detail and explore the factors that affect their usage through the following research questions. Specifically, we found the SNS usage patterns of senior SNS users and verified the effects of psychological variables (need for cognition, self-esteem) and household composition (single-person households, married households, and two- and three-generation households) on the active use of SNS.RQ 1. How are seniors divided into user groups based on their SNS usage behavior and what are the characteristics of each group? RQ 2. How do psychological factors (need for cognition, self-esteem) influence social media use among seniors? RQ 3-1. How does household composition affect active SNS use among seniors? RQ 3-2. Which factor is relatively more important for seniors to become active SNS users, considering both psychological factors and household composition? The study population is 4,249 senior respondents aged 50 and older from the 2019 and 2020 Media Panel Data provided by the Korea Information Society Development Institute(KIDSI). The R 4.1.3 statistical package was used to analyze the data in this study. First, we used the K-means algorithm, one of the clustering analysis methods using machine learning, to cluster senior users according to their SNS usage behavior in <RQ 1>. For <RQ 2> and <RQ 3-1 and 3-2>, a logistic regression analysis was conducted with psychological factors and household composition as independent variables and whether or not a person belongs to a group whose SNS use changed from passive to active in 2020 compared to 2019 as the dependent variable.First, we tried clustering according to SNS usage behavior and found three groups: ‘active users’, ‘passive users’, and ‘non-users’. Next, we looked at the movement between cohorts in 2019 and 2020 to explore which variables influenced which cohorts moved to active social media use, and found that being in a two- or three-generation household was most likely to lead to active social media use. Furthermore, when we reanalyzed the 'New Senior' and 'Old Senior' groups based on the age of 65, we found that the higher the need for cognition of the Old Senior group and the more likely they were to belong to a second-generation household, the more likely they were to be part of a group that had moved to an active level of social media use.Previous research on social media use by seniors has tended to treat them as a homogeneous group of passive social media users. This is because seniors are less likely to use media and less likely to use social media than other generations. However, since this study focused only on seniors over 50, we were able to draw new conclusions about the existence of active SNS users among seniors. We also tried to categorize users by considering the extent to which they use various SNS features, rather than just quantitative measures such as having an SNS account or spending time on it. We found that seniors who actively use SNS are more likely to express themselves on SNS. These results suggest that there is a group of seniors who use various functions of SNS and that we need to move away from the ..."

After performing morphological analysis of the word definitions, the research went through a data refinement process. Through this process, this study derived a correlation coefficient among the entries using 3,519 word definition elements acquired through this process. Based on the degree of similarity between entries, this study developed a recommendation method. Then conducted an analysis by comparing the ‘related vocabulary’ presented in ‘Urimalsam’ with the recommended vocabulary generated by this method. For the experiment, the study randomly selected two cases from the entire field of philosophy where ‘Urimalsam’ had ‘related vocabulary’ and two cases where it d id not. Then the study analyzed the recommendation results. This method was predominantly recommending the related words provided in ‘Urimalsam’’s ‘related vocabulary.’ Furthermore, a significant number of entries that were deemed highly relevant to the entries and were not listed in ‘Urimalsam’ were also appearing prominently in the top ranks. Through this, the study anticipated that this research technique would contribute to reducing the number of manual steps required for selecting related words. However, it was apparent that the specific nuances of relevance were not indicated, and in cases where the word definitions were subtle, there might be a need for additional manual review, as sometimes less relevant entries were also recommended. To overcome these limitations, the study proposed the following approaches: the continuous updating of ‘Urimalsam,’ simultaneous utilization of other specialized dictionaries, utilizing various metadata elements, machine learning, and attempting the use of TF-IDF within the word definitions."

In particular, we focus on the tendency of young adults in their 20s, who have been highlighted as a new political force, to be consumed by gender-based political conflicts, and capture how the media limited the complex agenda attributes of the 'Men and Women in their 20s' agenda to gender-conflicting issues in the 20s. First, we conducted topic modeling on 3,431 relevant news articles to identify agenda attributes, and extracted detailed topics of the 'Men and Women in their 20s' agenda and clustered them based on policy-social agenda attributes and male-female agenda attributes. Most of the extracted topics were related to the campaigns of political candidates in the 20th presidential election, confirming the consumption of 'Men and Women in their 20s' in a political context. Next, we analyzed the composition of gender frames in the coverage of the 'Men and Women in their 20s' agenda through an automated text classification algorithm. We, then, examined the effect of agenda attributes on three gender frames: gender issue analysis frame, gender representation frame, and gender conflict frame, and found that among the agenda attributes of 'Men and Women in their 20s', the female-policy agenda attribute 'female quota system', the male-social agenda attribute 'man-hating controversy', and the male-policy agenda attribute 'soldier meals' had a significant positive effect on the use of gender conflict frame. Moreover, at the agenda attribute level, only the female-policy attribute was positively correlated with the gender conflict frame, unlike other agenda attributes, suggesting that women-oriented policy issues tend to be limited to social conflict and controversy. On the other hand, when it comes to the relationship between agenda attributes and gender representation frame, we found that the 'Men in their 20s' are represented as a group attacking feminism and a far-right populist image, while the 'Women in their 20s' are represented as a socially vulnerable group such as victims of crime and a group opposing discrimination against women. We also found that the new media reported male-policy agenda attributes, such as the 'soldier meals' topic, or female-policy agenda attributes, such as the 'female quota system' topic, in a gender-conflicted manner, turning the issue into a kind of gender confrontation by associating election promises for young people with a specific gender. The theoretical contribution of this study is that it examined the relationship between news agendas and gender-related frames based on attribute agenda-setting theory and frame theory, and explored a research method that combines topic modeling and supervised machine learning at the research methodological level."
An Integrated EMVO and ARBFN Algorithms for Output Power Forecasting and Fault Prediction in Solar PV Systems,2023,"['Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems', 'Maximum peak point tracking (MPPT)', 'Endowed multi-verse optimization (EMVO)', 'Augmented radial basis functional network (ARBFN)', 'Fault detection', 'Power forecasting']",,"Predicting the output power and detecting the faults on the solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are the challenging tasks in the modern decades. The conventional works are highly focused on developing an optimization and classification methodologies for accomplishing PV output power forecasting and fault prediction separately. But, this paper focused on solving a multi-objective research problem by implementing an innovative optimization and classification methodologies. For obtaining the maximum power yield from the solar PV panels, the maximum peak point tracking controlling technique is used in this system. In the first stage of work, the PV output power prediction is performed by deploying an endowed multi-verse optimization (EMVO) methodology. This technique intends to improve the convergence rate of optimization by estimating the best fitness value. For computing the best fitness value, the nonlinear inertial weight has been estimated with respect to the distance near the optimal universe. Also, the selection operation is performed to obtain the survival of the fittest value based on the crossover probability and random dimension value. Based on this, the power prediction can be performed with the operations of crossover, mutation and selection. In the second stage of work, the fault detection is mainly concentrated to ensure the normal operations on the PV system. For this purpose, an augmented radial basis functional network (ARBFN) technique is implemented for exact fault detection. In the proposed work, the EMVO and ARBFN methodologies are mainly used for accomplishing the objectives of PV output power forecasting and fault prediction at earlier stage. Here, the set of wavelet patterns have been extracted and used for training the classifier, which improves the overall accuracy rate of fault classification. Moreover, the experimental results evaluate the performance of both power prediction and fault detection techniques by using various measures. By using the proposed EMVO–ARBFN mechanisms, the absolute error value is reduced up to 0.2%, relative error is reduced to 3%, accuracy of prediction is increased to 98%, and fault mis-classification rate is minimized to 2.5%. Also, the obtained results have been compared with the existing approaches for proving the superiority of the proposed system, which includes the pre-turn method, back propagated neural network, artificial neural network, support vector machine, support vector regression, and other integrated machine learning models."

In this study, in identifying the growth model, the analysis was conducted using the generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) and the piecewise growth model (PGM) in longitudinal study. For empirical data, GAMM and PGM were used for identifying changes in students' academic achievement in mathematics through the Korean Education Longitudinal Study (KELS-2013) data. As a result, the exponent of the growth model function optimized in GAMM was calculated as 2.98, confirming that the growth model was most suitable for a cubic function. In addition, as a result of verifying the random effect by applying GAMM, a growth of 198.73 points was confirmed in the first year, the starting point of the survey, and it was confirmed that female students showed 2.97 points higher growth than male students in terms of growth in students' math achievement. On the other hand, as a result of applying PGM, the turning point appeared at 2.54, and it was confirmed that the greatest change was shown at the time of school grade change from elementary school to middle school. Such results as in this study show different approaches through GAMM and PGM to explore data-based growth models, and these results can be greatly expanded to analyze growth models such as data-based machine learning methods."

While the ‘Guiding Principles affirmed by the Group of Governmental Experts on Emerging Technologies in the Area of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems’ was adopted by the 2019 Meeting of High Contracting Parties to the CCW, it does not appear that the so-called ‘responsibility gap’ has been filled up. In May 2023, 14 countries including Argentina submitted ‘Draft Protocol on Autonomous Weapon Systems (Protocol VI)’ which completely bans autonomous weapon systems, but this draft does not contain any provision for verification. The scope of military use of artificial intelligence has already extended beyond that of autonomous weapon systems, and it appears that an artificial intelligence arms race has begun to gain military superiority. If this arms race continues, the risk of unintended consequences such as ‘flash war’ will increase, whether due to machine learning vulnerabilities such as ‘adversarial examples’ or other factors including interactions between relevant systems. Since it is difficult or impossible to detect the presence or verify the absence of military artificial intelligence systems with current technology, it would be difficult or impossible to resolve this risk by completely banning military uses of artificial intelligence. A realistic way to reduce this risk will probably be a partial and verifiable restriction, not a complete ban that cannot be verified. On July 18, 2023, ‘artificial intelligence: opportunities and risks for international peace and security’ was placed on the agenda of the UN Security Council for the first time, and at the meeting of the Council the UN Secretary-General said that he would call on Member States to engage in a multilateral process to develop norms, rules and principles around military applications of artificial intelligence. The issue of military use of artificial intelligence will be discussed in the Security Council as well as the multilateral process mentioned by the Secretary-General, and thus diplomatic factors will become one of the important variables that will determine the outcome of the discussion."

However, as much as its influence, many concerns are raised. In particular, as cases have been reported that decisions made by artificial intelligence are gender discriminatory, efforts are being made to improve them. This paper aims to study what ways to improve the gender bias of artificial intelligence in terms of law. Korea has regulated artificial intelligence in a way that stipulates necessary matters in each individual law. However, considering the enormous influence of artificial intelligence, it is necessary to enact and regulate basic laws, not through individual laws. The Framework Act on Artificial Intelligence should stipulate anti-discrimination provisions. Only when stipulated can the prohibition of Gender discrimination be defined with the values and principles that artificial intelligence must protect. The bias of artificial intelligence is caused by gender-biased data collection or algorithms that produce gender-discriminatory results. Since a person in charge of verifying and correcting this is needed, it should be stipulated in the Basic Law. It is difficult to check data or algorithms used for machine learning of artificial intelligence from the outside. Therefore, it is necessary to specify in the Basic Law that artificial intelligence developers should conduct an ""artificial intelligence impact assessment"" internally. The Framework Act on Artificial Intelligence should specify the prohibition of discrimination, the designation of a person in charge of preventing bias, and the disposition of fines that can be imposed if the impact assessment is not implemented, so that it can be effectively regulated."

Helpful reviews, perceived by customers, have been verified in various research studies to be influenced by factors such as ratings, review length, review content, and so on. The determination of a review’s helpfulness is generally based on the number of ‘helpful’ votes from consumers, with more ‘helpful’ votes considered to have a more significant impact on consumers’ purchasing decisions. However, recently written reviews that have not been exposed to many customers may have relatively few ‘helpful’ votes and may lack ‘helpful’ votes altogether due to a lack of participation. Therefore, rather than relying on the number of ‘helpful’ votes to assess the helpfulness of reviews, we aim to classify them based on review content. In addition, the text of the review emerges as the most influential factor in review helpfulness. This study employs text mining techniques, including topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to analyze the diverse impacts of content and emotions embedded in the review text. In this study, we propose a review helpfulness prediction model based on review content, utilizing movie reviews from IMDb, a global movie information site. We construct a review helpfulness prediction model by using an explainable Graph Neural Network (GNN), while addressing the interpretability limitations of the machine learning model. The explainable graph neural network is expected to provide more reliable information about helpful or non-helpful reviews as it can identify connections between reviews."

Japanese students' admiration for Western culture and their will to enlighten themselves about the reality of Joseon were the 'acceptance of Western culture' that came through Japan. In addition, as part of the patriotic enlightenment movement, ‘science’ was promoted, inventions and discoveries were encouraged, and historical stories and biographies of heroes were included to inspire patriotism. However, the group of students living in Japan who actively accepted Western culture as part of the patriotic enlightenment movement formed an intellectual class during the colonial period and unexpectedly aligned themselves with the domestic nationalist line.This paper examines how translations of science fiction, which came as part of patriotic enlightenment in 1907 and 1908, influenced subsequent domestic novels. While studying abroad in Japan, Lee Kwang-soo also wrote articles for a magazine for international students in Japan, creating novels that fully capture the sentiment of the magazine and the characteristics of the student group. Lee Gwang-su's life allows us to learn what activities a group of Japanese students studying abroad did after returning to Joseon and what the scientific inventions they believed in meant to them. Rather than Lee Kwang-soo's perception of science, this paper examines the history of how 'invention science' was introduced and accepted as a heterogeneous and contradictory landscape by Joseon people during the colonial period, including inventions and discovered materials as news items depicted in his works, and chemical experiments perceived as landscapes. I want to go see it.In addition, it was judged that a group of Japanese students studying abroad played a leading role in creating inventions, discovered materials and landscapes, and how it was perceived from The Strange Story of an Undersea Travel published in a magazine for Japanese students studying abroad to the novels of Lee Kwang-soo, who had the experience of studying abroad in Japan. I went there. Therefore, rather than Lee Kwang-soo's personal awareness of science, we consider Kim Seong-jae revealed in The Pioneer as a representative symbol of a colonial student, and try to follow the characters in the work. The reason why the term ‘invention/discovery’ was used instead of ‘science’ was because the focus was on the machines, technologies, or landscapes of inventions/ discoveries rather than scientific awareness. Even though they borrow materials from inventions and discoveries, Lee Gwang-soo's The Pioneer and Love cannot be classified as ‘science fiction’ because they do not directly use the term ‘science’.In this paper, we will examine why the actions of characters in novels about 'inventions and discoveries' are full of contradictions, and why 'science', which was introduced as part of the patriotic enlightenment movement and national prosperity and military power, did not lead to the enrichment of the nation. do. The characteristics of the group of Japanese students who were the first to introduce science or industry (science and engineering) and science fiction clash with the life they lived after returning to Joseon, and the inventions and discoveries that have no substance and the inventions and discoveries that do not succeed and always repeat failure. I want to show this through their experiments in the novel. I would like to follow The Strange Story of an Undersea Travel and The Iron World, which were first introduced into Korea, and the domestic original novels The Pioneer and Love by Lee Kwang-su, which were influenced by these works."

Artificial intelligence's decision based on big data increases the efficiency of work processing by quickly reviewing a large amount of data and reducing time and cost. As a result, artificial intelligence technology has begun to be used in all areas of society, and it is expected to be an anti-corruption policy tool against hiring-related corruption and irregularities that raise doubts about trust and process. However, if there is no proper control over artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence can rather strengthen prejudice and infringe on job seekers' personal information. This is because the data based on artificial intelligence's decisions have been accumulated for a long time, so discrimination and prejudice against race, gender, or certain groups in the past can be revealed or reflected in algorithm design. Moreover, since artificial intelligence's decision-making process is difficult to present procedures and grounds that can be generally understood through self-learning, there is a situation in which humans have to accept machine decisions as they are in a difficult state to refute or correct. Therefore, while maximizing the utility of high-tech technology, it is necessary to find a way to use artificial intelligence without damaging human dignity and value.As a way to guarantee the personal rights of artificial intelligence's decision-making, the exclusive decision of artificial intelligence should be limited by referring to the European Personal Information Protection Regulations and the final decision authority should be placed on humans. In addition, it is necessary to set guidelines based on careful analysis by audit agencies, the government, ethics committees, and psychological experts for legal and ethical problems that arise in the hiring process using artificial intelligence. It is more urgent to prepare effective specific procedures to prevent and monitor the risks of technology. As the hiring process is the first step in getting a job, which is a means of self-realization, evaluation according to equality of opportunities and job competency is important. We hope that practical and balanced clear laws will be created through intense discussions by legal, philosophical and technical experts. The most important proposition is that artificial intelligence is a tool that helps humans make decisions, and its ethics always depend on the person who makes the tool."
