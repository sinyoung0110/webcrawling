Image Classification Algorithm Based on Proposal Region Clustering Learning-Unsupervised Deep Learning,2023,"['Proposal cluster learning', 'Unsupervised learning', 'Multiple instance learning', 'Deep learning', 'Image classification']",,"Although deep learning has achieved certain results in image classification, images are susceptible to factors such as lighting conditions, shooting angles, complex backgrounds, rotation transformations or scale scaling, and image data sets in some areas are difficult to obtain. They make the deep learning framework unable to give full play to its generalization ability and nonlinear modeling ability in image classification. Therefore, this paper first proposes a proposal region clustering learning algorithm, which clusters the proposal regions in each image so that each cluster corresponds to the category of the image. Then, different clusters can be regarded as different multi-instance learning packets, and each packet uses the multi-instance learning method to learn the unsupervised image classification detector. It can effectively improve the generalization and modeling capabilities of deep learning models. In addition, this paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning method, which designs an unsupervised deep learning network structure and loss function according to the characteristics of the classified image, and combines densely connected blocks to extract features from the source image. It retains the multi-scale features of the middle layer of the classified image, and effectively solves the problem of insufficient image feature extraction information caused by the lack of image data. It also guarantees the accuracy of subsequent image classification. The experimental results show that the image classification method proposed in this paper not only solves the problem of insufficient image data sets and the interference of various complex factors, but also can accurately classify various image data sets. The accuracy of the image classification method proposed in this paper is 1.38–19% higher than other mainstream deep learning methods."
Proposal of a new method for learning of diesel generator sounds and detecting abnormal sounds using an unsupervised deep learning algorithm,2023,"['Unsupervised deep learning algorithm', 'Diesel generator sounds', 'Detecting abnormal sounds', 'Diagnosing the fault']",,"This study is to find a method to learn engine sound after the start-up of a diesel generator installed in nuclear power plant with an unsupervised deep learning algorithm (CNN autoencoder) and a new method to predict the failure of a diesel generator using it. In order to learn the sound of a diesel generator with a deep learning algorithm, sound data recorded before and after the start-up of two diesel generators was used. The sound data of 20 min and 2 h were cut into 7 s, and the split sound was converted into a spectrogram image. 1200 and 7200 spectrogram images were created from sound data of 20 min and 2 h, respectively. Using two different deep learning algorithms (CNN autoencoder and binary classification), it was investigated whether the diesel generator post-start sounds were learned as normal. It was possible to accurately determine the post-start sounds as normal and the pre-start sounds as abnormal. It was also confirmed that the deep learning algorithm could detect the virtual abnormal sounds created by mixing the unusual sounds with the post-start sounds. This study showed that the unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm has a good accuracy increased about 3% with comparing to the binary classification algorithm."

Plain radiography was used to examine the severity and treatment of this phenomenon. To avoid examiner subjectivity in radiography readings, we propose an automatic segmentation method to identify fluid-filled areas indicative of large bowel obstruction. Our proposed method applies the Hough transform to locate suspicious areas successfully and applies the possibilistic fuzzy c-means unsupervised learning algorithm to form the target area in a noisy environment.

Additionally, the proposed method shows a true-positive rate of over 91% and false-positive rate of less than 3% for pixel-level area formation. These performance evaluation statistics are significantly better than those of the possibilistic c-means and fuzzy c-means-based strategies; thus, this hybrid strategy of automatic segmentation of large bowel suspicious areas is successful and might be feasible for real-world use."

However, such images lack 3D spatial information aboutthe scene, which is very useful for scientists, surveyors, engineers, and even robots. To tackle such problems,depth maps are generated for respective image planes. Depth maps or depth images are single image metric whichcarries the information in three-dimensional axes, i.e., xyz coordinates, where z is the object’s distance from cameraaxes.

Artifact disentanglement network (ADN) supports an unsupervised learning approach, in which no paired CBCT images are required. The network consists of an encoder that separates artifacts and content and a decoder for the content. Additionally, ADN with data normalization replaces metal regions with values from bone or soft tissue regions. Finally, the metal regions obtained from the CBHE are blended into reconstructed images.The proposed approach is systematically assessed using a dental phantom with two types of metal objects for qualitative and quantitative comparisons.Results: The proposed hybrid scheme provides improved image quality in areas surrounding the metal while preserving native structures.Conclusion: This study may significantly improve the detection of areas of interest in many dentomaxillofacial applications."

Subsequently, unsupervised and supervised machine learning were applied to develop a dissolution prediction model. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was conducted to evaluate the similarity between the datasets generated by the DoE. In addition, supervised learning, such as partial least squares (PLS) regression with variable importance in projection (VIP), was conducted, and a prediction model was developed using an artificial neural network (ANN) as a machine learning model. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA), which is an unsupervised learning method, was used to preprocess the ANN model to reduce the number of features.Results HCA divided the data set obtained by DoE into three clusters, and it was confirmed that the L/S ratio significantly affected granule and tablet properties. The ANN, PLS-VIP(0.8)-ANN, PLS-VIP(1.0)-ANN, and PCA-ANN models were developed and statistically compared. The PLS-VIP(0.8)-ANN accurately predicted the dissolution profile with a high coefficient of determination and low mean absolute deviation, root mean square error, and sum of squared errors.Conclusion This paper describes the application of various machine learning algorithms to predict drug product quality as a control strategy of continuous manufacturing."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Classification of Imbalanced Time Series Data,2023,"['Adversarial Learning', 'Pseudo-Label', 'Time Series Classification', 'Unsupervised Domain Adaptation']",,"This study proposes a three-step domain adaptation method to address the diminished performance observed in the time series data classification. This decline stems from (i) dissimilarities in data distribution between the source and target domains and (ii) the absence of labeled data in the target domain. The efficacy of the proposed method is substantiated through its application to a tailored human activity recognition (HAR) dataset. Our approach commenced by training the time series classification models employing adversarial backpropagation. Subsequently, a pseudo-labeling technique was applied to the unlabeled target domain data. This technique generated pseudo-labels through an ensemble voting scheme using the domain-adapted classification models. Finally, a specially chosen domain-adapted model underwent fine-tuning, incorporating both the labeled source and pseudo-labeled target domain data. The outcomes of our study indicate that integrating domain adaptation with adversarial learning and pseudo-labeling yields a notable enhancement in performance in the target domain."
Deep Learning Approach for Automatic Discontinuity Mapping on  3D Model of Tunnel Face,2023,"['3D Tunnel face', 'Rock discontinuity', 'Deep learning', '3차원 터널 막장', '암반 불연속면 분류', '딥러닝 영역분할']",,"This paper presents a new approach for the automatic mapping of discontinuities in a tunnel face based on its 3D digital model reconstructed by LiDAR scan or photogrammetry tech- niques. The main idea revolves around the identification of discontinuity areas in the 3D digital model of a tunnel face by segmenting its 2D projected images using a deep-learning semantic segmentation model called U-Net. The proposed deep learning model integrates various features including the projected RGB image, depth map image, and local surface properties-based images i.e., normal vector and curvature images to effectively segment areas of discontinuity in the images. Subsequently, the segmentation results are projected back onto the 3D model using depth maps and projection matrices to obtain an accurate repre- sentation of the location and extent of discontinuities within the 3D space. The performance of the segmentation model is evaluated by comparing the segmented results with their corresponding ground truths, which demonstrates the high accuracy of segmentation results with the intersection-over-union metric of approximately 0.8. Despite still being limited in training data, this method exhibits promising potential to address the limitations of conven- tional approaches, which only rely on normal vectors and unsupervised machine learning algorithms for grouping points in the 3D model into distinct sets of discontinuities."

Sustainable Smart City Building-energy Management Based on Reinforcement Learning and Sales of ESS Power,2023,"['AI', 'Big Data', 'Building-energy Management', 'Energy Storage System', 'Reinforcement Learning', 'Renewable Energy', 'Smart City']",,"In South Korea, there have been many studies on efficient building-energy management using renewable energy facilities in single zero-energy houses or buildings. However, such management was limited due to spatial and economic problems. To realize a smart zero-energy city, studying efficient energy integration for the entire city, not just for a single house or building, is necessary. Therefore, this study was conducted in the eco-friendly energy town of Chungbuk Innovation City. Chungbuk successfully realized energy independence by converging new and renewable energy facilities for the first time in South Korea. This study analyzes energy data collected from public buildings in that town every minute for a year. We propose a smart city building-energy management model based on the results that combine various renewable energy sources with grid power. Supervised learning can determine when it is best to sell surplus electricity, or unsupervised learning can be used if there is a particular pattern or rule for energy use. However, it is more appropriate to use reinforcement learning to maximize rewards in an environment with numerous variables that change every moment. Therefore, we propose a power distribution algorithm based on reinforcement learning that considers the sales of Energy Storage System power from surplus renewable energy. Finally, we confirm through economic analysis that a 10% saving is possible from this efficiency."

To address these issues, this article develops a hybrid modeling pipeline combining unsupervised and supervised learning to predict the level of hazardous road sites and explore the causality of accidents by controlling unobserved heterogeneity issues effectively. Traffic accident data for Won-ju province, Korea, from 2020 to 2021, and external factors affecting traffic accidents, such as average travel speed and weather information, are combined based on road links. Through the modeling pipeline, a clustering technique is adopted to capture unobserved heterogeneous information among roads.

To explore the relationship between the accident and determinant factors, are adopted to interpret the results of machine learning models. Model-agnostic methods, however, generally provide results based on images, this study also added a process that extracts texts from images to overcome compatible issues with existing road safety management systems."
Wind turbine maximum power point tracking control based on unsupervised neural networks,2023,"['wind turbine', 'MPPT', 'radial basis function neural network', 'direct speed control']",,"The main control goal of a wind turbine (WT) is to produce the maximum energy in any operating region. When the wind speed is under its rated value, the control must aim at tracking the maximum power point of the best power curve for a specific WT. This is challenging due to the non-linear characteristics of the system and the environmental disturbances it is subjected to. Direct speed control (DSC) is one of the main techniques applied to address this problem. In this strategy, it is necessary to design a speed controller to adjust the generator torque so to follow the optimum generator speed. In this work, we improve the DSC by implementing this speed controller with a radial basis function neural network (NN). An unsupervised learning algorithm is designed to tune the weights of the NN so it learns the control law that minimizes the generator speed error. With this proposed unsupervised neural control methodology, the electromagnetic torque that allows the optimal power extraction is obtained, and thus the best power coefficient (${C}_\mathrm{p}$) values. The proposal is tested on the OpenFAST non-linear model of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 1.5 MW WT. Simulation results prove the good performance of this neuro-control approach as it maintains the WT variables into the appropriate range and tracks the rated operation values. It has been compared with the controller included in OpenFAST giving up to 7.87% more power."

Then, the evolution stages were divided by using unsupervised clustering method. Finally, the remaining useful life (RUL) was predicted based on particle filter (PF). Three different groups of whole life cycle data of rolling bearings under various working conditions were used to prove the feasibility of the indicator. The results show that the wavelet-CNN features of completely different fault data show similar evolution trends, and the normalization of warning threshold can be realized based on the train labels.

Fault diagnosis of rolling bearings using unsupervised dynamic time warping-aided artificial immune system,2023,"['Novelty detection', 'AIS', 'DTW', 'bearing fault', 'vibrations.']",,"Rotating machines heavily rely on an intricate network of interconnected sub-components, with bearing failures accounting for a substantial proportion (40$\%$ to 90$\%$) of all such failures. To address this issue, intelligent algorithms have been developed to evaluate vibrational signals and accurately detect faults, thereby reducing the reliance on expert knowledge and lowering maintenance costs. Within the field of machine learning, Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) have exhibited notable potential, with applications ranging from malware detection in computer systems to fault detection in bearings, which is the primary focus of this study.

Therefore, research on anomaly detection methods using data learning-based artificial intelligence technology is increasing. In addition, supervised learning-based anomaly detection methods are difficult to use in real environments because they require sufficient labeled data for learning. Research on an unsupervised learning-based method that learns from normal data and detects an anomaly by finding a pattern in the data itself has been actively conducted. Therefore, this study aims to extract a latent vector that preserves useful sequence information from sequence log data and develop an anomaly detection learning model using the extracted latent vector. Word2Vec was used to create a dense vector representation corresponding to the characteristics of each sequence, and an unsupervised autoencoder was developed to extract latent vectors from sequence data expressed as dense vectors. The developed autoencoder model is a recurrent neural network GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) based denoising autoencoder suitable for sequence data, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network-based autoencoder to solve the limited short-term memory problem that GRU can have, and an autoencoder combining GRU and one-dimensional convolution was used. The data used in the experiment is time-series-based NGIDS (Next Generation IDS Dataset) data, and as a result of the experiment, an autoencoder that combines GRU and one-dimensional convolution is better than a model using a GRU-based autoencoder or a one-dimensional convolution-based autoencoder. It was efficient in terms of learning time for extracting useful latent patterns from training data, and showed stable performance with smaller fluctuations in anomaly detection performance."

Therefore, the current study proposed detection methodbased on unsupervised as well as supervised learning. An attempt was made to increase reliability and accuracy usingMobileBERT to tokenize URL strings and convert them into embedding vectors that take lexical features into account. Theembedding vector was dimensionally reduced using PCA and autoencoder and then inputted into XGBoost and LOF to evaluateperformance. In the case of supervised learning, higher performance was achieved when the dimension of the embedding vector was reduced using PCA rather than an autoencoder, and malicious URLs could be detected with a high probability just by usingvectors embedded through mobileBert without dimensionality reduction. In the case of unsupervised learning, overall recall was higher than precision, and increasing the number of samples of normal data improved detection performance."

For this reason, oral health has become a key component of public health, from infants to the elderly. The foundation of good oral health is good brushing habits. However, the recommended correct brushing method is not easy to adopt, and this harms oral health. This paper proposes a method to distinguish brushing zones using low-cost IMU sensors to track the correct brushing method. We evaluated the accuracy of the brushing zone estimation method using clustering algorithms in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a method for determining the brushing area based on toothbrush posture alone using the gyro sensor of an IMU sensor. In this paper, we propose a method for determining the brushing area using only the gyro sensor of an IMU sensor based on toothbrush posture. We showed that relatively inexpensive 6-axis IMU gyro sensor data could be used to estimate the user’s brushing area with an accuracy of 80.6%. In addition, we applied a clustering algorithm to these data and trained a logistic regression model using the clustered data to estimate the brushing area. The result was obtained with an accuracy of 86.7%, showing that clustering was effective and that the toothbrush posture-based brushing area estimation proposed in this paper was effective. In conclusion, it is expected that the brushing zone estimation algorithm can be implemented as a function of a relatively low-cost toothbrush and that it can help to maintain oral health by analyzing and improving personal brushing habits."

First, as a result of conducting K-Means Clustering, a representative unsupervised learning among machine learning techniques, eight regional clusters of terrorism occurred around the world in 2021 (near Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Iraq, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Somalia). Next, as a result of clustering by type of terrorism, assassination using weapons excluding explosives, kidnapping or kidnapping targeting key facilities were identified. In addition, as a result of clustering around the means used in terrorism, it was confirmed that there were many explosives ahead, but there were differences according to the cluster. Finally, clusters of military, police, government personnel, civilians, and private property were identified as a result of clustering centered on targets of terrorism.

A typical encoder-decoder model, such as an autoencoder, transforms the encoder input into a latent vector and feeds it into the decoder. In this process, the encoder-decoder model learns to produce an decoder output similar to the encoder input. We can consider that the latent vector of the encoder-decoder model is well preserved by abstracting the characteristics of the encoder input. Further, it is possible to apply to unsupervised learning, if the latent vector guarantees a sufficient distance between clusters in the feature space. In this paper, the classification performance of latent vectors is analyzed as a basic study for applying latent vectors in encoder-decoder models to unsupervised and continual learning. The latent vectors obtained by the stacked autoencoder and 2 types of CNN-based autoencoder are applied to 4 kinds of classifiers including KNN and random forest. Experimental results show that the latent vector using the CNN-based autoencoder with a dense layer (about 97%) shows superior classification performance by up to 2% compared to the result of the stacked autoencoder (about 95%). Based on the results in this paper, it is possible to extend the latent vector obtained by using a CNN-based auto-encoder with dense layer to unsupervised learning."

This model is based on semi supervised deep belief networks (SDBN). DBN is known for obtaining higher classification of accuracy but is majorly unsupervised learning-based model. In SDBN, supervised information is embedded into DBN learning process making the learning to be semi-supervised in a way. As compared to other popular models improved classification accuracy under noisy conditions is obtained along with less processing time for PQ classification.

In previous studies, it was difficult to use because a large amount of labeling data was required for model learning. The purpose of this study is to improve the performance of artificial intelligence models by organizing learning and test datasets without bias and testing them by cluster without manual classification or labeling. Two experiments were conducted on the artificial intelligence model DC-VTON of the virtual try-on and the results were compared. First, the test set was divided into five clusters each using two clustering methods and the model was tested. In the two methods, the deviation of the model quality indicator SSIM values of the clusters was compared. The deviation of convolutional neural network-based clustering was 0.022 larger than that of pixel value-based clustering, resulting in more differences in performance by cluster. Second, two experiments were conducted to add re-learning data for each cluster to reach the target value of the model's quality performance index. Comparing the SSIM average of clusters that had low performance with after re-learning, the differential addition method by cluster increased by 3.2% and the equal addition method by cluster increased by 0.64%. In clusters with low quality, complementing the learning data resulted in improved performance improvement. Based on the results of these studies, it is expected that the quality of image-based artificial intelligence models can be improved by clustering images, which are unstructured data, according to characteristics, to refine test sets and enhance cluster-specific test results."

Second, zero type semantics and the volition of a subject are relevant factors. The middle construction is restricted by the zero type semantics, but the demotional passive is not. In addition, the use of middle constructions consciously or unconsciously involves a semantically implied agent, while this occurs only consciously in the case of demotional passives. Third, in middle constructions, movement of a viewpoint and objectification of self are accompanied, but not in demotional passives. Fourth, middle constructions share the social foundation with the subject and the perceiver, but demotional passives do not. Fifth, middle constructions and demotional passives are symmetric in that they are acquired through episodic memory together, but they are asymmetric in that middle constructions are acquired by observer memory and demotional passives by field memory and semantic memory.

Surrogate Model Based on Data-Driven Model Reduction for Inelastic Behavior of Composite Microstructure,2023,"['Data-driven', 'Model order reduction', 'Inelasticity', 'Surrogate model', 'Deep learning']",,"On the microscale, most composite materials are composed of heterogeneous materials comprising two or more different phases, such as matrices and inclusions. In addition, composite materials may exhibit high variability, depending on the material and amount of material used. Hence, the effect of microstructure on the macroscopic structural analysis of composite materials must be considered. Computational homogenization can be used to describe an effective constitutive model for heterogeneous composites at the microscopic level. However, a significant computational cost may be incurred owing to the iterative procedure when considering the inelastic behavior of composite materials. Hence, an efficient data-driven model reduction technique, i.e., a deep-learned surrogate model, is proposed. The key idea of the proposed framework is twofold: (1) Data-driven unsupervised model reduction for efficiently managing high-dimensional data from the microstructure and for extracting those features, and (2) the construction of parameterized constitutive models with inelastic behavior by connecting macro- and microscopic levels. Each aspect leverages a variational autoencoder and a gated recurrent unit, which are state-of-the-art components for deep learning. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model, the proposed model is applied to a two-dimensional microstructure problem involving inelastic behavior. Consequently, it is discovered that the present surrogate model can provide improved computational efficiency and accuracy within a prescribed parametric space."

Currently, situation judgement using POI and GPS data is mainly rule-based. However, this approach has the limitation that inferences can only be made using predefined POI information. In this study, we propose an algorithm that uses POI data, GPS data, and schedule information to calculate the current speed, location, schedule matching, movement trajectory, and POI coverage, and uses machine learning to determine whether to stay or go. Based on the input data, the clustered information is labelled by k-means algorithm as unsupervised learning. This result is trained as the input vector of the SVM model to calculate the probability of moving and staying. Therefore, in this study, we implemented an algorithm that can adjust the schedule using the travel schedule, POI data, and GPS information. The results show that the algorithm does not rely on predefined information, but can make judgements using GPS data and POI data in real time, which is more flexible and reliable than traditional rule-based approaches. Therefore, this study can optimize tourism scheduling. Therefore, the stay detection algorithm using GPS movement trajectories and POIs developed in this study provides important information for tourism schedule planning and is expected to provide much value for tourism services."

To overcome this, the Ministry of National Defense has emphasized the importance of management of the total life cycle system through Defense Reform 2020, and a project is being promoted to apply big-data-based state-based maintenance (CBM) in all areas of defense work. However, due to security regulations and the operation of analog facilities, data collection and use are limited, and it is difficult to apply big-data-based CBM. This research shows a case of constructing an abnormal detection model of an air dryer to prevent radar failure using the operation data of facilities that are not sufficiently secured due to the restrictions mentioned. An abnormal detection method is proposed for a weapon system under conditions with insufficient operation data and failure history. After acquiring normal operational data from six military units, an anomaly detection model was made using various anomaly detection techniques from unsupervised learning, and an optimal model was selected. In addition, an optimal threshold and alarm criteria were selected to decrease the false alarm rate in normal conditions for each unit and to detect abnormalities as quickly as possible. The results of this study confirmed the possibility of applying anomaly detection through AI application to another weapon system and laid the foundation of securing empirical cases, CBM models using AI, and data analysis techniques with actual operation data."

Conventionally, leaks have been detected using various signal processing techniques such as autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions. However, these approaches encounter a challenge when noise is present in the collected data, as the intensity of the leak signal is weakened, making it difficult to accurately identify low-level leaks. In addition, since it is difficult to collect actual leak state data, this paper implements unsupervised learning models using autoencoder-based six different structures and proposes two leak detection approaches using them.

Unfortunately, it is often challenging to assess inflammation in NAFLD due to its dynamic nature and poor correlation with liver biochemical markers. Liver histology keeps its role as the standard tool, yet it is well-known for substantial sampling, intraobserver, and interobserver variability. Serum proinflammatory cytokines and apoptotic markers, namely cytokeratin-18, are well-studied with reasonable accuracy, whereas serum metabolomics and lipidomics have been adopted in some commercially available diagnostic models. Ultrasound and computed tomography imaging techniques are attractive due to their wide availability; yet their accuracies may not be comparable with magnetic resonance imaging-based tools. Machine learning and deep learning models, be they supervised or unsupervised learning, are promising tools to identify various subtypes of NAFLD, including those with dominating liver inflammation, contributing to sustainable care pathways for NAFLD."

However, SAR images are difficult to interpret because there are no color information and not easy to distinguish objects. In order to solve this problem, studies for colorizing SAR images using deep learning techniques have recently been conducted. CycleGAN, which has been used in conventional unsupervised learning, is not suitable for SAR images with geometric distortion due to its limited geometric transformation because of its cyclic structure. In addition, the PatchGAN discriminator, widely used in image translation models, is unsuitable for satellite images with complex shape changes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model that applies a SPatchGAN discriminator that discriminates images through statistical features of images based on the CUT that has advantages in geometric transformation. For performance comparison with existing models, the models were trained for the SpaceNet, a public dataset, and then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Experimental results showed that the proposed model improved performance subjectively and objectively, compared to existing models."

Using artificial intelligence to detect human errors in nuclear power plants: A case in operation and maintenance,2023,"['human error detection', 'anomaly detection', 'nuclear power plants', 'machine learning']",,"Human error (HE) is an important concern in safety-critical systems such as nuclear power plants (NPPs).HE has played a role in many accidents and outage incidents in NPPs. Despite the increased automation in NPPs, HE remains unavoidable. Hence, the need for HE detection is as important as HE prevention efforts. In NPPs, HE is rather rare. Hence, anomaly detection, a widely used machine learning technique for detecting rare anomalous instances, can be repurposed to detect potential HE. In this study, we develop an unsupervised anomaly detection technique based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to detect anomalies in manually collected surveillance data in NPPs. More specifically, our GAN is trained to detect mismatches between automatically recorded sensor data and manually collected surveillance data, and hence, identify anomalous instances that can be attributed to HE. We test our GAN on both a real-world dataset and an external dataset obtained from a testbed, and we benchmark our results against state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, including one-class support vector machine and isolation forest. Our results show that the proposed GAN provides improved anomaly detection performance. Our study is promising for the future development of artificial intelligence based HE detection systems."

In this study, evaluation indicators that can evaluate the natural and human environments were derived, and the distribution patterns for each indicator were analyzed. Afterwards, by applying Self-Organizing Map (SOM) analysis, one of the unsupervised learning analysis methods, districts with similar characteristics were derived in Taeanhaean National Park, and the characteristics of each district were analyzed. As a result of the study, 7 districts with different characteristics were derived in Taeanhaean National Park, and by examining the contribution of each indicator together, it was possible to reveal that each district had different representative characteristics even though it was an adjacent area. This study evaluated natural parks by comprehensively considering the indicators of the natural and human environments. In addition, the SOM method used in the study is meaningful in that it can provide scientific and objective grounds for the existing zoning and apply it to the management plan."

However, DNNs pose two major problems. First, neural networks require large amounts of well-labeled data for training. Second, the covariate shift problem is common in computer vision problems. Domain adaptation has been proposed to mitigate this problem. Recent work on adversarial-learning-based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has explained transferability and enabled the model to learn robust features. Despite this advantage, current methods do not guarantee the distinguishability of the latent space unless they consider class-aware information of the target domain. Furthermore, source and target examples alone cannot efficiently extract domain-invariant features from the encoded spaces. To alleviate the problems of existing UDA methods, we propose the mixup regularization in adversarial discriminative domain adaptation (ADDA) method. We validated the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method by performing experiments under three adaptation scenarios: MNIST to USPS, SVHN to MNIST, and MNIST to MNIST-M."

However, topic modeling's usage in media research has recently come under fire for failing to take into account reliable and valid measures of theoretically defined concepts. This means that topic modeling needs methodological validation and reliability in order to be employed in media research as a tool for investigating and summarizing massive volumes of textual material. Additionally, it is helpful to be able to group online comments into ""issues"" and list their important points in order to quickly identify social issues and monitor discourse patterns in real-time on digital platforms. For this reason, attempts to diagnose the methodological validity of topic modeling for analyzing the topics of comments are of great significance. Therefore, this study validates topic modeling for analyzing online comments by verifying its performance as follows. First, we discussed why topic analysis of comments is necessary and what the implications are through the conceptualization of ""issues"" in the context of online comments. Then, with an emphasis on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, we reviewed the principle of topic modeling to estimate the topic of text and the assumptions of statistical models that affect topic estimation. Additionally, we contrasted the merits and drawbacks of LDA and the Biterm Topic Model (BTM) to suggest topic modeling as a means of identifying the subject of comments and categorizing them as ""issues."" Based on the above theoretical discussion, we applied topic modeling to analyze 9,000 online news comments on articles covering nine social issues and validate whether the topics are useful to classify comments according to the ""issues"" of the news. The results are as follows. First, compared to BTM, LDA is highly dependent on the hyperparameter, , with lower values leading to better model performance. Second, both BTM and LDA were able to estimate the optimal number of topics (K ), but BTM showed less variation in performance with value selection than LDA, and performance degradation was worse when the value was lower than the optimal K than when it was higher. Third, both BTM and LDA performed better when adding bigrams along with unigrams to the vocabulary, but the difference was more pronounced for LDA. Based on these validation results, we assessed the validity of topic modeling for analysis of comments and discussed its implications."

We will improve the convenience of use by reflecting the user’s various Extended Reality experiences in the development of interactive Extended Reality.As a research method, Chapter 2 analyzes the representative artificial intelligence art works worth mentioning in relation to the optimization of Extended Reality, and Chapter 3 considers the optimization of artificial intelligence art and Extended Reality in three ways. First, the optimization between the user and the artificial intelligence program is analyzed, and the interaction optimization between the user and the artificial intelligence program is studied.

"Black-box Medicine with AI/ML Technology Regulation: Clinical Roles, Relations, and Risks",2023,"['Artificial intelligence', 'black box', 'medicine', 'FDA', 'KFDA', '인공지능', '블랙박스', '의약품', 'FDA', '식약청']",,"This study discusses the issues with black-box medicine, including the challenges or barriers to fostering trust in artificial intelligence systems for their eventual integration, use, and adoption in medical settings. It also explores potential medical liabilities such as legal and ethical issues, which are novel and unresolved in terms of potential errors or harms caused by artificial intelligence diagnoses or treatment recommendations. Finally, these subjects also necessitate a brief examination of changing physician roles, in that black-box algorithms will eventually affect the relationships between patient and physicians when artificial intelligence becomes capable of simulating, assisting, or replacing traditionally human physician tasks. Technological advances in the form of black-box medicine as well as artificial intelligence generally and machine learning continue to affect regulatory frameworks and perceived risks. Regarding the implementation of these tools in medical devices, there is a need for greater clarity to ensure safety for patients while also being responsive to claims of efficacy or utility. Specifically, increasing the explanatory power of these technologies in the course of medical artificial intelligence development also furthers these twin goals. Technology usage for general scientific applications like drug discovery further highlights the potentially pervasive effects of black-box medicine on overall human health. At the same, separate issues arise concerning broader artificial intelligence safety and related areas such as bias far beyond mere medical outcomes. These uncertainties are by no means easily resolved, and they require the careful deliberation of interdisciplinary analysis drawing from legal, medical, and other expert backgrounds. In particular, it is necessary for lawmakers and regulators to be knowledgeable about the clinical impact of these tools as well as their impact on standard industry norms for policy goals . While the rapid development of new artificial intelligence models continues to improve human health, there are ongoing risks involved with regard to the way that decisions are made. Although unsupervised learning from artificial intelligence in medicine presents an opportunity, safety and other issues may mitigate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based studies by clinicians in the absence of additional protections. Reassuring patients as well as clinicians about artificial intelligence safety is imperative and promotes debate about the necessity of supporting or replacing clinical judgment in a healthcare context. This tension between human users and the new models as utilized in treatment underscores the idea that these technologies have the potential to either supplant human skills or augment them, depending on the needs of the medical setting. United States and Korean regulations also suggest that at the level of algorithms in black-box medicine, additional scrutiny may be warranted. Concerns about the opaqueness or black-box nature of an algorithm itself also give rise to calls for interpretability and developer awareness. Rapid product improvement with effective safeguards and pre-market approval prompt additional areas of analysis as medicine and other areas of science strive to balance the goal of enhancing medicine with the underlying nature of black-box medicine as algorithms which may not be capable of perfect transparency. In summary, black-box medicine suggests a new challenge in medicine which also begets opportunities. However, it also calls for detailed supervision in policy and practice with sound methodologies both to assure its ethical deployment and to foster trust towards innovative medical technologies."

However, there are relatively few companies that actively utilize collected data, academic research using field data is actively underway. This study seeks to develop a model that detects anomalies in the process by analyzing spindle power data from a company that processes shafts used in automobile throttle valves.Since the data collected during machining processing is time series data, the model was developed through unsupervised learning by applying the Holt Winters technique and various deep learning algorithms such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiRNN, BiLSTM, and BiGRU. To evaluate each model, the difference between predicted and actual values was compared using MSE and RMSE. The BiLSTM model showed the optimal results based on RMSE. In order to diagnose abnormalities in the developed model, the critical point was set using statistical techniques in consultation with experts in the field and verified. By collecting and preprocessing real-world data and developing a model, this study serves as a case study of utilizing time-series data in small and medium-sized enterprises."

Various cluster analysis techniques have been proposed, and the k-means clustering method, which minimizes the sum of Euclidean distances between cluster centroids and individual entities, is widely recognized as a standard cluster analysis method. When data include missing values, it is challenging to conduct cluster analysis, because it is impossible to calculate distances between centroids of clusters and incomplete items, resulting in excluding classification of these items. Techniques have been suggested to handle missing values in k-means clustering, including conducting cluster analysis after imputation of missing values or cluster analysis based on available information. In this study, we explore methods to perform k-means cluster analysis on data with missing values and evaluate performance of these methods using a simulation. The results of simulation studies indicate that conducting k-means cluster analysis after imputation yields the better performance than the one based on available information. Among the various imputation methods, k-nearest neighbors imputation performed the best."
SNS 데이터 기반 신어 추출 및 용례 분석,2023,"['Neologism', 'Dependency Parser', 'Usage Analysis', 'new words', 'Noun Extractor', 'Morphological Analysis', 'Neologism Usage Examples']",,"Recently, the amount of newly coined words generated in Korean is vast, and the frequency of use in official language media such as the media, broadcasting, and books as well as everyday spoken language is gradually increasing. As the time spent in the Internet space increases, language for communication is created in various forms or its meaning changes to convey new information or values to members of society. In this study, the SNS corpus containing the rapidly changing use of language was analyzed. After selecting new word candidates by constructing a series of pipelines for extracting noun-type new words from the SNS corpus, characteristics and usage were analyzed. At this time, in the natural language processing pipeline that extracts new words, a pipeline including all the processes of rule-based learning using Mecab, unsupervised learning using Soynlp, and user dictionary addition using a correct morpheme analyzer was constructed to extract meaningful tokens. After completing the step of selecting new word candidates, 255 new words were collected. The proportion of sentences including the new word candidate group in the SNS data was 4.799%. Among them, the proportion of sentences in which words belonging to the top 10 appeared was 12.345%. Looking at the ratio of classifying the top 30 new words according to the word formation method, the word formation method that occupied the highest ratio was compound word-synthetic abbreviations (33.3%). The type/token ratio of sentence data including new words was 0.324. The type/token ratio of SNS data was 0.254. Since the type/token ratio of SNS data is lower, it can be said that ototoxicity is higher than that of sentences containing new words. When looking at the collocation relationship and usage of new words such as the initial constant word 'ㄹㅇ', the borrowed word '-특', and the meaning-expanded word '코인', various forms and syntactic uses could be found, and there were many collocations that reflected the social image at the time of data collection. Judging from this phenomenon, the characteristics of corpus, in which initials, borrowings, meeaning-expandings, and special characters are used among newly coined words, become incomplete when simply relying on a dictionary consisting of words or word lists, so a natural language processing dataset containing more diverse social meanings can be constructed by using usage data."

However, the performance of anomaly detection algorithms is generally evaluated on publicly available datasets, and the specific performance of each algorithm on anomalies of particular types remains unexplored. Consequently, selecting an appropriate anomaly detection algorithm for specific analytical contexts poses challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to investigate the types of anomalies and various attributes of data. Subsequently, we intend to propose approaches that can assist in the selection of appropriate anomaly detection algorithms based on this understanding. Specifically, this study compares the performance of anomaly detection algorithms for four types of anomalies: local, global, contextual, and clustered anomalies. Through further analysis, the impact of label availability, data quantity, and dimensionality on algorithm performance is examined. Experimental results demonstrate that the most effective algorithm varies depending on the type of anomaly, and certain algorithms exhibit stable performance even in the absence of anomaly-specific information. Furthermore, in some types of anomalies, the performance of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms was observed to be lower than that of supervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. Lastly, we found that the performance of most algorithms is more strongly influenced by the type of anomalies when the data quantity is relatively scarce or abundant. Additionally, in cases of higher dimensionality, it was noted that excellent performance was exhibited in detecting local and global anomalies, while lower performance was observed for clustered anomaly types."
한국어 일반 명사의 기능적 분포와 분류,2023,"['n-gram', 'PCA (principal component analysis)', 'clustering', 'PPMI(positive pointwise mutual information)', 'distributionalism', 'common nouns']",,"This paper attempts to classify Korean common nouns based on the distributional hypothesis. In the Korean PoS (part-of-speech) system, common nouns are no longer being classified separately. However, this research demonstrates that the usage patterns of common nouns can still be distinguished into several types, despite the lack of formal classification. To achieve the classification of Korean common nouns, a 2-gram vocabulary set was created from the Korean lexical semantic corpus. From this set, items containing common nouns were processed separately to construct the analytical data for this research. The 'common nouns (1566) x 2-gram items (531)' table containing frequencies was subjected to Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) clustering. The results confirmed that Korean common nouns can be divided into five or more categories based on this analysis. The significance of this research lies in demonstrating the ability to classify common Korean nouns based on n-gram distributions only using unsupervised learning methods."
