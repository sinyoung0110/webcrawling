In this study, we propose an image registration methodology that aligns coordinates between ""VHR (Very High-Resolution) satellite"" images using extracted conjugate points by a self supervised deep learning network. MagicPoint detector is built using a synthetic shape dataset to learn overall characteristics of feature points. The MagicPoint detector is advanced using feature points extracted from various VHR remote sensing open-source datasets. Pseudo-label is generated in the VHR satellite imagery by the advanced MagicPoint detector. At this time, homographic adaptation is applied to consider the various geometric environments. SuperPoint is built using the VHR satellite imagery and the pseudo-label. The image registration is conducted using an estimated non-linear transformation model based on extracted conjugate points through the proposed method. Based on experiments conducted from KOMPSAT-3 imagery acquired over the Daejeon city,the proposed method evenly extracted numerous conjugate points over the overlapping areas, and registration accuracy was measured as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) 1.563 pixels and CE90 (Circular Error 90%) 1.971 pixels. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the proposed method can contribute to the improvement of registration accuracy by extracting the conjugate points reflecting the characteristics of VHR satellite imagery."
Deep Learning-Enabled Detection of Pneumoperitoneum in Supine and Erect Abdominal Radiography: Modeling Using Transfer Learning and Semi-Supervised Learning,2023,"['Abdominal radiography', 'Deep learning', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Pneumoperitoneum', 'Transfer learning', 'Pretraining', 'Knowledge distillation']",,"Objective: Detection of pneumoperitoneum using abdominal radiography, particularly in the supine position, is often challenging. This study aimed to develop and externally validate a deep learning model for the detection of pneumoperitoneum using supine and erect abdominal radiography.Materials and Methods: A model that can utilize “pneumoperitoneum” and “non-pneumoperitoneum” classes was developed through knowledge distillation. To train the proposed model with limited training data and weak labels, it was trained using a recently proposed semi-supervised learning method called distillation for self-supervised and self-train learning (DISTL), which leverages the Vision Transformer. The proposed model was first pre-trained with chest radiographs to utilize common knowledge between modalities, fine-tuned, and self-trained on labeled and unlabeled abdominal radiographs. The proposed model was trained using data from supine and erect abdominal radiographs. In total, 191212 chest radiographs (CheXpert data) were used for pre-training, and 5518 labeled and 16671 unlabeled abdominal radiographs were used for fine-tuning and self-supervised learning, respectively. The proposed model was internally validated on 389 abdominal radiographs and externally validated on 475 and 798 abdominal radiographs from the two institutions. We evaluated the performance in diagnosing pneumoperitoneum using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared it with that of radiologists.Results: In the internal validation, the proposed model had an AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.881, 85.4%, and 73.3% and 0.968, 91.1, and 95.0 for supine and erect positions, respectively. In the external validation at the two institutions, the AUCs were 0.835 and 0.852 for the supine position and 0.909 and 0.944 for the erect position. In the reader study, the readers’ performances improved with the assistance of the proposed model.Conclusion: The proposed model trained with the DISTL method can accurately detect pneumoperitoneum on abdominal radiography in both the supine and erect positions."
Supervised pre-training for improved stability in deep reinforcement learning,2023,"['Deep reinforcement learning', 'Pre-training', 'Supervised learning', 'Maximum entropy', 'Stability']",,"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology has been actively studied with the recent advances in deep learning. As a result, the researchers are continuously improving performance and expanding the applications. However, recent literature reports that the performance of DRL is sensitive to the various design choices, e.g., the neural network initialization. Accordingly, it makes DRL hard to obtain a stable performance, which degrades reproducibility. Therefore, we propose a supervised pre-training method for both policy and value networks to improve stability. We pre-train the policy network to maximize the initial entropy and pre-train the value network to bias the distribution to a specific value. The experiments are conducted on tasks with discrete action space where it is hard to control the initial entropy. Through the experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of stability and performance is validated."

Energy-efficient semi-supervised learning framework for subchannel allocation in non-orthogonal multiple access systems,2023,"['energy efficiency (EE)', 'multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)', 'non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)', 'resource allocation (RA)', 'semi-supervised learning', 'subchannel allocation']",,"Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is considered a key candidate technology for next-generation wireless communication systems due to its high spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. Incorporating the concepts of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) into NOMA can further improve the system efficiency, but the hardware complexity increases. This study develops an energy-efficient (EE) subchannel assignment framework for MIMO-NOMA systems under the quality-of-service and interference constraints. This framework handles an energy-efficient co-training-based semi-supervised learning (EE-CSL) algorithm, which utilizes a small portion of existing labeled data generated by numerical iterative algorithms for training. To improve the learning performance of the proposed EE-CSL, initial assignment is performed by a many-to-one matching (MOM) algorithm. The MOM algorithm helps achieve a low complex solution. Simulation results illustrate that a lower computational complexity of the EE-CSL algorithm helps significantly minimize the energy consumption in a network. Furthermore, the sum rate of NOMA outperforms conventional orthogonal multiple access."
Korean Text to Gloss: Self-Supervised Learning approach,2023,"['Sign Language Production', 'Neural Machine Translation', 'Korean Corpus']",,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) has grown tremendously in recent years. Typically, bilingual, and multilingual translation models have been deployed widely in machine translation and gained vast attention from the research community. On the contrary, few studies have focused on translating between spoken and sign languages, especially non-English languages. Prior works on Sign Language Translation (SLT) have shown that a mid-level sign gloss representation enhances translation performance. Therefore, this study presents a new large-scale Korean sign language dataset, the Museum-Commentary Korean Sign Gloss (MCKSG) dataset, including 3828 pairs of Korean sentences and their corresponding sign glosses used in Museum-Commentary contexts. In addition, we propose a translation framework based on self-supervised learning, where the pretext task is a text-to-text from a Korean sentence to its back-translation versions, then the pre-trained network will be fine-tuned on the MCKSG dataset. Using self-supervised learning help to overcome the drawback of a shortage of sign language data. Through experimental results, our proposed model outperforms a baseline BERT model by 6.22%."

3D Printing Monitoring System Based on Supervised Machine Learning,2023,"['Tensile Strength', 'Overlap Rate', 'Scan Speed', 'Laser Power']",,"One of the additive manufacturing processes that is quickly evolving is metal 3D printing. Selective laser melting (SLM) is one of the popular methods for metal 3D printing. Although it has many advantages and capabilities, there are still unsolved problems like process monitoring and printing reliability. Printing high-quality robust products require appropriate parameter settings and real-time monitoring. In order to satisfy the requirement, we propose a new monitoring system based on multiple sensors that can measure the index of different quality affecting parameters of SLM 3D printing. The system serves to improve printing quality; it involves supervised machine learning to predict the expected tensile strength of the printed product. We trained the machine learning model on our new “tensile strength” dataset which includes multiple sensing data and indexes of tensile strength. While collecting data we printed products that have a tensile strength between 449 and 506 MPa. A number of SLM 3D printing tests are carried out to show the viability of the proposed approach. After testing the tensile strength of the printed product, test results were compared to the results of the tensile strength predicting model. According to experiments, the monitoring system showed satisfactory results predicting expected tensile strength. The highest accuracy has been achieved with Multiple Linear Regression, recording 97%. The monitoring system helps not only to predict the tensile strength of the printing product but also to find optimal parameter settings of the SLM printer."
Supervised learning method for prediction of heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids,2023,['· ANN · FCM · ANFIS · CFD · Nanofluid · Forced convection'],,"This study focuses on the alication and investigation of the predictive ability of artificial intelligence in the numerical modelling of nanofluid flows. Numerical and experimental methods are powerful tools from an accuracy point of view, but they are also time- and costconsuming methods. Therefore, using soft-computing techniques can improve such CFD drawbacks by patterning the CFD data. After obtaining the aropriate ANN and ANFIS architecture using the CFD data, many new data can be created without requiring numerical and experimental methods. In the scope of this research, the FCM-ANFIS and ANN methods are used to predict the thermal behaviour of the turbulent flow in a heated pipe with several nanoparticles. A parametric CFD study is carried out for water-TiO 2 , water-CuO, and waterSiO 2 nanofluid through a pipe. The Reynolds number is varied between 7000 and 15000, and the nanofluid concentration is varied between 0.25 % and 4 %. The effects of using nanofluid on local values of Nusselt number and shear stress distribution were investigated. Numerical results indicate that with the increasing nanoparticle volume fraction of nanofluid, the average Nusselt number increases, but the required pumping power also increases. The obtained soft computing results demonstrate that the FCM clustering ANFIS has given better results both in training and testing when it is compared to the ANN architecture with an R 2 of 0.9983. Regarding this, the FCM-ANFIS is an excellent candidate for calculating the Nusselt number in heat transfer problems."

To do this, methods on augmenting input images were mainly used.However, strong augmentation hinders the stability of reinforcement learning. Thus, by gradually increasing the random image mixing ratio during training, a reinforcement learning agent is not affected by strong data augmentation. At the same time, the effect on generalization performance is maximized. Experiments on DM Control test environments have shown that the proposed method outperforms the existing studies on the generalization of image-based reinforcement learning."

Classification of Power Quality Disturbances Using Semi-supervised Deep Belief Networks,2023,"['Deep belief networks', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'PQD classification']",,"Modern power system has to deal with many power quality related issues due to increasing renewable integration with grid and increasing non-linear power electronics based load on the user side. Power quality disturbances (PQDs) affects the overall performance of power system technically as well as economically. Hence, classification of PQD is important and high classification accuracy is required for the same. In this work deep learning based PQ classifier model is presented. This model is based on semi supervised deep belief networks (SDBN). DBN is known for obtaining higher classification of accuracy but is majorly unsupervised learning-based model. In SDBN, supervised information is embedded into DBN learning process making the learning to be semi-supervised in a way. As compared to other popular models improved classification accuracy under noisy conditions is obtained along with less processing time for PQ classification. The addition of supervised learning layers in DBN helps extract much more relevant and strong features from PQ data."
Semi-Supervised Land Cover Classification of Remote Sensing Imagery Using CycleGAN and EfficientNet,2023,"['CycleGAN', 'EfficientNet', 'Land cover classification', 'Remote sensing', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'VHR image classification']",,"Image classification of very high resolution (VHR) images is a fundamental task in the remote sensing domain for various applications, such as land cover mapping, vegetation mapping, and urban planning. Recently, deep learning-based semantic segmentation networks demonstrated the promising performance for pixel-level image classification. However, deep learning-based approaches are generally limited by the requirement of a sufficient amount of labeled data to obtain stable accuracy, and acquiring reference labels of remotely-sensed VHR images is very labor-extensive and expensive. Hence, this paper applied a semi-supervised learning-based CycleGAN and EfficientNet for VHR remote sensing image classification to overcome this problem. The proposed method achieved the highest accuracy than the other benchmarks. The largest increase in accuracy was observed in a test site containing complex objects due to the regularization effect of the semi-supervised method using unlabeled data. Moreover, results indicated that a relatively sufficient amount of unlabeled data compared with labeled data are required to increase the classification accuracy by controlling the amount of labeled and unlabeled data. Finally, we verified that the semi-supervised method returned significantly improved results irrespective of the three classification network structures, displaying the applicability of the method for semi-supervised image classification on remotely-sensed VHR images."

Conceptual framework of hybrid style in fashion image datasets for machine learning,2023,"['Fashion image', 'Hybrid style', 'Machine learning', 'K-fashion', 'Supervised learning datasets']",,"Fashion image datasets, in which each fashion image has a label indicating its design attributes and styles, have contributed to the achievement of various machine learning techniques in the fashion industry. Computer vision studies have investigated labeling categories (such as fashion items, colors, materials, details, and styles) to create fashion image datasets for supervised learning. Although a considerable number of fashion image datasets has been developed, different style classification criteria exist because of a lack of understanding concerning fashion style. Since fashion styles reflect various design attributes, multiple styles can often be included in a single outfit. Thus, this study aims to build a Hybrid Style Framework to develop a fashion image dataset that can be efficiently applied to supervised learning. We conducted focus group interviews with six fashion experts to determine fashion style categories with which to classify hybrid styles in fashion images. We developed 1,206,931K-fashion image datasets and analyzed the hybrid style convergence. Finally, we applied the datasets to the machine learning model and verified the accuracy of the computer’s ability to recognize style. Overall, this study concludes that the Hybrid Style Framework and developed K-fashion image datasets are helpful, as they can be applied to data-driven fashion services to offer personalized fashion design solutions."

Throughout the modeling, training, testing, and cross-validation processes, supervised machine learning methods were used to analyze the datasets exhaustively. Four performance indicators (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2) were used to evaluate and contrast the precision of the algorithms. Based on the findings of the coefficient of determination, the LGBM algorithm has the highest prediction accuracy of 0.94048, followed by XGB with 0.8631 accuracy and gradient boosting with 0.8547 accuracy. The optimal condition for producing biodiesel through GA was a molar ratio of 7.62:1 with a catalyst concentration of 0.5 wt%, a reaction temperature of 65 °C, and a reaction time of 105 min and the corresponding value of the biodiesel yield was 98.98% (by wt.). Experiments confirmed this prediction, and with acceptable error, all results are close to the model’s predicted values.

Decision-making for Connected and Automated Vehicles in Chanllenging Traffic Conditions Using Imitation and Deep Reinforcement Learning,2023,"['Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs)', 'Traffic safety', 'Decision-making', 'Imitation learning', 'Deep reinforcement learning']",,"Decision-making is the “brain” of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and is vitally critical to the safety of CAVs. The most of driving data used to train the decision-making algorithms is collected in general traffic conditions. Existing decision-making methods are difficult to guarantee safety in challenging traffic conditions, namely severe congestion and accident ahead. In this context, a semi-supervised decision-making algorithm is proposed to improve the safety of CAVs in challenging traffic conditions. To be specific, we proposed the expert-generative adversarial imitation learning (E-GAIL) that integrates imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning. The proposed E-GAIL is deployed in roadside unit (RSU). In the first stage, the decision-making knowledge of the expert is imitated using the real-world data collected in general traffic conditions. In the second stage, the generator of E-GAIL is further reinforced and achieves self-learn decision-making in the simulator with challenging traffic conditions. The E-GAIL is tested in general and challenging traffic conditions. By comparing the evaluation metrics of time to collision (TTC), deceleration to avoid a crash (DRAC), space gap (SGAP) and time gap (TGAP), the E-GAIL greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms. Experimental results show that the E-GAIL not only make-decision for CAVs in general traffic conditions but also successfully enhances the safety of CAVs in challenging traffic conditions."

Ensemble Teacher: Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Teacher’s Cross-Pseudo Supervision,2023,"['Semi-supervised segmentation', 'Cross pseudo supervision', 'Exponential mean average']",,"Semi-supervised learning utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data has recently made significant progress; however, while semi-supervised image classification research has been actively conducted and solved many problems, semisupervised semantic segmentation research still has some problems that need to be solved. In this work, semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which requires more annotation work than other tasks such as classification, was investigated because labels are required on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Consistency regularization based on input image perturbation, feature perturbation, and network perturbation in the semi-supervised learning approach showed significant performance improvement. In particular, consistency regularization through network perturbation showed excellent performance in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. However, important challenges remain. Due to pseudo-label bias, inaccurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data can negatively affect training, which causes more serious problems in semi supervised segmentation tasks. This study mitigates the pseudo-label bias issue by expanding the network perturbation-based method, which has shown excellent results, through a simple ensemble strategy. In addition, this simple method shows improved prediction performance. The results of this study outperform previous state-of-the-art methods and achieve state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation performance. The proposed method can be practically applied to the handson data science domain that hardly obtains sufficient class-labels (e.g. medicine, manufacturing, etc.)."

Identifying Disease of Interest With Deep Learning Using Diagnosis Code,2023,"['Deep Learning', 'Gastric Cancer', 'Machine Learning', 'Prediction', 'Diagnosis Code']",,"Background: Autoencoder (AE) is one of the deep learning techniques that uses an artificial neural network to reconstruct its input data in the output layer. We constructed a novel supervised AE model and tested its performance in the prediction of a co-existence of the disease of interest only using diagnostic codes.Methods: Diagnostic codes of one million randomly sampled patients listed in the Korean National Health Information Database in 2019 were used to train, validate, and test the prediction model. The first used AE solely for a feature engineering tool for an input of a classifier. Supervised Multi-Layer Perceptron (sMLP) was added to train a classifier to predict a binary level with latent representation as an input (AE + sMLP). The second model simultaneously updated the parameters in the AE and the connected MLP classifier during the learning process (End-to-End Supervised AE [EEsAE]). We tested the performances of these two models against baseline models, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and naïve Bayes, in the prediction of co-existing gastric cancer diagnosis.Results: The proposed EEsAE model yielded the highest F1-score and highest area under the curve (0.86). The EEsAE and AE + sMLP gave the highest recalls. XGB yielded the highest precision. Ablation study revealed that iron deficiency anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, essential hypertension, gastric ulcers, benign prostate hyperplasia, and shoulder lesion were the top 6 most influential diagnoses on performance.Conclusion: A novel EEsAE model showed promising performance in the prediction of a disease of interest."
Deep-learning-based fault detection and recipe optimization for a plastic injection molding process under the class-imbalance problem,2023,"['deep learning', 'class-imbalance problem', 'fault detection', 'recipe optimization', 'plastic injection molding process']",,"This paper proposes a supervised learning with a class-balancing loss function (SL-CBL) approach for fault detection and feature-similarity-based recipe optimization (FSRO) for a plastic injection molding process. SL-CBL is a novel method that can accurately classify an input sample as a normal or fault condition, even when the training data are severely class-imbalanced. The proposed class-balancing loss function consists of the weighted focal loss and the loss of the F1 score; together, these are used to correctly classify even a small number of faulty samples. SL-CBL is investigated with four classifiers of different structures; the classifiers consist of several fully connected and batch normalization layers. FSRO is an optimization scheme that finds the optimal recipe whose feature is similar to the features of normal samples. The optimal solution is obtained by minimizing the Euclidean distance to the centroid of the normal features. In this research, the proposed SL-CBL and FSRO methods are validated by applying them to an industrial plastic injection molding dataset. The validation results show that the proposed SL-CBL approach achieves the highest F1 score with the lowest misclassification rate, as compared to the alternative methods. When visualizing the feature space, the optimal recipe found by the FSRO scheme was found to be close to the centroid of the normal features, even if the initial recipe is classified as a fault. Furthermore, each variable of the optimized recipe lies within the confidence interval of 3${\rm{\sigma }}$ for the normal condition. This indicates that the optimal recipe is statistically similar to the normal samples."

Seismic Acceleration Estimation Method at Arbitrary Position Using Observations and Machine Learning,2023,"['Machine-learning regression', 'Seismic acceleration prediction', 'Seismic measurement station', 'Supervised learning']",,"This study proposes a method of estimating the measurement data of nearby seismic stations by training an artificial neural network (ANN) through machine learning to understand the seismic acceleration time history at an arbitrary location where seismic acceleration time history is unknown. The ANN is trained using the observation data of 6 earthquakes at 10 ground seismic stations in Korea and 12 earthquakes at 212 underground seismic stations from the Korea Meteorological Administration. The location of the seismic station is assumed to be arbitrary in the untrained observation data to verify the validity of the trained ANN, and the measured and estimated data are compared. It is confirmed that the estimation accuracy of the ANN trained with the observation data of the underground seismic station is higher than that of the ANN trained with the observation data of the ground seismic station.

It can also be applied as seismic acceleration to evaluate seismic damage or behavior of structures or facilities, even in places without seismic acceleration."
"Sound-Based Abnormal Combustion Classification Model for High Compression Ratio, Spark-Ignition Engines Using Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients and Ensemble Learning Algorithms",2023,"['Engine knock', 'Supervised learning', 'Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients', 'Ensemble learning']",,"A supervised machine learning model was developed to determine knocking in a spark ignition engine. The engine sound was delivered to an operator via an extended metal tube installed on the cylinder block. The sound was recorded using a smartphone at a sample frequency of 48,000 Hz. Thirty-nine features were extracted from the mel-frequency cepstrum and spectral analysis. Neighborhood component analysis was performed to select eight features with the highest contributions. The gentle adaptive boosting scheme, available in MATLAB, achieved the best results among the nine ensemble algorithms used in this study, regardless of whether it was trained using all 39 features or the eight selected features. The best model exhibited 99.98 % accuracy in classifying knock sounds and 99.85 % in classifying normal sounds. A second round of validation was performed to investigate the robustness of the proposed model. The dataset used in this round was acquired from a slightly advanced spark timing case, in which knock intensity varied from mild to severe. The model achieved 100 % accuracy in detecting both knock and normal sounds. Each signal segment contained an individual cycle sound to evaluate the feasibility of a model for detecting individual knock cycles during real-time engine sound monitoring."

For these reasons, a machine learning model was developed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) as an objective decision to classify the Aβ positive and Aβ negative status from brain amyloid PET images.Methods: A total of 7,344 PET images of 144 subjects were used in this study. The 18F-florbetaben PET was administered to all participants, and the criteria for differentiating Aβ positive and Aβ negative state was based on brain amyloid plaque load score (BAPL) that depended on the visual assessment of PET images by the physicians.

The model accuracy for classifying Aβ positivity and Aβ negativity was (95.00±0.02) in the test dataset. The sensitivity and specificity were (96.00±0.02) and (94.00±0.02), respectively, with an area under the curve of (87.00±0.03).Conclusions: Based on this study, the designed CNN model has the potential to be used clinically to screen amyloid PET images."
A deep-learning method using single phantom to enhance megavoltage image quality for patient positioning in chest radiotherapy: a feasibility study,2023,['Deep learning · Megavoltage image · Kilovoltage image · Radiotherapy · Patient setup'],,"Image-guided radiation treatment (IGRT) is essential for verifying patient positioning during modern radiotherapy. Although megavoltage digital radiographs (MV-DR) are available on most therapeutic linear accelerators and can be used for checking treatment beam shapes, they are much inferior to kilovoltage digital radiographs (KV-DR) in terms of image quality. As it is generally challenging to obtain a well-aligned MV−KV training dataset of patients in clinical scenarios, there is a lack of sufcient information on the accuracy of KV-DR synthesized using supervised training. Therefore, we aimed to synthesize pseudo KV-DR (pKV-DR) from MV-DR using a training dataset developed with a single anthropomorphic chest phantom.The phantom was adopted to obtain MV−KV image pairs at various gantry angles because these image pairs of patients are highly difcult to acquire and exactly align with each other. A deep-learning model based on U-net architecture was trained with the phantom image pairs using the mean absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity (SSIM) indices as loss functions.The mean MAEs of MV-DR and pKV-DR against KV-DR as the ground truth were 0.1152 and 0.0169, respectively, and their mean SSIM values were 0.9693 and 0.9942, respectively. Finally, pKV-DR showed a relatively high image similarity to that of KV-DR with smaller MAE (14.7%) and higher SSIM (2.5%), compared with MV-DR. The image contrast was also improved by 37.1% in clinical cases. The proposed method is expected to enable the implementation of improved IGRT with high image quality of KV-DR level, even in clinics where MV-DR is only available."

If objects in a photographic image are recognized by a component of construction structure, the image could serve as a valuable tool in construction schedule management. In this study, authors present a framework for automatically recognizing objects for each component of a structure in a photographic image. To this end, after collecting and training a large amount of photographic images from the railroad bridge structures, an object detection method that can automatically recognize the construction components of the bridge structure based on deep learning model was introduced. Images are procured through web crawling, and the collected images are pre-treated for supervised training. The results of the deep learning model showed high performance in the pier and coping classes, and the slab showed a rather low accuracy, and it was confirmed that the degree of utilization of the detection results was significantly affected by the angle of shooting the image."
Comparison of different machine learning algorithms to estimate liquid level for bioreactor management,2023,"['Anaerobic digestion', 'Machine learning', 'Multicollinearity', 'Regression', 'Supervised learning']",,"Estimating the liquid level in an anaerobic digester can be disturbed by its closedness, bubbles and scum formation, and the inhomogeneity of the digestate. In our previous study, a soft-sensor approach using seven pressure meters has been proposed as an alternative for real-time liquid level estimation. Here, machine learning techniques were used to improve the estimation accuracy and optimize the number of sensors required in this approach. Four algorithms, multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function kernel were compared for this purpose. All models outperformed the cubic model developed in the previous study, among which the ANN and RF models performed the best. Variable importance analysis suggested that the pressure readings from the top (in the headspace) were the most significant, while the other pressure meters showed varying significance levels depending on the model type. The sensor that experienced both headspace and liquid phases depending on the level variation incurred a higher error than other sensors. The results showed that the ML techniques can provide an effective tool to estimate digester liquid levels by optimizing the number of sensors and reducing the error rate."

However, such management was limited due to spatial and economic problems. To realize a smart zero-energy city, studying efficient energy integration for the entire city, not just for a single house or building, is necessary. Therefore, this study was conducted in the eco-friendly energy town of Chungbuk Innovation City. Chungbuk successfully realized energy independence by converging new and renewable energy facilities for the first time in South Korea. This study analyzes energy data collected from public buildings in that town every minute for a year. We propose a smart city building-energy management model based on the results that combine various renewable energy sources with grid power. Supervised learning can determine when it is best to sell surplus electricity, or unsupervised learning can be used if there is a particular pattern or rule for energy use. However, it is more appropriate to use reinforcement learning to maximize rewards in an environment with numerous variables that change every moment. Therefore, we propose a power distribution algorithm based on reinforcement learning that considers the sales of Energy Storage System power from surplus renewable energy. Finally, we confirm through economic analysis that a 10% saving is possible from this efficiency."
A Supervised Framework for Sentiment Analysis: A Two-Stage Approach,2023,"['natural language', 'neural network', 'sentiment analysis', 'text embedding']",,"Sentiment analysis (SA) is a vital part of natural language processing (NLP). It involves analyzing textual data to determine expressed sentiment, be it positive or negative. Transformer-based models have gained popularity for sentiment prediction from the text. However, achieving promising results with these models requires extensive training data and processing power. Additionally, when using pre-trained transformer models for sentiment analysis, they do not generate sentiment-specific text embeddings as they are trained on large general-purpose corpora. To address these challenges, this paper presents a two-step framework. Firstly, the framework aims to learn high-level sentiment-oriented embeddings of text. It generates embeddings with Siamese Network and compares them based on their sentiment class using the triplet loss function. This approach enables the framework to capture distinctions between positive and negative sentences, ensuring the generation of sentiment-specific embeddings. Secondly, it incorporates a classification layer on top of the embedding layer to enhance sentiment classification. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework, surpassing baseline sentiment analysis results on various benchmark datasets."

Therefore, a 2D view of the 3D anatomy is sometimes sufficient for the initial diagnosis. However, close to fourteen commonly occurring diseases are sometimes difficult to identify by visually inspecting the images. Therefore, there is a drift toward developing computer-aided assistive systems to help radiologists. This paper proposes a deep learning model for the classification and localization of chest diseases by using image-level annotations. The model consists of a modified Resnet50 backbone for extracting feature corpus from the images, a classifier, and a pixel correlation module (PCM). During PCM training, the network is a weight-shared siamese architecture where the first branch applies the affine transform to the image before feeding to the network, while the second applies the same transform to the network output. The method was evaluated on CXR from the clinical center in the ratio of 70:20 for training and testing. The model was developed and tested using the cloud computing platform Google Colaboratory (NVidia Tesla P100 GPU, 16 GB of RAM). A radiologist subjectively validated the results.

However, this method has a problem in that there is a clear difference in the boundary of the patch. NSA for solving these problems have achieved higher anomaly detection performance by generating natural synthetic data through Poisson Blending. However, NSA has the disadvantage of having many hyperparameters that need to be adjusted for each class. In this paper, synthetic data similar to normal were generated by a simple method of making the size of the synthetic patch very small. At this time, since the patches are so locally synthesized, models that learn local features can easily overfit synthetic data. Therefore, we performed anomaly detection using gMLP, which learns global features, and even with simple synthesis methods, we were able to achieve higher performance than conventional self-supervised learning techniques."

While manual detection of potholes using human labor is commonly used to prevent pothole-related accidents, it is economically and temporally inefficient due to the exposure of workers on the road and the difficulty in predicting potholes in certain categories.Therefore, completely preventing potholes is nearly impossible, and even preventing their formation is limited due to the influence of ground conditions closely related to road environments. Additionally, labeling work guided by experts is required for dataset construction. Thus, in this paper, we utilized the Mean Teacher technique, one of the semi-supervised learning-based knowledge distillation methods, to achieve robust performance in pothole image classification even with limited labeled data.

However, obtaining substantial high-quality labeled data to enhance the performance of deep learning models entails economic and temporal constraints. As a solution for this problem, semi-supervised learning, using a limited amount of labeled data, has been gaining traction. This study assesses the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning in the defect detection process of manufacturing using the MixMatch algorithm. The MixMatch algorithm incorporates three dominant paradigms in the semi-supervised field: Consistency regularization, Entropy minimization, and Generic regularization. The performance of semi-supervised learning based on the MixMatch algorithm was compared with that of supervised learning using defect image data from the metal casting process. For the experiments, the ratio of labeled data was adjusted to 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50% of the total data. At a labeled data ratio of 5%, semi-supervised learning achieved a classification accuracy of 90.19%, outperforming supervised learning by approximately 22%p. At a 10% ratio, it surpassed supervised learning by around 8%p, achieving a 92.89% accuracy.

The simulation study was conducted to compare the diagnostic accuracy of neural networks trained with both ‘Bayesian-based augmented dataset’ and ‘expert-labeled dataset’ across four factors: ‘item quality’, ‘expert labeling error rate’, ‘size of the expert labeled dataset’, and ‘size of the augmented dataset’. Additionally, the real data consists of the binary responses of 936 middle-school students to 24 arithmetic problems on linear equations and linear inequalities.Results The performance of supervised learning trained on the ‘Bayesian-based augmented dataset’ showed significant improvements in all conditions compared to solely using the ‘expert-labeled dataset’. The effect of the labeling error rate and the size of the expert-labeled dataset was trivial. As the quality of the items increased and the size of the augmented dataset grew, accuracy improved, though beyond a certain size N=3,000 of the augmented dataset, the difference was negligible. For the real data on linear equations and inequalities, supervised learning trained on the ‘Bayesian-based augmented dataset’ showed enhanced accuracy over just on the ‘expert-labeled dataset’. It is also evident that students understand solving linear equations better than solving linear inequalities.Conclusions When performing supervised learning based cognitive diagnosis with a small expert-labeled dataset, the diagnostic performance can be enhanced through Bayesian-based data augmentation method.Moreover, students tend to find understanding inequalities more challenging than equations, suggesting the need for opportunities to master cognitive attributes related to inequalities."

In the case of data that reflect the real world, imbalance data may occur depending on the frequency of occurrence of events or the difficulty of collection. Data with an inconsistent number of classes that make up the data are called imbalance data, and in particular, it is difficult to learn the minority classes with relatively little data through Deep Learning algorithms. Recently, Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) have been applied as a method for data augmentation, and self-supervised learning-based pre-learning has been proposed for minority class learning. However, because class information of imbalance data is utilized in the process of learning the Generative Model, the quality of generated data is poor due to poor learning of minority classes. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a similarity-based exhaustive contrast learning method. The proposed method is quantitatively evaluated through the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS). The method proposed in this paper confirmed the performance improvement of the Frechet Inception Distance of 16.32 and the Inception Score of 0.38, as compared to the existing method."

The supervised learning-based deep-learning seismic inversion uses time-domain wavefields as input and subsurface velocity models as output. Because the time-domain wavefields contain various types of wave information, the data size is considerably large. Therefore, research applying supervised learning-based deep-learning seismic inversion trained with a significant amount of field-scale data has not yet been conducted. In this study, we predict subsurface velocity models using Laplace-domain wavefields as input instead of time-domain wavefields to apply a supervised learning-based deep-learning seismic inversion technique to field-scale data. Using Laplace-domain wavefields instead of time-domain wavefields significantly reduces the size of the input data, thereby accelerating the neural network training, although the resolution of the results is reduced. Additionally, a large grid interval can be used to efficiently predict the velocity model of the field data size, and the results obtained can be used as the initial model for subsequent inversions. The neural network is trained using only synthetic data by generating a massive synthetic velocity model and Laplace-domain wavefields of the same size as the field-scale data. In addition, we adopt a towed-streamer acquisition geometry to simulate a marine seismic survey. Testing the trained network on numerical examples using the test data and a benchmark model yielded appropriate background velocity models."

The number of infrastructure structures reaching their lifespan is increasing, and the proportion of old structures is gradually increasing. The functions and performance of these structures at the time of design may deteriorate and may even lead to safety accidents. To prevent this repercussion, accurate inspection and appropriate repair are requisite.To this end, demand is increasing for computer vision and deep learning technology to accurately detect even minute cracks. However, deep learning algorithms require a large number of training data. In particular, label images indicating the location of cracks in the image are required. To secure a large number of those label images, a lot of labor and time are consumed. To reduce these costs as well as increase detection accuracy, this study proposed a learning structure based on mean teacher method. This learning structure was trained on a dataset of 900 labeled image dataset and 3000 unlabeled image dataset. The crack detection network model was evaluated on over 300 labeled image dataset, and the detection accuracy recorded a mean intersection over union of 89.23% and an F1 score of 89.12%. Through this experiment, it was confirmed that detection performance was improved compared to supervised learning. It is expected that this proposed method will be used in the future to reduce the cost required to secure label images."

Therefore, research on anomaly detection methods using data learning-based artificial intelligence technology is increasing. In addition, supervised learning-based anomaly detection methods are difficult to use in real environments because they require sufficient labeled data for learning. Research on an unsupervised learning-based method that learns from normal data and detects an anomaly by finding a pattern in the data itself has been actively conducted. Therefore, this study aims to extract a latent vector that preserves useful sequence information from sequence log data and develop an anomaly detection learning model using the extracted latent vector. Word2Vec was used to create a dense vector representation corresponding to the characteristics of each sequence, and an unsupervised autoencoder was developed to extract latent vectors from sequence data expressed as dense vectors. The developed autoencoder model is a recurrent neural network GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) based denoising autoencoder suitable for sequence data, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network-based autoencoder to solve the limited short-term memory problem that GRU can have, and an autoencoder combining GRU and one-dimensional convolution was used. The data used in the experiment is time-series-based NGIDS (Next Generation IDS Dataset) data, and as a result of the experiment, an autoencoder that combines GRU and one-dimensional convolution is better than a model using a GRU-based autoencoder or a one-dimensional convolution-based autoencoder. It was efficient in terms of learning time for extracting useful latent patterns from training data, and showed stable performance with smaller fluctuations in anomaly detection performance."

This study compares the inference accuracy of deep learning models YOLOv5, YOLOX, and YOLOv7 according to training datasets. As training data, the three types of datasets were prepared as follows. First, A basic dataset, composed of five species of Vespa and one bee, is produced for the Vespa training data set. Next, The 0.3% dataset, in which Hornet object size is approximately 0.3% ratio to the whole image size in pixels, is prepared using the basic dataset for tiny object detection.

Also, we study the way to make best use of the effect for Korean speechanimation generation. The effect can contribute to efficiently and efficaciously revitalizing the recently inactive Korean speech animationresearch, by clarifying the top priority research target. This paper performs this process: (i) it chooses blendshape animation technique,(ii) implements the deep-learning model in the master-servant pipeline of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) module and the facialaction coding (FAC) module, (iii) makes Korean speech facial motion capture dataset, (iv) prepares two comparison deep learning models(one model adopts the English ASR module, the other model adopts the Korean ASR module, however both models adopt the same basicstructure for their FAC modules), and (v) train the FAC modules of both models dependently on their ASR modules. The user studydemonstrates that the model which adopts the Korean ASR module and dependently trains its FAC module (getting 4.2/5.0 points) generatesdecisively much more natural Korean speech animations than the model which adopts the English ASR module and dependently trainsits FAC module (getting 2.7/5.0 points). The result confirms the aforementioned effect showing that the quality of the Korean speechanimation comes down to the accuracy of Korean ASR."

This attitude of mind is the driving force behind the search for truth, the reform of the world, nature, society surrounding humans, and the construction of a new ideal society. Here, Eclecticism refers to cutting off personal attachment to self-assertion and prejudice against opposing arguments and positions on various factions and objectifies the object to create the best way forward.The political theory of harmonious compromise (Harmony and Eclecticism) leads to a monarchy in which the monarch and his subjects co-operate. Since the monarch and his subjects are entrusted with the task of ruling on behalf of the heavens, a commonwealth is established. King’s learning (經筵) as well as supervision and consultation to the king and his subjects(臺諫) provided institutional guarantees to the success of the political theory of harmonious compromise (Harmony and Eclecticism).The collaborative politics of the monarch and his subjects led to the theories of monarch’s learning of sagehood and the organization of monarchical literature. Monarch’s learning of sagehood is the study of a monarch becoming a saint, that is, a monarch understanding the way of things through the study of the scriptures and grasping the right thing to do. At this time, the king is imperfect as a natural person, so the monarch is required to cultivate the qualities and virtues of a king through the learning of sagehood. Monarchical literature in this view include “Daehakjeoneu(The Extended Meaning of The Great Learning)”, “Gyeongjemungambyeoljip”, “Saseojoryo”, “Chipyeongyoram”, “Daehakjeoneujipyak”, etc. These texts emphasize the moral cultivation of monarchs and believe that they can rule the country on this basis."

Knowledge distillation (KD), which transfers knowledge from a teacher network to a student network, has been investigated as a method to make efficient and lightweight neural network models. However, KD requires the high cost to find appropriate teacher models. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning based self-distillation (CLSD) for lightweight single image super-resolution model without teacher model. By constructing of an auxiliary task model within the intermediate feature map of the student model and the training of each auxiliary model using contrastive loss, the proposed method improved performance by directing the overall feature map of the existing student model toward task-specific biases. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the task performance compared to KD and conventional self-distillation methods in the EDSR model."

This algorithm improves the noise attenuation performance by using the FNN (Full-connected Neural Network) deep learning algorithm instead of the existing adaptive filter after wavelet transform. After wavelet transforming the input signal for each short-time period, noise is removed from a single input audio signal containing noise by using a 1024-1024-512-neuron FNN deep learning model. This transforms the time-domain voice signal into the time-frequency domain so that the noise characteristics are well expressed, and effectively predicts voice in a noisy environment through supervised learning using the conversion parameter of the pure voice signal for the conversion parameter. In order to verify the performance of the noise reduction system proposed in this study, a simulation program using Tensorflow and Keras libraries was written and a simulation was performed.

In particular, the demand for analyzing texts in specialized domains is rapidly increasing. Therefore, studies are being conducted to analyze specialized and general- purpose documents simultaneously. To analyze specific terms with general terms, it is necessary to align the embedding space of the specific terms with the embedding space of the general terms. So far, attempts have been made to align the embedding of specific terms into the embedding space of general terms through a transformation matrix or mapping function. However, the linear transformation based on the transformation matrix showed a limitation in that it only works well in a local range.To overcome this limitation, various types of nonlinear vector alignment methods have been recently proposed. We propose a vector alignment model that matches the embedding space of specific terms to the embedding space of general terms through end-to-end learning that simultaneously learns the autoencoder and regression model.

In addition, after developing a supervision model for novice counselors tailored to the developmental characteristics of novice counselors, the supervision process was embodied by applying the backword design principle centered on learner understanding.Results As a result of the study, the supervision model for first-time counselors for graduate students majoring in counseling consisted of four phases: ‘preparation’, ‘start’, ‘execution’, and ‘end’. Each stage of the developed phase consists of a total of 10 sub-processes similar to the counseling process, resulting in structured supervision content in which first-time counselors achieve the common competencies of competent counselors and their own individualization goals.Conclusions The devised model was developed similar to the counseling performance process, reflecting the developmental characteristics and needs of novice counselors, and is highly consistent in Supervision's learning and evaluation to help Supervisor successfully achieve Supervision goals. This model is a systematic, comprehensive, and continuous understanding-oriented supervision model in that it allows novice counselors to transfer what they have learned from supervision to various counseling contexts even after supervision."

Most data-centric deep learning challenges necessitate the use of supervised learning methodologies to attain high accuracy and to facilitate performance evaluation through comparison with the ground truth. Supervised learning mandates a substantial amount of image and label sets, however, procuring an adequate volume of medical imaging data for training is a formidable task. Various data augmentation strategies can mitigate the underfitting issue inherent in supervised learning-based models that are trained on limited medical image and label sets. This research investigates the enhancement of a deep learning-based rib fracture segmentation model and the efficacy of data augmentation techniques such as left-right flipping, rotation, and scaling. Augmented dataset with L/R flipping and rotations(30°, 60°) increased model performance, however, dataset with rotation(90°) and ⨯0.5 rescaling decreased model performance. This indicates the usage of appropriate data augmentation methods depending on datasets and tasks."

The deep learning model consisted of four convolutional layers and was trained with a weakly supervised learning method that can provide object localization only using image-level labeling. Localization of the soybean area can be visualized via CAM and the two-dimensional position of the soybean was estimated by clustering the pixels associated with the soybean area and transforming the pixel coordinates to world coordinates. The actual position, which is determined manually as pixel coordinates in the image was evaluated and performances were 6.6(X-axis), 5.1(Y-axis) and 1.2(X-axis), 2.2(Y-axis) for MSE and RMSE about world coordinates, respectively. From the results, we confirmed that the center position of the soybean area derived through deep learning was sufficient for use in automatic weeding systems."

Whisper was pretrained on a large corpus (around 680,000 hours) of web speech data and has demonstrated strong recognition performance for major languages.However, it faces challenges in recognizing languages such as Korean, which is not major language while training.We address this issue by fine-tuning the Whisper model with an additional dataset comprising about 1,000 hours of Korean speech. We also compare its performance against a Transformer model that was trained from scratch using the same dataset. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the Whisper model significantly improved its Korean speech recognition capabilities in terms of character error rate (CER). Specifically, the performance improved with increasing model size.However, the Whisper model’s performance on English deteriorated post fine-tuning, emphasizing the need for further research to develop robust multilingual models.

Point cloud upsampling using deep selfsampling with point saliency,2023,['· Point cloud upsampling · Self-sampling · Self-supervised learning · Visual saliency · Multi-step upsampling'],,"Point cloud upsampling is a process of increasing the point density to represent an object or environment effectively. Recent studies have focused on deep learning-based approaches that learn mapping from a sparse to a dense region of the point cloud. Selfsupervised learning-based upsampling techniques have gained attention due to their capability to learn predefined characteristics without previous training on a large dataset. This study proposes deep self-sampling with point saliency. The approach involves the use of a self-sampling network with two predefined consolidation strategies, namely density and curvature, along with a saliency feature, to restore the underlying characteristics of an object effectively. Additionally, multistep upsampling is applied to determine the best order of different consolidation strategies for optimal results. Experimental results show that multistep self-sampling using point saliency outperforms the existing approach because it can effectively restore the underlying shapes of the object qualitatively and quantitatively."

RNN-based integrated system for real-time sensor fault detection and fault-informed accident diagnosis in nuclear power plant accidents,2023,"['Nuclear power plants', 'Sensor fault detection', 'Recurrent neural network', 'Accident diagnosis', 'Fault-tolerant system', 'Real-time execution']",,"Sensor faults in nuclear power plant instrumentation have the potential to spread negative effects from wrong signals that can cause an accident misdiagnosis by plant operators. To detect sensor faults and make accurate accident diagnoses, prior studies have developed a supervised learning-based sensor fault detection model and an accident diagnosis model with faulty sensor isolation. Even though the developed neural network models demonstrated satisfactory performance, their diagnosis performance should be reevaluated considering real-time connection. When operating in real-time, the diagnosis model is expected to indiscriminately accept fault data before receiving delayed fault information transferred from the previous fault detection model. The uncertainty of neural networks can also have a significant impact following the sensor fault features. In the present work, a pilot study was conducted to connect two models and observe actual outcomes from a real-time application with an integrated system.While the initial results showed an overall successful diagnosis, some issues were observed. To recover the diagnosis performance degradations, additive logics were applied to minimize the diagnosis failures that were not observed in the previous validations of the separate models. The results of a case study were then analyzed in terms of the real-time diagnosis outputs that plant operators would actually face in an emergency situation."
Multi-classification Sensitive Image Detection Method Based on Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network,2023,"['Sensitive image detection', 'Lightweight convolutional neural network', 'EfficientNet', 'Model Pruning']",,"In recent years, the rapid development of social networks has led to a rapid increase in the amount of information available on the Internet, which contains a large amount of sensitive information related to pornography, politics, and terrorism. In the aspect of sensitive image detection, the existing machine learning algorithms are confronted with problems such as large model size, long training time, and slow detection speed when auditing and supervising. In order to detect sensitive images more accurately and quickly, this paper proposes a multi-classification sensitive image detection method based on lightweight Convolutional Neural Network. On the basis of the EfficientNet model, this method combines the Ghost Module idea of the GhostNet model and adds the SE channel attention mechanism in the Ghost Module for feature extraction training. The experimental results on the sensitive image data set constructed in this paper show that the accuracy of the proposed method in sensitive information detection is 94.46% higher than that of the similar methods. Then, the model is pruned through an ablation experiment, and the activation function is replaced by Hard-Swish, which reduces the parameters of the original model by 54.67%. Under the condition of ensuring accuracy, the detection time of a single image is reduced from 8.88ms to 6.37ms. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the method put forward has successfully enhanced the precision of identifying multi-class sensitive images, significantly decreased the number of parameters in the model, and achieved higher accuracy than comparable algorithms while using a more lightweight model design."

This study aimed to investigate the diverse landscape of ER, revealing the extensive range of genres, topics, and book selections it contains. The study examined a group of 83 nursing students in Seoul, who were divided into two groups: one receiving teacher guidance and the other engaging in self-directed learning. The program lasted for a duration of 15 weeks and focused on extensive reading training. The results indicated a strong preference for non-fiction literature, particularly in the field of Science, which aligns with the professional interests of the nursing students who took part in the study. The group that was supervised by the teacher demonstrated a wider range of subject study, particularly in the areas of Science, Social Studies, and History, highlighting the significance of having organized direction. On the other hand, the self-directed group exhibited a more equitable distribution of reading materials, encompassing both fiction and non-fiction genres. The observation may potentially indicate a correlation with their personal motivations and educational paths. Notable correlations were observed among specific subjects, suggesting a strong inclination towards interdisciplinary pursuits and the possibility of integrating disparate areas of knowledge. The books that are most frequently read tend to be focused on the subject of Science, while also maintaining a balanced reading level. This suggests that students have a preference for materials that are neither excessively simplistic nor excessively hard. Despite being somewhat overshadowed by factual content, narratives continue to maintain their attractiveness, therefore underlining their crucial position in the landscape of extensive reading settings. Furthermore, the study provides valuable perspectives on the reading habits of second language (L2) learners, emphasizing the ongoing popularity of narratives, the need of multidisciplinary education, and the delicate equilibrium between self-direction and instructional support. The aforementioned discoveries have the potential to impact instructional approaches, leading to a more effective integration of student needs and interests. Additionally, they provide a foundation for future investigations into the underlying motivations driving these preferences for reading materials."

준지도 학습 모델을 사용한 차량 내부 네트워크에서의 이상 징후 탐지,2023,"['Cloud Storage', 'Client-Side Deduplication', 'Identification Attack', 'Data Deletion Process', 'Cloud Security']","현재 자동차 내부의 전자 제어 장치(Electronic Control Unit, ECU)간의 통신을 위해 CAN(Controller Area Network) 프로토콜을 많이 사용하고 있다. 하지만 CAN 프로토콜은 메시지 암호화 및 발신자 인증과 같은 보안 기능을 가지고 있지 않아 인가되지 않은 데이터 주입이나 서비스 거부 공격(Denial of Service, DoS) 등과 같은 사이버 보안위협에 취약하다. 따라서 최근에는 자동차의 CAN 네트워크를 보호하기 위한 인공 지능 기반의 침입 탐지 시스템(Intrusion Detection System, IDS)에 대한 연구가 활발하게 진행되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 먼저 CAN 버스의 데이터 트래픽에 대한 메시지 주입 공격을 탐지할 수 있는 지도 학습(supervised learning)을 사용하는 딥러닝 모델인 DCNN(Deep Convolutional Neural network) 기반의 이상 탐지 모델을 구현하였다. 또한, 지도 학습 모델은 학습용 데이터 셋이 많아야 한다는 한계점을 지적하고 이를 보완하기 위해 준지도 학습(semi-supervised learning)을 사용한 딥러닝 모델인 GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) 기반의 이상 탐지 모델을 제안한다. 제안하는 준지도 학습 기반의 이상 탐지 모델은 기존 지도 학습 모델에서 약 20만 개의 데이터로 학습하던 것을 1,000개의 데이터만으로도 서비스 거부 공격과 스푸핑 공격을 99%이상 탐지할 수 있어 효율적인 차량용 이상 징후 탐지 시스템으로 사용할 수 있다.","The CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol is used widely for communication between ECUs (Electronic Control Units) in a vehicle network. On the other hand, the CAN protocol is vulnerable to cyber security threats, such as unauthorized data injection and DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, because it does not have security functions, such as message encryption and sender authentication. Therefore, research on an artificial intelligence-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) for protecting the CAN network has been actively conducted. This paper reports an anomaly detection model based on a DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network), a deep learning model using supervised learning that can detect message injection attacks on data traffic on CAN buses. The supervised learning model requires a large number of training data sets. This paper proposes an anomaly detection model based on GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), a deep learning model using semi-supervised learning, to compensate for this advantage. The proposed anomaly detection model based on semi-supervised learning can be used as an efficient vehicle anomaly detection system because it can detect more than 99% of denial-of-service and spoofing attacks with only 1,000 data instead of learning with about 200,000 data in the existing supervised learning model."
Anomaly Detecting Geometric Transformation Network with Outlier Exposure Defect Inspection of Real Industrial Data,2023,"['Deep learning', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'Anomaly detection', 'Out-of-distribution detection', 'Image classification']",,"Anomaly detection is one of the innovative deep learning (DL) technologies being actively applied in various industrial fields. Among them, the supervised learning approach for anomaly detection requires a large amount of normal and abnormal data. However, in real industrial situations, obtaining abnormal data can be very expensive and difficult. Therefore, in this paper, we used just normal data in a semi-supervised learning approach. 72 geometric transformations of the input sample were added to train a DL network, and to classify the transformation type using the trained network. The proposed method was applied to detect mechanical part defects on an automobile industry production line. Because it is difficult to obtain enough abnormal data in the same region of interest (ROI), to improve classification performance, a method called outlier exposal is suggested, in which the normal data in another ROI is added as abnormal data for training. Abnormal data creates a uniform distribution in the output of the network so that the class of the prediction does not belong to any kind of normal data class. Abnormal data acts the anomaly detector to be generalized more and to increase the anomaly score for new abnormal data. Experimental results verified the proposed method improved performance compared to the conventional approach."

To collect real-time images while the robot was moving, a self-developed image acquisition device using a mono camera and a Jetson board was installed on the weeding robot. Data analysis and deep learning were performed using Python, PyTorch and Torchvision. A weakly supervised learning approach was used for bean detection and a class activation map method was used for deep learning training. The layout was designed to achieve variable automatic weeding, where the weed control unit would rotate at a certain angle to avoid damaging the plant when the bean plant was detected in the real-time image captured by the robot's camera. The training results of the deep learning model showed that the accuracy and loss of the model converged with repeated training, and the recall rate was 0.85. The recognition accuracy of the bean plant area was confirmed to be 95.2%.

During the initial stages of war, the AI model must classify enemy weapon systems in states different from what it was trained on because of factors such as camouflage and changes in attached armaments.

The proposed damage detection method uses bridge response data (acceleration and displacement data) from various damage scenarios within a simply supported girder bridge subjected to a two-axle moving vehicle load. As for semi-supervised learning, we used a one-class convolutional neural network (OC-CNN) model. This model combines a one-class (OC) classification algorithm with a simple one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) configuration. The performance of the proposed OC-CNN model was evaluated through a numerical example of a vehicle-bridge coupling system. The proposed OC-CNN model trained using acceleration data showed promising results for different vehicle weights and speeds. These results offer confidence in using the prediction error loss of the proposed OC-CNN model as an ideal damage-sensitive feature for rapid bridge damage detection. In addition, the Gaussian process used in the DI can classify the prediction error losses resulting from the change induced by different damage severities (10%, 20%, and 30%) and different types of damage scenarios (single damage, double damages, and multiple damages). These results emphasize the potential of the proposed damage detection method to monitor the state of bridges in practical engineering."

To resolve this issue, we propose a supervised learning method to improve accuracy of the noise review filtering for the places with insufficient reviews. In the proposed method, training is not performed by an individual place, but by a group including several places with similar characteristics. The classifier obtained through the training can be used for the noise review filtering of an arbitrary place belonging to the group, so the problem of insufficient training data can be resolved. To verify the proposed method, a noise review filtering model was implemented using LSTM and BERT, and filtering accuracy was checked through experiments using real data collected online.

A total of 3,046 people (1,603 male students and 1,415 female students) participated in the survey. Latent profile analysis was performed to classify the latent class, and multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the influencing factors for each class.Results  First, when comprehensively considering the number of latent class cases, the 5 class classification model was judged to be the most appropriate model. Second, gender did not have a significant effect on class classification in most cases, but it was more likely to be included in the ‘middle and lower competency group’ than the ‘overall high competency group’ and ‘community competency imbalanced group’. Third, the higher the learning activity time, the higher the possibility of being included in the ‘higher middle competency group’, ‘overall high competency group’, and ‘unbalanced community competency group’ than the ‘overall low competency group’. The possibility of being included in the ‘lower-middle competency group’ was higher than the ‘community imbalanced competency group’. The better the teacher relationship, the higher the possibility of being included in the ‘overall high competency group’ than the ‘overall low competency group’. It was confirmed that they were more likely to be included in the ‘overall high competency group’ rather than the upper middle competency group.Conclusions  intervention of variables (learning activity time, parents, teachers, peer relationships) that affect the classification of latent classes according to the level of core competency development is required.

Therefore, there is a continuous need for research on methods for detecting content polluters. Detection methods using supervised learning techniques of machine learning such as Random Forest and Naive Bayes in the past show relatively high classification accuracy of 98% or more. However, in order to create a learning model, a process of generating training data by identifying features from original data and extracting feature values is required. The identified features represent the characteristics of the classification group well, and the greater the number of features, the higher the classification accuracy. However, the large number of identified features reduces the efficiency of generating a learning model when considering the time required to extract feature values.

However, most of the studies are limited to the takeoff and landing stages, and there are no rules specifying the cruise stage, so the cruise stage search studies are rare. At this stage, break away according to altitude and path rather than speed occur, and in this paper, we try to detect break away in altitude of cruise stage by clustering method. In the ADS-B flight data received from January to December 2019, 10% of flights from Jeju Airport to Gimpo Airport, the most frequently operated domestic flights, were sampled and studied about 4,400 flights. Through the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) model and the simple linear regression model, the slope between the trajectories was calculated to define the cruise slope, an interval that can be defined as the cruise stage. In addition, the non-similarity between flights was calculated using the distance measurements, EDR and DTW. Two cluster methods were used: PAM, Hierarchical clustering, and flights were clustered through PAM with the largest average silhouette width. An outlier was determined through a non-similar value between the center of the cluster classified through PAM and the flights within the cluster, and about 12% of flights were detected. It is expected to be able to prevent aviation accidents by detecting altitude break away, one of the premonitory signs, earlier. In subsequent studies, outlier detection can be carried out using a Semi-supervised learning method to detect outliers based on normal data collected with the help of experts in the aviation field."

However, it is difficult to solve the change 1) in the sensor domain caused by heterogeneous LiDAR sensors and 2) in the environmental domain caused by different environmental factors. We overcome domain differences in the semi-supervised setting with 3-stage model parameter training. First, we pre-train the model with the source dataset with object scaling based on statistics of the object size. Then we fine-tine the partially frozen model weights with copy-and-paste augmentation. The 3D points in the box labels are copied from one scene and pasted to the other scenes. Finally, we use the knowledge distillation method to update the student network with a moving average from the teacher network along with a self-training method with pseudo labels. Test-Time Augmentation with varying z values is employed to predict the final results. Our method achieved 3rd place in ECCV 2022 workshop on the 3D Perception for Autonomous Driving challenge."

The autoencoder is a representative model used for anomaly detection. An autoencoder first learns the features of normal data, and then determines data that greatly deviate from the the learned features as anomalous data. In order to learn the features of normal data, an autoencoder needs a large amount of data labeled as normal. However, it is usually not easy to obtain a large amount of labeled data. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method that utilizes even unlabeled data to train an autoencoder, which is based on the meta pseudo labeling. The proposed method selects data that is predicted as normal from unlabeled data and additionally uses them to train an autoencoder. Consequently, the proposed method can improve the performance of anomaly detection by using unlabeled data even in an environment where there are not much labeled data. Through experiments using two real datasets, we confirmed that the proposed method detects anomalies more accurately than the existing anomaly detection techniques."

Different from the existing jamming utilization techniques that harvest energy from the jamming signal as a power supply, our proposed method can take the jamming signal as a favorable factor for frequency detection. Specifically, we design an intelligent differential frequency hopping communication framework (IDFH), which contains two stages of training and communication. We first adopt supervised learning to get the jamming rule during the training stage when the synchronizing sequence is sent. And then, we utilize the jamming rule to improve the frequency detection during the communication stage when the real payload is sent. Simulation results show that the proposed method successfully combated high-speed reactive jamming with different parameters. And the communication performance increases as the power of the jamming signal increase, hence the jamming signal can help users communicate in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment."

Machine learning was performed to test the classification performance using the neural network, support vector machine, and logistic regression model among the supervised models. Results analyzed using global cost and RMSE for hip, knee, and ankle joints showed a statistically significant difference between genders in global cost and RMSE for hip and knee joints but not for ankle joints using RMSE. Considering both area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and F1-score, the logistic regression model has been evaluated as the most suitable for gender classification using the global cost or RMSE.

Research participants for qualitative research selected 4 sports leader research participants and 8 athletes research participants according to the purposeful sampling method, and collected data through semi-structured in-depth interviews. The research contents were explored through coding techniques. As a result of the study, first, there was a difference in perception according to the values of the leader and the player. The leader’s position attempted to teach “patience,” and the player expressed distress over the leader’s “force.” Second, it is the difference in perception in the training situation. In particular, the player complained that the teacher did not recognize him even though he was doing his best in a difficult training situation, while the leader considered him quite a babyhead and goofy, showing a difference in perception between them. Third, it is the difference in perception according to the characteristics of the leader and the player. Both the leader and the player showed differences caused by differences in personality and disposition or temperament as one equal person. Fourth, in other situations, there was a difference in perception due to gender differences and differences in perception according to generations. In conclusion, the leader suggested what to try to collect all the player’s information, learn various teaching behaviors (teaching methods), constantly research and study the latest coaching methods, and what leaders’ know-how should be shared."

However, the current design guideline of South Korea assumes a uniform threshold of wind speed or vibrational amplitude to assess the occurrence of harmful vibrations, potentially overlooking the complex vibrational patterns observed in long-span bridges. In this study, we propose a pointwise vortex-induced vibration (VIV) detection method using a deep-learning-based signalsegmentation model. Departing from conventional supervised methods of data acquisition and manual labeling, we synthesize training data by generating sinusoidal waves with an envelope to accurately represent VIV. A Fourier synchrosqueezed transform is leveraged to extract time-frequency features, which serve as input data for training a bidirectional long short-term memory model. The effectiveness of the model trained on synthetic VIV data is demonstrated through a comparison with its counterpart trained on manually labeled real datasets from an actual cable-supported bridge."
P-Triple Barrier Labeling: Unifying Pair Trading Strategies and Triple Barrier Labeling Through Genetic Algorithm Optimization,2023,"['Pair Trading', 'Triple Barrier Labeling', 'AI', 'Genetic Algorithm', 'Labeling Method.']",,"In the ever-changing landscape of finance, the fusion of artificial intelligence (AI)and pair trading strategies has captured the interest of investors and institutions alike. In the context of supervised machine learning, crafting precise and accurate labels is crucial, as it remains a top priority to empower AI models to surpass traditional pair trading methods. However, prevailing labeling techniques in the financial sector predominantly concentrate on individual assets, posing a challenge in aligning with pair trading strategies. To address this issue, we propose an inventive approach that melds the Triple Barrier Labeling technique with pair trading, optimizing the resultant labels through genetic algorithms. Rigorous backtesting on cryptocurrency datasets illustrates that our proposed labeling method excels over traditional pair trading methods and corresponding buy-and-hold strategies in both profitability and risk control. This pioneering method offers a novel perspective on trading strategies and risk management within the financial domain, laying a robust groundwork for further enhancing the precision and reliability of pair trading strategies utilizing AI models."
A Study of Middle School Library Remodeling Design  through User Participation,2023,"['School Library', 'Middle School', 'User Participatory and Customized Design', 'School Space Innovation', 'Remodeling', '학교도서관', '중학교', '사용자참여디자인', '학교공간혁신사업', '리모델링']",,"(Background and Purpose) The role of the library in school is not only a storage of knowledge information, but also a cultural space, and the new curriculum requires a change to an learning support space. Most of the middle and high school libraries so far have been remodeled from the existing standardized classroom space and arranged uniformly, so they have not been able to respond to these changes. In order to provide a library space that reflects the characteristics of the school and the needs of the students in a limited space that varies depending on the situation of the school, a user participation design process is needed more than any other space. The purpose of this study is to propose a library design that meets the needs of users and fits the characteristics of Y Middle School, which is conducted as the Dream Classroom Project through a user participatory design. (Method) The first step is to understand the Dream Classroom project and analysis the examples of libraries that have been completed by the project. Second step is to identify user needs and generate initial design ideas through surveys, classroom meetings and brainstorming workshop. Third, the design is developed through design workshops and committee meetings reflecting users’ opinions. Finally, the design is constructed through the construction document and the design supervision process. (Results) The design direction of the subject school library derived through the user participatory design process is as follows. First, the design proposes to convert a space that was previously used as various spaces into a library, giving it a sense of unity and making it recognizable as a single space. Second, the arched bookshelves are applied along the walls and windows, leaving the center open to accommodate diverse learning and cultural activities to meet the needs of users. Third, the library is designed to accommodate the diverse needs of users by presenting reading spaces of various sizes to meet the characteristics of libraries where learning takes place at various scales, including individual, small group, and group activities. Finally, the library is designed to bring in ample natural light creating a bright and open ambiance, which is the user's request. (Conclusions) In this study, a design customized to the characteristics of the subject school is derived through the design process of school library remodeling through user participation design. This is expected to increase the utilization rate by making the library a psychologically and environmentally intimate space as well as providing convenience of use for the users who participated. The library design process through user participatory design recorded in this study will serve as a guideline of improvement planning for school libraries in the future."
A Novel Two-Stage Training Method for Unbiased Scene Graph Generation via Distribution Alignment,2023,"['Scene Graph Generation', 'Transformer-based Architecture', 'Distribution Alignment', 'Model-independent', 'Visual Genome Dataset.']",,"Scene graphs serve as semantic abstractions of images and play a crucial role in enhancing visual comprehension and reasoning. However, the performance of Scene Graph Generation is often compromised when working with biased data in real-world situations. While many existing systems focus on a single stage of learning for both feature extraction and classification, some employ Class-Balancing strategies, such as Re-weighting, Data Resampling, and Transfer Learning from head to tail. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that decouples the feature extraction and classification phases of the scene graph generation process. For feature extraction, we leverage a transformer-based architecture and design an adaptive calibration function specifically for predicate classification. This function enables us to dynamically adjust the classification scores for each predicate category. Additionally, we introduce a Distribution Alignment technique that effectively balances the class distribution after the feature extraction phase reaches a stable state, thereby facilitating the retraining of the classification head. Importantly, our Distribution Alignment strategy is model-independent and does not require additional supervision, making it applicable to a wide range of SGG models. Using the scene graph diagnostic toolkit on Visual Genome and several popular models, we achieved significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art methods with our model. Compared to the TDE model, our model improved mR@100 by 70.5% for PredCls, by 84.0% for SGCls, and by 97.6% for SGDet tasks."

The positive effects of artificial intelligence inevitably come with a certain price due to its nature. Artificial intelligence uses intelligent capabilities to rapidly analyze and process large data sets to make predictions through learning and reasoning. The accuracy of prediction increases in proportion to the scale of data or information about private life, including personal information. As a result, a large amount of information processing is allowed, which increases the risk of invasion of privacy, and raises issues of data quality including the bias of the data set. There is also a risk that the bias that exists in reality can be reflected as it is and the prejudice can be fixed. Also, the inherent opacity of artificial intelligence itself further exacerbates concerns about these issues and makes it difficult to correct errors or damages. These negative effects are embodied in the possibility of disregarding human dignity and autonomy, the risk of invasion of privacy and the advent of a surveillance society, and the risk of violating the right to equality.In order to respond to these risks, it is important to ensure transparency while premising on the anthropocentric thinking that artificial intelligence is only valuable when it benefits humans and society. This foundation is in line with the constitutional rule of law. Therefore, even in the case of using artificial intelligence in the social security field, a clearer legal basis for the grounds for use, the range and method of data that can be processed, and the retention period of data must be established. In addition, efforts to improve the system itself, such as eligibility for benefits, the level of social security benefits, and the possibility of overlapping or unfair payments, by thoroughly analyzing the causes of blind spots or illegal receipts, and efforts to promote changes in social awareness should be prioritized. The use of artificial intelligence has a significant impact on the right to self-determination of personal information or the privacy and freedom of privacy. Relevant legislation should seek measures to minimize restrictions on fundamental rights, such as placing certain limits on the scope, period, and frequency of data or information that can be processed. In order to ensure follow-up supervision and the possibility of raising practical objections, related information disclosure and notification, and easily accessible dispute resolution procedures should also be in place."

This study applies random forest methodology, a supervised machine learning algorithm with correlation and multiple regression analyses to conduct multifaceted analysis. The random forest method is an intuitive and highly accurate algorithm to improve understanding of phenomena and produce meaningful results. Upon analyzing the macroeconomic determinants for air transport performance from 2002 to 2019, the results show GDP, government bond rates, and the KOSPI index have high positive correlations with air passenger demand and air cargo demand. Multiple regression analysis results confirmed that GDP and employement rate have a significant influence on air transport performance. Macroeconomic indicators have more explanatory power for air passenger demand, WTI and won/dollar exchange rate are also significantly influencing the passenger demand. Random forest analysis results demonstrate that WTI, won/dollar exchange rate, consumer sentiment index, GDP, and yen/won exchange rate are highly significant in air passenger demand. It is confirmed yen/won exchange rate variable emerges as a significant determinant of air passenger demand since 2013.

"Black-box Medicine with AI/ML Technology Regulation: Clinical Roles, Relations, and Risks",2023,"['Artificial intelligence', 'black box', 'medicine', 'FDA', 'KFDA', '인공지능', '블랙박스', '의약품', 'FDA', '식약청']",,"This study discusses the issues with black-box medicine, including the challenges or barriers to fostering trust in artificial intelligence systems for their eventual integration, use, and adoption in medical settings. It also explores potential medical liabilities such as legal and ethical issues, which are novel and unresolved in terms of potential errors or harms caused by artificial intelligence diagnoses or treatment recommendations. Finally, these subjects also necessitate a brief examination of changing physician roles, in that black-box algorithms will eventually affect the relationships between patient and physicians when artificial intelligence becomes capable of simulating, assisting, or replacing traditionally human physician tasks. Technological advances in the form of black-box medicine as well as artificial intelligence generally and machine learning continue to affect regulatory frameworks and perceived risks. Regarding the implementation of these tools in medical devices, there is a need for greater clarity to ensure safety for patients while also being responsive to claims of efficacy or utility. Specifically, increasing the explanatory power of these technologies in the course of medical artificial intelligence development also furthers these twin goals. Technology usage for general scientific applications like drug discovery further highlights the potentially pervasive effects of black-box medicine on overall human health. At the same, separate issues arise concerning broader artificial intelligence safety and related areas such as bias far beyond mere medical outcomes. These uncertainties are by no means easily resolved, and they require the careful deliberation of interdisciplinary analysis drawing from legal, medical, and other expert backgrounds. In particular, it is necessary for lawmakers and regulators to be knowledgeable about the clinical impact of these tools as well as their impact on standard industry norms for policy goals . While the rapid development of new artificial intelligence models continues to improve human health, there are ongoing risks involved with regard to the way that decisions are made. Although unsupervised learning from artificial intelligence in medicine presents an opportunity, safety and other issues may mitigate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based studies by clinicians in the absence of additional protections. Reassuring patients as well as clinicians about artificial intelligence safety is imperative and promotes debate about the necessity of supporting or replacing clinical judgment in a healthcare context. This tension between human users and the new models as utilized in treatment underscores the idea that these technologies have the potential to either supplant human skills or augment them, depending on the needs of the medical setting. United States and Korean regulations also suggest that at the level of algorithms in black-box medicine, additional scrutiny may be warranted. Concerns about the opaqueness or black-box nature of an algorithm itself also give rise to calls for interpretability and developer awareness. Rapid product improvement with effective safeguards and pre-market approval prompt additional areas of analysis as medicine and other areas of science strive to balance the goal of enhancing medicine with the underlying nature of black-box medicine as algorithms which may not be capable of perfect transparency. In summary, black-box medicine suggests a new challenge in medicine which also begets opportunities. However, it also calls for detailed supervision in policy and practice with sound methodologies both to assure its ethical deployment and to foster trust towards innovative medical technologies."

In particular, high evaluation score and fast processing speed are attained by using clustered sense labels for WSD model. This study proposes a method to improve further the quality of clustered sense labels by using basic language resources instead of other costly language resources such as thesaurus. The method uses the category of lexical senses to initialize the sense label clusters more appropriately, and uses the context information of raw texts to improve the quality of sense vectors for clustering. We made clustered sense labels using proposed method and applied them to BERT-based WSD model. As a result of experiment, it showed that the performance of our model is F1 70.6%, which is higher than F1 69.1% the one of the existing model not using our method. Therefore, it showed that the quality of clustered sense labels can be improved by using basic language resources."

This paper revisits the experimental results of botnet detection using autoencoder, a semi-supervised deep learning model, for UGR and CTU-13 data sets. To prepare the input vectors of autoencoder, we create data points by grouping the NetFlow records into sliding windows based on source IP address and aggregating them to form features. In particular, we discover a simple power-law; that is the number of data points that have some flow-degree is proportional to the number of NetFlow records aggregated in them. Moreover, we show that our power-law fits the real data very well resulting in correlation coefficients of 97% or higher. We also show that this power-law has an impact on the learning of autoencoder and, as a result, influences the performance of botnet detection. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of autoencoder using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve."

In the financial industry, even if the performance of the new predictive models is excellent, it should be accompanied by an intuitive explanation of the basis on which the result was determined. Recently, the US, EU, and South Korea have commonly presented the right to request explanations of algorithms, so transparency in the use of AI in the financial sector must be secured. In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based interpretable classification prediction model was proposed using corporate bankruptcy data that was open to the outside world. First, data preprocessing, 5-fold cross-validation, etc. were performed, and classification performance was compared through optimization of 10 supervised learning classification models such as logistic regression, SVM, XGBoost, and LightGBM. As a result, LightGBM was confirmed as the best performance model, and SHAP, an explainable artificial intelligence technique, was applied to provide a post-explanation of the bankruptcy prediction process."
Noninvasive In-Vivo Estimation of Blood-Glucose Concentration Using Beer-Lambert-Based Model,2023,"['Blood-glucose concentration', 'In-vivo estimation', 'Noninvasive measurement', 'Beer-Lambert law', 'Photoplethysmography']",,"Noninvasive measurement of blood-glucose concentration can reduce both pain and complications associated with piercing the human fingertip to collect blood. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a helpful technique that can be used to measure blood-glucose concentration without a blood sample. To facilitate such noninvasive in-vivo estimation, we propose a model based on the Beer-Lambert law for measuring blood-glucose concentration using the PPG signal. Notably, only two wavelengths are used. First, the oxygen saturation (SpO2) is estimated from the ratio of absorbance at two wavelengths, then another absorbance ratio is presented, and the blood-glucose concentration is estimated by substituting the SpO2 estimated earlier to this ratio. The PPG signals from 40 subjects were collected along with their reference blood-glucose concentrations and SpO2 values. The PPG-based blood-glucose concentrations are then calculated using mathematical equations derived from the Beer-Lambert law. A supervised machine learning model, XGBoost, is applied to calibrate the estimation model with the reference values measured using a commercial device; according to our experimental results, the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) value is 0.85. The proposed model based on the Beer-Lambert law thus provides a method for in-vivo estimation of blood glucose in daily applications."

The greatest breakthrough of his like was that he corrections made on his compilation writings on Yi Hwang and acknowledged of his accomplishment. In addition, he practiced utmost filial duty to have his name known as the most representative man of filial duty throughout his hometown.On the sound foundation of academic and social heritage of Park Woon, he engaged with reputable family of Yeongnam, and produced the so-called ‘Samjegudang’ up to the present generation to stand tall as a reputable clan to represent Seonsan. In addition, it is also blessed with the economic power with numerous slaves and land. Such a background is sufficient to be the cause to engage in various clan activities by the Yongam Clan.The exaltation project of Park Woon involved in encouraging the filial deeds in the 16th century, enshrinement of Nakbongseowon in the 17th century, change of name from the filial man to the master or teacher in the 18th century, publication of 󰡔Yongammunjip󰡕, clearance of relevant relic site and so on.

However, the performance of anomaly detection algorithms is generally evaluated on publicly available datasets, and the specific performance of each algorithm on anomalies of particular types remains unexplored. Consequently, selecting an appropriate anomaly detection algorithm for specific analytical contexts poses challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to investigate the types of anomalies and various attributes of data. Subsequently, we intend to propose approaches that can assist in the selection of appropriate anomaly detection algorithms based on this understanding. Specifically, this study compares the performance of anomaly detection algorithms for four types of anomalies: local, global, contextual, and clustered anomalies. Through further analysis, the impact of label availability, data quantity, and dimensionality on algorithm performance is examined. Experimental results demonstrate that the most effective algorithm varies depending on the type of anomaly, and certain algorithms exhibit stable performance even in the absence of anomaly-specific information. Furthermore, in some types of anomalies, the performance of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms was observed to be lower than that of supervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. Lastly, we found that the performance of most algorithms is more strongly influenced by the type of anomalies when the data quantity is relatively scarce or abundant. Additionally, in cases of higher dimensionality, it was noted that excellent performance was exhibited in detecting local and global anomalies, while lower performance was observed for clustered anomaly types."

In particular, we focus on the tendency of young adults in their 20s, who have been highlighted as a new political force, to be consumed by gender-based political conflicts, and capture how the media limited the complex agenda attributes of the 'Men and Women in their 20s' agenda to gender-conflicting issues in the 20s. First, we conducted topic modeling on 3,431 relevant news articles to identify agenda attributes, and extracted detailed topics of the 'Men and Women in their 20s' agenda and clustered them based on policy-social agenda attributes and male-female agenda attributes. Most of the extracted topics were related to the campaigns of political candidates in the 20th presidential election, confirming the consumption of 'Men and Women in their 20s' in a political context. Next, we analyzed the composition of gender frames in the coverage of the 'Men and Women in their 20s' agenda through an automated text classification algorithm. We, then, examined the effect of agenda attributes on three gender frames: gender issue analysis frame, gender representation frame, and gender conflict frame, and found that among the agenda attributes of 'Men and Women in their 20s', the female-policy agenda attribute 'female quota system', the male-social agenda attribute 'man-hating controversy', and the male-policy agenda attribute 'soldier meals' had a significant positive effect on the use of gender conflict frame. Moreover, at the agenda attribute level, only the female-policy attribute was positively correlated with the gender conflict frame, unlike other agenda attributes, suggesting that women-oriented policy issues tend to be limited to social conflict and controversy. On the other hand, when it comes to the relationship between agenda attributes and gender representation frame, we found that the 'Men in their 20s' are represented as a group attacking feminism and a far-right populist image, while the 'Women in their 20s' are represented as a socially vulnerable group such as victims of crime and a group opposing discrimination against women. We also found that the new media reported male-policy agenda attributes, such as the 'soldier meals' topic, or female-policy agenda attributes, such as the 'female quota system' topic, in a gender-conflicted manner, turning the issue into a kind of gender confrontation by associating election promises for young people with a specific gender. The theoretical contribution of this study is that it examined the relationship between news agendas and gender-related frames based on attribute agenda-setting theory and frame theory, and explored a research method that combines topic modeling and supervised machine learning at the research methodological level."

(Results) The results obtained through the project processes are summarized as follows. First, in the case of color planning for educational facilities, it is necessary to investigate increases or decreases in classes, already invested facilities, and future environmental improvement projects during the preliminary preparation process. In the case of exterior color planning, the surrounding environmental color should be investigated for both the target and nearby buildings to secure color harmony. In the case of interior color planning, studying the surrounding environmental color is optional. Second, color-based educational workshops should be planned considering the user characteristics and learning competencies of elementary and middle school students, and various activity sheets should be developed to increase completeness in a short process. To provide as many color experiences as possible to the workshop participants, color paper for professional colorists and new education tools, such as a smart pad sketchbook application to allow students to experience digital coloring, should be used, as well as existing coloring tools. Third, according to the architectural interior and exterior color planning process, color education and workshops should be organized through an overall status study, color selection according to the color concept, the creation of a color scheme list according to the application area of the primary and secondary colors of the space, and direct coloring activities in the target space. (Conclusion) It is expected that the architectural color target and user-customized color education workshop data can be used as materials for color experts, and it is necessary to introduce new education tools according to future technological developments."
