A Decision Tree Approach to Develop Price Prediction Rules for Korea Allowance Unit and Renewable Energy Certificate,2023,"['Net Zero', 'RPS', 'REC', 'KAU', 'Carbon Credit', 'Price Prediction', 'Data Mining', 'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest']",,"This study attempted to analyze and predict the market prices related to carbon credit and REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) in the age of Net Zero response to the climate crisis. Although the price volatility of carbon credit-related securities is less than that of stock prices, the volatility is still high on a monthly basis. KAU and REC transaction data were extracted from Korea Power Exchange (KPX). The data used for dependent variables in the analysis is the seven-year data from 2015 to 2022. Macroscopic variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and international oil prices were used as independent variables to predict transaction prices. Through decision tree analysis, a model with excellent performance by algorithm and parameter combination was first selected. As a result, the random forest generally shows higher performance than C4.5. However, parameters were adjusted in order to utilize C4.5, which has strengths in schematization of decision trees compared to random forests, and a model with a predictive rate comparable to that of random forests was selected. This paper suggests a schematic decision tree of KAU and REC in the preliminary experiment and could derive some decison rules to get optimal decision. This study has contributions in the following points. Several independent variables that affect carbon credits and REC price fluctuations were found. From this, we could draw the influence relationship between the target variable and the main independent variables. In addition, we could draw schematic diagrams that derive major rules and patterns through the decision tree method, moreover, it was possible to conduct multi-dimensional analysis for price prediction rather than mathematical modeling techniques."

Conclusion: In order to reduce BID, there is a need to develop a customized BID education and management programs."
Decision tree model to efficiently optimize the process conditions of carbonaceous mesophase prepared with coal tar,2023,['Decision tree model Process optimization Carbonaceous mesophases Coal tar Machine learning technology'],,"It is difficult to optimize the process parameters of directly preparing carbonaceous mesophase (CMs) by solvothermal method using coal tar as raw material. To solve this problem, a Decision Tree model for CMs preparation (DTC) was established based on the relationship between the process parameters and the yields of CMs. Then, the importance of variables in the preparation process for CMs was predicted, the relationship between experimental conditions and yields was revealed, and the preparation process conditions were also optimized by the DTC. The prediction results showed that the importance of the variables was raw material type, solvothermal temperature, solvothermal time, solvent amount, and additive type in order. And the optimized reaction conditions were as follows: coal tar was pretreated by decompress distillation and centrifugation, the solvent amount was 50.0 ml, the solvothermal temperature was 230 °C, and the reaction time was 5 h. These prediction results were consistent with the actual experimental results, and the error between the predicted yields and the actual yields was about − 1.1%. Furthermore, the prediction error of DTC method was within the acceptable range when the data sample sets were reduced to 100 sets. These results proved that the established DTC for chemical process optimization can effectively lessen the experimental workload and has high application value."

Different machine learning techniques involving larger data set should be warranted for future research and development."
Enhanced Signal Classifier for Speech/Audio Coding by Binary Decision Tree,2023,"['Signal classifier', 'Speech/audio coding', 'CART', 'MDCT', 'CELP', 'G.718']",,"Various researches are being conducted on an integrated speech/audio coder capable of handling both speech and audio signals. However, since the speech and the audio signals have different characteristics, it is difficult to process them with a single coder. Therefore, instead of coding the speech and the audio with only one coder, a method of coding the speech with a speech coder and the audio with an audio coder was adopted, and an integrated speech/audio coder combining the speech and the audio coders was developed. That is, after signal classification is performed on the input signal, the speech is coded by the speech coder and the audio is coded by the audio coder. G.718 is a representative speech/audio coder that uses a signal classifier using modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) energy ratio to classify input signals into the speech and the audio and then codes the input signals. However, since the signal classifier of G.718 performs a simple signal classification using a single parameter, the performance of the speech/audio signal classifier is not good, resulting in degradation of the overall performance of the speech/audio coder. Therefore, in this paper, a speech/audio signals classifier for the frame-by frame signal coding by a new decision rule is proposed. In the proposed classification, various time and frequency domain features are extracted. To design an optimized speech/audio classifier, the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm is utilized and a binary decision tree is constructed. The performance of the proposed classifier with the various features is compared with that of the G.718 with the ratio between the MDCT power ratio of the input and the code-excited linear prediction (CELP) coder output signal. Experimental results show that the classification rates of the proposed algorithm are higher than those of the classifiers in G.718."
Ensemble Gene Selection Method Based on Multiple Tree Models,2023,"['Ensemble Tree Model', 'Gradient Boosting Decision Tree', 'Gene Selection', 'ID3', 'Random Forest']",,"Identifying highly discriminating genes is a critical step in tumor recognition tasks based on microarray geneexpression profile data and machine learning. Gene selection based on tree models has been the subject ofseveral studies. However, these methods are based on a single-tree model, often not robust to ultra-highdimensionalmicroarray datasets, resulting in the loss of useful information and unsatisfactory classificationaccuracy. Motivated by the limitations of single-tree-based gene selection, in this study, ensemble gene selectionmethods based on multiple-tree models were studied to improve the classification performance of tumoridentification. Specifically, we selected the three most representative tree models: ID3, random forest, andgradient boosting decision tree. Each tree model selects top-n genes from the microarray dataset based on itsintrinsic mechanism. Subsequently, three ensemble gene selection methods were investigated, namely multipletreemodel intersection, multiple-tree module union, and multiple-tree module cross-union, were investigated.Experimental results on five benchmark public microarray gene expression datasets proved that the multipletree module union is significantly superior to gene selection based on a single tree model and other competitivegene selection methods in classification accuracy."
GOBT: A Synergistic Approach to Game AI Using Goal-Oriented and Utility-Based Planning in Behavior Trees,2023,"['Behavior Tree', 'GOAP', 'Utility System', 'Artificial Intelligence.']",,"In this paper, we propose a novel game AI framework, the Goal-Oriented Behavior Tree, using Unity game engine for simulations. This framework integrates the advantages of the Goal-Oriented Action Planning architecture and Utility Theory with traditional Behavior Trees, enabling more flexible agent responses to various situations. The simulated environment contains customizable game characters capable of actions like patrol, attack, retreat etc. GOBT allows developers to design agent decision-making processes by applying logic in traditional BTs and using the dynamic planning capabilities of GOAP and utility-based action selection when necessary. The performance of GOBT  frame-work is verified through simulations using a synthetic dataset of agent behaviors in response to changing environmental factors."
Research on reliability of centrifugal compressor unit based on dynamic Bayesian network of fault tree mapping,2023,['· Centrifugal compressor unit · Dynamic bayesian network · Fault tree · K-means model · Reliability analysis'],,"For the first time, the fault tree mapping dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) method is applied to the reliability research study of centrifugal compressor units, and its usability and reliability are evaluated dynamically. First, the fault data using the K-means method eliminates abnormal data and builds a fault tree model. The structure is mapped to the DBN structure to complete the structure learning, and the logic gate is mapped to the conditional probability to achieve the parameter learning. Then the model is solved bidirectionally. The change rule of system node reliability with time is solved forward, and the posterior probability of the system node is solved reversely to complete fault diagnosis. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation analysis and the Markov process verify the dynamic reliability and steady-state availability.The results show that the Monte Carlo simulation method is almost consistent with the reliability prediction curve of the DBN model. Indicating that the accuracy of the DBN model is reliable and the computational efficiency is improved by about 81434 times. The steady-state availability calculated using the DBN model is approximately 0.99963, which is close to reality compared to the Markov process. This method can better describe centrifugal compressor units’ dynamic reliability and maintainability and provide decision support for regular maintenance of essential parts and enterprise procurement."

The second significant factor was habitual use and age, as more frequent use led to a higher likelihood of subscribing to paid streaming services for younger users.Regarding RQ2, Age was identified as the most influential factor in multiple subscriptions and the second factor was split based on habitual use."
"Major Decisive Factors of Tropical Cyclone Risk in the Republic of Korea: Intensity, Track, and Extratropical Transition",2023,['Tropical cyclone · Extratropical transition · Damage · Risk · Decision tree'],,"After the catastrophic damage caused by the extratropical transitioned North Atlantic hurricane Sandy (2012), the decayingstage of a tropical cyclone (TC) have received more attention. TC undergoing extratropical transition (ET) in mid-latitudesmay become hazardous with torrential rain and violent wind over a vast area. In this study, a decision tree analysis wasapplied to evaluate the relative importance of TC parameters such as intensity category, entry location, and distance fromcoastlines, in determining damage occurrence. All 123 landfalling TCs in the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea) during1979–2015 were analyzed. The results reveal that intense TCs (severe tropical storms and typhoons) incur damages regardlessof entry location and distance from coastlines. TCs with tropical storm intensity are expected to incur damages only whenthey approach the southwest of the Korean Peninsula. Weak TC with maximum wind speeds smaller than 17 m s−1 does nothave the potential to incur damages unless the TC was undergoing extratropical transition (ET) during landfall in Korea. ETstorms that make a landfall approaching 1.22° (~130 km) to the coastline cause substantial damages especially in the westcoast and capital area of Korea. The present results suggest that accurate forecasting that also considers ET, and not onlyintensity and track, is essential for successful disaster risk mitigation."
"결정 트리를 가지고 불완전한 데이터를 처리하기 위한 두 분류기의 비교 : C4.5, SVM",2023,"['C4.5', 'Decision tree', 'Incomplete data', 'Mean value', 'Missing value', 'SVM']",,"This paper introduces an algorithm to obtain an estimate of the missing value from incomplete data using decision trees. As a classifier to construct a decision tree, C4.5 and SVM series algorithms with different characteristics are used, and the characteristics and performance of the two classifiers are examined through the implementation process. The decision tree is selected as a handling technique for incomplete data because each node of the decision tree has the classification information (hyperplane) of the input patterns, and the path from the root to the terminal node combines the hyperplanes to form a single domain. Therefore, the key idea of this paper for incomplete data is to enter the missing event in the root and find the area most similar to the missing information through traversal. Then, an estimate of the missing information is obtained from the events in this domain. From the implementation point of view, the training data is divided into lossy data and non-lossy data, and the decision tree is completed by inputting the non-lossy data into C4.5/SVM. Next, after inputting the loss data into this decision tree, the traversal is repeated until reaching the terminal node according to the condition for finding the most similar property."

Neural network models are often evaluated to be superior to existing statistical models in terms of estimation or prediction accuracy. However, there is ambiguity in determining the input feature of the input layer of the neural network model, that is, the type and number of input features, and decision trees are sometimes used to overcome these disadvantages.In this paper, we evaluate the existing methods of using decision trees and propose the method of using decision trees to prioritize input feature selection in neural network models. This can be a complementary or combined analysis method of the neural network model and decision tree, and the validity was confirmed by applying the proposed method to house price estimation. Through several comparisons, it has been summarized that the selection of appropriate input characteristics according to priority can increase the estimation power of the model."

The data were analyzed using a complex-sample t-test, the Rao Scott χ2 -test, and the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm for decision tree analysis with SPSS v. 27.0. The participants were divided into two groups, one regularly eating breakfast and the other skipping it.Results: A total of 579 and 445 study participants were found to be breakfast consumers and breakfast skippers respectively. Breakfast consumers were significantly younger than those who skipped breakfast. In addition, breakfast consumers had a significantly higher frequency of eating dinner, had been taught about nutrition, and had a lower frequency of eating out.The breakfast skippers did so to lose weight. Children who skipped breakfast consumed less energy, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, fiber, cholesterol, vitamin C, vitamin A, calcium, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, phosphorus, sodium, iron, potassium, and niacin than those who consumed breakfast. The best predictor of skipping breakfast was identifying adolescents who sought to control their weight by not eating meals. Other participants who had low and middle-low household incomes, ate dinner 3–4 times a week, were more than 14.5 years old, and ate out once a day showed a higher frequency of skipping breakfast.Conclusion: Based on these results, nutrition education targeted at losing weight correctly and emphasizing the importance of breakfast, especially for adolescents, is required.Moreover, nutrition educators should consider designing and implementing specific action plans to encourage adolescents to improve their breakfast-eating practices by also eating dinner regularly and reducing eating out."

Since the analysis results can be understood through the tree structure, it has the advantage of having high interpretation power as well as predictive power. In addition, it is used in many fields because it is able to identify nonlinear relationships between response and predictor variables. However, if the purpose of it is to predict the mode of the response variable, there is a limitation in that the previously proposed decision tree cannot be applied. Thus, we develop a new form of the modal decision tree model by integrating the kernel density estimation methods into the decision tree model. The simulation is conducted with four models. The results are compared for each size of the data when the predictor variable and the response variable are linear and nonlinear relationship cases. When the data has a linear relationship, the performance of the modal desicion tree model proposed in this paper is comparative to that of the previously proposed modal linear regression (MODLR) model. When the data has a nonlinear relationship, the performance of the modal tree model is better."

While the recent advent of low-cost air sensors has enabled real-time measurement of particulate matter, discrepancies in concentrations can arise depending on the sensor used, the measuring environment, and the manufacturer. In light of this, we aimed to propose a method to calibrate measurements between low-cost air sensor devices. In our study, we introduced decision tree techniques, commonly used in machine learning for classification and regression problems, to categorize particulate matter concentration intervals. For each interval, both univariate and multivariate multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to derive calibration equations. The concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 measured indoors and outdoors with two types of LCS equipment and the GRIMM 11-A device were compared and analyzed, confirming the necessity for distinguishing between indoor and outdoor spaces and categorizing concentration intervals. Furthermore, the decision tree calibration method showed greater accuracy than traditional methods. On the other hand, during univariate regression analysis, the proportion exceeding a PM2.5/PM10 ratio of 1 was significantly high. However, using multivariate regression analysis, the exceedance rate decreased to 79.1% for IAQ-C7 and 89.3% for PMM-130, demonstrating that calibration through multivariate regression analysis considering both PM10 and PM2.5 is more effective. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the accurate calibration of particulate matter measurements and have showcased the potential for scientifically and rationally calibrating data using machine learning."

In the environmental history of China, on the one hand, the ‘northward movement(北移)’ of rubber trees is usually criticised as an “unscientific” “political movement” in the Mao’s era, only resulting in the devastating environmental and social disasters in China. On the other hand, the official history of Chinese government has often praised the same ‘northward movement’ as the China’s supreme scientific achievement in successfully planting rubber trees at the world’s highest altitude. This study aims to reexamine such conflicting historical assessments, and to shed a new light on the relationship between science and politics in the early phase of the Mao’s regime, first, by showing both international politico-economic and environmental contexts in which such a decision was made to move rubber trees northward; second, by analyzing the experimental research on “protective forests” by a newly emerging group of agricultural meteorologists, who played a crucial role in the plantation project, and how they supported the decision. Rather than focusing on the totalitarian characteristics of the socialist state behind the rubber tree plantation, this research recovers the agency of a group of scientists experimentally supporting the plantation and their careful considerations of the relationship between strategically urgent needs of the state and natural and environmental constraints.

However, studies on seismic PSA for process plants, such as gas plants, oil refineries, and chemical plants, have been scarce. This is because the major disasters to which these process plants are vulnerable include explosions, fires, and release (or dispersion) of toxic chemicals. However, seismic PSA is essential for the plants located in regions with significant earthquake risks. Seismic PSA entails probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), event tree analysis (ETA), fault tree analysis (FTA), and fragility analysis for the structures and essential equipment items. Among those analyses, ETA can depict the accident sequence for core damage, which is the worst disaster and top event concerning NPPs. However, there is no general top event with regard to process plants. Therefore, PSA cannot be directly applied to process plants. Moreover, there is a paucity of studies on developing fragility curves for various equipment. This paper introduces PSA for gas plants based on FTA, which is then transformed into Bayesian network, that is, a probabilistic graph model that can aid risk-informed decision-making. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a gas plant, and several decision-making cases are demonstrated."

"RCP, SSP 기후변화 시나리오를 활용한 우리나라 미래 수종 분포 예측 연구",2023,"['RCP', 'SSP', 'Climate Change', 'HyTAG', 'WI', 'PEI', 'MTCI']",,"The seriousness of climate change is being discussed in various fields, including the importance of efficient afforestation and forest management as a major carbon absorption sink to help achieve the 2050 carbon neutral aim. The scheme of climate change data has been changed from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) to Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) to reflect socioeconomic land use. The SSP can be used to predict the distribution of future tree species when used with the existing Hydrological and Thermal Analogy Groups (HyTAG) model. Therefore, this study predicted potential distribution changes by tree species using RCP and SSP scenario data and compared the trends of the two scenarios to actual climate change data. For the analysis, climatic indices were constructed by period and used in the HyTAG model to predict potential distribution of tree species. Growth of needleleaf and broadleaf trees was confirmed only in the vicinity of the alpine region of Gangwon-do, with decreasing proportions of 81% (RCP 8.5) and 97% (SSP 5-8.5) in the RCP and SSP scenarios, respectively. In addition, the area of such trees decreased by 50% in the long-term (2051-2080) compared to the mid-term (2021-2050) and was nearly depleted in severe cases. Comparison of hydrological and thermal indices by climate change scenario confirmed that actual climate change was progressing faster than predicted in any climate change scenarios. These results show that forests, which are major carbon absorption sinks, are facing serious risks from rapid climate change and should be considered in decision-making on climate change adaptation measures and future afforestation strategies."

Method: In this study, using the urban flood risk mitigation model, spatial simulation analysis was performed for the city with land use/land cover map, watershed map, hydrologic soil group map, design precipitation, and biophysical data. Result: Rivers and streams in the farmland areas occupying a large area of the city and soil characteristics with poor permeability were found to act as factors that could cause farmland damage due to floods. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the distribution of urban forests by introducing vegetation such as trees to prevent flood damage. In addition, it was predicted that there is a risk of excessive runoff in areas with high development density, centered on industrial complexes in Cheongju. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an eco-industrial park that can prevent disaster and support citizen’s recreation by creating green spaces and infrastructures to store runoff water. In this way, in the decision-making process for establishing a flood risk mitigation plan and promoting related policies, ecosystem service factors that can provide benefits such as disaster prevention as well as improvement of quality, carbon capture, and air purification should be considered."

AI-Based Employment Situation Analysis of Innovative Talents in the New Media Era,2023,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Decision Tree', 'Employment Situation', 'Innovative Talents', 'New Media', 'Rough Set.']",,"As the number of undergraduates increases, competition for employment opportunities becomes more intense. To improve employment guidance and increase the employment rate and quality, it is essential to evaluate preliminary employment data, identify the primary variables that influence employment, and provide decision support for decision-makers. In the era of new media, the influx of massive information can make it difficult for undergraduates to distinguish between true and false information, making it necessary to analyze the employment situation of innovative talents using artificial intelligence. However, historical employment data is generally a dataset with high noise due to the diversity and complexity of actual employment situations. Differences in accuracy requirements among various institutions also make handling issues such as different accuracy requirements and noise adaptation abilities challenging. To address this issue, this study proposes applying a decision tree algorithm based on a multi-scale rough set model to analyze university employment data. By introducing the multiscale concept into rough set theory and drawing on variable precision rough sets, the analysis's accuracy and noise adaptation ability can be improved. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of classification accuracy and running time, and the employment situation of creative minds can be effectively analyzed. Moreover, the decision tree has a simple structure, concise rules, no inseparable datasets, and a fast running speed."

Consequently, this incident has aroused great interest in the safety of nuclear power plants worldwide. A reasonable safety evaluation of such an external event should appropriately consider the correlation between SSCs (structures, systems, and components) and the probability of failure. However, a probabilistic safety assessment in current nuclear industries is performed conservatively, assuming that the failure correlation between SSCs is independent or completely dependent. This is an extreme assumption; a reasonable risk can be calculated, or risk-based decision-making can be conducted only when the appropriate failure correlation between SSCs is considered. Thus, this study analyzed the effect of the failure correlation of SSCs on the safety of the system to realize rational safety assessment and decision-making. Consequently, the impact on the system differs according to the size of the failure probability of the SSCs and the AND and OR conditions."

3D 프린팅 소재 화학물질의 독성 예측을 위한 Data-centric XAI 기반 분자 구조 Data Imputation과 QSAR 모델 개발,2023,"['3D printing', 'Data imputation', 'Explainable AI (XAI)', 'Quantitative-structure activity relationship (QSAR)', 'Data-centric AI', 'Computational toxicology']",,"As accessibility to 3D printers increases, there is a growing frequency of exposure to chemicals associated with 3D printing. However, research on the toxicity and harmfulness of chemicals generated by 3D printing is insufficient, and the performance of toxicity prediction using in silico techniques is limited due to missing molecular structure data. In this study, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model based on data-centric AI approach was developed to predict the toxicity of new 3D printing materials by imputing missing values in molecular descriptors.First, MissForest algorithm was utilized to impute missing values in molecular descriptors of hazardous 3D printing materials. Then, based on four different machine learning models (decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, SVM), a machine learning (ML)-based QSAR model was developed to predict the bioconcentration factor (Log BCF), octanol-air partition coefficient (Log Koa), and partition coefficient (Log P). Furthermore, the reliability of the data-centric QSAR model was validated through the Tree-SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method, which is one of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. The proposed imputation method based on the MissForest enlarged approximately 2.5 times more molecular structure data compared to the existing data. Based on the imputed dataset of molecular descriptor, the developed data-centric QSAR model achieved approximately 73%, 76% and 92% of prediction performance for Log BCF, Log Koa, and Log P, respectively. Lastly, Tree-SHAP analysis demonstrated that the data-centric-based QSAR model achieved high prediction performance for toxicity information by identifying key molecular descriptors highly correlated with toxicity indices. Therefore, the proposed QSAR model based on the data-centric XAI approach can be extended to predict the toxicity of potential pollutants in emerging printing chemicals, chemical process, semiconductor or display process."
"Formulating biomass allometric model for Paraserianthes falcataria (L) Nielsen (Sengon) in smallholder plantations, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia",2023,"['Above-ground biomass', 'allometry', 'biomass expansion factor', 'pantropical', 'Hutan Kemasyarakatan']",,"The forests in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia have been heavily impacted by logging, mining, fires, and other degradation activities for over 30 years. To address this, the Indonesian gov- ernment has promoted community-based forest management schemes. One such scheme, called Hutan Kemasyarakatan (HKm), has introduced Sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria) in smallholder plantations in Rungan Barat, Gunung Mas, Central Kalimantan. However, accur- ate estimation of biomass is crucial for carbon sequestration credits, but there are no specific allometric models for estimating Sengon above-ground biomass (AGB) in this area. To create a site-specific AGB allometric model for Sengon, 23 trees were felled to collect fresh biomass data. Various tree variables, such as diameter at breast height: 1.3 m (DBH), total height, mer- chantable height, and stem bole volume were measured for each sample tree. The average wood basic density of Sengon at the study site was also calculated. A total of nine alterna- tive candidate regression equations were fitted and tested to select the best-fit AGB allomet- ric model. Also, to assess the adaptedness of the identified AGB allometric model, comparisons with the models from literature, and comparisons between two interchange- able methodologies (i.e. direct biomass allometric model and biomass expansion factor (BEF)-based biomass estimation) were undertaken. This study has developed a regression function, denoted as Y ¼ 0:08062 �DBH2:36816 , to estimate the AGB of Sengon trees in smallholder plantations in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The formulated regression function demonstrated better estimation performance compared to common pantropical and regional AGB allometric models. In terms of the BEF-biomass approach, the AGB estimation derived from Smalian’s volume was relatively accurate, close to the mean AGB obtained by the formulated model in this study. In summary, this study proposes using the developed model, based solely on DBH, to accurately estimate AGB and carbon sequestration potential in Sengon trees. The accurate estimation of AGB using this model has additional advantages, including facilitating carbon credit acquisition and informing long-term management decisions."
Human Normalization Approach based on Disease Comparative Prediction Model between Covid-19 and Influenza,2023,"['COVID-19', 'Machine Learning', 'Traditional Korean Medicine']",,"There are serious problems worldwide, such as a pandemic due to an unprecedented infection caused by COVID-19. On previous approaches, they invented medical vaccines and preemptive testing tools for medical engineering. However, it is difficult to access poor medical systems and medical institutions due to disparities between countries and regions. In advanced nations, the damage was even greater due to high medical and examination costs because they did not go to the hospital. Therefore, from a software engineering-based perspective, we propose a learning model for determining coronavirus infection through symptom data-based software prediction models and tools. After a comparative analysis of various models (decision tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, multi-perceptron neural network), we decide to choose an appropriate decision tree model. Due to a lack of data, additional survey data and overseas symptom data are applied and built into the judgment model. To protect from thiswe also adapt human normalization approach with traditional Korean medicin approach. We expect to be possible to determine coronavirus, flu, allergy, and cold without medical examination and diagnosis tools through data collection and analysis by applying decision trees."

To facilitate decisions or relationships between nodes, nodes in an XML tree are typically labeled in a way that can quickly establish an ancestor-descendant on relationship between two nodes. However, these techniques have the disadvantage of re-labeling existing nodes or recalculating certain values if insertion occurs due to sequential updates. Therefore, in current labeling techniques, the cost of updating labels is very high. In this paper, we propose a new labeling technique called Fast XML encoding, which supports the update of order-sensitive XML documents without re-labeling or recalculation. It also controls the length of the label by reusing deleted labels at the same location in the XML tree. The proposed reuse algorithm can reduce the length of the label when all deleted labels are inserted in the same location. The proposed technique in the experimental results can efficiently handle order-sensitive queries and updates."
Towards modeling growth of apricot fruit: finding a proper growth model,2023,['Growth pattern   \xa0·  Neural network   \xa0·  Nonlinear regression   \xa0·  RBF'],,"Fruit growth patterns are often exploited in predictions of ﬁ nal fruit size and to inform planting and harvesting decisions.Ten local apricot ( Prunus armeniaca ) varieties with superior genotypes (two early-ripening, ﬁ ve mid-ripening and three late-ripening varieties) were assessed using 20 nonlinear regression models (NRMs) and a radial basis function (RBF) neural network model. Fruit diameter and weight measurements for each genotype were collected at four-day intervals from fruit set to commercial harvest. Patterns based on diameter and weights were attributed to each genotype. Among the NRM tested, only four were able to ﬂ awlessly predict apricot diameter and weight during the growing season. In addition, comparison of nonlinear regression methods with the neural network indicated than the RBF model displayed fewer prediction errors than the NRMs. The RBF model predicted fruit size with a coeﬃ  cient of determination  (R 2 value) greater than 0.95. Therefore, predictions of growth patterns in fruit trees can be accomplished with neural network modeling."

This paper employed machine learning (ML) using the U.S. nationwide stated choice experiment to understand how travelers adopt new transportation modes or continue to use conventional modes of transportation. Specifically, this study used interpretable ML to investigate the optimal algorithm (i.e., stochastic gradient boosting decision tree model) in greater depth, including feature importance and non-linear marginal effects. Several notable findings in this study add further understanding. First, the findings of permutation-based feature importance suggest that transportation mode choice behavior in the era of AVs would be significantly influenced by the level of services of each transportation mode and individual attitudes toward driving, AVs, technology, and alternative transportation modes. Moreover, direct marginal effect estimations regarding the crucial factors reveal that the non-linear relationships indicate that the effects were generally noticeable within certain ranges across different transportation modes; specifically, many showed a threshold effect at a certain unit change. The paper contributes to (1) exploring how people would react to a variety of transportation modes likely to coexist, including private AVs, shared mobility services, and conventional transportation modes, (2) supporting the decision-making process through crucial underlying knowledge not currently available, and (3) elaborating the limitations of ML for transportation mode choice modeling and suggests potential future avenues for methodological improvement."

"Relationship between female sexual function, vaginal volume, vaginal resting tone, and pelvic floor muscle strength in women with stress urinary incontinence",2023,"['Dyspareunia', 'Intravaginal', 'Sexual dysfunction', 'Physiological', 'Pelvic floor']",,"Objective Vaginal morphology and pelvic floor muscle (PFM) strength may influence sexual stimulation, sensation, and orgasmic response. This study aimed to determine the relationship between female sexual function and PFM strength and vaginal morphology (represented by vaginal resting tone and vaginal volume) in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI).Methods Forty-two subjects with SUI were recruited for the study. Female sexual function was measured using the female sexual function index (FSFI) questionnaire. PFM strength was measured by digital palpation. Vaginal resting tone (mmHg) and vaginal volume (mL) were measured using a perineometer. The significance of the correlations between female sexual function and PFM function and hip muscle strength was assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. If a significant correlation between vaginal morphology and FSFI score was confirmed using Pearson’s correlation, the cutoff value was confirmed through a decision tree.Results PFM strength was significantly correlated with desire (r=0.397), arousal (r=0.388), satisfaction (r=0.326), and total (r=0.315) FSFI scores. Vaginal resting tone (r=-0.432) and vaginal volume (r=0.332) were significantly correlated with the FSFI pain score. The cutoff point of vaginal resting tone for the presence of pain-related sexual dysfunction was >15.2 mmHg.Conclusion PFM strength training should be the first strategy to improve female sexual function. Additionally, because of the relationship between vaginal morphology and pain-related sexual dysfunction, surgical procedures to achieve vaginal rejuvenation should be carefully considered."

Methods To achieve the purpose of this study, a pitcher from the LG Twins team of the Korean professional baseball league was selected, and 13,000 pitches from the 2019~2023 season were collected. The collected data is not secondary data aggregated by year or game, but raw data corresponding to each pitch. The algorithm for developing is the XGBoost, which is an ensemble learning algorithm based on decision trees. A total of four AI models were developed by adjusting the input variables. The prediction results were set to output the predicted probability value for the pitch type. Result The accuracy of the first AI model with the pitch situation information and the pitch information as input variables was 93.04%. The accuracy of the second AI model with only the pitch situation information as input variables was 55.04%. The accuracy of the AI model modeled with the pitch situation information and the information of the pitch thrown immediately before the pitch as input variables was 61.30%. The accuracy of the fourth AI model with the pitch situation information and the information of the pitch thrown immediately before the pitch and the pitch thrown before that was 70.45%. Conclusion The four AI models in this study are divided into two major categories, depending on whether the pitch information is input. In fact, the model developed based on the values of the pitch speed and strike zone of the actual pitch had very good prediction performance.

Hence, the purpose of this study was to establish a system for calculating the safety factor and determining the recommended use-by-date for each food type, thereby providing a scientific basis for the recommended use-by-date labels. A safety factor calculation technique based on scientific principles was designed through literature review and simulation, and opinions were collected by conducting surveys and discussions including industry and academia, among others. The main considerations in this study were pH, Aw, sterilization, preservatives, packaging for storage improvement, storage temperature, and other external factors. A safety factor of 0.97 was exceptionally applied for frozen products and 1.0 for sterilized products. In addition, a between-sample error value of 0.08 was applied to factors related to product and experimental design. This study suggests that clearly providing a safe use-by-date will help reduce food waste and contribute to carbon neutrality."

The used car online platform service discloses vehicle specifications, accident history, inspection history, and detailed options to service consumers. Most of the preceding studies were predictions of used car prices using vehicle specifications and some options for vehicles. As a result of the study, it was confirmed that there was a nonlinear relationship between used car prices and some specification variables. Accordingly, the researchers tried to solve the nonlinear problem by executing a Machine Learning model. In common, the Regression based Machine Learning model had the advantage of knowing the actual influence and direction of variables, but there was a disadvantage of low Cost Function figures compared to the Decision Tree based Machine Learning model. This study attempted to predict used car prices of six domestic brands by utilizing both vehicle specifications and vehicle options. Through this, we tried to collect the advantages of the two types of Machine Learning models. To this end, we sequentially conducted a regression based Machine Learning model and a decision tree based Machine Learning model.

As the volatility of the initial price of the listing date increases, the incentive to develop prediction models that provides predictive information on the initial price of public offering stocks will increase. Against this background, this study aims to explore the influencing factors on the prediction of the new listing date of public offering stocks by using various machine learning algorithms based on data from issuers' prospectuses and securities filings. For companies listed on the KOSDAQ market for the last three years, a model for predicting the initial public offering stock price was built using logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. As a result of the study, the top variables that affect the initial price of public offering stocks were ‘amount available for circulation’, ‘general offer competition rate’, and ‘confirmation ratio for mandatory holding(lock-up)’, and it was confirmed that these variables are the main influencing factors on the initial price of public offering stocks. The smaller the circulating supply (average 20% or less), the higher the 100% probability of starting. In addition, general subscriptions incur opportunity costs due to the time required for margin payment and return. Despite these opportunity costs, a high subscription competition ratio has a positive effect on the excess return. Finally, the ‘obligatory holding commitment ratio’ is a commitment ratio in which institutional investors do not sell public offering stocks for a certain period of time during the demand forecasting process, and the higher the ratio (on average, more than 20%), the higher the probability of a 100% initial public offering price."

The used car online platform discloses vehicle specifications, accident history, inspection history, and detailed options to consumers.Most of the studies for predicting used car prices were studies using vehicle specifications. In addition, the relationship between the mileage and period of use of the vehicle and the used car price tended to appear nonlinear. In order to solve this problem, recent studies have attempted to reduce Cost Function using Machine Learning models. Accordingly, this study sequentially executed Regression based and Decision Tree based Machine Learning models using vehicle specifications and vehicle options.The implications of this study were, first, to make the most of their advantages by continuously executing two types of Machine Learning models. Second, which of the vehicle's specifications and option variables affects the price prediction of used cars, and the influence and direction of these variables were confirmed.

There is a delay between the calibration date and when the dose of I-131 is administered to a patient. Therefore, it is necessary to directly measure the radioactivity of the administered dose using a dose calibrator. In this study, we attempted to apply machine learning modeling to measured external dose rates from shielded I-131 in order to predict their radioactivity. External dose rates were measured at 1 m, 0.3 m, and 0.1 m distances from a shielded container with the I-131, with a total of 868 sets of measurements taken. For the modeling process, we utilized the hold-out method to partition the data with a 7:3 ratio (609 for the training set:259 for the test set). For the machine learning algorithms, we chose linear regression, decision tree, random forest and XGBoost. To evaluate the models, we calculated root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate accuracy and R2 to evaluate explanatory power. Evaluation results are as follows. Linear regression (RMSE 268.15, MSE 71901.87, MAE 231.68, R2 0.92), decision tree (RMSE 108.89, MSE 11856.92, MAE 19.24, R2 0.99), random forest (RMSE 8.89, MSE 79.10, MAE 6.55, R2 0.99), XGBoost (RMSE 10.21, MSE 104.22, MAE 7.68, R2 0.99). The random forest model achieved the highest predictive ability. Improving the model’s performance in the future is expected to contribute to lowering exposure among radiology technologists."

It seeks to identify the factors that influence the method of resolving public conflicts and determine which predictive factors are significant. To achieve this, machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines were employed to examine the factors affecting public conflict resolution. These methods consistently highlight the duration and type of public conflicts as critical variables in determining conflict resolution. By analyzing the specific importance of these variables, it becomes possible to predict the resolution method based on the duration of the conflict and whether the major participants are government or civilians. When combined with the number of participants, issues and nature of public conflicts, predictions become more reliable. However, model evaluations revealed the need for more detailed and precise data collection for future public conflict studies. Nevertheless, the models exhibited lower precision, recall, and accuracy than expected, suggesting that significant improvements are needed in various aspects. These improvements should focus more on expanding independent variables and providing a precise distinction for the dependent variable, rather than relying solely on machine learning techniques."

Consequently, accurately determining the radio communication coverage range is crucial. To address this issue, a Radio Environment Map (REM) can be used to provide information about the radio environment in a specific area. In this paper, a technique for estimating an indoor REM using a mobile robot and machine learning methods is introduced. The mobile robot first collects and processes data, including the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and location estimation. This data is then used to implement the REM through machine learning regression algorithms such as Extra Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor. Furthermore, the numerical and visual performance of REM for each model can be assessed in terms of R2 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)."

Therefore, a preparatory process of verifying awareness and acceptance of FCEV and hydrogen energy through research is necessary. As there are issues about the safety of hydrogen energy due to several explosion accidents, we hypothesized that psychological attitudes to hydrogen energy like risk perception and familiarity would be effect on vehicle purchase behavior. In order to verify hypothesis this study analyzed using logistic regression and decision tree method, a machine learning technique for a preference model among FCEVs. The results show that hydrogen risk has a larger influence than hydrogen familiarity on the choice of FCEVs. In addition, we identified that the variables which are vehicle price, charge price, VKT(Vehicle Kilometers Traveled), distance to the charging station, gender, and age group also affect on vehicle purchase behavior. Using the decision tree algorithm in the AI technique, analysis results for vehicle preference in e-mobility (EVs, hybrid, FCEVs) show that hybrid vehicles select 46%, EVs 31%, FCEVs 23%. In addition, as a result of analyzing the influence of variables on the e-mobility Preference, the major variables were charge price, distance to the charging station, and vehicle price, in the descending order of importance."

However, the national forest expansion policy has not deemed the following purchase price of private forests: (1) the standing trees omitted for the purchase in principle, and (2) the public value of forests. In this study, we evaluated forest land, standing trees, and public values of private forest lands purchased by the government in 2015-2016 to assess the values of forests. The results showed that the subjective decision of certified public appraisers greatly influenced the appraisal and assessment of forest land (e.g., the selection of the case regions for the transaction according to the selection of comparative plots and the omission of the value of standing trees in determining individual and other factors. Additionally, the official price posted by the Korea Forestry Promotion Institute with no harvesting cost and forest-related corporation profits was the standard for evaluating the value of standing trees of private forests when purchased. Lastly, the public values of forests should be actively reflected when purchasing private forests."

This result suggests that Young Adults tend to leave their organizations and change their jobs shortly right after adapting to their workplaces. These patterns provide a number of  significant policy implications for organizations, as the recruitment and training of new employees incur substantial costs in terms of resources and time. Additionally, the younger generation faces considerable economic burdens when leaving their current jobs and re-entering the job market to pursue new opportunities, making this a matter of significant social concerns and problems. With this serious awareness, the current study aims to identify the main factors that could influence young individuals' decisions to change their jobs, as well as to categorize the antecedent variables into individual characteristics, human capital variables, workplace, and job-related variables. Based on these factors, the study aims to predict the voluntary turnover among Young Adults. To conduct empirical analyses, the study intends to utilize both binary logistic regression and the CHAID algorithm-based decision tree model. Recognizing that different social and economic factors may give an impact  on job-changing decisions for each gender-based cohort, the study divided the data by gender for a separate analysis.The binary logistic regression analysis confirmed that, for the male group, the probability of job change is more likely to increase if they were unmarried, more likely to perceive their economic status as poor, more prone to work under non-regular employment status, more likely to have job responsibilities that are below their educational level, being not aligned with their academic major. Conversely, for the female group, the likelihood of job change is shown to increase if they are unmarried, to perceive their economic status as poor, to lack job-training experience, to have job-related education through private education facility, to have academic experience studying abroad, and to be employed with non-regular positions.

However, small patient data and specific deep learning algorithms were selected and utilized, and research was conducted to show meaningful results under specific conditions. In this study, in order to generalize the research results, patients were further expanded and subdivided to derive the results of a study predicting mortality after lung cancer diagnosis for men and women in their 80s, 90s, and 100s. Using AutoML, which provides large-scale medical information and various deep learning algorithms from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, five algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Logistic Registration were created to predict mortality rates for 84 months after lung cancer diagnosis. As a result of the study, men in their 80s and 90s had a higher mortality prediction rate than women, and women in their 100s had a higher mortality prediction rate than men. And the factor that has the greatest influence on the mortality rate was analyzed as the treatment period."

Continuous authentication on mobile devices has been studied by recognizing and authenticating user behavior using various sensors. In contrast, continuous authentication on PC-based devices with limited sensors has been studied by extracting and analyzing features from keyboard and mouse input patterns. In this paper, features are extracted based on finger-specific input patterns of users typing on a qwerty keyboard on a PC. The keyboard is typically allocated to the fingers of both hands when pressing each key. Therefore, key hold (key1 Down - key1 Up) latency, key press (key1 Down - key2 Down latency) latency caused by interaction between fingers, and key interval (key1 UP - key2 Down latency) latency are extracted as characteristics to improve the accuracy of continuous authentication. The continuous authentication model uses SVDD, Decision Tree, and CNN, and raw data is collected by conducting experiments where users input random sentences. The verification of the continuous authentication model was conducted by comparing the classification accuracy (ACC), EER which is the threshold of ROC curve and FRR, FAR, and the result showed that using finger-specific input characteristics of the user yielded higher accuracy than the existing research that utilized only general key input characteristics."

The relationship between income level and fear of crime, which was not properly investigated in domestic studies, was examined based on the vulnerability model. The different findings from the Western studies were explained by examining the relationship between the two and collective efficacy. We utilized the “Korea National Crime Victimization Survey of 2020” which was collected by the Korean Institute of Criminology and Justice.The results of the curve estimation test showed that the F-value increased when the relationship between income and general fear of crime was non-linear, compared to when it was linear. Additionally, the curve estimation test indicated that the relationship between income and specific fear of crime was significant both when it was linear and when it was non-linear. The linear results were significant, but they differed from those observed in Western societies. Additional tests of decision tree analysis revealed that crime fear tends to be highest when income levels are relatively high and collective efficiency is high. Conversely, crime fear tends to be lowest “when income levels are relatively low but collective efficiency is high.”.The implications for future research were discussed based on the findings of the non-linear relationship between income and fear of crime in the context of South Korea’s culture and type of residence."
How Well can Machine Learning Models Classify Individuals with and without Non-Specific Chronic Neck Pain based on Cervical Movements during Protraction and Retraction?,2023,"['Cervical protraction', 'Cervical retraction', 'Machine learning', 'Non-specific chronic neck pain']",,"Background The human cervical spine, vital for supporting head movements, is susceptible to degenerative changes, especially non-specific chronic neck pain (NSCNP). Cervical protraction and retraction, which are key components of cervical spine motion, have been studied to assess their role in NSCNP. However, the existing research lacks quantitative assessments and explores nonlinear relationships.Purpose This study explored the relationship between cervical movements during protraction and retraction and NSCNP using machine learning (ML) techniques for classification.Study design Cross sectional study.Methods This study included 277 non-NSCNP and 463 NSCNP office workers. Data were collected from the musculoskeletal screening tests. Two-dimensional video analysis was used to track markers during cervical protraction and retraction. The head tilt angle (HTA), craniovertebral angle (CVA), head excursion angle (HEA), and protraction/retraction distances were measured. Six ML algorithms (random forest, neural network, decision tree, gradient boosting, logistic regression, and support vector machine) were employed to classify individuals with and without the NSCNP. The model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.Results Random forest performed best, with a test AUC of 0.800, followed by decision trees (0.790), and gradient boosting (0.701). Logistic regression and support vector machine had the lowest performance. CVA during retraction, CVA and HEA during protraction were significant predictors of NSCNP in the random forest model, indicating the importance of cervical retraction and protraction kinematics.Conclusions ML models can enhance our understanding of NSCNP and the role of cervical movements. These findings offer potential targets for assessment and intervention in NSCNP cases, and suggest the clinical utility of random forests for classification. Further research is needed to explore these relationships in diverse populations and investigate the underlying mechanisms."

The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) currently uses the same criteria for all regions in Korea for watch and warning based on the maximum cumulative rainfall with durations of 3-hour and 12-hour to reduce damage. However, KMA's criteria do not consider the regional characteristics of damages caused by heavy rainfall and typhoon events. In this regard, it is necessary to develop new criteria considering regional characteristics of damage and cumulative rainfalls in durations, establishing four stages: blue, yellow, orange, and red. A classification model, called DSCM (Disaster Severity Classification Model), for the four-stage disaster severity was developed using four machine learning models (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost). This study applied DSCM to local governments of Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi Province province. To develop DSCM, we used data on rainfall, cumulative rainfall, maximum rainfalls for durations of 3-hour and 12-hour, and antecedent rainfall as independent variables, and a 4-class damage scale for heavy rain damage and typhoon damage for each local government as dependent variables. As a result, the Decision Tree model had the highest accuracy with an F1-Score of 0.56. We believe that this developed DSCM can help identify disaster risk at each stage and contribute to reducing damage through efficient disaster management for local governments based on specific events."

And based on the results, we tried to find educational implications that can help learn state classification of matter.Methods  For 31 elementary and middle school science teachers enrolled in the Graduate School of Education at the College of Education located in the central region, matter classification activities were performed and a decision tree algorithm was applied to the machine learning model. And the effectiveness of the program was confirmed through model performance evaluation such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall.Results  The classification accuracy of developed machine learning model for classifying state of matter was 0.820, the F1-score was 0.820, the precision was 0.826 and the recall was 0.820. In addition, the degree of discrepancy between the classification results of science teachers and the classification results of the decision tree algorithm was larger in heterogeneous mixtures than in pure matters or homogeneous mixtures. This discrepancy was analyzed as a phenomenon that occurs because science teachers do not consistently apply the classification criteria from the macroscopic and microscopic perspectives or do have the concept that a specific matter is a specific state in advance when classifying the state of matter. Based on the results of these studies, the cause of confusion revealed in the process of classifying the state of matter pointed out in previous studies was found.Conclusions  Based on the research results, it was possible to find the cause of confusion revealed in the process of classifying the state of matter of students pointed out in previous studies, and since machine learning can be an effective tool for diagnosing learning conditions, it is suggested that teacher training is needed to utilize it."

Thus, in this paper, we consider various risk factors that contribute to the occurrence of stoke and machine learning algorithms, for example, the decision tree, random forest, and naive Bayes algorithms, on patient characteristics survey data to achieve high prediction accuracy. We also consider the semisupervised self-training technique to predict the risk of stroke. We then consider the near-miss undersampling technique, which can select only instances in larger classes with the smaller class instances. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains an accuracy of approximately 98.83% at low cost, which is significantly higher and more reliable compared with the compared techniques."

Salivary and clinical characteristics were collected and analyzed.Result: Patients with xerostomia had significantly lower levels of UFR (0.29±0.22 vs. 0.41±0.24 ml/min) and SFR (1.12±0.55 vs. 1.39±0.94 ml/min) (P<0.001), respectively, compared to those with non-xerostomia. The presence of xerostomia had a significantly negative correlation with UFR (r=–0.603, P=0.002) and SFR (r=–0.301, P=0.017). In the diagnosis of xerostomia based on the CART algorithm, the presence of stomatitis, candidiasis, halitosis, psychiatric disorder, and hyperlipidemia were significant predictors for xerostomia, and the cutoff ranges for xerostomia for UFR and SFR were 0.03~0.18 ml/min and 0.85~1.6 ml/min, respectively.Conclusion: Xerostomia was correlated with decreases in UFR and SFR, and their cutoff values varied depending on the patient’s underlying oral and systemic conditions."

The frequency of use was in the order of tree size > environment > planting density > forest age. Analysis of factors impacting height and diameter growth revealed that the growth rate of species other than Quercus variabilis was negative in the field survey. This may be because of differences between the actual trees planted and specifications in the construction drawings, which may be attributed to the site conditions and decisions made by the project subject during construction. Furthermore, simple linear regression analysis was conducted with time, height at planting, density, and species code as the independent variables and growth rate as the dependent variable. A strong positive linear correlation was noted between height and diameter.This work builds a foundation for developing a forest restoration model and simulation program based on a regression model derived from the four variables tested."

Based on statistics in 2021, Korea's national cremation rate exceeded 92%, and compared to less than 20% of the cremation rate just 20 years ago, our business method has changed rapidly. As the cremation promotion movement and government policies, which began in the early 90s, were systematically developed, the enshrinement facility was established next to us. However, while this was also subject to criticism of national damage, the Jang Act called natural field was introduced into the system in 2008, and about 15 years have passed, but the revitalization of natural field is slower than expected. One of the reasons for the stagnation of development is to forget the basic spirit of the natural field (once you return to the forest), and to think like a graveyard grave. Accordingly, this study aims to identify the background of the introduction and current operation of natural fields and present development measures to improve memorial services to make natural fields loved by the people."
실내 환경에서의 주행가능성을 고려한 라이다 기반 이동 로봇 탐사 기법,2023,"['Mobile Robot Exploration', 'Path-Planning', 'Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree', 'Grid Map SkeleTonization', 'Indoor Environment With Glass Obstacles']",,"This paper presents a method for autonomous exploration of indoor environments using a 2-dimensional Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) scanner. The proposed frontier-based exploration method considers navigability from the current robot position to extracted frontier targets. An approach to constructing the point cloud grid map that accurately reflects the occupancy probability of glass obstacles is proposed, enabling identification of safe frontier grids on the safety grid map calculated from the point cloud grid map. Navigability, indicating whether the robot can successfully navigate to each frontier target, is calculated by applying the skeletonization-informed rapidly exploring random tree algorithm to the safety grid map. While conventional exploration approaches have focused on frontier detection and target position/direction decision, the proposed method discusses a safe navigation approach for the overall exploration process until the completion of mapping. Real-world experiments have been conducted to verify that the proposed method leads the robot to avoid glass obstacles and safely navigate the entire environment, constructing the point cloud map and calculating the navigability with low computing time deviation."

However, designing feature engineering is generally iterative, complex and time-consuming step. Also, the large scale of time series data is rapidly generated from the industry, but there is a shortage of data scientists to handle them. So, it has become necessary to automate this process. In this paper, we aim to develop a meta model-based feature selection method that can learn about which features work best given the dataset. The proposed meta-model is a kind of warm-start that can search from the candidate features that is expected to be good without starting a new search for each data. Proposed method is compared by real time-series datasets obtained from UEA & UCR Time Series Classification Repository. Then, we show the proposed method outperforms random search in terms of F1-measure."

This study was intended to provide basic data for the development of customized forest healing programs by comprehensively analyzing the degree of awareness of forest healing resources by gender and age group, actual measurements, and forest healing effects recognized by visitors in domestic luxury forests for general adults in Korea. To measure the degree of awareness of forest healing resources and the degree of awareness of forest healing effects, a self-developed questionnaire was used, and 531 copies of data were collected for luxury forest visitors. The reliability of the questionnaire was analyzed to be reliable with Cronbach's Alpha value of 0.928 (forest healing resources) and 0.908 (healing effects). Actual measurements of forest healing resources were measured on phytoncide, anions, weather environment (temperature, wind, etc.), sunlight (lightness), and fine dust. The intention and satisfaction of revisiting were higher as the degree of recognition of physical, psychological, and social healing effects was higher. The degree of recognition of physical, psychological, and social healing effects was analyzed to be higher as the level of normal health was high, and the number of forest healing resources felt in the forest increased. Therefore, when constructing a forest healing program, it is necessary to have a configuration that can feel various healing resources. In addition, by gender and age group, men and those in their 40s need to be configured to increase the psychological healing effect, and for women and those in their 60s, it is necessary to configure a program that can increase the social healing effect with visitors. In addition, in the case of those in their 50s, it is expected that it is necessary to construct a program applying the amount of exercise that can feel the physical healing effect. Through this study, forest healing programs by gender and age group were proposed, and if data were accumulated and analyzed, it is expected that the forest healing effect could be enhanced through programs tailored to each gender and age group."

The aim of this study was to design a decision system based on machine learning algorithms by using clinical measurements and radiographic images in order to determine and facilitate the staging and grading of periodontitis.Methods: In the first part of this study, machine learning models were created using the Python programming language based on clinical data from 144 individuals who presented to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Süleyman Demirel University. In the second part, panoramic radiographic images were processed and classification was carried out with deep learning algorithms.Results: Using clinical data, the accuracy of staging with the tree algorithm reached 97.2%, while the random forest and k-nearest neighbor algorithms reached 98.6% accuracy. The best staging accuracy for processing panoramic radiographic images was provided by a hybrid network model algorithm combining the proposed ResNet50 architecture and the support vector machine algorithm. For this, the images were preprocessed, and high success was obtained, with a classification accuracy of 88.2% for staging. However, in general, it was observed that the radiographic images provided a low level of success, in terms of accuracy, for modeling the grading of periodontitis.Conclusions: The machine learning-based decision system presented herein can facilitate periodontal diagnoses despite its current limitations.

A total of 14 financial ratios related to growth, profitability, stability, and activity indicators of 22 hotels were used for the empirical analysis of the study. In addition, after verifying the significance of the variables to set a model that can be classified as marginal and normal companies, nine financial ratio variables were finally selected in 2018, seven in 2019, and eight in 2020. The results of the empirical analysis are as follows. First, since this study focuses on the predictive model of marginal hotels, the predictive rates are important. It can be seen that the predictive rate of marginal companies using the confusion matrix is relatively low compared to normal hotels, and is increasing over time. This means that the financial health of hotels has deteriorated due to COVID-19. Second, after checking the performance evaluation indicators of each model by year, the logistic regression model was found to be the highest of all performance evaluation indicators, and was presented in the order of support vector machine and neural network. In particular, when it comes to AUC and accuracy, all three of the above models were shown to exceed 90%. Since the results of such an analysis can effectively grasp the characteristics of marginal companies, they can be used as a basis for rational judgment to prevent the financial distress of hotels in advance."

In the fall of 1981, ‘forest death’, which was triggered by the serialized articles in the Spiegel, refers to the phenomenon in which trees in forests in Central Europe die due to acid rain. ‘Forest death’ controversy produced the achievement of the Green Party entering the parliament in 1983 in West German politics, and served as a decisive opportunity for the Helmut Kohl government to introduce eco-friendly policies. It also brought about a change in the direction of the environmental movement in West Germany in the 1980s, and awakened citizens’ environmental consciousness on a everyday life. The debate over the ‘forest death’ united Germans beyond political faction, generation, and gender, and can be regarded as an important driving force that facilitated the transition to the ‘age of ecology’."
Probabilistic Risk-Based Planning of Distributed Generation Units Using Multi Objective Hybrid Augmented Weighted ε-Constraint Approach,2023,"['Distributed generation planning', 'Multi-objective optimization', 'Risk analysis', 'Uncertainty']",,"Utilization of Distributed Generation (DG) resources has increased dramatically in power systems due to economic and environmental benefits. Risk-based planning methods could manage the operational and economic risks at acceptable levels. In this paper a new probabilistic multi-objective risk-based DG planning method is proposed. In the proposed method, operation and investment costs minimization, reliability improvement, losses minimization, and operational risks minimization are considered. Uncertainties of wind generation and demand are modeled by using scenario tree and two stage method. The multi-objective problem is solved by using a combination of lexicographic optimization technique and hybrid augmented weighted ε-constraint approach. In addition, fuzzy satisfying criterion is used for decision making among Pareto solutions. Analyzing the numerical results validated that the proposed method has an appropriate and accurate performance in achieving the set of Pareto solutions. By analyzing the Pareto solutions, it is proved that by more investment on DG allocation, reduction of loss and operation risk could be appropriately achieved. Comprehensive risk analysis of wind energy generation and the curtailment of wind power are conducted under different cases. It is concluded that when the wind power injection increases the negative effects on the power system increase. Moreover, in case of considering wind power curtailment, the risk factor significantly reduced."

The Effect of Inaccurate Quality Signaling under Information Asymmetry,2023,"['Information Asymmetry', 'Information Disclosure', 'Lemon Market', 'Quality Certification']",,"Purpose - This study attempts to provide a new theoretical perspective on the quality signaling and its impact on a market under information asymmetry, focusing on how the accuracy and the cost of quality signaling affect sellers’ and buyers’ profit, suggesting appropriate designs of quality signaling methods which mitigates information asymmetry.Design/methodology/approach - In order to examine the effect of quality signaling on strategic interactions within the market, we establish an analytic model where market outcomes are determined by seller’s quality claim and price, and buyers are risk-neutral. By investigating this analytic model through relevant game trees, we find the subgame perfect Nash equilibria of the market and predict related market outcomes based on sellers’ quality signaling strategy.Findings - Our analytic model shows counterintuitive results that seller profit will be the lowest with inaccurate quality signaling and the highest with no quality signaling, mostly due to the certification cost. Consequently, sellers should proceed with caution if the quality signaling is less than accurate, as it may backfire. We believe that this is due to the fact that the inaccuracy of quality signaling causes some confusion and uncertainty in both sellers and buyers’ decision to maximize profit, making it hard for sellers to predict buyers’ behavior.Research implications or Originality - Although the sources and types of quality signaling errors have been investigated in the literature, there has not been satisfactory understanding regarding how inaccuracy of quality certification affects specific market outcomes. We expect that our theoretical model would provide important implications on how to utilize quality signaling to solve adverse selection issues in markets under information asymmetry."

Improvement of Dialysis Dosing Using Big Data Analytics,2023,"['Data Science', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Statistical Data Analysis', 'Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Machine Learning']",,"Objectives: Large amounts of healthcare data are now generated via patient health records, records of diagnosis and treatment,smart devices, and wearables. Extracting insights from such data can transform healthcare from a traditional, symptom-driven practice into precisely personalized medicine. Dialysis treatments generate a vast amount of data, with more than100 parameters that must be regulated for ideal treatment outcomes. When complications occur, understanding electrolyteparameters and predicting their outcomes to deliver the optimal dialysis dosing for each patient is a challenge. This studyfocused on refining dialysis dosing by utilizing emerging data from the growing number of dialysis patients to improve patients’quality of life and well-being. Methods: Exploratory data analysis and data prediction approaches were performed togather insights from patients’ vital electrolytes on how to improve the patients’ dialysis dosing. Four predictive models wereconstructed to predict electrolyte levels through various dialysis parameters. Results: The decision tree model showed excellentperformance and more accurate results than the support vector machine, linear regression, and neural network models.Conclusions: The predictive models identified that pre-dialysis blood urea nitrogen, pre-weight, dry weight, anticoagulation,and sex had the most significant effects on electrolyte concentrations. Such models could fine-tune dialysis dosing levels forthe growing number of dialysis patients to improve each patient’s quality of life, life expectancy, and well-being, and to reducecosts, efforts, and time consumption for both patients and physicians. The study’s results need to be validated on a largerscale."
Machine Learning vs. Logistic Regression for Classifying Pressure Pain Hypersensitivity Based on Postural Analysis Data in Food Service Workers with Nonspecific Neck/Shoulder Myofascial Pain,2023,"['Food service workers', 'Machine learning', 'Myofascial pain', 'Pressure pain hypersensitivity']",,"Background Pressure pain hypersensitivity (PPH) is used to measure pain sensitivity in deep tissues, but factors contributing to PPH remain unclear. Abnormal neck and scapula posture are thought to play a role in shoulder pain. Traditional statistical methods like logistic regression have limitations in capturing complex relationships, while machine learning (ML) can model nonlinear relationships effectively.Purpose The purpose of the present study was to develop, evaluate, and compare the predictive performance of ML models and logistic regression for classifying food service workers (FWs) with and without PPH based on postural analysis data.Study design Cross sectional study.Methods FWs (n=150) meeting specific criteria were assessed for PPH and underwent postural analysis. ML algorithms (logistic regression, neural network, random forest, gradient boosting, decision tree, and support vector machine) were used for classification. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Feature importance was assessed.Results Gradient boosting exhibited the best performance (AUC: 0.867) in classifying PPH, followed by random forest (AUC: 0.822) in the test dataset. Logistic regression performed less effectively (AUC: 0.613). For feature importance analysis, scapular downward rotation ratio, forward head posture, BMI and rounded shoulder angle were the top four important predictors of PPH in gradient boosting model.Conclusions Gradient boosting, along with identified predictors, offers promise for early intervention and risk assessment tools in addressing musculoskeletal pain in food service workers."

To this end, first, the extent to which sustainable landscape design principles are applied to existing urban parks was studied, and elements of the landscape design concept were derived based on the literature. In addition, the 10 guidelines of the Sustainable Sites Initiative (SITES) were summarized, and five of the 10 elements were derived through previous studies, and then the Seoul Forest Park, the subject of the study, was analyzed. Based on this, we conducted a study on how sustainable design principles are applied in Seoul Forest Park.  As a result of the study, we found that Seoul Forest Park is operated appropriately with sustainable landscape design principles. However, due to practical issues such as artificial tree transplantation and soil conditions, it was felt necessary to set a direction that fully considers the possibility of problems arising from these conditions in the future. Seoul Forest Park has a design principle that emphasizes the balance of the natural environment and ecosystem and takes into account the cultural characteristics of the area, transforming the surrounding area into a vibrant space and promoting sustainable development.

머신러닝을 통한 잉크 필요량 예측 알고리즘,2023,"['Machine Learning', 'XGBoost', 'Ink Usage', 'Regression']",,"Research and interest in sustainable printing are increasing in the packaging printing industry. Currently, predicting the amount of ink required for each work is based on the experience and intuition of field workers. Suppose the amount of ink produced is more than necessary. In this case, the rest of the ink cannot be reused and is discarded, adversely affecting the company's productivity and environment. Nowadays, machine learning models can be used to figure out this problem. This study compares the ink usage prediction machine learning models. A simple linear regression model, Multiple Regression Analysis, cannot reflect the nonlinear relationship between the variables required for packaging printing, so there is a limit to accurately predicting the amount of ink needed. This study has established various prediction models which are based on CART (Classification and Regression Tree), such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, and XGBoost. The accuracy of the models is determined by the K-fold cross-validation. Error metrics such as root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared are employed to evaluate estimation models' correctness. Among these models, XGBoost model has the highest prediction accuracy and can reduce 2134 (g) of wasted ink for each work. Thus, this study motivates machine learning's potential to help advance productivity and protect the environment."

Evaluation and classification of stator turn‑to‑turn faults using electrical equivalent circuits for surface permanent magnet brushless direct current motors,2023,"['Turn-to-turn fault', 'Current signature analysis', 'Neural network', 'Surface permanent magnet motor']",,"Stator turn-to-turn faults occur due to improper loading, eccentricity in the rotor, and increases in the operating temperature. During the occurrence of a stator turn-to-turn fault, an abnormal temperature increase occurs, and if this state is left unattended for a long duration, it can lead to degradation of the permanent magnet. This paper presents an analytical modeling scheme for surface permanent magnet brushless DC motors for diagnosing and classifying stator turn-to-turn faults using SIMULINK® during non-stationary operating conditions. A significant increase in the stator current, back EMF, torque, and speed is observed. A current signature analysis is performed during non-stationary operating conditions using a fast Fourier transform method to identify the severity of the fault. Furthermore, a simple and efficient classification model is developed by selecting the best classifier among the decision trees, neural network, support vector machine, discriminant analysis, and ensemble classifier. A statistical evaluation of the current signal for fault feature extraction and ranking is performed based on minimum redundancy and maximum relevance, Chi-square test, Relief F, analysis of variance, and Kruskal–Wallis test. The dataset for classification is extracted from a Simulink analytical model. Neural network-based classifiers can classify faults precisely and rapidly with a minimum number of features."

Ensemble Deep Learning Model using Random Forest for Patient Shock Detection,2023,"['Digital healthcare', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Random forest', 'MAP', 'Shock patient']",,"Digital healthcare combined with telemedicine services in the form of convergence with digital technology and AI is developing rapidly. Digital healthcare research is being conducted on many conditions including shock. However, the causes of shock are diverse, and the treatment is very complicated, requiring a high level of medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose a shock detection method based on the correlation between shock and data extracted from hemodynamic monitoring equipment. From the various parameters expressed by this equipment, four parameters closely related to patient shock were used as the input data for a machine learning model in order to detect the shock. Using the four parameters as input data, that is, feature values, a random forest-based ensemble machine learning model was constructed. The value of the mean arterial pressure was used as the correct answer value, the so called label value, to detect the patient’s shock state. The performance was then compared with the decision tree and logistic regression model using a confusion matrix. The average accuracy of the random forest model was 92.80%, which shows superior performance compared to other models. We look forward to our work playing a role in helping medical staff by making recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of complex and difficult cases of shock."

Therefore, in this paper, we tried to reset the current criteria for a special weather report which considers the regional characteristics and to predict the damage caused by rainfall after 1 hour. The study area was selected as Gyeonggi-province, where has more frequent heavy rain damage than other regions. Then, the rainfall inducing disaster or hazard-triggering rainfall was set by utilizing hourly rainfall and heavy rain damage data, considering the local characteristics. The heavy rain damage prediction model was developed by a decision tree model and a random forest model, which are machine learning technique and by rainfall inducing disaster and rainfall data. In addition, long short-term memory and deep neural network models were used for predicting rainfall after 1 hour.

Recent studies have demonstratedthat changes in speech may be utilized as an excellent biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD. In this study, we haveproposed a Chirplet transform (CT) based novel approach for diagnosing PD using speech signals. We employed CT to get thetime-frequency matrix (TFM) of each speech recording, and we extracted time-frequency based entropy (TFE) features fromthe TFM. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the TFE features reflect the changes in speech that occurs in the speechdue to PD, hence can be used for classifying the PD and healthy control (HC) individuals. The effectiveness of the proposedframework is validated using the vowels and words from the PC-GITA database. The genetic algorithm is utilized to selectthe optimum features subset, while a support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), andNaïve Bayes (NB) classifiers are employed for classification.

In this study, we propose to measure the user's indoor location using RSSI (received signal strength indicator). For this purpose, an indoor localization study was conducted by applying machine learning classifiers, SVM, decision tree, ExtraTrees, random forest, and KNN to RSSI data. Among the machine learning classifiers, random forest exhibited the best performance. Therefore, we applied random forest-based RFE to extract features from RSSI data.

In order to proactive identify students at risk of dropout, this study built a decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and deep learning-based dropout prediction model using academic data that can be easily obtained from each university’s academic management system. Their performances were subsequently analyzed and compared. The analysis revealed that while the logistic regression-based prediction model exhibited the highest recall rate, its f-1 value and ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve) value were comparatively lower. On the other hand, the random forest-based prediction model demonstrated superior performance across all other metrics except recall value. In addition, in order to assess model performance over distinct prediction periods, we divided these periods into short-term (within one semester), medium-term (within two semesters), and long-term (within three semesters). The results underscored that the long-term prediction yielded the highest predictive efficacy.

Notably, severe flood damage has been occurring in Asia along the Pacific coast dueto extreme weather events, including torrential rains and typhoons, which have beenbecoming increasingly frequent and prolonging the rainy season. In the Eastern Visayas region,the management and monitoring facilities for flood observation data, as well as the forecastingand warning systems suitable for the local area, are insufficient. The warning system introducedthrough overseas grants is limited in operation in some areas of the city. Furthermore, althoughan organization has jurisdiction over flood forecasting and warning, the system's operation isnot systematic and is limited. Additionally, there is a shortage of technical manpower. In thisstudy, we utilized deep learning models to forecast flood water levels in the CarayCaray Basinon Biliran Island, located in Eastern Visayas, the Philippines. Additionally, a flood riskclassification was applied to evaluate the degree of risk associated with the predicted waterlevels. The predicted water levels for each model were compared with the observed waterlevel data. The evaluation of the predictive performance of each model resulted in an NRMSEvalue of 9.48. Moreover, the accuracy of the DNN model was found to be the best among theflood water level prediction models. To implement the flood risk classification, we utilizedextreme gradient boosting, random forest, and decision tree models. The application of thesemodels resulted in an F1-score of 0.92 for the extreme gradient boost model, which exhibitedthe highest accuracy. With an increasing need for disaster (flood) management, AI-basedpredictive models are anticipated to reduce the damage caused by natural disasters andenhance disaster mitigation systems. Real-time collection of rainfall and water level dataenables continuous learning. Furthermore, if a clear flood warning based on learned floodlevel patterns is issued, preemptive measures can be taken before intense flood damageoccurs."

To enhance the fog detection level (10 min, 250 m), we developed afused GK2AB fog detection algorithm (FDA) of GK2A and GK2B. The GK2AB FDA comprises threemain steps. First, the Korea Meteorological Satellite Center’s GK2A daytime fog detection algorithm isutilized to detect fog, considering various optical and physical characteristics. In the second step, GK2Bdata is extrapolated to 10-min intervals by matching GK2A pixels based on the closest time and locationwhen GK2B observes the KorPen. For reflectance, GK2B normalized visible (NVIS) is corrected usingGK2A NVIS of the same time, considering the difference in wavelength range and observation geometry.GK2B NVIS is extrapolated at 10-min intervals using the 10-min changes in GK2A NVIS. In the finalstep, the extrapolated GK2B NVIS, solar zenith angle, and outputs of GK2A FDA are utilized as inputdata for machine learning (decision tree) to develop the GK2AB FDA, which detects fog at a resolutionof 250 m and a 10-min interval based on geographical locations.

Identifying specific reasons for judicial review of discretionary actions is necessary, as it influences the claims and evidentiary directions of the parties involved in administrative litigation and affects administrative authorities' actions. This study explores the possibility of quantitatively extracting individual judgment elements through attempts to concretize and typify the reasons for judicial review. As a premise for finding a quantitative method for judicial review criteria, Chapter 2 of this study collected and analyzed cases related to discretionary actions by building a database and utilized ChatGPT in the process. Although ChatGPT could not directly derive analytical results, it was confirmed that it could perform tasks that coding experts previously conducted and offer assistance in exploring analysis methods through question-and-answer interactions. Based on this analysis experience, Chapter 3 researched methods to schematize the principle of proportionality, a general judgment criterion for discretionary dispositions. The study expressed and coded the comparative magnitude of public and private interests using decision trees and considered ways to fill in each of the specific elements encompassed within public and private interests. We proposed how these criteria could be utilized in future judicial review outcome prediction systems and in arguments and evidence in actual trials. Quantifying the judgment factors by analyzing the judicial review criteria for discretionary dispositions of administrative agencies means filling in the reasons for judgments at the abstract level to a level that the general public can understand, thereby increasing the predictability of the court's judgments, enhancing trust in administrative precedents, and creating a meaningful link that can lead to reasonable discretionary dispositions and ultimately contribute to the advancement of the rights and interests of the people. In subsequent studies, artificial intelligence is used in the process of subdividing public and private factors and each subdivided element is quantified, so that anyone can understand the difficult discretion of the courts. Additionally, it is hoped that courts can deliver more rational and explainable decisions by being aware of the increasingly fine-grained aspects of judgment."

MLP 모델을 활용한 다중 보호 그룹 공정성 개선 기법,2023,"['데이터 중심 AI', '기계 학습 모델 공정성', '그룹 공정성', '편향 완화', 'Data-centric AI', 'Machine learning Fairness', 'Group Fairness', 'Bias mitigation']","사람과 밀접하게 관련된 분야에 기계학습 모델을 활용한 의사 결정이 적용되면서 기계학습 모델의 차별 문제가 주목받고 있다. 차별 문제는 성별, 인종 등과 같은 보호 속성기반으로 나누어진 보호 그룹 중 특정 보호 그룹이 기계학습 모델부터 차별적 예측을 받는 문제를 말한다. 기존 연구는 이진 보호 그룹 위주의 데이터 불균형 완화 기법으로 진행되었기 때문에 다중 보호 그룹을 위한 공정성 개선으로의 확장에 어려움이 있다. 따라서 본 논문에서는 다중 보호 그룹에 적용 가능하면서 기존 기계학습 모델의 공정성을 향상시키는 MLP 모델을 활용한 다중 보호 그룹 공정성 개선 기법을 제안한다. 본 기법은 MLP(Multi-Layer Perceptron)을 통해 보호 그룹을 예측하고 원 데이터 세트에 할당하는 보호 그룹 할당 모듈과 그룹 공정성 평가하는 공정성 평가 모듈로 구성된다. 공정성 평가는 이진 보호 그룹과 다중 보호 그룹으로 진행되며 균등 기회와 균등 승률 기반의 공정성 지표를 사용한다. 실험은 로지스틱 회귀, 랜덤 포레스트, 의사 결정 트리 모델과 공정성 분야에서 많이 사용하는 COMPAS, UCI Adult Census 데이터 세트를 사용하였으며 실험을 통해 데이터의 보호 그룹을 수정만으로 기존 기계 학습 모델의 그룹 공정성 향상을 확인하였다.","The use of machine learning models in fields closely related to human interactions has drawn attention to issues of discrimination. Discrimination refers to situations where specific protected groups based on attributes such as gender or race receive biased predictions from machine learning models. Previous research has primarily focused on mitigating data imbalances for binary protected groups, making it challenging to extend fairness improvements to multiple protected groups. Hence, this paper proposes a technique for enhancing fairness across multiple protected groups using an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model, capable of being applied to diverse protected groups while improving the fairness of existing machine learning models. This technique comprises two modules: the MLP Protected group Allocation module, which predicts the protected group using MLP and allocates it to the original dataset, and the Fairness Evaluation module, which assesses group fairness. Fairness evaluation is conducted for both binary and multiple protected groups, utilizing fairness metrics based on equal opportunity and equal odds. Experiments utilized logistic regression, random forests, decision trees, and commonly used datasets in the fairness domain such as COMPAS and UCI Adult Census. The experiments demonstrated that merely modifying the protected groups in the data can enhance the group fairness of existing machine learning models."
물질의 상태 분류에 대한 머신러닝 기반 교사교육 프로그램의 교육적 효과,2023,"['머신러닝', '인공지능', '물질의 상태', '분류', '과학교사', '교사교육', 'Machine learning', 'Artificial intelligence', 'State of matter', 'Classification', 'Science teacher', 'Teacher education']","목적  본 연구에서는 초·중등 과학교사를 대상으로 물질의 상태 분류에 대한 머신러닝 기반 교사교육 프로그램을 개발 및 실행하여 물질의 상태 분류 머신러닝 모델을 구축하였다. 그리고 모델의 평가 및 과학교사들의 경험을 질적 분석하여 프로그램의 효과성 및 과학수업에 머신러닝을 적용하는 것에 대한 과학교사들의 인식을 확인하고자 하였다.방법  이를 위하여 중부권 소재의 사범대학의 교육대학원에 재학 중인 초·중등 과학교사 31명을 대상으로 총 3회의 물질의 상태 분류 활동을 수행하고 의사결정트리 알고리즘을 적용한 머신러닝 모델로 구축하였다. 그리고 정확도, F1-score 등 모델 성능 평가를 통해 프로그램의 효과성을 확인하였다. 또한 과학교사들이 머신러닝의 적용에 대해 갖는 생각을 질적 분석하였다.결과  총 3회의 물질의 상태 분류 활동 동안 구축된 모델의 성능 평가 결과 정확도, F1-score 등의 값이 정적으로 증가하여 물질의 상태 분류에 대한 머신러닝 기반 교사교육 프로그램의 교육적 효과가 있는 것으로 판단되었다. 그리고 연구 참여자들의 머신러닝 모델 생성을 위한 데이터를 분석한 결과, 지식에 근거한 연역적 사고과정을 통해 물질의 상태를 분류하는 경우가 있음이 드러났다. 머신러닝 모델의 분류 성능을 비교한 결과 미시적 분류 기준보다는 거시적 분류 기준이 더 큰 영향을 주었으며, 물질의 사례별 연구 참여자와 머신러닝 모델의 분류 결과를 비교하였을 때 혼합물의 경우 불일치도가 증가하였다. 또한 질적 연구 분석을 통해 연구 참여자들이 머신러닝의 적용에 대해 갖는 생각을 ‘과학 개념의 생성 과정 체험’, ‘인지갈등’, ‘의사소통’ 등 9개의 주제로 도출하였다.결론  머신러닝을 과학교육의 탐구학습 방안으로 교사교육에 적극 도입하여야 하며, 머신러닝 기반 교육 프로그램을 토대로 귀납적 사고와 같은 과학적 추론 과정을 제대로 반영할 수 있는 교과서 등의 교육 자료가 개발되어야 하겠다. 그리고 혼합물을 물질의 상태 분류 학습에 포함시켜야 하는가에 대한 과학적 관점에서의 논의가 필요하다.","Objectives  In this study, a machine learning-based teacher education program for classifying the state of matter was developed and implemented for elementary and secondary science teachers and machine learning model for state classification of matter was established. And by analyzing the model evaluation and the experience of science teachers qualitatively, it was attempted to confirm the effectiveness of the program and the perception of science teachers about the application of machine learning to science classes.Methods  For 31 elementary and middle school science teachers enrolled in the Graduate School of Education at the College of Education located in the central region, a total of three matter classification activities were performed and a decision tree algorithm was applied to the machine learning model. And the effectiveness of the program was confirmed through model performance evaluation such as accuracy and F1-score. In addition, we qualitatively analyzed the thoughts of science teachers on the application of machine learning.Results  TAs a result of evaluating the performance of the built model during a total of 3 state of matter classification activities, it was determined that the accuracy and F1-score values increased statically, resulting in the educational effect of the Machine Learning-Based Teacher Education Program on the Classifying State of Matter. And as a result of analyzing the data of the study participants, it was revealed that there are cases in which the states of matter are classified through a deductive thinking process based on knowledge. As a result of comparing evaluation indicators of the machine learning models, the macroscopic classification criteria had a greater effect than the microscopic classification criteria. And when the classification results between the machine learning model and the research participants for various examples were compared, in the case of mixtures, the degree of inconsistency increased. In addition, through qualitative research analysis, the thoughts of science teachers on the application of machine learning were derived into nine topics, including ‘experience the process of creating science concepts’, ‘cognitive conflict’, and ‘communication’.Conclusions  Machine learning should be actively introduced into teacher education as an inquiry-learning method of science education. And educational materials such as textbooks that can properly reflect scientific reasoning processes such as inductive thinking should be developed based on machine learning-based education programs. And it is necessary to discuss from a scientific point of view whether mixtures should be included in the learning of Classifying State of Matter."
