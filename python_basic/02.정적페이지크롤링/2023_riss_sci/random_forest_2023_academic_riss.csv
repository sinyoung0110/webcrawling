랜덤 포레스트(Random Forest)의 시계열 적용에 관한 연구: 한국 물가상승률 예측 사례 분석,2023,"['random forest', 'bootstrap', 'inflation', 'forecasting', 'Machine learning', '랜덤 포레스트', '부트스트랩', '물가상승률', '예측', '머신러닝']","본고는 한국과 미국의 물가상승률 예측에 랜덤 포레스트 모형을 적용할 때, Stationary Bootstrap이나 Moving Block Bootstrap 등 Block Bootstrap을 사용하는 것이 통상적인 독립 부트스트랩(Independent Bootstrap)을 사용하는 것에 비해 통계적으로 유의한 수준으로 예측력을 개선하지는 못한다는 것을 보인다. 그리고 FRED-MD를 참고한 총 93개의 관련 국내외 거시경제/금융 변수들을 사용하고, XGBoost, LSTM 등 다양한 머신러닝 방법을 활용하여 한국의 물가상승률을예측하고 분석한다. 2004년 9월에서 2022년 3월까지의 표본을 이용하였고, 1개월에서 12개월의 예측 대상기간(Forecast Horizon)을 고려하였다. 총 13개의 모형 중 대부분의 예측 대상기간에 있어 예측력이 우수한 모형이 존재하는 것으로나타났는데, 이는 보루타 알고리즘(Boruta Algorism)을 통해 중요한 변수로 분류된 변수들만을 랜덤 포레스트에 적용하는 모형이다. Giacomini and White(2006) 와 Hansen et al.(2009)의 검정을 통해 대부분의 예측 대상기간에서 통계적으로유의하게 예측력이 우수함을 확인하였는데, 특히 경제활동인구 및 취업자 수의증가율 등 고용시장 관련 변수, 기업경기실사지수, 주택가격 변화율 등이 물가상승률 예측에 중요한 변수로 선택되는 것으로 나타났다.","This paper first investigates whether adopting the stationary bootstrap or the moving block bootstrap, instead of the usual independent bootstrap, in the random forest method improves forecasting of stationary time series. It is shown that the block bootstrap procedures adopted in the random forest method do not make any statistically significant improvement in Korean or US inflation forecasting. Secondly, we consider inflation forecasting in Korea using 93 macroeconomic/financial variables and various machine learning methods. The samples are from September 2004 to March 2022. Comparing total 13 models, one model outperforms the rest models for most forecast horizons, which is a simplified method of the model proposed by Kim and Han (2022). The method consists of the following two steps: 1) Select important variables based on the Boruta algorithm, 2) Using only those selected variables, implement the random forest and produce a forecast. The tests by Giacomini and White (2006) and Hansen et al. (2009) show that the model provides significantly better forecasts for most forest horizons. In particular, the Boruta algorithm selected total economically active population, total employed persons, BSI, house price as important variables for Korean inflation forecasting."

While the emphasis on the importance of female employees within organizations is increasing, the existing research on internal communication has been insufficient in reflecting their specific characteristics. Accordingly, this study aimed to propose strategies to support female employees’ internal communication.Methods  Using a machine learning-based random forest, this study explored the validity of the factors identified in previous research that contribute to internal communication. Additionally, it proposed factors that were newly discovered through a predictive approach.

Specifically, it was confirmed that dimensions of leadership from direct supervisors, such as support for flexible work schedules, fairness, and listening, are key predictors of horizontal, upward, and downward communication among female employees.Conclusions  To cultivate effective internal communication among female employees, it is imperative to offer organizational support that encourages positive employee relationships and ensures competent leadership from direct supervisors. Moreover, the implementation of leadership training, the refinement of internal systems, and the enhancement of communication channels are essential for enabling personalized support between direct supervisors and female employees."
Dyeing Behavior of Enzyme and Chitosan-Modified Polyester and Estimation of Colorimetry Parameters Using Random Forests,2023,['Machine learning · Random forests · Surface modification · Polyester · Dyeing'],,"Dyeing of the crystalline structure necessitates a process with a disperse dye either at high temperatures or with a carrier dueto its compact and non-ionic structure of polyester. In this study, in order to eliminate these limitations and develop moreenvironmentally friendly dyeing processes, the dyeability of polyester under different conditions with reactive, direct, andacid dyes after surface modifications with enzyme and chitosan was investigated. In addition to the corresponding physicalexperiments, CIELAB and color strength values were also estimated using random forests. The results of the physical experimentsshowed that the surface modifications conducted with enzyme and chitosan significantly increased the color depthsobtained in dyeing for reactive, direct, and acid dyes, especially at pH 4.5. This was explained by the potentially protonatedamine groups in acidic medium of chitosan could have attracted large amounts of anionic dye molecules with physical forces.The highest color depths were obtained from acid dyeing. Washing fastness of the pre-treated and dyed fabrics (except theacid-dyed fabrics) decreased with the shift of the bath pH values to the acidic region. In the next phase of the study, weimplemented random forests to estimate CIELAB and color strength values. We considered different random forest designsand trained each design ten times to observe the performance of the corresponding topology. The results of the computationalexperiments showed that the estimation performance of the random forests is quite satisfactory (with R-values greater than99%) and random forests could be used to estimate CIELAB and color strength values successfully."
Ensemble Deep Learning Model using Random Forest for Patient Shock Detection,2023,"['Digital healthcare', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Random forest', 'MAP', 'Shock patient']",,"Digital healthcare combined with telemedicine services in the form of convergence with digital technology and AI is developing rapidly. Digital healthcare research is being conducted on many conditions including shock. However, the causes of shock are diverse, and the treatment is very complicated, requiring a high level of medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose a shock detection method based on the correlation between shock and data extracted from hemodynamic monitoring equipment. From the various parameters expressed by this equipment, four parameters closely related to patient shock were used as the input data for a machine learning model in order to detect the shock. Using the four parameters as input data, that is, feature values, a random forest-based ensemble machine learning model was constructed. The value of the mean arterial pressure was used as the correct answer value, the so called label value, to detect the patient’s shock state. The performance was then compared with the decision tree and logistic regression model using a confusion matrix. The average accuracy of the random forest model was 92.80%, which shows superior performance compared to other models. We look forward to our work playing a role in helping medical staff by making recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of complex and difficult cases of shock."

Prediction of forest fire risk according to climate change in Bhutan using a shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) scenario and random forest,2023,"['Forest Fire', 'Random Forest Model', 'Bhutan', 'Risks', 'Climate Change']",,"Forest fires destroy millions of forest acres globally, damaging ecosystem services, emitting carbon into the atmosphere, and causing billions of dollars in socio-economic losses, including loss of life. Bhutan, despite its small size, is grappling with forest fires compounded by climate extremes, a remote location, and a lack of preparedness. Under such conditions, it is important to develop policy, technology, and action to respond to forest fires based on scientific research. This study used the Random Forest model (RF) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) approach to create a model for predicting forest fires in Bhutan by considering climate data, spatial data, and forest fire occurrence factors. The RF algorithm was used to analyze the correlations between various input data and predict the change in future forest fire risk in Bhutan. Using SSP scenarios that considered changes due to future population and economic growth, it was possible to predict the risk of forest fires accurately and spatially in Bhutan. The study found that the average forest fire risk was highest during the months of October to January, which are also the dry seasons with low precipitation. However, it also showed high variability across climate change scenarios. SSP scenarios also confirmed the possibility of a significant increase in forest fire risk in the future.The results of this study can be used to support specific policy decisions for forest fire prevention and response in Bhutan and to contribute to the development of forest fire prediction technology in the light of the changing global climate."

A machine learning algorithm with random forest for recognizing hidden control factors from seismic fault distribution,2023,"['machine learning', 'synthetic fault distribution', 'random forest', 'principal component analysis']",,"Stress interaction among many faults in earthquake prone region is strongly affected by the spatial distribution of faults. To build a robust Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for finding hidden relationships between fault distribution and its controlling factors, the performance of ML in dependence of various parameters, such as the complexity and data size of the fault distribution, needs to be investigated. We have, therefore, developed an ML algorithm by combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a Random Forest (RF) to unveil the controlling factors on seismic fault distribution. We synthesized fault images for training of RF classifier ND (> 10,000) fault images, which scattered the faults in a square with R km R km. R, ranging from 200 km to 600 km, is a controlling factor of fault distribution. PCA extracts the dominant features of the seismic fault images to supply the refined training data to the RF. This leads to a dimensional reduction of the data. We tested the influence of the number of principal components (NP) on PCA performance in retaining the information. Larger and more variable R values (i.e., a more complicated fault distribution) with larger amounts of training data required more principal components for a full preservation of the original data. We quantified the optimized NP/ND ratio for an efficient RF classifier, which was about ~0.1 for the evaluating efficacy of the PCA. This showed that the RF classifiers is effective in predicting R values depending on the fault zone with R km × R km and not on specific fault locations. We propose that a small NP, equivalent to ~10% of the training data, suffices for training accurately RF classifier for fault distributions, which can reduce the complexity of fault distribution to understand stress interaction among many faults."

This work proposed a novel hyper-tuned ensemble Random Forest (Ens. RF) algorithm to detect false basic safety messages in IoV.  Performance evaluation was done using the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi) dataset comprising data-centric misbehavior evaluation for vehicular networks. For validation, a comparative analysis of the performance of the proposed “Ens. RF” model, five machine learning algorithms implemented in this work, and state-of-the-art ML models from related literature was presented. The performance metrics considered are time efficiency and validation accuracy for overall misbehavior classification. Also, the results confirmed the irrelevance of data balancing in real-life scenarios. Finally, we assess the performance of our proposed system for detecting each falsification scenario using precision and recall. The result shows that the proposed algorithm outperformed others with a validation accuracy of 99.60% and a negligible 604 misclassifications out of 153,730 points."
Research on Prediction of Dam Seepage and Dual Analysis of Lag-Sensitivity of Influencing Factors Based on MIC Optimizing Random Forest Algorithm,2023,"['Seepage prediction', 'Dam', 'MIC', 'Random forest algorithm', 'Influencing factors', 'Time lag']",,"The seepage of the dam is an important representation of the operation characteristics of thedam, and there are many factors affecting the seepage with a certain lag. It is still difficult topredict its change and sensitivity because of complex operating conditions. At present, the lagsensitivityof influence factors of the dam seepage has not been studied. The time seriesinfluence factors of seepage are determined by HTRT (hydrostatic-thermal-rainfall-time)model in this paper. To avoid the pseudo fitting of conventional methods, HTRT model nestedrandom forest algorithm is used to establish the predicting model of the dam seepage. AndMIC algorithm is used to achieve the dual purposes of time lag and sensitivity analysis. Firstly,the time lag of relationship between seepage and its influencing factors is characterized, andthe most appropriate lag time of the HTRT model factors is determined. Secondly, independentcorrelation analysis on all influencing factors is carried out and the sensitivity of each factor isanalyzed by MIC. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of the factors to seepage is quantitatively analyzedby the two parameters of %IncMSE and IncNodePurity of RF algorithm. The sensitivity ofinfluencing factors is analyzed by comparing MIC results with RF results. Combined with thecase, taking the error of fitting prediction as the evaluation index of seepage prediction, theprediction accuracy of MIC-RF model, RF model and MIC-BPNN (Back Propagation neuralnetwork) model is calculated and compared. Case study showed that MIC- RF monitoringmodel has high prediction accuracy, strong adaptability and high robustness in dam seepage,and the sensitivity and time lag of influencing factors can be quantitatively analyzed. Thewater pressure and rainfall of the lag time are 14 days and 16 days respectively. The sensitivitystudy of the time series influencing factors of seepage showed that the water pressurecomponent is the main controlling factor of seepage, and rainfall component is more sensitiveto later stage. The MIC-RF model can be used as a new dam seepage safety monitoringmodel."
Spatio-Temporal Variation of Soil Respiration and Its Association with Environmental Factors in Bluepine Forest of Western Bhutan,2023,"['carbon dioxide', 'spatio-temporal', 'moisture', 'temperature', 'soil respiration']",,"We investigated Soil respiration in Bluepine forest of western Bhutan, in relation to soil temperature, moisture content and soil pH and it was aimed at establishing variability in space and time. The Bluepine forest thrives in the typical shallow dry valleys in the inter-montane Bhutan Himalaya, which is formed by ascending wind from the valley bottom, which carries moisture from the river away to the mountain ridges. Stratified random sampling was applied and the study site was classified into top, mid, low slope and further randomized sample of n=20 from 30 m×30 m from each altitude. The overall soil respiration mean for the forest was found 2248.17 CO2 g yr-1 and it is ∼613.58 C g yr-1. The RS from three sites showed a marginal variation amongst sites, lower slope (2,309 m) was 4.64  mol m-2 s-1, mid slope (2,631 m) was 6.78  mol m-2 s-1 and top slope (3,027 m) was 6.33  mol m-2 s-1 and mean of 5.92  mol m-2 s-1, SE=0.25 for the forest. Temporal distribution and variations were observed more pronounced than in the space variation. Soil respiration was found highest during March and lowest in September. Soil temperature had almost inverse trend against soil respiration and dropped a low in February and peak in July. The moisture in the soil changed across months with precipitation and pH remained almost consistent across the period. The soil respiration and soil temperature had significant relationship R2=-0.61, p=0.027 and other variables were found insignificant. Similar relationship are reported for dry season in a tropical forest soil respiration. Soil temperature was found to have most pronounced effect on the soil respiration of the forest under study."

Thus, this study aims to investigate the role of different silvi- cultural interventions in enhancing the regeneration condition of selected ecological and economical important tree species. Three natural forests stands from different agro-ecologies were chosen and three silvicultural treatments including Fencing, Fence þ hoeing, Fence þ gap creation, and control (without any intervention) with 400 m2 plot areas estab- lished with three replications and randomized complete block design (RCBD) with a total of 36 plots. In each plot, seedling, and saplings under different mod of regeneration were recorded while height and diameter at breast height were measured and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics using R version 4.1. There was a significant difference (p < .05) in seedling density and regeneration status among forest stands, methods of regen- eration, silvicultural methods, and season of regeneration. The Camboo forest stand recorded the highest regeneration (971 seedlings ha1); seedlings regenerated from seed recorded the highest regeneration (368 seedlings ha1), fencing and gap creation silvicul- tural intervention recorded the highest seedlings (961 seedlings ha1), the highest regener- ation density was recorded at mid-rainy season (570 seedlings ha1); and Prunus africana and Albizia gummifera have the best regeneration capacity (245 seedlings ha1) in the study forest stand. The regeneration status of trees under fencing and gap creation plots changed from J-shape to an inverted J-shape before and after silviculture intervention, respectively.The regeneration and population structure of many studied tree species showed particularly good condition in fenced plots than control plots which shows future management inter- ventions for the restoration of degraded natural forest ecosystems in Ethiopia’s tropical for- est ecosystems. Some native tree species, such as Hagenia abyssinica, Apodytes dimidata, and Ekebrgia capensis, have a weak response to silvicultural treatments that require advanced regeneration techniques such as clonal nurseries and invitro propagation."
The Influence of Self-Guided and Guided Forest Therapy Program on Students' Psychological Benefits,2023,"['campus forest', 'college student', 'forest therapy']",,"Background and objective: University students' mental health is threatened by various stressors. Forest therapy is consideredan effective way to improve mental health. Many researchers have investigated the effectiveness of forest therapyprograms operated by guides. Recently, although the concept of a self-guided forest therapy program has emergedwithout a guide, research is insufficient. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the influence of self-guided andguided forest therapy program on students' psychological benefits.Methods: We employed a randomized 3 × 3 crossover study. Twenty-three university students were randomly assignedinto three groups to eliminate the order effect. Twenty-three university students were randomly exposed to threeconditions: a self-guided forest therapy program, a guided forest-therapy program, and routine activities. All participantsparticipated in all interventions once a week for three weeks, and each intervention was conducted over a one-weekwashout period to eliminate the carryover effect of the intervention. Measures included the Positive and Negative AffectSchedule (PANAS), the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES), and the Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS).Results: As a result, self-guided and guided forest-therapy programs significantly improved participants' negative emotionsand natural connectedness compared to routine activities. As for self-esteem, only a guided forest therapy program washigher than daily routine activities.Conclusion: This study shows that not only guided forest therapy programs but also self-guided forest therapy programshave a positive effect on psychological health. Therefore, these findings suggest that running guided forest therapyprograms and self-guided forest therapy programs as university in-campus programs will significantly help universitystudents' mental health."

Women were randomized into three arms, two arms received ultra-low dose pills (Ethinylestradiol [EE] 20 μg with drosperinone 3 mg or EE 15 μg with gestodene 60 μg) and one arm received low dose pill (EE 30 μg with desogestrel 150 μg). The role of baseline participant features and pill composition on discordance was determined.Results Discordance was observed in more than a quarter of the participants before intervention. After 1 year of treatment, less than a fifth of the participants were discordant. Ultralow-dose pill users had lower discordance, LDL, and TC than low-dose pill users after 1 year of treatment. The random forest, a non-linear classifier, showed the highest accuracy in predicting discordance.

This study aims to increase the success of direct seeding through the application of seed briquettes, aquasorb treatment and determining the right sowing time for three forest tree species, i.e. Ceiba pentandra, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Calophyllum inophyllum.This study used a randomized block design with two factorials (seed treatments and sowing dates) in each species. Seeds were sown in three blocks in the field according to the sowing time treatments. Each treatment consisted of 10 sowing plots in one block and 5 seeds or seed briquettes in each sowing plot. The results showed that direct seeding when the rain starts to stabilize (ST-2) supported by the use of seed briquettes and the addition of aqua- sorb was able to increase seedling survival, height and root collar diameter of all tested tree species. In general, seed briquettes and the addition of aquasorb provided better seedling survival and growth compared to direct seeding using untreated seeds. C. inophyllum gave higher seedling survival compared to the other two species indicating that this species is very prospective for direct seeding applications due to its high adaptability."

"Prediction of Larix kaempferi Stand Growth in Gangwon, Korea, Using Machine Learning Algorithms",2023,"['machine learning', 'forest thinning', 'volume growth', 'growth model', 'Larix kaempferi']",,"In this study, we sought to compare and evaluate the accuracy and predictive performance of machine learning algorithms for estimating the growth of individual Larix kaempferi trees in Gangwon Province, Korea. We employed linear regression, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM algorithms to predict tree growth using monitoring data organized based on different thinning intensities. Furthermore, we compared and evaluated the goodness-of-fit of these models using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The results revealed that XGBoost provided the highest goodness-of-fit, with an R2 value of 0.62 across all thinning intensities, while also yielding the lowest values for MAE and RMSE, thereby indicating the best model fit. When predicting the growth volume of individual trees after 3 years using the XGBoost model, the agreement was exceptionally high, reaching approximately 97% for all stand sites in accordance with the different thinning intensities. Notably, in non-thinned plots, the predicted volumes were approximately 2.1 m3 lower than the actual volumes; however, the agreement remained highly accurate at approximately 99.5%. These findings will contribute to the development of growth prediction models for individual trees using machine learning algorithms."
Genetic gain in oil productivity from breeding program of Cajuput (Melaleuca cajuputi subsp. cajuputi) in Indonesia,2023,"['essential oil', 'improved seed', 'selection', 'seed orchard', 'tree improvement']",,"A long-term breeding program of cajuput (Melaleuca cajuputi subsp. cajuputi) in Indonesia has aimed to increase oil productivity and quality through imposing selection for oil yield and 1,8-cineole content. This study examined the realized genetic gain for the two key varia- bles of oil yield, oil concentration and leaf biomass. Data were collected from a trial based on seeds collected from two unimproved, and two improved sources with selection inten- sities (IS) of 1.1 (10% of trees selected) and > 2.5 (<1% of trees selected). The trial was laid- out in a randomized complete block design with five replications. It was measured at 10 years of age. The leaf oil concentration of the IS >2.5 seed source was significantly higher than for the other sources; a realized genetic gain ranging from 14% to 31%. However, although not significant, this seed source had the lowest leaf biomass. The correlation between gains in oil concentration and leaf biomass was weak and not significant (r ¼ 0.15); while the correlation between oil yield and leaf biomass was very strong and highly significant (r ¼ 0.96). These results highlight the importance of carefully incorporating leaf biomass as a selection criterion in cajuput breeding programs aimed at increasing oil yield."

The aims to find out suitable agroforestry practice for saline soils of Khartoum State. And to investigate effect of tree spacing on forage biomass yield under semi -irrigated systems. Completely randomized block design with 3 replicates was conducted for this trial. Thus Z.spina-christi that fixed at 4×4 m was intercropped with cowpea at 1 m and 1.5 m spacing from trees trunk. Tree growth parameters were measured in terms of tree height, tree collar diameter, tree crown diameter and fruit yield per tree. While crop were parameters were determined in terms of plant height, number of plant, forage biomass yield per ha and land equivalent ratio. Soil profile of 1×1 m and 1.5 m depth was excavated and its features were described beside its chemical and physical properties were analyzed for 0-10 cm, 0-30 cm, and 30-60 cm and 60-100 cm layers. The results revealed that soil pH, CaCO3, SAR, ESP, and EC ds/m were increased by increasing soil depths. Meanwhile tree growth in terms of tree height was significant in the first season 2017 when compared with tree collar diameter and tree crown diameter. Also significant differences were recorded for tree growth when compared with sole trees in the second season in 2018. Tree fruit showed marked variations between the two seasons, but it was higher under intercropping particularly at ZS2. Crop plant height was highly significant under sole cropping than intercropping in first season in 2017. In contrast forage biomass yield was significant under intercropping in ZS1 and ZS2 treatments. Land equivalent ratio was advantageous under this agroforestry system particularly under ZS2. Thus it recorded 5 and 9 for ZS2 in the two consecutive seasons respectively. Therefore, it is feasible to introduce this agroforestry system under such arid lands to provide summer forage yield of highly nutritive value and low cost for animals feed as well as to increase farmers’ income and to halt desertification and to sequester carbon."

We introduce new variables such as employment rates, private consumption growth rate, consumer sentiment index, in addition to previous covered GDP, KOSPI, and WTI. This study applies random forest methodology, a supervised machine learning algorithm with correlation and multiple regression analyses to conduct multifaceted analysis. The random forest method is an intuitive and highly accurate algorithm to improve understanding of phenomena and produce meaningful results. Upon analyzing the macroeconomic determinants for air transport performance from 2002 to 2019, the results show GDP, government bond rates, and the KOSPI index have high positive correlations with air passenger demand and air cargo demand. Multiple regression analysis results confirmed that GDP and employement rate have a significant influence on air transport performance. Macroeconomic indicators have more explanatory power for air passenger demand, WTI and won/dollar exchange rate are also significantly influencing the passenger demand. Random forest analysis results demonstrate that WTI, won/dollar exchange rate, consumer sentiment index, GDP, and yen/won exchange rate are highly significant in air passenger demand. It is confirmed yen/won exchange rate variable emerges as a significant determinant of air passenger demand since 2013. In the analysis of air cargo demand, GDP is found to be the most significant factor, followed by government bond rates, won/yen exchange rate, WTI, and won/dollar exchange rate. The results show exchange rates’ increasing influence on the air transport industry performance since 2013.

Accordingly, the importance of advanced maintenance technologies through the predictions of age-induced deterioration degree, condition, and performance of bridges is more and more noticed. The prediction method of the safety grade of bridges was proposed in this study using the classification models of the Decision Tree and the Random Forest based on machine learning. As a result of analyzing these models for the 8,850 bridges located in national roads with various evaluation indexes such as confusion matrix, balanced accuracy, recall, ROC curve, and AUC, the Random Forest largely showed better predictive performance than that of the Decision Tree. In particular, random under-sampling in the Random Forest showed higher predictive performance than that of other sampling techniques for the C and D grade bridges, with the recall of 83.4%, which need more attention to maintenance because of the significant deterioration degree. The proposed model can be usefully applied to rapidly identify the safety grade and to establish an efficient and economical maintenance plan of bridges that have not recently been inspected."

In this study, we apply and compare deep neural networks with random forests and logistic regression, which have been widely used in previous studies, to predict variant pathogenicity. The experimental data consisted of 1,068 single-nucleotide variants in genes associated with hereditary cancers. Experiments on 100 random data-sets generated for hyperparameter selection showed that random forests performed best in terms of area under the precision-recall curve. On 15 holdout gene data-sets, deep neural networks performed best on average, but the difference in performance from the second-best random forest was not significant. Logistic regression was also statistically significantly worse than that of either model.In conclusion, we found that deep neural networks and random forests were generally better than logistic regression at predicting the pathogenicity of single-nucleotide variants associated with hereditary cancer."

Between 2012 and 2020, universities with low evaluation results in the government's university restructuring evaluation are defined as universities in business crisis. The goal was to discover factors that could predict a university in business crisis by using data such as students, faculty, and financial data, which are university components. As a result of the analysis, when using the Random Forest, it was possible to accurately identify universities in business crisis compared to the Logistic Regression model. The results of predicting universities in business crisis through shap analysis and statistical (t-test) are as follows. First of all, the ROC-AUC value that can evaluate the predictive power was checked by applying the logistic regression model and random forest to the same data for the prediction of universities in business crisis, and the logistic regression model was evaluated as 0.819 for universities and 0.854 for colleges. , Random Forest was evaluated as 0.927for universities and 0.943 for colleges. In the case of universities, the factors that have a positive(+) influence on the prediction of universities in business crisis are the dropout rate, region_Gyeongnam. On the other hand, the factors that have a negative(-) effect on the prediction of universities in business crisis are education expenses per student, education expense reimbursement rate, enrollment rate, maintenance recruitment rate, new student recruitment rate, employment rate, operating expense burden rate, and research expenses per full-time faculty member. In the case of colleges, the factors that have a positive (+) influence on the prediction of universities in business crisis are the carryover rate, teacher retention rate, region_Gangwon, dropout rate and debt ratio. On the other hand, the factors that have a negative(-) effect on the prediction of universities in business crisis are education expenses per student, student recruitment rate, university size, education expense reimbursement rate, maintenance recruitment rate, operating expense burden rate, new student recruitment rate, scholarship payment rate, and research expenses per full-time faculty member. The contribution of this study is to propose a new methodology to predict universities in business crisis using machine learning techniques, which are widely used recently."

The random forest model demonstrated excellent performance in carbonyl content prediction, surpassing the results obtained from the partial least squares model. To optimize the infrared spectral range for prediction, the spectral range was restricted from the entire range of 4000-400 cm-1 to the narrower range of 1800-1200 cm-1, known for its suitability in characterizing paper properties. This limitation enhanced the coefficients of determination of the model, increasing it from 0.921 to 0.937. A permutation variable importance measure was then applied to identify the key spectral regions contributing to carbonyl content prediction. The analysis pinpointed the 1650-1350 cm-1 range as a crucial region for accurate predictions.Subsequently, a new prediction model was built using data exclusively from this important region, yielding remarkably improved coefficients of determination of 0.960 and 0.965 for the raw and second derivative spectra, respectively. These findings affirm the validity and significance of the critical region identified by the permutation variable importance measure. The predictive performance of the established models is valid within the range of 7.2 to 29.4 μmol/g of carbonyl content in the training set."

To this end, the data of 8,169 participants in the 4th year supplementary survey of the Korea Education and Employment Panel Survey (KEEP2) were analyzed using the random forest method. The main research results are as follows. First, factors in the psychological/environmental category had less influence than factors in the categories of economic burden, important factors in employment, and job conditions. Second, wage/remuneration, working environment, aptitude, knowledge/skill acquisition, growth potential, social image, welfare benefits, employment stability, social value/contribution, and work-life balance had a high proportion of influence on the employment preference of young people. Third, as a result of examining the characteristic factors by company type, the preference for employment at large companies differed in wages/remuneration, working conditions, working environment, and academic background. The preference for SMEs was characterized by social value/contribution and cultural leisure-related working conditions. On the other hands, the preference for public institutions and government-related jobs was found to be employment stability and job conditions. In financial institutions and startups, cultural leisure and the working environment had a great influence on the difference in preference. Based on the above research results, the factors influencing the employment preference of young people were summarized and suggestions for follow-up studies were presented."

Recent studies on automatic scoring of essays are developing into studies using deep learning-based algorithms. However when automatic scoring is used in the field of education, deep learning-based algorithms have limitations because the interpretation and explanation of the scoring results must be possible. Therefore, in this study, we tried to develop a model that can interpret the scoring results by applying a machine learning-based algorithm that utilizes scoring features. In the essay, various parts of morpheme-based scoring qualities were derived, and the number of sentences was used. As a result, it was possible to derive a significant level of model performance. However, this study has a limitation in that it utilized basic quantitative feature such as parts of morpheme frequency and number of sentences.

Accurate prediction of flowering timing is crucial for effective forest ecosystem management. This study uses a process-based model to predict flowering timing in 2023 for five major tree species in Korean forests. Models are developed based on nine years (2009-2017) of flowering data for Abeliophyllum distichum, Robinia pseudoacacia, Rhododendron schlippenbachii, Rhododendron yedoense f. poukhanense, and Sorbus commixta, distributed acro ss 28 regions in the country, including mountains. Weather data from the Automatic Mountain Meteorology Observation System (AMOS) and the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) are utilized as inputs for the models. The Single Triangle Degree Days (STDD) and Growing Degree Days (GDD) models, known for their superior performance, are employed to predict flowering dates. Daily temperature readings at a 1 km spatial re solution are obtained by merg ing AMOS and KMA data. To impro ve prediction accuracy nationwide, random forest machine learning is used to generate region-specific correction coefficients. Applying these coefficients results in minimal prediction errors, particularly for Abeliophyllum distichum, Robinia pseudoacacia, and Rhododendron schlippenbachii, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 1.2, 0.6, and 1.2 days, respectively. Model performance is evaluated using ten random sampling tests per species, selecting the model with the highest R2. The models with applied correction coefficients achieve R2 values ranging from 0.07 to 0.7, except for Sorbus commixta, and exhibit a final explanatory power of 0.75-0.9. This study provides valuable insights into seasonal changes in plant phenology, aiding in identifying honey harvesting seasons affected by abnormal weather conditions, such as those of Robinia pseudoacacia. Detailed information on flowering timing for various plant species and regions enhances understanding of the climate-plant phenology relationship."

Accordingly, in this paper, the effect of the social activities of venture companies on sales was empirically analyzed through the Causal Forest method. Causal Forest is a machine learning model that allows the effect (treatment effect) of the variable of interest to be tested through causal reasoning after controlling several other characteristic variables that affect the objective variable through random forest modeling. As a result of empirical analysis using detailed survey data of venture companies from 2015 to 2020, it was confirmed that the social activities of venture companies had a significant average treatment effect (ATE) on sales. In addition, it was confirmed that the difference in the individual conditional average treatment effect (CATE) on the sales of social activities was significant depending on the size of the company's debt and the degree of investment activation. At this time, the treatment effect of companies with low total debt and low investment activation was widely distributed, which can be attributed to the characteristics of venture companies that focus on investment and technological innovation and show various corporate forms."

Therefore, a machine learning-based atmospheric correction algorithm was developed to simulate atmospheric correction from a radiative transfer model using Sentinel-2 data that have similar spectral characteristics as CAS500-4. The algorithm was then evaluated mainly for forest areas. Utilizing the atmospheric correction parameters extracted from Sentinel-2 and GEOKOMPSAT-2A (GK-2A), the atmospheric correction algorithm was developed based on Random Forest and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). Between the two machine learning techniques, LGBM performed better when considering both accuracy and efficiency. Except for one station, the results had a correlation coefficient of more than 0.91 and well-reflected temporal variations of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (i.e., vegetation phenology). GK-2A provides Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and water vapor, which are essential parameters for atmospheric correction, but additional processing should be required in the future to mitigate the problem caused by their many missing values.

Notably, both male and female students who were introduced to science-related books around the age of 10 and were presently exposed to scientific literature exhibited a higher likelihood of belonging to the high-achievement group. These findings will aid the development of tailored education support plans for high-achieving students, facilitating the success of these students to foster a scientific potential and brighter future."

As a result of comparing the predictive performance of the model, the method showed the best performance by predicting daily solar radiation with random forest, classifying dates with similar climate factors, and calculating the probability density function of solar radiation by cluster.In addition, when the prediction results were checked after fitting the model to the medium-term forecast data using this methodology, it was confirmed that the prediction error increased by date.This seems to be due to a prediction error in the mid-term forecast weather data.In future studies, among the weather factors that can be used in the mid-term forecast data, studies that add exogenous variables such as precipitation or apply time series clustering techniques should be conducted."

Hyper-personalization services involve several data integration, including external data. However, it also inherently possesses limitations in usage due to concerns about private information leaks, which can lead to damages to individuals and businesses and unnecessary societal losses. One approach to mitigate such security risks is to use homomorphic encryption, which protects private information. In particular, homomorphic encryption fundamentally prevents private information leakage during data integration and analysis processes and retains original data. In this study, we develop an algorithm for performing inference using an ensemble learning method with homomorphic encryption and apply it to real financial complaint data. We demonstrate the equivalence between scores obtained from random forest and XGBoost in plaintext and those derived from the homomorphic ciphertext. Empirical results show that the algorithm achieves inference computation times in approximately 0.4 seconds, confirming the potential utility of the tree-based ensemble learning method."

This can help the assessment of landslide susceptibility, because landslides are usually triggered by multiple factors, and the impacts of these factors vary by region. This study compared two stages of exploratory data analysis to examine the impact of the data exploration procedure on the landslide prediction model’s performance with respect to factor selection. Deeplearning-based landslide susceptibility analysis used either a combinations of selected factors or all 23 factors. During the data exploration phase, we used a Pearson correlation coefficient heat map and a histogram of random forest feature importance. We then assessed the accuracy of our deep-learningbased analysis of landslide susceptibility using a confusion matrix. Finally, a landslide susceptibility map was generated using the landslide susceptibility index derived from the proposed analysis. The analysis revealed that using all 23 factors resulted in low accuracy (55.90%), but using the 13 factors selected in one step of exploration improved the accuracy to 81.25%. This was further improved to 92.80% using only the nine conditioning factors selected during both steps of the data exploration.Therefore, exploratory data analysis selected the conditioning factors most suitable for landslide susceptibility analysis and thereby improving the performance of the analysis."

A typical encoder-decoder model, such as an autoencoder, transforms the encoder input into a latent vector and feeds it into the decoder. In this process, the encoder-decoder model learns to produce an decoder output similar to the encoder input. We can consider that the latent vector of the encoder-decoder model is well preserved by abstracting the characteristics of the encoder input. Further, it is possible to apply to unsupervised learning, if the latent vector guarantees a sufficient distance between clusters in the feature space. In this paper, the classification performance of latent vectors is analyzed as a basic study for applying latent vectors in encoder-decoder models to unsupervised and continual learning. The latent vectors obtained by the stacked autoencoder and 2 types of CNN-based autoencoder are applied to 4 kinds of classifiers including KNN and random forest. Experimental results show that the latent vector using the CNN-based autoencoder with a dense layer (about 97%) shows superior classification performance by up to 2% compared to the result of the stacked autoencoder (about 95%). Based on the results in this paper, it is possible to extend the latent vector obtained by using a CNN-based auto-encoder with dense layer to unsupervised learning."

In order to proactive identify students at risk of dropout, this study built a decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and deep learning-based dropout prediction model using academic data that can be easily obtained from each university’s academic management system. Their performances were subsequently analyzed and compared. The analysis revealed that while the logistic regression-based prediction model exhibited the highest recall rate, its f-1 value and ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve) value were comparatively lower. On the other hand, the random forest-based prediction model demonstrated superior performance across all other metrics except recall value. In addition, in order to assess model performance over distinct prediction periods, we divided these periods into short-term (within one semester), medium-term (within two semesters), and long-term (within three semesters). The results underscored that the long-term prediction yielded the highest predictive efficacy. Through this study, each university is expected to be able to identify students who are expected to be dropped out early, reduce the dropout rate through intensive management, and further contribute to the stabilization of university finances."

"Meta-Analysis on the Association between Echo Intensity, Muscle Strength, and Physical Function in Older Individuals",2023,"['Ultrasonography', 'Muscle strength', 'Physical functional performance', 'Aging']",,"Background: The use of ultrasonographic echo intensity (EI) to evaluate skeletal muscle quality and its effects on strength, explosive power, and physical function (PF) in older individuals remains unclear. This meta-analysis evaluated the associations among EI, muscle strength (MS), and PF in older individuals. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SPORT Discus, and CINAHL databases through October 2022 to identify primary studies examining the association between EI and MS/PF. Effect sizes were computed using a random-effects model and presented using forest plots. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and I2 statistics were used to measure heterogeneity. Results: This meta-analysis included 24 patients. EI demonstrated a negative association with maximal strength (r=-0.351; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.411 to -0.288; p<0.001) and explosive power (r=-0.342; 95% CI, -0.517 to -0.139; p=0.001) in older individuals. Handgrip strength also showed a significant negative correlation with EI (r=-0.361; 95% CI, -0.463 to -0.249; p<0.001). However, we observed only a small and non-significant negative association between EI and gait speed (r=-0.003; 95% CI, -0.083 to -0.077; p=0.943), and a weak non-significant correlation with the chair stand test (r=0.072; 95% CI, -0.045 to 0.187; p=0.227). Conclusion: Increased EI was associated with lower strength and power but not with gait speed or chair test performance in older individuals. Further large-sample studies with long-term follow-up are needed to improve frailty prediction and risk assessment in this population."

To mitigate over-fitting during the model training process, we employed stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Additionally, we searched suitable hyper-parameters, thereby implementing the optimal model.Following the training process, the random forest algorithm exhibited the highest prediction performance among all the models trained. The random forest model trained with the original imbalanced data achieved commendable AUC score of approximately 0.76. The performance of the random forest model trained with the oversampling imbalanced data showed significant improvement, reaching AUC score of 0.85. As a result of evaluating the importance of input variables, it was found that among 50 input variables, variables related to specialized major qualifications, such as ‘Engineer license_acquisition/non-acquisition’ and ‘crafts licenses’, had the greatest impact on whether or not to select trainees.The results of this study not only suggest the possibility of machine learning application research on MSHSs, but also show that the factors contributing to the effectiveness of MSHS policies in the educational field can be specified.

For gauged basin predictions, each model was calibrated or trained using observed daily runoff data, and their performance was evaluted over a separate validation period. Subsequently, ungauged basin simulations were evaluated using proximity-based parameter regionalization with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV). In gauged basins, the Random Forest consistently outperformed the GR6J, exhibiting superiority across basins regardless of whether they had strong or weak rainfall-runoff correlations. This suggest that the inherent data-driven training structures of machine learning models, in contrast to the conceptual models, offer distinct advantages in data-rich scenarios. However, the advantages of the machine-learning algorithm were not replicated in ungauged basin predictions, resulting in a lower performance than that of the GR6J. In conclusion, this study suggests that while the Random Forest model showed enhanced performance in trained locations, the existing GR6J model may be a better choice for prediction in ungagued basins."

Although the price volatility of carbon credit-related securities is less than that of stock prices, the volatility is still high on a monthly basis. KAU and REC transaction data were extracted from Korea Power Exchange (KPX). The data used for dependent variables in the analysis is the seven-year data from 2015 to 2022. Macroscopic variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and international oil prices were used as independent variables to predict transaction prices. Through decision tree analysis, a model with excellent performance by algorithm and parameter combination was first selected. As a result, the random forest generally shows higher performance than C4.5. However, parameters were adjusted in order to utilize C4.5, which has strengths in schematization of decision trees compared to random forests, and a model with a predictive rate comparable to that of random forests was selected. This paper suggests a schematic decision tree of KAU and REC in the preliminary experiment and could derive some decison rules to get optimal decision. This study has contributions in the following points. Several independent variables that affect carbon credits and REC price fluctuations were found. From this, we could draw the influence relationship between the target variable and the main independent variables. In addition, we could draw schematic diagrams that derive major rules and patterns through the decision tree method, moreover, it was possible to conduct multi-dimensional analysis for price prediction rather than mathematical modeling techniques."

Cervical protraction and retraction, which are key components of cervical spine motion, have been studied to assess their role in NSCNP. However, the existing research lacks quantitative assessments and explores nonlinear relationships.Purpose This study explored the relationship between cervical movements during protraction and retraction and NSCNP using machine learning (ML) techniques for classification.Study design Cross sectional study.Methods This study included 277 non-NSCNP and 463 NSCNP office workers. Data were collected from the musculoskeletal screening tests. Two-dimensional video analysis was used to track markers during cervical protraction and retraction. The head tilt angle (HTA), craniovertebral angle (CVA), head excursion angle (HEA), and protraction/retraction distances were measured. Six ML algorithms (random forest, neural network, decision tree, gradient boosting, logistic regression, and support vector machine) were employed to classify individuals with and without the NSCNP. The model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.Results Random forest performed best, with a test AUC of 0.800, followed by decision trees (0.790), and gradient boosting (0.701). Logistic regression and support vector machine had the lowest performance. CVA during retraction, CVA and HEA during protraction were significant predictors of NSCNP in the random forest model, indicating the importance of cervical retraction and protraction kinematics.Conclusions ML models can enhance our understanding of NSCNP and the role of cervical movements. These findings offer potential targets for assessment and intervention in NSCNP cases, and suggest the clinical utility of random forests for classification. Further research is needed to explore these relationships in diverse populations and investigate the underlying mechanisms."

However, in order to create a learning model, a process of generating training data by identifying features from original data and extracting feature values is required. The identified features represent the characteristics of the classification group well, and the greater the number of features, the higher the classification accuracy. However, the large number of identified features reduces the efficiency of generating a learning model when considering the time required to extract feature values. In order to search for the minimum set of feature combinations that guarantees a certain level of accuracy performance and can improve efficiency, this paper describes a method for searching for minimum scale feature combinations using feature importance, chi-square distribution, and PCA analysis. And, this is compared and evaluated through experiments using Random Forest and deep neural network algorithms."
Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction Model using Explainable AI-based Feature Selection,2023,"['Explainable AI', 'Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction', 'SHAP', 'Random Forest', 'XGBoost', '설명가능 인공지능', '기업부실예측', 'SHAP', 'Random Forest', 'XGBoost']",,"A corporate insolvency prediction model serves as a vital tool for objectively monitoring the financial condition of companies. It enables timely warnings, facilitates responsive actions, and supports the formulation of effective management strategies to mitigate bankruptcy risks and enhance performance. Investors and financial institutions utilize default prediction models to minimize financial losses. As the interest in utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technology for corporate insolvency prediction grows, extensive research has been conducted in this domain. However, there is an increasing demand for explainable AI models in corporate insolvency prediction, emphasizing interpretability and reliability. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique has gained significant popularity and has demonstrated strong performance in various applications. Nonetheless, it has limitations such as computational cost, processing time, and scalability concerns based on the number of variables. This study introduces a novel approach to variable selection that reduces the number of variables by averaging SHAP values from bootstrapped data subsets instead of using the entire dataset. This technique aims to improve computational efficiency while maintaining excellent predictive performance. To obtain classification results, we aim to train random forest, XGBoost, and C5.0 models using carefully selected variables with high interpretability. The classification accuracy of the ensemble model, generated through soft voting as the goal of high-performance model design, is compared with the individual models. The study leverages data from 1,698 Korean light industrial companies and employs bootstrapping to create distinct data groups. Logistic Regression is employed to calculate SHAP values for each data group, and their averages are computed to derive the final SHAP values. The proposed model enhances interpretability and aims to achieve superior predictive performance."

About 20% of respondents in the 20th presidential election could not decide their supporters until a week before the voting date. Considering that Ahn Cheol Soo resigned just before the election day, the percentage of votes for each candidate was predicted after classifying them through supervised learning. The supervised learning tools considered were logistic regression analysis, decision tree, and random forest measures. The Random Forest method showed the best performance in predicting the vote rate, and all measures similarly predicted the ratio of the vote rate of the first and second candidates. The accuracy of the prediction increased as the election date approached, but the prediction error at the time when the response rate was relatively low was very large. If the prohibition period for reporting public opinion polls is lifted and thus it is possible to classify respondents using data just before the voting day, the prediction of the vote rate using election polls is expected to be more sophisticated."
New Data Driven Scheme for Real-Time Power System Transient Stability Assessment,2023,"['Empirical wavelet transform', 'Power system transient stability assessment', 'Random Forest classifier', 'Synchrophasors technology', 'Teager–Kaiser energy operator']",,"A computational efficient and precise approach for real-time power system transient stability assessment (TSA), with post disturbance synchronized data is proposed in this paper. An empirical wavelet transform (EWT), Teager Kaiser energy changes (TKE) and Random Forest (RF) based new scheme is proposed to assess TSA. Based on the generator bus frequency and angles, a novel Robust Transient Stability Index (RTSI) is proposed to capture real-time status of power network. The EWT is utilized to decompose the proposed multi-component index into various intrinsic mode functions (modes). Subsequently, instantaneous energy change within each mode is calculated using Teager–Kaiser energy operator (TKEO). The energy changes in each mode defines decision boundary between transient stable and unstable operating scenario. Finally, for each mode, standard deviation of these energy changes is obtained to measure the variations in energy change about mean value. The Random Forest classification scheme is developed to obtain the TSA in real-time. The developed classifier predicts TSA using standard deviation of these energy changes. Simulation results and comparison with relevance minimum redundancy arithmetic, deep imbalanced learning framework and improved support vector machine methods demonstrates capability of the proposed scheme."

Among these, melon is a fruit loved by many consumers around the world, and predictions of its production and quality have great significance in the agricultural field. In particular, accurately predicting melon growth is an important factor in increasing agricultural economics and productivity. The purpose of this study is to utilize various machine learning techniques to accurately predict melon growth. The study was conducted based on melon growth and greenhouse environment data provided by the Jeollanam-do Agricultural Research and Extension Services. Initial data was collected in minutes, which were preprocessed and converted to daily averages. Additionally, because growth data were not measured at regular intervals, linear interpolation was used to fill in missing values. After completing data preprocessing and feature selection, learning was conducted using Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and GRU among several machine learning models. The performance of each model was evaluated by MSE and R² values. As a result, the random forest model showed the best performance. The brute-force method was used to select the optimal parameters for this model, and the MSE value of the random forest model using the optimal parameters derived through this was 2.33, showing high prediction accuracy. The results of this study are expected to significantly improve agricultural efficiency and productivity, and in the future, we plan to conduct research to further improve the accuracy of the prediction model by including more diverse variables and utilizing more data."

To achieve this, we intend to evaluate two factors that influence the prediction accuracy of the distribution model. In order to compare the prediction accuracy of the models based on biased location data in a specific region and based on the multicollinearity of environmental variables known as bioclimatic variables, the confirmed habitat locations of B. chalybea flavovittata were collected from the GBIF database, and 19 biological climate variables used as environmental variables were collected from the Worldclim database. The bias of the location data was examined using four types of data selected with a certain distance between the location data. The multicollinearity of the environmental variables was assessed using the Variation Inflation Factor (VIF). Preprocessed data were applied to seven species distribution models, and the prediction accuracy of the models was compared and analyzed using three evaluation metrics (Kappa, TSS, AUC). Among machine learning and regression models, seven distribution models were used for comparison. The machine learning models included Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and MaxEnt, while the regression models included Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). Overall, the prediction accuracy of the models was better explained by the Random Forest (RF) model, which is a machine learning method that better captures the complex relationship between species and environmental variables, compared to other models. The bias of location data, which is more commonly surveyed in easily accessible areas, affected the prediction accuracy in all models, while multicollinearity varied depending on the model. This study is expected to serve as fundamental guidance for developing an optimal species distribution model that aligns with the research objectives of species conservation and it can be utilized as foundational data for effective management of wildlife habitat in national parks."

The dropout rate was analyzed as the dependent variable. The final Random Forest and XGBoost models demonstrated the ability to explain 65% and 66% of the variability in the dropout rate, respectively. Using the two machine learning models, the top 10 explanatory variables were identified based on their importance, excluding the student enrollment rate. The models identified the following variables as important predictors of the dropout rate: expenditure per student for academic materials, research budget per full-time faculty member within the university, research budget per full-time faculty member outside the university, freshman enrollment rate, employee-to-student ratio, and employment rate. By examining the partial dependence plots of the five common important explanatory variables, it was analyzed how the predicted dropout rate changes in response to variations in these variables. Although there were differences in the curves between Random Forest and XGBoost, the overall direction and trends of the curves for the important explanatory variables were found to be similar. The improvement of these five important variables was found to have a negative correlation with the dropout rate, indicating a decrease in the predicted dropout rate.

In this respect, Moniz and Jong(2014) had studied the effect of the monetary policy communication of the Bank of England on the future market interest rate expectation of the market participants using the economic sentiment analysis. In detail, they had extracted the monetary policy themes, relating to economic growth, inflation, and market interests, from the minutes of the monthly monetary policy meeting of the Bank of England, and they had also extracted the economic sentiment words, such as positive or negative words among those monetary policy themes. Then they had created the economic sentiment index using these words. And with these data, they predicted the market interest rate, such as forward interest rates, using the various prediction models. Finally, they showed that the market interest rate prediction using these data reflected the significant change in the future interest rates.This paper also tried to reveal the usefulness of the sentiment analysis for forecasting of the market interest rates, supposed that the market participants would predict the future market interest rates using those information. Therefore, based on the Moniz and Jong(2014)’s technique, we studied if Korean market interest rates in the future would properly reflect those economic sentiments. For this purpose, this study, firstly extracted five monetary policy themes from the press releases of the Bank of Korea relating to the monetary policy decision in the every month during the period of 15 years, using the text mining method of Park and Kim(2022). And secondly, we extracted economic sentiment words from each monetary policy themes and created each economic sentiment index. Lastly we forecasted the future interest rates of a Convertible Deposit(maturity of three months) and Treasury Bond rate(maturity of three years) in one month later just after the date of the monetary policy decision of the Bank of Korea. As a forecasting method, we used machine learning method, such as support vector machine and random forest, and a deep learning method using simple neural nets in addition to a general linear regression method. And we included the average of the above all predicted interest rates as a predicted data. For the test of forecasting power, we segregated the whole data into two parts. One part is 75% of the whole data for the training of machine learning and deep learning models, and the other is 25% of the whole data for the test of the forecasting power. As a result of this analysis, we found that the interest rate forecasting power were much higher when the economic sentiment information was included. Among the forecasting methods, the machine learning methods had much higher forecasting power. Especially the random forest method had the better forecasting power among all forecasting methods. Lastly, the average of all forecasting results of every forecasting methods had the best forecasting power.As a result of this study, it is implied that the usage of economic sentiment analysis would be a better way of forecasting the future interest rates and the machine learning methods would be also helpful to forecast future interest rates. In addition, it is also implied that the sentiment analysis may be helpful for the study of forecasting the other market variables such as exchange rates and stock prices."

In this study, we propose a machine learning model that predicts the relative performance of fixed income funds one month out in order to help investors make portfolio choices. To verify the predictive power, we build a random forest model using performance data on fixed income funds from December 1, 2017, to January 31, 2023, as well as macro indicator data such as government bond interest rates, the won-to-US-dollar exchange rate, the domestic growth rate, and the consumer price index. The results of this study are as follows. First, the prediction results show accuracy and precision of more than 90%. Second, prediction power increases when characteristics are selected using BorutaPy, and third, cross-validation confirms the stability of the model. While most previous academic studies directly predict the price and return on investment from individual financial instruments, this study utilizes a classifier to guide the selection of relatively good performance groups. In this respect, it differs from previous studies. Therefore, this study is expected to indirectly help investors make investment decisions about fixed income funds. For future research, it is necessary to develop an optimal prediction model and to improve accuracy by comparing various machine learning models, such as deep learning and the support vector machine."

Currently,according to a number of global and national regulations, ships must be equipped with automatic identificationsystem (AIS), which provide information such as the location and speed of the ship periodically at regularintervals. However, most small vessels (less than 300 tons) are not obligated to install the transponder and maynot be transmitted intentionally or accidentally. There is even a case of misuse of the ship’s location information.Therefore, in this study, ship detection was performed using high-resolution optical satellite images that canperiodically remotely detect a wide range and detect small ships. However, optical images can cause false-alarmdue to noise on the surface of the sea, such as waves, or factors indicating ship-like brightness, such as cloudsand wakes. So, it is important to remove these factors to improve the accuracy of ship detection. In this study,false alarm was reduced, and the accuracy of ship detection was improved by removing wake. As a ship detectionmethod, ship detection was performed using machine learning-based random forest (RF), and convolutionalneural network (CNN) techniques that have been widely used in object detection fields recently, and ship detectionresults by the model were compared and analyzed. In addition, in this study, the results of RF and CNN werecombined to improve the phenomenon of ship disconnection and the phenomenon of small detection. The shipdetection results of this study are significant in that they improved the limitations of each model while maintainingaccuracy. In addition, if satellite images with improved spatial resolution are utilized in the future, it is expectedthat ship and wake simultaneous detection with higher accuracy will be performed."

Effect of the number of QTL of carcass weight on the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values in Hanwoo,2023,"['Hanwoo', 'QTL', 'GWAS', 'Random Forest', 'GEBV']",,"The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the number of QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) affecting the carcass weight of Hanwoo and the accuracy of GEBV (Genomic Estimated Breeding Values). The study was performed simulation study to generate three populations comprising 100, 500 and 1,000 QTL. Each population consisted of 13,500 individuals which were selected from the 6th to 10th generations of all 10 generations, while keeping litter size constant (N=1) in population parameters. The genetic parameters for these populations were set at 0.45 trait heritability, 0.3 QTL heritability and 48,578 total markers. In order to confirm the number of significant QTL under the threshold of Bonferroni correction, both GWAS (Genome-wide association study) and GWAS based on Random Forest (RF) were performed. In each population, there were 33, 50 and 32 QTL identified by only GWAS, with 100, 500 and 1,000 QTL. Additionally, RF-based GWAS detected 65, 260 and 491. These results showed that the number of significant QTL is not related to the overall number of QTL in the population. Furthermore, machine learning based GWAS is more accurate than solely using GWAS. To estimate the accuracy of GEBV (Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) in each population, 5-fold cross-validation was employed using SNP effect of the QTL over p-value. In the result of the estimation, GEBV rose with an increase in the number of QTL in the population, and the correlation between TBV (True Breeding Values) followed the same tendency.

As much as we rely on them, excessive smartphone use can cause physical and psychological problems in humans. This is called smartphone overdependence, and there is a lot of research on it. In this study, we proposed a smartphone dependency classification model using random forest, a machine learning technique, for the entire survey population based on survey data from the smartphone dependency survey conducted by the National Information Society Agency. Since the data on smartphone overdependence is imbalanced and the percentage of smartphone overdependence is very small compared to the general users, we utilized the oversampling technique to overcome this, and showed excellent classification rate, sensitivity, and specificity by increasing the percentage of smartphone overdependence by 2, 3, and 4 times. We found that the most influential variable in the classification of smartphone dependence was the use of smartphones for leisure pursuits such as playing games, watching movies, and watching videos. We may all be heading towards a naturalized smartphone dependency. We may need to relax the strict criteria for smartphone dependence in the past to accept and improve the current situation."

The purpose of this study is to propose a methodology for selecting drowsiness hotspots using continuous driving time, a variable that quantifies driver fatigue.METHODS : An analysis was conducted by dividing driver fatigue, which changes according to time and space, into temporal and spatiotemporal scenarios. The analysis technique derived four evaluation indicators (precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score) using a random forest classification model that is effective for processing large amounts of data.RESULTS : Both the temporal and spatiotemporal scenarios performed better in models that reflected the characteristics of road sections with changes in time and space. Comparing the two scenarios, it was found that the spatiotemporal scenario showed a difference in precision of approximately 10% compared with the temporal scenarios. In addition, [Model 2-2] of the spatiotemporal scenario showed the best predictive power by assessing the model’s accuracy via a comparison of (1-recall) and precision. This shows better performance in predicting drowsy accidents by considering changes in time and space together rather than constructing only temporal changes.CONCLUSIONS : To classify hotspots of drowsiness, spatiotemporal factors must be considered. However, it is possible to develop a methodology with better performance if data on individuals driving vehicles can be collected."
DEVELOPMENT OF A LIGHT AND ACCURATE NOX PREDICTION MODEL FOR DIESEL ENGINES USING MACHINE LEARNING AND XAI METHODS,2023,"['Diesel engines', 'NOx prediction model', 'Machine learning', 'Random forest', 'XAI']",,"In the previous research, we had developed a Nitrogen Oxides emissions (NOx) prediction model using deep learning methodology. However, it is necessary to develop a lightweight model for practical application. We developed a machine learning model for predicting NOx using Random Forest method to reduce the negligible input features. For comparison, a Base model was developed with all features. The Shapley Additive Explanations method, which can show the influence of the input features, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient method, which can show the proportional relationship between the output and the input values, were used to choose the dominant features. The final model was determined using the Shapley Additive Explanations method. The final model shows similar prediction performance to the base model, though it has only 11 features (30 % of the Base model). The final model shows 15.76 for the root mean square error and 0.965 for R2 with the test data. By extracting the dominant features influencing NOx prediction, we could develop a lightweight and accurate NOx prediction model."
Estimating Indoor Radio Environment Maps with Mobile Robots and Machine Learning,2023,"['Radio Environment Map', 'Mobile Robot', 'machine learning', 'Random Forest Regression', 'Extra Tree Regressior', 'DecisionTreeRegressor']",,"Wireless communication technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in smart factories, but the rise in the number of wireless devices can lead to interference in the ISM band and obstacles like metal blocks within the factory can weaken communication signals, creating radio shadow areas that impede information exchange. Consequently, accurately determining the radio communication coverage range is crucial. To address this issue, a Radio Environment Map (REM) can be used to provide information about the radio environment in a specific area. In this paper, a technique for estimating an indoor REM using a mobile robot and machine learning methods is introduced. The mobile robot first collects and processes data, including the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and location estimation. This data is then used to implement the REM through machine learning regression algorithms such as Extra Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor. Furthermore, the numerical and visual performance of REM for each model can be assessed in terms of R2 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)."
Prediction and Feature Importance of Earth Pressure in Shields Using Machine Learning Algorithms,2023,['Earth pressure shields Earth pressure prediction Random Forest LightGBM Attention in BPNN Feature importance'],,"To reduce subjectivity and uncertainty when maintaining suitable earth pressure in earth pressure shields that can prevent heave or collapse, many prediction models using machine learning algorithms were proposed, but little research into the effects of other parameters on earth pressure has been undertaken, and soil conditioning parameters are always ignored. To establish a model with thorough parameters and probe into influences of other parameters, multiple machine learning algorithms were attempted. Given the accuracy, diversity and functions, random forest (RF), LightGBM and Attention-back-propagation neural network (Attention-BPNN) were further analyzed. Then, two RF models were compared in this research, one with soil conditioning parameters and the other without. Meanwhile, a case study was utilized to verify the reliability of the model. Finally, the feature importance of three models was compared and the variation rules of the most four important features were discussed by controlling variates. The results showed that soil conditioning parameters delivered a significant reduction in the prediction error. The case study demonstrated that the proposed model can satisfy engineering requirements. More earth pressure should give priority to increasing propulsion pressure, advance rate, and reducing foam air flow, rotational speed of screw conveyor, and vice versa."

Prediction of phishing websites using machine learning,2023,['Machine learning · Decision tree algorithm · Random forest algorithm · Gradient boosting and phishing websites'],,"With the growing popularity of the information science, more application is being integrated with websites that can be accessed directly through the internet. This has increased the possibility of attack by ill-legal persons to steal personal information. To identify a phishing assault, several strategies have been presented. However, there is still opportunity for progress in the fight against phishing. The objective of this research paper is to develop a more accurate prediction model using Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Classifiers (GBC) with three features selection techniques Extra Tree (ET), Chi-Square and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). Since phishing websites dataset contains 89 features, therefore we have applied extra tree and chi-square, feature selection method to identify the limited important features and then recursive features elimination technique has been used to reduce the dataset up-to optimum important features. We have compared the performance of the developed model using machine learning algorithms and find the best prediction performance using GBC, followed by RF and DT. These algorithmic models capture the trends from various cases of phishing with over R-square, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), in each case."

According to the World Health Organization, 795,000 Americans experience a new or recurrent stroke each year. Early detection of medical disorders, for example, strokes, can minimize the disabling effects. Thus, in this paper, we consider various risk factors that contribute to the occurrence of stoke and machine learning algorithms, for example, the decision tree, random forest, and naive Bayes algorithms, on patient characteristics survey data to achieve high prediction accuracy. We also consider the semisupervised self-training technique to predict the risk of stroke. We then consider the near-miss undersampling technique, which can select only instances in larger classes with the smaller class instances. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains an accuracy of approximately 98.83% at low cost, which is significantly higher and more reliable compared with the compared techniques."
Exploiting moving slope features of PPG derivatives for estimation of mean arterial pressure,2023,"['ABP', 'APPG', 'Moving slope', 'GridSearchCV random forest', 'MAP']",,"Monitoring Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) helps calculate the arteries’ flow, resistance, and pressure. It allows doctors to check how well the blood flows through our body and reaches all major organs. Photoplethysmogram technology is gaining momentum and popularity in smart wearable devices to monitor cuff-less blood pressure (BP). However, the performance reliability of the existing PPG-based BP estimation devices is still poor. Inaccuracy in estimating systolic and diastolic blood pressure leads to an overall imprecision in resultant MAP values. Hence, there is a need for robust and reliable MAP estimation algorithms. This work exploits the moving slope features of PPG contour in its first and second derivatives that directly correlate with MAP and does not require estimating systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. The proposed approach is evaluated using two different data sets (i.e., MIMIC-I and MIMIC-II) to demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the work for personalized non-invasive BP monitoring devices to estimate MAP directly. A mean absolute error of 1.28mmHgand a standard deviation of 2.50mmHgis obtained with MIMIC-II data-set using GridSearchCV random forest regressor that outperformed most of the existing related works."

The study predicted effective soil depth for two cases: three depths (shallow, normal, deep) and five depths (very shallow, shallow, normal, deep, very deep). Three classification models, including K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Deep Artificial Neural Network, were used, and their performance was evaluated by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results showed that the performance was in the high 50% to early 70% range, with the accuracy of the three classification criteria being about 5% higher than the five criteria. Although the grading criteria and classification model's performance presented in this study are still insufficient, the application of the classification model is possible in predicting the effective soil depth. This study suggests the possibility of predicting more reliable values than the current effective soil depth, which assumes a large area uniformly."

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores."

Our findings, aligned with previous research, confirm that the likelihood of /r/-dropping is significantly influenced by these factors. We also found that the probability of /r/-deletion is not solely governed by the individual position of an /r/, but by its relative position with another /r/. For instance, the first /r/ is predominantly dropped in unstressed coda positions when the succeeding /r/ is in a stressed onset, but the second /r/ is more prone to deletion where it is in an unstressed coda. Finally, key structures exhibiting high deletion probabilities of the first /r/ were identified, with certain patterns showing a notable tendency for the second /t/ to drop."

In addition, social losses are also increasing, such as the annual average increase of 1.6% in human damage and 2.4% in property damage due to house fires. In order to minimize social damage using big data technology, previous researches on various fire factor analysis have been conducted. In this paper, unlike previous big data-based researches that used numerical data such as distance, time, and area, discretized columns with categorical values were used for big data analysis to increase the accuracy of damage prediction. In this paper, we analyze the effects of categorical fire factors that affect human and property damage in residential fires. In our paper, one-hot encoding technique was applied to discretize categorical columns such as ignition heat source, ignition factor, initial ignition material, ignition related device, power source, ignition point, and combustion expansion product in the fire data of National Fire Agency.

But ‘peer relationship-negative’ and ‘academic helplessness-lack of positive emotions’ were to have a negative relationships with cooperation. Second, ‘social withdrawal’ was found to have a negative relationship and ‘teacher relationship-sensitivity’ was found to have a positive relationship with group promotion, and both ‘grit-perseverance of effort’ and ‘learning time-self-study’ were found to have a positive relationship with followership. In addition, ‘academic helplessness-lack of locus of control’ has a negative relationship and ‘grit-consistency of interest' consisting of negatively-worded items has a positive relationship with conflict resolution. Based on these results, this study presented educational implications and suggestions for follow-up studies related to the development of cooperation among middle school students by revealing major predictors that affect middle school students' cooperation."
Ensemble Gene Selection Method Based on Multiple Tree Models,2023,"['Ensemble Tree Model', 'Gradient Boosting Decision Tree', 'Gene Selection', 'ID3', 'Random Forest']",,"Identifying highly discriminating genes is a critical step in tumor recognition tasks based on microarray geneexpression profile data and machine learning. Gene selection based on tree models has been the subject ofseveral studies. However, these methods are based on a single-tree model, often not robust to ultra-highdimensionalmicroarray datasets, resulting in the loss of useful information and unsatisfactory classificationaccuracy. Motivated by the limitations of single-tree-based gene selection, in this study, ensemble gene selectionmethods based on multiple-tree models were studied to improve the classification performance of tumoridentification. Specifically, we selected the three most representative tree models: ID3, random forest, andgradient boosting decision tree. Each tree model selects top-n genes from the microarray dataset based on itsintrinsic mechanism. Subsequently, three ensemble gene selection methods were investigated, namely multipletreemodel intersection, multiple-tree module union, and multiple-tree module cross-union, were investigated.Experimental results on five benchmark public microarray gene expression datasets proved that the multipletree module union is significantly superior to gene selection based on a single tree model and other competitivegene selection methods in classification accuracy."

It seeks to identify the factors that influence the method of resolving public conflicts and determine which predictive factors are significant. To achieve this, machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines were employed to examine the factors affecting public conflict resolution. These methods consistently highlight the duration and type of public conflicts as critical variables in determining conflict resolution. By analyzing the specific importance of these variables, it becomes possible to predict the resolution method based on the duration of the conflict and whether the major participants are government or civilians. When combined with the number of participants, issues and nature of public conflicts, predictions become more reliable. However, model evaluations revealed the need for more detailed and precise data collection for future public conflict studies. Nevertheless, the models exhibited lower precision, recall, and accuracy than expected, suggesting that significant improvements are needed in various aspects. These improvements should focus more on expanding independent variables and providing a precise distinction for the dependent variable, rather than relying solely on machine learning techniques."

While existing scoring systems predict PJK, they predominantly offer a generalized 3-tier risk classification, limiting their utility for nuanced treatment decisions. This study seeks to establish a personalized risk calculator for PJK, aiming to enhance treatment planning precision.Methods: Patient data for ASD were sourced from the Korean spinal deformity database. PJK was defined a proximal junctional angle (PJA) of ≥ 20° at the final follow-up, or an increase in PJA of ≥ 10° compared to the preoperative values. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify independent variables. Subsequently, 5 machine learning models were created to predict individualized PJK risk post-ASD surgery. The most efficacious model was deployed as an online and interactive calculator.Results: From a pool of 201 patients, 49 (24.4%) exhibited PJK during the follow-up period.Through multivariable analysis, postoperative PJA, body mass index, and deformity type emerged as independent predictors for PJK. When testing machine learning models using study results and previously reported variables as hyperparameters, the random forest model exhibited the highest accuracy, reaching 83%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.76. This model has been launched as a freely accessible tool at: (https:// snuspine.shinyapps.io/PJKafterASD/).Conclusion: An online calculator, founded on the random forest model, has been developed to gauge the risk of PJK following ASD surgery. This may be a useful clinical tool for surgeons, allowing them to better predict PJK probabilities and refine subsequent therapeutic strategies."

This study utilizes the Household Energy Standing Survey published in 2022 and selects key household, housing, and appliance ownership and usage characteristics from the entire dataset. Afterward, the study applies Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers to classify the household’s monthly electricity consumption. The results suggest that the Random Forest classifier provides slightly better performances in general compared to the other models. Moreover, the feature importance suggests that the housing characteristics, such as the size of housing, and appliance usage information, and some household characteristics, such as the number of household members and household income, are relatively important features for classification. Although the study finds some evidence of the importance of household and behavioral information in understanding the household’s electricity consumption, the study also identifies the limitation of the survey dataset in extracting the behavioral information."

For example, because hospital data contains a variety of personal information, attempts to attack it have been continuously made. In order to safely protect data from external attacks, each hospital has formed an internal team to continuously monitor whether the computer network is safely protected. However, there are limits to how humans can monitor attacks that occur on networks within hospitals in real time. Recently, artificial intelligence models have shown excellent performance in detecting outliers. In this paper, an experiment was conducted to verify how well an artificial intelligence model classifies normal and abnormal data in network traffic data generated from medical devices. There are several models used for outlier detection, but among them, Random Forest and Tabnet were used. Tabnet is a deep learning algorithm related to receive and classify structured data. Two algorithms were trained using open traffic network data, and the classification accuracy of the model was measured using test data. As a result, the random forest algorithm showed a classification accuracy of 93%, and Tapnet showed a classification accuracy of 99%. Therefore, it is expected that most outliers that may occur in a hospital network can be detected using an excellent algorithm such as Tabnet."

The rill volume occupied about 78 % of the sediment volume, confirming that the contribution ofthe sediment from the rill erosion is greater than that of the interrill erosion. Although the rate of increase in rill order slowed as theslope increased, the total length and density of the rill generally increased. As the slope increased from 15° to 20°, the bed incisionof rills became larger than the sidewall expansion, and the rill sharpness increased by 1.6 times. The runoff coefficient on the lowerslope decreased by 12.3 % than that on the upper slope.

This suggests that median regression can have better predictive performance in emerging markets where there are likely to be outliers. Additionally, a gradient boosting machine (GBM) is found to be better than a traditional linear model both in prediction accuracy and portfolio performance. The hedged return from GBM is on average 2.89% per month with an annualized Sharpe ratio of 0.93 in the median regression.

The estimation results show that the duck curve phenomenon is not observed relatively well in summer, and it is prominent on weekdays in spring and autumn. If Jeju's meteorological forecast data and the forecast model proposed in this study are used, it is expected to contribute to stable electricity supply and demand by predicting Jeju's future electricity demand."

In this study, a preliminary study was conducted to develop a RIVPACS-type model suitable for Korean streams nationwide. Reference streams were classified into two types (upstream and downstream), and a prediction model for macroinvertebrates was developed based on each family. A model for upstream was divided into 7 (train): 3 (test), and that for downstream was made using a leave-one-out method. Variables for the models were selected by non-metric multidimensional scaling, and seven variables were chosen, including elevation, slope, annual average temperature, stream width, forest ratio in land use, riffle ratio in hydrological characteristics, and boulder ratio in substrate composition. Stream order classified 3,224 sites as upstream and downstream, and community compositions of sites were predicted. The prediction was conducted for 30 macroinvertebrate families. Expected (E) and observed fauna (O) were compared using an ASPT biotic index, which is computed by dividing the BMWPK score into the number of families in a community. EQR values (i.e. O/E) for ASPT were used to assess stream condition. Lastly, we compared EQR to BMI, an index that is commonly used in the assessment. In the results, the average observed ASPT was 4.82 (±2.04 SD) and the expected one was 6.30 (±0.79 SD), and the expected ASPT was higher than the observed one. In the comparison between EQR and BMI index, EQR generally showed a higher value than the BMI index."

Previous remote sensing research on North Korean tidal flats either fails to reflect recent trends or focuseson identifying and analyzing tidal flats. This study aims to quantify the impact of recent reclamation activities inNorth Korea’s coastal areas and contribute knowledge useful for determining the best remote sensing methodsfor coastal areas with limited accessibility, such as those in North Korea. Using Landsat-8 OLI images from2014–2022, we analyzed land cover changes in an area on the west coast of Pyeonganbuk-do where reclamationactivities are underway. Unsupervised classification using the normalized difference water index and the randomforest classification technique were each used to divide the study area into classification groups, and changes intheir areas over time were analyzed. The results show a clear decrease in the water area and a tendency to increasecultivated area, supporting the evidence that North Korea’s reclamation is for agricultural land expansion. Alongcoasts behind seawalls, the water area decreased by nearly half, and the cultivated area increased by over 2,300%,indicating significant changes and highlighting the anthropogenic nature of the cover changes due to reclamation.Both methods demonstrated high accuracy, making them suitable for detecting cover changes caused byreclamation. It is expected that further quality research will be conducted through the use of high-resolutionsatellite images and by combining data from multiple satellites in the future."

For the model performance evaluation, discharge and biochemical oxygen demand are selected as dependent variables out of nine measured parameters. Results showed that the performance of any machine learning algorithms was superior to their competitor LSTM. This is mainly attributed to a small amount of input data provided to the LSTM algorithm and unstable effluent wastewater characteristics. Meanwhile, hyperparameter tuning improved the performance of all tested algorithms. However, ensemble learning for machine learning and two-layer stacking for LSTM generally resulted in performance degradation as compared to that of single algorithms, regardless of dependent variables.

"Diversity and distribution of invasive alien plant species along elevation gradient in Makawanpur district, central Nepal",2023,"['altitudinal gradient', 'habitat types', 'plant invasion', 'specie richness']",,"Background: Knowledge of the spatial trends of plant invasions in different habitats is essential for a better understanding of the process of these invasions. We examined the variation in invasive alien plant species (IAS) richness and composition at two spatial scales defined by elevation and habitat types (roadside, forest, and cultivated lands) in the Makawanpur district of Nepal. Following an elevation gradient ranging from 500 to 2,400 m asl along a mountain road, plant species cover was recorded within sample plots of size 10 m × 5 m. Systematic random sampling was adopted in every 100 m elevation intervals on three habitat types.Results: Altogether 18 invasive alien plants belonging to eight families were recorded within 60 plots, of which 14 species (representing 80%) were from tropical North and South America. The most common plants by their frequency were Ageratina adenophora, Chromolaena odorata, Bidens pilosa, Lantana camara, and Parthenium hysterophorus. We found a significant relationship between species composition and elevation in the study area. Low-elevation regions had a higher number of alien species as compared to high-elevation regions within different habitat types.Conclusions: The species richness and density of IAS were higher in the road site followed by the cultivated land and forest sites. This pattern occurred throughout the elevation range and habitats. IAS were found mostly in the open land with high sunlight availability. Information from such scientific assessment of invasive alien plants will assist in developing appropriate management plans in the Makawanpur district."

We collected data through a field survey from randomly selected 335 households in the REDD+ pilot sites, including Kyauktaga and Minhla townships in Bago Province, Myanmar. The relationship between variables was analyzed using Structural Equation Model (SEM). The results showed that social capital has significant impact on poverty reduction. Specifically, social inclusion showed a direct impact on poverty reduction. While REDD+ activities such as education and CF membership had impacts on income generation, the impacts were insufficient to realize poverty alleviation. Forest dependents are relatively poor, which implies that forest activities are limited in achieving poverty alleviation through income level improvement. We found that the intervention of the REDD+ program on local communities may contribute to the accumulation of social capital, thereby reducing poverty."

The overall accuracy of the classification was as follows: XGBoost 0.53, RF 0.52, GBLUP 0.51. Sensitivity values were RF 0.98, XGBoost 0.97, GBLUP 0.19, and specificity values were GBLUP 0.83, XGboost 0.08, RF 0.05.

To achieve this, meta-information from 29 domestic and international mathematics education journals was utilized to construct a comprehensive academic research network in mathematics education.This academic network was built by integrating five sub-networks: 'paper and its citation network,' 'paper and author network,' 'paper and journal network,' 'co-authorship network,' and 'author and affiliation network.' The Random Forest machine learning model was employed to evaluate the impact of individual papers within the mathematics education research network. The SHAP, an XAI model, was used to analyze the reasons behind the AI's assessment of impactful papers. Key features identified for determining impactful papers in the field of mathematics education through the XAI included 'paper network PageRank,' ‘changes in citations per paper,’ ‘total citations,’ ‘changes in the author's h-index,’ and ‘citations per paper of the journal.’ It became evident that papers, authors, and journals play significant roles when evaluating individual papers. When analyzing and comparing domestic and international mathematics education research, variations in these discernment patterns were observed. Notably, the significance of 'co-authorship network PageRank' was emphasized in domestic mathematics education research.The XAI model proposed in this study serves as a tool for determining the impact of papers using AI, providing researchers with strategic direction when writing papers. For instance, expanding the paper network, presenting at academic conferences, and activating the author network through co-authorship were identified as major elements enhancing the impact of a paper. Based on these findings, researchers can have a clear understanding of how their work is perceived and evaluated in academia and identify the key factors influencing these evaluations.This study offers a novel approach to evaluating the impact of mathematics education papers using an explainable AI model, traditionally a process that consumed significant time and resources. This approach not only presents a new paradigm that can be applied to evaluations in various academic fields beyond mathematics education but also is expected to substantially enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of research activities."

Geostationary satellite images are very useful for active fire detection because they can monitor a vast area with high temporal resolution (e.g., 2 min). Existing satellite-based active fire detection algorithms detect thermal outliers using threshold values based on the statistical analysis of brightness temperature. However, the difficulty in establishing suitable thresholds for such threshold-based methods hinders their ability to detect fires with low intensity and achieve generalized performance. In light of these challenges, machine learning has emerged as a potential-solution. Until now, relatively simple techniques such as random forest, Vanilla convolutional neural network (CNN), and U-net have been applied for active fire detection. Therefore, this study proposed an active fire detection algorithm using state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning techniques using data from the Advanced Himawari Imager and evaluated it over East Asia and Australia. The SOTA model was developed by applying EfficientNet and lion optimizer, and the results were compared with the model using the Vanilla CNN structure. EfficientNet outperformed CNN with F1-scores of 0.88 and 0.83 in East Asia and Australia, respectively. The performance was better after using weighted loss, equal sampling, and image augmentation techniques to fix data imbalance issues compared to before the techniques were used, resulting in F1-scores of 0.92 in East Asia and 0.84 in Australia. It is anticipated that timely responses facilitated by the SOTA deep learning-based approach for active fire detection will effectively mitigate the damage caused by wildfires."

Therefore, in order to perform precise atmospheric correction for ultra-high-resolution satellite images such as CAS500-1, a machine learning-based approach that is excellent in terms of accuracy and speed is considered appropriate."
"High-resolution imaging coupled with deep learning model for classifying water body of Soyang Lake, South Korea",2023,"['classification', 'KOMPSAT', 'PlanetScope', 'Soyang Lake', 'U-Net']",,"Precise monitoring of natural phenomena is essential to reduce potential risk when a disaster occurs. The capability of developing high-resolution satellite images has provided advantages in the Earth’s surface observation. High-resolution images, including KOMPSAT-2/3 and PlanetScope images, have enabled more precise observation of the Earth’s surface. Combining the high-resolution KOMPSAT-2/3 and PlanetScope images and a capable image classifier tool can contribute to improving the confidence level of the observation. Recently, deep learning models provided enhanced capability compared to traditional machine learning, especially in image classification. In this study, we aim to investigate performance comparison between deep learning model using U-Net architecture and traditional machine learning represented by support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) model with a focus on identifying water bodies on a lake. Significant differences in surface area of water of Soyang Lake occurred in 2015 and 2022 was the area of interest of this study. Based on confusion matrix analysis, the best classification results were indicated by deep learning model represented by U-Net with overall accuracy  ranging from 97% to 100% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.91–1.00. The two traditional machine learning models, SVM and RF, lower up to 11% in overall accuracy and 0.15 for Kappa coefficient values. We also estimated the surface area of water based on the best classification results and found that the changes in water surface area were correlated with the monthly precipitation with a coefficient correlation of 0.89. This study should give new insight into the classification method for high-resolution satellite images. By providing the precise classification result, it could be contributed to providing proper mitigation and design policy related to natural phenomena on the earth’s surface, especially for monitoring the surface area of the lake water."
Comparison of different machine learning algorithms to estimate liquid level for bioreactor management,2023,"['Anaerobic digestion', 'Machine learning', 'Multicollinearity', 'Regression', 'Supervised learning']",,"Estimating the liquid level in an anaerobic digester can be disturbed by its closedness, bubbles and scum formation, and the inhomogeneity of the digestate. In our previous study, a soft-sensor approach using seven pressure meters has been proposed as an alternative for real-time liquid level estimation. Here, machine learning techniques were used to improve the estimation accuracy and optimize the number of sensors required in this approach. Four algorithms, multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function kernel were compared for this purpose. All models outperformed the cubic model developed in the previous study, among which the ANN and RF models performed the best. Variable importance analysis suggested that the pressure readings from the top (in the headspace) were the most significant, while the other pressure meters showed varying significance levels depending on the model type. The sensor that experienced both headspace and liquid phases depending on the level variation incurred a higher error than other sensors. The results showed that the ML techniques can provide an effective tool to estimate digester liquid levels by optimizing the number of sensors and reducing the error rate."

Study on the relationship between machining errors and transmission accuracy of planetary roller screw mechanism using analytical calculations and machine-learning model,2023,"['planetary roller screw mechanism', 'transmission accuracy', 'machining error', 'machine learning', 'analytical calculation']",,"Correlation between machining errors and transmission accuracy of planetary roller screw mechanism (PRSM) plays an important role in tolerance design. In this study, analytical calculations, machine learning, and experimental verification are utilized for exploring the internal correlation between the machining errors and the transmission accuracy of the PRSM. A multi-roller meshing transmission error model is established, which comprehensively considers the eccentric error, nominal diameter error, flank angle error, and cumulative pitch error of the screw, roller, and nut. The importance coefficients of various machining errors on the transmission error are determined using the random forest algorithm. A genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network algorithm-based method is utilized for training the dataset generated via analytical calculations. The results show that the proposed analytical calculation model reflects the alternate meshing characteristics of rollers during the PRSM motion, providing a more accurate prediction of the transmission error than the existing prediction methods. For an actual mean travel deviation, the most significant machining error is the cumulative pitch error of the screw, whereas for the actual bandwidth of useful travel, the most significant machining errors are the eccentric errors of the screw and nut. The proposed prediction formulae for transmission error considering the essential machining errors illustrate reasonable prediction accuracy, with an average error of 10.63% for the actual mean travel deviation and 14.27% for the actual bandwidth of useful travel compared with the experiments, which can effectively support the direct design of PRSM tolerance in engineering practice."
Missing body measurements prediction in fashion industry: a comparative approach,2023,"['Artifcial intelligence', 'Machine learning', 'Fashion and apparel industry', 'Anthropometric measurement', 'Sizing system']",,"The use of artificial intelligence to predict body dimensions rather than measuring them by stylists or 3D scanners permits to obtain easily all measurements of individual consumers and can consequently reduce costs of population survey campaigns. In this paper, we have compared several models of machine learning to predict about 30 measurements used in fashion industry to construct clothes from 6 easy-to-measure body dimensions and demographic information. The four types of models we have studied are linear regressions, random forests, gradient boosting trees and support vector regressions. To construct and train them we have used anthropometric measurements of 9000 adult individuals of the French population collected by the French Institute of Textiles and Clothing (IFTH) during a national measurement campaign collected between 2003 and 2005. We have analyzed the model prediction performance in terms of individual and global predictions as well as the effect of the training dataset size and the importance of the input features. The linear and the support vector regressions have given the best results with respect to evaluation metrics, predicted distributions and have required less training data than tree-based models. It turns out that the weight and height have been the most important input features for the models considered while the hip girth has been the less important among the input measurements. Since the set of body dimensions used in fashion industry and the morphology depend on the gender, we have decided to treat men and women separately and to compare them."

Furthermore, the appropriate management of small rivers has a significant impact not only on stable water supplies but also on water resource management. Wide monitoring of the riverside environment including land covers and their changes is an important issue in water resource management. This study aims to develop a high-resolution (10 m) model for classifying riverside land cover by integrating Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and terrestrial characteristics using machine learning algorithms. We constructed a total of 3,284 landcover reference point datasets near the four major rivers of South Korea with five classes: water, barren, grass, forest, and built-up. The Random Forest and Light Gradient Boosting Machine classification models were developed using eight input variables derived from SAR signal and digital terrain data. The models showed an overall cross-validation accuracy exceeding 80% while maintaining consistent spatial distributions, except for the barren class. The false alarms on barren would be corrected through additional sampling processes and incorporating optical characteristics in further study. The high-resolution riverside land cover maps are expected to contribute to the establishment of a comprehensive management system for water resources such as riverside land cover change detection, river ecosystem monitoring, and flood hazard management. Furthermore, the utilization of the next generation medium satellite 5 (C-band SAR) would improve the performance of riverside land cover classification algorithm in the future."

This intriguing linguistic pattern has motivated scholars to investigate potential markers for predicting the divergence of L1 and L2 texts. This study builds on this work, evaluating the feature importance ranking of specific translationese markers, including standardized type-token ratio (STTR), mean sentence length, bottom-frequency words, connectives, and n-grams. A random forest model was used to compare these markers in L1 and L2 academic journal article abstracts, providing a robust quantitative analysis. We further examined the consistency of these markers across different academic disciplines. Our results indicate that bottom-frequency words are the most reliable markers across disciplines, whereas connectives show the least consistency. Interestingly, we identified three-word lexical bundles as discipline-specific markers. These findings present several implications and open new avenues for future research into translationese in L2 writing."

In this study, we analyzed30000 traffic flow data points collected by traffic cameras at nearby intersections in Washington, D.C., USA from October 2012to May 2017, using Pearson’s heat map. We then predicted, analyzed, and compared the performance of the correlation betweencontinuous features by applying several machine-learning algorithms commonly used in ITS, including random forest, decisiontree, gradient-boosting regression, and support vector regression. The experimental results indicated that the gradient-boostingregression machine-learning model had the best performance."
3D 프린팅 소재 화학물질의 독성 예측을 위한 Data-centric XAI 기반 분자 구조 Data Imputation과 QSAR 모델 개발,2023,"['3D printing', 'Data imputation', 'Explainable AI (XAI)', 'Quantitative-structure activity relationship (QSAR)', 'Data-centric AI', 'Computational toxicology']",,"As accessibility to 3D printers increases, there is a growing frequency of exposure to chemicals associated with 3D printing. However, research on the toxicity and harmfulness of chemicals generated by 3D printing is insufficient, and the performance of toxicity prediction using in silico techniques is limited due to missing molecular structure data. In this study, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model based on data-centric AI approach was developed to predict the toxicity of new 3D printing materials by imputing missing values in molecular descriptors.First, MissForest algorithm was utilized to impute missing values in molecular descriptors of hazardous 3D printing materials. Then, based on four different machine learning models (decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, SVM), a machine learning (ML)-based QSAR model was developed to predict the bioconcentration factor (Log BCF), octanol-air partition coefficient (Log Koa), and partition coefficient (Log P). Furthermore, the reliability of the data-centric QSAR model was validated through the Tree-SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method, which is one of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. The proposed imputation method based on the MissForest enlarged approximately 2.5 times more molecular structure data compared to the existing data. Based on the imputed dataset of molecular descriptor, the developed data-centric QSAR model achieved approximately 73%, 76% and 92% of prediction performance for Log BCF, Log Koa, and Log P, respectively. Lastly, Tree-SHAP analysis demonstrated that the data-centric-based QSAR model achieved high prediction performance for toxicity information by identifying key molecular descriptors highly correlated with toxicity indices. Therefore, the proposed QSAR model based on the data-centric XAI approach can be extended to predict the toxicity of potential pollutants in emerging printing chemicals, chemical process, semiconductor or display process."

Therefore, the objective of this study is to discover an effective method for assessing the seismic vulnerability of buildings and conducting a density analysis of high-risk structures. The aim is to model this approach and validate it using data from pilot area(Seoul). To achieve this, two modeling techniques were employed, of which the predictive accuracy of the statistical analysis technique was 87%. Among the machine learning techniques, Random Forest Model exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, and the accuracy of the model on the Test Set was determined to be 97.1%. As a result of the analysis, the district rating revealed that Gwangjin-gu and Songpa-gu were relatively at higher risk, and the density analysis of at-risk buildings predicted that Seocho-gu, Gwanak-gu, and Gangseo-gu were relatively at higher risk. Finally, the result of the statistical analysis technique was predicted as more dangerous than those of the machine learning technique. However, considering that about 18.9% of the buildings in Seoul are designed to withstand the Seismic intensity of 6.5 (MMI), which is the standard for seismic-resistant design in South Korea, the result of the machine learning technique was predicted to be more accurate. The current research is limited in that it only considers buildings without taking into account factors such as population density, police stations, and fire stations. Considering these limitations in future studies would lead to more comprehensive and valuable research."

This study aimed to develop and externally validate a machine learning model that predicts pCR after NAC in patients with breast cancer using routinely collected clinical and demographic variables.Methods: The electronic medical records of patients with advanced breast cancer who underwent NAC before surgical resection between January 2017 and December 2020 were reviewed. Patient data from Seoul National University Bundang Hospital were divided into training and internal validation cohorts. Five machine learning techniques, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, and neural network, were used to build predictive models, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was compared to select the best model. Finally, the model was validated using an independent cohort from Seoul National University Hospital.Results: A total of 1,003 patients were included in the study: 287, 71, and 645 in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, respectively. Overall, 36.3% of the patients achieved pCR. Among the five machine learning models, the GBM showed the highest AUC for pCR prediction (AUC, 0.903; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.833–0.972). External validation confirmed an AUC of 0.833 (95% CI, 0.800–0.865).Conclusion: Commonly available clinical and demographic variables were used to develop a machine learning model for predicting pCR following NAC.

For developing the proposed model, 11,411 data points of adiabatic and condensing flow inside micro, mini and macro channels are collected from 80 sources. The database consists of 24 working fluids, hydraulic diameters from 0.07 to 18 mm, mass velocities from 6.3 to 2000 Kg/m 2 s, and reduced pressures from 0.001 to 0.95. Using this database, four machine learning regression models, including “artificial neural network”, “support vector regression”, “gradient boosted regression”, and “random forest regression”, are developed and compared with each other. A wide range of dimensionless parameters as features, “two-phase friction factor” and “Chisholm parameter” are each considered separately as targets.

Differences in Clinical and Immunological Characteristics According to the Various Criteria for Tissue Eosinophilia in Chronic Rhinosinusitis With Nasal Polyps,2023,"['Sinusitis', 'Nasal Polyp', 'Eosinophils', 'Classification']",,"Objectives. Several criteria exist for classifying chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) as eosinophilic or non-eosinophilic. This study attempted to evaluate several criteria for defining eosinophilic CRSwNP from clinical andimmunological perspectives.Methods. A cohort of 84 patients (73 patients with CRSwNP and 11 control patients) was retrospectively analyzed. Patientswere divided into eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic CRSwNP based on four different criteria: eosinophils (EOS) ac-counting for more than 20% of the total inflammatory cells; ≥70 EOS per high-power field (HPF); >55 EOS/HPF;and ≥10 EOS/HPF. Preoperative clinical characteristics, the immunological profiles of 14 cytokines from nasal tissue,and postoperative outcomes were compared between eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic CRSwNP based on each cri-terion. These criteria were immunologically validated by using 14 cytokines to predict the performance of tissue eo-sinophilia with a random forest model.Results. Patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP were significantly older when the criterion of ≥10 EOS/HPF or EOS >20%was used. The number of patients with aspirin intolerance was significantly higher in eosinophilic CRSwNP based onthe criterion of EOS >20%. From an immunological perspective, non-type 2 inflammatory cytokines were significantlyhigher in non-eosinophilic CRSwNP with the criterion of EOS >20% of the total inflammatory cells. In addition, thecriterion of EOS >20% of the total inflammatory cells resulted in the best prediction of eosinophilic CRSwNP, withan accuracy of 88.10% and area under the curve of 0.94.Conclusion. Clinical and immunological characteristics were different between eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic CRSwNPdepending on a variety of criteria, and the results of this study should be taken into account when choosing the crite-rion for defining eosinophilic CRSwNP and interpreting the data accordingly."

Miscibility of the polymer blends can be used to assess polymer–polymer interactions for effective scaffold engineering and cell–material interactions. The focus of this study was to apply machine learning (ML) methods to classify and predict the miscibility of polymer blends, namely poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-valerate)/fucoidan (PHBV/FUC), polyhydroxybutyrate/kappa-carrageenan (PHB/KCG), and cellulose acetate/polyamide (CA/PA). Physicochemical parameters assessed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis, and mechanical properties were used as input data. Depending on blend film compositions, the polymers were either partially miscible or completely immiscible. Six supervised classification algorithms were trained on the data with Scikit-learn. The random forest classifier outperformed the other algorithms with the optimal performance metrics. A simple multiple linear regression model was applied to polymer–drug interaction data. Preliminary results indicated that regression models could be correlated with ultraviolet (UV) absorbance of polymer–drug solutions."

To date, machine learning (ML) has been helpful in predicting continuous outcomes. The primary objective of the present study was to identify the factors correlated with ICP, while the secondary objective was to compare the predictive performances among linear, non-linear, and ML regression models for ICP prediction. Methods: A total of 412 patients with various types of HCP who had undergone ventriculostomy was retrospectively included in the present study, and intraoperative ICP was recorded following ventricular catheter insertion. Several clinical factors and imaging parameters were analyzed for the relationship with ICP by linear correlation. The predictive performance of ICP was compared among linear, non-linear, and ML regression models. Results: Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) had a moderately positive correlation with ICP (r=0.530, P<0.001), while several ventricular indexes were not statistically significant in correlation with ICP. For prediction of ICP, random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms had low mean absolute error and root mean square error values and high R2 values compared to linear and non-linear regression when the predictive model included ONSD and ventricular indexes. Conclusions: The XGBoost and RF algorithms are advantageous for predicting preoperative ICP and establishing prognoses for HCP patients. Furthermore, ML-based prediction could be used as a non-invasive method."

A Prediction Model for Osteoporosis Risk Using a Machine-Learning Approach and Its Validation in a Large Cohort,2023,"['Osteoporosis', 'Genetic Risk Scores', 'Machine Learning', 'XGboost', 'Deep Neural Network', 'Nutrient Intake', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy']",,"Background: Osteoporosis develops in the elderly due to decreased bone mineral density (BMD), potentially increasing bone fracture risk. However, the BMD is not regularly measured in a clinical setting. This study aimed to develop a good prediction model for the osteoporosis risk using a machine learning (ML) approach in adults over 40 years in the Ansan/Anseong cohort and the association of predicted osteoporosis risk with a fracture in the Health Examinees (HEXA) cohort.Methods: The 109 demographic, anthropometric, biochemical, genetic, nutrient, and lifestyle variables of 8,842 participants were manually selected in an Ansan/Anseong cohort and included in the ML algorithm. The polygenic risk score (PRS) of osteoporosis was generated with a genome-wide association study and added for the genetic impact of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was defined with < −2.5 T scores of the tibia or radius compared to people in their 20s–30s. They were divided randomly into the training (n = 7,074) and test (n = 1,768) sets—Pearson’s correlation between the predicted osteoporosis risk and fracture in the HEXA cohort.Results: XGBoost, deep neural network, and random forest generated the prediction model with a high area under the curve (AUC, 0.86) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) with 10, 15, and 20 features; the prediction model by XGBoost had the highest AUC of ROC, high accuracy and k-fold values (> 0.85) in 15 features among seven ML approaches. The model included the genetic factor, genders, number of children and breastfed children, age, residence area, education, seasons to measure, height, smoking status, hormone replacement therapy, serum albumin, hip circumferences, vitamin B6 intake, and body weight. The prediction models for women alone were similar to those for both genders, with lower accuracy. When the prediction model was applied to the HEXA study, the correlation between the fracture incidence and predicted osteoporosis risk was significant but weak (r = 0.173, P < 0.001).Conclusion: The prediction model for osteoporosis risk generated by XGBoost can be applied to estimate osteoporosis risk. The biomarkers can be considered for enhancing the prevention, detection, and early therapy of osteoporosis risk in Asians."

Effects of Continuous Straw Returning on Soil Functional Microorganisms and Microbial Communities,2023,['Straw return · Enzyme activity · Microbial community · Degradability · Rice · Soil nutrients'],,"This study examined the changes in soil enzymatic activity, microbial carbon source metabolic diversity, and straw decomposition rates in paddy fields treated with 1, 2, or 3 years of straw returning (SR1–SR3). The soil’s ability to decompose straw and cellulolytic bacteria increased with the number of treatment years (1: 31.9% vs. 2: 43.9% vs. 3: 51.9%, P < 0.05). The numbers of Azotobacter, Nitrobacteria, cellulolytic bacteria, and inorganic phosphate bacteria increased progressively with the numbers of straw returning years. Cellulolytic bacteria and inorganic phosphate bacteria were significantly positively correlated with the decomposition rate (r = 0.783 and r = 0.375, P < 0.05). Based on 16S sequencing results, straw returning improved the microbial diversity of paddy soils by increasing unclassified bacteria and keeping dominant soil microorganism populations unchanged. The relative importance of individual microbial taxa was compared using random forest models.Proteobacteria, ammoniating bacteria, and potassium dissolving bacteria contributed to peroxidase activity. The significant contributors to phosphate monoesterase were Acidobacteriota, Desulfobacterota, ammoniating bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria, and potassium-dissolving bacteria. Proteobacteria, ammoniating bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria, and potassium-dissolving bacteria contributed to urease activity. Desulfobacterota, ammoniating bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria, and potassium-dissolving bacteria contributed to the neutral invertase activity. In conclusion, soil microbial community structure and function were affected within 2 years of straw returning, which was driven by the combined effects of soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, available potassium, and pH. With elapsing straw returning years, soil properties interacted with soil microbial communities, and a healthier soil micro-ecological environment would form."
Error Structure Analysis for Multiple Dual-polarization Radar using Ensemble Learning,2023,"['Dual-polarization radar', 'Ensemble learning', 'Error structure', 'Quantitative precipitation estimation']",,"Accurate quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) was essential for the prediction and prevention of natural disasters. Recently, radar has been attracting attention as a technique for performing QPE with high spatiotemporal resolution. In particular, the QPE was improved by introducing a dual-polarization technique that observed several hydrometeorological variables at various scales compared to the single polarization radar that utilized only the existing reflectivity-precipitation relationship. This study aimed to analyze the error structure of dual-polarization radar by predicting gauged rainfall using ensemble models. The location of the radar was Gwanaksan, Garisan, and Gwangdeoksan which belonged to the Bukhan river basin. The Pearson correlation coefficients between reflectance-precipitation and gauged rainfall were examined initially. After that, each gauged rainfall was predicted using ensemble learning, which included random forest (RF), gradient boost, and XGboost. Mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and R squared were evaluated as the predictive performance. Hyper-parameters were optimized by 5-fold cross-validation, and the reliability of the research results was obtained by 10 iterations. The result showed that RF had better predictive performance than other models. Gauged stations that operated at high altitudes were not good enough for the QPE because of the mountain effect. Due to the mountain range effect, the importance of the Gwanaksan radar at an altitude of 3 km was very high."
Determination of the stage and grade  of periodontitis according to the  current classification of periodontal  and peri-implant diseases and  conditions (2018) using machine  learning algorithms,2023,"['Classification', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Periodontitis']",,"Purpose: The current Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions, published and disseminated in 2018, involves some difficulties and causes diagnostic conflicts due to its criteria, especially for inexperienced clinicians. The aim of this study was to design a decision system based on machine learning algorithms by using clinical measurements and radiographic images in order to determine and facilitate the staging and grading of periodontitis.Methods: In the first part of this study, machine learning models were created using the Python programming language based on clinical data from 144 individuals who presented to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Süleyman Demirel University. In the second part, panoramic radiographic images were processed and classification was carried out with deep learning algorithms.Results: Using clinical data, the accuracy of staging with the tree algorithm reached 97.2%, while the random forest and k-nearest neighbor algorithms reached 98.6% accuracy. The best staging accuracy for processing panoramic radiographic images was provided by a hybrid network model algorithm combining the proposed ResNet50 architecture and the support vector machine algorithm. For this, the images were preprocessed, and high success was obtained, with a classification accuracy of 88.2% for staging. However, in general, it was observed that the radiographic images provided a low level of success, in terms of accuracy, for modeling the grading of periodontitis.Conclusions: The machine learning-based decision system presented herein can facilitate periodontal diagnoses despite its current limitations. Further studies are planned to optimize the algorithm and improve the results."
Analysis of Soil Characteristics and Inter-Annual Variability for  Rice Yield Distribution with Grid System for Precision  Agriculture,2023,"['Grid system', 'Precision agriculture', 'Soil physicochemical properties']",,"Precision agriculture relies on the uniformity of location-based agricultural environmental data, such as soil, weather, and sensing. In this study, we propose a grid system for precision agriculture to data spatial alignment. Based on this precision agriculture grid system, we analyzed the spatial distribution variability of annual soil chemical components and estimated rice yield distribution based on these components. The results from the years 2018 and 2019 showed that the average values of soil chemical components in non-paved areas exhibited no significant differences. However, even with the similarity in average soil chemical component values, we confirmed through spatial distribution maps that there can be diverse and biased distributions within the soil, as well as inter-annual variations. In the process of estimating rice yield using soil chemical components, the Random Forest model showed higher explanatory power and accuracy compared to the multivariate linear regression model. Both models, however, incorporated a wide range of chemical characteristics as model variables, beyond the key variables typically used in traditional rice fertilizer estimation. This diversity in model variables is presumed to be a result of the unique agricultural environment, such as uneven use of additional fertilizer. Therefore, it is crucial to emphasize that, even after calculating crop fertilizer quantities through soil analysis, stable yield and quality assurance require precision agriculture management based on crop growth monitoring."

In this study, a method combining Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA) technology and machine learning is proposed for lead-zinc mine borehole logging, which can identify lead-zinc ores of different grades and gangue in the formation, providing real-time grade information qualitatively and semi-quantitatively. Firstly, Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain a gamma-ray spectrum data set for training and testing machine learning classification algorithms. These spectra are broadened, normalized and separated into inelastic scattering and capture spectra, and then used to fit different classifier models. When the comprehensive grade boundary of high- and low-grade ores is set to 5%, the evaluation metrics calculated by the 5-fold cross-validation show that the SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor), GNB (Gaussian Naive Bayes) and RF (Random Forest) models can effectively distinguish lead-zinc ore from gangue. At the same time, the GNB model has achieved the optimal accuracy of 91.45% when identifying high- and low-grade ores, and the F1 score for both types of ores is greater than 0.9."

The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) currently uses the same criteria for all regions in Korea for watch and warning based on the maximum cumulative rainfall with durations of 3-hour and 12-hour to reduce damage. However, KMA's criteria do not consider the regional characteristics of damages caused by heavy rainfall and typhoon events. In this regard, it is necessary to develop new criteria considering regional characteristics of damage and cumulative rainfalls in durations, establishing four stages: blue, yellow, orange, and red. A classification model, called DSCM (Disaster Severity Classification Model), for the four-stage disaster severity was developed using four machine learning models (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost). This study applied DSCM to local governments of Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi Province province. To develop DSCM, we used data on rainfall, cumulative rainfall, maximum rainfalls for durations of 3-hour and 12-hour, and antecedent rainfall as independent variables, and a 4-class damage scale for heavy rain damage and typhoon damage for each local government as dependent variables. As a result, the Decision Tree model had the highest accuracy with an F1-Score of 0.56. We believe that this developed DSCM can help identify disaster risk at each stage and contribute to reducing damage through efficient disaster management for local governments based on specific events."
1시간 호우피해 규모 예측을 위한 AI 기반의 1ST-모형 개발,2023,,,"In order to reduce disaster damage by localized heavy rains, floods, and urban inundation, it is important to know in advance whether natural disasters occur. Currently, heavy rain watch and heavy rain warning by the criteria of the Korea Meteorological Administration are being issued in Korea. However, since this one criterion is applied to the whole country, we can not clearly recognize heavy rain damage for a specific region in advance. Therefore, in this paper, we tried to reset the current criteria for a special weather report which considers the regional characteristics and to predict the damage caused by rainfall after 1 hour. The study area was selected as Gyeonggi-province, where has more frequent heavy rain damage than other regions. Then, the rainfall inducing disaster or hazard-triggering rainfall was set by utilizing hourly rainfall and heavy rain damage data, considering the local characteristics. The heavy rain damage prediction model was developed by a decision tree model and a random forest model, which are machine learning technique and by rainfall inducing disaster and rainfall data. In addition, long short-term memory and deep neural network models were used for predicting rainfall after 1 hour. The predicted rainfall by a developed prediction model was applied to the trained classification model and we predicted whether the rain damage after 1 hour will be occurred or not and we called this as 1ST-Model. The 1ST-Model can be used for preventing and preparing heavy rain disaster and it is judged to be of great contribution in reducing damage caused by heavy rain."
머신러닝을 통한 잉크 필요량 예측 알고리즘,2023,"['Machine Learning', 'XGBoost', 'Ink Usage', 'Regression']",,"Research and interest in sustainable printing are increasing in the packaging printing industry. Currently, predicting the amount of ink required for each work is based on the experience and intuition of field workers. Suppose the amount of ink produced is more than necessary. In this case, the rest of the ink cannot be reused and is discarded, adversely affecting the company's productivity and environment. Nowadays, machine learning models can be used to figure out this problem. This study compares the ink usage prediction machine learning models. A simple linear regression model, Multiple Regression Analysis, cannot reflect the nonlinear relationship between the variables required for packaging printing, so there is a limit to accurately predicting the amount of ink needed. This study has established various prediction models which are based on CART (Classification and Regression Tree), such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, and XGBoost. The accuracy of the models is determined by the K-fold cross-validation. Error metrics such as root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared are employed to evaluate estimation models' correctness. Among these models, XGBoost model has the highest prediction accuracy and can reduce 2134 (g) of wasted ink for each work. Thus, this study motivates machine learning's potential to help advance productivity and protect the environment."

Analyzing the factors that trigger go-around events can aid in identifying measures that could lower their frequency. This involves circumstances that could be deemed abnormal and intrinsically harmful. The study employed the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a contemporary transparent model, to predict aircraft go-arounds and interpret different influential factors. The model proposed exhibits comparable accuracy to black-box models. The study utilized pilot reports and applied SMOTE-ENN to address the imbalance problem. The EBM model was trained with treated data in conjunction with Bayesian optimization. The EBM model's performance was evaluated using holdout data and compared to binary logistic regression and decision tree models, as well as black-box models such as adaptive boosting, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. The EBM model exhibited superior performance compared to other models in terms of precision (83.15%), recall (79.77%), geometric mean (77.29%), and Matthews’s correlation coefficient (0.453).

For VPD prediction, the correlation between the environmental elements in and outside the greenhouse and the temporal elements of the time series data was confirmed, and how the highly correlated elements affect VPD was confirmed. Before analyzing the performance of the prediction model, the amount and interval of analysis time series data (1 day, 3 days, 7 days) and interval (20 minutes, 1 hour) were checked to adjust the amount and interval of data. Finally, four machine learning prediction models (XGB Regressor, LGBM Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, etc.) were applied to compare the prediction performance by model. As a result of the prediction of the model, when data of 1 day at 20 minute intervals were used, the highest prediction performance was 0.008 for MAE and 0.011 for RMSE in LGBM. In addition, it was confirmed that the factor that most influences VPD prediction after 20 minutes was VPD (VPD_y__71) from the past 20 minutes rather than environmental factors. Using the results of this study, it is possible to increase crop productivity through VPD prediction, condensation of greenhouses, and prevention of disease occurrence. In the future, it can be used not only in predicting environmental data of greenhouses, but also in various fields such as production prediction and smart farm control models."

Extracted feature sets must be able to classify these logs into different bug categories with high accuracy, and low complexity. To perform these tasks, a wide variety of Machine Learning Models (MLMs) are proposed by researchers, and each of them varies in terms of their performance-level nuances, functional advantages, contextual limitations, and application-specific future scopes. Upon analyzing these characteristics, it was observed that existing models are highly context-specific, and cannot be applied to multidomain bug analysis datasets. Moreover, existing models do not incorporate a dynamic feature selection method, which limits their accuracy performance under multiple bug classification applications. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes design of a novel Ensemble deep learning Classifier with Feature Selection for high-efficiency Multidomain Bug Prediction under different use cases. The proposed model improves bug representation performance by combining multiple feature extraction methods, including GWO-based novel feature selection techniques. The ensemble classification model, which combines Deep Random Forest, k Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, and 1D Convolutional Neural Network classifiers, achieves higher accuracy, precision, recall, and low delay compared to existing models. The model also shows faster classification speeds than existing models and can be deployed for various real-time applications. This accuracy performance was compared with various state-of-the-art models, and it was observed that the proposed model showcases 4.5% higher accuracy, 3.2% better precision, 3.9% higher recall, and 5.5% faster classification performance, which was possible due to integration of intelligent feature selection process with high efficiency classification models under multidomain scenarios."

Data relevancy is investigated using feature extraction, hybrid outlier detection, and handling of missing values. Data instances that do not influence the target are removed using data envelopment analysis to enable reduction of rows. Column reduction is achieved by ranking the attributes through feature selection methodologies, namely, extra-trees classifier, recursive feature elimination, chi-squared test, analysis of variance, and mutual information. These methodologies are ranked via Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) using weight optimization to identify the optimal features for model building from the CKD dataset to facilitate better prediction while diagnosing the severity of the disease. An efficient hybrid ensemble and novel similarity-based classifiers are built using the pruned dataset, and the results are thereafter compared with random forest, AdaBoost, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. The hybrid ensemble classifier yields a better prediction accuracy of 98.31% for the features selected by extra tree classifier (ETC), which is ranked as the best by TOPSIS."

In the metal bush assembly process, the head diameter defect and placement defect of the metal bush occur due to metal bush omission, non-pressing, and poor press-fitting. Among these causes of defects, it is intended to prevent defects due to omission of the metal bush by using signals from sensors attached to the facility. In particular, a metal bush omission is predicted through various data mining techniques using left load cell value, right load cell value, current, and voltage as independent variables. In the case of metal bush omission defect, it is difficult to get defect data, resulting in data imbalance. Data imbalance refers to a case where there is a large difference in the number of data belonging to each class, which can be a problem when performing classification prediction. In order to solve the problem caused by data imbalance, oversampling and composite sampling techniques were applied in this study. In addition, simulated annealing was applied for optimization of parameters related to sampling and hyper-parameters of data mining techniques used for bush omission prediction. In this study, the metal bush omission was predicted using the actual data of M manufacturing company, and the classification performance was examined. All applied techniques showed excellent results, and in particular, the proposed methods, the method of mixing Random Forest and SA, and the method of mixing MLP and SA, showed better results."

Impact of Criterion Versus Norm-Referenced Assessment on the Quality of Life in Korean Medical Students,2023,"['Criterion-Referenced Assessment', 'Medical Education', 'Quality of Life', 'Stress', 'Burnout', 'Depression']",,"Background: Medical students are known to be subjected to immense stress under competitive curricula and have a high risk of depression, burnout, anxiety and sleep disorders. There is a global trend of switching from norm-referenced assessment (NRA) to criterion-referenced assessment (CRA), and these changes may have influenced the quality of life (QOL), sleep phase, sleep quality, stress, burnout, and depression of the medical students. We hypothesized that there is a significant difference of QOL between CRA and NRA and that sleep, stress, burnout, and depression are the main contributors.Methods: By administering an online survey regarding QOL and its contributors to Korean medical students, 365 responses from 10 medical schools were recorded. To clarify the complex relationship between the multiple factors in play, we applied nonlinear machine learning algorithms and utilized causal structure learning techniques on the survey data.Results: Students with CRA had lower scores in stress (68.16 ± 11.29, 76.03 ± 12.38, P < 0.001), burnout (48.09 ± 11.23, 55.93 ± 13.07, P < 0.001), depression (12.77 ± 9.82, 16.44 ± 11.27, P = 0.003) and higher scores in QOL (95.79 ± 16.20, 89.65 ± 16.28, P < 0.001) compared with students with NRA. Multiple linear regression, permutation importance of the random forest model and the causal structure model showed that depression, stress and burnout are the most influential factors of QOL of medical students.Conclusion: Medical students from schools that use CRA showed higher QOL scores, as well as lower burnout, stress and depression when compared with students from schools that use NRA. These results may be used as a basis for granting justification for the transition to CRA."

Notably, severe flood damage has been occurring in Asia along the Pacific coast dueto extreme weather events, including torrential rains and typhoons, which have beenbecoming increasingly frequent and prolonging the rainy season. In the Eastern Visayas region,the management and monitoring facilities for flood observation data, as well as the forecastingand warning systems suitable for the local area, are insufficient. The warning system introducedthrough overseas grants is limited in operation in some areas of the city. Furthermore, althoughan organization has jurisdiction over flood forecasting and warning, the system's operation isnot systematic and is limited. Additionally, there is a shortage of technical manpower. In thisstudy, we utilized deep learning models to forecast flood water levels in the CarayCaray Basinon Biliran Island, located in Eastern Visayas, the Philippines. Additionally, a flood riskclassification was applied to evaluate the degree of risk associated with the predicted waterlevels. The predicted water levels for each model were compared with the observed waterlevel data. The evaluation of the predictive performance of each model resulted in an NRMSEvalue of 9.48. Moreover, the accuracy of the DNN model was found to be the best among theflood water level prediction models. To implement the flood risk classification, we utilizedextreme gradient boosting, random forest, and decision tree models. The application of thesemodels resulted in an F1-score of 0.92 for the extreme gradient boost model, which exhibitedthe highest accuracy. With an increasing need for disaster (flood) management, AI-basedpredictive models are anticipated to reduce the damage caused by natural disasters andenhance disaster mitigation systems. Real-time collection of rainfall and water level dataenables continuous learning. Furthermore, if a clear flood warning based on learned floodlevel patterns is issued, preemptive measures can be taken before intense flood damageoccurs."

The approach and knowledge of the purpose of neonatal jaundice are restricted. Exploring the purpose of neonatal jaundice has superior significance in reducing jaundice-related infant mortality and morbidity. According to pudmed.com, case-control analysis is carried out and produces a medical chart of 272 infants for public healthcare units. Proper diagnosis of the disease is required to reduce the mortality rate. Computer vision techniques are essential to diagnose the disease. It can be done with the appropriate machine learning techniques. The existing system uses machine learning methodology to analyze the presence of disease. The severity level of the disease is determined by using a bilirubin meter. It may lead to poor performance due to a lack of severity level identification. Fifth, AdaBoost-Random Forest is carried out to identify the presence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Sixth, the CNN model was trained along with color-card techniques to identify their severity level.

기계학습을 이용한 광학 위성 영상 기반의 도시 내 수목 피복률 추정,2023,,,"Urban trees play a vital role in urban ecosystems,significantly reducing impervious surfaces and impacting carbon cycling within the city. Although previous research has demonstrated the efficacy of employing artificial intelligence in conjunction with airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to generate urban tree information, the availability and cost constraints associated with LiDAR data pose limitations. Consequently, this study employed freely accessible, high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (i.e., Sentinel-2 data) to estimate fractional tree canopy cover (FTC) within the urban confines of Suwon, South Korea, employing machine learning techniques. This study leveraged a median composite image derived from a time series of Sentinel-2 images. In order to account for the diverse land cover found in urban areas, the model incorporated three types of input variables: average (mean) and standard deviation (std) values within a 30-meter grid from 10 m resolution of optical indices from Sentinel-2, and fractional coverage for distinct land cover classes within 30 m grids from the existing level 3 land cover map. Four schemes with different combinations of input variables were compared. Notably, when all three factors (i.e., mean, std, and fractional cover) were used to consider the variation of landcover in urban areas(Scheme 4, S4), the machine learning model exhibited improved performance compared to using only the mean of optical indices (Scheme 1). Of the various models proposed, the random forest (RF) model with S4 demonstrated the most remarkable performance, achieving R<sup>2</sup> of 0.8196, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0749, and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.1022. The std variable exhibited the highest impact on model outputs within the heterogeneous land covers based on the variable importance analysis. This trained RF model with S4 was then applied to the entire Suwon region, consistently delivering robust results with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.8702, MAE of 0.0873, and RMSE of 0.1335. The FTC estimation method developed in this study is expected to offer advantages for application in various regions, providing fundamental data for a better understanding of carbon dynamics in urban ecosystems in the future."

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is widely recognized as the most effective treatment for OSA, which needs the proper titration of airway pressure to achieve the most effective treatment results. However, the process of CPAP titration can be time-consuming and cumbersome. There is a growing importance in predicting personalized CPAP pressure before CPAP treatment. The primary objective of this study was to optimize the CPAP titration process for obstructive sleep apnea patients through EEG feature engineering with machine learning techniques. We aimed to identify and utilize the most critical EEG features to forecast key OSA predictive indicators, ultimately facilitating more precise and personalized CPAP treatment strategies. Here, we analyzed 126 OSA patients' PSG datasets before and after the CPAP treatment. We extracted 29 EEG features to predict the features that have high importance on the OSA prediction index which are AHI and SpO2 by applying the Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method. Through extracted EEG features, we confirmed the six EEG features that had high importance in predicting AHI and SpO2 using XGBoost, Support Vector Machine regression, and Random Forest Regression. By utilizing the predictive capabilities of EEG derived features for AHI and SpO2, we can better understand and evaluate the condition of patients undergoing CPAP treatment. The ability to predict these key indicators accurately provides more immediate insight into the patient’s sleep quality and potential disturbances. This not only ensures the efficiency of the diagnostic process but also provides more tailored and effective treatment approach. Consequently, the integration of EEG analysis into the sleep study protocol has the potential to revolutionize sleep diagnostics, offering a time-saving, and ultimately more effective evaluation for patients with sleep-related disorders."
초고압 직류 송전 시스템이 있는 전력계통의 고장과 비고장 외란 구분: 소규모 데이터 기반 분류 접근법,2023,"['Classification', 'Fault', 'High voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system', 'Non-fault disturbance', 'and Power system response']",,"In power systems, faults, such as ground faults and short circuits, and non-fault disturbances, such as large load fluctuations and unbalances, occur frequently. However, the power system responses to power faults and non-fault disturbances are different.Therefore, it is essential to accurately distinguish between faults and non-fault disturbances in power systems. Previous studies have collected large-scale data by monitoring real-time parameters of the power system and detecting the occurrence of power system faults. However, this study does not focus only on diagnosing power system faults but also on accurately distinguishing between faults and non-faults disturbances and uses various classification models to train the data and evaluate and analyze the prediction results. Collecting power system parameters when faults and non-faults disturbances occur is not easy. Therefore, this study used DIgSILENT PowerFactory software to simulate faults and non-faults disturbances in the power system and collected 120 small data sets. The data collected for the 120 cases consists of various metrics such as voltage, current, frequency, rotor speed, and HVDC parameters. This study used seven classification models for training and prediction: decision tree, gradient boosting classifier, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, naive Bayes classification, and random forest regression. In addition, this study introduced an importance-based data reorganization method to improve the performance of the best-performing classification model and analyzed its effectiveness."

Favorable Immunotherapy Plus Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Outcome of Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients with Low CDK5 Expression,2023,"['Renal cell carcinoma', 'CDK5', 'Immune checkpoint inhibition plus tyrosine kinase inhibition', 'T-cell exhaustion', 'T cell dysfunction']",,"Purpose Immunotherapy (IO) plus tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has become the first-line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma, despite the lack of prognostic biomarkers. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) affects the tumor microenvironment, which may influence the efficacy of TKI+IO.Materials and Methods Two cohorts from our center (Zhongshan Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma [ZS-MRCC] cohort, Zhongshan High-risk Localized Renal Cell Carcinoma [ZS-HRRCC] cohort) and one cohort from a clinical trial (JAVELIN-101) were enrolled. The expression of CDK5 of each sample was determined by RNA sequencing. Immune infiltration and T cell function were evaluated by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Response and progression-free survival (PFS) were set as primary endpoints.Results Patients of low CDK5 expression showed higher objective response rate (60.0% vs. 23.3%) and longer PFS in both cohorts (ZS-MRCC cohort, p=0.014; JAVELIN-101 cohort, p=0.040). CDK5 expression was enhanced in non-responders (p < 0.05). In the ZS-HRRCC cohort, CDK5 was associated with decreased tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, which was proved by immunohistochemistry (p < 0.05) and flow cytometry (Spearman’s ρ=–0.49, p < 0.001). In the high CDK5 subgroup, CD8+ T cells revealed a dysfunction phenotype with decreased granzyme B, and more regulatory T cells were identified. A predictive score was further constructed by random forest, involving CDK5 and T cell exhaustion features. The RFscore was also validated in both cohorts. By utilizing the model, more patients might be distinguished from the overall cohort. Additionally, only in the low RFscore did TKI+IO outperform TKI monotherapy.Conclusion High-CDK5 expression was associated with immunosuppression and TKI+IO resistance. RFscore based on CDK5 may be utilized as a biomarker to determine the optimal treatment strategy."

It has the advantage of being available in both regression and classification problems, but it has the disadvantage that it is difficult to interpret the model due to its black-box characteristics. These shortcomings are supplemented by presenting a measure of variable importance, but this is only a relative value between explanatory variables, and there is a limit that the significance of each variable cannot be confirmed. On the other hand, in the case of the regression model, it is possible to test the significance of the variable through p-value and penalty. This study proposed a nonparametric variable selection method that tests the significance of explanatory variables based on the variable importance given in the ensemble technique. The simulation was conducted with eight models, and the results of sensitivity and specificity were compared by methodology. As a result of the simulation, the ensemble nonparametric variable selection showed better classification performance than the variable selection in the existing regression model in eight models. In addition, through case analysis, it was confirmed that the random forest nonparametric variable selection showed excellent performance even when there was a strong correlation between variables."

Discrimination refers to situations where specific protected groups based on attributes such as gender or race receive biased predictions from machine learning models. Previous research has primarily focused on mitigating data imbalances for binary protected groups, making it challenging to extend fairness improvements to multiple protected groups. Hence, this paper proposes a technique for enhancing fairness across multiple protected groups using an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model, capable of being applied to diverse protected groups while improving the fairness of existing machine learning models. This technique comprises two modules: the MLP Protected group Allocation module, which predicts the protected group using MLP and allocates it to the original dataset, and the Fairness Evaluation module, which assesses group fairness. Fairness evaluation is conducted for both binary and multiple protected groups, utilizing fairness metrics based on equal opportunity and equal odds. Experiments utilized logistic regression, random forests, decision trees, and commonly used datasets in the fairness domain such as COMPAS and UCI Adult Census. The experiments demonstrated that merely modifying the protected groups in the data can enhance the group fairness of existing machine learning models."

However, since vehicles and car owners are limited, if the shipper does not present an appropriate fare, the rate of allocation will decrease and making it difficult to secure car owners. It is also not easy for car owners to find the most suitable logistics at once amid numerous requests for logistics transportation in real time. For efficient dispatch, we study the dispatch contract process according to each position of the shipper and the car owner. For shippers, we suggest optimal fares with high dispatch probability according to fare decision factors, and check the probability of execution when the optimal fare is presented. For car owners, a personal model using random forest is built to narrow the their choice amid numerous shippers' cargo transport requests, and a customized cargo recommendation list is provided. New car owners use a group model built by grouping car owners with similar tendencies. In addition, in order to reduce the waiting time for car owners, we analyze a method of minimizing the distance that runs without loading. As a result, it is found that the average 29.771 km can be reduced."
