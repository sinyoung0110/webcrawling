"Effects of acetaminophen administration on liver histopathology, serum GOT/GPT levels and circulating microRNA-122 concentration in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus)",2016,"['Circulating microRNA-122', 'Acetaminophen', 'Olive flounder', 'Liver toxicity', 'Indicator']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In human medicine, circulating microRNAs have been successfully utilized as early biomarkers for various abnormalities and disease states. Vertebrate miR-122 is a liver-specific microRNA which is expressed almost solely in hepatocytes and plays an important role in the regulation of hepatocyte function. In this study, to evaluate the potential utility of circulating miR-122 as a biomarker for liver injury in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), fish were orally intubated with two doses of acetaminophen (500 mg/kg or 1.000 mg/kg of body weight), and the expression of miR-122 in serum was quantified using real time-PCR. Histological change in liver, and the enzymatic activity of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were also analyzed. The results showed that miR-122 was higher in acetaminophen administered groups compared to control group. The histopathological effect of acetaminophen on olive flounder liver was not distinct. The serum level of GPT and GOT was increased within 2 folds compared to control group by acetaminophen administration. However, the serum miR-122 level was increased more than 3 or 4 folds compared to the control group by administration of 1000 mg/kg of acetaminophen. These results suggest the possible use of miR-122 as an indicator of liver injury in olive flounder, even when histopathological effects are not distinctive."

We examined the effects of Cladosiphon okamuranus on the lipid metabolism in high-fat-diet rats. Seven-week-old female SD rats were divided into five groups and fed high-fat diets for 42 days. In addition, Cladosiphon okamuranus was administered orally for 42 days at 95 mg/kg of the body weight of the rats. The effects of lipid metabolism were evaluated by the total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT), glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) levels in sera. The levels of TC, TG, LDL, GPT, and GOT were reduced in the Cladosiphon okamuranus treated group compared with the high-fat diet group. However, the levels of HDL in the Cladosiphon okamuranus treated groups were higher than in the high-fat diet groups. These results demonstrated that Cladosiphon okamuranus had positive effects on lipid metabolism, suggesting Cladosiphon okamuranus could be used as an ingredient in useful, functional products."

Methods: Control bread was prepared using the same formula except for replacing the wheat flour with 3% citrus peel powder. Subjects were classified according to two groups: Intake group of 3% citrus peel powder fortified morning bread (n = 30) and general morning bread (n = 30). Results: The results of our study showed no significant effects of citrus peel powdered morning bread on anthropometric indices and biochemical characteristics among overweight adults. Despite the slight reduction in total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, GOT, and GPT (p < 0.05), no significant differences in changes of these values were observed between the two groups. Conclusion: The short duration of our intervention might have resulted in the lack of any significant effect. Therefore, conduct of further studies with longer duration is warranted in order that the results from this study can be utilized as a basis for the development of food products with citrus peel powder."

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling was carried out to demonstrate uniformity of the nose-only exposure chambers. Because it is very important in the inhalation toxicity experiments that test materials are distributed uniformly to each holder of the chamber. The test was done with these 3 types of chamber with different form to develop inhalation toxicity evaluation system, easy-to-operate system among exposure chamber used for evaluating inhalation toxicity of environmental chemical mixtures. Through CFD interpretation, nose-only exposure chamber was made with the selection of the optimal conditions. For its evaluation, one type of fragrance was selected and measured particle size distribution of each port. The gene becoming luminous to green fluorescence was combined with GPT-SPE, a type of tGFP vector, to be inhaled to the mouse. Based on this, luminous intensity was checked. As a result, total particle number concentration of each port had average value of $3.17{\times}10^6{\sharp}/cm^3$ and range of the highest and lowest concentration value was approximately ${\pm}4.8%$. Autopsy of lung tissues of mouse showed that it had clearly better delivery of gene compared to the control group."

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether ingestion of silkworm (Bombyx mori) pupae powder with and without resistance exercise training (isometric contraction training) increased muscle mass in ICR mice. To achieve this, 28 ICR mice were grouped into control (CON), resistance exercise training (EX), silkworm pupae powder ingested control (SP), and silkworm powder ingestion with resistance exercise training (SPEX) groups. The change in body weight ratio was significantly decreased in the EX and SPEX groups compared to the CON and SP groups. Total blood protein levels were the highest in SPEX mice compared to those in other groups. The albumin concentration increased only in the EX group. Blood GOT and GPT levels were not significantly affected. Changes in Akt and Gsk-$3{\beta}$ protein expression were not significant but there was a tendency for Akt to increase and for Gsk-$3{\beta}$ to increase following the ingestion of the powder. The size of the gastrocnemius muscle increased significantly in response to resistance exercise training only. Furthermore, the ingestion of silkworm pupae powder tended to increase muscle mass without significance. These results suggested that the ingestion of silkworm pupae powder with resistance exercise training might enhance muscle mass without hepatotoxicity. However, future study may be needed to obtained detailed results and practical suggestions."

Methods : Hypothyroidism was induced by intradermal injection with PTU for 4 weeks in SD rats. ALRP extract or L-thyroxine as a control drug was orally administrated for 2 weeks with PTU injection in rats. The physiological and serological parameters were measured in rats. The histological change of thyroid tissues was observed by H&E staining, and also the expression of thermo-regulating proteins was determined by Western blot in dorsal root ganglia and brain tissues of rats. Results : The administration of ALRP extract in PTU-induced hypothyroidism rats was significantly increased body temperature, but did not changes on body weight, food and water intake. ALRP extract did not effect on the levels of TSH and T4 in the hypothyroidism rats. ALRP extract significantly decreased the levels of GPT, glucose, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and total cholesterol in the hypothyroidism rats. In histological observation, the enlarged epithelium and atrophic follicles with higher concentration of follicular cells on hypothyroidism were improved by ALRP extract. In addition, ALRP extract increased the expression of TRPV1 and TRPM8 ion channel proteins in hypothyroidism rats. Conclusion : These results indicate that ALRP extract can improve PTU-induced hypothyroidism through regulation of body temperature and lipid accumulation. The action mechanism of ALRP extract is related with body temperature control by thermoregulation with TRP ion channels."

Twenty Hanwoo bulls (653 +/- 22.1) were randomly assigned by body weight (BW) to determine the effects of feeding zilpaterol hydrochloride (Ten bulls with 8.3 mg/kg ZH and ten bulls without ZH) on the ultrasound measurement, carcass traits, and serum compositions. Treatments comprised diets with and without ZH supplemented for 20 days prior to harvest with three days withdrawal period. Treatment of ZH led to an increase either in the final BW or average daily gain (ADG) in Hanwoo bulls (P<0.05). There was no treatment effect on the back fat thickness, ribeye area, and marbling score (P>0.05). ZH treatment tended to increase at dressing percentage (P=0.068). There was a high positive correlation (R-2=0.9226) at treatment but relatively low positive correlation (R-2=0.7156) at control between ultrasound longissimus muscle area and ribeye area. The treatment of ZH affects the serum triglyceride and non esterified fatty acid (P<0.05). Moreover, we demonstrated that the treatment of ZH did not have a negative effect on the serum level of GOT or GPT of Hanwoo bulls. We concluded that the treatment of ZH has little impact on the carcass trait of Hanwoo bulls regardless of the positive effect on BW and ADG. However, dietary ZH increased lipid related serum metabolites of Hanwoo bulls at 14th day.</P>"

가미한다열소탕(加味寒多熱少湯)이 고지방식이 비만생쥐의 체지방감소에 미치는 영향,2016,"['Gami-Handayeolso-Tang', 'HDYST', 'Obesity', 'High fat diet', 'Lipid accumulation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objectives In this study, it was investigated whether Gami-Handayeolso-Tang (HDYST) medication has anti-obesity effects in high fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice. Methods The experimental animals were divided into five groups-normal diet-fed (ND), high fat diet-fed control (HFD), HFD＋HDYST 150, HFD＋HDYST 300, and HFD＋orlistat as a positive drug. The obese markers such as body weight, diet efficiency ratio, serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, lipid contents, leptin, adiponectin, and GOT/GPT were measured. Also, white adipose tissue, liver weight, abdominal fat mass, hepatic lipid contents, and mRNA expression of obese-associating genes were examined in obese mice. Results In high fat diet-fed mice, HDYST administration significantly decreased body weight, diet efficiency ratio, serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, as well as leptin and GOT/GPT, compared to the HFD group in a dose-dependent manner. HDYST increased significantly the serum levels of HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin. It also reduced the accumulation of lipids, such as total lipid and triglycerides, in organs such as liver and abdominal adipose tissue. Moreover, HDYST administration significantly decreased the expression levels of fatty acid synthetic genes, such as sterol regulatory element- binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), FAS and Stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD-1), in the liver tissues, while it increased the messenger RAN (mRNA) levels of fatty acid catalytic genes, such as Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), acyl-COA oxidase (ACO), and Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a (CPT-1a). Conclusions Based on the results above, HDYST reveals anti-obesity effects declining body fat accumulation through the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and leptin/ adiponectin serum levels. It therefore suggests that HDYST can be clinically useful for the treatment of obesity. (J Korean Med Rehab 2016;26(1):13-31)"
자음강화탕(滋陰降火湯)이 호흡기 점액의 생성 및 분비에 미치는 영향,2016,"['Jaeumganghwa-tang (JGT)', 'Mucus secretion', 'Mucin', 'MUC5AC', 'NCI-H292 cells']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objectives In this study, the effects of Ja-eum-gang-hwa-tang (JGT) on the increase in airway epithelial mucosubstances of rats and ATP- or PMA- or EGF- or TNF-${\alpha}$-induced MUC5AC mucin production and gene expression from human airway epithelial cells were investigated. Materials and Methods Hypersecretion of airway mucus was produced by exposure of $SO_2$ to rats for 3 weeks. The effect of orally-administered JGT for 2 weeks on increased epithelial mucosubstances from tracheal goblet cells of rats was assessed by using histopathological analysis after staining the epithelial tissue with Hematoxylin-eosin and PAS-alcian blue. Possible cytotoxicity of JGT was assessed by investigating the potential damage on kidneys and liver functions by measuring serum GOT/GPT activities and serum BUN concentration of rats and the body weight gain during experiment. Also, the effect of JGT on ATP- or PMA- or EGF- or TNF-${\alpha}$-induced MUC5AC mucin production and gene expression from human airway epithelial cells (NCI-H292) were investigated. Confluent NCI-H292 cells were pretreated for 30 min in the presence of JGT and treated with ATP ($200{\mu}M$) or PMA ($10ng/ml$) or EGF ($25ng/ml$) or TNF-${\alpha}$ (0.2 nM) for 24 hrs to assess the effect of JGT both on ATP- or PMA- or EGF- or TNF-${\alpha}$-induced MUC5AC mucin production by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and on gene expression by the same inducers using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results (1) JGT decreased the amount of intraepithelial mucosubstances of trachea of rats. (2) JGT did not show any renal and hepatic toxicities, and did not affect body weights either. (3) JGT significantly inhibited ATP-, PMA-, EGF-, and TNF-${\alpha}$-induced MUC5AC mucin productions from NCI-H292 cells. (4) JGT inhibited EGF-, and PMA-induced expression levels of MUC5AC gene in NCI-H292 cells. However, ATP- and TNF-${\alpha}$-induced MUC5AC gene expression levels were not affected in NCI-H292 cells. Conclusions The result from the present study suggests that JGT might control the production and gene expression of airway mucin observed in various respiratory diseases which accompanied by mucus hypersecretion. Also, JGT did not show liver toxicity or impact on kidney functions. The effect of JGT should be further studied by using animal experimental models which can show proper pathophysiology of airway diseases."
