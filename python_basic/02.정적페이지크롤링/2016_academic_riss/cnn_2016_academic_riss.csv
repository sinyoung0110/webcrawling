Among the algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is known to be efficient for image processing tasks used for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems(ADAS). However, it is difficult to achieve real-time processing for CNN in vehicle embedded software environment due to the repeated operations contained in each layer of CNN. In this paper, we propose a hardware accelerator which enhances the execution time of CNN by parallelizing the repeated operations such as convolution. Xilinx ZC706 evaluation board is used to verify the performance of the proposed accelerator. For 36x36 input images, the hardware execution time of CNN is 2.812ms in 100MHz clock frequency and shows that our hardware can be executed in real-time."
CNN을 사용한 차선검출 시스템,2016,"['Lane detection', 'CNN', 'Machine learning', 'Image processing']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Lane detection is a widely researched topic. Although simple road detection is easily achieved by previous methods, lane detection becomes very difficult in several complex cases involving noisy edges. To address this, we use a Convolution neural network (CNN) for image enhancement. CNN is a deep learning method that has been very successfully applied in object detection and recognition. In this paper, we introduce a robust lane detection method based on a CNN combined with random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Initially, we calculate edges in an image using a hat shaped kernel, then we detect lanes using the CNN combined with the RANSAC. In the training process of the CNN, input data consists of edge images and target data is images that have real white color lanes on an otherwise black background. The CNN structure consists of 8 layers with 3 convolutional layers, 2 subsampling layers and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) of 3 fully-connected layers. Convolutional and subsampling layers are hierarchically arranged to form a deep structure. Our proposed lane detection algorithm successfully eliminates noise lines and was found to perform better than other formal line detection algorithms such as RANSAC"

Caltech 보행자 감지를위한 Scale-aware Faster R-CNN,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"We present real-time pedestrian detection that exploit accuracy of Faster R-CNN network. Faster R-CNN has shown to success at PASCAL VOC multi-object detection tasks, and their ability to operate on raw pixel input without the need to design special features is very engaging. Therefore, in this work we apply and adjust Faster R- CNN to single object detection, which is pedestrian detection. The drawback of Faster R-CNN is its failure when object size is small. Previously, small sized object problem was solved by Scale-aware Network. We incorporate Scale-aware Network to Faster R-CNN. This made our method Scale-aware Faster R-CNN (DF R-CNN) that is both fast and very accurate. We separated Faster R-CNN networks into two sub-network，that is one for large-size objects and another one for small-size objects. The resulting approach achieves a 28.3% average miss rate on the Caltech Pedestrian detection benchmark, which is competitive with the other best reported results."

This task was done manually by humans which is a waste of human resources. Current systems that are employed for automatic extraction of characters require a constant source of illumination, a certain pattern, and a fixed camera angle. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) promises a high recognition rate of 99% for optical character recognition and outputs stable results even in varying environmental conditions. Therefore, this paper implements CNN for the estimation of the character region. For color classification in industries, the color strongly depends on the concentration of the paint and the illumination conditions. The first problem is the misclassification of the chromatic color to another unique color and the neighboring hue of the chromatic color when the brightness and chroma are low in the RGB color space. This paper uses a feed forward neural network to solve the first issue of color classification. The color of an object is perceived by the ray of light that it reflects. When this light color changes, the color of the object looks different. This attributes to the second problem in which the perception of colors varies with the change in the illumination color of the light source. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes to implement CNN for the approximation of the color of the light source."

The learning CNN templates values are formulated as an optimization problem to achieve the desired performances which can be found by means of Adaptive Fuzzy (AF) algorithm and Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) algorithm techniques. The main objective of the paper is to compare the performances of standard CNN, Adaptive Fuzzy (AF), and Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) on real data of several vehicle license plate images of standard Indonesia License Plates. The results are then compared with ideal vehicle license plate images. Quantitative analysis between ideal vehicle license plate images and segmented vehicle license plate images is presented in terms of Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). From the performance analysis, the CNN template optimized by ANFIS algorithm is more recommended than the standard CNN edge detector or the CNN template optimized by Adaptive Fuzzy algorithm in vehicle license plate image segmentation. It is shown from the calculation that PSNR is 80% better than the standard CNN, and the resulted MSE and RMSE are 70% better than the standard CNN. Whereas the CNN template optimized by Adaptive Fuzzy algorithm achieves the PSNR 90% better than the standard CNN, but it yields the MSE and RMSE 40% worse than the standard CNN."
New Approach to Optimize the Size of Convolution Mask in Convolutional Neural Networks,2016,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'Convolution Mask', 'Convolution Layer']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Convolutional neural network (CNN) consists of a few pairs of both convolution layer and subsampling layer. Thus it has more hidden layers than multi-layer perceptron. With the increased layers, the size of convolution mask ultimately determines the total number of weights in CNN because the mask is shared among input images. It also is an important learning factor which makes or breaks CNN""s learning. Therefore, this paper proposes the best method to choose the convolution size and the number of layers for learning CNN successfully. Through our face recognition with vast learning examples, we found that the best size of convolution mask is 5 by 5 and 7 by 7, regardless of the number of layers. In addition, the CNN with two pairs of both convolution and subsampling layer is found to make the best performance as if the multi-layer perceptron having two hidden layers does."

Since there is no lead in QFN, there are many defects on solder. Therefore, we propose an efficient mechanism for QFN solder defect detection at this paper. For this, we employ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) of the Machine Learning algorithm. QFN solder’s color multi-layer images are used to train CNN. Since these images are 3-channel color images, they have a problem with applying to CNN. To solve this problem, we used each 1-channel grayscale image (Red, Green, Blue) that was separated from 3-channel color images. We were able to detect QFN solder defects by using this CNN. In this paper, it is shown that the CNN is superior to the conventional multi-layer neural networks in detecting QFN solder defects. Later, further research is needed to detect other QFN."

A method to detect high-resistance ground fault accidents by converting the fault current into visual data and applying the CNN technique to this is presented and verified. The data for learning the CNN technique was generated through simulation of the model system. Simulations were performed for data generation by changing the fault resistance, the size, location of faults and amount of distributed power generation, in the case of a high-resistance ground fault and an increase in load in the model system. The generated data was transformed into graphic data by applying Morlett wavelet transform, and then learning was performed by applying CNN. As a result of the learning, high-resistance ground faults were identified with 98.29% accuracy, and a protective algorithm including this result that can respond to high-resistance ground faults occurring in the distribution system was proposed."

Improving discrimination ability of convolutional neural networks by hybrid learning,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The discrimination of similar patterns is important because they are the major sources of the classification error. This paper proposes a novel method to improve the discrimination ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by hybrid learning. The proposed method embeds a collection of discriminators as well as a recognizer in a shared CNN. By visualizing contrastive class saliency, we show that learning with embedded discriminators leads the shared CNN to detect and catch the differences among similar classes. Also proposed is a hybrid learning algorithm that learns recognition and discrimination together. The proposed method learns recognition focusing on the differences among similar classes, and thereby improves the discrimination ability of the CNN. Unlike conventional discrimination methods, the proposed method does not require predefined sets of similar classes or additional step to integrate its result with that of the recognizer. In experiments on two handwritten Hangul databases SERI95a and PE92, the proposed method reduced classification error from 2.56 to 2.33, and from 4.04 to 3.66% respectively. These improvement lead to relative error reduction rates of 8.97% on SERI95a, and 9.42% on PE92. Our best results update the state-of-the-art performance which were 4.04% on SERI95a and 7.08% on PE92.</P>"

Once a training phase is done in CNN, the computation of each node can be expressed as a sum of multiplications with constant inputs (i.e., with known weights obtained from the training phase). Consequently, we can convert the multiplications into a sum of multiple addends, thereby producing an expression of sum of addends for the node computation, from which we generate a fast carry-save-adder (CSA) implementation structure for the expression. Through gate-level implementation of our proposed technique, we are able to reduce the node computation time by 8.8% on average while a little increase in power consumption, which is mainly caused by our prototyping of incompletely optimized CSA circuits in comparison with the commercial CSAs."

Machine Learning-Based Imaging System for Surface Defect Inspection,2016,"['Defect detection', 'Deep neural networks', 'Machine learning', 'Machine vision']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Modern inspection systems based on smart sensor technology like image processing and machine vision have been widely spread into several fields of industry such as process control, manufacturing, and robotics applications in factories. Machine learning for smart sensors is a key element for the visual inspection of parts on a product line that has been manually inspected by people. This paper proposes a method for automatic visual inspection of dirties, scratches, burrs, and wears on surface parts. Imaging analysis with CNN (Convolution Neural Network) of training samples is applied to confirm the defect's existence in the target region of an image. In this paper, we have built and tested several types of deep networks of different depths and layer nodes to select adequate structure for surface defect inspection. A single CNN based network is enough to test several types of defects on textured and non-textured surfaces while conventional machine learning methods are separately applied according to type of each surface. Experiments for surface defects in real images prove the possibility for use of imaging sensors for detection of different types of defects. In terms of energy saving, the experiment result shows that proposed method has several advantages in time and cost saving and shows higher performance than traditional manpower inspection system."
Deep CNNs Along the Time Axis With Intermap Pooling for Robustness to Spectral Variations,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional and pooling operations along the frequency axis have been proposed to attain invariance to frequency shifts of features. However, this is inappropriate with regard to the fact that acoustic features vary in frequency. In this paper, we contend that convolution along the time axis is more effective. We also propose the addition of an intermap pooling (IMP) layer to deep CNNs. In this layer, filters in each group extract common but spectrally variant features, then the layer pools the feature maps of each group. As a result, the proposed IMP CNN can achieve insensitivity to spectral variations characteristic of different speakers and utterances. The effectiveness of the IMP CNN architecture is demonstrated on several LVCSR tasks. Even without speaker adaptation techniques, the architecture achieved a WER of 12.7% on the SWB part of the Hub5’2000 evaluation test set, which is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.</P>"
Software Module Fault Prediction using Convolutional Neural Network with Feature Selection,2016,"['Software Faults', 'Software Fault Prediction', 'Feature Selection', 'Convolutional Neural Network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Software plays a significant role in technological and economic development due to its utmost importance in day to day activities. A sequence of rigorous activities under certain constraints is followed to come up with reliable software. Various measures are taken during the process of software development to ensure high quality software. One such method is software module fault prediction for quality assurance to discover defects in the software prior to testing. It aids in predicting the software module faults earlier in the development of the software which predicts fault prone modules so that these can be given special attention to avoid any future risk which eventually curbs the testing along with maintenance cost and effort. The literature survey uncovers many findings that had never been focused like dimensionality reduction and feature selection based on individual feature importance which leads to increase in time complexity and chances of false information. This paper addresses these issues and proposes a supervised machine learning based software module fault prediction technique by implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as classifier model. Feature selection methods used are InfoGain and Correlation. The results obtained are compared with the existing method HySOM (SOM Clustering with Artificial Neural Network Classification) by considering three different feature sets (Fifteen features, Eighteen features and Twenty one features) of PC1 dataset from NASA. The comparative analysis is performed on the basis of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-measure. The results clearly show better performance of the proposed CNN based technique than HySOM. This paper will contribute towards improvement of quality assurance models utilized for software fault prediction by automating this process using machine learning which enhances True Positive Rate and reduces the detection error. This in turn will help project managers, testers and developers to locate and keep track of fault prone modules so that final software is more accurate, consistent and reliable without consuming much of the testing and maintenance resources."

It was first aired on April 11, 2010 and concluded on December 29, 2013 in the US, comprising 4 seasons and 36 episodes. Pst-Katrina New Orleans has been a controversial example in recent academic discussions on biopolitics, neoliberalism, and the state of exception. In representing the flooded New Orleans, the mainstream media, such as The New York Times and CNN, revealed the inherent racism in American society. The state declared a state of emergency in the state of Louisiana. Instead of immediate humanitarian relief, the military mounted a massive response to the poor and troubled citizens in the shocked city. As a result, the city turned into a present example of Giorgio Agamben’s state of exception. The people who lived in the most damaged areas were mainly poor, low-income working class African-Americans. They are the disposable people, or what Zygmunt Bauman names the human waste in the age of neoliberalism. Hurricane Katrina was a second chance for the local politicians and the business elite of the city. In contrast to their neoliberal reconstruction of the city, Treme foregrounds the autonomous practices of ordinary people’s efforts to recover what they lost. Here the city’s unique culture matters most. Treme portrays various characters’ struggles and lives after the storm. This paper explores how their culturally driven lifestyles can be an example of Hardt and Negri’s biopolitical production, which aims to create a new form of life. This paper concludes that what Treme eventually projects to us is a vision for a form of life, which diverges from the dominant neoliberal lifestyle and subjectivity."
