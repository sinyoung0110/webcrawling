워드 임베딩과 품사 태깅을 이용한 클래스 언어모델 연구,2016,"['워드 임베딩', '클래스 언어모델', '품사부착 기반 언어모델', 'RNN LM', 'word embedding', 'class LM', 'part-of-speech tagging based class LM']","음성인식 성능 개선을 위한 언어모델의 기술적 진보는 최근 심층 신경망을 기반으로 한 접근방법으로 한 단계 더 진보한 모양새다. 그러나 연구되고 있는 심층 신경망 기반 언어모델은 대부분 음성인식 이후 리스코링 단계에서 적용할 수 있는 한계를 지닌다. 또한 대규모 어휘에 대한 심층 신경망 접근방법은 아직 시간이 필요하다고 본다. 따라서 본 논문은 심층 신경망 언어 모델의 단순화된 형태인 워드임베딩 기술을 음성인식 후처리가 아닌 기반 N-gram모델에 바로 적용할 수 있는 접근 방법을 찾는다. 클래스 언어모델이 한 접근 방법이 될 수 있는데, 본 연구에서는 워드 임베딩을 우선 구축하고, 해당 어휘별 벡터 정보를 클러스터링하여 클래스 언어모델을 구축 방법을 제시한다. 이를 기존 어휘기반 N-gram 모델에 통합한 후, 언어모델의 성능 개선 여부를 확인한다. 클래스 언어모델의 타당성 검증을 위해 다양한 클래스 개수의 언어모델 실험과 RNN LM과의 비교 결과를 검토한 후, 모든 언어모델의 성능 개선을 보장하는 품사 부착 언어모델 생성 방법을 제안한다.","Recurrent neural network based language models (RNN LM) have shown improved results in language model researches. The RNN LMs are limited to post processing sessions, such as the N-best rescoring step of the wFST based speech recognition. However, it has considerable vocabulary problems that require large computing powers for the LM training. In this paper, we try to find the 1st pass N-gram model using word embedding, which is the simplified deep neural network. The class based language model (LM) can be a way to approach to this issue. We have built class based vocabulary through word embedding, by combining the class LM with word N-gram LM to evaluate the performance of LMs. In addition, we propose that part-of-speech (POS) tagging based LM shows an improvement of perplexity in all types of the LM tests."
장소 정보를 학습한 딥하이퍼넷 기반 TV드라마 소셜 네트워크 분석,2016,"['소셜 네트워크 분석', '친밀도 분석', '멀티모달 개념 학습', '딥하이퍼넷', '딥러닝', 'social network analysis', 'affinity analysis', 'multimodal concept learning', 'deep hypernetwork', 'deep learning']","Social-aware video는 자유로운 스토리 전개를 통해 인물들간의 관계뿐만 아니라 경제, 정치, 문화 등 다양한 지식을 사람에게 전달해주고 있다. 특히 장소에 따른 사람들간의 대화 습성과 행동 패턴은 사회관계를 분석하는데 있어서 아주 중요한 정보이다. 하지만 멀티모달과 동적인 특성으로 인해 컴퓨터가 비디오로부터 자동으로 지식을 습득하기에는 아직 많은 어려움이 있다. 이러한 문제점들을 해결하기 위해 기존의 연구에서는 딥하이퍼넷 모델을 사용하여 드라마 등장인물의 시각과 언어 정보를 기반으로 계층적 구조를 사용해 소셜 네트워크를 분석하였다. 하지만 장소 정보를 사용하지 않아 전반적인 스토리로부터 소셜 네트워크를 분석할 수밖에 없었다. 본 논문에서는 기존 연구를 바탕으로 장소 정보를 추가하여 각 장소에서의 인물 특성을 분석해 보았다. 본 논문에서는 총 4400분 분량의 TV드라마 “Friends”를 사용했고 C-RNN모델을 통해 등장인물을 인식하였으며 Bag of Features로 장소를 분류하였다. 그리고 딥하이퍼넷 모델을 통해 자동으로 소셜 네트워크를 생성하였고 각 장소에서의 인물 관계 변화를 분석하였다.","Social-aware video displays not only the relationships between characters but also diverse information on topics such as economics, politics and culture as a story unfolds. Particularly, the speaking habits and behavioral patterns of people in different situations are very important for the analysis of social relationships. However, when dealing with this dynamic multi-modal data, it is difficult for a computer to analyze the drama data effectively. To solve this problem, previous studies employed the deep concept hierarchy (DCH) model to automatically construct and analyze social networks in a TV drama. Nevertheless, since location knowledge was not included, they can only analyze the social network as a whole in stories. In this research, we include location knowledge and analyze the social relations in different locations. We adopt data from approximately 4400 minutes of a TV drama Friends as our dataset. We process face recognition on the characters by using a convolutional- recursive neural networks model and utilize a bag of features model to classify scenes. Then, in different scenes, we establish the social network between the characters by using a deep concept hierarchy model and analyze the change in the social network while the stories unfold."
딥러닝의 모형과 응용사례,2016,"['딥러닝', '합성곱신경망', '순환신경망', '오류역전파 알고리즘', 'Deep learning', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'Error backpropagation algorithm']",,"Deep learning model is a kind of neural networks that allows multiple hidden layers. There are various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks. Those have been applied to fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition and bioinformatics where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks. Among those architectures, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are classified as the supervised learning model. And in recent years, those supervised learning models have gained more popularity than unsupervised learning models such as deep belief networks, because supervised learning models have shown fashionable applications in such fields mentioned above.  Deep learning models can be trained with backpropagation algorithm. Backpropagation is an abbreviation for “backward propagation of errors” and a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent. The method calculates the gradient of an error function with respect to all the weights in the network. The gradient is fed to the optimization method which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the error function.  Convolutional neural networks use a special architecture which is particularly well-adapted to classify images. Using this architecture makes convolutional networks fast to train. This, in turn, helps us train deep, muti-layer networks, which are very good at classifying images. These days, deep convolutional networks are used in most neural networks for image recognition. Convolutional neural networks use three basic ideas: local receptive fields, shared weights, and pooling. By local receptive fields, we mean that each neuron in the first(or any) hidden layer will be connected to a small region of the input(or previous layer’s) neurons. Shared weights mean that we’re going to use the same weights and bias for each of the local receptive field. This means that all the neurons in the hidden layer detect exactly the same feature, just at different locations in the input image. In addition to the convolutional layers just described, convolutional neural networks also contain pooling layers. Pooling layers are usually used immediately after convolutional layers. What the pooling layers do is to simplify the information in the output from the convolutional layer. Recent convolutional network architectures have 10 to 20 hidden layers and billions of connections between units. Training deep learning networks has taken weeks several years ago, but thanks to progress in GPU and algorithm enhancement, training time has reduced to several hours.  Neural networks with time-varying behavior are known as recurrent neural networks or RNNs. A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. Early RNN models turned out to be very difficult to train, harder even than deep feedforward networks. The reason is the unstable gradient problem such as vanishing gradient and exploding gradient. The gradient can get smaller and smaller as it is propagated back through layers. This makes learning in early layers extremely slow. The problem actually gets worse in RNNs, since gradients aren’t just propagated backward through layers, they’re propagated backward through time. If the network runs for a long time, that can make the gradient extremely unstable and hard to learn from. It has been possible to incorporate an idea known as long short-term memory units (LSTMs) into RNNs. LSTMs make it much easier to get good results when traini"
