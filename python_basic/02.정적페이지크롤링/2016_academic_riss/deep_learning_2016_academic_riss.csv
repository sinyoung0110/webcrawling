Security Detection of Building Structure Based on Sparse Encoding Deep Learning Algorithm,2016,"['Structure security', 'Deep learning', 'Sparse encoding', 'Wireless sensor', 'Bridge structure']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Most health problems of building structures are accumulative damages which are difficult to detect, and it is more difficult to monitor the structure health due to the complexity of the practical structure and the environment noise, and the existing methods need lots of data for model training but it is very complicated to mark the data in practice. In order to solve above problems, the wireless sensor network is configured and the sparse encoding method is adopted to monitor the bridge structure health, and meanwhile the sparse encoding algorithm is adopted for training on the basis of the characteristic extraction of many unlabeled instances, thus to compress data dimensionality and preprocess unlabeled data. Then, the deep learning algorithm is adopted to predict the bridge structure health monitoring type, and meanwhile Hessian optimization is improved on the basis of the linear conjugate gradient in order to replace uncertain Hessian matrix by positive semidefinite Gaussian - Newton curvature matrix for secondary objective combination, thus to improve the efficiency of the deep learning algorithm.

To enhance the recognition ratio of the proposed voice recognizer, ambient noise mixed into the voice signal has to be eliminated.

In this paper, a filter has been designed for the frequency range within a voice signal, and imposed weights are used to reduce data deterioration. In addition, a deep learning algorithm, which does not require a database in the recognition algorithm, has been adapted for embedded systems, which inherently require small amounts of memory. The experimental results suggest that the proposed deep learning algorithm and HMM voice recognizer, utilizing the proposed adaptive MFCC algorithm, perform better than conventional MFCC algorithms in its recognition ratio within a noisy environment."

State-space model with deep learning for functional dynamics estimation in resting-state fMRI,2016,"['Dynamic functional connectivity', 'Deep learning', 'Hidden Markov model', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Studies on resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) have shown that different brain regions still actively interact with each other while a subject is at rest, and such functional interaction is not stationary but changes over time. In terms of a large-scale brain network, in this paper, we focus on time-varying patterns of functional networks, i.e., functional dynamics, inherent in rs-fMRI, which is one of the emerging issues along with the network modelling. Specifically, we propose a novel methodological architecture that combines deep learning and state-space modelling, and apply it to rs-fMRI based Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) diagnosis. We first devise a Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE) to discover hierarchical non-linear functional relations among regions, by which we transform the regional features into an embedding space, whose bases are complex functional networks. Given the embedded functional features, we then use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to estimate dynamic characteristics of functional networks inherent in rs-fMRI via internal states, which are unobservable but can be inferred from observations statistically. By building a generative model with an HMM, we estimate the likelihood of the input features of rs-fMRI as belonging to the corresponding status, i.e., MCI or normal healthy control, based on which we identify the clinical label of a testing subject. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on two different datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods in the literature. We also analyzed the functional networks learned by DAE, estimated the functional connectivities by decoding hidden states in HMM, and investigated the estimated functional connectivities by means of a graph-theoretic approach."

Deformable MR Prostate Segmentation via Deep Feature Learning and Sparse Patch Matching,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Automatic and reliable segmentation of the prostate is an important but difficult task for various clinical applications such as prostate cancer radiotherapy. The main challenges for accurate MR prostate localization lie in two aspects: (1) inhomogeneous and inconsistent appearance around prostate boundary, and (2) the large shape variation across different patients. To tackle these two problems, we propose a new deformable MR prostate segmentation method by unifying deep feature learning with the sparse patch matching. First, instead of directly using handcrafted features, we propose to learn the latent feature representation from prostate MR images by the stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE). Since the deep learning algorithm learns the feature hierarchy from the data, the learned features are often more concise and effective than the handcrafted features in describing the underlying data. To improve the discriminability of learned features, we further refine the feature representation in a supervised fashion. Second, based on the learned features, a sparse patch matching method is proposed to infer a prostate likelihood map by transferring the prostate labels from multiple atlases to the new prostate MR image. Finally, a deformable segmentation is used to integrate a sparse shape model with the prostate likelihood map for achieving the final segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the dataset that contains 66 T2-wighted prostate MR images. Experimental results show that the deep-learned features are more effective than the handcrafted features in guiding MR prostate segmentation. Moreover, our method shows superior performance than other state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Index Terms-Deformable</P>"
Scalable High-Performance Image Registration Framework by Unsupervised Deep Feature Representations Learning,2016,"['Deep learning', 'deformable image registration', 'hierarchical feature representation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Feature selection is a critical step in deformable image registration. In particular, selecting the most discriminative features that accurately and concisely describe complex morphological patterns in image patches improves correspondence detection, which in turn improves image registration accuracy. Furthermore, since more and more imaging modalities are being invented to better identify morphological changes in medical imaging data, the development of deformable image registration method that scales well to new image modalities or new image applications with little to no human intervention would have a significant impact on the medical image analysis community. To address these concerns, a learning-based image registration framework is proposed that uses deep learning to discover compact and highly discriminative features upon observed imaging data. Specifically, the proposed feature selection method uses a convolutional stacked autoencoder to identify intrinsic deep feature representations in image patches. Since deep learning is an unsupervised learning method, no ground truth label knowledge is required. This makes the proposed feature selection method more flexible to new imaging modalities since feature representations can be directly learned from the observed imaging data in a very short amount of time. Using the LONI and ADNI imaging datasets, image registration performance was compared to two existing state-of-the-art deformable image registration methods that use handcrafted features. To demonstrate the scalability of the proposed image registration framework, image registration experiments were conducted on 7.0-T brain MR images. In all experiments, the results showed that the new image registration framework consistently demonstrated more accurate registration results when compared to state of the art.</P>"
Deep sparse multi-task learning for feature selection in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Recently, neuroimaging-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis has attracted researchers in the field, due to the increasing prevalence of the diseases. Unfortunately, the unfavorable high-dimensional nature of neuroimaging data, but a limited small number of samples available, makes it challenging to build a robust computer-aided diagnosis system. Machine learning techniques have been considered as a useful tool in this respect and, among various methods, sparse regression has shown its validity in the literature. However, to our best knowledge, the existing sparse regression methods mostly try to select features based on the optimal regression coefficients in one step. We argue that since the training feature vectors are composed of both informative and uninformative or less informative features, the resulting optimal regression coefficients are inevidently affected by the uninformative or less informative features. To this end, we first propose a novel deep architecture to recursively discard uninformative features by performing sparse multi-task learning in a hierarchical fashion. We further hypothesize that the optimal regression coefficients reflect the relative importance of features in representing the target response variables. In this regard, we use the optimal regression coefficients learned in one hierarchy as feature weighting factors in the following hierarchy, and formulate a weighted sparse multi-task learning method. Lastly, we also take into account the distributional characteristics of samples per class and use clustering-induced subclass label vectors as target response values in our sparse regression model. In our experiments on the ADNI cohort, we performed both binary and multi-class classification tasks in AD/MCI diagnosis and showed the superiority of the proposed method by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.</P>"

Toward a deeper level of learning in sport and leisure studies: Supporting students in becoming self-regulated and transformative learners,2016,"['Deep learning', 'self-regulated learner', 'transformative learner']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: Students in the field of sport and leisure are active and responsible participants in their own learning. In order to reach a deeper level of learning, students must be fully engaged in their own learning and its outcomes. Self-regulated leaners (i.e., students who are autonomous in their learning) tend to integrate their self-generated thoughts, feelings, and behaviors into their own academic skills. Transformative learners (i.e., reflexive students who are continuously reflecting on and being critical of their own learning) tend to care about their future “becoming” (e.g., being an ethical practitioner in the field of sport and leisure) and “living” (e.g., pursuing ethical professional practices in sport and leisure contexts). Inspiring students, and then helping them translate that passion into proficiency in various subject areas in the field of sport and leisure, are thus keys to the success in post-secondary education. This study aimed at exploring various ways of promoting self-regulated and transformative learning among sport and leisure post-secondary students. Method: Action learning (i.e., an inquiry approach focusing on “bringing people together to learn from each other’s experiences”; Kemmis & McTaggart, 2005, p. 561) and narrative inquiry (i.e., a study of experience aimed at enriching and transforming experiences by writing, sharing, and collaboratively reflecting on stories of one’s lived experience; Clandinin & Connelly, 2000) were utilized. Result: Critical moments, reflexive insights, and transformed practices were captured thorough narrative writings and will be shared during presentation. Examples of engaging in problem solving (e.g., case study approaches to real-world situations), problem posing (e.g., critical writing assignments on controversial issues in current professional practices), and scaffolding approaches (e.g., opportunities for students to share or link their daily experiences to course content) will also be showcased to highlight various practical strategies to support students in becoming self-regulated and transformative learners. Conclusion: This presentation would offer audiences a vicarious experience in which their experiential background is enlarged to engage in various pedagogic approaches that promote self-regulated and transformative learning in their own academic programs."

The deep learning algorithm can largely increase the accuracy of classification whereas cut down the processing time consumed, we adopt the deep neural network and support vector machine to extract image features both in RGB and YUV color spaces. Boundary detection in sudden change, by contrast, is more global in nature, such as texture, so need to integrate the whole information of the image. Under the guidance, we modify the current segmentation methods with boundary detection technique to serve as the pre-processing step before classifying colors. Experimental results on synthetic and real images show that the new algorithm is effective and efficient, and is relatively independent of this type of noise. Further analysis is also conducted in the final section."
Unsupervised feature learning for classification,2016,"['CNN', 'Unsupervised learning', 'zoom-out dataset']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In computer vision especially in image processing, it has become popular to apply deep convolutional networks for supervised learning. Convolutional networks have shown a state of the art results in classification, object recognition, detection as well as semantic segmentation. However, supervised learning has two major disadvantages. One is it requires huge amount of labeled data to get high accuracy, the second one is to train so much data takes quite a bit long time. On the other hand, unsupervised learning can handle these problems more cheaper way. In this paper we show efficient way to learn features for classification in an unsupervised way. The network trained layer-wise, used backpropagation and our network learns features from unlabeled data. Our approach shows better results on Caltech-256 and STL-10 dataset."
Machine Learning-Based Imaging System for Surface Defect Inspection,2016,"['Defect detection', 'Deep neural networks', 'Machine learning', 'Machine vision']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Modern inspection systems based on smart sensor technology like image processing and machine vision have been widely spread into several fields of industry such as process control, manufacturing, and robotics applications in factories. Machine learning for smart sensors is a key element for the visual inspection of parts on a product line that has been manually inspected by people. This paper proposes a method for automatic visual inspection of dirties, scratches, burrs, and wears on surface parts. Imaging analysis with CNN (Convolution Neural Network) of training samples is applied to confirm the defect's existence in the target region of an image. In this paper, we have built and tested several types of deep networks of different depths and layer nodes to select adequate structure for surface defect inspection. A single CNN based network is enough to test several types of defects on textured and non-textured surfaces while conventional machine learning methods are separately applied according to type of each surface. Experiments for surface defects in real images prove the possibility for use of imaging sensors for detection of different types of defects. In terms of energy saving, the experiment result shows that proposed method has several advantages in time and cost saving and shows higher performance than traditional manpower inspection system."

Machine Learning Approaches to Corn Yield Estimation Using Satellite Images and Climate Data: A Case of Iowa State,2016,"['Crop Yield', 'Machine Learning', 'Remote Sensing', 'Climate Data']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Remote sensing data has been widely used in the estimation of crop yields by employing statistical methods such as regression model. Machine learning, which is an efficient empirical method for classification and prediction, is another approach to crop yield estimation. This paper described the corn yield estimation in Iowa State using four machine learning approaches such as SVM (Support Vector Machine), RF (Random Forest), ERT (Extremely Randomized Trees) and DL (Deep Learning). Also, comparisons of the validation statistics among them were presented. To examine the seasonal sensitivities of the corn yields, three period groups were set up: (1) MJJAS (May to September), (2) JA (July and August) and (3) OC (optimal combination of month). In overall, the DL method showed the highest accuracies in terms of the correlation coefficient for the three period groups. The accuracies were relatively favorable in the OC group, which indicates the optimal combination of month can be significant in statistical modeling of crop yields. The differences between our predictions and USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) statistics were about 6-8 %, which shows the machine learning approaches can be a viable option for crop yield modeling. In particular, the DL showed more stable results by overcoming the overfitting problem of generic machine learning methods."
Extracting Attributes of Named Entity from Unstructured Text with Deep Belief Network,2016,"['information extraction', 'entity attribute extraction', 'DBN']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Entity attribute extraction is a challenging research topic with broad application prospects.

Deep neural network with weight sparsity control and pre-training extracts hierarchical features and enhances classification performance: Evidence from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of schizophrenia,2016,"['Deep learning', 'Functional connectivity', 'Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sparsity', 'Stacked autoencoder']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Functional connectivity (FC) patterns obtained from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data are commonly employed to study neuropsychiatric conditions by using pattern classifiers such as the support vector machine (SVM). Meanwhile, a deep neural network (DNN) with multiple hidden layers has shown its ability to systematically extract lower-to-higher level information of image and speech data from lower-to-higher hidden layers, markedly enhancing classification accuracy. The objective of this study was to adopt the DNN for whole-brain resting-state FC pattern classification of schizophrenia (SZ) patients vs. healthy controls (HCs) and identification of aberrant FC patterns associated with SZ. We hypothesized that the lower-to-higher level features learned via the DNN would significantly enhance the classification accuracy, and proposed an adaptive learning algorithm to explicitly control the weight sparsity in each hidden layer via L<SUB>1</SUB>-norm regularization. Furthermore, the weights were initialized via stacked autoencoder based pre-training to further improve the classification performance. Classification accuracy was systematically evaluated as a function of (1) the number of hidden layers/nodes, (2) the use of L<SUB>1</SUB>-norm regularization, (3) the use of the pre-training, (4) the use of framewise displacement (FD) removal, and (5) the use of anatomical/functional parcellation. Using FC patterns from anatomically parcellated regions without FD removal, an error rate of 14.2% was achieved by employing three hidden layers and 50 hidden nodes with both L<SUB>1</SUB>-norm regularization and pre-training, which was substantially lower than the error rate from the SVM (22.3%). Moreover, the trained DNN weights (i.e., the learned features) were found to represent the hierarchical organization of aberrant FC patterns in SZ compared with HC. Specifically, pairs of nodes extracted from the lower hidden layer represented sparse FC patterns implicated in SZ, which was quantified by using kurtosis/modularity measures and features from the higher hidden layer showed holistic/global FC patterns differentiating SZ from HC. Our proposed schemes and reported findings attained by using the DNN classifier and whole-brain FC data suggest that such approaches show improved ability to learn hidden patterns in brain imaging data, which may be useful for developing diagnostic tools for SZ and other neuropsychiatric disorders and identifying associated aberrant FC patterns."
Unsupervised Feature Learning Assisted Visual Sentiment Analysis,2016,"['visual sentiment', 'deep learning', 'unsupervised feature learning', 'sparse autoencoder', 'convolutional neural network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Visual sentiment analysis which aims to understand the emotion and sentiment in visual content has attracted more and more attention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for visual sentiment concept classification with an unsupervised feature learning architecture called convolutional autoencoder. We first extract a representative set of unlabeled patches from the image dataset and discover useful features of these patches with sparse autoencoders. Then we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to obtain feature activations on full images for sentiment concept classification. We also fine-tune the network with a progressive strategy in order to filter out noisy samples in the weakly labeled training data. Meanwhile, we use low-level visual features to classify visual sentiment concepts in a traditional manner. At last the classification results with unsupervised feature learning and that with traditional features are taken into account together with a fusion algorithm to make a final prediction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets reveal that the proposed approach can achieve better performance in visual sentiment analysis compared to its predecessors."

A Sense Embedding of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Classification,2016,"['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Classification', 'Sense Sensitive', 'Word Embedding']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Sentiment classification task has attracted considerable interest as sentiment information is crucial for many natural language processing (NLP) applications. The goal of sentiment classification is to predict the overall emotional polarity of a given text. Previous work has demonstrate the remarkable performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, nearly all this work assumes a single word embedding for each word type, ignoring polysemy and thus inevitably casting negative impact on the downstream tasks. We extend the Skip-gram model to learn multiple sense embeddings for the word types, catering to introduce sense-based embeddings for CNN during sentiment classification. Instead of using the pipeline method to learn multiple sense embeddings of a word type, the sense discrimination and sense embedding learning for each word type are performed jointly based upon the semantics of its contextual words. We validate the effectiveness of the method on the commonly used datasets. Experiment results show that our method are able to improve the quality of sentiment classification when comparing with several competitive baselines."

Improved spatial accuracy of functional maps in the rat olfactory bulb using supervised machine learning approach,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Functional MRI (fMRI) is a popular and important tool for noninvasive mapping of neural activity. As fMRI measures the hemodynamic response, the resulting activation maps do not perfectly reflect the underlying neural activity. The purpose of this work was to design a data-driven model to improve the spatial accuracy of fMRI maps in the rat olfactory bulb. This system is an ideal choice for this investigation since the bulb circuit is well characterized, allowing for an accurate definition of activity patterns in order to train the model. We generated models for both cerebral blood volume weighted (CBVw) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI data. The results indicate that the spatial accuracy of the activation maps is either significantly improved or at worst not significantly different when using the learned models compared to a conventional general linear model approach, particularly for BOLD images and activity patterns involving deep layers of the bulb. Furthermore, the activation maps computed by CBVw and BOLD data show increased agreement when using the learned models, lending more confidence to their accuracy. The models presented here could have an immediate impact on studies of the olfactory bulb, but perhaps more importantly, demonstrate the potential for similar flexible, data-driven models to improve the quality of activation maps calculated using fMRI data.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  We applied machine learning to compute activation maps in the rat olfactory bulb. </LI> <LI>  Results from learned models were compared to results from general linear models. </LI> <LI>  Spatial accuracy of activation maps was significantly improved with learned models. </LI> <LI>  CBV and BOLD activation maps showed increased agreement using learned models. </LI> </UL> </P>"

We utilize data envelope analysis(DEA) and Malmquist analysis on the firms unit data during 2015-2020 to examine static and dynamic aspects of productivity. We also further analyzed the determinants of the Malmquist index by using panel regression, which means changes in productivity, and the results are as follows. First, data envelope analysis shows an average efficiency of 0.2 levels. Efficient companies and companies that achieved scale efficiency appeared at the 5% and 10%, respectively. Second, Malmquist Index is 1.001, which means that the productivity improvement is 0.1% per year. The reason is because of low-production efficiency despite technological innovation. Third, factors such as newer firms, smaller firms and R&D investment help to improve productivity according to the determinants of the Malmquist Index. On the other hand, the cost burden such as the purchase of raw materials and financial expenditure adversely affects the improvement.

Next is to learn academical structures of history in which learning subskills in the sub-area of historical thinking is an important task. Finally, adaptive expertise referring to deep understanding and transition that brain-based learning emphasizes can be achieved in the project approach or problem-solving learning approach only.Even though brain-based learning is a good teaching approach, actualizing it into the history classroom totally depends on teacher's expertise. Teachers should know about their learners as well as understand subject contents and academical structures of history. Particularly, this approach can be actualized based on teachers' research method knowledge and deep understanding of historical epistemology. That is the reason why brain-based learning emphasizes teacher's expertise."

Yet there are terror attacks, religious disputes and other conflicts continuously taking place on larger and larger scales as well as expanding further and further throughout the world. Interreligious harmony seems like a distant ideal. What is the ultimate cause of religious conflicts? Is interreligious communication truly that difficult? Even among different cultures, said cultures' varieties of ritual expressions, and various religious doctrines, there are points of general common to be appreciated if a deep perspective is adopted. When we find the common ground and understand each other's difference, it will be easier to communicate since everyone will be learning from each other. What could serve as common ground for different religions? Many scholars speak about the state of ‘oneness’ that is claimed by mysticism throughout a large array of religions. This state of oneness is typically not achieved overnight, but it serves as a prospective state which is pluralistically inclusive. This ""religion of enlightenment"" emphasizes the process of reaching comprehensive interreligious agreement would be characterized by a deep religious perspective. If superficial religious perspectives focuses only on faith to attain blessings and engage in blind belief, then, by contrast, deep religious perspectives emphasize inner divinity, the true self, orthe higher self.The words, ‘superficial religious perspective’ and ‘deep religious perspective’ were defined for personal convenience by O Gang-nam, a scholar of comparative religion. Consequently, this classification is a relative binary concept lacking hard and fast rules with regards to distinctions. But the concept of superficial religious perspectives and deep religious perspectives has its advantage in allowing clearer and easier discussion about religions because it could embrace all aspects of religious life and the development of various religious sentiment. In this way, the terms surface religious perspectives and deep religious perspectives will be used in limited framework. I both borrow this concept and reconsider it by referring to other scholars' methods of classification. From that point, I explore and these views in relation to religious experience.How does religiosity develop, maturity of religious faith take place, deep awareness of truth reveal itself, or an attitude of open-mindedness arise? After these states are realized, is interreligious agreement possible? Most religious studies scholars point out ‘religious experience.’ They say people could develop their faith from superficial religious beliefs into a more mature and deeper faith through religious experience while continuously aspiring towards enlightenment and practicing their religion in daily life.This study will try to examine aspects of superficial religious perspectives and deep religious perspectives represented in each religion and also explore criticism of each religion. With this view of superficial religious perspectives and deep religious perspectives, some cases documenting the religious experience of Daesoonjinrihoe disciples will be analyzed to see how their religiosity develops from superficial religious perspectives into deep religious perspectives through certain religious experiences. The characteristics of those experiences will also be investigated."

After data collection, descriptive statistic analysis, correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis, hierarchical regression analysis, and bootstrapping were conducted. However communication self-efficacy and in-degree centrality were excluded from the multiple regression analysis, mediating effects analysis, and bootstrapping because they have no significant correlation with the other variables. The results showed that surface strategy use negatively predicted out-degree centrality and deep strategy use and out-degree centrality significantly predicted perceived learning achievement. Out-degree centrality partially mediated the relationship between deep strategy use and perceived learning achievement, and fully mediated the relationship between surface strategy use and perceived learning achievement. Therefore, in online discussion, learners should make good use of deep strategy but also should be encouraged to avoid surface strategy use.

In the past, Philosophy, the flower of all studies, was relegated to the status of feudal lord while related fields such as aesthetics, ethics, religious study, etc. were distributed as the fiefs.Philosophy has also entereda crisis period similar to the modern decline of the humanities at universities . However, the crisis facing philosophy can be seen as an opportunity depending on the mindset. Then, how can the realm of philosophy, which distributed its territory to related studies, become territorialized again? The answer may lie in the restoration of desperateness as a way to rekindle the love of wisdom by starting with the fundamental ideas of philosophy. The same is true for Buddhist philosophy as part of philosophy. We should restore and promote the desperate attitudes of Beomcheon (梵天) who strived to gain insight into Jungdohaeng (中道行 Middle Way) and Yeongibeop (緣起法 law of causality) after the Buddha hesitated to preach following his enlightenment.For that, the precondition is the constant pursuit and learning topography and methodologies of Buddhist philosophy as part of philosophy. We need to ask and learn about Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy with a renewed mind by sticking to the globally adopted principle of 5W1H (who, what, where, when, why, how), on the basis of general philosophy classified largely into Western philosophy, Indian philosophy, and Chinese philosophy. Then, we will be able to discuss and 철학으로서 불교철학의 지형과 방법 / 고영섭 119 communicate more effectively through extensive inquiry about subject theory corresponding to existentialism of Western philosophy which is regarded as the universal language of Korea’s information-based society, theory of human nature corresponding to epistemology, and discipline theory corresponding to the theory of value.By doing so, we can reexamine the foundation of Buddhism and contemplate the roots of Buddhist philosophy. As Bunghwang Wonhyo (617~686) suggested, learning is the mission and duty of the person who is learning. Those who pursue learning, the abstruse meaning of scriptures containing the profound thoughts of Tathagata, should open the scripture and explore the meaning of Tripitaka with intense vigor. To explore the meaning of this literature, i.e., Tripitaka, we should develop a profound understanding of literary methodologies and apply a broad hermeneutical approach to understanding the true meaning of the literature. Learning is the mission and duty of the person pursuing the Tao. The person pursuing the Tao seeks to return to the foundation of single-mindedness after passing through various mental boundaries and obstacles. To pass through these various boundaries, self-reflection is a prerequisite.Self-reflection is based on the profound understanding of literature, which is based on learning and the broad interpretation of literature. Thus, there should be no pursuit of Tao without the pursuit of learning.As learning is the constant process of inquiry and acquiring knowledge, we can learn extensively by asking questions in detail. Those who pursue Tao are philosophers. If philosophy is the pursuit of learning, then philosophy represents the pursuit of Tao. Tao is the way of those living and enjoying by this way. As philosophy is the love of wisdom and learning is the process of asking and learning, we should pursue learning to follow the true path of Tao. We can climb to the path of Tao with deep insight into Application Study and Practical Study only when we become followers of the Tao who are well acquainted with literature and hermeneutics.

In addition, surface-acting showed a statistically significant positive correlation with learning goal orientation and performance goal orientation, and a statistically significant negative correlation with social support. The job satisfaction had a  statistically significant positive correlation with deep-acting, social support, learning goal orientation, and performance goal orientation. 3. A gradual stepwise multiple regression was conducted to identify the factors that affect job satisfaction, and it was found that job satisfaction point was higher among the married, and has increased according to the increases of deep-acting, social support, learning goal orientation, and performance goal orientation. To improve job satisfaction, dental healthcare institutions should be required to attempt  organizational changes and develop service education, self-development programs in order to raise goal orientation as part of human resource management."
차량 검출용 CNN 분류기의 실시간 처리를 위한 하드웨어 설계,2016,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'ADAS', 'FPGA', 'Vehicle Detection', 'Mechine Learning']","최근 딥 러닝을 중심으로 빠르게 발전하고 있는 기계학습 분류 알고리즘은 기존의 방법들보다 뛰어난 성능으로 인하여 주목받고 있다. 딥 러닝 중에서도 Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)는 영상처리에 뛰어나 첨단 운전자 보조 시스템(Advanced Driver Assistance System : ADAS)에서 많이 사용되고 있는 추세이다. 하지만 차량용 임베디드 환경에서 CNN을 소프트웨어로 동작시켰을 때는 각 Layer마다 연산이 반복되는 알고리즘의 특성으로 인해 수행시간이 길어져 실시간 처리가 어렵다. 본 논문에서는 임베디드 환경에서 CNN의 실시간 처리를 위하여 Convolution 연산 및 기타 연산들을 병렬로 처리하여 CNN의 속도를 향상시키는 하드웨어 구조를 제안한다. 제안하는 하드웨어의 성능을 검증하기 위하여 Xilinx ZC706 FPGA 보드를 이용하였다. 입력 영상은 36x36 크기이며, 동작주파수 100MHz에서 하드웨어 수행시간은 약 2.812ms로 실시간 처리가 가능함을 확인했다.","Recently, machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning-based algorithms, have been receiving attention due to its high classification performance. Among the algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is known to be efficient for image processing tasks used for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems(ADAS). However, it is difficult to achieve real-time processing for CNN in vehicle embedded software environment due to the repeated operations contained in each layer of CNN. In this paper, we propose a hardware accelerator which enhances the execution time of CNN by parallelizing the repeated operations such as convolution. Xilinx ZC706 evaluation board is used to verify the performance of the proposed accelerator. For 36x36 input images, the hardware execution time of CNN is 2.812ms in 100MHz clock frequency and shows that our hardware can be executed in real-time."

In developing the competence curriculum model, functionalism has been postulated along with liberal thought, which presents a partial model for vocational education. Respecting the totalistic nature of competence, I propose a metaphor of identity as a post-functionalistic model of curriculum development with a warm-competence-based curriculum. The term “identity” has taken on a great many different meanings in the literature. I sketch out but one approach that draws on a consistent strand of participation. I propose new directions for the development of an identity-based curriculum, as follows: First, personalized curriculum should be seen as a life project. Designing a personalized curriculum does not mean developing customized courses; instead, the courses should involve self-directed, deep, and long-term learning. The school curriculum should take support for individual learning portfolios as a primary principle in its development. Second, the curriculum should include subject and non-subject contents. A competence-based curriculum requires a critical perspective related to the dualism of knowledge and experience in favor of situated practice. The separation of the subject from non-subject curriculum in the current national curriculum should be re-organized. Third, a community-based curriculum should be developed. Living community features a classroom culture of mutual respect and caring based on practical ethics and the accountability of community members. A learning community allows the school to be transformed into a learning organization where members of the community form their identities. Fourth, a school culture should be fashioned that represents its own character. Competence is encouraged to develop through participation in a culture; this conditions the ecological environment of learning."
A Novel Adaptive Architecture Pruning Algorithm for Madalines,2016,"['Adaline', 'Madalines', 'sensitivity', 'network construction', 'pruning algorithm']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Nowadays, the big success of deep learning makes artificial neural network becoming a hot topic once again, and the size of neural networks’ structure is a key visual cue for structured learning. The greater network may get the study task done well, while it may increase network computation overhead easier and cost more. Hence, network construction is an important issue, as well as a difficult problem. In this paper, we proposed a novel sensitivity-based adaptive architecture pruning algorithm for Madalines. The algorithm establishes a pruning measure based on the network sensitivity to its structure variation and a minimal disturbance principle. The measure can be used to evaluate the performance loss due to its structure changes more or less. And the loss can be compensated by relearning. Thus, the new adaptive pruning mechanism is developed with measuring, pruning, and compensating. The simulation experimental results based on some benchmark data demonstrate that the pruning measure is rationality and the new algorithm is effective."

The way of repetition and enumeration expression in his writings proves that all existence is valuable and worthy of deep concern as his ecological point of view. Secondly, he reflected a feature of human being through the existence of insect. He considered human and insect as the same species keeping the same attribute. So he placed the ecology of insect and the features of human in juxtaposition, carried out his own writing to introspect human inner world. Thirdly, Ee Ok stands on the position of things and talked as they talk in their position in a way of personification. Basically the prose of personification had been a way of representing intellectual refinement of noble men. But Ee Ok’s personification was to include the nature of things. After all, this study searches for the meaning of Ee Ok’s ecological writing, comparing with Yeon Am, Park Ji-Won’s ecological writing. Ee Ok and Yeon Am have similar point of view toward and about things themselves.

Considered as one of the most destructive natural disasters ever recorded, it had far-reaching consequences. When news of the Lisbon quake spread, it inspired an intellectual debate, not only in Portugal but in all of Europe, about the natural world and God`s place in human affairs. Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant etc. took up the disaster as a vehicle to express their own Enlightenment ideas. In this article I focus on the controversy between Voltaire and Rousseau on the Lisbon earthquake. Voltaire learns, at the end of November 1755, that Lisbon undergoes an earthquake such a magnitude that the victims amount “a hundred thousand”, and, in early December, he composes in Alexandrine verse “Poem on the Lisbon disaster. Or an Examination of the Axiom, `All is Well`”. This French philosopher criticise, in his “Poem”, Leibniz`s concept of theodicy as well as the axiom of Alexander Pope “Whatever is, is right.”, suggesting that the massive destruction of the “unhappy mortals”, victims of the Lisbon earthquake demonstrated that God was not providing the “best of all possible worlds”. Then the quarrel festers when Rousseau contradicts, in a reply to the poem of Voltaire, the concept of providence exposed in the “Poem”. For Rousseau, it is not God but human beings and their civilization who are really responsible for this enormous sacrifice. First of all, I indicate the points of dispute between the two philosophers. Then, I try to reveal the deep-rooted reasons of the difference which results from differences in their world-views as well as their religious viewpoints. Finally, I bring to light the implication of the controversy in terms of the formation of the Enlightenment."

The fact that the meaning of “Change(變)” in modern society is used even more important is the reason to place importance in the meaning of “Change(變)”. Under these circumstances, it is meaningful to investigate how Zhuang-zi, the free spirit of the axile era thought about the meaning of “Change(變)”. To do this, the meaning of ‘change(變)’ and the usage of ‘change(變)’ in ≪Zhuang-zi≫ are looked through. The number ‘change(變)’ used in ≪Zhuang-zi≫ is a total of 31 times with the exception used in the sense of 辯. Of course, the use of “change(變)” in ≪Zhuang-zi≫ is not very different from normal use. In some sense this is a kind of Tautology, because “change(變)” in some sense already contains the meaning of “change(變)” in premise of “change(變)”. In this paper, based on these objective indicators, the characteristics of those used in each example and the features of the back side of each used example are examined. This is similar in relation of Signifier and Signifee in semiotics. In this paper, focusing on Signifier, patterns of “change(變)” found in ≪Zhuang-zi≫are learned.. This work was approached structurally in connection with ‘nature(自然)’. Unlike the other ideas, “Change(變)” in ≪Zhuang-zi≫ has a deep connection with nature. Zhuang-zi discovered the changes in nature, and it was philosophically sublimated through the reason in that place. Phenomenon changed, but the principles and the source of its back has always maintenance. Knowing Tao and Reaching the state of acquaintances is possible when one interacts with the maintenance to face the changes, This can be still valid to be applied to the modern world. To observe the nature and to apply the Tao of the change to the human society seems in line with analogical and correlative characters of Oriental Thought. Humans can not live away from nature. At large human beings also is a natural after all. As the correlative thoughts has been extended to Chinese medical to heal human body, the natural principles of “Change(變)” observed in nature also can be extended correlatively to treat human and cure human society meaningfully. So today even though fatigue of change is experienced here, the philosophy of ‘change’ in ≪Zhuang-zi≫ can present a plan of solving the problem faced in this era beyond refreshing to us."

Although Korea has been operating for years a couple of informal channels for discussion of major themes in its macroeconomy and finance including macroprudential policy issues relating to systemic risk and financial stability, recent evidence shows that they cannot be relied upon at all to serve the role of the macroprudential policy authorities. This stands in s contrast to the fact that many countries each have already been formally operating their own institutional arrangements for macroprudential policy, on the heels of the global financial crisis. This paper aims at designing the Korean institutional framework for macroprudential policy that should meet the basic requirements for the effective conduct of macroprudential policy and, at the same time, be adequately attuned to the institutional realities in Korea. In order to do so, Section II provides a literature review, which leads us to the finding that central banks are generally expected either to be charged with macroprudential policy as the competent authority or to play at least an important role therein. The emphasis given to the role of central banks reflects the general understanding that the effective conduct of macroprudential policy requires “a strong institutional framework” that should be built on both the “willingness to act” and the “ability to act.” Further, several typologies of stylized theoretic models found in the literature are briefly reviewed and discussed. On the basis of this literature review and in full consideration of institutional realities in Korea, Section III of the paper comes up with a two-step minimalist approach in its exploration of an appropriate model that should suit Korea properly and effectively. As a result, the paper finds one in the two-party council, tentatively titled the Macroprudential Policy Council (MaPC), in which participate the Bank of Korea (BOK) as the cental bank on one hand, and both the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) as the prudential regulator on the other. Note that in line with the paper`s minimalist approach MaPC consists of the two core authorities including BOK and FSC/FSS, with the Ministry of Finance and Strategy (MOSF) excluded. This feature is embedded in the model in view of the deep-rooted Confucianist cultural tradition in Korea where “the vertical institutional hierarchy” has long been entrenched. As long as the macroprudential policy framework is mandated to deal with the prevention side of crisis only, the two parties will suffice. In addition, this minimalist approach will contribute to mitigating effectively such inherent tendencies as “group-think” to which multi-agency councils are deemed vulnerable. The two-party council may well have considerable significance in the sense that it can be interpreted to be a natural arrangement resulting from the process of institutional evolution, as was evidenced in case of the Council for Cooperation on Macroprudential Policy that existed, though briefly, in Sweden for a couple of years back in 2012 and 2013. Note also that in line with the paper`s two-step approach MaPC is designed to take its first step to the beginning stage which allows each participant to buy enough time to get adjusted and prepared before taking its second step to move on to the completion stage. This feature importantly reflects the fact that BOK currently leaves much to be improved in terms of its willingness and ability to act, whereas FSC, along with the FSS, needs to learn how to cooperate and coordinate with BOK in macroprudential policy. In the first stage, BOK is left with few policy tools of its own to be used distinctively for the macroprudential policy purposes, while FSC/FSS, in their capacity of microprudential policy authorities, own and control most macroprudential tools. In the second stage, however, a few cyclical macroprudential tools could be assigned to BOK, which is generally expected to hold comparative advantage in analyzing and dealing with, if anything, the cyclical dimension of systemic risk. What is particularly unique about MaPC lies in a couple of specific rules that govern its modus operandi. The Council is supposed to apply either the `consultation` rule or the `positive endorsement` rule, depending on whether a proposed item on the agenda one party submits to MaPC for discussion is to request, via consultation, the other to act, or to seek positive endorsement from the other so as to carry out one`s own plan to act. Once it is either consulted or positively endorsed as the case may be, the submission will have become a recommendation issued in public by the Council with its addressee being obliged to `comply or explain`. Considering that most policy tools are in the hands of the financial supervisory authorities, these specific rules governing MaPC are contrived mainly for the purpose of ensuring BOK to exert checks and balances effectively upon FSC/FSS. Finally provided in Section IV are conclusive remarks on potential merits and limits of the institutional framework which this paper has proposed."
딥러닝의 모형과 응용사례,2016,"['딥러닝', '합성곱신경망', '순환신경망', '오류역전파 알고리즘', 'Deep learning', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'Error backpropagation algorithm']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Deep learning model is a kind of neural networks that allows multiple hidden layers. There are various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks. Those have been applied to fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition and bioinformatics where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks. Among those architectures, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are classified as the supervised learning model. And in recent years, those supervised learning models have gained more popularity than unsupervised learning models such as deep belief networks, because supervised learning models have shown fashionable applications in such fields mentioned above.  Deep learning models can be trained with backpropagation algorithm. Backpropagation is an abbreviation for “backward propagation of errors” and a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent. The method calculates the gradient of an error function with respect to all the weights in the network. The gradient is fed to the optimization method which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the error function.  Convolutional neural networks use a special architecture which is particularly well-adapted to classify images. Using this architecture makes convolutional networks fast to train. This, in turn, helps us train deep, muti-layer networks, which are very good at classifying images. These days, deep convolutional networks are used in most neural networks for image recognition. Convolutional neural networks use three basic ideas: local receptive fields, shared weights, and pooling. By local receptive fields, we mean that each neuron in the first(or any) hidden layer will be connected to a small region of the input(or previous layer’s) neurons. Shared weights mean that we’re going to use the same weights and bias for each of the local receptive field. This means that all the neurons in the hidden layer detect exactly the same feature, just at different locations in the input image. In addition to the convolutional layers just described, convolutional neural networks also contain pooling layers. Pooling layers are usually used immediately after convolutional layers. What the pooling layers do is to simplify the information in the output from the convolutional layer. Recent convolutional network architectures have 10 to 20 hidden layers and billions of connections between units. Training deep learning networks has taken weeks several years ago, but thanks to progress in GPU and algorithm enhancement, training time has reduced to several hours.  Neural networks with time-varying behavior are known as recurrent neural networks or RNNs. A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. Early RNN models turned out to be very difficult to train, harder even than deep feedforward networks. The reason is the unstable gradient problem such as vanishing gradient and exploding gradient. The gradient can get smaller and smaller as it is propagated back through layers. This makes learning in early layers extremely slow. The problem actually gets worse in RNNs, since gradients aren’t just propagated backward through layers, they’re propagated backward through time. If the network runs for a long time, that can make the gradient extremely unstable and hard to learn from. It has been possible to incorporate an idea known as long short-term memory units (LSTMs) into RNNs. LSTMs make it much easier to get good results when traini"

CNN 기반의 와일드 환경에 강인한 고속 얼굴 검출 방법,2016,"['Face Detection', 'Deep Learning', 'Fully Convolutional Network', 'Heat Map', 'Facial Component', 'Face Bound Regression']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Face detection is the first step in a wide range of face applications. However, detecting faces in the wild is still a challenging task due to the wide range of variations in pose, scale, and occlusions. Recently, many deep learning methods have been proposed for face detection. However, further improvements are required in the wild. Another important issue to be considered in the face detection is the computational complexity. Current state-of-the-art deep learning methods require a large number of patches to deal with varying scales and the arbitrary image sizes, which result in an increased computational complexity. To reduce the complexity while achieving better detection accuracy, we propose a fully convolutional network-based face detection that can take arbitrarily-sized input and produce feature maps (heat maps) corresponding to the input image size. To deal with the various face scales, a multi-scale network architecture that utilizes the facial components when learning the feature maps is proposed. On top of it, we design multi-task learning technique to improve detection performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the FDDB dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the accuracy of 82.33% at 517 false alarms, while improving computational efficiency significantly."

Arbitrary point among the 3D point cloud can represents its signature in its sky surface by using several neighborhood points. The unit spherical surface centered on that point can be considered to accumulate the evidence of each angular tessellation. According to a kind of point area such as wall, ground, tree, car, and so on, the results of spherical signature description look so different each other.

What is theoretically at stake in this task is to find a way of integrating imagination and rationality in teaching and learning knowledge, the roles of which have been wrongly considered separate and even contradictory in the function of the human mind. To do so, it first reconstructs a Canadian educational philosopher Kieran Egan`s philosophically historical review of the concept of imagination. This will lead us to establish an educationally constructive concept of imagination, the concept which has been traditionally underestimated in its educational utility due to its subordinated status to reason or rationality in constituting human consciousness or intentionality. Secondly, it will examine Lev Vygotsky`s developmental theory of imagination to draw some pedagogical implications in teaching and learning, namely how to develop and foster imagination in an educationally meaningful manner. The reconstruction of Egan`s view on the conceptual development of imagination will show how the concept has been evolved along with the change in our world view, making a shift from the secondary human faculty being in service of the absolute God in the pre-modern world gradually into the primary human faculty to construct and create human meanings and values as the source of active thinking in the modern world. Parallel to the conceptual shift, our examination of Vygotsky`s theory of imagination traces his ideas on how the imagination in childhood develops into the imagination in the adolescent; the imagination in two stages takes completely different forms and paths in their development. According to Vygotsky, the imagination in the adolescent is critical to the development of the higher mental functions of human faculties including conceptual thinking, which has been one of the critical concern in knowledge education. Here the distinction and collaboration between visual conceptualization as a form of generalization and abstract conceptualization as a form of abstraction are addressed with a great importance to reveal their independent and interactive roles in the higher functions of the human mind. Lastly, this essay concludes with Egan`s idea of deep learning, which shows the importance of imagination in knowledge education. It is suggested as an educationally proper response to the malaise of exam-obsessed culture of knowledge education in Korea. For learning in depth is a form of learning for higher mental ability which requires the development of imagination, first and foremost."
CNN 기반의 와일드 환경에 강인한 고속 얼굴 검출 방법,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Face detection is the first step in a wide range of face applications. However, detecting faces in the wild is still a challenging task due to the wide range of variations in pose, scale, and occlusions. Recently, many deep learning methods have been proposed for face detection. However, further improvements are required in the wild. Another important issue to be considered in the face detection is the computational complexity. Current state-of-the-art deep learning methods require a large number of patches to deal with varying scales and the arbitrary image sizes, which result in an increased computational complexity.To reduce the complexity while achieving better detection accuracy, we propose a fully convolutional network-based face detection that can take arbitrarily-sized input and produce feature maps (heat maps) corresponding to the input image size. To deal with the various face scales, a multi-scale network architecture that utilizes the facial components when learning the feature maps is proposed. On top of it, we design multi-task learning technique to improve detection performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the FDDB dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the accuracy of 82.33% at 517 false alarms, while improving computational efficiency significantly."

When used in the curriculum, danso has many great advantages. It is very portable, has a tranquil tone, and helps one practice one’s self-control exercise through abdominal breathing, a deep, long breathing skill. Although it is being replaced with the sogeum because it is relatively difficult to make sounds and requires great patience during practice, danso still plays an important role as an introduction to the Korean traditional music.The number of people who can play danso has increased since danso education became part of the school curriculum. However, there is room for reconsideration of whether there has been improvements in quality of danso performance. There are many reasons for this, but one of the main reasons is the importance of the textbook. For danso learning experience in a school environment to carry on into everyday life, the improvement of textbook approachability and development of textbooks for different performance levels are inevitable.This research first examines 44 textbooks out of the various danso music scores and textbooks published after the liberation of Korea, by dividing them into theory, music classification and analysis. Then textbooks with a high ratio of folk songs were selected and compared in a musical, contextual setting. The findings indicated that the section of performing techniques such as fingering, body positioning and how to make sounds and lip shape was generally well described, but there was an insufficient amount of contents as regards with breathing method. As for learning method, learning through different levels of difficulty was proposed, and as for curriculum and textbook connection, it was observed that there was a higher ratio of traditional children’s songs since the 7th Revised National Music Ceducational Curriculum. As for music classification and analysis, levels can be classified into beginner, intermediate and advanced, depending on the level of difficulty of music. What is noteworthy is that Kyonggi folk songs took up a high percentage, and, as a result, there is an imbalance in the weight put on various folk songs. Based on these observations, it is verified that developing danso textbooks for different levels is necessary. Moreover, we propose placing equal amounts of music from various geographic regions, utilizing ensembles and developing separate textbooks for pyeongjol danso and improved danso."

Data Randomization and Cluster-Based Partitioning for Botnet Intrusion Detection,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Botnets, which consist of remotely controlled compromised machines called bots, provide a distributed platform for several threats against cyber world entities and enterprises. Intrusion detection system (IDS) provides an efficient countermeasure against botnets. It continually monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential vulnerabilities and possible existence of active attacks. A payload-inspection-based IDS (PI-IDS) identifies active intrusion attempts by inspecting transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol packet's payload and comparing it with previously seen attacks signatures. However, the PI-IDS abilities to detect intrusions might be incapacitated by packet encryption. Traffic-based IDS (T-IDS) alleviates the shortcomings of PI-IDS, as it does not inspect packet payload; however, it analyzes packet header to identify intrusions. As the network's traffic grows rapidly, not only the detection-rate is critical, but also the efficiency and the scalability of IDS become more significant. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art T-IDS built on a novel randomized data partitioned learning model (RDPLM), relying on a compact network feature set and feature selection techniques, simplified subspacing and a multiple randomized meta-learning technique. The proposed model has achieved 99.984% accuracy and 21.38 s training time on a well-known benchmark botnet dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms other well-known machine-learning models used in the same detection task, namely, sequential minimal optimization, deep neural network, C4.5, reduced error pruning tree, and randomTree.</P>"

In content organization, middle school history is organized by focusing on a subject, so is different from Korean history in high school constructed with syntax structure focusing on political history. In content construction, middle school history, Korean history in high school, world history, and East Asian history are divided into five fields, and a method that big idea(key concept) is made as an organizer of contents so is made as the central axis penetrating grade is selected. Five results that content construction of 2015 revised middle school history curriculum is analyzed by focusing on characteristics and problems of key competencies becoming a reference frame of a curriculum, big idea playing a role of a content organizer, and validity of content construction focusing on a subject can be arranged. First, a clear concept of key competencies is not agreed yet. In addition, there is no significant differences between key subject competences suggested in a history curriculum and historical thinking, and key subject competences are also impertinent to be made as standards of content selection and construction of a curriculum. Second, ‘big idea(key concept)’ suggested as a frame of content construction is a super ordinate concept involving various concepts, so content elements based on individually historical truths are selected as key concept in comparison to a constituting principle of a curriculum enabling deep learning as an organizer combining fields in a subject, so it goes against a principle of a curriculum. Key concept constituting fields has the meaning of simple content elements, and is closer to characteristic as a subject rather than a concept. In addition, it is difficult to find a community combining Korean history and world history, and the meaning as an organizer connecting historical contents is weak. Third, the intention to constitute historical contents in middle school by focusing on a subject is to differentiate contents in middle school from contents in high school. However, when a study on a sequence method is referred, it is organized by focusing on a subject in middle school because syntax structure understanding the flow of history is better fitted for a method retrogressing an understanding of students in middle school. A subject is the meaning as learning experience that students can investigate a particular subject deeply in the learning process rather than a content construction principle of a curriculum, so is impertinent to be made as a content construction principle of a curriculum. Fourth, if detailed purposes, field system table, and achievement standards of a history curriculum are examined, a difference of content construction between middle school history and Korean history in high school is not clear, and there is a problem that political history should be repeated for elementary, middle, and high schools. Fifth, a method to reduce scope and contents treated in a world history field is selected to lighten academic pressure of students. As a result, the world history field does not treat history except for Chinese history, European history, and some of Japanese history in middle school history. This is because the reality of history education is not properly understood, so finally, this will cause desolation of world history education."

Frequency, exploratory factor, reliability, independent samples t-test, and a paired samples t-test, qualitative analysis (open questionnaire, deep interview, and observation journals) were conducted for analyzing data. In results, there was a significantly difference in the dance class satisfaction in terms of educational satisfaction factor (t=2.60*), societal satisfaction factor (t=3.18**), program satisfaction factor (t=2.64**), and psychological satisfaction factor (t=2.12*); only in the imagery training group, there was a difference between the pre-test and post-test results for educational satisfaction factor (t=3.65***), societal satisfaction factor (t=4.77***), psychological satisfaction factor (t=2.15*). The effects of imagery on students in general dance education affected ""movement memory"" (remembering order, self-correcting), ""self-confidence"" (increasing commitment, increasing learning motivation), ""motor performance"" (increasing of exercise adaptive ability, learning by thinking). Thus, if proper imagery education were to be a priority, we can expect positive learning when using imagery as a class tool in general dance education."

Approximate Bayesian MLP regularization for regression in the presence of noise,2016,"['Bayesian method', 'Multilayer perceptron training', 'Non-smooth regression', 'Regularization', 'Weight-decay']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We present a novel regularization method for a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that learns a regression function in the presence of noise regardless of how smooth the function is. Unlike general MLP regularization methods assuming that a regression function is smooth, the proposed regularization method is also valid when a regression function has discontinuities (non-smoothness). Since a true regression function to be learned is unknown, we examine a training set with our Bayesian approach that identifies non-smooth data, analyzing discontinuities in a regression function. The use of a Bayesian probability distribution identifies the non-smooth data. These identified data is used in a proposed objective function to fit an MLP response to the desired regression function regardless of its smoothness and noise. Experimental simulations show that the MLP with our presented training method yields more accurate fits to non-smooth functions than other MLP training methods. Further, we show that the suggested training methodology can be incorporated with deep learning models."

DNN-Based Feature Enhancement Using DOA-Constrained ICA for Robust Speech Recognition,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is often degraded in adverse real-world environments. In recent times, deep learning has successfully emerged as a breakthrough for acoustic modeling in ASR; accordingly, deep neural network (DNN)-based speech feature enhancement (FE) approaches have attracted much attention owing to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, DNN-based approaches are unable to achieve remarkable performance improvements for speech with severe distortion in the test environments different from training environments. In this letter, we propose a DNN-based FE method where the DNN inputs include preenhanced spectral features computed from multichannel input signals to reconstruct noise-robust features. The preenhanced spectral features are obtained by direction-of-arrival (DOA)-constrained independent component analysis (DCICA) followed by Bayesian FE using a hidden-Markov-model prior, to exploit the capabilities of efficient online target speech extraction and efficient FE with prior information for robust ASR. In addition, noise spectral features computed from DCICA are included for further improvement. Therefore, the DNN is trained to reconstruct a clean spectral feature vector, from a sequence of corrupted input feature vectors in addition to the corresponding preenhanced and noise feature vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves recognition performance, even in mismatched noise conditions.</P>"

Thus, although it is challenging, development of detection technologies in a shallow aquifer region is essential to assure the long term safety of a CCS project. Recently, field scale experiments were carried out around the world to identify CO2 leakage and to investigate effects on groundwater quality in shallow aquifers.From the literature, 8 controlled CO2 release test sites and 9 experimental cases were identified. In those sites, CO2 was artificially injected around the shallow aquifer region as CO2-infused groundwater phase or gas phase for identifying environmental effects caused by CO2 injection. This paper reviews the hydraulic heterogeneity, mineral compositions, monitoring systems, and environmental parameters required for leakage detection at each site. For constructing a controlled test bed, inclined wells, horizontal wells, and multiple injection wells were identified as reliable injection components. It was also identified that the injected CO2 migration and its effects were monitored through the constructed monitoring networks.The previous operation cases show that continuous monitoring of pH, electrical conductivity (EC), Ca and Mg concentrations is the most basic and important factor for leakage detection. Trace elements and isotopes were also widely used to determine the CO2 leakage.The Korea CO2 Storage Environmental Management (K-COSEM) research center is going to construct an environmental impact test (EIT) facility for developing CO2 leakage detection methods in a shallow aquifer region in Korea. The challenging issues will include the fate and transport of CO2 from the fractured zone to the saturated zone and to the unsaturated soil. Based on the lessons learned from the previous tests, environmental monitoring technologies will be developed through the analysis of the time series data of hydrogeochemical parameters for the planned EIT facility in Korea."

Bridging Constructivist Theories and Design Practice for Children to Grow as Active Technology Users,2016,"['Technology', 'Children', 'Development Theory', 'Constructivist Theory', 'Children Computer Interaction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background Technology has become pervasive in our lives and children’s development is closely affected by using it. Technology designs for children should be based on a deep understanding of children and their development. A closer link between developmental theories and design practice is needed to meet children’s needs and to support them to become active learners and users of technology.  Methods This research reviews constructivist theories, specifically the cognitive constructivism and social constructivism of Piaget, Papert, and Vygotsky. These theories suggest a perspective to see children as active agents who interact with their environment and learn through it. The theories explain how children develop through cognitive, physical, and social experiences, and give insights for design practices.  Results By reviewing the theories, this research suggests implications for designing technology for children: 1) technology should support children’s developmental needs; 2) technology should be personalized to each child and support children in becoming creators; and 3) technology should support social interactions. Also, it presents how the theories can be applied to design practice using the examples of littleBits, KIBO, and DigiTile.  Conclusions To design technology that supports children in becoming active users and creators of technology, designers should design carefully based on an understanding of how children learn and develop. The constructivist theories can guide designers through their design process, help in making design decisions, and offer ways to verify designs in order to ensure that the design supports children’s development."

Cheongdae, a member of Nam party in Yeungnam had stated his esteemed opinion expressing a tone of flexibility, having been interested in the literary works of two writers, Kim Changhyup of Noron and Imjae, an outsider. At the same time, he followed  the principle of Onyudonhu(溫柔敦厚) by Yi Hwang, a member of the Nam party in Yeungnam, and showed an attitude of avoiding writing novel literature. When it comes to the present conditions of his poetry and prose, 164 chinese poems with 110 titles and 12 proses are included in 『Cheongdae Journal』. It suggests that the Chinese poems are much greater than the prose in number. As for the creation period, many works were done throughout his twenties until  his mid fifties. Among them, only twenty-three Chinese poems and two proses were all included in 『Cheongdae's Collection』, which was published posthumously. That means 121 Chinese poems and 11 proses were omitted in 『Cheongdae's Collection』 but were included in 『Cheongdae Journal』. As part of Cheongdae's valuable literary works, they contained not only his personal monologue but also public records he left while working as a government official.In chapter 3, the paper studied the content and features of the literary works in 『Cheongdae Journal』 focusing on his Chinese poems, classifying them into four areas 'his youth aspirations and academic orientation', 'secret stories , duty as a government official and intellectual’s consciousness for the people’, 'Oryeong(吾嶺) ceremony and sightseeing record' and ‘the imagery of separation and death'. 『Cheongdae Journal』 shows a candid Cheongdae in his youth, who intends to embody respect(敬), justice(義), and as well as a vigorous youth. Wolgwasi(月課詩) was written when he was assigned to Seungmunwon after a successful state examination shows Cheongdae's sensuous poetic talent. In addition, it contains government officials' secret stories(祕話) and the consciousness for the people as a Yeungnam intellectual.Cheongdae as a member of Nam party in Yeungnam also explored the beautiful scenery of Yeungnam including Sangju, Andong, etc. and he expressed its beauty and affection for the Silla Dynasty in a Chinese poem, which reveals that he brought the political posture called 'we Yeongnam(吾嶺)' to his creation of literature. He left a large number of memorial poems(挽詩), which reflect his sense of documentation intending to console the deep sorrow of the people who died of disease and famine and remembering the unknown people.The Cheongdae shown in the literary works of 『Cheongdae Journal』 so far was a man of flexibility and at the same time a man of principle. Though he was excellent in poetry and prose, he was rather interested in the discipline of confucianism. He also tried to establish his own identity as a member of Nam party in Yeungnam and reflect it in his literary works. He was a man with a gentle nature who reflected in depth about humanity and death and could sympathize with pain of others."

Such lack causes fragmentation between content and methods of teaching and also initiates a method-centered approach to teaching without attention to sound and deep understanding of the contents of the text. Another problem in teaching the Bible is the individualized and privatized understanding of Christian faith. Taking these issues into consideration, this paper attempts to propose an alternative approach that can integrate biblical exegesis, theology, and theory of Christian education as well as teach diakonia in terms of the Decalogue for volunteers serving in high-poverty neighborhoods. The Decalogue has been chosen as the theme of Bible teaching in an attempt to transform the privatized personal and ecclesial practices of the current Korean Christians and church, thus calling attention to the importance of diakonia as core practice of the church. Based on literature-based methodology, this paper first gives exegeses on the text of the Decalogue in the book of Exodus 20:1-21 in dialogue with biblical theology. Then this paper aims to relate the theological method and content of Bible teaching in terms of Minjung theology, especially focusing on its concept of “confluences of the two stories.” In addition, Thomas Groome’s “theory of shared praxis” joins in the conversation with biblical theology and Minjung theology. Thus, 1) the exegesis on the text of the Decalogue, 2) Minjung theology’s “confluences of the two stories” for the poor and, 3) dialectical conversation between the Story and our story, in terms of Groome’s “theory of shared praxis” are confluenced when teaching diakonia. This type of teaching that integrates theory and praxis is called “incarnational teaching,” which lies at the focus of this paper. Finally, an example of the teaching-learning plan and questions for group work are proposed for practical use."

The dance originates from Yukdae-Daemu of ancient China. The dancing posture of Munmyo-Ilmu focuses on its spirit rather than on the form of the dance, because it depicts Confucian philosophy. As the dance was composed to reflect such deep meaning and philosophy, we say that it uses ``Saeui``-style (spritual) expression. The posture of the Mun-Mu dance, which celebrates Confucius and his preceding prominent saints, represents virtuousness; and the posture of the Mu-Mu dance, which praises the valiant spirit and righteous fidelity of warriors, symbolizes majesty. As such Munmyo-Ilmu, enlightening virtue, reaches a state that evokes harmony of heaven and earth and, furthermore, expresses a prayer for peace. The extreme significance of unchangeable eternity is expressed and communicated to the audience in the form of this simple dance.

Marginalization of women in developing creative activities using the exclusive property of holding the Chinese men lost their function as a universal language in particular was more severe. When these Sanuidang Kim(1769∼1823) was born in Jeonbuk Namwon and made three fundamental virtues that grew up learning the rules of strict Confucian traditions living in the villages fall from Warrior, effects, light, obedience outlook on life. So are women oppressive social structures continue being a unique person, a hyeonmoyangcheo creative poetry with pride that exists among the faithful at the time independent of the role of women hyobu activities without oysters. As most women so much work over the alleged left a 『samuidang Kim missus posthumous work』 Writings left a vast amount of poetry and convenience sentence of 22 to 99 pieces (total number 253).

Which form the background of her literature can understand the beautiful scenery of the extraordinary literary atmosphere of the laws and husband, and she lived with Namwon and Jinan.

Thus was perfected husband is responsible for about a dozen years of hard farm work and livelihood are couples and study in a temple in Seoul are fully consistent with the body of a woman ordinary person for themselves and earn a living while farewell needy. This being so her life or consciousness, and things and poetic perceptions and emotions felt over this, there is a significant difference with other women aristocrat familly. As a woman of villages samuidang Warrior is a story sewn deep set and put in the hearts and overcome the various adverse conditions, sublimation purification was steadily through Chinese poem. Samuidang all the surrounding circumstances or the real one, such as the center of their life has been adopted by topic or material.

She was taking care of her husband devotedly and understand that the best filial piety, only her husband’s rising in the world and gaining fame is offering to parents, samuidang is in and letters sent to her husband for the past ready reiterated that strive only while excluding thoroughly their feelings academic and when the encouraging exhortation form the mainstream. However, as shown in the anguish of a grass widow poem other  ristocrat familly when she ought to use the bold expression was not found written poetry for Scream exhausting every moment of reality that can not be set out and parting like a sigh. This is also the downfall though one of the most striking features of the villages, even if she Warrior honest to accept their situation and environment actively, subjectively written by showing that true to his emotions samuidang poetry.

As a result of this study, three key points were discovered: First, the evaluation score increased with frequent feedback or long discussions. On the other hand, with less feedback, the evaluation score didn`t rise. Second, there were three types of improvement in inquiry related to peer review: No. 1 was improvement after feedback given by themselves. No. 2 was reflection of feedback given to other groups. As a last type, No. 3 was that the students learned from other groups` presentation without any feedback and improved their inquiry. Third, there were five kinds of giving feedback; (1) feedback understanding the inquiry correctly, (2) insufficiency of peer`s inquiry without deep thought. (3) on the usefulness of the inquiry, (4) on the scientific and logic validity through critical thinking, and (5) how to develop the inquiry. In these kinds of feedback, the fourth kind of feedback (4) occurred most frequently but the fifth (5) occurred rarely.

Study on Virtual Reality and E-commerce,2016,"['VR', 'E-commerce', 'ICT', 'AR.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Electronic commerce (E-commerce) using virtual reality (VR) has the advantage of being able to purchase products without restrictions of time and location by overcoming the limitations of existing offline  transactions. It is still a rudimentary but fast growing technology, and the use of E-commerce in VR is expanding. The barriers that consumers might face in utilizing E-commerce in VR is the relevance to Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) technology. Fundamentally, it requires Internet access and use  through PCs or mobile devices such as smart phones. Because unlike off-line markets, it is difficult to determine  the purchase patterns of customers, customer purchasing behavior analysis must be done using computer  access records. In order to expand and develop E-commerce in VR in the future, learning ability should be  improved through combining with artificial neural network by deep learning that is recently in the spotlight, and the ability to overcome errors need to be improved to enable use in various fields."

Siwonhan-mat: The third taste of Korean foods,2016,"['compounded taste', 'gipeun-mat (깊은 맛)', 'kan (간)', 'Korean food', 'siwonhan-mat (시원한 맛)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: Smell and taste are frequently referenced senses when describing flavors of food. In addition to these two senses, Koreans have regarded that there is another sense of taste experienced through the body. This third sense, siwonhan-mat (시원한 맛), describes the sensation of the body including the tongue, stomach, and intestines when eating. While smell and taste play an important role in the enjoyment of food, it is also crucial to evaluate what your body can experience from eating. In this context, siwonhan-mat is the sense acquired through the digestion of food.Methods: This paper will discuss the third taste found in Korean food, siwonhan-mat. In addition, expressions, key elements, and examples of food with siwonhan-mat will be explored.Results: Siwonhan-mat is regarded as a unique taste found in Korean food. Of course, there are other descriptive Korean words for flavor such as kipeun-mat (깊은 맛, deep taste or deeper flavor) and kusuhan-mat (구수한 맛, one of delicate or pleasant taste), but they are similar to the traditional five tastes found in Korean food (saltiness, sourness, sweetness, bitterness, and spiciness) in the sense that they are received through the tongue. By contrast, siwonhan-mat is a refreshing taste experienced by the body during the digestive process. As for umami, part of the modern five basic tastes, it would be practical to subdivide it into a few different compounded tastes, such as kipeun-mat, kokumi, and kusuhan-mat. After conducting many studies about temperature, acidity, and sweetness of foods in order to find a determining factor for siwonhan-mat, researchers have concluded that kan, balancing the salt concentration of food, is closely related to the creation of the siwonhan-mat sensation.Conclusion: Siwonhan-mat is a unique sensation found in Korean food. Understanding siwonhan-mat is a key to learning about Korean food and its food culture. Therefore, this paper serves an important role in understanding Korean food. Siwonhan-mat is often mistranslated using words to describe temperature, such as cool. This misinterpretation has resulted in confusion over the original meaning of siwonhan-mat and contributed to the incorrect usage of the word."

These two for Korean traditional music education should be based on the cultural spirit of Korean traditional music. The original idea should be respected in the Korean traditional music education. However, the final goal of the Korean traditional music education for elementary and secondary school should not be the original idea but the future oriented educative activity toward the creation which is more positive and active than the original idea.The musical transfiguration which had lasted from the 6th century to the late 19th century is one of important Korean musical traditions. It was creative musical transfiguration which had characteristics of respecting the tradition of existing music and making new music based on the tradition. In other words, many pieces of Korean traditional music were based on musical cultural spirit which had made musical transfiguration possible from the existing traditional music and enlarged the number of repertoire through the way of new music making. The creative musical transfiguration was possible because there had been the traditional Korean’s view of music which valued and willingly accepted the musical transfiguration or change as a musical beauty.A deep introspection and rumination by a cognitive attitude on the world of creative musical transfiguration which found in Korean traditional music is needed for a better future-oriented creative elementary and secondary education of Korean traditional music. The meaning and value in the world of creative musical transfiguration should be properly evaluated, educated, continued and inherited to the future generations through elementary and secondary school education without any kind of hesitation or delay. The teaching and learning of Korean traditional music in school should be one of very meaningful, valuable and instructive satisfactory things. The music education of Korean traditional music for elementary and secondary school should aim at the instructive satisfaction which creates bright future and development. A right cognition and attitude on the creative musical figuration found in historical facts which based on tradition will help a lot to the creative future education of Korean traditional music.Achieving the aim of a desirable education of Korean traditional music for elementary and secondary school is not an easy job. It may be more difficult in the future. The difficulty, however, is not the object of shirk or fear but the object of overcome and sublimation. The good result of overcome and sublimation surely will come true if we challenge the difficulty in Korean traditional music education with effect.

First, it created various forms of manuscripts such as translated edition, annotated edition, Chinese-Korean edition, revised edition and vocabulary interpretation, and the title also displayed unusual phenomena by being called many different names. Second, although it was a popular literature, it showed the reading tendency of learning attitude as if readers read sacred books. Third, while each manuscript had their own distinct aspects, all of then showed unique systemicity and affinity among them revealing relational aspect of overall active mutual text. Fourth, Xixiangji became the only play that was read by the public through book rental shops by being re-made as a Korean novel with good readability in the end of the 19th century.

Causes of students`` problem behavior is due to remain in the unconscious an imperfect parenting attitude of the parents and main nourisher, the negative childhood experience, dissatisfaction with the need for students. Freud thought that the main cause of mental illness comes from lust, libido that are not met in childhood is to remain in their unconsciousness. Freud is derived ‘free association test’ as a tool to analyze the cause of mental illness. This study provides expansion possibilities ‘free association test’ can be excellent tools to analyze students’ behavior problems. This researcher have attention stage of the story and sympathy that the stage can make it ‘materialization’ the story of the unconscious part of the students. The story that contains the language uplifts the psychological well-being and emotional stability from long ago. Human evolved to bolster the ability to deal with the crisis on virtual reality and they learned the value of its time through story. In addition, this is a powerful force that led to society. So a desire to talk and the inclination of human beings immersed in story easily is woven deep into the structure of the brain. Also, evolution of the brain is inseparable from the development of culture and the emergence of language. The human brain is essentially a social. It evolved linking and coordinating between our brain and other people``s brain. Story has been a social features that can link other people. Cozolino thought permissive and sympathetic human relationships would be reorganizing the structure of the brain again like a stable attachment relationship between childhood parents. Furthermore, it is to integrate right and left hemispheres that came here have been disconnected so far by connecting a bridge. Namely, story is a powerful force that can heal the man. This researcher have attention psychologist, Rogers accomplishing remarkable achievements in theory and practice by ‘nondirective counseling’ to change the paradigm the educational arena. He was invented by human-centered counseling a the principle of ‘directional orientation’ and ‘sympathy’. He was certain that humans can change by sheer strength not a medical treatment but power of client and healer. Rogers’ principle is as follows. Firstly, the therapist can help client is changing its own based on sympathetic relationship between the therapist and client. Second, linked to integration of the brain treatment is facilitated after client becomes to write new positive stories. Namely, sympathy as well as in story, a powerful force that can lead to change the students. This study``s plays are not already a script written to depart from the preliminary text that do not belong with them differentiated with other plays. Students based on the story objectively watching their unconsciousness through up and perpetuating a place to study how to overcome suppression is on stage. Students will just a sustained, in-depth experience in their unconscious in our atmosphere of creative and voluntary and acceptable based on the imagination through improvisational play. Further they can rewrite his stories and express suppression. Freud mentioned that artists with a lot of mental cast of mind can sublimate libido into art, the students can also sublimate and express libido through play. Experience through play can help them reduced negative feelings and maintain a positive relationship with other by balance and integration through reorganizing of their brain. Accordingly, nervous and cheerful stress of forceful play will change the human by integrating brain which is perceived as real through their story. This is going to be at the same time as a dynamic cycle."
Deriving Topics for Safety of Folk Villages Following Scope and Content of ICT-Based DPD,2016,"['DPD(disaster prevention design)', 'UI(user interface)', 'USN(ubiquitous sensor network)', 'UD(universal design)', 'Folk Village', 'Monitoring System', 'Flood', 'Sign System']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper presents a novel concept of Disaster Prevention Design (DPD) and its derived subjects and topics for the safety of folk villages in both Korea and Japan. Nowadays, design concepts are focused on ‘human-oriented nature’ as a whole and this tendency fits to be appropriate for disaster prevention against real dangers of a future society, which is expected to have far more complicated features. On the other hand, convergences have performed with other areas in the field of Information Communication Technology (ICT) so that we can easily find examples like ‘the strategy of ICT-based convergence’ of the Korean Government in 2014. Modern content designs including UI (user interface) and USN (ubiquitous sensor network) have been developed as one of the representative areas of ICT & UD (universal design) convergences. These days this novel concept of convergence is overcoming the existing limitations of the conventional design concept focused on product and/or service. First of all, from that point our deduced topic or subject would naturally be a monitoring system design of constructional structures in folk villages for safety. We offer an integrated model of maintenance and a management-monitoring scheme. Another important point of view in the research is a safety sign or sign system installed in folk villages or traditional towns and their standardization. We would draw up and submit a plan that aims to upgrade signs and sign systems applied to folk villages in Korea and Japan. According to our investigations, floods in Korea and earthquakes in Japan are the most harmful disasters of folk villages. Therefore, focusing on floods in the area of traditional towns in Korea would be natural. We present a water-level expectation model using deep learning simulation. We also apply this method to the area of ‘Andong Hahoe’ village which has been registered with the World Cultural Heritage of UNESCO. Folk village sites include ‘Asan Oeam’, ‘Andong Hahoe’ and ‘Chonju Hanok’ villages in Korea and ‘Beppu Onsen’ village in Japan. Traditional Streets and Markets and Safe Schools and Parks are also chosen as nearby test-beds for DPD based on ICT. Our final goal of the research is to propose and realize an integrated disaster prevention and/or safety system based on big data for both Korea and Japan."

The study questions the narrowness in underlying understandings of financial education without financial markets, including formal content system of financial education. Thus, this paper offers a novel conceptual understanding of the concept of financial markets system in financial education based on existing academic literature, and suggests how financial markets newly position into the current financial education content. The educational management approaches can be extended into the realms of entire content system in financial literacy education.The argument of this paper is that it can be fruitful to understand financial markets in a dynamic and holistic manner with attention to extended individual and society dimensions in order to fully benefit from financial education and to make financial education a driving force for economic and social development. This paper provides a theoretical model that highlights some of the main factors involved in the relationship between real economy and financial markets. Research suggests that beyond acquiring knowledge and skill to act at real economy, learning on financial markets also involves the development of overall deep understanding about economic decision making. Yet most accounts of financial education do not include this concept.This is one of the first comprehensive studies to explore the importance of financial markets as the essence of the financial literacy education content system, and how the extended concept of financial markets can impact potential of economic development and growth in the modern economy and society. The outcome of this study provides unique insights into the comprehensive concept of financial markets positioned in new financial education system, contribute to theory in the areas of financial education. In addition, this study yields important policy and managerial implications to improve the state of financial education and to employ effective teaching methodologies in the area of financial education."

Further more, Spinoza should enable us to discover common humanity as common notion and realize the importance of the others based upon our understanding of each other in a deep and true sense."

This study aims to re-review the flexibilization of selection criteria. In middle school textbooks, there are literary texts in the body and popular songs or students`` works in the introduction and learning activities section in many cases. Such a dichotomous arrangement can, however, weaken the status of literary texts. It was in the Seventh Curriculum that novels of Park Wan-seo were first published in textbooks. Her works serve to bridge the canon gap, but there are some careless aspects in their selection for textbooks. The present study checked those aspects and confirmed that text selection was a very critical matter. It is required to examine candidate works meticulously to figure out whether they are good enough to inspire literary movement and thinking and deep enough to endure various and independent interpretations in addition to taking the experiences and developmental levels of students into  consideration"

However there are difference among metropolitan crime of each cities according to kind and frequency. But in Korea police has centralized system, the activities are very standardized and it occurs inefficiency. Crimes should be treated differently according to the nature of each cities just like men's health care system. In this report I will compare 7 metropolitan city crimes and especially look deep into characteristics of Daejeon's crimes and suggest solution. Also I will suggest the solution to build a crime prevention system in metropolitan community. First, when we compared 7 metropolitan cities all crimes, violent crimes, traffic related crimes, casualty of traffic accidents, crimes occurred in Daejeon were the least. However in the respect of analyzation of all crimes and main 5 crimes in Daejeon, murder, robbery, theft, violence were decreased. But rape was increasing rapidly. Therefore Dajeon should concentrate their police power on sexual crime and pay more attention on prevention instead of arrestment. Take special care on sexual criminals, increase patrols around the household where single women live, usage of big data system are the possible solutions. And for prevention of metropolitan crimes, build a cooperation system between police and citizens, government and citizens, city and private security systems are needed."

Jajang went to Chinese Tang and studied Buddhism for 5 years from AD 638 to 643.  Among Jajang’s acts in Jangan of Tang, what we can first see is that he was respected by Tang’s royal family. It means that Jajang was not just a monk to learn the Buddhism but a diplomat to represent Silla Dynasty. Furthermore, Jajang showed a miracle as the Yul(vinaya) master in Jangan right after entering Tang. It was even before he met Doseon(道宣) at Jongnamsan(終南山). With these, we can see that Jajang’s position as the Yul master was not acquired in Tang but in Silla already. And, from Beobsang(法常)’s respect toward Jajang, it is possible to infer the influence of Seobnonhag(攝論學) and Hwaeom Idea(華嚴思想).  Next, in his acts at Jongnamsan, Jajang stayed for 3 years at a grass cabin located in the east of Wunjesa(雲際寺) and made a miracle as Yul master. As he had a high position and firm dignity as the Yul master, it may be said that he associated with Doseon on the equal footing. In other words, Doseon’s influence on Jajang might be the horizontal communion rather than the vertical teaching.  Jajang’s acts in Tang had deep relation with his works as Daegugtong(大國統) for national Buddhism after returning to Silla. In this respect, the review of Jajang’s acts in Tang can have a sufficient significance in relation with Jajang’s life and Silla Buddhism."

When Korean culture is taught abroad, Korean studies should be based on further research on how to select and use appropriate resources for each different learning environment because of the teaching of Korean culture based on local contents. Therefore, using the Arirang TV programs as resources, this study investigates the responses of foreign learners studying Korean culture overseas on their understanding of Korean cultural contents in detail. As a result, this research demonstrates the beneficial use of the Arirang TV programs as teaching resources for foreign learners who are interested in building a deep understanding of Korean culture. Based on the results, a variety of drama-style resources in English could be more useful, practical, and essential in the teaching and learning of Korean culture overseas. This study is expected to be a useful reference for researchers who are searching for the appropriate selection and utilization of resources for countries abroad."

Deep distrust is widespread among the parents, and that leads them to rely more on private institutions than on public schools for the education of their children. Behind this anomalous phenomenon lies the fact that the level of one's education largely determines one's social status, economic success and the level of cultural life. For this reason, the educational systems in Korea tend to become too formalistic, unable to implement a more holistic ways of educating students which help students to experience maturation in the fullest sense of the word. This of course makes the already serious situation even worse, thereby putting the schools in an even deeper dilemma. Is there any ways of resolving this sorry situation? This study seeks the answer to this question from Calvin's view of school education. What is crucial in Calvin's approach to school education is that it was the church that first started school education basically as the extension of the church education. Thus, the school education consolidated and deepened what the students had learned from their worship, so that they might understand it fully and apply it effectively to their lives. On the other hand, the students were also required to practice both at church and school what they had learned at the school. Here the worship took on a crucial importance as the integrating factor in the students' Christian life. The present study examines the problems in the Korean school education and tries to see what answers we can get for them from the works of Calvin: what was the purpose of Calvin's school education, how did he actually carry it out, and what was the primary results of such educational efforts. We hope that this brief study can be of service in providng a turning point in the educational system of Korea."

Born at Yeongdong, Chungcheongbuk-do, Kwon, Jung-myeon was spending his life as an official in the late period of Joseon when he retired into a country as the nation fell, leading his old-age life while retiring to hermitage in Gyeryongsan Mountain. He left various sorts of iterary works; among others, Kwon, Jung-myeon created lotsof literary works ike keeping diaries, but they were almost lost, and about only 4 books of iterary collections have been passed to the present. This writing selected the Chinese poetry included in 『Gyeongjidangmicheong cho Sok4』created in 1917, and 『Gyeongjdangji Byeongja』created in 1936 as the objects for analysis. His old-age life and the result of this writing``s thinking about his works with focus on his Chinese poetry are as follows: First, Kwon, Jung-myeon was a retainer of King Gojong, who served as a government official in the late period of Joseon, and spend his old-age life while retiring to hermitage in Gyeryongsan Mountain when the nation fell. His Chinese poetry vividly represents his appearance of spending old-age life while wandering for all his life like QaYuan, longing for his home country, and cherishing the appearance of a lonely loyal subject. Second, Kwon, Jung-myeon strove for his mental, physical cultivation through the learning of Jonsimyangseong(proper cultivation of heaven-sent personality without losing conscience), and led his life of self-consolation(自寬). In addition, he spend his life assimilating himself with nature by pursuing the life free of a disgrace through preservation of his real intentions, and living in seclusion deep in the mountains in an inauspicious time. Third, Kwon, Jung-myeon, who was a Confucian scholar, he had a critical perspective about the social conditions which were changing into a new trend of the West, or Japanese culture. Also, he set up and suggested scientific technique and humanistic spirit as a relation of means and ends while pointing out people``s non-modest behavior although he acknowledged conveniences of modern civilization. Fourth, Kwon, Jung-myeon pursued his own life as a figure having a positive view of life. Transcending everything while regarding the past life as a dream, Kwon, Jung-myeon, who perceived his death intuitively, was devoted to creation of poetry even before he died. Kwon, Jung-myeon, who lived in the turbulent period from the late Joseon period to the period of Japanese occupation, is the figure not known to the world, but he is an authentic author who created poetry until his death. His world of works vividly exposes the diversity in poetic styles, his impressions about the current situation & changes in social conditions, and the inner world Kwon, Jung-myeon``s Chinese poetry is very invaluable in that his works clearly show the agonies and conflicts of ex-government officials during the late Joseon period, who had to live in the period of Japanese occupation. In this context, it is worthwhile to make an approach to Kwon, Jung-myeon``s world of works from a little more diverse aspects even for some periods to come."

The significance of this special feature is, first, that it overcomes the temptation of becoming emotional about the sensitive relationship between Joseon and Japan or self-contradictional derivation of conclusion with various opinions. Second, it can be highly appreciated as a presentation of vision for the future of responsible mass communication that it not only presented the keyword of the error of self absolutization, which Japan had fallen into, to swiftly solved the problems of Japan`s ignoring of Joseon, trying to usurp Joseon`s language, error of Japanese Joseon researchers, and Joseon policy, but also presented the correct findings on people of Joseon through the learning of Joseon language getting out of stereotype Joseon view made by Japanese people with Japanese language. Third, it did not stop at presenting issue of the phenomenons that are caused by the above problems but also presented new vision of the relationship between the two countries through actual examples. Finally, this special feature is not a stationary article stoping at diagnosing the pathology but it is an article moving toward the future by also presenting new prescription. But, on the other hand, it cannot be overlooked that it also exposes many things lacking. Logical arming against deep rooted conventionality and outdated assertions of Japanese writers still rampant today is missing, and the point that only relatively Joseon-friendly or Joseon-supporting Japanese people appeared without the stage of heated discussion for actual verbal battle with them is left as a room and limit that can face criticism of being complacent."

(1) 믿음의 현세적 삶은 영적인 삶에 기초한다. (2) 믿음의 현세적 삶 은‘오직 성경’(sola scriptura)에 기초한다. (3) 믿음의 현세적 삶은 합법적이고 정직한 직업을 통해 유지되고, 이 직업은 개인의 생활만 아니라 또한 하나님의 영광과 이웃의 복지를 위한 것이다. (4) 믿음의 현세적 삶은 평생 지속되는 영 성훈련의 과정이다. 청교도로부터 배우는 21세기 한국교회 영성훈련을 위한 네 가지 시사점들 은 한국교회의 영성의 퇴보로 인한 여러 가지 실패들을 실제적으로 치유할 수 있는 요점들을 가리켜준다. 첫째, Perkins의『잘 사는 법』은 신자의 영적인 삶 과 현세적 삶 사이의 긴밀한 연관성을 일깨워 주어, 성속(聖俗)을 구분하는 이 원론적 생활의 오류의 해독제가 된다. 둘째, Perkins의『잘 사는 법』은 신자의 합법적이고 정직한 직업 선택과 유지를 통해 교회의 사회적, 공적 영역에서의 긍정적 역할을 촉구한다. 개인구원 중심의 신앙과 윤리를 가정과 학교와 사회 의 보다 넓은 공공의 광장으로 이끌어내어 그리스도의 제자로서 세상의 빛과 소금의 역할을 감당케 한다. 셋째, Perkins의『잘 사는 법』은 신자의 현세적 직 업을 통한 믿음의 삶은‘오직 성경’의 원리를 따라 지속적으로 성장하고 성숙 하여‘오직 하나님께 영광이’돌려지는 삶을 살게 한다.","Facing with the danger of secularization based on materialism, Korean Church in the 21st century is struggling for life. Therefore nowadays Korean Church’s interest for spirituality including the new recognition of the identity and mission of Church is very higher than ever. We warmly welcome this interest for spiritual renewal and spiritual training by all Christians including theologians and pastors. From the history of Church and tradition we can get a mirror for reflecting the past of our lives, and at the same time attain a campus directing us to look for the future. So this writer draw lessons for our spirituality from the father of Puritanism, William Perkins, and whose book, How to Live, and that Well, which is well embodied of ‘intellectual piety’, a combination of both scriptural knowledge and deep piety. This writer analyses the book and points out four implications for our spiritual training today. (1) Present life of faith is based on spiritual life. (2) Present life of faith is founded in ‘sola scriptura’. (3) Present life of faith is maintained by lawful and honest callings, and these callings are not only for the life of individual, but also for the well-being of neighbours and eventually for the glory of God. (4) Present life of faith is a lifelong training course for spirituality. Such lessons for spiritual training learned from the puritans are medicines to the maladies of 21st century Korean Church caused by spiritual retrogression and failures. First, Perkins’ book, teaching the intimate relationship between the believer’s spiritual life and temporal life, is an antidote to the error of dualism of holiness and earthliness. Second, Perkins’ book demands Korean church to play a positive role in social and public areas, by choosing and maintaining lawful and honest callings. The book leads an individual centered faith and ethics of Korean Church to a public plaza of family, school, and society, and it causes the Church to live as a light and salt to the world. Third, Perkins’ book teaches the believer to continue to grow and maturate in ‘sola scriptura’ through the earthly callings to the ‘soli deo gloria’."

But for solutions to non-tariff barriers, or Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures(‘SPS’) and Technical Barriers to Trade(‘TBT’), however, the effect of the FTA could be considerably damaged. TheSPS part of the FTA consists of six Articles which include general rules similar to the ones in other FTAs concluded by Korean government. In addition, the FTA provides that the SPS Agreement of WTO shall apply between the Parties, except as otherwise provided for the Chapter of it. Though the target of the FTA is to eliminate trade barriers, domestic implementations of the Agreement possibly bring non-tariff barriers on the other Party.The article seeks for effective use of the FTA to ease the burdens of non-tariff barriers, based on a deep investigation into the SPS cases relating to the state practices by China. Chinese governments have experienced abundant of problems with food supply of harmful and dangerous products manufactured under its sovereignty. Suchcases as ‘melamine milk powder in China,’ ‘pesticide in Chinese buns in Japan,’ and ‘Japanese import restriction against Chinese spinach over tolerance limit’ are the import restriction fully based on scientific risk analysis. They falls into the legitimate measures protecting human life or health in the Parties’ territories. The experiences resulted from harmful product supplies are urging the Chinese government to tighten up the domestic regulations. Such practices of China, meanwhile, result in collateral effects, or the restriction of import from foreign territories.The article investigates, as Chinese non-tariff barrier cases, Korea Pasteurized Milk Case, Korea Kimchi Case, Korea Chicken Soup Case, and Korea Raw Rice Wine Case. The cases has the same dimension, or the SPS measures by China over the Korean products which failed to meet the Chinese standards. The implication is thatthe products have been being sold and bought in Korean market without any question.This implicates that some SPS measures may result in non-tariff barriers when a government applies them leaving the characters of a product and the SPS standards of other sovereignty out of consideration.The article suggests “How to make best use of the FTA” in a legal and political view, based on the thought that correspondence and persuasion in accordance with principles of law or legal norms are the most realistic and effective approaches to ease trade conflicts, and to secure benefits from the trade with China, one of the largestworld economies. It represents specific implementations of the Articles in the FTA upon the principle of transparency, equivalence, international standards, harmonization, technical cooperation, Korea-China Committee on the SPS Measures. The vital importance in SPS measures is whether they are based on scientific evidences. AState’s import restriction to protect human in its territory is a sovereign right recognized by international trade laws, if risks to human are clearly evidenced.Uncertain scientific legitimacy, however, causes concerns about international conflicts, because domestic implementation without scientific evidence can be non-tariff barriers.To prevent SPS measures by the Parties from being a cause of trade disputes, two countries need to share the standards of each other’s, and they also should learn and use the FTA articles at first."
간재(艮齋) 문하(門下) 용암(勇菴) 김사우(金思禹)의 학문(學問)과 사상(思想) ― 간재학의 계승과 극복의 `일리(一理)`적(的) 체용심성론(體用心性論)을 중심으로 ―,2016,"['의암勇菴)', '김사우(金思牛)', '이(理)', '간재(艮齋)', '화이론', 'Yongam', 'Kim Sa-u', '""Reasoning""', 'Ganjae']","勇菴 金思禹(1857-1907)는 지금까지 학계에 알려지지 않은 간재의 高足 弟子이다. 용암의 現實의 憂患意識 및 學者的 處世觀, 그리고 華夷論과 異端 批判 및 그 對應論은 대체로 스승 간재와 함께 보조를 취하여 계승하는 입장에 서고 있다. 특히 이단 배척에 있어, 용암은 당시 `心卽理`설을 주장하고 있는 한주학파와 心을 理로 주장하려는 즉 主心家들인 화서학파와 노사학파들의 설을 이단 학설로 규정하고 비판한다. 반면 正學은 스승 간재의 `心本性`학과 주자학과 율곡학을 대두시켜 계승 발전시킬 것을 맹서한다. 그런 반면 용암은 知覺, 知識, 三達德설을 비롯한 심성리설에 있어서는 스승 간재의 의견에 동의하지 않고 자득의 이론을 제안한다. 간재 역시 이들 문제에 대한 용암의 견해에 대해 심각한 병통의식으로 고민한다. 용암은 당시의 도술분열의 관건이 되고 있는 즉, 리기심성의 主從·師弟·尊卑의 관계성 논리의 대안으로 經緯·體用論을 제안한다. 존비와 주종관계는 優劣의 논리에 기인하고 있지만 체용논리는 그러한 우열의식을 다소 완화할 수 있기 때문이다. 요컨대 `一理字`上의 經緯·體用論을 제안한다. 이렇게 되면 華西의 `本心卽理`설의 理, 蘆沙의 `理尊無對`의 理, 寒洲의 `心卽理`의 理를 동시에 모두 어느 정도 섭용하는 가운데, 자파의 심본성설에도 크게 위배되지 않기 때문이다. 요컨대 주자 `性卽理`學의 근원지인 `一理`學으로 歸敬하여 대동적 사상 통일을 구현해 보자는 것이다. 그런 한편 용암은 자신의 자파인 간재학의 `性師心弟說`, `性尊心卑說`, `心本性說` 역시 당면한 시대와 현실에 부응하기에는 많은 한계와 어려움이 있다는 것을 직시하고 간재선생에게 합일점을 찾기를 충언한다. 그래서 그는 간재 선생과의 논의를 통해, 心의 중요도를 약화시키기 위해 誠의 중요도를 강조하는 가운데, `性體道用`論과 `達德(道之體)·達道(性之用)論 및 `誠本道用`論을 제시한다. 그러면서 선생이 삼덕이 心의 用이라는 주장에 대해, 용암은 주자의 해석에 근거하여 `三德卽性(理)之同`이라고 하여 理(性)學으로 귀결시키고자 하였다. 이와 같은 용암의 `理`一字上의 經緯·體用論的 理心性說의 展開는 30년간 스승 간재 師門에서 듣고 배운 과정을 통해 일생동안 參究하고 思索하며 考驗하는 것에서 自得한 것이다. 이러한 용암의 이기심성설의 자득론은 당시 일제 강점기 바로 직전의 심성설 논쟁으로 인한 학파 분열을 理學으로 통일 귀속시켜 제국주의의 침략과 일본의 침탈에 항거하는 지침 즉, 大一統의 大同的 民族主體 思想에 근간하고 있다는 것에서, 그 의의가 적지 않다고 할 수 있다. 우리는 여기서 당시 國亡의 克復을 위한 용암의 이와 같은 憂國衷情의 정신체계를 미래의 통일을 위한 指南處로 삼아야 하지 않을까 한다.","Yongam Kim Sa-u(1857∼1907) was the principal disciple of Ganjae who is not known to the academia to date. His Virtue Establishment and Deep Learning are evaluated as the pillar of the academia, and the cream of the Confucian scholars. Yongam`s concerning mind of the reality, his scholarly worldview, his criticism different from the Theory of the Civilized and Barbarians, and response theory generally keep abreast with his master Ganjae, and inherit them. Yet, in relation to his master Ganjae`s worldview, Yongam did not hesitate to present counsel and advice, and vowed to consolidate mutual ties among his scholarly colleagues to respond to the times and thoughts. Yongam was deeply concerned about the then problem of the Techniques of the Way being divided. The division of schools and political parties led to the division of the state`s public opinions and the weakening of the state power, eventually to the fall of the state due to external powers. Thus, Yongam asked his master Ganjae to unify thoughts. Yet, he developed his philosophy and reasoning and acquired this learning from 30 years of the studies with his master Ganjae, as well as from self-study, thinking and experience. Such self-acquisition theory of Yongam is based on the guideline under which, prior the Japanese colonial rule of Korea, the division of studies due to arguments about the Mind theory is unified into the reasoning studies so as to resist the imperial invasion and Japanese deprivation of Korea, making it significant. We should take Yongam`s patriotic mentality for overcoming the state`s difficulties as the guideline for our future unification of Korea."

The 3 participants of the study were selected from all 6 child-rearing prisoners in the female prison and face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted twice for each inmate so as to collect the details of their child-rearing experience through their story-telling processes. The researcher’s journal, an interview with a correctional officer in the female prison, and a picture drawn by a female prisoner were included in order to enrich the content of data. Findings are as follows: (1) Child-rearing female prisoners got to experience love in the child-raising process and extend this feeling of love for caring for others. (2) They felt dismayed by the adverse prison situation where appropriate child care such as diverse playing tools or toys and optimal learning stimulus for the child are not plausible — feeling “double punishment” due to the feeling of passing their own penalty to the child in the prison as well as the lack of care for the other child outside the prison. (3) Child-raising prisoners, however, felt and realized that the whole process and experience of staying with their child together inside the prison facility made them a real and true mother who could develop deep feelings of attachment to the child inside and outside of the prison and therefore a strong will to survive under any life circumstances. They realized that a true caring mother is always being together with sincere heart and listening to children with sincere heart. (4) Child-raising female prisoners felt the feelings of thanking and understanding others resulted from the situation only in the plight of limitation of everything for child-care that could have been possible if they had raised the child outside the prison. This study reveals what the experience of being a mother in the prison while raising a child is like and further suggests policy directions for the rehabilitation and education of female prisoners in general so that they could successfully be reintegrated into the society after release."

Though the three forms of performances are in unity because songs, dances, and musics are harmonious, the comprehensive academic study is not conducted so. It is because in the school of the modern times, songs, dances, and musics were taught and learned on the focus of respective majors, though they were taught and learned in a mix of style in the ancient times when they were transferred and received mouse to heart. As a result, in an affirmative aspect the number of majors increase, but on the other hand, the ability decreases gradually, to perform songs, dances, and musics in a mix of style, however they are formed in a deep style. For the purpose of disclosing the contrarieties, this study at first examined reading method of 'gagokbo(歌曲譜, song score)'. Though educators teach and singers songs musics by the score named 'jeongganbo(井間譜), it is insufficient. Teaching and learning can be accomplished by analyzing ""16 jeong 6 daegangbo(十六井六大綱譜)"" stated at ｢the preface｣ of ""Sejosillokakbo(世祖實錄樂譜)"" (King Sejo Chronicles Score)"" In reality, Sejosillokakbo(世祖實錄樂譜) is composed of '16 jeong 6 daegangbo(十六井六大綱譜)'. It is necessary, by analyzing the records and scores appearing at dances (=jeongjae, 呈才), to examine how '16 jeong 6 daegangbo(十六井六大綱譜)' is applied . It is because they are included at song accompaniments expressed by mouses and dance accompaniments expressed by bodies. This study analyzed 'maehwajeomjangdan and janggojangdan(梅花點長 短과 杖鼓長短)' to examine '16 jeong 6 daegangbo(十六井六大綱譜)', and knew that the songs of 'sakdaeyeop(數大葉)' included in 16 jeong 6 daegang(十六井六大綱) and the songs of 'pyeon(編)' included in 10 jeong 6 daehang(十井六大綱)' were applied to 6 daegang(六大綱) the same. Only the number of jeonggan(井間) had difference in 16 jeong(十六井) and 10 jeong(十井), and the songs of 'pyeon(編)' were faster than the songs of sakdaeyeop(數大葉). It means that they express the speed of respective musics. In addition, 16jeong 6daegang(十六井六大綱) is divided into two. 'Gak of the first half(前半刻) =1,2,3 daegang(大綱), and gak of the second half(後半刻)=4,5,6 daegang(大綱). In the course, the form and the content of 'the beat of maehwajeom and the beat of Janggo(梅花點 長短과 杖鼓長短)' were defined as those of 16 jeong and 6 daegang(十六 井六大綱). On the basis of them, this study selected and analyzed objectively two samples, one music 'sakdaeyeop(數大葉)' and one music 'Jangjinju(將進酒)'. In addition, this study applied the analysis to ""dance (=jeongjae, 呈才) changsabo(唱詞譜)"". As a result, this study could verify the unity because it was possible to extract the dispersion of ""16 jeong 6 daegang(十六井六大綱)"" applied to 'songs, dances, and musics'."
‘환경에 대한 성찰’을 주제로 한 대학 글쓰기교육 사례연구,2016,"['레이첼 카슨', '침묵의 봄', '환경', '글쓰기', '생태교육', 'Rachel Carson', 'Silent Spring', 'Environment', 'Writing', 'Ecological Education']","본 연구는 ‘환경에 대한 성찰’을 주제로 한 대학 글쓰기 수업 사례를 통해 학생들의 생태문제에 대한 인식을 제고하고 사고와 표현능력을 함양하는데 있어 교육적 효과가 있음을 분석하였다. 환경운동의 고전인 레이첼 카슨의『침묵의 봄』을 읽고 자신의 생각을 글로 쓰는 과정에서, 학생들의 관심을 이끌어내고 글의 콘텐츠를 강화할 수 있도록 다양한 텍스트를 어떻게 해석하고 접근했는지를 중심으로 논의를 전개하였다. 본 연구 결과가 환경교육과 글쓰기 교육에 시사하는 함의는 다음과 같다.  첫째, 대학 글쓰기 수업은 관심 주제를 설정하여 독립적인 읽기-쓰기 모듈을 구성하여 운영할 필요가 있다. 텍스트를 읽고 생각을 나누고 글로 써보고 피드백을 받는 과정이 하나의 모듈 속에서 순환되고 반복적으로 진행되는 것이 중요하다. 둘째, 학생들의 사고력과 표현력을 키워주기 위해서는 교육과정을 통해 글쓰기 주제와 관련하여 다양한 텍스트들을 융합시키는 것이다. ‘환경’을 주제로 한 3주 모듈의 경우 이 분야의 고전인 『침묵의 봄』을 통해 저자의 문제의식과 만나고, 해당 주제를 탐색할 수 있도록 시, 만화, 노래, 동영상 자료 등 다양한 텍스트를 접목함으로써 학생들이 생각을 확장해 가도록 자극하였다. 셋째 생태교육이나 환경교육을 기획하고 진행할 때 글쓰기 과정을 포함하는 것이 효과적이라는 점이다. 글쓰기는 숙고와 성찰의 기회를 제공한다는 점에서 학생들이 환경에 대해 보다 심도 있는 문제의식을 갖고 일상에서 실천하는 태도를 이끌어내는데 중요한 기회를 제공한다는 것이다.  본 연구를 통해 학생들이 글을 쓰는 과정에서 생태학적 고민과 환경에 대한 문제의식이 심화되고 있음을 발견할 수 있었다. ‘환경’을 주제로 한 대학 글쓰기교육을 다룬 본 사례연구가 향후 생태교육을 하는데 기초적인 자료로써 활용되고, 또한 글쓰기 수업에서 환경을 주제로 하는 읽기-쓰기 교육모듈을 구성하는데 유용성을 갖길 기대한다. 미래 세대를 위한 교육과정에서 환경과 생태교육은 비중 있게 다루어져야 하는 시대가 되고 있다. 그런 점에서 학생들이 글쓰기를 배우면서 자연스럽게 생태주의에 눈 뜨는 계기를 제공했다는 점에서 ‘환경’을 주제로 한 대학글쓰기 교육은 의미가 있었다.","This research paper analyzed educational effects of the writing education in enhancing students’ consciousness on ecological problems and in cultivating their writing abilities through class case studies, which has a subject of introspection on the environment, showing how they utilized related texts in doing so. During the process of reading Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, a classic book of environmental movement, and writing their thinking, discussions have focused on how students interpret and approach the texts, aiming to derive their interests and to strengthen the contents. The implications of this research on environment education and writing education are as follows.  First, university’s writing class needs to be operated in configuring independent reading and writing module, setting up interesting topics. Circulation and repetition of the procedures of book reading, idea sharing, writing, and a feedback in a module is important. Second, concerning writing topics, throughout the educational process, various texts need be conflated to cultivate students’ thinking and expressing ability. In the three weeks’ module with the topic of “Environment”, students could recognize author’s critical mind through the classic book “Silent Spring”, and were motivated to expand their scope of thinking to search the subject, connected with various texts like poem, cartoons, music, and video clips. Third, including writing process in organizing and executing ecological education and/or environmental education is effective. In terms of offering the chances of introspection and contemplation to students, the writing offers important opportunities in deriving their manners of practice on the environment with their deep critical minds on it.  This research could find students’ ecological concerns and critical minds on the environment are intensified during the process of writing. I hope this case study which is handling university’s writing education, with a subject of “environment”, can be utilized for ecological education as a basic material, and I also expect the effectiveness of this study in reconfiguring the educational module of reading and writing during the class activities which handles environmental topics. The era has been coming when ecological education should be handled importantly during the educational process for future generation. In that point, university’s writing education with a subject of environment is meaningful in making chances that students naturally recognize ecology as they learn the writing."

It is essential for writers to have a will to revise and a habit of revising their writing repeatedly to complete draft and finally make a good piece of writing. With limitations on environment in the current university writing, however, most of correction education provided by instructors ends up with simply one-off instruction, which has a little impact on learning of revision. Learners’s positive attitude toward revision of writing is a prerequisite for repeated revision which should be done in writing. This research has proposed a model of the process of correction education, ‘intuitive evaluation → analytic evaluation → self-evaluation,’ as one of ways to let learners have a habit of revising their writing based on positive motivation for revision, and enhance their self-evaluation ability. The results of the application of the model on leaners are as follows. First, in the first step, the intuitive evaluation, learners were asked to write an impression on their peer’s writing by relying on their ‘intuition.’ Intuition requires concentration, caution and endeavor since it is part of conscious empathic action by getting into deep inside of the target and accord with it. Therefore, the learners were guided to appreciate the peer’s writing and express their thoughts on that by concentrating and sticking with the contents as much as they could. On request of the instructors that leaners should frankly express their opinions on the peer’s depending on not analytic but intuitive thoughts, many leaners expressed many positive views. Second, when it comes to the analytic evaluation, the learners were requested to logically point out the emotional contents done through the intuition evaluation, and lead it to a scientific evaluation. For this process, the instructors suggested items for correction, and had the leaners to find out reasons for their intuitive evaluation on the peer’s within the text and provide its logical basis. The analytic evaluation based on given criteria has helped the subjects carrying out correction to be involved in a detailed evaluation by exploring the text itself more precisely than they do during the intuitive evaluation to discover reasons for the items presented. Third, during the self-evaluation process, the leaners were asked to review their own writing objectively by referring to intuitive appreciation and analytic evaluation of the peers. The learners came to diagnose problems of their writing relatively smoothly because they already practiced correction from expressing their intuitive opinions on the peer’s and applying it to the analytic evaluation. It can be translated that the process of exchanging reactions on the evaluation between peers has helped the learners recognize readers, and internalize the evaluation guide for good writing to a certain extent through learning of correction twice. It can be better to revise writing multiple times since revision is derived from writers’ awareness of readers and the responsibility for own writing. During the correction education, it can be considered that the role of an instructor to make learners have a habit of revising their writing repeatedly is to help them have a positive thought on revision and raise their ability for self-revision. Lastly, it is expected that the self-revision model processed through the intuitive appreciation and analytic evaluation provided by peers proposed on this study can be one way of useful correction education for enhancing university students’ motivation and ability for revision."
중국 위생검역분야 비관세장벽 완화를 위한 한 - 중 FTA 이행방안,2016,"['Korea-China FTA', 'Sanitary and Phytosanitary(SPS) Measures', 'Non-tariff Barriers', 'transparency', 'equivalence', 'harmonization', 'SPS Committee.', '한-중 FTA', '위생검역조치', '비관세장벽', '투명성', '동등성', '조화', '위생검역위원회']","한-중 FTA의 타결은 우리나라의 농수산품 관련 산업의 대중국 진출을 위한 전환점이 될 것으로 기대되지만, 위생검역(SPS) 및 기술무역장벽(TBT)으로 대변되는 비관세장벽이 해소되지 않는다면 그 효과는 반감될 것이다. 총 6개의 조문으로 구성된 한-중 FTA 위생검역분야는 우리나라가 체결한 다른 FTA처럼 일반적인 규정과 함께, 한-중 FTA에 달리 규정이 없는 경우에는 WTO SPS 협정을 따르도록 하고 있다. 한-중 FTA의 기본 목적은 무역장벽의 해소이지만, 문제는 국내이행과정에서 비관세장벽의 모습이 나타난다는 점이다.본 논문에서는 중국과 관련한 다양한 위생검역조치 관련 사례들의 분석을 토대로 비관세 장벽의 완화를 위한 한-중 FTA 활용 방안을 모색하였다. 중국은 그동안 유해한 자국제품의 유통으로 인한 문제점을 경험하였다. 중국 내에서 발생한 멜라닌 분유 유통 사례, 중국 농약만두 일본 유통 사례, 허용기준치를 초과한 중국산 시금치에 대한 일본의 수입규제 사례 등에서처럼 과학적 정당성이 입증된 수입규제는 자국민의 생명 및 건강을 보호하기 위한 정당한 법적조치에 해당한다. 중국도 유해한 제품들의 유통으로 인한 인적피해를 겪은 후에는 자국의 관련 법규를 개선·강화하고 있다. 하지만, 중국의 자국 내 위생기준의 강화와 위생검역조치 이행규정의 엄격한 적용으로 인해 타국 제품의 수입을 규제하는 효과가 나타나고 있다. 본 논문에서는 중국의 비관세장벽 운영사례로써 한국산 살균유 수입규제 사례, 한국산 김치수입규제 사례, 한국산 삼계탕 검역규제 사례, 한국산 막걸리 수입 규제 사례를 검토하였다. 이들 사례들은 공통적으로 중국의 위생검역기준에 부합하지 않는 한국산 제품에 대한 검역규제였다. 문제는 이러한 제품들이 한국 내에서는 아무런 문제없이 유통이 이루어지고 있는 제품이라는 점이다. 제품의 특성을 고려하지 않은, 그리고 타국의 위생기준 및 위생검역을 고려하지 않은 위생검역규제들은 비관세무역장벽으로 작동하게 되는 것이다.본 논문에서는 위생검역분야에서 무역강국인 중국과의 통상마찰을 해소하고, 우리의 통상이익을 확보하기 위한 가장 현실적이고 효율적인 수단은 법원칙 또는 법규범에 입각한 대응과 설득이라는 시각에서 한-중 FTA의 활용방안을 법·정책적 측면에서 제시하였다. 한-중 FTA에서 규정하고 있는 투명성 원칙, 동등성, 국제표준 및 조화, 기술협력, 한-중 FTA SPS 위원회 관련 조항들의 구체적인 이행방안을 세부적으로 제시하였다. 위생검역 분야에서 무엇보다 중요한 것은 과학적 정당성에 기반한 정책인가이다. 위해성이 명확하게 입증되는 경우 자국민의 보호를 위한 수입규제 조치는 국제통상규범상 당연한 주권국가의 권리이다. 그러나 과학적 정당성이 불확실한 경우에는 국가별로 상이한 자국의 이행규범을 적용하게 될 때, 이러한 규범은 무역장벽이 되어 국가간 통상분쟁을 야기하게 된다. 한-중 양국이 위생검역분야에서 통상분쟁을 예방하기 위한 일차적인 방법은 양국의 기준에 대한 이해와 공유가 될 것이며, 이를 위한 출발점이 한-중 FTA에 조항에 대한 정확한 이해와 활용이 될 것이다.","The conclusion of Korea-China FTA is considered as a watershed in advancing, especially in the Korea agro-fishery industry to China. But for solutions to non-tariff barriers, or Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures(‘SPS’) and Technical Barriers to Trade(‘TBT’), however, the effect of the FTA could be considerably damaged. The SPS part of the FTA consists of six Articles which include general rules similar to the ones in other FTAs concluded by Korean government. In addition, the FTA provides that the SPS Agreement of WTO shall apply between the Parties, except as otherwise provided for the Chapter of it. Though the target of the FTA is to eliminate trade barriers, domestic implementations of the Agreement possibly bring non-tariff barriers on the other Party.The article seeks for effective use of the FTA to ease the burdens of non-tariff barriers, based on a deep investigation into the SPS cases relating to the state practices by China. Chinese governments have experienced abundant of problems with food supply of harmful and dangerous products manufactured under its sovereignty. Such cases as ‘melamine milk powder in China,’ ‘pesticide in Chinese buns in Japan,’ and ‘Japanese import restriction against Chinese spinach over tolerance limit’ are the import restriction fully based on scientific risk analysis. They falls into the legitimate measures protecting human life or health in the Parties’ territories. The experiences resulted from harmful product supplies are urging the Chinese government to tighten up the domestic regulations. Such practices of China, meanwhile, result in collateral effects, or the restriction of import from foreign territories.The article investigates, as Chinese non-tariff barrier cases,  Korea Pasteurized Milk Case, Korea Kimchi Case, Korea Chicken Soup Case, and Korea Raw Rice Wine Case. The cases has the same dimension, or the SPS measures by China over the Korean products which failed to meet the Chinese standards. The implication is that the products have been being sold and bought in Korean market without any question. This implicates that some SPS measures may result in non-tariff barriers when a government applies them leaving the characters of a product and the SPS standards of other sovereignty out of consideration.The article suggests “How to make best use of the FTA” in a legal and political view, based on the thought that correspondence and persuasion in accordance with principles of law or legal norms are the most realistic and effective approaches to ease trade conflicts, and to secure benefits from the trade with China, one of the largest world economies. It represents specific implementations of the Articles in the FTA upon the principle of transparency, equivalence, international standards, harmonization, technical cooperation, Korea-China Committee on the SPS Measures. The vital importance in SPS measures is whether they are based on scientific evidences. A State’s import restriction to protect human in its territory is a sovereign right recognized by international trade laws, if risks to human are clearly evidenced. Uncertain scientific legitimacy, however, causes concerns about international conflicts, because domestic implementation without scientific evidence can be non-tariff barriers. To prevent SPS measures by the Parties from being a cause of trade disputes, two countries need to share the standards of each other’s, and they also should learn and use the FTA articles at first."
