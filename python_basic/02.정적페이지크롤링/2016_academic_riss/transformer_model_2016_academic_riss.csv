An Efficient Model to Calculate Axial Natural Vibration Frequency of Power Transformer Winding,2016,"['power transformer', 'winding', 'efficient finite element model', 'axial natural vibration frequency']",,"In the design of transformer winding, natural vibration frequency is an important parameter. This paper presents a 2D model to calculate axial vibration natural frequency of power transformer winding based on the elastic dynamics theory, and according to the elastic support equivalent principle of radial pressboards. The 3D model to calculate natural vibration frequency can be simplified as a 2D one as the support of pressboards on the winding is same. It is verified that results of the 2D model are consistent with those of 3D one, but the former can achieve much higher calculation efficiency. It shows that increasing the width and number of pressboards can improve axial natural frequency through formula analysis and simulation, and also the relations between the changes of axial pre-compression and axial natural vibration frequency on the windings are investigated. Finally, the proposed 2D model’s effectiveness is proved when compared with tested ones."
Modelling and study on the output flow characteristics of expansion energy used hydropneumatic transformer,2016,"['Hydropneumatic transformer', 'Output flow', 'Modeling simulation', 'Experimental study']",,"Hydropneumatic transformer (short for HP transformer) is used to pump pressurized hydraulic oil. Whereas, due to its insufficient usage of energy and low efficiency, a new kind of HP transformer: EEUHP transformer (Expansion energy used hydropneumatic transformer) was proposed. To illustrate the characteristics of the EEUHP transformer, a mathematical model was built. To verify the mathematical model, an experimental prototype was setup and studied. Through simulation and experimental study on the EEUHP transformer, the influence of five key parameters on the output flow of the EEUHP transformer were obtained, and some conclusions can be drawn.Firstly, the mathematical model was proved to be valid. Furthermore, the EEUHP transformer costs fewer of compressed air than the normal HP transformer when the output flow of the two kinds of transformers are almost same. Moreover, with an increase in the output pressure, the output flow decreases sharply. Finally, with an increase in the effective area of hydraulic output port, the output flow increases distinctly. This research can be referred to in the performance and design optimization of the EEUHP transformers."
An Efficient Algorithm for the Tensor Product Model Transformation,2016,"['HOSVD', 'LPV models', 'polytopic models', 'TP model transformation', 'uniform design.']",,"The tensor-product (TP) model transformation was proposed recently as a numerical and automaticallyexecutable method which is capable of transforming linear parameter varying (LPV) state-space models into thehigher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) based canonical form of polytopic models. The crucial disadvantageof the TP model transformation is that its computational load explodes with the density of discretization andthe dimensionality of the parameter vector of the parameter-varying state-space model. In this paper we propose anew algorithm that leads to considerable reduction of the computation in the TP model transformation. The mainidea behind the modified algorithm is to minimize the number of discretized points to acquire as much informationas possible. The modified TP model transformation can readily be executed on a regular computer efficiently andconcisely, especially in higher dimensional cases when the original TP model transformation fails. The paper alsopresents numerical examples to show the effectiveness of the new algorithm."
Extraction of digital elevation model using stereo matching with slope-adaptive patch transformation,2016,[],,"<P>Traditional automated DEM generation from high-resolution satellite imagery relies on area-based correlation matching methods. However, these methods often fail, especially where the slope of the terrain is very high; this results in large geometric difference in the stereo pair. To address this issue, we introduced an adaptive stereo matching scheme that incorporates image transformation for the slope in the epipolar image space. The matching patch is designed to adaptively transform the target image according to the terrain slope determined in the lower scale of the image pyramid. This transformation reduces the geometric difference between the stereoscopic images due to the image acquisition angle and the terrain slope. Experimental results with Kompsat-2 images showed that the proposed method increased the overall matching success rate by 5% and the vertical accuracy of the generated DEM improved by about 2 meters (17%).</P>"
Different anti-remodeling effect of nilotinib and fluticasone in a chronic asthma model,2016,"['Asthm', 'Nilotinib', 'Fluticasone', 'Airway remodeling']",,"Background/Aims: Inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective treatment currently available for asthma, but their beneficial effect against airway remodeling is limited. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib has inhibitory activity against c-kit and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. We compared the effects of fluticasone and nilotinib on airway remodeling in a chronic asthma model. We also examined whether co-treatment with nilotinib and fluticasone had any synergistic effect in preventing airway remodeling. Methods: We developed a mouse model of airway remodeling, including smooth muscle thickening, in which ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized female BALB/c-mice were repeatedly exposed to intranasal OVA administration twice per week for 3 months. Mice were treated with fluticasone and/or nilotinib intranasally during the OVA challenge. Results: Mice chronically exposed to OVA developed eosinophilic airway inflammation and showed features of airway remodeling, including thickening of the peribronchial smooth muscle layer. Both f luticasone and nilotinib attenuated airway smooth muscle thickening. However, only nilotinib suppressed fibrotic changes, demonstrating inhibition of collagen deposition. Fluticasone reduced pro-inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, and several cytokines, such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13, induced by repeated OVA challenges. On the other hand, nilotinib reduced transforming growth factor β1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and inhibited fibroblast proliferation significantly. Conclusions: These results suggest that fluticasone and nilotinib suppressed airway remodeling in this chronic asthma model through anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic pathways, respectively."
Effective Dimensionality Reduction of Payload-Based Anomaly Detection in TMAD Model for HTTP Payload,2016,"['Principle Component Analysis', 'Intrusion Detection System', 'Dimensionality Reduction', 'Feature Selection', 'Packet Payload']",,"Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in general considers a big amount of data that are highly redundant and irrelevant. This trait causes slow instruction, assessment procedures, high resource consumption and poor detection rate. Due to their expensive computational requirements during both training and detection, IDSs are mostly ineffective for real-time anomaly detection. This paper proposes a dimensionality reduction technique that is able to enhance the performance of IDSs up to constant time O(1) based on the Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Furthermore, the present study offers a feature selection approach for identifying major components in real time. The PCA algorithm transforms high-dimensional feature vectors into a low-dimensional feature space, which is used to determine the optimum volume of factors. The proposed approach was assessed using HTTP packet payload of ISCX 2012 IDS and DARPA 1999 dataset. The experimental outcome demonstrated that our proposed anomaly detection achieved promising results with 97% detection rate with 1.2% false positive rate for ISCX 2012 dataset and 100% detection rate with 0.06% false positive rate for DARPA 1999 dataset. Our proposed anomaly detection also achieved comparable performance in terms of computational complexity when compared to three state-of-the-art anomaly detection systems."

For the generation of test cases, scenarios need to be found for representing as a sequence diagram, and to extract test paths satisfying the test coverage. However, it is hard to automatically extract test paths from the sequence diagram because a sequence diagram represents loop, opt, and alt information using CombinedFragments. To resolve this problem, we propose a transformation process that transforms a sequence diagram into an activity diagram which represents scenarios as a type of control flows. In addition, we generate test cases from the activity diagram by applying a test coverage concept. Finally, we present a case study for test cases generation from a sequence diagram."
A model-based approach for integration analysis of well log and seismic data for reservoir characterization,2016,"['3-D seismic volume', 'seismic-well tie', 'probabilistic neural network', 'seismic inversion', 'reservoir characterization']",,"Accurate reservoir model requires complete information of subsurface properties, specifically porosity and permeability.Reservoir heterogeneity is the fundamental challenge for geoscientists to predict these properties which may affect the reservoir performance and their well productivity. Porosity is one of the key parameters for accumulation of hydrocarbon but its prediction is difficult due to significant variation over a reservoir volume.A spatial distribution of porosity can be investigated by integrating the 3-D seismic and well log attributes which may help in determining such reservoir variation. In addition, nonlinear multivariable regression techniques such as multivariable transform, Genetic algorithm, and Probabilistic Neural Network analysis have also been implemented to achieve high correlation coefficients between well log properties and seismic data. Results from nonlinear regression have better correlations than linear regression. In this study, a 3-D low frequency model (LFM) is proposed which can be estimated by kriging interpolation of resultant impedance values from well log data. Furthermore, “seismic inversion” is adopted for extracting correlated attributes to merge with the LFM so as to better construct a pseudo log volume.A polynomial neural network (PNN*1) is utilized to convert resultant acoustic impedance values into a distinct reservoir property such as porosity. PNN* is trained, tested and validated by using gammaray and resultant acoustic impedance values as input and effective porosity values as a target. The trained PNN* is then applied over the whole reservoir volume to generate a pseudo log volume. In the proposed low frequency model, an attempt has been made to achieve high correlation between the predicted and measured porosity logs.It will improve the reservoir characterization and lead to better estimation of hydrocarbon reserves. This low frequency model achieves better correlation between the predicted and true porosity log even with a minimum number of measured well logs."
A Fast Analytic Model of Axial Flux Permanent Magnet Machines with Static/Dynamic Axis Eccentricity,2016,"['analytical model', 'axial flux PM machines', 'back EMFs', 'eccentricities']",,"This paper presents a general analytical model to calculate the characteristics of axial-flux permanent-magnet machines with axis eccentricities. The radial and tangential magnetic flux densities in the air gap under normal conditions were first obtained using a combination of Maxwell’s equations and Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) transformation. Next, equations for the radii were deduced to investigate the static/dynamic eccentricities. The back electromotive forces (EMFs) were calculated and compared with those obtained from finite element (FE) analysis. The analytical predictions show good agreement with the FE results. Detection approaches were obtained by comparing with normal conditions, and the analytical model was verified experimentally."
A pressure-transient model for a fractured-vuggy carbonate reservoir with large-scale cave,2016,"['Fractured-vuggy carbonate reservoir', 'large-scale cave', 'pressure-transient', 'boundary element method']",,"In the development process of fractured-vuggy carbonate reservoir with large-scale caves, the location and size of cave affect the development program. This paper takes the large-scale cave as equipotential body, treats matrix and fracture as double porous media, and establishes the flow model. Laplace transform is used to simplify the model, and then the model is solved using boundary element method. Considering the wellbore storage effect and skin effect, the bottomhole pressure-transient curve is obtained using Stefest numerical inversion method. Comparing the results of analytical solution and boundary element method in the dual porosity medium illustrate the accuracy of this model. The sensitivity of cave parameters is analyzed. It shows that the larger the cave radius is, the stronger the convex and concave of curve is. The convex is earlier and concave is sooner when cave is closer to the well. The segment of convex keeps longer and the concave margin is greater with the larger compressibility ratio. Finally, as an application example, actual test data from a large-scale cave reservoir is analyzed using this model, and the location and size of cave are obtained. It has a certain significance for the reserve evaluation and well test in this reservoir."
Potential for Emulating Developmental States Model Using SNS in Africa,2016,"['Developmental States Model', 'East Asia', 'Africa', 'SNS']",,"In the postwar period, the countries around the world experienced political, economic and social transformation, shaping or adapting different political economic models. On the one side of the world, East Asian developmental states, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, shaped developmental states model, experiencing miraculous economic development though strategic state intervention. African states on the other hand adapted neoliberal economy, which turned out to be a failure, resulting economic backwardation. In this paper, we propose that African states should follow the footsteps of East Asian developmental sates model in order to achieve social, political stability and economic development. For the study, secondary data from international organization has been used, and theories of international political economy is outlined to test the credibility. Although African states face structural problem on the key actors of developmental states model, social, political and economic structure, they can overcome these issue with the effective use of social network service (SNS)."
Synthesis of nanostructured adsorbent and dye adsorption modeling by an intelligent model for multicomponent systems,2016,"['Nanostructured Adsorbent', 'Synthesis', 'Intelligent Modeling', 'Binary System', 'Dye Adsorption', 'Wastewater']",,"β-Ni(OH)2 nanoparticle was synthesized and used as an adsorbent. The prepared adsorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Least square support vector machine (LSSVM) as an intelligent model was applied for modeling of dye removal based on experimental data obtained from laboratory. The nanostructured adsorbent was used to remove three cationic dyes (BB41: Basic blue 41, BR18: Basic Red 18 and BR46: Basic Red 46) from single and binary systems at room temperature. The kinetics and isotherm of dye adsorption was studied.The effects of adsorbent dosage and initial dye concentration were elucidated. The kinetic studies showed that the adsorption data followed pseudo-second order kinetics model. The isotherm analysis indicates that the adsorption data can be represented by Langmuir in single systems. Based on graphical plots and the values of statistical parameter, LSSVM as an intelligent model is suitable for modeling of dye adsorption from single and binary systems."

Effects of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Erectile Dysfunction in a Rat Model of Atherosclerosis-induced Chronic Pelvic Ischemia,2016,"['Erectile Dysfunction', 'Fatty Acids', 'Omega-3', 'Ischemia', 'Rats']",,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether the omega-3 fatty acids help to improve erectile function in an atherosclerosis-induced erectile dysfunction rat model. A total of 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats at age 8 weeks were divided into three groups: Control group (n = 6, untreated sham operated rats), Pathologic group (n = 7, untreated rats with chronic pelvic ischemia [CPI]), and Treatment group (n = 7, CPI rats treated with omega-3 fatty acids). For the in vivo study, electrical stimulation of the cavernosal nerve was performed and erectile function was measured in all groups. Immunohistochemical antibody staining was performed for transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α). In vivo measurement of erectile function in the Pathologic group showed significantly lower values than those in the Control group, whereas the Treatment group showed significantly improved values in comparison with those in the Pathologic group. The results of western blot analysis revealed that systemically administered omega-3 fatty acids ameliorated the cavernosal molecular environment. Our study suggests that omega-3 fatty acids improve intracavernosal pressure and have a beneficial role against pathophysiological consequences such as fibrosis or hypoxic damage on a CPI rat model, which represents a structural erectile dysfunction model."

Barrier Lyapunov function-based model-free constraint position control for mechanical systems,2016,"['Transformed tracking error', 'Constraint control', 'Adaptive laws', 'Barrier Lyapunov function', 'XY table', 'Robot manipulator']",,"In this article, a motion constraint control scheme is presented for mechanical systems without a modeling process by introducing a barrier Lyapunov function technique and adaptive estimation laws. The transformed error and filtered error surfaces are defined to constrain the motion tracking error in the prescribed boundary layers. Unknown parameters of mechanical systems are estimated using adaptive laws derived from the Lyapunov function. Then, robust control used the conventional sliding mode control, which give rise to excessive chattering, is changed to finite time-based control to alleviate undesirable chattering in the control action and to ensure finite-time error convergence. Finally, the constraint controller from the barrier Lyapunov function is designed and applied to the constraint of the position tracking error of the mechanical system. Two experimental examples for the XY table and articulated manipulator are shown to evaluate the proposed control scheme."

Methods: The scapula of a cow was purchased from a local grocery, and discs (diameter 8 mm, thickness 1 mm) were prepared by trephine bur. Discs treated with 4HR were used as the experimental group. Untreated discs were used as the control. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), antibacterial test, endotoxin test, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed on the discs. In vivo degradation was evaluated by the rat calvarial defect model. Results: The XRD and FT-IR results demonstrated successful incorporation of 4HR into the bovine bone.

In the SEM exam, the surface of the experimental group showed needle-shaped crystal and spreading of RAW264.7 cells. In the animal experiments, the amount of residual graft was significantly smaller in the experimental group compared to the control group (P = 0.003). Conclusions: In this study, 4HR was successfully incorporated into bovine bone, and 4HR-incorporated bovine bone had antibacterial properties.

Model Predictive Control for Shunt Active Power Filter in Synchronous Reference Frame,2016,"['Active power filter', 'Model predictive control', 'Synchronous reference frame Harmonic compensation', 'dSPACE controller']",,"This paper presents a model predictive control for shunt active power filters in synchronous reference frame using space vector pulse-width modulation (SVPWM).

Laplace transform ordering of time to failure in age replacement models,2016,"['Laplace transform', 'Age replacement models', 'Time to failure', 'Hazard rate', 'Preservation', 'Shock model', 'Life testing']",,"The concept of mean time to failure in age replacement models plays an important role in reliability and life testing. In this paper, based on the comparison of Laplace transform of time to failure in an age replacement model, we introduce and study a new stochastic order. This new order is stronger than the Laplace transform and the mean time to failure in the age replacement model orders. Some motivations and descriptions of the proposed stochastic order are provided. In addition, several characterizations and preservation properties of the new order under some well-known reliability operations are discussed.As a consequence, a new class of life distributions is proposed, and some of its reliability properties are investigated. Finally, the problem of testing exponentiality against such class is discussed and some numerical results are presented."
A Three-phase Hybrid Power Flow Algorithm for Meshed Distribution System with Transformer Branches and PV Nodes,2016,"['Distribution transformer', 'Meshed distribution system', 'Node-branch incidence matrix', 'Power flow', 'PV nodes']",,"Aiming at analyzing the power flow of the distribution systems with distribution transformer (DT) branches and PV nodes, a hybrid three-phase power flow methodology is presented in this paper. The incidence formulas among node voltages, loop currents and node current injections have been developed based on node-branch incidence matrix of the distribution network. The method can solve the power flow directly and has higher efficiency. Moreover, the paper provides a modified method to model DT branches by considering winding connections, phase shifting and off-nominal tap ratio, and then DT branches could be seen like one transmission line with the proposed power flow method. To deal with the PV nodes, an improved approach to calculate reactive power increment at each PV node was deduced based on the assumption that the positive-sequence voltage magnitude of PV node is fixed at a given value. Then during calculating the power flow at each iteration, it only needs to update current injection at each PV node with the proposed algorithm. The process is very simple and clear. The results of IEEE 4 nodes and the modified IEEE 34 nodes test feeders verified the correctness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid power flow algorithm."

A Probability Model for Discretionary Lane Changes in Highways,2016,"['discretionary lane changes', 'velocity and spacing advanctages', 'next generation simulation', 'exponential probability model', 'microscopic traffic simulation']",,"Lane changes are made frequently on the road and are therefore an important component in analyzing traffic situations. This behavior interferes with surrounding traffic, causes negative shockwaves, and may even lead to collisions. Lane changes can be categorized into mandatory lane changes and discretionary lane changes. There are various factors influencing the decision-making involved in discretionary lane changes, including relative velocity between target and original lane, and lead and lag gaps. The purpose of this paper is to present a stochastic approach for modeling discretionary lane changes with influential factors of velocity and spacing advantages. Using Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data, we proposed an exponential probability model with speed difference and lead gap difference between the target lane and the original lane. By transformed linear regression, these traffic variables have actual influences on the lane change probability of discretionary lane changes. The found results can be used for lane change models in microscopic traffic simulation."

A High-efficiency Method to Suppress Transformer Core Imbalance in Digitally Controlled Phase-shifted Full-bridge Converter,2016,"['Approximately digital control', 'Output rectifier', 'Transformer core imbalance', 'Voltage sensor']",,"A high-efficiency method is proposed to suppress magnetic core imbalance in phase-shifted full-bridge (PSFB) converters.

A time domain model of the secondary side is built to analyze the relationship between transformer core imbalance and cathode voltage of secondary side rectifiers. An approximate control algorithm is designed to achieve asymmetric phase control, which reduces the effects of imbalance. A 60 V/15 A prototype is built to verify the proposed method. Experimental results show that the numerical difference of primary side peak currents between two adjacent cycles is suppressed from 2 A to approximately 0 A. Meanwhile, compared with the PCM solution, the efficiency of the PSFB converter is slightly improved from 93% to 93.2%."
Energy efficiency in Korea: analysis using a hybrid DEA model,2016,"['Decomposition', 'energy consumption', 'energy efficiency', 'hybrid model', 'Korea']",,"Given the increasing importance of energy efficiency, we appraise the situation in Korea by analyzing past energy consumption patterns. By using a modified hybrid model of index decomposition analysis, artificial neural network (ANN), and data envelopment analysis (DEA), we predict the optimal energy consumption and estimate the difference between the optimal and real values. We decompose primary energy consumption considering the energy loss in a transformation, correcting the over-fitting problem in ANN, and addressing the negative value issue in DEA. We find that energy consumption was the most efficient between 1993 and 1994, 1994 and 1995, 1997 and 1998, and 1999 and 2000. If the over-fitting and negative value problems are properly controlled, the presented LMDI-ANN-DEA hybrid model can be used to predict energy efficiency. The results of this study would be useful to analyze energy consumption patterns in the benchmark years of Korea and help the government formulate a suitable energy policy."

S-adenosylmethionine reduces airway inflammation and fibrosis in a murine model of chronic severe asthma via suppression of oxidative stress,2016,[],,"Increased oxidative stress has an important role in asthmatic airway inflammation and remodeling. A potent methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), is known to protect against tissue injury and fibrosis through modulation of oxidative stress.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of SAMe on airway inflammation and remodeling in a murine model of chronic asthma. A mouse model was generated by repeated intranasal challenge with ovalbumin and Aspergillus fungal protease twice a week for 8 weeks. SAMe was orally administered every 24 h for 8 weeks. We performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis and histopathological examination. The levels of various cytokines and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) were measured in the lung tissue. Cultured macrophages and fibroblasts were employed to evaluate the underlying anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic mechanisms of SAMe. The magnitude of airway inflammation and fibrosis, as well as the total BAL cell counts, were significantly suppressed in the SAMe-treated groups. A reduction in T helper type 2 pro-inflammatory cytokines and HNE levels was observed in mouse lung tissue after SAMe administration. Macrophages cultured with SAMe also showed reduced cellular oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, SAMe treatment attenuated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced fibronectin expression in cultured fibroblasts. SAMe had a suppressive effect on airway inflammation and fibrosis in a mouse model of chronic asthma, at least partially through the attenuation of oxidative stress and TGF-β-induced fibronectin expression. The results of this study suggest a potential role for SAMe as a novel therapeutic agent in chronic asthma."

Aragonite Crystallization in a Christmas-tree Model Microfluidic Device with the Addition of Magnesium Ions,2016,"['Christmas-tree model microfluidic device', 'aragonite', 'calcium carbonate']",,"Aragonite is an important dimorph of calcium carbonate, industrially and biologically. However, aragonite is so thermodynamically unstable that it is difficult to understand its formation mechanism. A continuous microfluidic system was employed, in which crystallization was induced only by diffusion in a micron-scale channel. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) formed by liquid-liquid reaction and magnesium ions (Mg2+) were used as additives. To assess the influence of Mg2+ concentration, the Mg2+/Ca2+ molar ratio was set to 1, 3, and 5. Laminar streams flowed in the detection channel with different concentration gradients.The initial crystallization time (tI.C) increased exponentially and the density of crystals decreased as the Mg2+ ion concentration increased. Following transformation of all particles into snowman or sphere shapes, they became spinose sphere-shaped crystals, which was the final form in this study."
Economic Reform during the First Four Years of Kim Jong-un’s Rule: An Analysis Based on the CRE Model,2016,"['North Korea', 'Reform', 'Socialist Transformation', 'CRE Model', 'Kim Jong-un Government']",,"The paper evaluates the effects of domestic and external actions on the probability of reform in North Korea. It applies the theory of Janos Kornai on socialist systems, in particular the main line of causation, as well as elements of rational choice theory. The CRE model provides a tool for systematically processing information on North Korea that is typically incomplete. The effects of 23 actions that have taken place since 2012 in the fields of ideology, property rights, coordination, military affairs and external influence are discussed. The combined outcome is mixed and corresponds with reality, where neither a retreat to pre-1990 socialism nor a full-fledged reform could be observed. However, new insights are found on single effects and their interplay. This provides a practical tool for scholars who aim for a systematic understanding of the past, and for politicians who need to conduct an advance impact analysis of future policies."
Cheering Event Detection in Basketball Audio Stream Using Adaptive GMM Model and Low Rank Matrix Recovery,2016,"['cheering event detection', 'adaptive GMM', 'STFT', 'low rank matrix recovery']",,"In this paper, we propose a new method to detect cheering events in basketball audio streams by combining short time Fourier transform (STFT) bin strengths, adaptive Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and low rank matrix recovery (LRR) approach.

In addition, we also propose to apply a post processing approach based on the LRR and power spectral density (PSD) within specified frequency interval to reduce false alarms and to improve the performance of the system. The experimental results on Korean basketball audio database demonstrate that our proposed method can outperform other well-known methods and achieve high accuracy. Specifically, recall rate, precision rate and F value are, respectively, 92.38%, 91.29% and 91.83%."

After topical application of the L. japonica growth factor mixture to a six-week-old C57BL/6 mouse model, analysis of hair re-growth was determined using a high-resolution hair analysis system, as well as, photographic and histologic analysis. Depilated areas were completely covered with fully-grown hair in all study groups (control group, L. japonica extract group, and L. japonica extract mixed with growth factor group) and the hair re-growth score was the highest in the group treated with L. japonica supplemented with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).The width and length of the hair follicles showed a significant increase in the groups treated with L. japonica mixed with IGF-1, compared to the control groups. Groups treated with L. japonica mixed with growth factor showed significantly increased gene expression of IGF-1 and decreased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, compared to the control groups. We confirmed that IGF-1 was more effective in promoting hair growth than vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Therefore, we suggest that L. japonica mixed with IGF-1 could successfully be used to treat patients with alopecia; however, clinical trials and additional studies on the side effects of the mixture are necessary."

With the perspective God`s image in Bible, this study analyzed the limitation and usefulness of Rizzuto`s theory. Then specific applications were suggested to Christian Counseling. According to understanding God`s image revealed by God`s works of creation and redemption in Bible, Rizzuto`s theory suggest limitations and usefulness as follows: the limitations of Rizzuto`s theory were that she considered only cognitive dimensions of God without thinking God`s Deity and the complete Humanity of Christ and regard God as a `transitional object` a kind of illusion. Moreover, her theory has a dangerous element to be adhere a specific God` image.

To explain a.l.i.c., we established one theory naming wrongfulness model. In wrongfulness model, the crime is defined as not only a conduct but also a causal process. The wrongfulness of crime is the assessment of the social harm. The causal wrongfulness is the assessment of the social harm of criminal process. And the culpability is defined as blameworthiness for the conduct or causal wrongfulness by intent or negligence. Now, we can explain a.l.i.c as the case that the crime has both causal wrongfulness and the blameworthy culpability for it although its perpetration is irresponsible. We can apply this wrongfulness model to explain the seven case patterns of a.l.i.c.. First pattern of a.l.i.c. is intent result crime. The causal wrongfulness of intent result crime is the causal process to result displayed intentionally. The second pattern is a.l.i.c. of conduct crime. The causal wrongfulness of conduct crime is causation relationship from earlier act to later act controlled by intent. The other patterns are the crimes of earlier negligence act and later negligence act, of earlier negligence act and later intent act, of earlier act and later involuntary act, of diminished capacity, of perpetration in insane state en route. We can affirm that our wrongfulness model can explain all seven patterns of case law in German and Japan. But traditional ``the elements of the crime model`` can explain only one pattern, the intent result crime. So we can say that theoretical superiority of our model proves. This means that the German theoretical system of crime must be reconsidered because the premises of our model imply the transformation of the established German theory of crime."

Due to these things, we need to figure out user activity model analysis framework first and access to data. In this paper, we suggest a novel framework model in order to analyze user activity model effectively. This model includes MapReduce process for analyzing massive data quickly in the distributed environment and data architecture design for analyzing user activity model.

Extracted signals which from Electronic field based sensor, EPS have much of the noise, so it must remove in pre-processing. After the noise are removed with filter using frequency feature, the signals are reconstructed with dimensional transformation to overcome limit which have just one-dimension feature with voltage value for using convolution operation. Then, the reconstructed signal data is finally classified and recognized using multiple learning layers model based on deep learning. Since the statistical model based on probability is sensitive to initial parameters, the result can change after training in modeling phase. Deep learning model can overcome this problem because of several layers in training phase.

In the light of all phase digital filtering theory, this paper proposes a novel transform based on discrete sine transform (DST), which is called all phase discrete sine biorthogonal transform (APDSBT). Applying APDSBT to JPEG scheme, the blocking artifacts are reduced significantly. The reconstructed image of APDSBT-JPEG is better than that of DCT-JPEG in terms of objective quality and subjective effect. For improving the efficiency of JPEG coding, the structure of JPEG is analyzed. We analyze key factors in design and evaluation of JPEG compression on the massive parallel graphics processing units (GPUs) using the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) programming model. Experimental results show that the maximum speedup ratio of parallel algorithm of APDSBT-JPEG can reach more than 100 times with a very low version GPU. Some new parallel strategies are illustrated in this paper for improving the performance of parallel algorithm. With the optimal strategy, the efficiency can be improved over 10%."
Doxazosin Treatment Attenuates Carbon Tetrachloride-Induced Liver Fibrosis in Hamsters through a Decrease in Transforming Growth Factor β Secretion,2016,"['Cirrhosis', 'Adrenergic pathway', 'Adrenergic receptor antagonist', 'Collagen', 'Transforming growth factor beta']",,"Background/Aims: The development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cirrhosis has become an important focus for basic and clinical researchers. Adrenergic receptor antagonists have been evaluated as antifibrotic drugs in rodent models of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of carvedilol and doxazosin on fibrosis/cirrhosis in a hamster animal model. Methods: Cirrhotic-induced hamsters were treated by daily administration of carvedilol and doxazosin for 6 weeks. Hepatic function and histological evaluation were conducted by measuring biochemical markers, including total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and albumin, and liver tissue slices. Additionally, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) immunohistochemistry was analyzed. Results: Biochemical markers revealed that hepatic function was restored after treatment with doxazosin and carvedilol. Histological evaluation showed a decrease in collagen type I deposits and TGF-β-secreting cells. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that the decrease in collagen type I following treatment with doxazosin or carvedilol is achieved by decreasing the profibrotic activities of TGF-β via the blockage of α1- and β-adrenergic receptor. Consequently, a diminution of fibrotic tissue in the CCl4-induced model of cirrhosis is achieved. (Gut Liver 2016;10:101-108)"
A New Image Clustering Method Based on the Fuzzy Harmony Search Algorithm and Fourier Transform,2016,"['Fourier Transform', 'Fuzzy Clustering', 'Harmony Search', 'Processing Image', 'Remote Sensing']",,"In the conventional clustering algorithms, an object could be assigned to only one group. However, this is sometimes not the case in reality, there are cases where the data do not belong to one group. As against, the fuzzy clustering takes into consideration the degree of fuzzy membership of each pixel relative to different classes. In order to overcome some shortcoming with traditional clustering methods, such as slow convergence and their sensitivity to initialization values, we have used the Harmony Search algorithm. It is based on the population metaheuristic algorithm, imitating the musical improvisation process. The major thrust of this algorithm lies in its ability to integrate the key components of population-based methods and local search-based methods in a simple optimization model. We propose in this paper a new unsupervised clustering method called the Fuzzy Harmony Search-Fourier Transform (FHS-FT). It is based on hybridization fuzzy clustering and the harmony search algorithm to increase its exploitation process and to further improve the generated solution, while the Fourier transform to increase the size of the image`s data. The results show that the proposed method is able to provide viable solutions as compared to previous work."

The excessive activation of Th2 cells due to insufficient suppression of regulatory T cells (Tregs) is thought to play a major role in the initiation and development of allergic airway disease. Several studies have shown that stem cells provide a significant reduction in allergic airway inflammation and improve lung function in animal models. The immunomodulatory effects of stem cells in allergic airway disease may be mediated by the up-regulation of Tregs and increases in several soluble factors, such as prostaglandin E2, transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-10, and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase. This review examines the current understanding of the immunomodulatory properties of stem cells and its therapeutic implication in allergic airway disease. Furthermore, we will discuss mechanisms by which stem cells inhibit allergic airway inflammation via immunomodulation from a Th2- to a Th1-biased response. (Allergy Asthma Respir Dis 2016;4:167-173)"

The starting point of this paper is that the success of German model of the 21st century would not be fully accounted without mentioning on the restructuring of the Euro capitalism.The following two tasks are performed in this paper. First, it explains the formative process of the Euro capitalism mediated by a phased intensification of European integration. After calling the attention to the relation of regime of accumulation at national level, Euro capitalism, and global political economy, this paper studies the major projects of European integration like single market, single currency, and the integration of financial market. Then it reconstructs how those projects can create successfully a common place of capitalism as its new space. Along with it, the characteristics of this Euro capitalism are mentioned. Secondly, it analyzes how German model has been changed in the process of European integration intensified and Euro capitalism constructed. Also it points out on Standortdebatte and privatization, Bündnis für Arbeit and Hartz reform, and the depression of wages under the Eurozone system in relation to the European integration. Germany can boost aggressive exports drive successfully owing to its competitiveness secured by so-called inner devaluation like wage depression and fiscal prudence, and in return the immense trade surplus of Germany proves its success. However, the equivalent attention should be paid to the fact that such a remarkable success of German model leads Euro capitalism into another way of a serious imbalance."

In this regard, liberal arts education needs to be dealt with from viewpoints of higher education, adult education, and lifelong education. In particular, as liberal arts education closely connects learning with life and is an area which should be responsible for emotional·intentional education, experience education is emerging as an essential method.Based on this issue, this study looked into the scope and conditions of experience education, the method and system of the curriculum design, and the cases of actual liberal arts curriculum operations. The recent trend that experience education has come to the fore as an area of liberal arts education among a variety of liberal arts education fields indicates that the outcomes of the operation of experience education in Mokwon university could set an example to other universities. Mokwon university is providing experience education in both major education and liberal arts education fields and the field of liberal arts education is especially being developed and operated with its focus on the subjects of personality and sensitivity. In the future, experience education should be provided in various areas but considering the nature of 'liberal arts', it appears that holistic and personal growth can be accomplished when physical, emotional, and moral education is highlighted.For experience-based liberal arts education to be a systematic educational achievement which is beyond a fragmentary and one-time experience and can promote changes and growth in students, a lot of efforts need to be made by educators. Specific and feasible guidance for experience education must be made and budget, academic affairs, administration, and extracurricular programs should be implemented to support such guidance. In this regard, experience education is not just one academic subject but also contributes to improving the quality of college education. In addition, its desired goals can be attained only when universities undergo fundamental changes.In the future, there is a need not only to operate experience-based liberal arts curriculum by tackling various problems but also to make efforts so that such an attempt can be transformed into open education for local communities and citizens."

Methods: A classification model for viable seeds was developed using partial least square discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) with Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) and Raman spectroscopic data in the range of 9080-4150 cm(-1) (1400-2400 nm) and 1800-970 cm(-1), respectively. The datasets were divided into 70% to calibration and 30% to validation. To reduce noise from the spectra and compare the classification results, preprocessing methods, such as mean, maximum, and range normalization, multivariate scattering correction, standard normal variate, and 1st and 2nd derivatives with the Savitzky-Golay algorithm were used. Results: The classification accuracies for calibration using FT-NIR and Raman spectroscopy were both 99% with first derivative, whereas the validation accuracies were 90.5% with both multivariate scattering correction and standard normal variate, and 96.4% with the raw data (non-preprocessed data). Conclusions: These results indicate that FT-NIR and Raman spectroscopy are valuable tools for a feasible classification and evaluation of viable pepper seeds by providing useful information based on PLS-DA and the threshold value."

Bankruptcy Prediction Modeling Using Qualitative Information Based on Big Data Analytics,2016,"['Bankruptcy Prediction', 'Big Data Analytics', 'Text Mining', 'Sentiment Analysis', 'Artificial Neural Networks', '부도예측', '빅데이터 분석', '텍스트 마이닝', '감성 분석', '인공신경망']",,"Many researchers have focused on developing bankruptcy prediction models using modeling techniques, such as statistical methods including multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and logit analysis or artificial intelligence techniques containing artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM), to secure enhanced performance. Most of the bankruptcy prediction models in academic studies have used financial ratios as main input variables. The bankruptcy of firms is associated with firm’s financial states and the external economic situation. However, the inclusion of qualitative information, such as the economic atmosphere, has not been actively discussed despite the fact that exploiting only financial ratios has some drawbacks. Accounting information, such as financial ratios, is based on past data, and it is usually determined one year before bankruptcy. Thus, a time lag exists between the point of closing financial statements and the point of credit evaluation. In addition, financial ratios do not contain environmental factors, such as external economic situations. Therefore, using only financial ratios may be insufficient in constructing a bankruptcy prediction model, because they essentially reflect past corporate internal accounting information while neglecting recent information.  Thus, qualitative information must be added to the conventional bankruptcy prediction model to supplement accounting information. Due to the lack of an analytic mechanism for obtaining and processing qualitative information from various information sources, previous studies have only used qualitative information. However, recently, big data analytics, such as text mining techniques, have been drawing much attention in academia and industry, with an increasing amount of unstructured text data available on the web. A few previous studies have sought to adopt big data analytics in business prediction modeling. Nevertheless, the use of qualitative information on the web for business prediction modeling is still deemed to be in the primary stage, restricted to limited applications, such as stock prediction and movie revenue prediction applications. Thus, it is necessary to apply big data analytics techniques, such as text mining, to various business prediction problems, including credit risk evaluation. Analytic methods are required for processing qualitative information represented in unstructured text form due to the complexity of managing and processing unstructured text data.  This study proposes a bankruptcy prediction model for Korean small- and medium-sized construction firms using both quantitative information, such as financial ratios, and qualitative information acquired from economic news articles. The performance of the proposed method depends on how well information types are transformed from qualitative into quantitative information that is suitable for incorporating into the bankruptcy prediction model. We employ big data analytics techniques, especially text mining, as a mechanism for processing qualitative information. The sentiment index is provided at the industry level by extracting from a large amount of text data to quantify the external economic atmosphere represented in the media. The proposed method involves keyword-based sentiment analysis using a domain-specific sentiment lexicon to extract sentiment from economic news articles. The generated sentiment lexicon is designed to represent sentiment for the construction business by considering the relationship between the occurring term and the actual situation with respect to the economic condition of the industry rather than the inherent semantics of the term.  The experimental results proved that incorporating qualitative information based on big data analytics into the traditional bankruptcy prediction model based on accounting information is effective for enhancing the predictive performance.

Tool-Wear Monitoring during Micro-End Milling using Wavelet Packet Transform and Fisher's Linear Discriminant,2016,"['Condition monitoring', 'Hidden Markov model', 'Micro end mill', 'Single-period signal', 'Tool lifespan', 'Wavelet packet transform']",,"Tool wear is one of the most important parameters in micro-end milling, and can be used to monitor the condition of the machine and the tool. A micro-end mill has different characteristics from a macro-scale end mill; in particular, shank run-out (which is negligible in the macro-scale tool due to the low aspect ratio) is significant in micro-end milling, inducing excessive tool wear and reduced tool life and leading to sudden, premature failure. In this paper, a novel tool-wear monitoring method is described for determining the state of a micro-end mill using wavelet packet transforms and Fisher’s linear discriminant. Force and torque signals were measured using a dynamometer and were used to reflect geometric changes in the micro-end mill due to wear. Because of the small signal-to-noise ratio, sensor signals measured during the milling process were periodically averaged, and the resulting singleperiod signals provided improved efficiency of feature extraction using wavelet packet transforms. The extracted features were classified in the wavelet domain and used to determine the tool state employing a hidden Markov model. The recognition results were compared with those of an energy-based monitoring technique, and we found that our method could determine the tool state more accurately for both normal wear and premature failure of micro-end mills."

In Vivo Rodent Models of Skeletal Muscle Adaptation to Decreased Use,2016,"['Atrophy', 'Disuse', 'Aging']",,"Skeletal muscle possesses plasticity and adaptability to external and internal physiological changes. Due to these characteristics, skeletal muscle shows dramatic changes depending on its response to stimuli such as physical activity, nutritional changes, disease status, and environmental changes. Modulation of the rate of protein synthesis/degradation plays an important role in atrophic responses. The purpose of this review is to describe different features of skeletal muscle adaptation with various models of deceased use. In this review, four models were addressed: immobilization, spinal cord transection, hindlimb unloading, and aging. Immobilization is a form of decreased use in which skeletal muscle shows electrical activity, tension development, and motion. These results differ by muscle group. Spinal cord transection was selected to simulate spinal cord injury. Similar to the immobilization model, dramatic atrophy occurs in addition to fiber type conversion in this model. Despite the fact that electromyography shows unremarkable changes in muscle after hindlimb unloading, decreased muscle mass and contractile force are observed. Lastly, aging significantly decreases the numbers of muscle fibers and motor units. Skeletal muscle responses to decreased use include decreased strength, decreased fiber numbers, and fiber type transformation. These four models demonstrated different changes in the skeletal muscle. This review elucidates the different skeletal muscle adaptations in these four decreased use animal models and encourages further studies."

A New Image Clustering Method Based on the Fuzzy Harmony Search Algorithm and Fourier Transform,2016,"['Fourier Transform', 'Fuzzy Clustering', 'Harmony Search', 'Processing Image', 'Remote Sensing']",,"In the conventional clustering algorithms, an object could be assigned to only one group. However, this is sometimes not the case in reality, there are cases where the data do not belong to one group. As against, the fuzzy clustering takes into consideration the degree of fuzzy membership of each pixel relative to different classes. In order to overcome some shortcoming with traditional clustering methods, such as slow convergence and their sensitivity to initialization values, we have used the Harmony Search algorithm. It is based on the population metaheuristic algorithm, imitating the musical improvisation process. The major thrust of this algorithm lies in its ability to integrate the key components of population-based methods and local search-based methods in a simple optimization model. We propose in this paper a new unsupervised clustering method called the Fuzzy Harmony Search-Fourier Transform (FHS-FT). It is based on hybridization fuzzy clustering and the harmony search algorithm to increase its exploitation process and to further improve the generated solution, while the Fourier transform to increase the size of the image's data. The results show that the proposed method is able to provide viable solutions as compared to previous work."
A comparison of inverse transform and composition methods of data simulation from the Lindley distribution,2016,"['Lindley distribution', 'simulation', 'inverse transform', 'composition', 'mixture density', 'weighted density', 'random variable', 'Lambert function']",,"This study compares the inverse transform and the composition methods for generating data from the Lindley distribution. The expression for the inverse of the distribution function for the Lindley distribution does not exist in closed form. Hence, authors of many empirical studies on the Lindley distribution used methods for generating Lindley variates other than the inverse transform. We generated data from the Lindley distribution using the inverse transform approach by obtaining the Lindley variates numerically; we also generated data from this distribution using the composition approach. Following the generation of the Lindley variates using these two methods, we compare some statistical properties of the estimates of the Lindley model parameters based on the generated data. We conclude that the two methods produce similar results."

In this paper, we conduct comparative performance tests on the linear filter with known integral transforms. We examine three kinds of filters developed by W. L. Anderson, F. N. Kong and H. Mizunaga, which are known to be suitable for marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) applications. Kong’s filters perform best in the three kinds of filters over a practical range of offset distances in marine CSEM surveys. While the relative error versus distance appears as a V-shaped curve in semi-log scale, Mizunaga’s filters are the shortest in length and have a performance comparable to Kong’s filters. Anderson’s filters have a quite similar performance between the J0 and J1 filters, although these are somewhat inferior to Kong’s and Mizunaga’s filters when computing marine CSEM fields."

DNA methylation changes in extracellular remodeling pathway genes during the transformation of human mesenchymal stem cells,2016,"['DNA methylation', 'ECM remodeling pathway', 'Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)', 'Transformation']",,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules are essential structural components that exhibit important functional roles in the control of key cellular events, including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The ECM remodeling pathway is also important for tumorigenesis and the metastatic progression of cancer. In this study, we determined the methylation pattern of nineteen ECM genes in colon cancer cell lines and demonstrated that these genes were frequently hypermethylated in primary colon tissues. Upon extracting gene expression profile data of the mouse epithelium and mesenchymal compartments, we found that several ECM genes (CD109, EVL, FBN2, FLNC, IGFBP3, MMP2, and LAMA1) were highly expressed in the mesenchymal compartment.These results were confirmed via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Moreover, we demonstrated the correlation between transcriptional silencing and the promoter hypermethylation of LAMA1, FBN2, and IGFBP3 during the transformation of the mesenchymal stem cell model system using key genetic alterations that develop during human malignance. Interestingly, MMP2, IGFBP3, and LAMA1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased during the transformation. In terms of transcriptional silencing by promoter DNA hypermethylation, the lack of LAMA1 mRNA expression was associated with its promoter hypermethylation in the last step of transformation, which develops to malignancies. Overall, our data suggest that ECM alterations by hypermethylated genes may contribute to carcinogenesis through the silencing of ECM pathway genes by epigenetic alterations."

In this study, we therefore tried to suggest the more effective way to transform the height information were constructed separately according to each height datum on land and sea to those on the unique height datum using precise geoid models and tidal observations in Korea. For this, Anmyeon island was selected as a study area to develop the precise geoid models based on the height datums land (IMSL) and sea (LMSL), respectively. In order to develop two hybrid geoid models based on each height datum of land an sea, we firstly develop a precise gravimetric geoid model using the remove and restore (R-R) technique with all available gravity observations. The gravimetric geoid model were then fitted to the geometric geoidal heights, each of which is represented as height datum of land or sea respectively, obtained from GPS/Leveling results on 15 TBMs in the study area. Finally, we determined the differences between the two hybrid geoid models to apply the height transformation between IMSL and LMSL. The co-tidal chart model of TideBed system developed by Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency (KHOA) which was re-gridded to have the same grid size and coverage as the geoid model, in order that this can be used for the height datum transformation from LMSL to local AHHW and/or from LMSL to local DL. The accuracy of height datum transformation based on the strategy suggested in this study was approximately ±3 cm. It is expected that the results of this study can help minimize not only the confusions on the use of geo-spatial information due to the disagreement caused by different height datum, land and sea, in Korea, but also the economic and time losses in the execution of coastal development and disaster prevention projects in the future."

The research methodologies adopted include studying literature textiles, including relevant books and journals at home and abroad, major websites in fashion industry, fashion collections, news articles and case studies focused on visual textiles drawn from fashion books. The scope of this study runs the gamut from early 2000s when transformable fashions combined with technology came into surface in earnest to today. The research findings are as follows. First, the concept of being ‘transformable’ and the background of its appearance have been explained by de-constructivism of post modernism and a combination between fashion and technology. Second , transformable textiles have been classified into self-transformation, awareness of surrounding environment, and user interaction before analyzing their characteristics, respectively. The study has found that the aesthetic characteristics shown in contemporary fashion have been expressed in multilateral indeterminacy, visual pleasure, complex ornamentation, and 3-dimensional spatiality. First, multilateral indeterminacy has been expressed in open form that is to be completed freely depending on users and environment. Second, visual pleasure has turned out to bring interest from a brand new form and totally unexpected surprise. Third, complex ornamentation has been built in a new aesthetic quality obtained through a mix & match of heterogeneous textiles. Fourth, 3-dimensional spatiality has been shown in the cubic effect and spatial sense shown in two-dimensional flat textiles. These analysis results are expected to be utilized as the basic guideline to provide a framework for understanding and utilization of transformable textiles unlike previous studies mostly focused on transformable design itself while providing the possibility and vision of creative modeling sense with the use of human synaesthesia by examining the aesthetic characteristics of transformable textiles in fashion."

Our aim is to provide a general simulation platform to model these batch bioprocesses in commercial process simulators and explain how to transform batch processes with varying reaction rate into continuous unit operations for simulation purposes. Two typical fermentation processes, lactose fermentation and glucose/xylose co-fermentation, were simulated in steady state as case studies. The results are discussed as examples using the proposed approach. The potential of how to extend the simulation platform is also explained in detail."

Supplementation with ASE 0.1% and 0.5% effectively lowered levels of glucose, insulin, oral glucose tolerance test, and Homa-insulin resistance, suggesting reduced insulin resistance. Blood levels of HbA1c and AGEs were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. As oxidative stress plays a key role in accelerating production of HbA1c and AGEs, which worsen symptoms of type 2 diabetes, levels of malonaldehyde and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured. Lipid peroxidation in both blood and liver tissues was significantly reduced, and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-β and tumor necrosis factor-α, which elevate production of HbA1c and AGEs, was inhibited (P<0.05). To evaluate the possible cellular events after AGEs receptor activation, genetic expression of protein kinase C (PKC)-δ and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Supplementation with both ASE 0.1% and 0.5% significantly inhibited mRNA expression of PKC-δ and TGF-β, indicating that ASE may have beneficial effects on preventing insulin-resistant cells or tissues from progressing to diabetic complications. Taken together, ASE has potential to improve type 2 diabetes by inhibiting insulin resistance and protein glycosylation, including production of HbA1c and AGEs. Anti-oxidative activities of ASE are a main requisite for reducing production of HbA1c and AGEs and are also related to regulation of the PKC signaling pathway, resulting in suppression of TGF-β, which increases synthesis of collagen, prostaglandin, and disease-related proteins."
AUTOMOTIVE WINDOW SEAL DESIGN CONSIDERING EXTERNAL AERODYNAMIC LOAD AND SURROGATE CONSTRAINT MODELING,2016,"['Aerodynamic load', 'Surrogate constraint modeling', 'Automotive window seal', 'Numerical analysis']",,"−Installed between metallic DIW (Door in White) panel and nonmetallic door glass, automotive window seals has great influence on customers’ perception of NVH (Noise-Vibration-Harshness) performance. Recently, aerodynamic effect on ride comfort attracts increasing research interest. The external load causes unsteady pressure on glass, which is finally transferred to window seals and leads to complicated vibration and increases interior noise level. However, non-linearities of hyper-elastic material, rubber-glass contact and large deformation behavior make the construction of window seals constraint model much more difficult, thus impeding further analysis and optimization. A new window seal design method is proposed featuring in considering aerodynamics-induced load and nonlinear constraint. Firstly, by SST− k − ε (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence model, external flow field of full-scale automotive is established by solving three-dimensional, steady and uncompressible Navier-Stokes equation. With re-exploited mapping algorithm, the overall aerodynamic pressure is extracted and matched to local window as external loads for seals, thus taking into account high speed fluid-structure interaction.Secondly, based on functional equivalence and mathematical fitting, new surrogate constraint model is presented. The unitedseal CLD (Compression Load Deflection) curve is synthesized after translations and transformations from two semi-seal CLD experimental measurements of inner and outer lips. It is then fit to complex exponential function, making seal constraint equivalent to a surrogate elastic constraint with variable stiffness. Experiment is performed to verify the constraint surrogation effectiveness. Finally, case study of window seal design under high speed is investigated. After seal optimization based on the new method, windows seals’ maximal displacements have decreased. The improved seal-glass fitting status shows better NVH quality of window seal in high-speed condition."

The proposed system can measure driver’s eye gaze. This is done by concept of information delivery and mutual information measure. For this study, we set up two web-cameras at vehicles to obtain visual information of the driver and front of the vehicle. We propose Gestalt principle based selective attention model to define information quantity of road scene. The saliency map based on gestalt principle is prominently represented by stimulus such as traffic signals. The proposed system assumes driver’s cognitive resource allocation on the front scene by gaze analysis and head pose direction information. Then we use several feature algorithms for detecting driver’s characteristics in real time. Modified census transform (MCT) based Adaboost is used to detect driver’s face and its component whereas POSIT algorithms are used for eye detection and 3D head pose estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed system works well in real environment and confirm its usability."

Finally, this study applies the aforementioned practical knowledge and strategies to develop a reference model for promoting gender mainstreaming in higher educational institutions."
Modeling of fractional magneto-thermoelasticity for a perfect conducting materials,2016,"['generalized magneto-thermoelasticity', 'fractional calculus', 'laplace transforms', 'state space approach', 'numerical results']",,"A unified mathematical model of the equations of generalized magneto-thermoelasticty based on fractional derivative heat transfer for isotropic perfect conducting media is given. Some essential theorems on the linear coupled and generalized theories of thermoelasticity e.g. the Lord- Shulman (LS) theory, Green-Lindsay (GL) theory and the coupled theory (CTE) as well as dual-phase-lag (DPL) heat conduction law are established. Laplace transform techniques are used. The method of the matrix exponential which constitutes the basis of the state-space approach of modern theory is applied to the non-dimensional equations. The resulting formulation is applied to a variety of one-dimensional problems. The solutions to a thermal shock problem and to a problem of a layer media are obtained in the present of a transverse uniform magnetic field. According to the numerical results and its graphs, conclusion about the new model has been constructed.

Simultaneous estimation of saponin contents from soybean seed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis,2016,"['Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy', 'HPLC', 'PCA', 'PLS-DA', 'PLS regression', 'Prediction', 'Saponins', 'Soybean']",,"The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for simultaneous determination of saponin contents in different soybean cultivars. In cross validation between predicted content of saponin by PLS regression modeling from FT-IR spectra and measured content by HPLC, total saponin contents were predicted with good accuracy (R2 C ≥ 0.71). In external validation, saponin group Ab (R2 = 0.88), saponin DDMP-group bg( R2 = 0.85), total saponin group B (R2 = 0.88), and total saponin content (R2 = 0.87) were predicted with good accuracy, while prediction for saponin group Aa (R2 = 0.58), saponin group Bb0 (R2 = 0.58), and total saponin group A (R2 = 0.25) had relatively lower accuracy. Considering these results, we suggest that the PLS prediction system for saponin contents using FT-IR analysis could be applied as a novel screening tool for high yielding lines in soybean breeding."
Synthesis of Mechanisms Integrated with Motion and Force Transformation,2016,"['Force transformation', 'Functional synthesis', 'Motion transformation', 'Synthesis of mechanisms']",,"The synthesis of mechanisms has an important effect in the product development. A mechanism has two basic kinds of functions, i.e.to transform motion and to transform force. However, current methods always focus on either motion synthesis or force synthesis. The paper proposed a dynamic programming-based synthesis of multi-input or multi-output mechanisms with the simultaneous consideration of motion and force transmission. A general function model is proposed with a result of function matrix of mechanisms. After the solving process of single input and single output (SISO) system using dynamic programming algorithm is proposed, the single input and multiple outputs (SIMO) system, and the multiple inputs and single output system (MISO) are also discussed in detail, together with design evaluation. The synthesis of mechanisms for jacking up system in offshore platform is taken as an example, which demonstrates that the methodology is helpful to produce valuable mechanisms."
Investigation of Degradative Signals on Outdoor Solid Insulators Using Continuous Wavelet Transform,2016,"['Continuous wavelet transform', 'Breakdown', 'Solid insulator', 'Tracking', 'Discharge', 'Leakage']",,"Most outdoor solid insulators may suffer from surface degradations due to non-stationary currents that flow on the insulator surface. These currents may be classified as leakage, discharge and tracking currents due to their disturbing potencies respectively. The magnitude of these currents depends on the degree of the contamination of surface. The leakage signals are followed by discharge signals and tracking signals which are capable of forming carbonized tracking paths on the surface between high voltage and earth contacts (surface tracking). Surface tracking is one of the most breakdown mechanisms observed on the solid insulators, especially polymers which may cause severely reduced lifetime. In this study the degradations observed on polyester resin based insulators are investigated according to the IEC 587 Inclined Plane Test Standard. The signals are monitored and recorded during tests until surface tracking initiated. In order to prevent total breakdown of an insulator, early detection of tracking signals is vital. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is proposed for classification of signals and their energy levels observed on the surface. The application of CWT for processing and classification of the surface signals which are prone to display high frequency oscillations can facilitate real time monitoring of the system for diagnosis."
A Topological Transformation and Hierarchical Compensation Capacitor Control in Segmented On-road Charging System for Electrical Vehicles,2016,"['Hierarchical compensation capacitor control', 'Receiving power', 'Segmented on-road charging', 'Topological transformation']",,"Experiencing power declines when the secondary coil is at the middle position between two primary coils is a serious problem in segmented on-road charging systems with a single energized segmented primary coil. In this paper, the topological transformation of a primary circuit and a hierarchical compensation capacitor control are proposed. Firstly, the corresponding compensation capacitors and receiving powers of different primary structures are deduced under the condition of a fixed frequency. Then the receiving power characteristics as a function of the position variations in systems with a single energized segmented primary coil and those with double segmented primary coils are analyzed comparatively. A topological transformation of the primary circuit and hierarchical compensation capacitor control are further introduced to solve the foregoing problem. Finally, an experimental prototype with the proposed topological transformation and hierarchical compensation capacitor control is carried out. Measured results show that the receiving power is a lot more stable in the movement of the secondary coil. It is a remarkable fact that the receiving power rises from 10.8W to 19.2W at the middle position between the two primary coils. The experimental are in agreement with the theoretical analysis."

The common consensus is, as Korean and Chinese have shared a long history of geo-graphical and anthropological contact, numerous Chinese lexical words has been borrowed, or loaned to Korean. Yet due to the differences in typology of the two languages, grammatical phenomenon would prove more difficult to transfer. The crux of grammatical replication states that even if two languages experience different grammatical phenomena as long as geographical and anthropological contacts are established, the grammatical phenomenon of one language can be transferred to the other Numerous European Languages` history of transferring from other grammati-cal systems through grammatical replication has been an issue of many discussions and research as of late. With this established, the grammaticalization that allowed verb to transform to adposition in Chinese was replicated (transferred) to the trans-formation from verb to postposition in Korean. This replication processes is essen- tial in establishing a universal model for grammatical replication. As grammatical replication is most evident in the field of literary translations, the undisputable rule of correspondence can be seen in the likes of DWUSI ENHAI(杜詩諺解, translation of poem of DUFU(杜甫)) and the translated version of LAO QIDA(老乞大)."

No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Using Complex Characteristics of Shearlet Transform,2016,"['Image quality measure', 'no-reference', 'complex shearlet transform', 'SVM']",,"The field of Image Quality Measure (IQM) is growing rapidly in recent years. In particular, there was a significant progress in No-Reference (NR) IQM methods. In this paper, a general-purpose NR IQM algorithm is proposed based on the statistical characteristics of natural images in shearlet domain. The method utilizes a set of distortion-sensitive features extracted from statistical properties of shearlet coefficients. A complex version of the shearlet transform is employed to take advantage of phase and amplitude features in quality estimation. Furthermore, since shearlet transform can analyze the images at multiple scales, the effect of distortion on across-scale dependencies of shearlet coefficients is explored for feature extraction. For quality prediction, the features are used to train image classification and quality prediction models using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results show that the proposed NR IQM is highly correlated with human subjective assessment and outperforms several Full-Reference (FR) and state-of-art NR IQMs."

In order to handle ontology data change situation, a version handling system is needed to keep track of changes. For example, the queries subject to the previous ontology may become inconsistent and must be updated according to the newest version of ontology.

"Transformational Leadership, Organizational Commitment, and Mediating Effect of Trust",2016,"['Transformational Leadership', 'Organizational Commitment', 'Trust']",,"This study has analyzed the interrelation between transformational leadership (TL) and organizational commitment (OC) so as to verify the mediating effect of their trust on OC, finding that charisma and intellectual stimulus have a significant effect on affective and continuous commitment. This finding is different from any existing arguments where the charisma of TL and the individual consideration are said to have a significant and positive effect on affective and continuous commitment. Furthermore, the mediating effect, which was expected to be highly relevant on the grounds of the findings ofprevious researches that any high trust ofa leader would lead to a high level of OC of members, has been revealed as a complete mediation in the relationship of emotional trust between individual consideration and OC, which shows that the correlation between TL and OC may vary depending on the characteristics of an organization and its members both of which are sample objects. This study, unlike most previous researches with their research samples inindustrial fields, has estimated the growing interrelation of NGOs.

In welcher Form diese Wiedervereinigung vollzogen werden wird, wissen wir heute noch nicht. Deshalb möchte ich im folgenden mein Thema auf der Grundlage zweier unterschiedlicher Szenarien behandeln. Das erste Szenario fußt auf der June 15th North-South Joint Declaration (2000), die von einer Wiedervereinigung in der Form einer Konföderation – so die Vorstellung des Südens – bzw. von einer losen Föderation – so der Vorschlag des Nordens – spricht, wobei nach dem Vorschlag Kim Il Sungs vom Oktober 1980 die Gesellschaftssysteme beider Teile Koreas koexistieren sollten. Diese Declaration ist aus nordkoreanischer Sicht immer noch aktuell. Der nordkoreanische Außenminister Ri Su Yong hat auf der UNO-Vollversammlung am 27.9.2014 eine Konföderation mit zwei Systemen in einem Land angeregt. In seiner Neujahrsansprache 2016 hat Marschall (Wonsu) Kim Jong Un einer Veränderung des Systems in Nordkorea und einer einseitigen Systemvereinigung eine Absage erteilt. Erst kürzlich wieder hat Nordkorea das Modell der Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands für Korea abgelehnt. Darum empfehlen auch in Südkorea manche Wissenschaftler, das politische Vorgehen zunächst auf der Basis einer low-level confederation der beiden Koreas statt auf der Grundlage einer vielleicht erst später möglichen vollständigen Wiedervereinigung zu planen. Deshalb gehe ich im ersten Teil meines Vortrags von einem Fortbestand des nordkoreanischen Wirtschaftssystems und seiner landwirtschaftlichen Genossenschaften in einem Wiedervereinigungsprozess aus. Dieser erste Teil meiner Präsentation fußt auf einem Vortrag, den ich im September 2014 an der Kim Il Sung-Universität in Pyongyang gehalten habe und der in einem Publikationsorgan der Kim Il Sung-Universität veröffentlicht werden wird.

However the researches for forecasting of wildfire are limited to individual approaches to weather, accessibility and duration. In order to overcome that limitations, we first transformed human-caused wildfire data out of total wildfire data from 1991 to 2015, 25 years data, to 5km grid data and utilized that grid based data to the studies.

In this context, I would like to construct the leaning-teaching model for educational process of upper elementary school students in the point of view of INRC transformation. I want this model to make the teacher have a new system of knowledge, and make it possible to construct the integrating education of elementary school. With this purpose, I would first analyse the property of the INRC transformation, and the possibility of its application into the educational process of mathematic-scientific and language-social text. In other word, I would like to argue that this structure is not only the principle of mathematical reasoning, but also the linguistical. As an example, I would analyse the concept of proportion in order to see the function of this structure in the thinking of elementary school students. Secondly, I would analyse 8 stages which the teacher of elementary school should understand and fallow: 1) questioning, 2) defining the elementary concept, 3) structuring the relationship between conceptions, 4) expressing the structuralization into propositional form, 5) transforming the propositional form into mathematical form, 6) visualizing the mathematical form into picture or graph, 7) making an application of the structure into concrete situation, 8) searching the contrary example violating this principle. These 8 stages are not only for teachers, but also the students. The model that I would like to construct is neither the leaning nor the teaching, but learning-teaching model."

The imaginary archetype and the principle of maintaining the archetype under the Act posed many conflicts and problems, but the near-extinct Pansori has apparently been able to retain its traditional form up to the present day because it was listed as an intangible heritage within the Act. However, given the changing system of and environment surrounding intangible cultural heritage, there is a pressing need to define the new direction for Pansori. Maintenance of the archetype that has distorted the true implication of the heritage and preservation of Pansori should be changed: Pansori should be inherited and preserved in a totally different direction by changing the archetype concept to a model concept and by adapting to the changing global environment. Embraced by the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, conditions such as the coexistence of traditionality and modernity, representation, and community features require the establishment of intangible cultural heritage that is open to the world, rather than closed. This requirement is imperative.Pansori needs to be re-contextualized in the intangible cultural heritage system wherein the archetype is transformed to a model. With attention focused on its entertainment features, Pansori should acquire characteristics of festivity or play, shedding its hereto-embraced artistry that anyone can access through ordinary life. If Pansori has previously evolved from festivity and play into an artform, it should now reverse its development direction from art to play and festivity."

In developing the competence curriculum model, functionalism has been postulated along with liberal thought, which presents a partial model for vocational education. Respecting the totalistic nature of competence, I propose a metaphor of identity as a post-functionalistic model of curriculum development with a warm-competence-based curriculum. The term “identity” has taken on a great many different meanings in the literature. I sketch out but one approach that draws on a consistent strand of participation. I propose new directions for the development of an identity-based curriculum, as follows: First, personalized curriculum should be seen as a life project. Designing a personalized curriculum does not mean developing customized courses; instead, the courses should involve self-directed, deep, and long-term learning. The school curriculum should take support for individual learning portfolios as a primary principle in its development. Second, the curriculum should include subject and non-subject contents. A competence-based curriculum requires a critical perspective related to the dualism of knowledge and experience in favor of situated practice. The separation of the subject from non-subject curriculum in the current national curriculum should be re-organized. Third, a community-based curriculum should be developed. Living community features a classroom culture of mutual respect and caring based on practical ethics and the accountability of community members. A learning community allows the school to be transformed into a learning organization where members of the community form their identities. Fourth, a school culture should be fashioned that represents its own character. Competence is encouraged to develop through participation in a culture; this conditions the ecological environment of learning."

To hurdle the ambiguity and incompleteness of evaluation process, fuzzy linguistic variables are used when the matrices for criteria and alternatives are built. In addition, to deal with lack of information, Demspter-Shafer (DS) evidential theory is applied to the MCDM evaluation scheme. Belief intervals composed of belief function and plausible function are converted to crisp values through the PPT (pignistic probability transformation) method and the quadratic programming with weighted loss objective function.

The Act provides that the states and the local authorities responsible for education ensure students with disabilities to timely access to the instructional materials, mostly by concluding a contract with textbook publishers to make sure it as a contractual performance. The NIMAC plays a practically crucial role in collecting, reviewing and authorizing the access to the so-called NIMAS format of the materials which should be transformed and finalized afterwards in order to be used in the classroom by students individually.

COPP 모델이란 창조성(Creativity), 시장성(Opportunity), 생산성(Productivity), 그리고 선제적 대응성(Proactivity)이 선순환 해야 기업생태계의 지속가능성장이 만들어 질 수 있다는 것이다. 선제적 대응성(Proactivity) 이란 현재 만들어진 이익을 미래환경변화에 미래 선제적으로 투자하려는 기업가정신의 발로이며, 이러한 미래투자 없이는 현재의 저주(Curse of Incumbency)를 극복하기 어렵기 때문이다. 이 모델을 중심으로 삼성전자동반성장의 주요 성과를 살펴보면 다음과 같다. 첫째, 시장성이 창조성, 생산성, 그리고 수익창출의 매개변수가 되고 있음을 발견 하였다. 즉, 수출(시장성)하는 협력기업일수록 연구개발투자(창조성)가 기업의 생산성, 수익성으로 연결되고 있었다. 반면 수출을 하지 않는 협력업체일수록 연구개발투자가 수익 성과로 연결되지 않는다는 것을 발견하였다. 둘째, 창조성, 시장성, 생산성, 미래 선제적 대응성의 순환 구조에 있어서, 선제적 대응성의 결과인 미래를 위한 연구개발비 투자를 많이 할수록(선제적 대응성) 특허를 많이 등록(창조성)하고, 특허를 많이 등록한 기업은 수출을 많이 하고(시장성), 수출을 많이 하는 기업은 영업이익(생산성, 수익성)이 높다는 것을 발견할 수 있었다. 이제 중소기업은 글로벌시장에 진출할 수 있는 경쟁력 보완 없이 지속적인 성장은 어렵다. 본 연구의 결과, 미래를 위한 투자인 선제적 대응성이 높은 기업일수록 창조성-시장성-생산성의 선순환이 이루어지고, 이것이 글로벌강소기업으로 진화하는 길임을 보여주는 전략적 시사점을 얻을 수 있었다.","With increasing adoption of smart products and complexity, companies have shifted their strategies from stand alone and competitive strategies to business ecosystem oriented and cooperative strategies. The win-win growth of business refers to corporate efforts undertaken by companies to pursue the healthiness of business between conglomerates and partnering companies such as suppliers for mutual prosperity and a long-term corporate soundness based on their business ecosystem and cooperative strategies. This study is designed to validate a theoretical proposition that the win-win growth strategy of Samsung Electronics and cooperative efforts among companies can create a healthy business ecosystem, based on results of case studies and surveys. In this study, a level of global market access of small and mid-sized companies is adopted as the key achievement index. The foreign market entry is considered as one of vulnerabilities in the ecosystem of small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs). For SMEs, the global market access based on the research and development (R&D) has become the critical component in the process of transforming them into global small giants. The results of case studies and surveys are analyzed mainly based on a model of a virtuous cycle of Creativity, Opportunity, Productivity, and Proactivity (the COPP model) that features the characteristics of the healthiness of a business ecosystem. In the COPP model, a virtuous circle of profits made by the first three factors and Proactivity, which is the manifestation of entrepreneurship that proactively invests and reacts to the changing business environment of the future, enhances the healthiness of a given business ecosystem. With the application of the COPP model, this study finds major achievements of the win-win growth of Samsung Electronics as follows. First, Opportunity plays a role as a parameter in the relations of Creativity, Productivity, and creating profits. Namely, as companies export more (with more Opportunity), they are more likely to link their R&D efforts to Productivity and profitability. However, companies that do not export tend to fail to link their R&D investment to profitability. Second, this study finds that companies with huge investment on R&D for the future, which is the result of Proactivity, tend to hold a large number of patents (Creativity). And companies with significant numbers of patents tend to be large exporters as well (Opportunity), and companies with a large amount of exports tend to record high profitability (Productivity and profitability), and thus forms the virtuous cycle of the COPP model. In addition, to access global markets for sustainable growth, SMEs need to build and strengthen their competitiveness. This study concludes that companies with a high level of proactivity to invest for the future can create a virtuous circle of Creativity, Opportunity, Productivity, and Proactivity, thereby providing a strategic implication that SMEs should invest time and resources in forming such a virtuous cycle which is a sure way for the SMEs to grow into global small giants."

Time for each period was set to 30-40 minutes in this program development."
Altered Biological Potential and Radioresponse of Murine Tumors in Different Microenvironments,2016,"['Tumor microenvironment', 'Hepatocarcinoma', 'Radiation']",,"Purpose This study was conducted to evaluate the biological features of murine hepatocarcinoma according to different tumor microenvironmental models and to determine the change in molecular and immunologic responses after radiation.Materials and Methods Tumor models were established in the liver (orthotopic) and thigh (heterotopic) of male C3H/HeN mice. Tumor growth and lung metastasis were assessed in these models. To evaluate the radiation effect, the tumors were irradiated with 10 Gy. Factors associated with tumor microenvironment including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX-2), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-!1), CD31, and serum interleukin- 6 (IL-6) were evaluated. Tumor-infiltrating regulatory immune cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were also analyzed.Results A higher number of lung metastases were observed in the orthotopic tumor model than in the heterotopic tumor model. VEGF, CD31, COX-2, and TGF-!1 expression was more prominent in the orthotopic tumor model than in the heterotopic tumor model. Expression of the angiogenic factor VEGF and key regulatory molecules (TGF-!1 and COX-2) decreased following radiation in the orthotopic tumor model, while the serum IL-6 level increased after radiation. In the orthotopic tumor model, the number of both Tregs and MDSCs in the tumor burden decreased after radiation.Conclusion The orthotopic tumor model showed higher metastatic potential and more aggressive molecular features than the heterotopic tumor model. These findings suggest that the orthotopic tumor mouse model may be more reflective of the tumor microenvironment and suitable for use in the translational research of radiation treatment."

The research analysis is based on the gambling industry regulation model (Kingma, 2008), policy type(Lowi, 1964; 1972) and governance theory(Rhodes, 1996). There are three regulation model with Prohibit Model, Alibi Model and Risk Model. Research scopes of case study are 9 countries for three different regulation model. The result of case analysis is as followed: as identified by the theoretical contemplation, the lottery policies have been changed by regulation model and policy type about lottery. Prohibit Model deals with a social problem, such as gambling that proliferated before the establishment of governments in islam countries. Alibi Model refers justified policy for the lottery issued for the public welfare countries like USA, Japan, Korea. Risk Model refers to the economic phenomenon after the spread of recent internet technology throughout not only the lottery industry, but also all areas of society and the international game market like UK, Norway and Swissland. As a result of global lottery status analysis based on the review of preceding documents, it was confirmed that the global lottery market has transformed as described by the Risk Model. Under such international environment, the regulation such as annual sales cap contemplated in Korea is believed to be ineffective. The game market is growing day by day and the types of game are also multiplying. The lottery is also becoming an area of entertainment globally, and the global players can freely purchase lotteries of other jurisdictions through the internet. Globalization is no longer an option, but a matter of survival also in the lottery industry. Korea must join the governance of international gaming industry in a variety of perspectives, such as policy, system, culture and so on."
Material feature representation and identification with composite surfacelets,2016,"['Heterogeneous modeling', 'Implicit surface', 'Feature identification', 'Surfacelet transform']",,"Computer-aided materials design requires new modeling approaches to characterize and represent fine-grained geometric structures and material compositions at multiple scales. Recently, a dual-Rep approach was developed to model materials microstructures based on a new basis function, called surfacelet. As a combination of implicit surface and wavelets, surfacelets can efficiently identify and represent planar, cylindrical, and ellipsoidal geometries in material microstructures and describe the distribution of compositions and properties. In this paper, these primitive surfacelets are extended and composite surfacelets are proposed to model more complex geometries. Composite surfacelets are constructed by Boolean operations on the primitives. The surfacelet transform is applied to match geometric features in three-dimensional images. The composition of the material near the identified features can then be modeled. A cubic surfacelet and a v-joint surfacelet are developed to demonstrate the reverse engineering process of retrieving material compositions from material images."

This study addresses the stochastic versions of WTAP, in which data, such as the probability of destroying a target, are given randomly (i.e., data are identified with certain probability distributions). For each type of random data or parameter, we provide a stochastic optimization model on the basis of the expected value or scenario enumeration. In particular, when the probabilities of destroying targets depending on weapons are stochastic, we present a stochastic programming formulation with a simple recourse. We show that the stochastic model can be transformed into a deterministic equivalent mixed integer programming model under a certain discrete probability distribution of randomness. We solve the stochastic model to obtain an optimal solution via the mixed integer programming model and compare this solution with that of the deterministic model."

Thus he anticipates emancipation from dominance if the original form of lifeworld can be restored through reflection, discussion, and communicative action.Planning administering modern society has been guided by the rational planning model that emphasizes means rather than ends. Fundamental problems of such planning practice is that it can be used for justification of human alienation and oppression. Further, the legitimacy of objective knowledge advocated by rational planning theory is no longer valid in the real world. In response, communicative or interpretive planning theory were suggested as a reflective alternatives. This approach views that the knowledge is constructed through the process of social interpretation instead of being acquired by exploring the facts objectively exist in the external world through scientific methods. In this regard, planning is a social process where individual’s thoughts, value, and action are actively constructed.Power supply plan based on instrumental rationality reveals the same problems paralleling to those modernity has entailed. It is focused on efficiency to achieve the external objective of ‘cheap and reliable supply’ rather than reflecting ends or directions of the policy. Decision-making process led by experts rejects other valuesand opinions. Linear planning procedures have limitations in dealing with uncertainty and rationale of objective knowledge becomes unconvinced with distortion by political interests.The implicative policy suggestions from the discussion in electricity planning are proposed as follows: First, public arena for unconstrained discourse is necessary.Second, normative energy scenario should be developed and discussed in this public sphere. Lastly, flexible planning process that emphasizes short-term and incremental development of soft technologies and continuous evaluation and learning are necessary."

However, there is no clear and specific way of selecting a transformation area. Moreover, subdivision of area raises a problems which are mismatch of boundary among conversion districts. This study introduces Thin Plate Spline(TPS) interpolation method, which transforms the cadastral map without any boundary errors. 2D Helmert model which currently used is linear transformation and appropriate to small area where have homogeneous survey results. On the other hand, TPS model can reflects non-homogeneous survey results so that it can be applied to large area.

A feedback type of the functional link artificial neural network (FFLANN) with recursive least square (RLS) training is proposed as a potential prediction model. Comparative performance measures obtained through simulation experiments of Principal component analysis (PCA) and Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based methods for two stock indices demonstrate that the proposed model is a better alternative for prediction of stock indices with respect to several performance measures. For comparison purposes multilayer artificial neural network (MLANN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and support vector machine (SVM) based models are also simulated under similar conditions and it is observed that the proposed model is superior to MLANN, RBFNN and SVM based prediction models. Further, the involvement of low computational complexity and reduced training time of the model will be better suited for online prediction purpose."

To analyze this type of data, one may apply a regression model to log-transformed precipitation data after adding an arbitrarily chosen small positive value to the original data. In this paper, we first show limitations of the log-transformation method through a simulation study. Specifically, the sensitivity of regression coefficient estimate, its standard error and t-statistic to the choice of small positive value added to the original data is investigated. To overcome the limitations, we consider a compound Poisson regression model. Particularly, randomized quantile residuals are used in order to check the distribution assumption and examine the adequacy of the fitted regression model. The availability of the compound Poisson regression model is illustrated by analyzing a real precipitation data of Korean peninsula."

Also, ‘Google Books Libray Project’ is an effort by Google to scan and make searchable the collections of several major research libraries. Bibliographic information and parts of text from a book are often viewable. However, reproduction and display of intellectual properties are inevitable in the use of the page rank and the library project. Unless with the consent of the copyright holder, reproducing or distributing copies lead to infringement of copyright. Therefore, copyright owners which have their works posted on internet, book publishers, and writers argued copyright violation. In the lawsuit, Google counter-argued that reproduction and display of intellectual properties are legal based on fair use. In this paper, standard of judgment on fair use doctrine has been carefully reviewed and analyzed. On deciding the standard of judging fair use doctrine, the United States Court suggested the ‘transformative use doctrine’. The ‘transformative use doctrine’ broadened the use of intellectual properties. Companies like Google which provide internet services largely contributed on extending the business model. Recently, the fair use doctrine has been adopted to Korea from the United States in the process of FTA. There are no cases regarding the fair use doctrine in Korea yet, but it is a matter of grave concern whether the ‘transformative use doctrine’ will be used as the standard of ruling. Furthermore, the adoption of the doctrine may affect internet service companies in Korea to extend its business model like Google. It is worth watching how internet service providers in Korea may grow drastically as Google did with the use of the doctrine."

Following the affect circumplex structure, we measured the valence(positive/negative) and activation(energy expenditure: high and low) of affective states in organization. Therefore, job affect were adopted as variables: positive affect as enthusiasm, pleasantness, and relaxation, negative affect as nervousness, unpleasantness, and fatigue.Survey data collected from 397 employees in a Korean venture was examined by structural equation modeling. The results indicated that transformational leadership had influences on both types of job affect strongly. It was positively associated with positive affect, and negatively with negative affect. The results also showed that the relationships between job affect and organizational effectiveness varied by valence. Positive affect was significantly related with work effort, creative problem-solving, and withdrawal intention. However, negative affect was significantly associated with work effort only. It didn’t show statistically significant effects on other dependent variables. Based on these empirical findings, we discussed theoretical and practical implications for affect management, study limitations, and future research directions."

The virtual aquarium system is composed of multiple texture extraction modules, a single interface module and a single display module. The texture extraction module recognize the QR code on the canvas to get information of the predefined mapping table and then extract the texture data for the corresponding 3D model. The scanned image is segmented and warp transformed onto the texture image by using the mapping information. The extracted texture is transferred to the interface module to save on the server computer and the interface module sends the fish code and texture information to the display module. The display module generates a fish on the virtual aquarium by using predefined 3D model with the transmitted texture. The fishes on the virtual aquarium have three different swimming methods: self-swimming, autonomous swimming, and leader-following swimming. The three different swimming methods are discussed in this paper. The future study will be the implementation of virtual aquarium based on storytelling to further increase interactions with the viewer."

The appearance of an unscented Kalman filter is caused by the linearization process error between a real system and classical Kalman model. The unscented transformation can make a more accurate Kalman model. However, the complexity is its main drawback. This paper investigates the design and implementation of the proposed filter with Potter and Carlson square-root form. The proposed parallel reduced-order square-root unscented Kalman filter reduces memory and code size, and improves numerical computation. And the performance is not significantly different from the unscented Kalman filter. The experimentation is performed for the verification of the proposed filter."
Multicracks identification in beams based on moving harmonic excitation,2016,"['multi-cracks identification', 'wavelet transform', 'differential quadrature method', 'moving harmonic excitation', 'free and forced vibration']",,"A method of damage detection based on the moving harmonic excitation and continuous wavelet transforms is presented. The applied excitation is used as a moving actuator and its frequency and speed parameters can be adjusted for an amplified response. The continuous wavelet transforms, CWT, is used for cracks detection based on the resulting amplified signal. It is demonstrated that this identification procedure is largely better than the classical ones based on eigenfrequencies or on the eigenmodes wavelet transformed. For vibration responses, free and forced vibration analyses of multi-cracked beams are investigated based on both analytical and numerical methodological approaches. Cracks are modeled through rotational springs whose compliances are evaluated using linear elastic fracture mechanics. Based on the obtained forced responses, multi-cracks positions are accurately identified and the CWT identification can be highly improved by adjusting the frequency and the speed excitation parameters."

Energy-Efficient Power Control for Underlaying D2D Communication with Channel Uncertainty: User-Centric Versus Network-Centric,2016,"['Channel uncertainty', 'device-to-device (D2D) communication', 'energy efficiency (EE)', 'network-centric', 'Stackelberg game', 'user-centric']",,"Most existing resource management problem models arise from the original desire of allocating resources in either a user-centric or network-centric manner. The difference between their objectives is obvious: user-centric methods attempt to optimize the utility of individual users, whereas network-centric models intend to optimize the collective utilities of the entire network. In this paper, from the above two aspects, we analyze the robust power control problem in device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular networks, where two types of channel uncertainty set (e.g., ellipsoidal and column-wise) are considered. In the user-centric method, we formulate the problem into the form of a Stackelberg game, where the energy efficiency (EE) of each user is the ingredient of utility function. In order to protect the cellular user equipment's (CUE) uplink transmission, we introduce a price based cost function into the objectives of D2D user equipment (DUE). The existence and uniqueness of the game with the influence of channel uncertainty and price are discussed. In the network-centric method, we aim to maximize the collective EE of CUEs and DUEs. We show that by the appropriate mathematical transformation, the network-centric D2D power control problem has the identical local solution to that of a special case of the user-centric problem, where price plays a key role. Numerical results show the performance of the robust power control algorithms in the user-centric and network-centric models."

Planetary consciousness is the awareness that all beings, energies and phenomena are profoundly interconnected and interdependent. The development toward planetary consciousness can be understood using models such as the Transformative Learning Process, the Radical Forgiveness Method, and the Social Healing Through Justice Model. Progressing through the stages results in openness to multidimensional thinking and knowing. Individuals and communities who have worked through transformative learning processes demonstrate the possibility of genuine healing, reconciliation and the restoration of justice and dignity.

The polyacrylamide was grafted on xanthan gum backbone in the presence of MWCNT. The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized by X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis (FT-IR). The morphological characteristics of the nanocomposite were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses. Also, its temperature resistance property was observed with Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effect of nanocomposite on the rheological properties of the developed drilling fluid system was analyzed with a strain controlled rheometer and Fann viscometer. Flow curves were drawn for the developed water based drilling fluid system at elevated temperatures. The experimental data were fitted to Bingham, power-law, and Herschel Bulkley flow models. It was observed that the Herschel Bulkley flow model predict the flow behavior of the developed system more accurately. Further, nanocomposite exhibited non-Newtonian shear thinning flow behavior in the developed drilling fluid system. Nanocomposite showed high temperature stability and had a significant effect on the rheological properties of the developed drilling fluid system as compared to conventionally used partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PHPA) polymer."

Although the stacking fault energy, calculated using a modified thermodynamic model, slightly decreased with increasing grain size, it was found to vary in a range of $23.4mJ/m^2$ to $27.1mJ/m^2$. Room-temperature tensile test results indicated that the yield and tensile strengths increased; the ductility also improved as the grain size decreased. The increase in the yield and tensile strengths was primarily attributed to the occurrence of mechanical twinning, as well as to the grain refinement effect. On the other hand, the improvement of the ductility is because the formation of deformation-induced martensite is suppressed in the high-manganese steel specimen with small grain size during tensile testing. The deformation-induced martensite transformation resulting from the increased grain size can be explained by the decrease in stacking fault energy or in shear stress required to generate deformation-induced martensite transformation."

This study evaluated natural attenuation processes of TCE at an industrial site in Korea by delineating hydrogeochemical characteristics along the flow path of contaminated groundwater, by calculating reaction rate constants for TCE and its degradation products, and by using geochemical and reactive transport modeling. The monitoring data showed that TCE tended to be transformed to cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-1,2-DCE) and further to vinyl chloride (VC) via microbial reductive dechlorination, although the degree was not too significant. According to our modeling results, the temporal and spatial distribution of the TCE plume suggested the dominant role of biodegradation in attenuation processes. This study can provide a useful method for assessing natural attenuation processes in the aquifer contaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons and can be applied to other sites with similar hydrological, microbiological, and geochemical settings."

This is why in this paper we have examined some high dynamic manoeuvres which are usually a part of automotive tests. Some major issues during these manoeuvres were identified and a modified Kalman filter solution is presented. The problem of positioning of an inertial device within a vehicle is addressed and a transformation of measured data to the centre of gravity (COG) or rotation point (RP) of the vehicle is introduced. We also propose a few methods to identify the start and the stop of a brake test and show distance difference between conventional and modified Kalman algorithm during driving in circles. Finally, a direct and indirect lever-arm correction is introduced and real road tests are made to present an improvement in outputs using one-device sensor setup."

It detects moving objects not only sharply by a pixel-based modeling algorithm, but also robustly against dynamic background by a region-based modeling algorithm. However, it uses a quantized pixel value to reduce computational complexity. For this reason, it is hard to apply the gradient feature (e.g., local binary pattern(LBP) and histogram of oriented gradient(HOG)) which is robust against the light change environment. To solve this problem, we propose an algorithm that detects the moving objects using gradient vector-based MKFC. However, performance of moving object detection can be degraded by the noise resulting from gradient vector-based image transform. In this paper, we propose an improved moving objects detection algorithm using gradient based MKFC. The algorithm uses a median filter for denoising the image from gradient vector-based image transform and determines the candidate region based on similarity estimate. Finally, the approach detects the moving objects by applying a Gaussian filter to the candidate region. Simulation results in a light changing environment show that the proposed algorithm yields better moving-object detecting performance than the conventional algorithm."

Simvastatin Reduces Capsular Fibrosis around Silicone Implants,2016,"['Simvastatin', 'Fibrosis', 'Implant Capsular Contracture']",,"Capsular fibrosis and contracture occurs in most breast reconstruction patients who undergo radiotherapy, and there is no definitive solution for its prevention. Simvastatin was effective at reducing fibrosis in various models. Peri-implant capsular formation is the result of tissue fibrosis development in irradiated breasts. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of simvastatin on peri-implant fibrosis in rats. Eighteen male Sprague- Dawley rats were allocated to an experimental group (9 rats, 18 implants) or a control group (9 rats, 18 implants). Two hemispherical silicone implants, 10 mm in diameter, were inserted in subpanniculus pockets in each rat. The next day, 10-Gy of radiation from a clinical accelerator was targeted at the implants. Simvastatin (15 mg/kg/day) was administered by oral gavage in the experimental group, while animals in the control group received water. At 12 weeks post-implantation, peri-implant capsules were harvested and examined histologically and by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The average capsular thickness was 371.2 μm in the simvastatin group and 491.2 μm in the control group. The fibrosis ratio was significantly different, with 32.33% in the simvastatin group and 58.44% in the control group (P < 0.001). Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 gene expression decreased significantly in the simvastatin group compared to the control group (P < 0.001). This study shows that simvastatin reduces radiation-induced capsular fibrosis around silicone implants in rats. This finding offers an alternative therapeutic strategy for reducing capsular fibrosis and contracture after implant-based breast reconstruction."
Differentiation of Rat Dermal Mesenchymal Cells and Calcification in Three-Dimensional Cultures,2016,"['Three-dimensional culture', 'Dermis', 'Alkaline phosphatase', 'TGF-β', 'Calcification']",,"Three-dimensional (3D) cultures are known to promote cell differentiation. Previously, we investigated the differentiation of rat dermal fibroblasts to α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-positive myofibroblasts through transforming growth factor (TGF)-β production using a 3D culture model. Here, we investigated the phenotypic change from dermal mesenchymal cells (mostly fibroblasts) to osteoblast-like cells, being inspired by the roles of smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts during vascular calcification. Spindle-shaped cells that grew in heterologous populations out of dermal explants from 2-day-old Wistar rats were cultured within a collagen matrix. α-SMA and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels initially increased, followed by a rise in Runx2 and osteocalcin (OCN) mRNA levels without calcification. Calcium deposits were produced in the presence of a high concentration of inorganic phosphate (2.1 mM) or β-glycerophosphate (βGP, 10 mM) after 2 weeks of culture, and both were sensitive to an inhibitor of type III phosphate transporters. An ALP inhibitor decreased only βGP-induced calcification. Inhibition of TGF-β type-I receptors attenuated ALP mRNA levels and βGP-induced calcification, suggesting that endogenous TGF-β stimulates ALP activity and then βGP breakdown. An increase in the number of cells embedded in the collagen gel enhanced the mRNA levels of Runx2 and OCN, but not of ALP. Collectively, several factors are likely to promote the differentiation of dermal mesenchymal cells into osteoblast-like cells and ectopic calcification in a 3D collagen matrix, implying the utility of these cells as a potential autologous cell source for tissue engineering."

Metformin was administered to the mice orally once a day from day 1. We sacrificed half of the mice on day 10 and collected the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from their left lungs. The remaining mice were sacrificed and analyzed on day 21. The right lungs were harvested for histological analyses. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers were determined via analysis of the harvested lungs on day 21. The mice treated with BLM and metformin (50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) showed significantly lower levels of inflammatory cells in the BALF compared with the BLM-only mice on days 10 and 21. The histological examination revealed that the metformin treatment led to a greater reduction in inflammation than the treatment with BLM alone. The mRNA levels of collagen, collagen-1, procollagen, fibronectin, and transforming growth factor-β in the metformin-treated mice were lower than those in the BLM-only mice on day 21, although statistical significance was observed only in the case of procollagen due to the small number of live mice in the BLM-only group. Additionally, treatment with metformin reduced fibrosis to a greater extent than treatment with BLM alone. Metformin suppresses the inflammatory and fibrotic processes of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a murine model.</P>"

The phase image was computed with the use of the software MATLAB and Thermofit Pro using a Fourier transform. The relationship between the coating thickness and the corresponding phase angle was then established with the coating thickness being expressed as a function of the phase angle. The method is successfully applied to measure the coating thickness that varied from 0.25 mm to 1.5 mm."
Metformin Reduces Bleomycin-induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Mice,2016,"['Metformin', 'Bleomycin', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Mice']",,"Metformin has anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. We investigated whether metformin has an inhibitory effect on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a murine model. A total of 62 mice were divided into 5 groups: control, metformin (100 mg/ kg), BLM, and BLM with metformin (50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg). Metformin was administered to the mice orally once a day from day 1. We sacrificed half of the mice on day 10 and collected the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from their left lungs. The remaining mice were sacrificed and analyzed on day 21. The right lungs were harvested for histological analyses. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers were determined via analysis of the harvested lungs on day 21. The mice treated with BLM and metformin (50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) showed significantly lower levels of inflammatory cells in the BALF compared with the BLM-only mice on days 10 and 21. The histological examination revealed that the metformin treatment led to a greater reduction in inflammation than the treatment with BLM alone. The mRNA levels of collagen, collagen-1, procollagen, fibronectin, and transforming growth factor-β in the metformin-treated mice were lower than those in the BLM-only mice on day 21, although statistical significance was observed only in the case of procollagen due to the small number of live mice in the BLM-only group. Additionally, treatment with metformin reduced fibrosis to a greater extent than treatment with BLM alone. Metformin suppresses the inflammatory and fibrotic processes of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a murine model."
Rapid adsorption of cobalt (II) by 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane modified halloysite nanotubes,2016,"['Halloysite Nanotube', '3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane', 'Modification', 'Cobalt', 'Adsorption']",,"The adsorption of cobalt (II) by 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) modified halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) was studied. The modified halloysite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), XRay diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetry (TG). In addition, a batch method was used to study the adsorption behavior and the mechanism of removal Co (II) by modified HNTs; the effective factors influencing the adsorption process including adsorbent concentration, contact time, initial pH, temperature and the initial concentration of Co (II) have been investigated. The results showed that the APTS was successfully grafted on the HNTs surface. The modified HNTs exhibited rapid adsorption speed, which reached the adsorption equilibrium within 30 min. The adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increased significantly with the increase of pH. The adsorption data of Co (II) on the modified HNTs are well consistent with the Langmuir model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model."

First, after close reading of the novel, I propose that the novel is structured as an allegorical parable layered with convoluting main images such as Mongolian mark and flaming tree, etc. implicating their political and aesthetical discourses—vector of devolution, critique of violences in Korean history, contradiction between natural history and human history, and political meaning of absolute refusal of eating. Then, upon this reading, I will thoroughly analyze and compare the orignal text with the translation to find various cases of unintentional mistranslation, liberal translations, or intentional mistranslation conducted through the translator’s such hidden ideologies as orientalism or mere misunderstanding of the original. This analytic comparison reveals that consumer-centered translation model might undermine aesthetic significance of the original. Walter Benjamin also in his “The Task of the Translator” warns against this kind of customer-centered translation model. Rather than presenting a solution, to propose more fundamental thoughts and discussion of translation as such for the future translation of Korean literature, I read through Benjamin’s philosophical understanding of the role of translation."

Fast Prediction Mode Decision in HEVC Using a Pseudo Rate-Distortion Based on Separated Encoding Structure,2016,"['HEVC', 'Video encoding', 'pseudo', 'rate-distortion.']",,"A novel fast algorithm is suggested for a coding unit (CU) mode decision using pseudo rate-distortion based on a separated encoding structure in High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). A conventional HEVC encoder requires a large computational time for a CU mode prediction because prediction and transformation procedures are applied to obtain a rate-distortion cost. Hence, for the practical application of HEVC encoding, it is necessary to significantly reduce the computational time of CU mode prediction. As described in this paper, under the proposed separated encoder structure, it is possible to decide the CU prediction mode without a full processing of the prediction and transformation to obtain a rate-distortion cost based on a suitable condition. Furthermore, to construct a suitable condition to improve the encoding speed, we employ a pseudo rate-distortion estimation based on a Hadamard transformation and a simple quantization. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a 38.68% reduction in the total encoding time with a similar coding performance to that of the HEVC reference model."

The adsorption kinetic data were well elucidated with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated for the uptake of the metal ions under study and it was found to be a spontaneous process. Moreover, the adsorption of metal ions has been studied using column technique. The regeneration of CPN-IDA was experimentally performed by using nitric acid.

Firstly, the initial atmospheric scattering model is transformed to meet the kimmel`s Retinex variational model. Then, the green light component of image is considered as an input of the variational framework, which is generated by the sensitivity of green wavelength. Finally, the atmospheric transmission map is achieved by multi-resolution pyramid reduction to improve the visual effect of the results.

Methods: FT-NIR transmittance spectra in the 1000-2500 nm region were collected for 120 soju samples with fusel oil concentrations ranging from 0 to 1400 ppm. The calibration and validation data sets were designed using data from 75 and 45 samples, respectively. The net analyte signal (NAS) was used as a preprocessing method before the application of the partial least-square regression (PLSR) and principal component regression (PCR) methods for predicting fusel oil concentration. A novel variable selection method was adopted to determine the most informative spectral variables to minimize the effect of nonmodeled interferences. Finally, the efficiency of the developed technique was evaluated with two different validation sets. Results: The results revealed that the NAS-PLSR model with selected variables (R²<sub>v</sub> = 0.95, RMSEV = 100ppm) did not outperform the NAS-PCR model (R²<sub>v</sub>= 0.97, RMSEV = 7 8.9ppm). In addition, the NAS-PCR shows a better recovery for validation set 2 and a lower relative error for validation set 3 than the NAS-PLSR model.

We investigated the effects of TCMG-100 extract on erectile function using in vitro and in vivo studies. Methods: To examine the relaxation effects and mechanisms of action of TCMG-100 on rabbit cavernosal strips evaluated in an organ bath. To investigate the long-term treatment effect of TCMG-100, 8-wk administration was performed. After administration of TCMG-100, intracavernosal pressure, cyclic guanosine monophosphate and nitric oxide (NO) levels of cavernosal tissue, serum testosterone level, histological observation of collagen fiber, endothelium, smooth muscle cell, and transforming growth factor-${\beta}1$ were investigated. Results: TCMG-100 extract displayed dose-dependent relaxation effects on precontracted rabbit corporal smooth muscle. The TCMG-100-induced relaxation was significantly reduced by removing the endothelium, and treatment with an NO synthase inhibitor or NO scavenger. Eight weeks of TCMG-100 administration increased intracavernosal pressure in a rat model. The levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and NO in the corpus callosum and serum testosterone level were also increased by TCMG-100 treatment. Furthermore, histological evaluation of collagen, smooth muscle, and endothelium showed increases in endothelium and smooth muscle, and a decrease in transforming growth factor-${\beta}1$ expression. Conclusion: These relaxation effects on corporal smooth muscle and increased erectile function suggest that TCMG-100 might be used as an alternative herbal medicine to improve erectile function."
초음파 도플러 신호를 이용한 음성 합성,2016,[],,"In this paper, a method synthesizing speech signal using the 40 kHz ultrasonic signals reflected from the articulatory muscles was introduced and performance was evaluated.

These ADS (Acoustic-Doppler Signals) were used for estimating of the speech parameters in this study. Prior to synthesizing speech signal, a quantitative correlation analysis between ADS and speech signals was carried out on each frequency bin. According to the results, the feasibility of the ADS-based speech synthesis was validated. ADS-to-speech transformation was achieved by the joint Gaussian mixture model-based conversion rules. The experimental results from the 5 subjects showed that filter bank energy and LPC (Linear Predictive Coefficient) cepstrum coefficients are the optimal features for ADS, and speech, respectively.

Asset specificity and capability of e-Trade performance: evidence from Korea,2016,"['Performance', 'Dynamic capability', 'E-Trade', 'Exporting firms', 'Asset specificity']",,"Purpose – E-Trade (paperless trade or cross-border e-commerce in B2B format) does not necessarily show positive results. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize why and how such happens and furthermore, has two research purposes. First is to explain why studies in e-Trade performance show controversial results, such as some showing positive while others are not. Second is to investigate the relationship among research constructs such as e-Trade benefits, e-Trade use, asset specificity, and exporting firm’s capability.Design/methodology/approach – This study considers multiple dimensions and evolutionary perspective of e-Trade performance. Structural equation model adopts the measures of firm’s capability, e-Trade use, and benefits to analyze e-Trade performance. Performance was divided into organizational net benefits (ONB) and industrial net benefits. Several hypotheses were suggested to test the relationship among the variables in the model. Basic moderator effect represented as an interaction between asset specificity and other constructs. In total, 295 exporting firms have participated in the survey and their responses were utilized for analysis.Findings – This study shows that e-Trade performance should consider maturity as well as multiple stages among constructs. Critical paths were found among capability factors, process use (PU), ONB, and asset specificity. Results also show that information capability and marketing capability (MC) are determinant factors on e-Trade performance. In addition, MC and level of PU are read to be determinant factors of ONB. Furthermore, small and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs’) asset specificity, with level of capability and e-Trade use moderates their e-Trade performance.Research limitations/implications – Asset specificity of SMEs has to be managed in a positive direction. Government’s e-Trade supporting programs for SMEs should be transformed in a way that can foster the growth of capability and self-sustainment. It reads to be inevitable to amend the current characteristics of e-Trade services. Furthermore, developing a specialized e-Trade service for large firms will also be in need. And utilizing exporting firm’s financial data would be more advisable testing the hypotheses.Originality/value – Most works in information system as well as in e-Trade area report controversial performance results and this paper suggests an alternative model by combining asset specificity into capability and e-Trade use. Study on e-Trade performance is complicated and needs to consider multiple dimensions as well as their stages. This study envisions firm’s capability, asset specificity and at the same time contributes in e-Trade benefits."

This kind of green growth policy is far from the model of sustainable development, and rather seems to be the exiting developmentalism strategies and dispossession on nature by enclosure. Does not seem to be promoting renewables energies under the ideology of green growth policy is permitted solve environmental and energy issues and to address the sustainable development of supreme order."
Degradation of ultrahigh concentration pollutant by Fe/Cu bimetallic system at high operating temperature,2016,"['Operating Temperature', 'High Concentration Pollutant', 'Fe/Cu Bimetallic Particles', 'Wastewater Treatment']",,"To investigate the degradation of high concentration pollutant by Fe/Cu bimetallic system at a high operating temperature, 10,000mg/L acid orange 7 (AO7) aqueous solution was treated by Fe/Cu bimetallic system at 80 oC.First, the effect of the operating temperature (30-80 oC) on the reactivity of Fe/Cu bimetallic particles was investigated thoroughly. Then, the studies on the effect of theoretical Cu mass loading, Fe/Cu dosage, stirring speed and initial pH on the reactivity of Fe/Cu bimetallic particles at a high temperature (i.e., 80 oC) were carried out, respectively. The degradation and transformation process of AO7 was studied by using COD, TOC and UV-Vis spectra. The results indicate that high concentration pollutant could be removed effectively by Fe/Cu bimetallic system at a high operating temperature. And the removal efficiencies of AO7 by Fe/Cu bimetallic system were in accordance with the pseudofirst- order model. Finally, it was observed that the high temperature could accelerate mass transport rate and overcome the high activation energy barrier to significantly improve the reactivity of Fe/Cu bimetallic particles. Therefore, the higher removal efficiency could be obtained by Fe/Cu system at a high operating temperature. Thus, the high operating temperature played a leading role in the degradation of high concentration pollutant."

One of the most prominent painters who made a constant effort to defend and revitalise Chinese painting amid Western domination in the early and mid-twentieth century, he was deeply concerned with the issue of how to explore a new creative territory within the Chinese ink and brush tradition. Fu Baoshi was born in the last years of the Qing dynasty(1644-1912) when China was going through unprecedented turmoil and transformation. Despite his humble background, his diverse experiences from an early age, including his frequent visits to the mounting and seal carving shops, his education at the newly established modern school, his teaching experiences, his identity as an artist and his overseas study with the help of Xu Beihong(1895-1953), all combined to play a significant role in his individual artistic pursuit as well as his responsibility as an artist representing his country.  This paper focuses on Fu Baoshi’s studies in Japan from 1932 to 1935 and explores the role this experience played as a catalyst for him to rethink the nature of Chinese art and its tradition, providing him with an opportunity to enlarge his artistic horizons. On 5th September 1932, Fu Baoshi went to Japan under a Chinese government scholarship to carry out research into Japanese arts and crafts with the aim of helping to improve the Jingdezhen ceramic industry. During his first year in Tokyo, his observation of Japan’s promotion of arts and crafts and protection of the country’s artistic heritage motivated him to urge the Chinese government to learn from Japan. By visiting art schools, galleries and museums, Fu Baoshi learnt about the Japanese government’s systemic institutionalisation of art and its promotion of art exhibitions and art associations, in particular the significance of national treasures and the importance of preserving them, at the same time increasing his sense of national mission as an artist.  During his second year as a post-graduate student at the Imperial School of Fine Arts in Tokyo(Teikoku bijutsu gakkō, 帝国美術学校; today Musashino Art University), Fu Baoshi concentrated on training in the history of art under the supervision of his Japanese professor Kinbara Seigo(金原省吾, 1888-1958). As such, this paper also investigates how Fu Baoshi engaged with art historical research on Chinese art through the lens of Japanese scholarship and rediscovered and reinterpreted the Chinese art tradition by analysing his own writings and other related Japanese articles. He developed his knowledge on Chinese painting through the Japanese scholarship, particularly on the Eastern Jin painter Gu Kaizhi, Tang and Song painting, and the later Ming painter Shitao, thus broadening his perspective on Chinese painting traditions as well as exerting an impact on his own individual style of painting which he was able to establish in the 1940s.  First, inspired by Kinbara Seigo’s studies, Fu Baoshi started researching the history of ‘lines; in Chinese painting and developed his scholarly interest in Gu Kaizhi. Taking Gu Kaizhi’s Admonitions Scroll as a technical model, he later established his personal style of figure painting depicting female figures. Second, having studied Tang and Song painting through his Japanese professor, he tried to analyse Chinese painting history from the perspective of the painting substance such as ‘line’, ‘colour’ and ‘ink’ as well as technique, with emphasis on the use of brushwork and ink. As well as realising the importance of the works by Chan monks of the Southern Song in terms of Chinese painting history, he was attracted to the monks’ dramatic treatment of ink and their experimentation with ink tonality which became sources of inspiration for his landscape paintings after he returned from Japan. Third, inspired by the Japanese scholarship on Shitao"

The PAPDM hydrogels were prepared by the simple free radical polymerization of monomers acrylamide, dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate and 1-acryloyl-3-phenyl thiourea.The free radical initiator used for this study was ammonium persulphate and the cross-linker was ethylene glycol di methacrylate. The swelling study of the PAPDM hydrogels were performed in the aqueous environment to calculate the morphological parameters, such as the volume fraction in a swollen gel (v2m), polymer-solvent interaction parameter (χ) and molecular weight between the crosslinks (Mc). These hydrogels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. Further these chelating hydrogels were investigated for the removal of rare earth metal ions (samarium and terbium) from aqueous environments by varying the adsorption time, adsorbate concentration and monomer ratio. The adsorption time data for samarium and terbium were fitted to two simple kinetic models, pseudo-first and pseudo-second-order, and tested to examine the adsorption mechanisms. The kinetic parameters were calculated. The equilibrium data was fitted well to the Langmuir and Freundlich models."

The terminal velocity, DSD and two forms of kinetic energy(KE, Jm<sup>-2</sup> mm<sup>-1</sup>; KER, Jm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> ) of open rainfall drops were determined and were compared with those of throughfall drops under two different canopy heights. The effects of the canopy and rainfall intensity, together with wind speed, on the changes in drop size and kinetic energy of throughfall were evaluated. Throughfall drops were larger than open rainfall drops. The distribution of terminal velocities for the drop sizes measured at Th2 was lower than that at Op; however, at Th1 the distribution was similar to that at Op. The total kinetic energy of throughfall at Th1 and Th2 was higher than the total kinetic energy of open rainfall, and the kinetic energy distribution for the drop sizes was similar to the drop size distribution. The observed throughfall-KER at Th1 was lower than an estimate previously produced using a model. The overestimation from the modeled value at Th1 was likely to be due to overestimated values of a square root transformation of fall height and its coefficient in the model because the distributions of terminal velocity for the drop size measured at Th1 were similar to those of open rainfall."

Whenexamined words created in our daily lives, this study discovered that many of them are far from the word-formation education of school grammar. Thus, this study intends to propose the necessity of introducing cognitive grammar perspectives to the school grammar education.  All the studies on Korean words can be mostly divided into three flows, traditional grammar, structuralism and transformational generative grammar. Having been established with such flows, the Korean school grammar accepts an eclectic system that includes particles in words, but excludes endings from words. In other words, there are some opinions that both particles and endings should be recognized as words, and other opinions that neither of them should be excluded from words, so this system makes a compromise between them and is selected for the sake of grammar description. From this perspective, a new linguistic research flow should be reflected, but the concept of words has not changed at all. Therefore, it is necessary to reflect cognitive grammar, a usage-based model.  Cognitive grammar pursues bottom-up principles. In this aspect, words are regarded as structured inventory of conventional linguistic units. With such a concept of words adopted, this study insists that it is needed to introduce even ‘Wordization of Syntactic Construction’, beyond the present school grammar that has dual perspectives on compound words as ‘Compound’ and ‘Derivation’. The present school grammar concept of words has changed from a perspective of composition to a perspective of formation. Even the perspective of word formation has been comprehended from a perspective of rule. Recently, however, Korean word formation is explained not with rules but as a cognitive process called ‘Inference’. Therefore, this study found it necessary to introduce cognitive grammar perspectives to the present Korean grammar education."

It can be said that it is considered as an important space expressing the identity of the city, and it has both sides as a complex space of interests. Because the old city center of a large city is a space that has been formed for a long time, it should be approached carefully in terms of development or new policy establishment. As a result of this difficulty, the existing urban areas of some cities eventually fall into a backward space and decrease the competitiveness of the whole city . As a result, the settlement of the problems in the old city center and the setting of the direction are the same problem as the whole city is determined to go forward in the situation where the expansion of the physical city is weakened. The old downtown of Daegu Metropolitan City is a place where historical facts and values of historical space coexist and permanently link past, present and future. The purpose of this study is to analyze the actual state of conservation and utilization of Gyeongsang Gamyeong, which is located in Jung-gu, Daegu Metropolitan City, as a representative historical spatial resource, and to identify the land use and real estate situation in the surrounding area We will develop a urban renewal model. It is considered that the urban regeneration should be transformed into a space of coexistence that connects the past, present and future with insufficient preservation of the buildings. Therefore, the possibility of utilization of urban regeneration and creative urban development centered on historical and cultural space resources was examined. This study examines the possibility of utilizing the existing urban regeneration system and the utilization of historical space as a catalyst for the activation of various types of urban and central urban areas, and proposes a new model for urban regeneration."

In doing so, I try to understand how the changes in labor migration are linked with those in East Asia as a region and how they have affected each other.After World War Ⅰ, as entering and settling in the receiving countries became increasingly difficult, labor migration through short-term contracts emerged as a major phenomenon. However, short-term labor contracts often led to prolonged stay or settlement, depending on the needs and desires of the migrants or those of the receiving countries. This was where the dilemma of labor migration lay, much the same as today’s many problems stemming from global migration.Labor migration during the colonial period consisted mainly of forced mobilization of individual laborers into the original country and the mass migration of family units into Machuria as a colonization policy. But later, during the Cold War period, labor migration largely took the form of offshore migration of individual laborers to Germany and the Middle East region. This change signalled a transition into a postcolonial and developmentalist model of labor migration. It also meant that the grand division of the East Asian region was fundamentally restricting inshore labor migration.On the other hand, since the collapse of the Cold War and sweeping globalization, offshore migration has been decreasing while inshore migration has been on the rise, and the East Asian region is finding itself more and more on the receiving end of migration. These are clear signs of the post-Cold War and global era that we are in. Nevertheless, the oversees dispatch of North Korean laborers continues to grow, as does the migration of ethnic Koreans in China into Korea, lending a prognosis of the diasporic changes to come out of North Korea’s social transformation. It can therefore be said that the North Korean defectors into South Korea are carrying out the role of a litmus test of diasporic labor migration."

The volume fractions of martensitic transformation have been measured by the magnetic tester of Fischer Model MP3C. It has been shown that the calculated stress-strain curve and the volume fractions of martensitic transformation are in agreement with those obtained from experimental measurements, demonstrating that the material constants found by using the stress-strain curve can capture the underlying materials science of deformation. On this basis, the influence of twins, martensitic transformation, and mechanical behavior of austenite and martensite on the strength and plasticity of the 304 stainless steel has been discussed further."

This paper presents the physical mechanisms and experimental researches on partial discharge (PD) of oil-paper insulation at pulsating DC voltage. Theoretical analysis showed that the phase-resolved distributions of PDs generated from different insulated models varied as the increase of the applied voltages following a certain rule. Four artificial insulation defect models were designed to generate PD signals at pulsating DC voltages. Theoretical statements and experimental results show that the PD pulses first appear at the maximum value of the applied pulsating DC voltage, and the resolved PD phase distribution became wider as the applied voltage increased. The PD phase-resolved distributions generated from the different discharge models are also different in the phase-resolved distributions and development progress. It implies that the theoretical analysis is suitable for interpretation of PD at pulsating DC voltage."
개혁기 중국 동북지역 사회관리체제의 변화- 다롄 사구의 건설과 거버넌스 문제를 중심으로,2016,"['shequ', 'typical danwei system', 'society-led model', 'Dalian', 'autonomy']",,"Focusing on Dalian city, this paper analyzes the process of the deconstruction of danwei system which was made in the socialist era and the emergence of shequ which has superseded danwei in the reform era. The danwei system which has existed in the Northeast region of China is called typical danwei system, because the typicality of danwei system was much more prominent, compared with those of the other regions. With the deconstruction of danwei system, there has been formed a society-led shequ model in Dalian, a city of heavy industries in the Northeast region. This paper argues that the formation of society-led shequ model does not necessarily signify that the state has granted some autonomy to the society or the society has acquired some autonomy from the state in the reform era. Rather, this paper argues that the model means that the historical legacies of typical danwei system has influenced the transformations of social management system. In other words, socioeconomic protection was given to people by danwei (not by the state) in the socialist era, and with the deconstruction of danwei, shequ has emerged to give that protection to people in place of danwei. Hence, the seeming autonomy of society-led shequ model to the state should be analyzed in consideration of the historical legacies of typical danwei system which still has some influences in this region."
U(1) Chiral Symmetry in a One-Dimensional Interacting Electron System with Spin,2016,"['Tomonaga-Luttinger model', 'Critical line', 'Fermi-Bose Equivalence', 'Renormalization group flow', 'Chiral symmetry']",,"We study a spin-dependent Tomonaga-Luttinger model in one dimension, which describes electron transport through a single barrier. Using the Fermi-Bose equivalence in one dimension, we map the model onto a massless Thirring model with a boundary interaction. A field theoretical perturbation theory for the model has been developed, and the chiral symmetry is found to play an important role. The classical bulk action possesses a global UA(1)4 chiral symmetry because the fermion fields are massless. This global chiral symmetry is broken by the boundary interaction, and the bosonic degrees of freedom, corresponding to a chiral phase transformation, become dynamical. They acquire an additional kinetic action from the fermion path-integral measure and govern the critical behaviors of the physical operators. On the critical line where the boundary interaction becomes marginal, they decouple from the fermi fields. Consequently, the action reduces to the free-field action, which contains only a fermion bilinear boundary mass term as an interaction term. By using a renormalization group analysis, we obtain a new critical line, which differs from the previously known critical lines in the literature. The result of this work implies that the phase diagram of the one-dimensional electron system may have a richer structure than previously thought."
Content Based Dynamic Texture Analysis and Synthesis Based on SPIHT with GPU,2016,"['Discrete Wavelet Transform', 'Dynamic Texture', 'GPU', 'SPIHT', 'SVD']",,"Dynamic textures are videos that exhibit a stationary property with respect to time (i.e., they have patterns that repeat themselves over a large number of frames). These patterns can easily be tracked by a linear dynamic system.

Content based threshold filtering based on Set Partitioning in a Hierarchical Tree (SPIHT) helps to get another representation of the same frames that only have low frequency components. The main idea of this paper is to apply SPIHT based threshold filtering on different bands of wavelet transform so as to have more significant information in fewer parameters for singular value decomposition (SVD). In this case, more flexibility is given for the component selection, as SVD is independently applied to the different bands of frames of a dynamic texture. To minimize the time complexity, the proposed model is implemented on a graphics processing unit (GPU). Test results show that the proposed dynamic system, along with a discrete wavelet and SPIHT, achieve a highly compact model with better visual quality, than the available LDS, Fourier descriptor model, and higher-order SVD (HOSVD)."

The principles of unscented transformation and unscented Kalman filter are examined and their applications are explained. Typically the mapping transformation process is divided into two types, namely the basic unscented transformation and the general unscented transformation by virtue of the scaling parameter value. And resultantly, the number of sampling points, weights, code configuration and computation time are different. But there is no little information on the scaling parameter value or how this value influences the system performance. To analyze the unscented transformation with the various scaling parameters in this study, the experimental results under a wide range of operation condition have been demonstrated."

According to René Girard's 'Triangle of the Desire', the subject in narrative of Metamorphosis-motif, comes to be same with the mediator, imitating Médiateur du Désir in order to be same with desiring object, or can be seen completing transformation, coexisting the subject and mediator in a single body. At this time, the transformed body has the formative features of hybrid combining the double forms. The cinema audiences understood the meaning of desire by translating the formative features of this transformed body as the symbolic metaphor to the subject’s desire. In this process, the formative features of transformed character, making the mediator’s capability as mine by combining the subject’s capability with the mediator’s one, creates narrative of Metamorphosis-motif as like happy ending.

Following the self-determination theory, autonomous motivation is defined as three types: intrinsic motivation, integrated motivation, and identified motivation. Adopted are job characteristics and transfor-mational leadership as the antecedents of autonomous motivation. The five job characteristics are measured at the individual level, while transformational leadership is operationalized at the group level in terms of three components: vision sharing, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration. The leadership variables are hypothesized to exert cross-level influences on autonomous motivation. The three types of autonomous motivation are expected to result in active performance behaviors, such as time input, work intensity, and creative problem-solving. We selected an IT venture company in Korea and surveyed all employee members of the company, thus obtaining 417 respondents from 37 teams. To test the research model, multilevel structural equations modeling was conducted by using Mplus 7.4. The advantage of Multi-level SEM is to allow us to examine all linkages among the variables of the multi-level model simultaneously. The results showed that all three types of autonomous motivation were positively related to task significance at individual-level and the vision sharing of transformational leadership at group-level. Job autonomy exerted positive effect on intrinsic motivation, and job feedback showed positive relationship with identified motivation. By contrast, no significant effect were found for task identity, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration. Each of the autonomous motivation differed in the significant relationships with performance behaviors. Identified motivation was strongly associated with all performance behaviors. Integrated motivation was related to time input and work intensity, while intrinsic motivation showed significant relationship with time input and creative problem-solving. Theoretical and managerial implications are sought from the empirical findings. The limitations and future research directions are also discussed."

Particularly, the cultural level among the western and eastern provinces is a big difference of degree, and the Romanization in these areas may be discriminatory. Therefore, the Roman empire not executed in a uniform manner the Romanization of western and eastern provinces and applied the Romanization in a different way according to the degree of cultural level in these areas. Then, Augustus tried to restore the existing culture of high standard as a goal of Romanization in the eastern provinces and to aim at the establishment of new order basing on the Romanization in the western provinces.  Although the Romanization of provinces in the Roman empire showed the difference among the western and eastern provinces, this grew from not the distinction cultural level but the locational difference considering that the Roman empire put the peace above the cultural propagation. Also, the Romanization of provinces could be divided into the theory of province-oriented bottom up and the theory of empire-oriented top down. However, this cannot be concluded from one side view. Therefore, it is desirable to understand the Romanization of provinces basing on two mixed theory. In light of this view, the roll of elites is important for the Romanization of provinces. While the Roman empire zeroed in on the order and the peace of provinces and tried to spread the Roman lifestyle by luring the elites of provinces, the elites of provinces expressed inherent factors which interacted with the roman culture. The elites of provinces granted the Roman citizenship in reward for official business and achieved the legal and economic privilege. The Roman citizenship eradicated the differentiation of the ruler and the governed and the elites of provinces progressed to the elites of Roman empire.  In this way, the elites of provinces created the new culture through the Romanization. Ultimately, many elites regarded themselves as Romans. The loyalty of provincial elites for the Roman empire not surprised. Because the tolerance in Roman empire considered the morality and the cultural heritage of province as the culture of new empire. In the cultural level of province, this transformation is the product of negotiation between the practical objective of Rome to reduce administrative expense and the aspiration of provincial elites. Because the new system to create acculturation elevated the social status of provincial elites. The ostentation of their fame acted as the important motive in order to apply new ideas and objectives."

FWI can update velocity as reducing the residual between the observed and estimated data which can be obtained by solving wave equation. Therefore, when we carry out 2D FWI with 3D data acquired in a field, critical problems happen in FWI, because 2D and 3D wave equations have different green functions. To overcome the problem we suggest 2D plane-wave FWI method using plane-wave gathers, which are transformed from 3D data, as observed data.Since plane-wave data follow 1D green function, the differences of amplitude and phase do not occur, it means that we can implement FWI by using different dimension data. In addition, this method has advantage that computational cost is considerably reduced. To verifythe validity of this method, we applied it to 3 layer model and 3D SEG/EAGE overthrust model and obtained reasonable inversion results."

The physical and chemical properties of AC and surface-modified AC (AC-K800) were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and phenol adsorption was characterized using Freundlich and Langmuir model equations. The phenol adsorption efficiency of AC-K800 was significantly improved above 97% of initial concentration(50mg/L) by pre-treatment. The maximum adsorption capacity (44.40 mg/g) of phenol by AC-K800 was observed at a slightly acidic condition (pH 4). From the kinetic experiment results, it was shown that the adsorption equilibrium was attained after 360 mins. The kinetic data showed good fitting with the pseudo first and second order models (R2 >0.990). The equilibrium adsorption of phenol well fitted by the Langmuir model and the adsorption capacity was 326.55 mg/g. From these results, it was concluded that AC-K800, as a pretreated absorbent, can be successfully applied to remove phenol from the aqueous solution."

For the estimation of marginal models we consider a class of time-varying transformation models and combine the two marginal models using nonparametric empirical copulas. Regression parameters in the transformation model can be obtained as the solution of estimating equations and our models and estimation method can be applied in many situations where the conditional mean-based models are not good enough. Nonparametric copulas combined with time-varying transformation models may allow quite flexible modeling for the joint conditional distributions for bivariate longitudinal data. We apply our method to an epidemiological study of repeatedly measured bivariate cholesterol data.

Safety Analysis of Structures with Probability and Evidence Theory,2016,"['safety analysis', 'epistemic uncertainty', 'evidence theory', 'probability theory']",,"In safety analysis of structures, classical probabilistic analysis has been a popular approach in engineering. However, it is not always to obtain sufficient information to model all uncertain parameters of structures system by probability theory, especially at early stage of design. Under this circumstance, probability theory (used to model random uncertainty) combined with evidence theory (used to model epistemic uncertainty) may be utilized in safety analysis of structures. This paper proposed a novel method for safety analysis of structures based on probability and evidence theory. Firstly, Bayes conversion method is used as the way for precision of evidence body, and the mean and variance of epistemic uncertain variables is defined. Then epistemic uncertainty variables is transformed to normal random variables by reflection transformation method, and the checking point method (J-C method) is used to solve most probability point and reliability. A numerical example and two engineering examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show both precision and computational efficiency of the method is high. Moreover, the proposed method provides basis for reliability-based optimization with the hybrid uncertainties."

This study conducts an empirical analysis on how two distinctive military systems, voluntary system vs. conscription, exert different influences on organizational performance. The research question addresses whether the type of military system creates any behavior differences of soldiers. The proposed structural equation model suggests that soldiers’ organizational commitment is affected directly by the type of military system and indirectly through the levels of job stress and combat competency. The data for the empirical analysis was collected from a survey conducted to 292 soldiers serving in either a Special Forces Brigade (a voluntary military unit) or a Special Assault Commando Regiment (a conscription unit). No statistically significant evidence supports the direct influence of military system type on the level of organizational commitment. Yet, serving in a voluntary military unit is found to decrease the solider’s stress and reinforces military competency, and further improve organizational commitment indirectly. This finding may imply that reducing work stress and enhancing combat competency by improving the soldiers’ quality of life, which is typically better in voluntary military units, can be as important as transforming the military system itself."
Partial Discharge Process and Characteristics of Oil-Paper Insulation under Pulsating DC Voltage,2016,"['Convert transformer', 'Partial discharge property', 'Oil-paper insulation', 'Pulsating DC voltage', 'Discharge procedure']",,"Oil-paper insulation of valve-side windings in converter transformers withstand electrical stresses combining with AC, DC and strong harmonic components.

Theoretical analysis showed that the phase-resolved distributions of PDs generated from different insulated models varied as the increase of the applied voltages following a certain rule. Four artificial insulation defect models were designed to generate PD signals at pulsating DC voltages. Theoretical statements and experimental results show that the PD pulses first appear at the maximum value of the applied pulsating DC voltage, and the resolved PD phase distribution became wider as the applied voltage increased. The PD phase-resolved distributions generated from the different discharge models are also different in the phase-resolved distributions and development progress. It implies that the theoretical analysis is suitable for interpretation of PD at pulsating DC voltage."

Corn silage samples (n=407) were collected from cattle farms and feed companies in Korea between 2014 and 2015. Samples of silage were scanned at 1 nm intervals over the wavelength range of 680~2,500 nm. The optical data were recorded as log 1/Reflectance (log 1/R) and scanned in intact fresh condition. The spectral data were regressed against a range of chemical parameters using partial least squares (PLS) multivariate analysis in conjunction with several spectral math treatments to reduce the effect of extraneous noise. The optimum calibrations were selected based on the highest coefficients of determination in cross validation ($R^2{_{cv}}$) and the lowest standard error of cross validation (SECV). Results of this study revealed that the NIRS method could be used to predict chemical constituents accurately (correlation coefficient of cross validation, $R^2{_{cv}}$, ranging from 0.77 to 0.91). The best mathematical treatment for moisture and crude protein (CP) was first-order derivatives (1, 16, 16, and 1, 4, 4), whereas the best mathematical treatment for neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) was 2, 16, 16. The calibration models for fermentation parameters had lower predictive accuracy than chemical constituents. However, pH and lactic acids were predicted with considerable accuracy ($R^2{_{cv}}$ 0.74 to 0.77). The best mathematical treatment for them was 1, 8, 8 and 2, 16, 16, respectively.

To avoid the parallel resonance of the LCL topology, the active damping method of the proportional capacitor-current feedback is employed. As to current vector error elimination, an optimized PR controller of the inner current loop is proposed with the zero-pole matching (ZPM) and cancellation method to configure the regulator. The impacts on system’s characteristics and stability margin caused by the PR controller and control parameter variations in the inner-current loop are analyzed, and the correlations among active damping feedback coefficient, sampling and transport delay, and system robustness have been established. An equivalent model of the inner current loop is studied via the pole-zero locus along with the pole placement method and frequency response characteristics. Then, the parameter values of the control system are chosen according to their decisive roles and performance indicators. Finally, simulation and experimental results obtained while adopting the proposed method illustrated its feasibility and effectiveness, and the inner current loop achieved zero static error tracking with a good dynamic response and steady-state performance."

An Inductance Voltage Vector Control Strategy and Stability Study Based on Proportional Resonant Regulators under the Stationary αβ Frame for PWM Converters,2016,"['Active damping', 'Inductance voltage vector', 'Pole-zero matching', 'Proportional resonant regulator', 'Stability']",,"The mathematical model of a three phase PWM converter under the stationary αβ reference frame is deduced and constructed based on a Proportional-Resonant (PR) regulator, which can replace trigonometric function calculation, Park transformation, real-time detection of a Phase Locked Loop and feed-forward decoupling with the proposed accurate calculation of the inductance voltage vector. To avoid the parallel resonance of the LCL topology, the active damping method of the proportional capacitor-current feedback is employed. As to current vector error elimination, an optimized PR controller of the inner current loop is proposed with the zero-pole matching (ZPM) and cancellation method to configure the regulator. The impacts on system's characteristics and stability margin caused by the PR controller and control parameter variations in the inner-current loop are analyzed, and the correlations among active damping feedback coefficient, sampling and transport delay, and system robustness have been established. An equivalent model of the inner current loop is studied via the pole-zero locus along with the pole placement method and frequency response characteristics. Then, the parameter values of the control system are chosen according to their decisive roles and performance indicators. Finally, simulation and experimental results obtained while adopting the proposed method illustrated its feasibility and effectiveness, and the inner current loop achieved zero static error tracking with a good dynamic response and steady-state performance."

A growing body on diversity research has focused the positive or negative effects of objective diversity using heterogeneity index on team performance and exam-ined how diversity itself affected result variables and focused in how such causality was changed and by which factors. However, in spite of this effort, previous studies have shown conflicting result for the effect of diversity. Because people tend to behave positively or negatively according to their perception and awareness towards difference not to diversity per se. Even in a team whose members objectively vary greatly in their attributes, the effect of diversity can vary depending on how the team members respond to the presence of diversity. In this vein, we test and compare the effect of transformational leadership and shared leadership as an important antecedent of diversity attitude. And we also test the moderating effect of non-differential treatment which is formed by a collective attitude of a team where non-discriminating treatment for the characteristics of a colleague`s different background rather than their actions. In a team where an tolerant attitude towards diversity is displayed, this attitude would positively affect individual`s diversity attitude. We adopt multi-level analysis using hierarchical linear modeling in order to verify the effect of two leaderships on diversity attitude and employees` behaviors at individual level and the moderating effect of non-differential treatment at team level respectively. A total of 761 members in 121 teams who work in several industries constituted the sample of this study. Findings of our analysis showed that only shared leaderships had a positive effect on positive diversity attitude. However, we found the significant moderation effect of team`s non-differential treatment by transformational leader-ship on diversity attitude. The finding also indicated that diversity attitude had a positive effect on extra-role behavior and a negative effect on counter-productive work behavior. Based on these findings, we recom-mend that team based organizations should work on providing the substantial support of various realistic diversity training related to employees` attitude towards diversity. It is also advisable for organizations to encourage in-house social programs, aside from official training programs, so that the employees can accept diversity more naturally. And it is worthwhile to check team-level perceptions of diversity for proactive management in practice because the capabilities for sustainable management and success ultimately come from human resource. Lastly we recommended to find another antecedent of positive diversity attitude and another convergent mechanism that could boost the effect of leadership on diversity attitude. We discussed managerial and practical implications of our findings in details."

한국교회의 새로운 패러다임으로써 선교적 교회에 대한 연구,2016,"['선교적 교회', '다문화 사회', '가정교회', '다음세대', '비지니스선교', 'Missional Church', 'Multi-cultural Society', 'House Church', 'Next Generation', 'Business as Mission']",,"Korea is currently rapidly transforming into a multi-cultural society through changes in political, economic, military, educational, religious and cultural factors which factor into larger global change. Such transformations in Korean society are directly and indirectly influencing the church. As a result, internal and external changes in the church call for a new paradigm both theology and ecclesiology. In other words, the Korean church must seek out a new model that could transform both the old and new generations. The situation in Korean society requires such a change. When one examines its history, the Korean church has been on a downhill slide since 1995, and today, the church has become noticeably weakened. In addition, evidence shows that the public shows the least amount of trust, average positive feelings towards Christianity relative to other religions, and the church exercised the lowest amount of influence. On the other hand, research also shows that the church performs the most amount of community service. Firstly, it is necessary to take a look at the characteristics of the social changes that call for the transformation of the church into a more missional paradigm. The first characteristic of Korea’s cultural change that is relevant to missional ecclesiology is that Korea is quickly becoming a multi-cultural society. Secondly, the Korean youth are becoming what experts call the Sampo Generation (the generation that gave up 3 things that make one an adult; dating, marriage, and having children) or the Chilpo Generation (the generation that gave up 7 things; dating, marriage, having children, buying a home, human relations, one``s dream and even hope). Thirdly, Korea is going through serious levels of aging. Lastly, we have entered an age of change with regards of competition amongst corporations and management. In short, the nations in the middle of rapid transformation, and because all these social changes are progressing at such a rapid pace, the church is showing difficulty in keeping up. The resulting reality is churches whose influence on society has been deteriorating and a growing number of young men and women that lose interest and leave their respective communities. In order to fulfill the Great Commission, the church must take up its calling for mission, and in order to do so, the church must be reformed into a new missional ecclesiology which is capable of bringing about change, and embraces the new era. Then what must this new missional ecclesiological paradigm look like? The Korean church must first be a community that is centered round love and God, that keeps worship service, evangelizes to prospective customers, continues onto the next generation, is a communal church which is rooted in the domestic church, which focuses on BAM (Business as Mission), reforms multi-cultural society, and makes disciples of all nations. The reason why we cannot see fruit despite knowing all the principles of the missional church and we put them into action is because we have not been properly trained and educated. Therefore, the Korean church must put heavy emphasis on action and put more effort into training and education for missional theology, missional ecclesiology and a missional ministry."

Cinematizing pansori editorial 『Chunhyangjeon』is extra work because the movie reconstructs the past event and at the same time, it should not give up communicating with the present. In terms of the reconstruction of the past, < ChunHyang > can be seen as a great success. Rebuilding the past in present perspectives is impossible in the abstractive approach. To do so, it should proceed to comprehend the classical narratives and thoroughly understand modern media as a reinvention of classical narratives. < ChunHyang > discovered contexts of classical narratives which are appropriate for the movie media and applied various film languages that correspond with the contexts. In this aspect of < Chunhyang >, the movie is highly likely to be the model case of the modernization of classics. However, < Chunhyang > had its limits in terms of communication with the present. < ChunHyang > is the outcome of the director Gwontaek Im``s enthusiasm to reproduce the ``savor of sound`` of pansori and to deliver it to the audience today, even to the audience overseas. It coincides with the just which asserts globalization of most Korean heritage. However, it was director Im``s overenthusiasm. < ChunHyang >, despite its accomplishment, turns traditional art into the subject which needs to be learned and taught. With the interference of function of the textbook and its didactic attitude, audiences today are restricted not to actively enjoy traditional art. The interests observed in the academic field towards the classical narratives are related to the crisis emerged in the field of classic literature. Classical narratives are seen as the subject to learn, not as the art to relish to the audience nowadays. < ChunHyang >, which put textbook duty to itself with the intention of communicating with the audience, became the model of creative reinvention of 『Chunhyangjeon』``s living, breathing cinematic self-consciousness, but also, turned into the subject for learning. Reinvention to overcome the crisis regressed itself to the very cause that called for the predicament."
Apolipoprotein A1 Inhibits TGF-β1-Induced Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition of Alveolar Epithelial Cells,2016,"['Apolipoprotein A-1', 'Transforming Growth Factor Beta1', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis']",,"Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal lung disease characterized by the accumulation of excessive fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the extracellular matrix. The transforming growth factor ${\beta}1$ (TGF-${\beta}1$)-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to be a possible source of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts in IPF lungs. We have previously reported that apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) has anti-fibrotic activity in experimental lung fibrosis. In this study, we determine whether ApoA1 modulates TGF-${\beta}1$-induced EMT in experimental lung fibrosis and clarify its mechanism of action. Methods: The A549 alveolar epithelial cell line was treated with TGF-${\beta}1$ with or without ApoA1. Morphological changes and expression of EMT-related markers, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and ${\alpha}$-smooth muscle actin were evaluated. Expressions of Smad and non-Smad mediators and TGF-${\beta}1$ receptor type 1 ($T{\beta}RI$) and type 2 ($T{\beta}RII$) were measured. The silica-induced lung fibrosis model was established using ApoA1 overexpressing transgenic mice. Results: TGF-${\beta}1$-treated A549 cells were changed to the mesenchymal morphology with less E-cadherin and more N-cadherin expression. The addition of ApoA1 inhibited the TGF-${\beta}1$-induced change of the EMT phenotype. ApoA1 inhibited the TGF-${\beta}1$-induced increase in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and 3 as well as that of ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mediators. In addition, ApoA1 reduced the TGF-${\beta}1$-induced increase in $T{\beta}RI$ and $T{\beta}RII$ expression. In a mouse model of silica-induced lung fibrosis, ApoA1 overexpression reduced the silica-mediated effects, which were increased N-cadherin and decreased E-cadherin expression in the alveolar epithelium. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that ApoA1 inhibits TGF-${\beta}1$-induced EMT in experimental lung fibrosis."
Cloning of a novel endogenous promoter for foreign gene expression in Phaeodactylum tricornutum,2016,"['Constitutive expression', 'Glutamine synthetase promoter', 'Phaeodactylum tricornutum', 'Transformation']",,"Phaeodactylum tricornutum is a model diatom, and its genomic sequence data and expressed sequence tag databases are available. This study was to discover a new endogenous promoter that drives strong constitutive expression of a protein of interest in P. tricornutum. To find promoter candidates, the intracellular proteins of P. tricornutum grown to stationary phase were extracted and identified by LC–MS/MS. Glutamine synthetase (GLNA) was one of the most abundantly expressed proteins during the stationary phase. Promoter is usually located on 5′ upstream region of open reading frame of the gene. Thus, two fragments of 5′ upstream region of the GLNA gene as putative promoters, 501 and 997 bp long, were amplified and cloned into enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) reporter systems. The constructed reporter systems were transformed into P. tricornutum and the eGFP expression levels were compared to those of reporter systems using the promoters of fcpA (fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c binding protein A) and CIP1 (putative replication-associated proteins of a Chaetoceros lorenzianus-infecting DNA virus) as controls. The expression of eGFP driven by either GLNA promoter (501 and 997 bp) was linearly related to cell density, and eGFP was expressed constitutively regardless of the cultivation phase. The eGFP expression level driven by the GLNA promoters was at least 4 times higher than the fcpA-driven eGFP expression level at the stationary phase. The 501 and 997 bp regions of the GLNA promoter had similar activity patterns for transcribing the downstream gene. These results indicate that at least 501-bp region of the GLNA promoter can be used as a strong constitutive promoter in genetic engineering of P. tricornutum."

In case of need, BASF brought up its necessary scientific-technological research performance from the outside researchers and institutes, and then it has made its own and completed its task.In comparison of formerly cost and effort of R&D and production in chemical industry, its related charge on the synthetic indigo was enormous. For the sake of its necessary capital, BASF has increased its share capital, and then to retrieve investment costs and to restrict competition formed the dye cartel among german dye companies.From those days of the development and production of indigo, a cutthroat competition among german dye companies has been intensified and its dyes have been excessively produced, german dye companies entered into a pharmaceutical industry and BASF selected the nitrogen fixation process for new profit sources.As BASF has completed the Haber-Bosch Process, BASF has set a good precedent in which modern company sought to its profit sources of the future and its related research originated in laboratory of physical chemistry or inorganic chemistry in university. It may be fairly said that Haber-Bosch process was a model of an industrial-educational cooperation.Above all the processes, the Haber-Bosch Process was the capital-intensive process. For the reason, BASF and Carl Bosch would build up the large scale facilities, and then acquired its intended consequences. Its large scale facilities in which operated a large amount of gas under the high temperature and the high pressure, demanded to the chemical engineers on the new solutions and contributed to the manufacture of improved steels, valves of the new design and enhanced pressure devices.BASF and Bosch's endeavors come into the line with the establishment of the chemical engineering that originated in USA and then re-imported into Europe. Hereafter the union of the chemistry and engineering became the character of the modern industry."

The summit diplomacy among and between the heads of the states has extended its role of function in resolving major issues in international relations. Since South Kore is located among the major powers, peace and prosperity of South Korea relies on the external changes. Therefore, the research introduces a theory on the summit diplomacy and apply the model on the Korean cases.  There are 7 factors that facilitate the summit diplomacy: (1) the appearance of unprecedented threat and crisis diplomacy, (2) diplomacy policy as a new political tool, (3) the importance of business diplomacy, (4) extension of international community and regionalism, (5) the conflict between career diplomats and politicians, (6) power concentration to the head of government, and (7) development of technology. Except the general factors such as the last four variable, this research will apply the variables to Korean governments’ summit diplomacy on the major powers such as the U.S., China, Japan, and Russia.  With the analyses, this research presents a few findings. (1) The economic crisis such as the IMF crisis can override the security issue. However, as soon as the economic crisis is resolved, the security issue such as nuclear threat will soon appear and take over the policy initiative. (2) Regardless of the achievement, the inter-Korean summit meeting is likely to be regarded as a policy tool to divert the public criticism on domestic policy failure. (3) Although the summit diplomacy of South Korea can utilize the multilateral and bilateral format as well, the summity meeting appear to be a ceremonial protocol rather than a negotiation to resolve a critical issue. (4) The extension of summit diplomacy is a reflection of the improved national power of South Korea. (5) Despite the increased role of South Korean summit meeting, there remain difficulties to cope with the relative power gap with the major powers in order to achieve the national reunification."

Hence it is needed for venture firms to have more absorptive capacity in order to cope with the environmental change.

They generate projects by creating a vision, using strategies and objectives with funds aligning strategies and make efforts to complete them successfully because project success leads to business success. All projects have triple constraints such as scope, time, and cost to be completed. Project cost performance is a key factor to achieve project goals and which is mostly related with risks among various cost drivers. Projects require a cost estimation method to complete them within their budget and on time. An accurate budget cannot be estimated due to the uncertainties and risks. Thus some additional money should be funded in addition to the base budget as a contingency reserve for identified risks and a management reserve for unidentified risks. While research on contingency reserve for identified risks included in project budget baseline have been presented, research on management reserve for unidentified risks included in total project budget is still scarce. The lack of research on estimation method and role of the management reserve have made project managers little confidence to estimate project budget accurately with reasonable basis. This study proposes a practical model to estimate budgets including contingency and management reserves for not only project cost management but also to keep the balance of organization’s total funds to maximize return on investments for project portfolio management. The advantages of the proposed model are demonstrated by its application to construction projects in Korea and the processes to apply this model for verification are also provided."

The silica-induced lung fibrosis model was established using ApoA1 overexpressing transgenic mice.Results: TGF-β1–treated A549 cells were changed to the mesenchymal morphology with less E-cadherin and more N-cadherin expression. The addition of ApoA1 inhibited the TGF-β1–induced change of the EMT phenotype. ApoA1 inhibited the TGF-β1–induced increase in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and 3 as well as that of ERK and p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase mediators. In addition, ApoA1 reduced the TGF-β1–induced increase in TβRI and TβRII expression. In a mouse model of silica-induced lung fibrosis, ApoA1 overexpression reduced the silica-mediated effects, which were increased N-cadherin and decreased E-cadherin expression in the alveolar epithelium.Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that ApoA1 inhibits TGF-β1–induced EMT in experimental lung fibrosis."

(1) IMF와 같은 경제위기의 경우에도 국가의 안위와 관련된 경우에는 안보위기에 우선하여 위기외교의 긴급의제로 다루어지지만 경제위기가 일정정도 해소되면 북한핵과 같은 안보문제로 관심이 전환된다. (2) 북한과의 정상외교는 그 성과와 무관하게 정치적 수단으로서 성격이 강하기 때문에 정치적인 오해를 불러일으킬 수 있다.

(4) 한국의 정상외교의 비중이 확대되는 것은 국력의 확대에 따른 결과라고 볼 수 있다. 끝으로 (5) 한국의 정상외교가 직면하고 있는 한계는 한국의 안보와 번영에 필수적이라고 할 수 있는 동아시아 주변 4강과의 정상외교에서 상대적 국력의 한계를 극복하고 통일을 추구하는 궁극적 목표에는 여전히 어려움이 있다.","There is a major transformation in the form of diplomatic relations. The summit diplomacy among and between the heads of the states has extended its role of function in resolving major issues in international relations. Since South Kore is located among the major powers, peace and prosperity of South Korea relies on the external changes. Therefore, the research introduces a theory on the summit diplomacy and apply the model on the Korean cases.There are 7 factors that facilitate the summit diplomacy: (1) the appearance of unprecedented threat and crisis diplomacy, (2) diplomacy policy as a new political tool, (3) the importance of business diplomacy, (4) extension of international community and regionalism, (5) the conflict between career diplomats and politicians, (6) power concentration to the head of government, and (7) development of technology. Except the general factors such as the last four variable, this research will apply the variables to Korean governments’ summit diplomacy on the major powers such as the U.S., China, Japan, and Russia.With the analyses, this research presents a few findings. (1) The economic crisis such as the IMF crisis can override the security issue. However, as soon as the economic crisis is resolved, the security issue such as nuclear threat will soon appear and take over the policy initiative.  (2) Regardless of the achievement, the inter-Korean summit meeting is likely to be regarded as a policy tool to divert the public criticism on domestic policy failure. (3) Although the summit diplomacy of South Korea can utilize the multilateral and bilateral format as well, the summity meeting appear to be a ceremonial protocol rather than a negotiation to resolve a critical issue. (4) The extension of summit diplomacy is a reflection of the improved national power of South Korea. (5) Despite the increased role of South Korean summit meeting, there remain difficulties to cope with the relative power gap with the major powers in order to achieve the national reunification."

This research experimentally presents that the mass and damping of passive devices are the key factors in structural vibration suppressing. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), frequency modes and the total mass of devices are used to calculate the Power Spectral Density (PSD) values. As a benchmark, a rigid mass has been attached in the same way on the top floor of the structural model and then the experimental tests are conducted. Results of the comparison between responses of coupled Mass-Structure systems and the control structural systems identify the effects of the mass and damping on the mitigation of structural vibration for each control strategy."

For safe and reliable operation of an electrical drive system, faults in power electronic switches must be detected by an efficient system that is capable of identifying the type of faults. In this paper, an open switch fault identification technique for a three-phase inverter is presented. Single, double, and triple switching faults can be diagnosed using this method. The detection mechanism is based on stator current analysis. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) using Daubechies is performed on the Clarke transformed (-) stator current and features are extracted from the wavelets. An artificial neural network is then used for the detection and identification of faults. To prove the feasibility of this method, a Simulink model of the DWT-based feature extraction scheme using a neural network for the proposed fault detection system in a three-phase inverter with an induction motor is briefly discussed with simulation results. The simulation results show that the designed system can detect faults quite efficiently, with the ability to differentiate between single and multiple switching faults."
Suggesting a new testing device for determination of tensile strength of concrete,2016,"['compression to tensile load convertor', 'tensile strength of concrete']",,"A compression to tensile load transforming (CTT) device was developed to determine indirect tensile strength of concrete material. Before CTT test, Particle flow code was used for the determination of the standard dimension of physical samples. Four numerical models with different dimensions were made and were subjected to tensile loading. The geometry of the model with ideal failure pattern was selected for physical sample preparation. A concrete slab with dimensions of 15×19×6 cm and a hole at its center was prepared and subjected to tensile loading using this special loading device. The ratio of hole diameter to sample width was 0.5. The samples were made from a mixture of water, fine sand and cement with a ratio of 1-0.5-1, respectively. A 30-ton hydraulic jack with a load cell applied compressive loading to CTT with the compressive pressure rate of 0.02 MPa per second. The compressive loading was converted to tensile stress on the sample because of the overall test design. A numerical modeling was also done to analyze the effect of the hole diameter on stress concentrations of the hole side along its horizontal axis to provide a suitable criterion for determining the real tensile strength of concrete. Concurrent with indirect tensile test, the Brazilian test was performed to compare the results from two methods and also to perform numerical calibration. The numerical modeling shows that the models have tensile failure in the sides of the hole along the horizontal axis before any failure under shear loading. Also the stress concentration at the edge of the hole was 1.4 times more than the applied stress registered by the machine. Experimental Results showed that, the indirect tensile strength was clearly lower than the Brazilian test strength."

The Essential Prerequisites of Agile Transition and Adoption: a Grounded Theory Approach,2016,"['Agile Software Development', 'Agile Methods', 'Agile Transformation', 'Agile Adoption', 'Transition Prerequisites', 'Agile Transition', 'Grounded Theory (GT)']",,"Prevalence of Agile methods in software companies is increasing dramatically. Software companies need to employ these methods to overcome the inherent challenges of traditional methods. However, transitioning to Agile approach is a topic of debate and there is no unique and well-defined transition model or framework yet. Although some research studies have addressed barriers and strengths behind the successful Agile deployment, it seems that this process still needs to be studied more in depth. The rationale behind this is the socio-technical nature of Agile transition and adoption. Particularly, the challenges and problems that software companies are facing during Agile transition, show that this process in more difficult than expected. Conducting a large-scale research study revealed that Agile transition and adoption process needs to be supported by several critical prerequisites. This study adopted a Ground Theory with the participation of 49 Agile experts from 13 different countries and empirically identified seven transition prerequisites. These prerequisites focus on the different aspects of the transition. The main aim of this paper is proposing these prerequisites and theoretical and practical implication of these prerequisites. Providing these prerequisites before moving to Agile increases chance of success in Agile transition and adoption and leads to fewer challenges during the change process."

The PVDF/PEO blends were prepared from solution in the whole composition range. Isothermal and non-isothermal experiments were carried out using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Since the components of the blend crystallize separately due to high difference of the melting points, the changes in melting, crystallization, and equilibrium melting temperatures of PVDF and PEO as well as the degree of crystallization were evaluated. As the binary blends display an asymmetric lower critical solution temperature (LCST)-type phase diagram, the crystallization behavior and kinetics were strongly affected by the miscibility state of the blends in the melt. Particularly, the overall crystallization of PEO was accelerated in the blends with high level of PEO (>50 wt%) by two different mechanisms. The formation of phase separated domains at this composition range enhanced the nucleation ability due to the “spinodal decomposition/ interface assisted crystallization”. Moreover, presence of preexisting crystals of PVDF could act as a substrate for PEO crystallization and increased the crystallization growth rate. Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were also utilized to study the crystalline polymorphism of PVDF and PEO in the blends."

The derived governing differential equations are solved by DTM which demonstrated to have high precision and computational efficiency in the vibration analysis of nanobeams. The detailed mathematical derivations are presented and numerical investigations are performed while the emphasis is placed on investigating the effect of thermal loading, small scale and surface effects, mode number, thickness ratio and boundary conditions on the normalized natural frequencies and critical buckling loads of the nanobeams in detail. The results show that the surface effects lead to an increase in natural frequency and critical buckling load of nanotubes. It is explicitly shown that the vibration and buckling of a nanotube is significantly influenced by these effects and the influence of thermal loadings and nonlocal effects are minimal."

To achieve this, a different navigation coordinate was introduced that avoids the gimbal lock in pitch singularity point. Attitude and guidance control algorithms were developed for the flight control system. For flight test purposes, a quadrotor attached with a tailless fixed-wing structure was manufactured. An onboard flight control computer was designed to realize the navigation and control algorithms and the UAV’s performance was verified through the outdoor flight tests."

프로이트의 메타심리학적 시도와 정신기관,2016,"['메타심리학', '정신기관', '무의식', '소원', '억압', 'Metapsychologie', 'der psychische Apparat', 'das Unbewusste', 'Wunsch', 'Verdrangung']",,"""Die Wiener Moderne"" ist von der weitreichenden Transformation des naturwissenschaftlichen Wissens gepragt. Nicht nur wurde in Kaffeehausern von der neuesten Entdeckung der Naturwissenschaft gesprochen, Kunstler wie Gustav Klimt sowie die Schriftsteller wurden von ihr inspiriert und sie haben das naturwissenschaftliche Wissen in das Kunstschaffen umgesetzt. Die heutzutage viel proklamierte ``Consilience`` des Wissens scheint in Wien um 1900 bereits erprobt worden zu sein. Freud, der in Wien seine wissenschaftliche Bahn annahm, war als Sohn seiner Zeit der Meinung, zwischen Psychologie und Neurobiologie vermitteln zu konnen. Vor dem Hintergrund der Wissenstransformation in der Wiener Moderne befasst sich die vorliegende Arbeit mit dem fruhen metapsychologischen Konzept von Sigmund Freud, das bis zu den Schriften Entwurf einer Psychologie(1895) und Traumdeutung(1900) zuruckverfolgt wird. Sie stellt die These auf, dass Freuds Metapsychologie die unbewussten Vorgange des Psychischen, die er in dem Modell des psychischen Apparates komprimiert hat, als eine Art von Neuronenmaschine auffasst, die in seiner Struktur und Funktion ebenso eine Wunschmaschine ist. Dabei zeigt sie anhand der Konzepte ""Befriedigungserlebnis"" und ""Wunscherfullung"" die doppelten Bezuge der Metapsychologie auf Biologie und Soziologie. Auch der Vorgang der ""Verdrangung"" lasst sich energetisch erklaren, wodurch die Gegensatzlichkeit vom primaren und sekundaren Vorgang des Unbewussten zutage tritt. Schließlich versteht sich die vorliegende Arbeit als der erste Versuch eines weiteren Forschungsvorhabens, die literarischen Auseinandersetzungen mit der seinerzeit in Mode gewesenen Naturwissenschaft Biologie zu ergrunden."
Integrated Method for Text Detection in Natural Scene Images,2016,"['Stroke Color Extension', 'character classifier', 'Character Color Transform', 'Convolutional Neural Network']",,"In this paper, we present a novel image operator to extract textual information in natural scene images. First, a powerful refiner called the Stroke Color Extension, which extends the widely used Stroke Width Transform by incorporating color information of strokes, is proposed to achieve significantly enhanced performance on intra-character connection and non-character removal. Second, a character classifier is trained by using gradient features. The classifier not only eliminates non-character components but also remains a large number of characters. Third, an effective extractor called the Character Color Transform combines color information of characters and geometry features. It is used to extract potential characters which are not correctly extracted in previous steps. Fourth, a Convolutional Neural Network model is used to verify text candidates, improving the performance of text detection.

Discrete wavelet transform and principal component analysis are utilized to detect the discontinuity in currents caused by a fault. The features of fault diagnosis are then extracted. A fault dictionary is used to acquire details about transistor faults and the corresponding fault identification. Fault classification is performed with a fuzzy logic system and relevance vector machine (RVM). The proposed model is incorporated with a set of optimization techniques, namely, evolutionary particle swarm optimization (EPSO) and cuckoo search optimization (CSO), to improve fault detection. The combination of optimization techniques with classification techniques is analyzed. Experimental results confirm that the combination of CSO with RVM yields better results than the combinations of CSO with fuzzy logic system, EPSO with RVM, and EPSO with fuzzy logic system."
Fault Detection and Diagnosis System for a Three-Phase Inverter Using a DWT-Based Artificial Neural Network,2016,"['Stator current analysis', 'Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)', 'Feature extraction', 'Fault detection and identification', 'Inverter switching faults', 'Variable speed AC drive', 'Induction motor', 'Artificial neural network system', 'Clarke transformation']",,"Inverters are considered the basic building blocks of industrial electrical drive systems that are widely used for various applications; however, the failure of electronic switches mainly affects the constancy of these inverters. For safe and reliable operation of an electrical drive system, faults in power electronic switches must be detected by an efficient system that is capable of identifying the type of faults. In this paper, an open switch fault identification technique for a three-phase inverter is presented. Single, double, and triple switching faults can be diagnosed using this method. The detection mechanism is based on stator current analysis. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) using Daubechies is performed on the Clarke transformed (-) stator current and features are extracted from the wavelets. An artificial neural network is then used for the detection and identification of faults. To prove the feasibility of this method, a Simulink model of the DWT-based feature extraction scheme using a neural network for the proposed fault detection system in a three-phase inverter with an induction motor is briefly discussed with simulation results. The simulation results show that the designed system can detect faults quite efficiently, with the ability to differentiate between single and multiple switching faults."

Post catch-up with market cultivation and product servicising: case of Taiwan’s transportation equipment industries,2016,"['post catch-up', 'technological catch-up', 'product servicising', 'market cultivation', 'business model']",,"This paper sets out to examine a key issue: how a latecomer like Taiwan may develop itsindustry in a post catch-up manner. We make intensive inquiries into this issue via casestudies on two sectors in Taiwan, namely the bicycle industry and the electric vehicle (EV)industry. Our conceptual framework gives special account to fuzzy front-end at theindustrial level and how market cultivation and innovative business models come to play animportant role in shaping the innovation path for post catch-up. For leading players inTaiwan’s bicycle industry, a key issue they faced was how to transform themselves andlocal setting in Taiwan to become a leader in high-end bicycles to fend off escalatedinternational competition. In the emerging EV industry, the Taiwanese players try toovercome its structural weaknesses in the mainstream automotive industry to explore thepossibility of levelling the playing field with the forerunners in the advanced countries. Ourcase studies suggest that technological catch-up is not necessarily a prelude to post catch-up,depending on the nature of new innovation trajectory and entry modes of the emergingindustry. Our analyses also lend support to the importance of product servicising as a meansof post catch-up, especially from the perspective of market cultivation."

This is because the 1st and 2nd torsional vibration modes are closely spaced in frequency domain leading to the situation that the modal decomposition is difficult to achieve by simple band-pass filter. Present study applied several different modal decomposition methods to derive the damping ratio of different modes. The modal decomposition methods considered in this study are simple band-pass filter, Hilbert vibration decomposition, Wavelet transform and proper orthogonal decomposition. Coupled free decay signal obtained from the torsional hammering test on a segmented hull model was processed with four different methods and the derived damping ratios were compared with each other. Discussions also have been made on the pros and cons of the different methodologies."

If they often transform existing works into animations, we may have to examine how they change the original to communicate with the audience and also how they change the original’s subject matter or theme to create meaning. The purpose of this study is to consider how the original’s meaning and value were changed as Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale, 「The Snow Queen」, was converted into an animation, 〈Frozen〉, and also how it influenced the work itself. To attain the goal, this author is going to comparatively analyze the two works’ narratives, actants, and semiotic squares by using A.J. Greimas’ semiology. According to the findings, although 「The Snow Queen」 expresses the desire to go back to happy days in the past, it is not a simple return to the past but a stepwise process to become mature mentally as well as religiously. Meanwhile, 〈Frozen〉 intends to generate past-oriented meaning expressing the desire to return what is abnormal in the present to what was normal in the past and resolve the individual and religious aspects of 「The Snow Queen」 in a social and popular way."
통일 과정에서 농업협동조합 고찰,2016,"['협동조합', '독일통일', '북한경제', 'Cooperative', 'die deutsche Vereinigung', 'nordkoreanische Wirtschaft']","한반도가 어떤 형태로 통일을 이룰지 우리 모두 아직 알 수 없다. 첫 번째 시나리오는 연방 형태의 통일을 골자로 하는 6·15 남북 공동선언 (2000년)을 기반으로 한다. 이보다 앞서 1980년 10월 김일성 전 주석은 남북한 체제가 공존해야 한다는 제안을 하였다. 남북 공동선언은 북한에 여전히 유효하며 북한은 독일 통일 모델을 한국에 적용할 것을 최근에도 재차 거부했다. 이러한 이유로 강연 첫 파트에선 통일 과정에서 북한 경제 체제와 농업협동조합이 유지한다는 전제 하에 동 주제를 다루겠다. 두 번째 시나리오는 독일 통일과정에서 구동독 농업생산조합의 구서독 협동조합법에 따른 조정과정을 고찰하겠다. 통일 후 무엇보다 두 가지 측면에서 개선이 필요했다. 하나는 농업생산조합을 단순히 등록 협동조합으로 전환하는 것은 조합을 효율성이 높은 기업으로 구조조정하기엔 충분하지 않았다는 점이다. 따라서 협동조합을 합자회사 및 자본회사로 전환하는 것이 추가적으로 허용되었다. 두 번째로 농업생산조합 후속기업에 남은 조합원과 보상금을 받고 조합을 탈퇴한 회원 간 이해관계 충돌로 탈퇴 회원이 적은 액수의 보상금만을 받는 일이 발생했다. 이로 인해 탈퇴 회원에 대한 보상금 규정이 점점 구체화되었다. 이와 같은 모든 조치에도 불구하고 농업생산조합을 독일 연방공화국 법으로 통합하는 과정에서 많은 문제가 발생했으며 동 조치도 이를 막지 못했다. 특히 조합 전환과 재산 문제를 다룰 때 재차 문제점이 나타났다. 따라서 한국이 독일을 선례로 통일을 할 경우, 1989년과 1990년 당시 독일 입법자들보다 농업협동조합 법에 대한 대비를 더 철저히 해야 한다.","Die heutige Tagung ist Rechtsfragen einer Wiedervereinigung auf der koreanischen Halbinsel gewidmet. In welcher Form diese Wiedervereinigung vollzogen werden wird, wissen wir heute noch nicht. Deshalb möchte ich im folgenden mein Thema auf der Grundlage zweier unterschiedlicher Szenarien behandeln. Das erste Szenario fußt auf der June 15th North-South Joint Declaration (2000), die von einer Wiedervereinigung in der Form einer Konföderation – so die Vorstellung des Südens – bzw. von einer losen Föderation – so der Vorschlag des Nordens – spricht, wobei nach dem Vorschlag Kim Il Sungs vom Oktober 1980 die Gesellschaftssysteme beider Teile Koreas koexistieren sollten. Diese Declaration ist aus nordkoreanischer Sicht immer noch aktuell. Der nordkoreanische Außenminister Ri Su Yong hat auf der UNO-Vollversammlung am 27.9.2014 eine Konföderation mit zwei Systemen in einem Land angeregt. In seiner Neujahrsansprache 2016 hat Marschall (Wonsu) Kim Jong Un einer Veränderung des Systems in Nordkorea und einer einseitigen Systemvereinigung eine Absage erteilt. Erst kürzlich wieder hat Nordkorea das Modell der Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands für Korea abgelehnt. Darum empfehlen auch in Südkorea manche Wissenschaftler, das politische Vorgehen zunächst auf der Basis einer low-level confederation der beiden Koreas statt auf der Grundlage einer vielleicht erst später möglichen vollständigen Wiedervereinigung zu planen. Deshalb gehe ich im ersten Teil meines Vortrags von einem Fortbestand des nordkoreanischen Wirtschaftssystems und seiner landwirtschaftlichen Genossenschaften in einem Wiedervereinigungsprozess aus. Dieser erste Teil meiner Präsentation fußt auf einem Vortrag, den ich im September 2014 an der Kim Il Sung-Universität in Pyongyang gehalten habe und der in einem Publikationsorgan der Kim Il Sung-Universität veröffentlicht werden wird. Als zweites Szenario soll die Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands dienen, bei welcher die ostdeutschen Landwirtschaftlichen Produktionsgenossenschaften in das westdeutsche Genossenschafts- bzw.

The cD3 coefficients through wavelet transform in the feature extraction was best matched with the characteristics of partial discharges. The final results of the developed diagnosis algorithm showed the very high accuracy on each partial discharge faults."

A level monitoring system mainly consists of a sensing line and pressure transmitter. Over a period of time boron sediments or other impurities can clog the line which may degrade the accuracy of the monitoring system. The aim of this study is to determine blockage in a sensing line using the energy of the composite signal. An equivalent Pi circuit model is used to simulate blockages in the sensing line and the system's response is examined under different blockage levels. Composite signals obtained from the model and plant's unblocked and blocked channels are decomposed into six levels of details and approximations using a wavelet filter bank. The percentage of energy is calculated at each level for approximations. It is observed that the percentage of energy reduces as the blockage level in the sensing line increases. The results of the model and operational data are well correlated. Thus, in our opinion variation in the energy levels of approximations can be used as an index to determine the presence and degree of blockage in a sensing line."
Crystallization kinetics for carbon dioxide gas hydrate in fixed bed and stirred tank reactor,2016,"['Gas Hydrates', 'Avrami Equation', 'Kinetics', 'Fixed Bed', 'CO2 Capture & Sequestration']",,The phase change from germ nuclei to growth nuclei and subsequent volume transformation in a crystallization process was modeled by Avrami equations. The phase change during the hydrate formation was fitted with the classical Avrami model by utilizing gas uptake data. The idea is to understand the difference in growth behavior of hydrate crystals when in small pores compared to a stirred tank reactor which does not pose any physical restrictions to hydrate growth. The parameters n and k of the Avrami equation were determined explicitly for CO2 hydrate formation.

Typical Transaction Cost Analysis theory explains that when transaction cost with business channels(whether it is for buy or sell) increase, the firms integrate the channels. So it is a choice made by firms regarding direct versus indirect channels. The theory was extended to a model of choice of institutional form of direct or indirect export by a norm of opportunism in this empirical study. The survey result showed that lower level of asset specificity and marketing capability or higher level of environmental uncertainty were likely to expose indirect exporters to higher level of opportunism of direct exporter. And we also saw that indirect exporters were likely to choose direct export chanel when opportunism of exporters was higher. From the standpoint of theory, we can say that the basic propositions of the Transaction Cost Analysis, except the attribute of frequency, are supported. This study result could provide a profiling of target business areas and firms for government’s policy on direct export promotion of SMEs."

The labor reform, the U.S. military government implemented in Korea and Japan, aimed to establish economic unionism, which modeled the U.S.`s Wagner Act. However, due to the advent of the Cold War, the achievement of labor reform failed. As a result, several labor bodies lost political power in post-war South Korea and Japan. The reports on the labor policies of the U.S. military government illustrates several areas in the original plan which caused their loss of influence. While suspect of communists ensconced within labor union, the drafters of labor reports did not dispense with their original plan of establishing a democratic labor union. However, the labor reform policies were delayed due to confrontation with the Soviet Union, ultimately leading to the purging of communists. This Cold War transformation was more radical in Korea than in Japan. First, lack of information and institutions or agents for governing caused the transformation in the case of Korea. In Korea, all powers were concentrated in the hands of the commander, John R. Hodge. Second, the style and governing methods by way of alternative political forces worsened the degree of conflict in Korea as opposed to conflict in Japan. This studies ends with exploring spatial differences connected to colonial influences, and suggests that the post-war Cold War society originated during the pre-war order."

This article will pay especially close attention to the activation of welfare politics through constitutionalism that can be achieved by not reproducing the status quo in self-completed systems, but various social practices about constitutional interpretation based on popular participation, parliamentarism and party competition.  In my view, the definition of the social state is that the state system provides the proper standard of living, resolves inequality by discrimination, and improves substantial freedom and democracy to obtain social equity for members in the community. According to this concept, I identified the importance of constitutional interpretation and practice by reviewing the debate on the social state in Germany. And in the case of Nordic welfare states, it could have been improved welfare rights through legislation by the parliament and political parties on the consensual democracy.  The state system is a constitutional concept as well as a form of government in the meaning of including electoral system and the relationship between the state and society. In this sense, constitutional reform should result in public issues, interaction of constitutional interpretation, and constitutional practice beyond the gap between the norm and practice.  In conclusion, to pursue socialization for the deepening of constitutional basic rights, it is necessary that reforms to the consensus democracy consolidate a sustainable democratic social state as an active protector that transforms the welfare state democratically in process of the coordinating government, parliament, and civil society to overcome the functional understanding of the welfare state under the current constitution."

Owing to the uncertainties entangled with the scale law transforming the measured impact pressure up to the full scale one, so called comparative approach was taken to derive the design sloshing load. The target design vessel was chosen as 230 K LNG-FPSO with tow-row tank arrangement and the reference vessel as 138 K conventional LNG carrier, which has past track record without any significant failure due to sloshing loads. Starting with the site-specific metocean data, ship motion analysis was carried out with 3D diffraction-radiation program, then the obtained ship motion data was used as 6DOF tank excitation for subsequent sloshing model test and analysis. The statistical analysis was carried out with obtained peak data and the long-term sloshing load was determined out of it. It was concluded that the normalized sloshing impact pressure on 230 K LNG-FPSO with two-row tank arrangement is higher than that of convectional LNG carrier, hence requires the use of reinforced cargo containment system for the sake of failure-free operation without filling limitation."

Also we applied transformed TAM(Technology Acceptance Model) to search factors that have an effect on consumers’ intention to use it. In advance, we analyze features of bit coin, and extract factors through preceding researches for existing electronic cash, because studies for intention to use bit coin are weak in internal and external.  First of results is that ‘economic efficiency’ which is a characteristic variable of bit coin influences ‘intention to use,’ a dependent variable through ‘perceived usefulness,’ a parameter. It was investigated that monetary and mental costs that was costed when we use bit coin were less than using other cash. Secondly, ‘payment convenience’ that is a characteristic variable affects ‘intention to use’, a dependent variable through ‘perceived usefulness,’ a parameter. It was measured that problems of inconvenience that include transaction process, cash management time shortage and exchange changes will be solved by using bit coin. Thirdly, ‘reliability’ that is a perceived risk variable of bit coin has a direct effect on ‘intention to use,’ a dependent variable. It was investigated that we could achieve purpose of payment because we weren’t influenced by breakdown on system by processing distributed database in some computers. Fourthly, ‘perceived usefulness,’ a parameter of bit coin directly affects ‘intention to use,’ a dependent variable. Then consumers who want to use bit coin are fascinated bit coin for various usability.

This study analyzed the effect of transducer type on ultrasound computed tomography (UCT) image quality. The UCT was modeled in an ultrasound simulator by using a 5 cm anatomy model and a ring-shape 5 MHz 128 transducer array, which considered attenuation, refraction, and reflection. Speed-of-sound images were reconstructed by the Radon transform as the UCT image modality. Acoustic impedance images were also reconstructed by the delayand-sum (DAS) method, which considered the speed of sound information. To determine the optimal combination of transducers in observation, point-source, flat, and focused transducers were tested in combination as trasmitters and receivers; UCT images were constructed from each combination.

We also demonstrate how this fast economic growth has molded the country`s socio-politico-cultural life and, in doing so at an semi-anthropological and pseudo-ethnographical approach, help readers to better understand the contemporary life style of average South Koreans. The experience of economic growth in South Korea is unprecedented in human history and provides a role model for the design of strategies for economic growth and development, as well as for associated government policies, for recently developing economies. We then show that the economy and society in South Korea provides an example of a living laboratory to understand better both developing and advanced economies. The “growing pain” of fast-growing economies and the “geriatric symptom” of advanced economies coexist in contemporary South Korea."

We performedlaboratory model tests to investigate the presence of cavities using impact-echo method, which is a nondestructive testmethod. To simulate a concrete sewer pipe, a thin concrete plate was built and placed over container filled with sand.The cavity was modeled as an extruded polystyrene foam box. Two sets of tests were performed, one over sand andthe other on cavity. A new impact device was developed to apply a consistent high frequency impact load on the concreteplate, thereby increasing the reliability of the test procedure. The frequency and transient characteristics of the measuredreflected waveforms were analyzed via fast Fourier transform and short time Fourier spectrum. It was shown that theshapes of Fourier spectra are very similar to one another, and therefore cannot be used to predict the presence of cavity.A new index, termed resonance duration, is defined to record the time of vibration exceeding a prescribed intensity.The results showed that the resonance duration is a more effective parameter for predicting the presence of a cavity.A value of the resonance period was proposed to estimate the presence of cavity. Further studies using various soiltypes and field tests are warranted to validate the proposed approach."

Gradually exacerbating poverty and unemployment were problematized as risks to the continuation of the current capitalist regime. As a risk management, it pursued the strategy to integrate the disadvantaged into society by providing them jobs through promoting social enterprises. In this process, the knowledge system of social capital theory served as a guideline through which the social could be used as means for governmental ends. In the governing mechanism of social enterprises promotion, the state took the strategy to form a hierarchical partnership with civic organizations. It transformed the areas of the social into recognizable and governable ones through regular evaluation of each social enterprise’s performance. By monopolizing authority to call an organization ‘social enterprise,’ it led the activities of public good-oriented civic organizations to be conformed to the goal of government. Through coupling social enterprises with big commercial enterprises and promoting Pro Bono campaign, it facilitated knowledge, methods and logic of business administration to be infiltrated into the fabric of social enterprises. The mechanism of the social enterprise promotion in South Korea shows that neoliberal governmentality is not incompatible with the values of communal solidarity, democratic participation of citizens, and social-public orientation. Rather it operates through these values."

As a result, tan δ showed the characteristics of slight decrease at the first stage and then increase with the aging time, which could be analyzed due to the evaporation of remaining moisture and the change of aging rate with time. Also, the trend of tensile strengths with aging temperature and time was appeared to be exponentially decreased and by use of these data equivalent calculated lifetimes and accelerated aging factors were derived for each aging temperatures. After then, tan δ was analyzed with the equivalent operating years.

Pour cette etude, nous avons choisi comme textes d`analyse Le Petit Chaperon Rouge de Charles Perrault et des freres Grimm et quatre publicites qui les parodient. Notre analyse s`appuie sur la theorie semiotique a partir des travaux de Vladimir Propp jusqu`a Algirdas Julien Greimas.

De nos jours, le conte de fees est souvent transpose dans l`univers de la publicite, d`autant que le storytelling en publicite est plus important que l`image provocante ou l`expression directe du message publicitaire. Le conte de fees est tres utile a etre recree comme publicite du point de vue de son universalite, de sa structure narrative, de ses elements mysterieux et surnaturels, de ses caracteristiques metaphoriques et instructives et de sa liberte de violation du droit d`auteur, etc. Lors de la transformation du conte de fees en publicite, il est d`abord necessaire de choisir un conte auquel l`objectif publicitaire correspond, et ensuite de prendre en compte les facons diverses de la parodie du conte de fees selon les recepteurs publicitaires(audience, consommateur…). Ayant compare le degre de parodie du Petit Chaperon Rouge par les modeles semiotiques que nous avons degages dans quatre publicites, le conte de fees est plus deforme dans la publicite commerciale que dans la publicite visant l`interet public. Et les recepteurs publicitaires sont d`autant plus ages que le conte de fees est plus deforme pour echapper a l`histoire codifiee ; le chaperon rouge n`est plus une victime mais une maltresse douce qui soumet le loup. Le loupe est au contraire neutralise. Pour la parodie efficace, il est capital d`amener le public a voir differemment ce que lui est familier. En fait, l`hypertexte(la publicite) est oblige d`impliquer la difference dans la similitude avec l`hypotexte(le conte de fees) pour sortir du cliche. Les publicitaires doivent donc chercher a integrer la mode contemporaine dans la structure narrative du conte de fees pour s`attirer la sympathie du public et y fondre efficacement des elements pratiques, ludiques et metaphoriques qui sont importants pour le monde de la publicite."

Oxidation depth measurements confirmed that the oxide growth appeared to be faster in the case of nanoporous GaN than that of bulk GaN. Spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to evaluate and compare the optical properties of nanoporous and bulk Ga2O3 films, such as refractive index and extinction coefficient, which revealed improved optical properties for nanoporous Ga2O3 compared to the bulk. The simulations conducted on the ellipsometric spectra for bulk and nanoporous Ga2O3 using the Forouhi-Bloomer model and the Bruggeman effective medium approximation revealed the best fit with a low mean square error value. In the case of nanoporous Ga2O3, zero absorption was observed in the wavelength range of 300 nm to 840 nm, supporting the use of this material as a transparent coating in optoelectronic devices.</P>"

In order to accomplish it, the study examines the definition and key principles of critical pedagogy as a best teaching practice, and describes music teaching model developed by Frank Abrahams based on critical pedagogy. Then, this study provides sample music lessons based on Abrahams’ teaching model and suggests the implications of critical music lesson. Critical pedagogy for music education inspires a conversational exchange of information between a music teacher and students and it shifts the power structures in music classroom by acknowledging that students come to class with information gleaned from their own experiences. Also, critical music pedagogy poses and solves questions and problems to students that the pedagogy causes them to take what they already knew and understood from their world outside music classroom and connects it to their educational goals. This breaks down barriers that exist between what students understood outside the classroom and the knowledge their teacher wants them to learn. Throughout this process, students feel empowered by their knowledge and are alerted to plentiful opportunities for meaningful experiences inside and outside the classroom. This leads to change in perception and transforming experience for both students and their teacher."

The composite FRP pipe element is treated as a beam element. The finite pipe element is constructed in the wavelet space and then transformed to the physical space. Detailed expressions of the mass and stiffness matrices are derived for the composite pipe using the Bspline scaling and wavelet functions. Both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories are considered. The generalized eigenvalue problem is formulated and solved to obtain the modal characteristics of the composite pipe. The developed wavelet-based finite element discretization scheme utilizes significantly less elements compared to the conventional finite element method for modeling composite pipes. Numerical solutions are obtained to demonstrate the accuracy of the developed element, which is verified by comparisons with some available results in the literature."
Decoupling of the Secondary Saliencies in Sensorless PMSM Drives using Repetitive Control in the Angle Domain,2016,"['CwSPMSM', 'Repetitive control', 'Secondary saliencies', 'Sensorless control']",,"To decouple the secondary saliencies in sensorless permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives, a repetitive control (RC) in the angle domain is proposed. In this paper, the inductance model of a concentrated windings surface-mounted PMSM (cwSPMSM) with strong secondary saliencies is developed. Due to the secondary saliencies, the estimated position contains harmonic disturbances that are periodic relative to the angular position. Through a transformation from the time domain to the angle domain, these varying frequency disturbances can be treated as constant periodic disturbances. The proposed angle-domain RC is plugged into an existing phase-locked loop (PLL) and utilizes the error of the PLL to generate signals to suppress these periodic disturbances.

Molecular Orientation of Intercalants Stabilized in the Interlayer Space of Layered Ceramics: 1-D Electron Density Simulation,2016,"['Layered ceramics', 'Clays', 'Intercalation', '2-D nanohybrids', '1-D Electron density simulation']",,"In this review, an attempt is made to calculate one-dimensional (1-D) electron density profiles from experimentally determined (00l) XRD intensities and possible structural models as well in an effort to understand the collective intracrystalline structures of intercalant molecules of two-dimensional (2-D) nanohybrids with heterostructures. 2-D ceramics, including layered metal oxides and clays, have received much attention due to their potential applicability as catalysts, electrodes, stabilizing agents, and drug delivery systems. 2-D nanohybrids based on such layered ceramics with various heterostructures have been realized through intercalation reactions. In general, the physico-chemical properties of such 2-D nanohybrids are strongly correlated with their heterostructures, but it is not easy to solve the crystal structures due to their low crystallinity and high anisotropic nature. However, the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis method is thought to be the most powerful means of understanding the interlayer structures of intercalant molecules. If a proper number of well-developed (00l) XRD peaks are available for such 2-D nanohybrids, the 1-D electron density along the crystallographic c-axis can be calculated via a Fourier transform analysis to obtain structural information about the orientations and arrangements of guest species in the interlayer space."
UN 안보리 결의안 제2270호의 대북제재가 북한경제에 미치는 영향 분석,2016,"['안보리 결의안 제2270호', '대북제재', '북한수출', '북한수입', '생산함수모형', 'UN Security Council Resolution 2270', 'Sanction against North Korea', 'North Korea’s Export', 'North Korea’s Import', 'Production Function Model']","2016년 1월 및 2월에 일어난 북한의 4차 핵실험 및 장거리미사일 발사에 따라 UN 안보리는 기존 결의안보다 내용 및 강도 면에서 매우 강화된 대북결의안 제2270호를 지난 3월 통과시켰다. 결의안 제2270호의 대북제재조치로 인해 북한경제가 어느 정도 영향을 받게될 것인가에 대한 실증 분석은 향후 북한의 태도 변화 전망과 그에 따른 국제사회의 대응책 마련이라는 측면에서 중요하다. 자본재, 설비부품, 연료 및 원자재 등을 공급하는 북한수입은 노동 및 자본요소에 추가된 또 다른 생산요소로서 역할을 하고 있다는 점에서 본 연구에서는 수입부문이 추가된, 확장된 생산함수모형을 사용하여 북한 지하자원의 수출 금지로 인해 북한수입이 감소될 경우 그에 따른 북한의 생산, 즉 GDP가 어느 정도 영향을 받는지를 실증 분석하였다.1980~2014년 기간 동안을 대상으로 분석한 결과를 보면, 북한의 광물자원 수출이 금지될 경우 2014년 기준으로 약 1.5억 달러의 외화수입이 감소되고 그에 따른 북한수입의 감소는 북한 실질 GDP를 약 7.6% 감소시키는 것으로 나타났다. 한국의 개성공단 폐쇄는 연간 1억 2천말 달러의 외화수입을 차단함으로써 북한 실질 GDP의 약 0.6% 추가적 감소효과를 발생시키는 것으로 조사되었다. 이번 결의안 제2270호에는 포함되지 않았지만 북한의 무력도발이 지속될 경우 북한의 해외인력 송출 금지조치가 추가적 대북제제조치가 될 가능성이 높다. 현재 북한은 해외근로자 송출로부터 약 3~5억 달러의 자금을 확보하는 것으로 알려지고 있는데, 이러한 자금줄이 차단될 경우 북한 실질 GDP는 약 1.5~2.5% 추가 감소될 것으로 예상된다.안보리 결의안 제2270호의 대북제재가 북한경제에 미치는 실증 분석 결과는 단기적 충격효과만을 제시하고 있을 뿐이다. 석탄, 철광석 등 지하자원 수출 금지에 따른 외화수입의 감소는 북한수입의 위축으로 북한의 생산을 감소시키고 이는 다시 북한경제의 재생산능력을 약화시킴으로써 중장기적으로는 북한경제의 작동에 심각한 영향을 줄 것으로 분석된다. 대북제재에 따른 경제적 난국을 돌파하기 위해 북한은 내부자원을 최대한 동원하는 노력을 시도할 가능성이 높다. 내부자원의 효율적 동원을 위해서는 주민에게 경제적 인센티브가 제도적으로 제공되어야하며, 이를 위해서는 생산설비 등에 대한 사용권 또는 소유권의 제도적 보장, 즉 북한시장의 제도화가 선행되어야 한다. 안보리 결의안 제2270호의 대북제재는 북한의 핵·WMD·미사일 프로그램의 중단 및 포기 이외에도 북한시장의 제도화를 통해 북한경제체제 전환을 북한 내부에서 촉발시킬 수 있다는 점에서 또 다른 의미를 찾을 수 있다.","Responding to recent military provocations of North Korea, UN Security Council passes Resolution 2270 on March 2, 2016, which includes provisions more stronger than those of existing resolutions in terms of depth and width. The empirical analysis on the economic effect of Resolution 2270 is important, for it provides the meaningful reference to evaluate the change of North Korea’s stance in the near future and set up policy alternatives toward such a change. North Korea’s import of capital goods, equipment parts, fuel and raw materials seems to play the role of another input in the production process. Then it is reasonable to think the extended production function in North Korea, that includes North Korea’s import as another factor of production besides labor and capital elements. The extended production function model is used in this paper to empirically analyze the economic effect of the new resolution. Specifically this study investigates the effect on North Korea’s real GDP when the provision to prohibit North Korea’s export of coal, iron and iron ore causes the decrease in export revenue to be used for the payment of North Korea’s import.North Korea’s annual data ranging from 1980 to 2014 is used for the empirical analysis. Findings are as follows: first, when North Korea’s export of coal, iron and iron ore is prohibited, export revenue is decreased by about 150 million dollars, and the consequent decrease in North Korea’s import may result in about 7.6% drop in North Korea’s real GDP. Secondly, the decrease of cash income through the shut down of the Gaeseoung industrial complex is about 120 million dollars. Consequently it may cause about 0.6 drop in North Korea’s real GDP. Thirdly, even though the provision to prohibit the exportation of workers from North Korea is not included in the new resolution, it is likely that such a provision may be additionally included in the resolution if North Korea continues to commit military provocations. It is reported that North Korea may get about 300~500 million dollars annually from the exportation of workers. Then the prohibition of the exportation of North Korean workers may reduce North Korea’s real GDP by about 1.5~2.5%.All empirical findings about the economic effect of sanctions are just about the short run effect. Eventually the reduction in North Korea’s overall production through the decrease in North Korea’s import may affect the capacity of reproduction in the North Korean economy. In the long run, it damages the functioning of the North Korean economy seriously. It is expected that North Korea may respond to economic sanctions of the new resolution through the mobilization of domestic resources. Considering the current situation of the North Korean economy, without the institutionalization of North Korea’s market such as institutional guarantees of user rights or proprietary rights on production assets, it could not succeed in the efficient mobilization of domestic resources enough to overcome the economic downturn caused by Resolution 2270. In this respect, economic sanctions on Resolution 2270 may affect the economic transformation of the North Korean economy."
Recombinant Glargine Insulin Production Process Using Escherichia coli,2016,"['Diabetes', 'glargine', 'fed-batch fermentation', 'citraconylation', 'Arg (B31)-insulin']",,"Glargine insulin is a long-acting insulin analog that helps blood glucose maintenance in patients with diabetes. We constructed the pPT-GI vector to express prepeptide glargine insulin when transformed into Escherichia coli JM109. The transformed E. coli cells were cultured by fed-batch fermentation. The final dry cell mass was 18 g/l. The prepeptide glargine insulin was 38.52% of the total protein. It was expressed as an inclusion body and then refolded to recover the biological activity. To convert the prepeptide into glargine insulin, citraconylation and trypsin cleavage were performed. Using citraconylation, the yield of enzymatic conversion for glargine insulin increased by 3.2-fold compared with that without citraconylation. After the enzyme reaction, active glargine insulin was purified by two types of chromatography (ion-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase chromatography). We obtained recombinant human glargine insulin at 98.11% purity and verified that it is equal to the standard of human glargine insulin, based on High-performance liquid chromatography analysis and Matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. We thus established a production process for high-purity recombinant human glargine insulin and a method to block Arg (B31)-insulin formation. This established process for recombinant human glargine insulin may be a model process for the production of other human insulin analogs."
Bandwidth Allocation Under Multi-Level Service Guarantees of Downlink in the VLC-OFDM System,2016,"['Bandwidth allocation', 'VLC', 'OFDM', 'Effective capacity', 'Multi-level service guarantee']",,"In this paper, we explore a low-complex bandwidth allocation (BA) scheme with multi-level serviceguarantees in VLC-OFDM systems. Effective capacity theory, which evaluates wireless channel capacityfrom a novel view, is utilized to model the system capacity under delay QoS constraints of the link layer.Since intensity modulation of light is used in the system, problems caused by frequency selectivity canbe neglected. Then, the BA problem can be formulated as an integer programming problem and it is furtherrelaxed and transformed into a concave one. Lagrangian formulation is used to reformulate the concaveproblem. Considering the inefficiency of traditional gradient-based schemes and the demand for distributedimplementation in local area networks, we localize the global parameters and propose a quasi-distributedquadratic allocation algorithm to provide two-level service guarantees, the first level is QoS oriented, andthe second level is QoE oriented. Simulations have shown the efficient performance of the proposedalgorithm. The users with more stringent QoS requirements require more subcarriers to guarantee theirstatistical delay QoS requirements. We also analyze the effect of subcarrier granularity on the aggregateeffective capacity via simulations."
Decoupling of the Secondary Saliencies in Sensorless PMSM Drives using Repetitive Control in the Angle Domain,2016,"['CwSPMSM', 'Repetitive control', 'Secondary saliencies', 'Sensorless control']",,"To decouple the secondary saliencies in sensorless permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives, a repetitive control (RC) in the angle domain is proposed. In this paper, the inductance model of a concentrated windings surface-mounted PMSM (cwSPMSM) with strong secondary saliencies is developed. Due to the secondary saliencies, the estimated position contains harmonic disturbances that are periodic relative to the angular position. Through a transformation from the time domain to the angle domain, these varying frequency disturbances can be treated as constant periodic disturbances. The proposed angle-domain RC is plugged into an existing phase-locked loop (PLL) and utilizes the error of the PLL to generate signals to suppress these periodic disturbances. A stability analysis and parameter design guidelines of the RC are addressed in detail. Finally, the proposed method is carried out on a cwSPMSM drive test-bench. The effectiveness and accuracy are verified by experimental results."

A Coverage Algorithm for Multiple Autonomous Surface Vehicles in Flowing Environments,2016,"['Adaptive backstepping techniques', 'coverage control', 'Gaussian functions', 'multi-ASV systems.']",,"This paper is concerned with the coverage problem with multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) intime-varying flowing environment, where the interest information distribution is unknown to the coverage networks.While taking the model parameter uncertainty into consideration, a decentralized, adaptive control law is proposedsuch that the coverage network will converge to the optimal assigned region from arbitrary positions. For easeof exploration, we first investigate the static coverage problem of two-agent systems in flowing environment andpresent an example by extending the two-agent systems into the general case. In addition, Gaussian Estimationis introduced to predict the value of the sensory function through the sampled measurements. By using the staticcoverage partition as theoretical foundation, we transform the optimal coverage control into the moving targettracking problems, where the target is the centroid of the assigned region for each ASV. Based on these techniques,a decentralized kinematic control algorithm is developed to navigate the multi-ASV systems. Furthermore, theadaptive back-stepping techniques are employed to extend the kinematic controller into dynamic case with uncertainmodel parameters. Finally, simulation studies are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of theproposed approaches."
Genetic Parameters of Milk β-Hydroxybutyric Acid and Acetone and Their Genetic Association with Milk Production Traits of Holstein Cattle,2016,"['Ketosis', 'Milk  ${\\beta}$-Hydroxybutyrate', 'Milk Acetone', 'Milk Composition', 'Genetic Parameters']",,"This study was conducted to estimate the genetic parameters of ${\beta}$-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and acetone concentration in milk by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy along with test-day milk production traits including fat %, protein % and milk yield based on monthly samples of milk obtained as part of a routine milk recording program in Korea. Additionally, the feasibility of using such data in the official dairy cattle breeding system for selection of cows with low susceptibility of ketosis was evaluated. A total of 57,190 monthly test-day records for parities 1, 2, and 3 of 7,895 cows with pedigree information were collected from April 2012 to August 2014 from herds enrolled in the Korea Animal Improvement Association. Multi-trait random regression models were separately applied to estimate genetic parameters of test-day records for each parity. The model included fixed herd test-day effects, calving age and season effects, and random regressions for additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. Abundance of variation of acetone may provide a more sensitive indication of ketosis than many zero observations in concentration of milk BHBA. Heritabilities of milk BHBA levels ranged from 0.04 to 0.17 with a mean of 0.09 for the interval between 4 and 305 days in milk during three lactations. The average heritabilities for milk acetone concentration were 0.29, 0.29, and 0.22 for parities 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There was no clear genetic association of the concentration of two ketone bodies with three test-day milk production traits, even if some correlations among breeding values of the test-day records in this study were observed. These results suggest that genetic selection for low susceptibility of ketosis in early lactation is possible. Further, it is desirable for the breeding scheme of dairy cattle to include the records of milk acetone rather than the records of milk BHBA."

Thus, examining whether the reforms point to the decline or the re-establishment of the Korean tripartite system, which type of model of governance was employed to deal with the demands of business and labour, and how and why the political elites and bureaucrats pursued specific policies is equivalent to exploring what and who enabled the reform of the industrial relations."

First of all, I investigate how Rancière theoretically develops his model of critical art on the basis of his doctrines of ‘politics of aesthetics’ and ‘the aesthetic regime of art’, specifically how Rancière derives ‘a third (way of) aesthetic politics’ from tensions between two logics of aesthetic politics inherent on the politics of aesthetics, how this third aesthetic politics forms the theoretical backbone of Rancière’s critical art, and how such key notions as ‘dissensus’, ‘fiction’, and ‘equality’ in ‘the aesthetic regime of art’ make up strategic elements of Rancière’s theory of critical art. Second, I thereby deal with questions of how Rancière analyzes that critical art has shifted from the dialectical clash in the 1960s and 1970s to the co-presence of heterogeneous elements since the 1990s, and that contemporary art has transformed into its various forms such as ‘play’, ‘archive’, ‘relation’, and ‘mystery’, entering into the period of ‘consensus’. Lastly, I move on to discuss how Rancière’s belief in critical art - despite the era of the so-called ‘post-politics’ when scepticism on the possibility of critical art has been rampant - are at once shared by his contemporary theorists such as Chantal Mouffe and Alain Badiou, and also in contrast or conflict with them when it comes to such questions as ‘consensus and dissensus’, ‘activist art’, ‘the truth of art’, and ‘democracy’."

Since its +publication, DCF had been a lexicographic model especially for Korean-English dictionaries written by American-English missionaries and later had a direct or indirect impact on other foreign languages and Korean lexicography. However, DCF had not been widely used in Korean language studies because of its french definition. As DCF was partly built into 「Korean language history corpus」 of the 21st century Sejong Project between 1998-2007, it has been used in the various fields of the Korean studies after having been transformed into a raw corpus, that shows us how the Korean language was in 19th century. By proceeding a thematic classification of the research papers related to the DCF, this study aims to show how DCF is used in Korean literature and language studies in order to evaluate the influence of DCF to the field. As a result, we found that DCF is most frequently used as empirical data that allows to verify the lexical forms and semantic changes. Also, DCF had a substantial impact in understanding the Korean socio-cultural phenomena of the late 19th century."

While this transformation contains not only economic growth but also democratization and the quality of life, the compressed development raises some important questions: to what extent the Korean story can be accounted for? What really covers beneath the surface of the economic miracle? Much ink has been spilt in an effort to answer these provoking riddles by focusing on cultural residues and the role of IT as the driving engine of development. This study presents the basic matrix of three analytical dimensions in which developmental pathways can be revealed: ideology, analytical level, developmental arena. The power shift from state-sponsored growth to the quest for quality of life has taken the luster off the developmental model, though whether the previous model has outlived its effectiveness remains a matter of intense controversy. Despite the contrasting views, at the roots of Korean success story lie the dynamics of culture and its response to impacts of new IT development. A Korean culture that stresses creativity and hybrid ways of thinking, as well as its traditional catch up attitude, will be necessary for the country to pursue future development with the IT innovation."

Proposed hierarchical Fourier correlations are calculated by using range-reduced DFTs(discrete Fourier transforms) and these normalized cross-correlations. In MRF(Markov random field) model as energy-minimization problem, the normalized correlation is added to a part of the term of data cost in energy function. Then a better disparity map is obtained using energy minimization by BP(belief propagation). The performances are evaluated by RMS(root mean squared) error and percentage of bad matching pixels based on given GT(ground truth) data. Our experiments is implemented for stereo images and shows advantages of newly added term with the number of iterations. For real-time stereo systems, the proposed method can be implemented using FFT algorithm."

Its focus was on “transformational leadership” and “the level of policy practice” as management capacity of school principals, and the academic achievement and school satisfaction of students were selected as a measurement criterion for school effectiveness. Using the third-year data of Gyeonggi Education Panel Study (GEPS), the study was designed as a Level-2 Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM), and the data of 53 regular high schools and 3,235 students were analyzed. The results of the analysis indicated that the standard deviation between school principals for the academic achievement and school satisfaction of students was 29.253% and 9.832%, respectively, and that the difference between school principals concerning the academic achievement and school satisfaction of students was statistically significant even after controlling for student-level variables. It was confirmed that, among the variables affecting the management capacity of school principals, the level of practicing the education policy made a statistically significant difference, which indicates that the higher the level of school principals practicing the education policy, the higher the academic achievement and school satisfaction of students. From the results of this study, it is necessary that they arrange more structured training courses and strengthen the capabilities of practice in order to enhance the school principals’ understanding of education policy and their practice levels. It is also suggested that they establish the standards and institutions for checking the capabilities of school principals practicing the education policy and use them in selecting and placing them."

The optimum ratio to prepare PAN/FZ beads was 0.3 g of PAN to 0.3 g of FZ. The diameter of the prepared PAN/FZ beads was about 3 mm. Sr and Cu ion adsorption experiments were conducted with PAN/FZ beads. A pseudo-second-order model fit the kinetic data for Sr and Cu ion adsorption by PAN/FZ beads well. The equilibrium data fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model, and the maximum adsorption capacities were 96.5 mg/g and 74.6 mg/g for the Sr and Cu ions, respectively. Additionally, the values of thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs free energy (ΔG°), enthalpy (ΔH°) and entropy (ΔS°) were determined. The positive values of ΔH° revealed the endothermic nature of the adsorption process and the negative values of ΔGo were indicative of the spontaneity of the adsorption process."

As these have taken up increasing proportion of Corporate Korea’s human resources management, this phenomenon merits an in-depth analysis so as to see how non-regular workers influence corporate results.Our study shows that output based compensation and employment security hold a statistical meaning to ‘subjective’ financial results. Meanwhile, employment security pact, contrary to hypothesis, yields negative influence on subjective financial results. As for labor productivity, positive influence came up with output-based appraisal, job-analysis and employees participation. Our analysis looked for actual proofs in how HRM practices and moderating effect of irregular ratio affect corporate performance. It edifies that, if irregular workers take up a bigger proportion, such strategic HRM practices as formal training scheme, job descriptions, and employee participation became significant.Id est, the more irregular workers, the more useful are formal training programs and job descriptions; employees’ participation can be reflected into management plan with positive results.This study concludes as follows. A few HRM practices that had been considered as ‘best practice’ are now out of sync with today’s Corporate Korea as environments shifted; if irregular workers take up bigger proportion, universalistic HRM practices are called for to make a difference. Further to this study, we enumerated the four areas that need more research, and we came up with a layout of how our future research work will develop."

Music/Voice Separation Based on Kernel Back-Fitting Using Weighted β-Order MMSE Estimation,2016,"['Kernel back-fitting', 'separation', 'generalized weighted β-order MMSE estimation', 'singular value decomposition.']",,"Recent developments in the field of separation of mixed signals into music/voice components have attracted the attention of many researchers. Recently, iterative kernel back-fitting, also known as kernel additive modeling, was proposed to achieve good results for music/voice separation. To obtain minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimates of short-time Fourier transforms of sources, generalized spatial Wiener filtering (GW) is typically used. In this paper, we propose an advanced music/voice separation method that utilizes a generalized weighted β-order MMSE estimation (WbE) based on iterative kernel back-fitting (KBF). In the proposed method, WbE is used for the step of mixed music signal separation, while KBF permits kernel spectrogram model fitting at each iteration. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better separation performance than GW and existing Bayesian estimators."
Smad4 controls bone homeostasis through regulation of osteoblast/osteocyte viability,2016,[],,"Regulation of osteoblast and osteocyte viability is essential for bone homeostasis. Smad4, a major transducer of bone morphogenetic protein and transforming growth factor-β signaling pathways, regulates apoptosis in various cell types through a mitochondrial pathway. However, it remains poorly understood whether Smad4 is necessary for the regulation of osteoblast and osteocyte viability. In this study, we analyzed Smad4ΔOs mice, in which Smad4 was subjected to tissue-specific disruption under the control of the 2.3-kb Col1a1 promoter, to understand the functional significance of Smad4 in regulating osteoblast/osteocyte viability during bone formation and remodeling. Smad4ΔOs mice showed a significant increase in osteoblast number and osteocyte density in the trabecular and cortical regions of the femur, whereas osteoclast activity was significantly decreased. The proliferation of osteoblasts/osteocytes did not alter, as shown by measuring 5′-bromo-2′deoxyuridine incorporation. By contrast, the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells decreased, together with a decrease in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and in the proteolytic cleavage of caspase 3, in Smad4ΔOs mice. Apoptosis in isolated calvaria cells from Smad4ΔOs mice decreased after differentiation, which was consistent with the results of the TUNEL assay and western blotting in Smad4ΔOs mice. Conversely, osteoblast cells overexpressing Smad4 showed increased apoptosis. In an apoptosis induction model of Smad4ΔOs mice, osteoblasts/osteocytes were more resistant to apoptosis than were control cells, and, consequently, bone remodeling was attenuated. These findings indicate that Smad4 has a significant role in regulating osteoblast/osteocyte viability and therefore controls bone homeostasis."

Angle of repose and percentage drug release in 30 min were selected as dependent variables. The liquisolid systems were prepared using Solutol HS-15 in combination of Synperonic PE/ L61 in ratio of 1:1 as non-volatile liquid, Neusilin US2 as carrier and Aerosil 200 as coating material. The relationship between dependent and independent variables were further explicated through regression analysis and response surface plots. Prepared systems were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction studies. Invitro dissolution results revealed significant enhancement in drug release properties from the formulations. Physicochemical characterization of liquisolid systems proposed reduction in drug crystallinity which might be ascribed for improvement in dissolution properties.

TFAP2C-mediated upregulation of TGFBR1 promotes lung tumorigenesis and epithelial–mesenchymal transition,2016,[],,"TFAP2C (transcription factor-activating enhancer-binding protein 2C) expression has been positively correlated with poor prognosis in patients with certain types of cancer, but the mechanisms underlying TFAP2C-mediated tumorigenesis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still unknown. We previously performed a microarray analysis to identify TFAP2C regulation genes, and TGFBR1 (transforming growth factor-β receptor type 1) was found to be upregulated by TFAP2C. We observed that TFAP2C or TGFBR1 overexpression led to oncogenic properties, such as cell viability, proliferation and cell cycle progression. TGFBR1 upregulation induced by TFAP2C also promoted cell motility and migration, leading to malignant development. We also found that PAK1 (p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 1) signaling was involved in TFAP2C/ TGFBR1-induced tumorigenesis. These results were confirmed by an in vivo xenograft model and patient tissue samples. This study shows that TFAP2C promoted tumor progression by upregulation of TGFBR1 and consequent activation of PAK1 signaling."

Acid functionalized nanoporous carbon was explored for use in removal of toxic Cr(VI) ions from aqueous media. An adsorption study was done as a function of initial concentration, pH, contact time, temperature, and interfering ions. The experimental equilibrium data fits well to Langmuir isotherm model with maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 35.335 mg/g. The results indicated that removal obeys a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and that equilibrium was reached in 10 min. A desorption study was done using NaOH. The results of the present study imply that acid functionalized nanoporous carbon synthesized from grass is an efficient, renewable, cost-effective adsorbent material for removal of hexavalent chromium due to its faster removal rate and reusability."

In this context, this study attempts to suggest how IT technology can be efficiently harnessed through the usage of mobile devices in the planning stage of fashion materials, where the initial production plan of a clothing item is mapped out. This study ultimately aims to enhance the effectiveness of databases on fashion material information by using mobile devices to utilize NFC, an RFID technology having as much revolutionary power as Internet . which can be the convergence between IT and fashion across the software dimensions. To pursue this research, data on fashion material information regarding 200 woven fabric specimens were provided by textile companies. The information includes elements such as its composition, weight, width, yarn, density and sales report. These pieces of information were organized into a database. Drawing on this data, Android-based applications that allow smart phones to read off fabric information from NFC tags were developed for this study using two methods. The system works as follows: 1. NFC tag stickers are attached onto the hangers where 200 fabric samples are hanging. 2. The NFC tag stickers are tagged, or read off from a smart phone that support NFC functions. 3. Upon tagging, the Smart phone swiftly displays all information available on its screen - not only the aforementioned six elements, but also the image of the clothing item from the fabric in its finalized product form, and the video of the model wearing the item. for convenient view. The method harbors immense potential for the fashion industry in general, and will also be useful in those fields inside the industry that harness NFC technology."

Their immunomodulatory activity was evaluated with an in vitro cell model (RAW264.7 cells). In vivo immunomodulatory activity of RPS-2 was evaluated in normal and cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppressed mice. The results showed that the molecular weights of RPS-1, RPS-2, and RPS-3 were 600, 990, and 1300 kDa, respectively. RPS-1 and RPS-2 were mainly composed of galactose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, and glucuronic acid, while RPS-3 was mainly composed of galactose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, and glucose. FT-IR and NMR spectrum data indicated a rhamnogalacturonan I characteristic of polysaccharide. Both RPS and its purified fractions RPS-1, RPS-2, and RPS-3 significantly increased RAW264.7 cell proliferation, nitric oxide (NO) production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and interleukin (IL)-10 secretion (P < .05). The purified fraction RPS-2 also increased the spleen index, splenocyte proliferation, and cytokine secretion in vivo. These results indicate that okra polysaccharides may potentially serve as novel immunomodulators."

In this study, the use and stability of barcodecontaining exoelectrogenic model biofilms under non-axenic wastewater treatment conditions are described. Genomic barcodes were integrated in Shewanella oneidensis, Geobacter sulfurreducens, and G. metallireducens. These barcodes are unique for each strain and allow distinction between those cells and naturally occurring wild types as well as quantification of the amount of cells in a biofilm via multiplex qPCR. MFCs were pre-incubated with these three strains, and after 6 days the anodes were transferred into MFCs containing synthetic wastewater with 1% wastewater sludge. Over time, the system stabilized and the coulomb efficiency was constant. Overall, the initial synthetic biofilm community represented half of the anodic population at the end of the experimental timeline. The part of the community that contained a barcode was dominated by G. sulfurreducens cells (61.5%), while S. oneidensis and G. metallireducens cells comprised 10.5% and 17.9%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the stability of a synthetic exoelectrogenic consortium under non-axenic conditions. The observed stability offers new possibilities for the application of synthetic biofilms and synthetically engineered organisms fed with non-sterile waste streams."
Linear Quadratic Regulation and Tracking using Output Feedback with Direct Feedthrough,2016,"['Direct feedthrough', 'Linear quadratic', 'Regulation and Tracking', 'Output feedback']",,"This paper presents the development of linear quadratic regulation and output tracking algorithms using output feedback when both the measurement and performance output equations contain direct feedthrough terms. Although all physical systems can be modeled without direct feedthrough, there are still many situations where system models with direct feedthrough are important. For this situation, we modify previous work on the same topic for systems without direct feedthrough. It is shown that for the regulation problem, the optimal output feedback gain for a direct feedthrough case can be directly obtained, via a transformation, from the approach used for systems without direct feedthrough. However, for the tracking problem, a new set of coupled matrix equations for determining the optimal output feedback gain is derived from the necessary conditions for minimizing the cost function. The effectiveness of the developed algorithms is demonstrated using numerical examples."
Aerodynamic load maps of bluff bodies: Measurement and diagnostics,2016,"['Aerodynamic', 'Bluff', 'Body', 'Generalized', 'Load', 'Prediction']",,"Bluff bodies may assume arbitrary attitudes in a flow, causing aerodynamic loads that are sensitive to attitude. The Continuous rotation technique obtains 6-component loads on bluff bodies with 1-degree azimuth resolution about selected axes at a rate of 1 revolution per minute. The load coefficient variation is Fourier transformed and the resulting complex series is truncated in order to obtain rapidly computable, analytical formulae. The method is applied to bluff body shapes including cylinders, a cuboid, a flat plate and a porous box. A cylinder whose length is equal to its diameter, is used to show that rate effects, hysteresis, vortex shedding and other unsteady aerodynamic phenomena are negligible below 10 revolutions per minute. Approaches to generalize the aerodynamic loads on yawed finite cylinders of various aspect ratio are studied. The reasons for differences in aerodynamic load behavior between 2 cylinder models, are analyzed. To complement experiments, the ROTCFD unsteady Navier Stokes code is used to perform diagnostic computations. Methods to generalize the predictions are explored. Maps of the leading coefficients of the Fourier series of each load component over the aspect ratios space, are interpolated. The interpolation varies sharply for aspect ratios between 0.5 to 1. The variation is more gradual beyond aspect ratio 2. By aspect ratio 4, a ‘high aspect ratio’ limit appears to be reached."

Application of Fisher's Equation on the Korea's Open Economy using System Dynamics,2016,"['양적 완화', '피셔 교환방정식', '시스템 동학', '무역수지', '먼델-토빈 효과', 'Quantitative Easing', ""Fisher's Equation of Exchange"", 'System Dynamics', 'Trade Balance', 'Mundell-Tobin Effect']",,"The goal of this paper is to find the optimal level of quantitative easing in order to overcome the economic crisis. This paper uses the system dynamics approach technically and the Fisher's equation of exchange theoretically for the diagnosis of the present Korea's economy. The simulation model is constructed through the non-linear simultaneous function for the long-term prediction. The first thing that has to be done is to find the trend functions of the determinants of the Fisher's equation, and then to construct the non-linear simultaneous function through the combination of the functions.The results of simulation give some implications. The quantitative easing is divided into natural and political monetary easing. The political monetary easing is not necessary for the reflationary policy of real estate  market, but important for the betterment of trade balance that can cause the industry growth.The log-transformed variables are used for the simulation and statistic analysis. After calculating the optimal level of money expansion, the logarithmic values are converted into the real values.Korea's economy is small in the whole international economy, but the effect of Korea's monetary policy on the trade balance isn't diminutive. Therefore, the Korea's monetary policy can lead the industry growth in the export-oriented economy and be an alternative to solve the financial crisis in the Korea's economy by improving the Korea's trade balance."

The polynomial models developed by RSM for pH, solubility and yield were highly effective in describing the relationships between factors (P<0.05). Increased molar ratios of calcined powder (BCCP) from butter clam shell led to reduced solubility, yield, color values and overall quality. The critical values of multiple response optimization to independent variables were 1.75 M and 0.94 M for lactic acid and BCCP, respectively. The actual values (pH 7.23, 97.42% for solubility and 423.22% for yield) under optimization conditions were similar to the predicted values. White indices of BCCLs were in the range of 86.70–90.86. Therefore, organic acid treatment improved color value. The buffering capacity of BCCLs was strong, at pH 2.82 to 3.80, upon the addition of less than 2 mL of 1 N HCl. The calcium content and solubility of BCCLs were 6.2–16.7 g/100 g and 93.6-98.5%, respectively. Fourier transform analysis of infrared spectroscopy data identified BCCL as calcium lactate pentahydrate, and the analysis of microstructure by field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed an irregular form."

"Globalization, Cultural Traditions, and Adolescents’ Value Orientations",2016,"['Globalization', 'Adolescents’ Value Orientations', 'Cultural Traditions', 'Cross-national research']",,"Using data on eight-grade adolescents surveyed in the 2009 International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS), this paper investigates whether globalization can have an impact on adolescents’ value orientations from an aggregate cross-national perspective. The results of two-level hierarchical linear models (HLM) refute the hyperglobalist thesis for the universal convergence of values as a result of globalization, i.e., more globalized countries are characterized by the declining relevance of traditional markers of identity (e.g., nationality and religion) and their replacement with values that are more democratic and tolerant. Rather, findings lend support to the skeptical and transformative theses that focus on the enduring influence of cultural traditions on adolescents’ value systems. Adolescents’ supports for democratic values and immigrant rights do not vary across countries in accordance with the level of globalization. The influence of a country’s cultural tradition on adolescents’ attitudes toward religion, nation-states, and gender equality persists, even after controlling for the effect of globalization. A supplementary analysis also reveals that what conditions the effect of globalization on adolescents’ value orientations is economic development rather than democratic advancement."

Imperial Japan""s general mobilization system was a social system for war which the military and government authorities constructed, comparing with the western model after analyzing the patterns of total war that emerged from the First World War. The authorities started the reorganization of ‘home front’ and ideological manipulation at an earlier stage, in order to overcome the inferiority for material resources and economic power, and supplement the immature patriotism(devoid of civil consciousness). How the functional or local organizations were organized and managed by government-sponsored movements could be a good measure in evaluating the characteristics of Japanese version of totalitarianism. More detailed research should be conducted in the future as to how local organization such as Buraku-kai were transformed and mobilized in wartime. In the respect of ideological manipulation, a unique statism such as the ideology of ‘Imperial Way’, ‘Kokutairon (國體論)’, ‘Japanese spirits’ were circulated widely. Careful reconsideration is needed about invented or adapted culture in the context of war such as Bushido. In the formation of social system, culture, academic discipline, the experience of military mobilization is irreversible. Looking into the cultural legacy of military mobilization in various postwar histories through concepts such as emulation, transplant, continuity, distortion, revival can be a kind of work for the anthropology of war."

Cu2+ ion reduction in wastewater over RDF-derived char,2016,"['adsorption', 'activation', 'char', 'pyrolysis']",,"Refuse-derived fuel (RDF) produced using municipal solid waste was pyrolyzed to produce RDF char. For the first time, the RDF char was used to remove aqueous copper, a representative heavy metal water pollutant. Activation of the RDF char using steam and KOH treatments was performed to change the specific surface area, pore volume, and the metal cation quantity of the char. N2 sorption, Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the char. The optimum pH for copper removal was shown to be 5.5, and the steam-treated char displayed the best copper removal capability. Ion exchange between copper ions and alkali/alkaline metal cations was the most important mechanism of copper removal by RDF char, followed by adsorption on functional groups existing on the char surface. The copper adsorption behavior was represented well by a pseudo-second-order kinetics model and the Langmuir isotherm. The maximum copper removal capacity was determined to be 38.17 mg/g, which is larger than those of other low-cost char adsorbents reported previously."
Free Vibration Analysis of a Steel T-Shape Frame Including Semi-rigid Khorjini Connection with Continuous Beam,2016,"['Free vibration analysis', 'T-shape frame', 'semi-rigid Khorjini connection', 'Boundary condition', 'Euler-Bernoulli beam', 'Rotational spring']",,"This article deals with the free vibration analysis and determination of seismic parameters of a T-Shape frame which consists of a continuous beam and a column connected to each other by means of a semi-rigid Khorjini connection. The individual members of the frame are assumed to be governed by the transverse vibration theory of an Euler-Bernoulli beam and the semirigid Khorjini connection is modeled employing a rotational spring. First of all, a closed-form solution is proposed and then, a numerical analysis is performed for some comparison and validation purposes. The closed-form solution is developed by solving the frame equations of motion, directly. For this reason, some mathematical techniques such as Fourier transform and the well-known complementary solutions are utilized. In this process, some differential equations must be solved, and several boundary conditions should be satisfied. Afterward, the free vibration parameters of the frame are attained. These parameters are also obtained using finite element method as a numerical analysis and it is observed that the results obtained by this approach are completely coincident with the result of closed-form solution. Also, seismic parameters of the frame and seismic behavior of the semi-rigid Khorjini connection for different cases are investigated and their results are compared. Finally, two special cases are presented and, furthermore, the connection mass effect on system frequency is investigated."

Rhus verniciflua Stokes attenuates cholestatic liver cirrhosis-induced interstitial fibrosis via Smad3 down-regulation and Smad7 up-regulation,2016,"['Rhus verniciflua Stokes', 'Cholestatic liver cirrhosis', 'Bile duct ligation']",,"Cholestatic liver cirrhosis (CLC) eventually proceeds to end-stage liver failure by mediating overwhelming deposition of collagen, which is produced by activated interstitial myofibroblasts. Although the beneficial effects of Rhus verniciflua Stokes (RVS) on various diseases are well-known, its therapeutic effect and possible underlying mechanism on interstitial fibrosis associated with CLC are not elucidated. This study was designed to assess the protective effects of RVS and its possible underlying mechanisms in rat models of CLC established by bile duct ligation (BDL). We demonstrated that BDL markedly elevated the serological parameters such as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin, all of which were significantly attenuated by the daily uptake of RVS (2 mg/kg/day) for 28 days (14 days before and after operation) via intragastric route. We observed that BDL drastically induced the deterioration of liver histoarchitecture and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), both of which were significantly attenuated by RVS. In addition, we revealed that RVS inhibited BDL-induced proliferation and activation of interstitial myofibroblasts, a highly suggestive cell type for ECM production, as shown by immunohistochemical and semi-quantitative detection of a-smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Finally, we demonstrated that the anti-fibrotic effect of RVS was associated with the inactivation of Smad3, the key downstream target of a major fibrogenic cytokine, i.e., transforming growth factor b (TGF-b). Simultaneously, we also found that RVS reciprocally increased the expression of Smad7, a negative regulatory protein of the TGF-b/Smad3 pathway. Taken together, these results suggested that RVS has a therapeutic effect on CLC, and these effects are, at least partly, due to the inhibition of liver fibrosis by the downregulation of Smad3 and upregulation of Smad7."

The Br-terminated chain ends of the resulting polymer in one end were transformed to azido groups (OH-PMEO2MA-N3) and subsequently the OH-terminated chain ends in the other end were transformed to 4-nitrophenyl formate-derivated group (NPC-PMEO2MA-N3 ). A model protein, cationized bovine serum albumin (cBSA) was reacted with 4-nitrophenyl formate groups of NPC-PMEO2MA-N3 to form cBSA-PMEO2MA-N3 . The click reaction between azido-terminated cBSA-PMEO2MA-N3 and alkyne-derived bovine serum albumin (BSAalkyne ) yielded novel cBSA-PMEO2MA-BSA bioconjugates with two proteins at both polymer ends."

It is also interesting to see how South Korea could have exploited for its new cultural drives the emerging new global dynamics and trends of mass culture, which are fueled by the economic, technological and cultural developments of the globalization. The new korean export hits should not be explained alone in economic terms. In my opinion the korean soft power is also the expression of self confidence, optimism and cultural patriotism of the young korean generation."
실시간 철도 안전관제를 위한 DDS 기반의 일반철도 신호 데이터 규격 설계 연구,2016,[],,"The real-time railway safety monitoring and control system is for prevention of safety accidents, and this system adopts DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard based data transmission method to support integrated management of data from existing on-site safety detection devices. In this paper, we introduce the design of DDS-based data specification from on-site signal equipment on the conventional railway. For this, we (1) design UML data model of KRS SG 0062 standard which defines existing data specification, (2) define DDS Topics for DDS transmission and map KRS model to DDS Topic model, (3) suggest data transformation rules and (4) design network control QoS polices. In addition, we analysis actual on-site log data and validate our data specification design. DDS-based data transmission enables data compatibility among on-site devices and the real-time railway safety monitoring and control system, and allows efficient network management for a large amount of data transfer."
Design and Implementation of a Data Extraction Tool for Analyzing Software Changes,2016,"['Data extraction', 'Change analysis', 'Code ownership', 'Mining software repositories']",,"In this paper, we present a novel approach to help MSR researchers obtain necessary data with a tool, termed General Purpose Extractor for Source code (GPES). GPES has a single function extracts high-quality data, e.g., the version history, abstract syntax tree (AST), changed code diff, and software quality metrics. Moreover, features such as an AST of other languages or new software metrics can be extended easily given that GPES has a flexible data model and a component-based design. We conducted several case studies to evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of our tool. Case studies show that researchers can reduce the overall cost of data analysis by transforming the data into the required formats."

Visible near infrared spectroscopy, one of soil prediction methods, has been applied to predict several soil properties with effective costs, rapid and nondesctructive analysis, and satisfactory accuracy. Spectral preprocessing is a essential procedure to correct noisy spectra for visible near infrared spectroscopy. However, there are no attempts to evaluate various spectral preprocessing methods. We tested 5 different pretreatments, namely continuum removal, Savitzky-Golay filter, discrete wavelet transform, 1st derivative, and 2nd derivative to predict soil carbon(C) and nitrogen(N). Partial least squares regression was used for the prediction method. The total of 153 soil samples was split into 122 samples for calibration and 31 samples for validation. In the all range, absorption was increased with increasing C contents. Specifically, the visible region (650nm and 700nm) showed high values of the correlation coefficient with soil C and N contents. For spectral preprocessing methods, continuum removal had the highest prediction accuracy(Root Mean Square Error) for C(9.53mg/g) and N(0.79mg/g). Therefore, continuum removal was selected as the best preprocessing method. Additionally, there were no distinct differences between Savitzky-Golay filter and discrete wavelet transform for visual assessment and the methods showed similar validation results. According to the results, we also recommended Savitzky-Golay filter that is a simple pre-treatment with continuum removal."

A method to detect high-resistance ground fault accidents by converting the fault current into visual data and applying the CNN technique to this is presented and verified. The data for learning the CNN technique was generated through simulation of the model system. Simulations were performed for data generation by changing the fault resistance, the size, location of faults and amount of distributed power generation, in the case of a high-resistance ground fault and an increase in load in the model system. The generated data was transformed into graphic data by applying Morlett wavelet transform, and then learning was performed by applying CNN. As a result of the learning, high-resistance ground faults were identified with 98.29% accuracy, and a protective algorithm including this result that can respond to high-resistance ground faults occurring in the distribution system was proposed."

Seit der Wiedervereinigung 1990 wurden die Verwaltungsreformen in Deutschland auf verschiedene Weise betrachtet. In erster Linie wurden unternehmerische Organisationsmethoden in den Verwaltungsprozess eingeführt, die als eine Strategie um die Effektivität und Effizienz der Regierung zu erhöhen, vorgesehen sind. Jedoch wurden seit den 2000er Jahren die Veränderungen und die allgemeine Richtung interner Verwaltungsfragestellungen in letzter Zeit zunehmend zusammen mit den Herausforderungen der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie diskutiert. Politische, finanzielle, ökonomische und gesellschaftliche Fragen standen dabei im Mittelpunkt der Analyse. Die finanziellen und politischen Faktoren bestimmten größtenteils den Verwaltungsreformprozess, aber im Rahmen der Erhöhung der Verwaltungs- und Sozialausgaben scheinen andere ökonomische und soziale Faktoren einen bedeutenden Einfluss auf den Gesamtverlauf der Verwaltungsreformen und auf deren Veränderungen zu haben. Ein typisches Beispiel einer Verwaltungsreform kann im Land Brandenburg gefunden werden. Die Landesregierung Brandenburgs versuchte ein neues Modell für eine Verwaltungsreform zu etablieren, dass durch drastische Umstrukturierung und Verkleinerung des Organisationswesens zur Vereinfachung der Verwaltungsabläufe beitragen sollte. In diesem Fall wurden die Kernelemente der Verwaltungsreformen auf der Grundlage politischer Unterstützung und Bestrebungen verwirklicht. Trotz vieler Herausforderungen wie zum Beispiel der Wegzug großer Teile der Bevölkerung nach Westen, gelang es der Landesregierung durch zahlreiche Diskussionen und Treffen, bei denen die Meinungen der politischen Kontrahenten, die Verantwortung tragen, ausgetauscht wurden, die Konflikte zu minimieren, die aus dem Umstrukturierungsprozess der Gemeinden und Verwaltungseinheiten resultierten."

This paper examines the implications of convergence on Christian scholarship, focusing on the relationship between science and religion. For this purpose, I will examine, first, how the discussions about convergence began in Korea. I will then briefly examine the relationship between science and religion, based on the four models - conflict, independence, dialogue and integration - suggested by Ian Barbour. I will discuss differences and similarities between convergence and the relationship between science and religion. I will also discuss the implications of the convergence trend worldwide in the long term on the relationship between science and Christianity, focusing on three issues - transhumanism, neuroscience and singularity. The converging trends in life science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence and nano-technology will make it possible to substantially transform the human body and mind in the not-too-distant future. Based on this possibility, transhumanism emerged, dreaming of creating a new humankind. Transhumanism deconstructs the conditions of being human defined by modern humanism and explores open possibilities of creating a new humankind. This will be a grave challenge to the Christian worldview. Rapid development of neuroscience, on the other hand, gives another serious challenge to the Christian concept of soul. Followers of neuroscience deny the existence of soul and claim there is no difference between human mind and machine mind. The development of artificial intelligence will surely be accelerated as a present pace of development suggests. As a result, the time of singularity will come, whereas artificial intelligence exceeds human intelligence. The followers of singularity are dreaming of the fusion of human mind and artificial intelligence, resulting the explosive development of a new intelligent being. According to this vision, human beings, after singularity, will emerge as an omniscient, omnipotent and living-forever being. Materialism lies behind all these radical visions, talking about reinventing human nature, rejecting the existence of soul and suggesting singularity. Materialism, taking advantage of science and technology in this age of science and technology, will remain as a real threat to the Christianity."

Eleanor, however, transformed it into an institution of the American political system, dramatizing her actions through constant exposure via newspapers, magazines and radios. She used her access to the emerging power of the mass media to present herself as a model of political womanhood for the 20th Century. She represented the rising power of the American woman in the 20th Century. In addition, she transformed the role of First Lady with her ``primal leadership`` in American history. As First Lady, she was willing to use her public position to push for reform and social welfare. In her public communications Eleanor demonstrated an extraordinary ability to reach out to ordinary citizens, gaining respect and recognition from all Americans."

According to this study, firstly, public mental hospitals need to develop standard treatments models and to ensure emergency admission services to enhance deinstitutionalization of persons with mental illness. Secondly, ensuring financial incentives for short admission is important to decrease long-term admission by private hospitals. Thirdly, transformation of long term care facility into psychiatric elderly nursing home is necessary. Fourthly, psychiatric rehabilitation centers need to enhance independent living support services. Fifthly, community mental health centers need to build more integrated mental health system. Lastly, governments need to be firmly committed to deinstitutionalization policy and to use effective policy measures."
Phase Formation and Mechanical Properties of Cu-Zr-Ti Bulk Metallic Glass Composites,2016,"['bulk metallic glass composites', 'mechanical properties', 'crystal plasticity', 'compression test', 'b2 phase']",,"The effect of the type of the crystalline phase and its volume fraction on the mechanical property ofCu50Zr50-xTix alloys (x = 0-10) bulk metallic glass composites has been investigated in this study. Up to 6at% of Ti, B19’ phase particles distributed in the glassy matrix, while at 8 and 10% of Ti, B2 phase particlesare retained in the glass matrix due to suppression of the eutectoid transformation of B2 phase and byavoidance of martensitic transformation of B2 into B19’. The volume fraction of crystalline phase is stronglydependent on the cooling rate. The larger volume fraction of the crystalline phases results in the loweryield stress, the higher plastic strain, and the more pronounced work hardening behavior. At the crystallinevolume fraction below ~30%, the variation of the yield strength can be described by the rule of mixturemodel (ROM), while at the crystalline volume fraction higher than ~50% by the load-bearing model (LBM).At the crystal fractions between 30 and 50%, there is a yield strength drop and a transition from the ROMto the LBM. This transition is due to the formation of the crystalline structural framework at higher crystalfraction."
C-terminal-truncated HBV X promotes hepato-oncogenesis through inhibition of tumor-suppressive β-catenin/BAMBI signaling,2016,[],,"C-terminal-truncated hepatitis B virus (HBV) X (HBx) (ctHBX) is frequently detected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through HBV integration into the host genome. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ctHBx-associated oncogenic signaling have not yet been clarified. To elucidate the biological role of ctHBx in hepato-oncogenesis, we functionally analyzed ctHBx-mediated regulation of the activin membrane-bound inhibitor bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) through transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) or β-catenin (CTNNB1) in HCC cells and in an animal model, and we compared its role to that of the full-length HBx protein. Ectopic ctHBx expression generated more colonies in anchorage-dependent and -independent growth assays than did HBx expression alone. ctHBx downregulated BAMBI to a greater degree than did HBx in HCC cells. HBx activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which positively regulated the BAMBI expression through T-cell factor 1 signaling, whereas ctHBx negatively regulated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. BAMBI downregulated the β-catenin and TGF-β1 signaling pathways. TGF-β1 positively regulated BAMBI expression thorough Smad3 signaling.Furthermore, knockdown of BAMBI was more tumorigenic in HCC cells. Therefore, downregulation of both β-catenin and TGF-β1 signaling by BAMBI might contribute to tumor suppression in mice xenotransplanted with HepG2 or SH-J1 cells. Taken together, ctHBx may have a more oncogenic role than HBx through its inhibition of tumor-suppressive β-catenin/BAMBI signaling."

In order to perform the time domain analysis focused on the contact and friction, the entire model of the hull and tank was condensed with DOF reduction technique, which is obtained by transforming the global finite element model into its quasi-static modal coordinate. Modal analysis using the quasi-static deformation modes is chosen as a cost effective time domain simulation method and this is based on the fact that the structural response of the tank is quasi-static. Based on the developed cost effective time domain simulation method, the long-term fatigue analysis procedure for the structural details near the rolling chock and key of independent type tank is targeted to be established. The developed fatigue assessment procedure takes into account, wave induced stress and both contact and friction induced stress without loss of accuracy."
The rise of the Internet of Things and its potential impacts on consumers and society,2016,"['Internet of Things', 'digital culture', 'security participation', 'human experience']",,"Recently, a technical and technological term, the “Internet of Things,” became a buzzword in newspapers, government institutions, and in academe. The new technology is getting a response similar to that inspired by the emergence of groundbreaking technologies such as the Internet and Web 2.0. Journalists and policymakers are offering positive forecasts about how the Internet of Things (IoT) will transform our lives, businesses, and public services. Academic articles in engineering and business offer detailed technical and technological information and requirements and discuss possible new business models and the transformation of the industrial structure. Although it has been commercially introduced to markets for daily use, the rapid development of the technology suggests that more complex services and products will soon dominate the markets. Previous research and newspaper articles predict that this advance will be integrated into large parts of our lives and that its impacts on people will be enormous. Given that substantial effects on consumers and society are predicted, the lack of discussion about the issue is worrying. Therefore, we need to carefully examine the consumer and social impacts of the new technology instead of simply celebrating it. We thus explore concerns about the effects of IoT technology on consumers and society, drawing on critical studies of digital culture and the business and management literature. We find that there are three issues to consider in the age of IoT: security, individuality, and commodification. We argue that the development of IoT technology should be based on security for privacy, encouraging autonomy, and offering sovereignty to participants. Its development should not be about the security to govern, the subordination of people to the technology, or promoting corporate capitalism. We therefore conclude that a serious discussion about the impacts of IoT is needed in order to understand how it is going to shape our future."
A new converter for improving efficiency of multi-actuators fluid power system,2016,"['Fluid power converter', 'Switching hydraulic system', 'Energy efficient', 'Mobile robot']",,"This paper is concerned with the application of energy efficient fluid power in mobile robots system and proposes a new fluid power converter system which is analogous to a boost converter in power electronics. The fluid power converter system is based on the principle of pulse-width modulation. The fluid power converter has an effect akin to an electrical switched inductance transformer, wherein the output pressure or flow rate can be stepped up or down. Using an inductive reactance device (an inertia mass-block), the output flow and pressure can be varied to meet the load by a means that does not rely on dissipation of power (the resistance control). The simulation model based on the mathematics models of the components is built to analyse the performance of the fluid power converter. It is clearly shown that the fluid power converter has higher energy efficiency than conventional resistance control manners."

Istanbul is a city which had an extremely great influence on Orhan Pamuk's works and in which most of his works were set, making literary field investigation on it effective for understanding Orhan Pamuk and his works. Especially unlike the spaces Pamuk transformed and created in his works of fiction, actual spaces were reflected in Istanbul: Memories and the City according to the autobiographical nature of the work, offering an advantage in a sense that the field investigations on the city can let people experience the literary spaces from the work more vividly.Various literary spaces in Istanbul are more than just spaces in Pamuk's novels; they are the spaces in which the author was born and has lived to date and which have been settings of his diverse works. Hence, making field investigations on various parts of the city described in his works is one of the ways to understand the past and future of the author and Istanbul.In programs for students, encouraging students to understand the author alongside the anthropogeographical traits of the region related to the author's work by appropriately arranging the author's biographical factors and the historical, literary, geographical, and cultural inheritance-related factors of the region should precede. For deepening and expanding knowledge in the course of education, it would be desirable for the lecturers and students to participate together in activities including planning, executing, and evaluating the field investigations on literary spaces.However, as the subject of this study, Istanbul, is a city in a foreign country—which means that visiting the region can be difficult for some students—development of teaching materials and aids for achieving similar effects without an actual field investigation is necessary. Overcoming the limitations of two-dimensional contents for literary education can only be possible through proposing and actively utilizing various models of educational contents in the sphere of the humanities by preparing contents from multiple angles. With that as the basis, inducing the combination of literary space resources in which literature and space are combined and culture industry will contribute to the development of culture industry in a comprehensive sense."

Using this model, its performance was analyzed with different thickness and size of windows by comparing between flexural capacity of window glass with the device and without the device. From the results, the design table for installation of the window protective device was suggested. By comparing capacity of a window glass to wind load that is transformed from wind speed, the installation of the device is decided if the window can be protected by the device.

Nevertheless, both the causes which give rise to new governance movement and the benefits which new governance would bring to the traditional government structure and regulatory regime, its deliberative and participatory device and process of enhancing transparency and accountability of the actors in decision-making, lead us to expect the possibility of new governance to transform traditional constitutional law and legal regime, even though new governance is not to be applied to every area of public policy and the concept of constitutional law and traditional legal regulation continue to be needed and take an important role in social change with new governance mechanism.New governance has been employed in policy making and administrative process of not only national, regional and local government but also international organization in its diverse forms including Korea. In modern states which can be characterized as democratic constitutional, administrative, and welfare state, new governance seeks participatory and deliberative democracy and has been expected to implement principle of democracy and rule of law(rechtsstaat principle) in more creative and flexible ways, and also it has been asserted that new governance has presented its possibility which active fundamental rights of the people might be more affirmatively and directly realized. However, the selection of the non-state actors to participate in and their decision through new governance program have revealed the problems and difficulties of fairness, transparency, and democratic legitimacy which are components of principle of democracy and rectsstaat as well. New governance, competing, supplementing and transforming traditional legal regulation as well as directed and limited by the latter and most of all, also allowed by constitutional law would bring new insight and ways to ensure democratic legitimacy and accountability of government in modern administrative government era. Moreover, it is expected that new governance will make a difference in understanding and realizing positive right in constitutional law."
The statistical optimization of bacterial cellulose production via semi-continuous operation mode,2016,['Bacterial cellulose Optimization Fermentation Semi-continuous culture Response surface methodology (RSM)'],,"Bacterial cellulose (BC) is highly pure and has a higher crystallinity and molecular weight than plantcellulose. Therefore, BC can be used in many different areas such as biotechnology, pharmaceutical,cosmetics. Because of the price of BC, the productivity of BC is an important parameter for industrial scaleapplications. In this study, BC was produced in static culture using a semi-continuous operation mode;the conditions were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The collected BC wascharacterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),and tensile strength. Optimization parameters were selected as glucose concentration, surface area/volume ratio, surface area and incubation day intervals. The optimum values for incubation dayintervals, volume changing ratios, glucose concentrations and surface area/volume ratios were 7 days,66%, 50 g/L and 1.22 cm 1, respectively. BC productivity reached 0.284 g/L/day under optimalconditions, while the model equation proposed 0.289 g/L/day. RSM is essential for determining theoptimum values of parameters for BC production compared with the one-variable-at-a-time method.The semi-continuous operation mode is alternative and a good candidate for the industrial scaleproduction of BC."
Semi-active control of vibrations of spar type floating offshore wind turbines,2016,"['floating offshore wind turbine', 'spar-type', 'edgewise vibration', 'tuned mass damper', 'semi-active control']",,"A semi-active algorithm for edgewise vibration control of the spar-type floating offshore wind turbine (SFOWT) blades, nacelle and spar platform is developed in this paper. A tuned mass damper (TMD) is placed in each blade, in the nacelle and on the spar to control the vibrations for these components. A Short Time Fourier Transform algorithm is used for semi-active control of the TMDs. The mathematical formulation of the integrated SFOWT-TMDs system is derived by using Euler-Lagrangian equations. The theoretical model derived is a time-varying system considering the aerodynamic properties of the blade, variable mass and stiffness per unit length, gravity, the interactions among the blades, nacelle, spar, mooring system and the TMDs, the hydrodynamic effects, the restoring moment and the buoyancy force. The aerodynamic loads on the nacelle and the spar due to their coupling with the blades are also considered. The effectiveness of the semi-active TMDs is investigated in the numerical examples where the mooring cable tension, rotor speed and the blade stiffness are varying over time. Except for excessively large strokes of the nacelle TMD, the semi-active algorithm is considerably more effective than the passive one in all cases and its effectiveness is restricted by the low-frequency nature of the nacelle and the spar responses."

ORR 효율성 평가를 용이하게 하는 지표(descriptor)로서 촉매 표면에서의 산소원자 흡착강도를 활용하는데, 산소흡착강도는 촉매 표면의 기하학적 구조 변형에 따른 전자구조를 변형함으로써 조절할 수 있다. 이에 본 연구에서는 백금 표면의 원자모델을 이용하여 표면의 기하학적 구조가 산소흡착 강도에 미치는 영향과 그 원인을 밀도범함수이론(density functional theory, DFT) 계산을 통해 분석하였다. 먼저, 기하학적 구조를 인위적으로 변형시킨 Pt(111) 표면에서의 산소흡착반응을 밀도범함수이론 계산을 이용해 분석함으로써 기하학적 구조 변화가 산소흡착강도에 미치는 영향(strain effect)을 확인하였다. 최적화한 Pt 격자상수(3.977 Å)에 ±1% 간격의 변화율을 적용하고 각 변화율마다의 산소흡착강도를 계산하였는데, Pt-Pt 원자 간 거리가 멀어질수록 산소흡착강도가 강해지는 것을 확인하였다. 이는 원자 간 거리가 증가할수록 d-band center가 페르미 준위(Fermi level)쪽으로 이동하게 되며, 이로써 일부 반결합 오비탈(anti-bonding orbitals)에 전자가 채워지지 않기 때문에 전체적으로 반결합 오비탈이 형성될 가능성이 적어지기 때문이다. 결과적으로, 순수한 백금이 가진 격자상수(3.9771 Å) 보다 약 2~4% 작은 백금 표면 격자크기를 가질 수 있도록 유도할 수 있다면 산소흡착강도가 적절히 약하게 조절될 수 있으며, 이는 순수한 백금보다 더 향상된 ORR 성능을 가진 촉매물질 개발 연구를 위한 기초자료로서 활용할 수 있을 것이다.","The overall reaction rate of fuel cell is governed by oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the cathode due to its slowest reaction compared to the oxidation of hydrogen in the anode. The ORR efficiency can be readily evaluated by examining the adsorption strength of atomic oxygen on the surface of catalysts (i.e., known as a descriptor) and the adsorption energy can be controlled by transforming the surface geometry of catalysts. In the current study, the effect of the surface geometry of catalysts (i.e., strain effect) on the adsorption strength of atomic oxygen on platinum catalysts was analyzed by using density functional theory (DFT). The optimized lattice constant of Pt (3.977 Å) was increased and decreased by 1% to apply tensile and compressive strain to the Pt surface. Then the oxygen adsorption strengths on the modified Pt surfaces were compared and the electron charge density of the O-adsorbed Pt surfaces was analyzed. As the interatomic distance increased, the oxygen adsorption strength became stronger and the d-band center of the Pt surface atoms was shifted toward the Fermi level, implying that anti-bonding orbitals were shifted to the conduction band from the valence band (i.e., the anti-bonding between O and Pt was less likely formed). Consequently, enhanced ORR efficiency may be expected if the surface Pt-Pt distance can be reduced by approximately 2~4% compared to the pure Pt owing to the moderately controlled oxygen binding strength for improved ORR."

This study investigates the use of clamshells as a natural calcium resource. Highly soluble powdered calcium lactate (LCCL) was prepared from the calcined powdered shells of littleneck clams (LCCP) using response surface methodology (RSM) to predict optimum conditions. These conditions, as derived from pH, solubility, and yield of 11 LCCLs manufactured according to the RSM model, were 1.80 M lactic acid and 1.13 M LCCP. The actual values of pH (6.98), solubility (93.99%), and yield (351.23%) under the optimized conditions were as predicted. The derived LCCL exhibited a strong buffering capacity in the range of pH 2.78-3.90 when combined with less than 2 mL of 1 N HCl. The ranges of calcium content and solubility of LCCL were 7.7-17.5 g/100 g and 96.6-98.9%, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of the LCCL identified it as calcium lactate pentahydrate, and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed an irregular and rod-like microstructure. These results confirm the potential use of clamshells, converted to highly soluble organic acid calcium, as an additive to enhance calcium content in food ingredients."

The analysis is conducted through a direct linkage between electromagnetic analysis and structural analysis. The analysis process is repeated until the electric current is completely discharged by a formed coil. We calculate the forming force that affects the workpiece using MAXWELL, a commercial electromagnetic finite element analysis program. Then, we simulate plastic behavior by using the calculated forming force data as the forming force input to ANSYS, a commercial structure finite element analysis program. We calculate the forming force data by using the model shape in MAXWELL, a commercial electromagnetic finite element analysis program. We repeat the process until the current is fully discharged by the formed coil. Our results can be used to reduce the error in data transformation with a reduced number of data transformations, because the proposed approach directly links the electromagnetic analysis and the structural analysis after removing the step of the numerical analysis of a graph describing the forming force, unlike the existing electromagnetic forming process. Second, it is possible to simulate a more realistic forming force by keeping a certain distance between nodes using the re-mesh function during the repeated analysis until the current is completely discharged by the formed coil, based on the MAXWELL results. We compare and review the results of the EFPA using the peak value of the forming force that acts on the workpiece (which is the existing analysis method), and the proposed phased EFPA over time approach."
Estudio sobre el caracter de egloga en La Galatea de Cervantes,2016,"['the eclogue', 'La Galatea', 'pastoral novels', '목가시', '갈라테아', '목가소설']",,"In the “Prologue” of La Galatea, Cervantes classifies the style of the work not as a plot-oriented novel but rather as an eclogue. Therefore, it is very important to analyze the characteristic of an eclogue that Cervantes identifies as his work`s genre. Cervantes esteemed writing poetry as a primary type of creative activity. Hence, he wished to write his work in the form of a poem, especially an eclogue which had a wide range of contemporaneous readership. The eclogue was a part of the typical classical genre, and it had a flexibility to incorporate other genres including prose. Many remarkable writers chose and wrote this genre as a part of their literary canon. Among these writers, Cervantes mainly modeled himself after Garcilaso de la Vega who had taken the Italian Renaissance poetry and transformed it into his own unique style. However, because of his lack of poetic talent, Cervantes could not write an authentic eclogue like the works of Garcilaso. Cervantes was a novelist, not a poet. As such, his genius as a novelist is amply displayed in his first novel. Betrayal, hatred, murder, et cetera: these negative elements that were hitherto not permitted in traditional pastoral novels add strong realism to Cervantes`s work. Hence La Galatea possesses dualism. The poetic part delivers the morals and the philosophical messages that the author wanted to impart. The prose, with its characteristic realism, brings amusement, vitality, and reality to those messages."

To reduce the number of questions in a questionnaire, we propose the balanced incomplete block mixed level design with minimum aberration which is generated by implementing proc factex in SAS. Also, we propose using two or three level BIB factorial design instead of mixed level designs by transforming three level attributes into two attributes of two levels and two level attribute into three level attribute by using dummy level technique. Results: We propose three methods for designing survey questionnaire where the block and design generators are found with practical number of questions in a questionnaire. By analyzing all the respondents survey data generated by the simulation study, we find the proper model and do the concepts optimization.

North Korea is sticking to a unique socialist system, but has been internationally isolated because it is pursuing a nuclear-economy as an advance policy. There is an enormous gap between South and North Korea in their respective international competitive power and status. For analysis on the possibility of a North Korean transition to a market economy and its limitations, when a clear approach to the phenomena in the socialist system of North Korea and correlation theory are combined, actual results can be obtained. With respect to past transition models to market economies by socialist countries, Russia, China, and Vietnam are important representative countries which transformed from a planned economies to market economies. As for the possibility of a similar transition in North Korea, because of the UN`s continued restraints against North Korea and the worsening international isolation, the initial signs of a market economy are appearing bit by bit in the border areas between North Korea and China and between North Korea and Russia. The city of Pyeongyang is considered a city with better development, and the planned economy led by the government is getting weaker in important local cities because of activated markets and the initial signs of a market economy are increasing. However, limitations of the transition of the North Korean system into a market economy include lack of certainty and confidence by political elites, their experience, international exchange, and the nuclear-economy in parallel with the advance policy, which will require a long time to overcome. For a successful transition to a market economic system, the North Korean government should be aware of the necessity of improvement in related market institutions."

In discharging, the input side(battery) voltage is 250V at least and this is boosted by 680V to transform 3-phase (380V/60Hz). In charging, the input side(3-phase) voltage is transformed into constant voltage(680V) and this is converted into battery voltage and charged. The battery was been using the lead storage battery. But, the battery uses the super capacitor to achieve high performance in paper. The inverter controller is made possible to optimize performance by using a double loop control system using a current controller and the voltage controller. The current controller is designed to enable the control of the error by selecting the dead-bit control method to have the most rapid response characteristic for a sampling time is reached to zero and the control voltage were selected to design approach has the under damping. Through mathematical modeling it demonstrated that the controller has reached the error to zero in exactly one sampling. Using the MATLAB computer simulation of the same design and physical model demonstrated the superiority of the responsiveness of the control system."
Usability of inclinometers as a complementary measurement tool in structural monitoring,2016,"['structural health monitoring', 'GPS', 'inclinometers', 'time series', 'measurement']",,"In the last few years, many structural monitoring studies have been performed using different techniques to measure structures of different scales such as buildings, dams or bridges. One of the mostly used tools are GPS instruments, which have been utilized in various combinations with accelerometers and some other conventional sensors. In the current study, observation series were recorded for 8 hours with GPS receivers (NovAtel) and Inclination Measurement Sensors mounted on a television tower in Istanbul, Turkey. Each series of observations collected from two different sensors were transformed into a single coordinate system (Local Topocentric Coordinates System). The positional changes of the tower were calculated from the GPS and the inclination data. These changes were plotted in two dimensions (2D) on the same graphic. Thus, the possibility of comparison and analysis were found using the data from both the GPS and the Inclinometer complement each other, in the real test area. The positional changes of the tower were modeled for further examination. As a result, the movement of the tower within an area of 1×1 cm2 was observed. Based on the results, it can be concluded that inclinometers can be used for monitoring the structural behavior of the tower."

In order to solve this problem, it proposed that Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) should be responsible for the commissioning process at a local level. Following the consultation process, from October 2014 PCCs become responsible for the commissioning of victim services. As a result of the PCCs’ responsibilities for the commissiong of victims’ services, a number of different models have subsequently been developed across England and Wales. In 2013, Victims’Code was also revised to transform the criminal justice system by putting victims first, making the system more responsive and easier to navigate. It sets a minimum standard for the services that must be provided to victims of crime by organisation in England and Wales. These reformed victim policies in England and Wales can be important references in the preparation of establishing a new action plan for protection and support for victims in Korea."
A Method of Analyzing ECG to Diagnose Heart Abnormality utilizing SVM and DWT,2016,"['ECG', 'DWT', 'SVM']",,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal gives a clear indication whether the heart is at a healthy status or not as the early notification of a cardiac problem in the heart could save the patient's life. Several methods were launched to clarify how to diagnose the abnormality over the ECG signal waves. However, some of them face the problem of lack of accuracy at diagnosis phase of their work. In this research, we present an accurate and successive method for the diagnosis of abnormality through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), QRS complex detection and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification with overall accuracy rate 95.26%. DWT Refers to sampling any kind of discrete wavelet transform, while SVM is known as a model with related learning algorithm, which is based on supervised learning that perform regression analysis and classification over the data sample. We have tested the ECG signals for 10 patients from different file formats collected from PhysioNet database to observe accuracy level for each patient who needs ECG data to be processed. The results will be presented, in terms of accuracy that ranged from 92.1% to 97.6% and diagnosis status that is classified as either normal or abnormal factors."

Specifically, it analyzes the shifts in North Korea`s SEZ policy in three different aspects-North Korea`s unique territorial logic, stress on decentralization, and comparison with Chinese reform and opening-up. Based upon this analysis, this paper criticizes a linear approach to understand North Korea`s economic transformation from isolation to opening-up, and explores the dynamics of North Korea SEZ strategy in various dimensions. It contends that North Korea`s SEZ strategy is neither an inevitable choice from economic difficulty nor an adoption of Chinese model of reform and opening up. Rather this paper focuses on the geopolitical logic and local development imperatives underlying SEZ strategy."
Taint Inference for Cross-Site Scripting in Context of URL Rewriting and HTML Sanitization,2016,"['Taint inference', 'cross-site scripting', 'URL rewriting', 'HTML sanitization', 'bioinformatics']",,"Currently, web applications are gaining in prevalence. In a web application, an input may not be appropriately validated, making the web application susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS), which poses serious security problems for Internet users and websites to whom such trusted web pages belong. A taint inference is a type of information flow analysis technique that is useful in detecting XSS on the client side. However, in existing techniques, two current practical issues have yet to be handled properly. One is URL rewriting, which transforms a standard URL into a clearer and more manageable form. Another is HTML sanitization, which filters an input against blacklists or whitelists of HTML tags or attributes. In this paper, we make an analogy between the taint inference problem and the molecule sequence alignment problem in bioinformatics, and transfer two techniques related to the latter over to the former to solve the aforementioned yet-to-be-handled-properly practical issues. In particular, in our method, URL rewriting is addressed using local sequence alignment and HTML sanitization is modeled by introducing a removal gap penalty. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method."
Concurrency Control Method to Provide Transactional Processing for Cloud Data Management System,2016,"['Transaction', 'Cloud Data Management', 'Snapshot Isolation']",,"As new applications of cloud data management system (CDMS) such as online games, cooperation edit, social network, and so on, are increasing, transaction processing capabilities for CDMS are required. Several transaction processing methods for cloud data management system (CDMS) have been proposed. However, existing transaction processing methods have some problems. Some of them provide limited transaction processing capabilities. Some of them are hard to be integrated with existing CDMSs. In this paper, we proposed a new concurrency control method to support transaction processing capability for CDMS to solve these problems. The proposed method was designed and implemented based on Spark, an in-memory distributed processing framework. It uses RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) model to provide fault tolerant to data in the main memory. In our proposed method, database stored in CDMS is loaded to main memory managed by Spark. The loaded data set is then transformed to RDD. In addition, we proposed a multi-version concurrency control method through immutable characteristics of RDD. Finally, we performed experiments to show the feasibility of the proposed method."

Unlike capitalist welfare aiming at correcting market results socialist welfare has been proposed to satisfy people’s basic needs, but it had operated as instrument of dictatorship. Relation between welfare and dictatorship could be distinguished as hard exchange and soft one in line with social construction of welfare. Welfare-dictatorship relation in East Germany had developed from its formation(1949-1970s), crisis(1980s) and dissolution(1989-1990). There had established hard exchange relation in which the legitimacy of dominance had debted to welfare as social rights. While crisis of the exchange relation had been modest in a form of insufficient supply of consumption goods, it was one of the elements of collapse of dictatorship, leading to the unification with West Germany. The journey of the exchange relation in North Korea can be characterized by its formation(1948-1980), crisis(1990s-2000s), and transformation(2010s). Unlike East Germany, welfare was socially constructed as gift form the ruler to the ruled, which made the combination of welfare and dictatorship loosely coupled. Although economic crisis was severe compared to East German one the rulers have succeeded maintaining dictatorial dominance by creating dual exchange relation. They separated core group and subordinated one supporting the former at the expense of the latter. They blocked out most of the people from soft exchange relation making bad use of muddling-through life style dependent on market activities. This strategy led to a ’dictatorship neutral welfare extinction’. Taking the high degree of institutionalization of newly establishing welfare-dictatorship relation into account, lives of most people are hardly expected to be improved by gift by their rulers even if North Korean economy will recover in the future."

An integrative review of recent research is conducted in the following ways, focusing on service quality and customer satisfaction.  First, this study examines recent developments in the conceptualization and measurement of service quality and customer satisfaction and probes the theoretical frameworks. Although SERVQUAL and SERVPERF are two representative models for measuring service quality, KS-SQI (Korean-standard Service Quality Model) has been developed and reliably used as a unique and representative model in Korea. On the other hand, KSCI and NCSI are popular models for measuring customer satisfaction in Korea.  Second, the study investigates the effects of service quality and customer satisfaction on firm performance and discusses their effectiveness. Many studies have shown that customer satisfaction has significant effects on the profitability and value of firms. Empirical results also reveal that customer satisfaction has a dynamic effect on firm performance in terms of carryover effects over time.  Third, after scrutinizing the definitions and types of customer loyalty as well as the determinants of customer-oriented loyalty programs, this study suggests practical implications for managers. Specifically, researchers have made a conceptual distinction between true loyalty and spurious loyalty, and studies show that two types of loyalty yield different consequences. Several studies have also investigated how to design loyalty programs in order to attain customer loyalty.   Finally, future research directions are discussed by integrating theoretical developments and emerging research trends. It is suggested that more attention should be paid to customer dysfunctional behavior, side effects of reward programs, transformative service, technological advances, and customer affect."

The results show Taiwan, which began modernizing earlier, to exhibit more egalitarian gender attitudes than China in the domains of education, political leadership, and economic leadership. However, the mainland Chinese are more likely than the Taiwanese to approve of women working for pay, and less likely to feel that women should adopt a solely domestic role, whereas the Taiwanese are more likely than the Chinese to approve of women both working outside the home and staying at home. The results of a multinomial logit model demonstrate the gap in gender-role attitudes on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to be most pronounced in the oldest cohorts. The differing trajectories of the socioeconomic transformation in the two societies explain the differences in their gender-role attitudes."

Through the analysis, it becomes clear that there are two significant features. First, the trend of regional policy has been changed from Government led plan such as industrial development and infrastructure improvement to Local autonomy focusing on regional power revitalization. Second, policy evaluation, sharing efficient models and partnership with local NPO and volunteers have promoted to enact new regional policy in this period. Especially under the rule of Koizumi Junichiro, these transformations of regional policies were accelerated. This analysis reveals the context why the thought of regional independence spread so quickly and suggests that the relationship between central government and local government has been changed structurally in this period."
Estudio sobre el carácter de égloga en La Galatea de Cervantes,2016,"['the eclogue', 'La Galatea', 'pastoral novels', '목가시', '갈라테아', '목가소설']",,"In the “Prologue” of La Galatea, Cervantes classifies the style of the work not as a plot-oriented novel but rather as an eclogue. Therefore, it is very important to analyze the characteristic of an eclogue that Cervantes identifies as his work’s genre. Cervantes esteemed writing poetry as a primary type of creative activity. Hence, he wished to write his work in the form of a poem, especially an eclogue which had a wide range of contemporaneous readership. The eclogue was a part of the typical classical genre, and it had a flexibility to incorporate other genres including prose. Many remarkable writers chose and wrote this genre as a part of their literary canon. Among these writers, Cervantes mainly modeled himself after Garcilaso de la Vega who had taken the Italian Renaissance poetry and transformed it into his own unique style. However, because of his lack of poetic talent, Cervantes could not write an authentic eclogue like the works of Garcilaso. Cervantes was a novelist, not a poet. As such, his genius as a novelist is amply displayed in his first novel. Betrayal, hatred, murder, et cetera: these negative elements that were hitherto not permitted in traditional pastoral novels add strong realism to Cervantes’s work. Hence La Galatea possesses dualism. The poetic part delivers the morals and the philosophical messages that the author wanted to impart. The prose, with its characteristic realism, brings amusement, vitality, and reality to those messages."

A variety of Wilber’s writings and studies on gender conducted by the Integral Community were reviewed. The literature review centers on Wilber’s perspective on feminism, the consciousness of sex and gender, typology of ego development. Integral feminism expands women’s experiences and gender identities to transpersonal development beyond pre-personal and personal aspects. The author developed an integral map on gender and feminism using an all quadrant all level (AQAL) model of integral feminism. The integral theory explains gender in the context of the consciousness development of humankind and individuals. From this perspective, gender and gender identities, which have been constructed in modern society is expected to be transcended as society evolves into a post-modernism phase. Individuals are expected to have transpersonal consciousness of gender accompanied by de-identifying with all traits along with psychological and spiritual development. Gender typology requires sensitive insights into a process and influences of forming differences as it has political implications and influence on individual development, which is different from other typologies. In order for integral feminism to offer a more detailed map and clinical implications, it needs to incorporate a perspective from feminist counseling that addresses women’s issues based on cultural, social, and political contexts, focusing on gender and power. Feminist epistemology and feminist counseling techniques, such as a gender analysis and a power analysis, are beneficial to understand the close relationships among four quadrants. The spectrum theory that includes transpersonal aspects of human consciousness development and the integral theory that emphasizes the transformation of social systems along with individual psychology for consciousness development would benefit to found transpersonal feminist counseling."
Medical Internet of Things and Big Data in Healthcare,2016,"['Telemedicine', 'Smartphone', 'Mobile Applications', 'Wireless Technology', 'Disease Management']",,"Objectives: A number of technologies can reduce overall costs for the prevention or management of chronic illnesses. These include devices that constantly monitor health indicators, devices that auto-administer therapies, or devices that track realtime health data when a patient self-administers a therapy. Because they have increased access to high-speed Internet and smartphones, many patients have started to use mobile applications (apps) to manage various health needs. These devices and mobile apps are now increasingly used and integrated with telemedicine and telehealth via the medical Internet of Things (mIoT). This paper reviews mIoT and big data in healthcare fields. Methods: mIoT is a critical piece of the digital transformation of healthcare, as it allows new business models to emerge and enables changes in work processes, productivity improvements, cost containment and enhanced customer experiences. Results: Wearables and mobile apps today support fitness, health education, symptom tracking, and collaborative disease management and care coordination. All those platform analytics can raise the relevancy of data interpretations, reducing the amount of time that end users spend piecing together data outputs. Insights gained from big data analysis will drive the digital disruption of the healthcare world, business processes and real-time decision-making. Conclusions: A new category of “personalised preventative health coaches” (Digital Health Advisors) will emerge. These workers will possess the skills and the ability to interpret and understand health and well-being data. They will help their clients avoid chronic and diet-related illness, improve cognitive function, achieve improved mental health and achieve improved lifestyles overall. As the global population ages, such roles will become increasingly important."

대처주의(Thatcherism) 정책과 유산,2016,"['대처주의', '케인스식 사회민주주의적 합의', '자유 시장', '강한 국가', '자조', 'Thatcherism', 'Keynesian Social Democratic Consensus', 'Free Market', 'Strong State', 'Self-Help']","대처주의는 영국이 ‘영국병’으로 신음하던 때에 태동하여 경제 영역에선 통화주의에 기초한 자유방임적 자유 시장 정책을 단행했다. 반면, 비경제 영역에선 강력한 국가를 동원하여 이런 자유로운 시장과 보다 역동적인 사회의 건설에 우호적인 문화적환경을 조성하려 했다. 이로써 대처주의는 영국 경제의 부활의 발판을 마련했으며 강력한 군사·외교 정책과 더불어 국가적·민족적 자긍심을 강화했다. 동시에 노동당이 실용적인 중도 좌파 정당으로 탈바꿈하는 데도 크게 기여했다. 그러나 이런 개혁을가능케 했던 대처의 강력한 개인적 리더십은 임기 말로 갈수록 제왕적·권위적으로 변해갔으며, 경제적 및 지역적 불평등이 심화된 가혹하고 분열된 사회라는 부정적 결과를 낳기도 해서, 성장과 분배를 함께 추진할 수 있는 모델의 모색이라는 과제를남겨 놓았다. 이런 양면성의 유산 때문에 대처와 대처주의에 대한 평가는 극명하게엇갈릴 수밖에 없다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 2008년 국제 금융위기가 닥치기 이전까지 대처주의와 신자유주의는 시대의 흐름을 주도하면서 국내외적으로 많은 사람들의 삶과 사회의 구조와 작동 방식을 변화시켰다는 점 등은 부인하기 어렵다. 이런 점들을 고려한다면, 대처는 보기 드문 리더십을 통해 역사의 흐름을 바꿔놓은 ‘진정한 정치인’이라고 평가하는 것도 무리는 아닐 것이다. 현재 ‘영국병’과 유사한 ‘한국병’을 앓고 있는 우리에게는 대처주의 유산을 깊이 성찰할 때이며, ‘진정한 정치인’과 탁월한 리더십의 출현을 기대해본다.","Thatcherism, gaining forces when Britain suffered from the ‘British Disease’, adopted a series of policies intended for a free market. It also tried to establish a cultural environment which would work in a way favorable to the free economy and a more dynamic society. Leading the contemporary world until the outbreak of the 2008 financial crisis, Thatcherism (together with neo-liberalism) secured for British economy a foothold to revive and helped British people recover national pride and confidence. It also helped Labour transform itself towards a sound pragmatic center-left party in British politics seeking for ‘social-ism.’ On the other hand, Thatcherism brought about a harsh and divisive society in which the level of both economic and regional inequalities was exacerbated. Even with such dual aspects of Thatcherist legacies, Thatcher and Thatcherism transformed not only the structure of British society and British people’s life but also the way of their working. In short, the ‘statesman’ Thatcher has changed a stream of history. Likewise, Thatcherism serves as model for Korean people who are now suffering from a ‘Korean Disease’ similar to the ‘British Disease’ of the 1970s."

The Image of Saimdang had undergone the transformation three times for about forty years from 1905 to 1945. Firstly, She was called the ‘educated woman’ who well trained her children at home as Lee, Yulgok’s mother in order to argue the necessity of education of women. Secondly, Saimdang encountered the discourses on ‘a wise mother and good wife’ and was invented as a traditional and ideal woman, that is a wise mother and good wife in 1930s. There were historical contexts regarding the critiques of western modernity, nostalgic moods of past, and disgust of so-called ‘new woman’. Lastly, She was spent as the symbol of ‘militaristic mother’ and ‘woman in the rear ground’(銃後婦人). It was naturally colonialistic appropriation which stems from national demanding of women. These discoursive representations of Shin, Saimdang were connected with political context at that time and Those were the politics reinforcing gender roles. In short, the images of Shin, Saimdang were reconstructed according to national or colonialist demanding. Futhermore, Shin, Saimdang dicourses together with ‘new women’ discourses have reinforced gender identities in colonial Korea. In particular, the discourses on ‘new women’ continued to ‘après-girl’ or ‘Madame Freedom’ dicourses in 1950s and ‘Doenjang girls’[soy bean paste girls] dicourses in contemporary days."

Also, if his logic of philosophy is derived and shown by symbolizing his thought model, difficult themes of Neo-Confucianism would be more understandable. In addition, if his plan for northern expedition is playacted, this will greatly arouse an echo. It is because a play created an impression more than any other genre.

혈청 대사체와 뇌졸중 발생위험의 용량반응 분석,2016,"['Cohort study', 'Dose-response', 'Metabolites', 'Stroke']",,"Objectives: Except the known risk factors for stroke, few studies have identified novel metabolic markers that could effectively detect stroke at an early stage. In this study, we explored the dose-response relationship between serum metabolites and the incidence of stroke. Methods: We studied 213 adults in the Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II (KCPS-II) biobank and estimated dose-response relationship between serum metabolites and stroke (42 cases and 171 controls). Three serum metabolites (Acetylcholine, HexadecylAcetylGlycerol, and 1-acetyl-2-formyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) were used in this study. The analysis included (1) exploratory nonlinear analysis, (2) estimation of flexion points and slopes at below and above the points. In the model to estimate risk of incidence of stroke, we controlled for conventional risk factors such as age, sex, systolic blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, tri-glyceride, and smoking status. Results: The relationship between incidence of stroke and log-transformed 1-acetyl-2-formyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocho-line was non-linear with flexion point around intensity score of 8.8, whereas other metabolites, log-transformed Acetylcholine and HexadecylAcetylGlyc-erol, showed negative linear patterns. Conclusions: The study suggests that metabolic markers are associated with incidence of stroke, particularly, at or above the flexion point. The study result may contribute to developing a novel system for precise stroke prediction."

It is necessary because the Christian universities should find a way to cope with the university restructuring strongly driven by the government and strengthen educational competitiveness. The evangelical personality education can realize a distinctive and excellent Christian education, which should foster the spirituality incarnating the kingdom of God. The incarnational spirituality education aims at a holistic, integrated education, not restricted to a cognitive learning, but leading to a comprehensive learning - knowing, sharing, and practicing the values of the Gospel while cultivating religious personality and moral character. Nurturing the spirituality purposes to establish a right relationship with God to develop self-esteem, community values, and responsibility for neighbor, society, nature, and the world. It is the incarnational spirituality education to infiltrate the values of the Gospel such as truth, love, and service into the whole personality. It will transform the whole person to forge links with neighbor, local community, and glocal society and help to realize on earth the core value of the kingdom of God, that is, shalom encompassing justice, peace, and love. The incarnational spirituality education can be argued on the theological bases supported by H. Richard Niebuhr’s model of the Gospel transforming culture, Johannes F. Hoekendijk’s idea of missio dei, Theo Sundermeier’s missiological concept of Konvivenz, Thomas H. Groome’s educational theory of conation, and William A. Linton’s ideal of the Christian university. This paper suggests how to practice the incarnational spirituality education, presenting cases and examples of the Christian universities in Korea. The incarnational spirituality education should include first, culture-transforming education correlating faith with learning; secondly, holistic, practical education enabling the whole personality to know, share, practice the values of the Gospel; thirdly, communal and glocal education transcending the self to participate in community and facilitate the realization of shalom in the glocal society; finally but not least, mutual relational education between professors and students through personal meeting and communal life sharing. The success of the alternative evangelical education will rely on the best use of curricular courses, extra-curricular activities, and efficient educational systems that the Christian university will make."
見佛-인도아대륙의 초기 불교 造像,2016,"['초기 불교 미술', '불교 서사 조각', '간다라 조각', '바르후트 스투파', 'early Buddhist art', 'Buddhist narrative sculpture', 'Gandharan sculpture', 'Bharhut stupa']","본고는 인도아대륙의 초기 불교미술을 중심으로, 부처와 부처의 가르침이 불교도들 사이에서 어떻게 시각적 형식을 갖추기 시작했는지를 고찰하는 새로운 방식을 제안하고자 한다.   인간의 모습을 한 불상이 아직 나오기 전, 기원전 2세기 말~1세기 초에 조성된 바르후트(Bharhut) 스투파의 울타리에 표현된 초기 불교 서사를 면밀히 재검토한 결과, 당시의 부처는 불교도가 섬겨야 할 인간상으로서보다는 위대하게 顯現한 경의를 표해야 할 존재로 인식되었다. 바르후트에서는 부처가 역사적으로 무엇을 했는지를 크게 관심 있게 다루지 않았던 것으로 보인다. 부처의 일생에서 선택된 사건이 제한적이고 서사의 내용 또한 구체적이지 않기 때문에, 정확하고 순차적이며 역사적인 석가모니의 佛傳은 아직 성문화되지 않았음을 알 수 있다. 기원전 1세기경에 조성된 산치(Sanchi) 스투파의 문 조각들을 보면 불교도들은 석가모니의 형상을 다른 방식으로 이해하기 시작했던 것으로 보인다. 부처는 예불 장면이나 신체에 대한 상징적 암시를 통해서뿐만 아니라, 실제 행적에 대한 묘사를 통해 존재를 구체적으로 드러내게 되었다.  쿠샨 시대(기원후 1~3세기) 간다라 북서부의 서사 미술은 실체적 부처의 행적을 중심으로 그의 전반적인 삶을 묘사하는 데 강한 관심을 드러낸다. 이 시기에 부처는 인간의 모습으로 재현되기 시작했고, 부처의 일생은 단순히 행적을 열거하는 것이 아닌 종교적 일대기가 되었다. 간다라의 서사 부조에서 삶의 일시성과 신화의 보편성은 한데 엮여 모든 사람이 따를 수 있는 하나의 모델이 되었다. 소형 스투파에는 불전 장면들이 묘사되고 그 둘레를 도는 불교도들이 이를 연대기 순으로 볼 수 있었다. 간다라 지역에서 나타나는 부처의 생애에 대한 개념적 변화는 그 서사를 극으로 각색할 때 나타날 수 있는 변화와 비슷한 것이며, 부처의 극적인 사건들은 이러한 예술적 전개에 일련의 역할을 했을 가능성이 있다. 서사를 강조하는 것은 북인도 마투라 지역의 당대 불교미술과는 무관한 것으로 보인다. 부처를 재현한 삼차원 조각들은 광대한 쿠샨의 영토 전역에서 제작되었으나, 마투라 지역 불상에서는 부처의 몸에 대해 조금 다른 관점과 처리 방식을 보인다. 우리가 불상과 실제 사리 간의 긴밀한 관계를 발견하게 되는 것은 바로 간다라에서이다.","This article focuses on early Buddhist art from the Indian Subcontinent and proposes new ways to look at how the Buddha and his message began to take visual form among his followers.A thorough re-examination of the early Buddhist narratives represented on the enclosure of the Bharhut stupa dating from the end of the 2nd and the beginning of the 1st century BCE, when an anthropomorphic image of the Buddha had not yet been developed, suggests that the Buddha was not yet conceived of as the human example to follow, but rather as a presence to honor in his prodigious manifestations. Tracing the Buddha’s historic actions seems to not have been a concern at Bharhut; the limited choice of life events and their lack of narrative specificity suggest that a rigorous, sequential and historical life story of Shakyamuni was yet to be codified. From the sculpture decorating the gates of the Sanchi stupa dating to the 1stcentury BCE ca., it appears that worshippers began to relate in different ways to the figure of Shakyamuni; his presence was made tangible not only through images of devotion and symbolic allusion to his physical body but also through depictions of his actual actions.In the narrative art of the northwestern region of Gandhara during the Kushan period (1st-3rd CE) emerges a strong interest in depicting a cohesive life centered on the actions of the physical Buddha. The Buddha at this time started to be represented in human form, and his life became a spiritual biography and not a simple succession of actions. In Gandharan narratives, the temporality of life and the universality of myth were always intertwined to become a viable model for all to follow. The life scenes were depicted on small stupas and were viewed by devotees in chronological order as they walked around such monuments. The conceptual transformation that the life of the Buddha underwent in this region is comparable to the one that would take place in a dramatic adaptation of the narration, and it is possible that Buddhist drama may have played a role in these artistic developments.  The narrative emphasis appears irrelevant in the contemporary Buddhist art from the Mathura region in North India.  Three-dimensional sculptures representing the Buddha are made throughout the vast Kushan territory, however, the images from Mathura seem also to betray slightly different treatments and views of the Buddha’s body; it is especially in Gandhara that we notice a strong link between Buddhist icons and actual Buddhist relics."

Synthesis and Characterization of an ELP-conjugated Liposome with Thermo-sensitivity for Controlled Release of a Drug,2016,"['drug delivery system (DDS)', 'elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)', 'liposome', 'thermo-sensitive drug carrier']",,"Liposome, one of various drug carriers, has been extensively studied as an inert carrier for the delivery of protein, DNA, and biologically active agents into cells. Recently, much effort has been directed to the development of stimuli-sensitive liposomes that are able to respond to certain internal or external stimuli, such as, pH, electricity, temperature, magnet, or light. Among them, to obtain liposomes which release the contents in response to ambient temperature, liposomes have been modified with chemically synthetic polymers having various lower critical solution temperatures (LCST). In this study, instead of chemically synthetic polymers, a biologically produced elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), which was composed of oligomeric repeats of the pentapeptide sequence (Val-Pro-Gly-Val-Gly), was used for endowing the liposome with thermo-sensitivity. A model drug was encapsulated in the ELP-conjugated liposomes and the release behavior of the drug caused by the liposome disruption due to the aggregation of ELPs was investigated. In addition, conjugation of ELP to liposome was identified with Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analyses."

To maximize such efficiency, it should be integrated and managed in proper size and that way, we would be able to reinforce its competency. In addition, the marrow of the enhanced competency is applying creativity and convergence and various public institutions are recently working on it to fortify their competency. However, Korean government`s policy is more focusing on privatization than nationalization and the government has established Port Authority (PA). The function of PA aims to fostering autonomy of management, autonomy, entrepreneurship, professionalism, small government policy, cost-effectiveness, and overall efficiency Numerous harbors around the world have been enlarged and globalized. Naturally, many opinions on PA have been growing and they are mainly about integration of PA once again. In addition, many ideas are now focusing on how to integrate and what procedures will be applied. In details, there are some perspectives whether the integration is surely appropriate, urgent, beneficial, and inevitable especially since competition of harbors in the North-East region has been fierce and there will be more harbors in the near future and the business model of the region is mainly based on direct lines for large vessels. Moreover, the nations in the region are fostering logistics hub ports Due to FTA, countries in North-East region are changing their industrial locations in order to deal with non-tariff barriers. Consequently, there have been changes on logistics networks and it requires PA focusing on building sustainable capability for efficient management. Integration of PA features a great chance of expanding its markets internationally This paper is based on AHP approach to identify priority on merging PAs. The factors of evaluation are: economic feasibility, efficiency consistency, stability, and competency Outcome of the analysis shows competency is the crucial factor. Also, when it comes to proposal for PA integration, merging turns out to be the best solution and maintaining the current structure comes in second. In order to utilize PA, it requires distinctiveness of environment of harbors and shipping companies, unique system, enhanced international competency, and efficiency and suitability of management. First of all, Global Terminal Operator (GTO) pursues dualization of scale and diversification of business. Second, logistics market has been integrating in a great size so it requires PA to achieve the optimal solution: pushing through economy of scale and scope at the same time. Third, PA needs to set an evaluation standard on harbors based on long-term perspective, objectivity, validity, and fairness. To utilize PA, cooperation between foreign harbors is crucial and strategic partnership, fortifying its capability and complementary collaboration are required because PA features environmental and regional distinctiveness. Thus, enhancing its international capability via global cooperation and integration is required."

This article deeply examines Paul’s pedagogy and Spirituality in education assuming Paul as an educator. In order to understand the characteristics of Paul as an educator, first of all, it is necessary to take a look Paul’s educational background. Education that Paul received before and after his Damascus experience helped him to become a good educator in the Gentile world. Next topic that is going to be introduced is Paul’s pedagogy according to four elements: the meaning of ‘teaching’, the goal of education, pedagogical language, attitude as an educator.  Paul must have inherited and set his meaning of ‘teaching’ from the Old Testament and the Jewish tradition about education which emphasize that educators are the ones who do the work of God who is the educator of the Bible. Paul’s educational goal is “to announce Christ’s cross” and human personality transformation through their relation with Christ. The realization of the human vocation, that is Imago Dei, can be achieved by one’s effort to live in conformity to the Cross. Educational language that Paul used in his letters are divided into three levels: rhetoric-persuading dimension(exhortation and admonition), pastoral-functional dimension(paternity and maternity), testimony and transformation dimension(imitation).  On the basis of these three dimensions, by reviewing Pauline letters, examination of Paul’s attitude(style) as an educator within his communities follows. Paul exhorts them by God’s mercy, takes care of believers within communities as father and mother and becomes a model to imitate. Thus, reflection of several key elements of spirituality in education for modern educators in this age takes place in the end.  In sum, an educator is ‘a leading learner’ and educational goal has to be human personality transformation following that of Christ. As a commissioner of God, an educator must teach and create good space for learning. Educator must use persuading pedagogy in which logos, pathos and ethos are integrated. Through education, an educator must weave networks of relations between Christ, that is, the subject of teaching and learner and educator."

The subjects are Chinese students learning Korean, and the study examines the real effects that are documented. It should be noted through cognitive processes that the education model for mutual learning of vocabulary construction assumes vocabulary bonding in structuralism. Further, it is organically combined with transformational grammar, whose recognition is important to this research. The structural combination of vocabulary is applied to the syntagmatic relation of construction. Furthermore, transformational grammar is applied to sentence structure, which covers the use of predicates. Both structural and transformational methods are organically combined and expressed through the choice of the appropriate predicate. In a cognitive process, the required aspect structure is combined with the speaker's purpose. The cognitive process of making a sentence enables learners to study both vocabulary and construction in accordance with their ability, which is represented by their status (phase)."
구면 스레피안 함수로 표현된 지각 자기이상값과 구배 성분,2016,['Swarm'],,"I presented three vector crustal magnetic anomaly components and six gradients by using spherical Slepian functions over the cap area of $20^{\circ}$ of radius centered on the South Pole. The Swarm mission, launched by European Space Agency(ESA) in November of 2013, was planned to put three satellites into the low-Earth orbits, two in parallel in East-West direction and one in cross-over of the higher altitude. This orbit configuration will make the gradient measurements possible in North-South direction, vertical direction, as well as E-W direction. The gravity satellites, such as GRACE and GOCE, have already implemented their gradient measurements for recovering the accurate gravity of the Earth and its temporal variation due to mass changes on the subsurface. However, the magnetic gradients have little been applied since Swarm launched. A localized magnetic modeling method is useful in taking an account for a region where data availability was limited or of interest was special. In particular, computation to get the localized solutions is much more efficient and it has an advantage of presenting high frequency anomaly features with numbers of solutions fewer than the global ones. Besides, these localized basis functions that were done by a linear transformation of the spherical harmonic functions, are orthogonal so that they can be used for power spectrum analysis by transforming the global spherical harmonic coefficients. I anticipate in scientific and technical progress in the localized modeling with the gradient measurements from Swarm and here will do discussion on the results of the localized solution to represent the three vector and six gradient anomalies over the Antarctic area from the synthetic data derived from a global solution of the spherical harmonics for the crustal magnetic anomalies of Swarm measurements."

The study on women leadership has started during 1980s and continued to develop its components. Overall the study concluded that women's leadership tends to be more democratic and more transformational than that of men. Inclusion of female in the leadership and decision-making process results in successful and effective performance in the management of various corporations and organizations.Then, the study had suggested six points to enhance the gender inclusive leadership; first, searching for potential women leaders among women pastors; second, allowing women leader to empower themselves and increasetheir leadership competence; third, overcoming female stereotype such as self-pity, low- self esteem, and passivity; fourth, developing role-model of women in leadership so that such stories can concretize and inspire other women; fifth, finding a way to solve reentry problems for the married women pastors, and finally, cooperating from male leaders in the churches."

Schaeffler attempts to interpret critically the achievements of Bloch’s subversive hermeneutics and to explore the possibility of laying the catholic theology of hope. Schaeffler points out Bloch’s ‘edit-historical Bible understanding,’ in which priests have faked Israelites religious traditions, as a problem. Instead, he suggests ‘religions-historical Bible understanding’ as an alternative, which emphasizes dialectical mediation of ‘promise’ and ‘accomplishments.’ Schaeffler also criticizes Bloch’s theory of extreme dichotomy as it exaggerates the extent to which ‘this world’ and the ‘coming world’ are in a conflict. He suggests dialectical identity of the two worlds as an ideal destination of Christian theology of hope. To that end, Schaeffler presents the difference between the Israelites’ religious point of view and that of the Persians. Bloch’s dualistic, atheistic Bible interpretation, according to Schaeffler’s argumentation, is not a result of manipulation by the priest, but of Bloch’s misunderstanding of religious-historical developmental processes from dualism to monotheism.  Through his criticism against Bloch, Schaeffler will re-transform the principle of Biblical hermeneutics to traditional Christian principles. Schaeffler argues that Persian requisites rooted in Jewish traditions flowed in at the end of Babylonian captivity era. However, the bond between Israelites and Persians dates back to the era of Abraham. Moreover, considering retroactively to the era of slavery in Egypt or the process of contacts before the Babylonian exile era, it is not sufficient for Schaeffler to unilaterally paralyze Bloch’s biblical interpretation. The dialectical thoughts of Kant, Bloch, and Schaeffler, which are the typical types of postulate think-method, aim to get rid of logical contradiction through inevitably asked apologetics and to find the condition in which such resolution may be possible. From this notion, we can realize that it is our important task to check the similarities and differences between Bloch’s philosophy of hope and Schaeffler’s Catholic theology of hope. While Bloch tries to interpret the Bible from an atheistic, Persian dualistic perspective, hereby establishing his philosophy of hope, Schaeffler attempts to re-formate it into theistic, monotheistic theology of hope."

In particular, the participation of wide stakeholders and their collaborative efforts through the ‘formation of collaborative governance’ have been emphasized as a key strategy to proceed with diverse community-building activities successfully. Given this significance of collaborative governance approach, this paper examines the Daesungdong Community Project in the city of Paju, especially focusing on how their community building governance has been structured and processed. The case study shows that in those special areas, the role of central and local government was very critical in initiating the community-building project. The national government took a role of network broker or civic enabler, which facilitated the effective mobilization of human and material resources within/beyond the community. In particular, the case demonstrates the transformation of the government-initiated community=building governance to a civic participatory model, where diverse actors in civil society and their collective intelligence made a meaningful contribution."

Firstly, Apel’s attempt to dissolve the question ‘Why be moral’ by a transcendental-pragmatic reflection is not successful, since it is not clear whether this kind of existential question can be answered by philosophical argument. Secondly, Apel’s argument that universally valid moral norms as indispensable preposition in communicative praxis can be discovered by transcendental-pragmatic reflection is flawed because it is based on a confustion of purposive-rational rules and moral norms. Moreover, Apel can answer the question ‘Why these presuppostions, not others?’ only by appealing to a kind of philosophilcal reflection which is not strict enough to vindicate a claim of necessary truth. Apel refutes Albert’s anti-foundatinalist argument is based on pragmatic contradiction by the concept of pragmatic contradiction. But since it is possible to transform Apel’s argument to one which is not based on the concept of pragmatic contradiction, it is not clear whether his position really overcomes Albert’s munchhausen trilemma. Thirdly, Apel’s claim that a unanimous rational agreement by participants of discource can construct and justify valid moral norms is flawed with unrealizability because it assimilates the model of communicative community aimed at reflection on practical problems to scientist community reflecting on truth claim. These critical assessments can give, if valid, a reason to reconsider the foundationalist project based on the logic of transcendental pragmatics."

His minimalist, drybrush style, featuring angular rocks and sparsely foliaged trees, is iconic in the history of Chinese painting, which impacted later painters. Ni established a composition of tall trees, rocks, and an empty pavilion by the shore, set against an expansive, level-distance vista, a composition that is closely related to his psychological selfhood during the turbulent years of the late Yuan period characteristic of peasant revolts and dynastic change. He painted virtually the same compositions throughout his entire life and saw them as symbolic of himself and his world. The dramatic change in his life from a wealthy landowner to a lone wanderer living in a houseboat played a central role in making him a noble recluse expressing his self in paintings. Ni Zan became something of a legend in later times embodying the essence of literati painting. Ni’s “empty pavilion” imagery became the enduring model for later painters who found in his simplicity of style and independence of spirit a source of inspiration. He was not one of the “Four Great Masters” until the late Ming period when eminent cultural luminaries such as Dong Qichang (1555-1636) attempted to replace Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322) with him. Late Ming literati made concerted efforts to establish Ni Zan as a cultural hero representing the ideals of elegance, loftiness, and detachment. Popular imagination further helped the veneration of Ni Zan as a noble recluse. Popular stories about Ni such as his obsession with cleanliness gained wide currency and came to be frequently retold in the late Ming and Qing periods. Recent studies, however, have offered different accounts of Ni Zan, the most politically disengaged and eccentric of late Yuan painters. He has been considered a lofty recluse in self-imposed isolation pursuing the aesthetics of remoteness, solitude, tranquility, and refinement in paintings. Ni Zan was, in fact, not detached from worldly concerns. He socialized actively with government officials and local magistrates and created poems and paintings for them. Ni was never isolated. Ni was under constant pressure to complete commissioned paintings. He was busy responding to clients’ and patrons’ requests. This image of Ni Zan is completely different from what we have of him. Recent revisionist readings of Ni’s character and relationship to the conditions of his age have offered an insight into the ways in which his reputed “pure loftiness” has been historically and culturally constructed. The invention of Ni Zan is inseparable from the long historical process in which our way of perceiving and interpreting the painter has been formulated. The contradictory accounts and competing interpretations of Ni Zan will lead us to look into how changes in interpretive practices, critical vocabularies, cultural demands, and the intervention of influential critics serve to create the image of the late Yuan painter as a cultural hero. Examination of each period’s changing perceptions of Ni will shed light on the ways in which the painter was transformed from an eccentric in early times into a noble recluse embodying a moral ideal in later periods."

This transformation of Hirohito, led by GHQ with US government`s delegation, was realized on visual dimension, too. Hirohito`s visual metamorphosis was epitomized in the `emperor`s new clothes`. The new image of the Showa emperor in suit with a felt hat replaced his old image as generalissimo, and heavily contributed to hiding his war responsibilities. The photograph of Hirohito and MacArthur, though a reminder of the pains of the war defeat and a symbol of emperor`s fall from grace, also launched the production and distribution of the images of the emperor clad in new clothes. In that photograph, the Showa emperor was no more a living god. He was a victim suffering from the defeat of war, and a partner of US power separated from the Japanese militarists. With the `Humanity Declaration` of Showa emperor, Ministry of the Imperial Household began to produce and distribute the photographs of the humanized emperor and imperial family. Those pictures presented Showa emperor not as a man of war, but as a model family man to the American public as well as to the Japanese people."
Nonenzymatic Electrochemical Immunosensor Using Ferroferric Oxide–Manganese Dioxide–Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanocomposite as Label for α-Fetoprotein Detection,2016,"['Nonenzymatic immunosensor', 'Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticle', 'reduced graphene oxide', 'hybrid nanocomposite', 'α-fetoprotein']",,"A novel nonenzymatic electrochemical immunosensor was fabricated for quantitative detection of α-fetoprotein (AFP). The immunosensor was constructed by modifying gold electrode with electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide-carboxyl multi-walled carbon nanotube composites (ERGO–CMWCNTs) and electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for effective immobilization of primary antibody (Ab1). Ferroferric oxide–manganese dioxide–reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (Fe3O4@MnO2–rGO) were designed as labels for signal amplification. On one hand, the excellent electroconductivity and outstanding electron transfer capability of ERGO–CMWCNTs/AuNPs improved the sensitivity of the immunosensor. On the other hand, introduction of rGO could not only increase the specific surface area for immobilization of secondary antibody (Ab2) but also build a synergetic effect to reinforce the electrocatalytic properties of catalysts. Fe3O4@MnO2–rGO nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Using AFP as a model analyte, the proposed sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor exhibited a wide linear range of 0.01–50 ng · mL-1 with a low detection limit of 5.8 pg · mL-1. Moreover, the Fe3O4@MnO2–rGO-based peroxidase mimetic system displayed an excellent analytical performance with low cost, satisfactory reproducibility and high selectivity, which could be further extended for detecting other disease-related biomarkers."

Christian churches have also underlined the importance of material blessings from God, and sought to become megachurches. It is extremely difficult for anyone to avoid the influence of this significantly corrupt structure and the consequences of its existence in both Korean society and the church. The need for critical pedagogy for Christian adults has become urgent, as it is now imperative individuals become aware of the aforementioned crisis. Christian adults must be educated on how to interpret and analyze the crisis, participate in various critical discourse about the crisis, and help transform society. The purpose of this study is to explore the important tasks of the critical adult learning, by studying Jesus’ parables which are ideal models of critical pedagogy for Christian adults. I will study critical theories of adult learning, with a particular focus on theories influenced by Paulo Freire and Jürgen Habermas, to better understand the critical theory of Christian adult learning. Also, I will investigate the literary criticism of John Dominic Crossan and Bernard B. Scott, and the social-scientific criticism of William Herzog to better study Jesus’ parables.   This study points out five characteristics of Jesus’ teaching that used parables. First, Jesus helped adults have opportunities for self-reflection through self-confrontation. Second, Jesus challenged conventional beliefs and systems, and encouraged adults to develop post-conventional thinking and faith. Third, Jesus encouraged people to critically analyze personal problems in their social contexts. Fourth, Jesus awakened people's numbness of other's suffering, and empowered them to foster compassion and empathetic solidarity. Finally, Jesus showed the vision of the Kingdom of God and urged people to participate in transformative activities. Based on important insights from Jesus’ educational methods shown in the parables, I suggest three tasks of critical learning for Christian adults. First, the church needs to make an effort to form learning communities for public faith. Second, Christian adults need to participate in project groups in order to find and clarify social issues for critical reflection and public discourse. Third, Christian education should empower adults to foster empathetic solidarity and practice social diakonia."

Bergson affirms the invention, not as the mechanical fabrication, but as related with the creation of Life, on the basis of Metaphysics of Life. On the other hand, Simondon universalizes the invention both as a transductive operation for the problem-solving and as a capability of the relationship and communication, on the basis of Individuation Theory. Though Simondon criticizes Bergson on the dichotomous frame(between nature and technology, life and matter) and anthropological-pragmatic thinking of technology, he elevates the concept of invention to the status of a paradigm of information technology, by transductively using those conceptual tools(problem-solving, abstract-concrete, intuition, continuity-discontinuity, leap, etc.) provided by Bergson. The two philosophers’ ontological, psychological and sociological considerations of the invention, including the analyses of the operational principles of inventive imagination, the pedagogical values and an active role of the invention for the social transformations, reveal themselves as model cases of a philosophical analysis by which the existing approaches of Sociology of Technology and Cultural History about the invention can be complemented."

The Pearl Buck, the author of Good Earth, also praised Hangul as `Hangul has the most simple word structure in the world, but it can surprisingly express any sound by combine the consonants and vowels.` The excellence of Hangul is the excellence of philosophical structure embedded in the principles of inventing Hangul. In iconography system interpretation, Hangul is the character system made of trichotomy world view. Hangul, in its Hunminjeongeum Haerye Edition Introduction which explained the principles of invention, described as `Hangul is based on the three principles, heaven, earth and man. So the posterity cannot change in their discretion.`. Also, according to the Sejong chronicles, it is written as `the Korean alphabet was based on the classic letters, so it is not brand-new letter. The principles of pronunciation was newly invented, but the letters were emulated from the format of ancient classic letters`. Hangul made the 3 basic letters to consonant and vowel each, and expanded the characters by transforming these basic letters. The consonant was modeled from the shape of circle, triangle and rectangle. The vowel was modeled from dot, line and stroke. Like this, there was no object that Hangul could not express, by using 3 principles of consonants and vowels. Hangul also applies trichotomy philosophy by dividing the letter into initial, medial, and final consonant phoneme. This is the uniqueness that only Hangul possesses. Trichotomy can be seen to apply the notion of 3 principles (三才), heaven, earth and men. If scrutinizing its shape, it directly applies the placement and the direction of these 3 principles into the shape of the words. The initial phoneme is a consonant, so it becomes the leader to draw out the shape and direction. Then the medial is the vowel, which becomes the body for the center of the change. Then, the last one is the final phoneme, which works as a motive for the next word to come out. Like this, Hangul contains its basic 3 principles in every word. From this special phonemic structure, when conceiving the word, the brain acknowledges in spatial matter. The ways to read and write in Hangul is the natural measure to understand the basic principles of nature. Hangul is the only writing system made a philosophical concept. Philosophical concepts created Hangul has included a unique reason for Koreans. So this assay dominate Hangul is Philogram."

Especially, this model is based on a premise that the relationship between role stress and organizational commitment is moderated by leadership type. Hence this research tried to classify the type of leadership into two categories(trasactional leadership and transformational leadership).  Results showed as follows: first, role conflict negatively affected on the affirmative commitment, whereas Role ambiguity positively affected on the affirmative commitment.  Secondly, the moderating effects of leadership were different in follower’s situation. To put it concretely, in a role conflict situation, the transactional leadership was to further aggravate both affective commitment and normative commitment than transformational leadership. On the other hands, transactional leadership was more efficient when the followers are suffering in role ambiguity.   Based on the presented results, there is no single way of leading to enhance organizational effectiveness. Namely, every leadership style should be based on certain situation where their subordinates are.  Because modern society has been changed to NPS, police officer cannot help going through role stress. Therefore we should design to manage role stress of police officer for not only organizational effectiveness but also the safety of the people.  The researchers tried to suggest public administrative and public policy implication in the aspects of national development as well as the satisfaction of individual police officers. We hope this study would strive to contribute to designing the future policy."

In this context, the case of Hong Kong system shows us the interesting phenomenon that tells us how traditionally elite-centered higher education system embraces the demand of lifelong continuing learning. This study analyzed the trend and progress of creating new governance structure of universities and reviewed the governance system and operational methods of professional and continuing education in Hong Kong. For this, through the process of conversion into complex system of higher education and lifelong learning, a marketing model that satisfies generalization of higher education creates profits by itself at the same time was applied to non-degree courses and other transformed continuing education courses. As a result, in the case of Hong Kong, considered only with the function and governance structure of universities, showed ecological context that enables very unique structural transformation; in this regard, higher education in Hong Kong has a so-called ‘two families under one roof’ system that includes: (1) the boundary of traditional university, (2) segregated degree-supplying structure for demands for elitist and universal higher education, (3) modularized ecosystem supplying non-degree programs that can be separated and combined, and (4) possibility of transferring higher levels through learning outcomes and degrees. This provides a few important implications in establishing higher level of lifelong learning system, in that they have developed higher educational system where various systems coexist, and degree programs and non-degree programs and academic degrees and professional certificates are converged and shared at the same time, beyond the system that focuses on 4-year university and degree system in South Korea. On the other hand, it is undeniable that the system has divided the ecosystem of higher education and lifelong learning into those with public fund and private costs."

According to the comparative analysis of the level, it turned out that Japan obtained the highest level of privatization while South Korea ranked the lowest level. According to the research result of examination and certification ability of private institutions of our country, it turned out that our country is expected to have possibility of achieving higher level of privatization than that of the present. Moreover, according to the questionnaire survey conducted to the persons concerned regarding privatization direction, they gave positive response to all the indicated survey contents of privatization direction in terms of “delegation of certification services to private sectors (contracting-out)”, “transformation of EMC into private voluntary standard” and “changeover of conformity assessment agent”. However, from the view of acceptance and conflict model, it is estimated that starting from “delegation of certification services to private sectors (contracting-out)” seems to be the most advisable plan. Also, prior to privatization, it is required to improve relevant systems such as certification examiner system."

They employed ""Gasa,"" one of representative styles of popular literature in Joseon, and spread the true self search training method among the public.  Living in almost the same times as him, Zen Master Hakmyeong presented the theories and practices to change the reality and society.  The vogue initiated by Zen Masters Gyeongheo and Hakmyeong was spread to Zen Masters Yongseong, Mangong, and Hanam and developed into social transformation and practice movements based on true self search through Zen meditation study such as the oneness movement of Zen and agriculture, independence movement, and translation project of Buddhist scriptures into Korean. The Gasa style was also used actively in those movements.  The true self search and social change movements during the times evolved into the movements of people rather than those of intellectuals and Buddhist leaders through the active utilization of Gasa style, thus holding huge significance. Moving those movements forward, they earned an insight into what kind of efforts the Buddhist community should make during the confusing transition period between the end of 19th century and the beginning of 20th century and translated their insights into popular movements through the awakening of people as well as leaders. Those movements represent the new intellect and movement of Buddhism completely different from Joseon."

In reality, however, every relationship includes competitive as well as cooperative elements. No matter how competitive inter-firm dynamics are, there are also cooperative and trust factors affecting the relationship. Thus it is difficult to see competition and cooperation as independent but interacting concept of a relationship. The business strategy called co-opetition(hereafter coopetition) means that a firm cooperates with rivals, while at the same time it competes with these partners. The main reasons that are mentioned as a motivation for co-opetition are “shrinking product life cycles, need for heavy investments in research and development, convergence of multiple technologies, and importance of technological standards” (Gnyawali & Park, 2011 p. 650). According to previous studies, the most common motives for firms to engage in coopetition are to develop new markets, to enforce competitive advantages or industry standards, to share the costs of research and development, and to improve the profit of firms in participating the relationship.Since the entertainment industries are the result of the union of several sectors (ranging from music, movie, drama, ICT, to publishing and broadcasting), they naturally involve many participants in value chains which were once independent. Not only the entertainment industries are typically dominated by uncertainty, but also the traditional media and entertainment value chain has been transformed dramatically. These are exactly the same issues that the entertainment and media industries face. Generally, it is known that coopetition emerges from the increasing uncertainty and interdependence between firms in complex industries. Nevertheless, coopetition between firms of entertainment industry has been discussed rarely in academic sectors. Therefore, this study looks into existing research and findings on coopetition strategy, which could be of use for the entertainment and media industries through a case study of SM Entertainment.This study observed four different motives of coopetition in the entertainment industry based on the case study of SM. First, it was found that SM uses a coopetition strategy to supplement any lacking experience and to minimize the risks of failure in developing the foreign markets. Coopetition strategy was a powerful means of developing new market opportunities and complementing the lack of experience in foreign markets. Second, SM promotes coopetition with competitors to maximize the efficiency of resource use in their development of differentiated contents. Thus, cooperation with competitors was able to offer the advantage of a combination of the need to develop new contents as a result of competition while accessing new resources as a consequence of cooperation. Third, SM expands their business to various areas to maximally utilize their contents and upon this, they promote cooperation with even potential competitors in various areas to diversify their profitability. Fourth, SM cooperates with competitors as a strategy to secure and supplement their existing contents to strengthen and expand their dominance in existing markets. This study presents implications that such cooperation between competitors in various areas in the entertainment business ultimately greatly contributes to value creating and to expanding the domestic entertainment industry. These implications mean that the coopetition strategy is able to apply this model to the business and management practice of entertainment industry."

The specific results and conclusions are as follows. Firstly, Namgung teacher had realized two unique extracurricular such as enterprise sponsored caring program and learning clinic as a thematic model of ‘Harmony School Project’ by developing and evaluating extracurricular programs. Also, he had overcome the limit of existing ‘Hakbulism’ in Korean society through unfolding extracurricular activity, which is suitable for students of a small middle school in rural area. In the end, he harmonized improvement of school achievement and fostering of personality. The small size of school had become a generative power for holistic growth and development of a middle school students. Secondly, Namgung teacher had changed a ‘small’ middle school into a ‘good’ middle school by demolishing boundary between school and community. And then, he had built a school into a school as community. Also, he considered parents as not objects of enlightenment but partners of education for building a small and good school. The results of this paper will be useful for understanding on the inner transformation process and dynamics of a small size school."

Basic materials for this study were based on intertextuality- related articles and news regarding news photographs. The framework of research analysis followed the analysis model of “Intertextual Politics” proposed by the modified theory of Fairclough Norman(CDA), and this study was carried out according to proposed text description, text deconstruction, text practice and discourse control. The result shows that governmental coping methods with disaster were all used as a political instrument. It also demonstrates that, even after critical explanation and discourse prediction based on the news photographs, the government exerts with control through another intervention. In sum, the fundamental problems of disaster coping still remain unsolved. The reason why disastrous incidents transform into political issues consists in the protection of privileged class. Also, the reason why discourse control is enhanced again is explained by defensive political situations."

It is very remarkable that this phenomenon, which can not be found in analogy to the texts of zainichi, appeared in the popular culture area because it is 'similar' to the consumption of Japanese society in the following years.“GO” and “blood and bones” are common ties in the modern Japanese culture is a ‘conservative father’ almost hidden trace. Both of these works have a structure in which the main character, “Father's Story,” looks at the direction of the “story of his children”, which is a typical story in traditional zainichi literature. It is true that there is enough room to see. However, if you look closely, you can see that both films form an image in the form of strengthening the father's physicality in the film' reproduction 'process. “GO” emphasizes the father's “physicality” in order to let the son choose a life that is faithful to the “everyday sense” rather than the “body” and “idea” rather than the “theory”, and “blood and bones” And the father of ‘transcendental human image’ that excludes the property of ‘father’ is created through strengthening. This can be attributed to the strategy that was intended to simplify the complex narrative structure of the original work in the process of reproducing the popular culture. Despite this transformation, both works faithfully convey the theme of the original work, It succeeds in bringing out.On the other hand, if consumption in Japan of zainichi text since the 2000s is based on a conservative patriarchal image that has been largely ignored in contemporary Japanese culture, Japanese society has newly established a gender role model for men and women after the bubble economy collapse in the 1990s It is also possible that the company is consuming 'Father's Award' in Japan. If the desire of Japanese society to summon a traditional men's prize was expressed by the consumption of the zainichi text and it succeeded in the success of these two works, these examples will be used to expand the overall culture of zainichi, It is necessary to set a more stable future."

Such a movement was also emerged in Colonial Korea. Minami Jiro(南次郞) appointed as the Governor General of Korea in Aug. 1936 felt keenly the necessity and roles of Economic General Staff. However, the outbreak and expansion of Sino-Japanese War in July 1937 substantially distorted and transformed the plan of Minami Jiro. While the Planning Department using the word ‘Planning’ for the first time was organized under Governor General of Korea in Nov. 1939, it couldn`t help acting merely as the subordinate office of the Planning Board in Japan because National Mobilization Law was enforced. After the liberation from Japan in Aug. 1945 and under the US military government, the American planning system was combined. Since then, it was generally agreed to establish a powerful government authority for planning economic affairs through the discussion on government organization and the Constitution of Korea. Accordingly, the Planning Agency was organized as the core institution for planned economy on the basis of the Korea Constitution and Government Organization Act in July 1948. The Planning Agency executed the intrinsic functions of Economic General Staff including extensive survey on economic affairs, auditing on budget plans and coordination of policies among government departments. In particular, Hyun-jun Jung(鄭顯準), the chief secretary who had the experience as the government officer in Manchukuo, played the important roles in selecting the manager-level officers and establishing the management plans in the Planning Agency. However, the Planning Agency was pushed away by Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Commerce and Industry insisting the free economy system without progressive support from the President Syngman Rhee(李承晩) in the rapidly changing political events in early 1949. Furthermore, the outbreak of Korean War in June 1950 stroke the fatal blow to the Planning Agency and planned economy. After all, the Economic General Staff in the First Republic of Korea couldn`t help being disappeared even without realization of original idea. However, the Economic Planning Board newly organized in July 1961 was the perfect model completing the Korean-style Economic General Staff. Including military-style order of rank, planning reminding the establishment of war strategy, goal orientation and rapidity like capturing advantageous position, unity emphasizing the omni-directional cooperation, mobilization of personal and material resources and professionalism of knowledge, all these intrinsic functions of Economic General Staff implemented in the Economic Planning Board became the critical elements realizing the distinguished growth of Korean economy since 1960s."

This contradicts the existence of the steady state dune fields on the Earth. The recent studies have emphasized dune collisions as a key mechanism to the stability of dunefield. The roles of wind shadow aspect ratio, however, have yet to be fully explored. This research aims to investigate the potential roles of wind shadow aspect ratio in the dynamical behaviors of transverse dune field. The simplified model is established for this, based upon allometric properties of transverse dunes, wind speedup on the stoss slope and sand trapping efficiency. The derived governing equations can be transformed to the zoning criteria and vector field for dune evolution. The dynamics analysis indicates that wind shadow aspect ratios do not produce convergent areas on the behavior space; rather, they just act as one of the factors that affect the trajectories of dune evolution. Though the model cannot represent the stability of dune field, but seem to produce a reasonable exponent for dune spacing-height relations."

Since social media appeared, it has started to take a role as a media platform where multimedia contents are developed and consumed by moving beyond a tool for sharing simple text and profiles. In this situation, this study takes notice of a functional transformation of social media and proposes a theoretical model for inducing more participation from users and an increase of whole welfare of users. Establishing the model, we consider uses and gratifications theory, two-sided market and gamification to explore requirements of a media platform for active users and interpret structure of social media as a two-sided market and reveal effects of gamification that gratifies desires of users.By verifying the model, we intend to prove the influence of game mechanisms to gratifying motives of users and the improvement of whole welfare. Randomly extracted 646 posts from Instagram and accumulated data from those are obtained. The more hashtags are tagged in a certain post, the more increased utilities of producers and audiences in social media. Moreover, a growth of producers’ utilities causes an increase of new followers of the post’s producer and a growth of audiences’ utilities causes an increase of new posts of the post’s producer."

Oaxaca요인분해법을 이용하여 계층의식 정도 격차의 요인분해를 하면 도시와 농촌 간 주관적 계층의식 격차의 대부분은 가구소득의 격차에 의한 것이고, 다음으로 교육수준의 격차에 의한 것이다.","This study analyzes the determinants of class consciousness by using the survey data based on subjective definition of class. ‘The 2015 Social Survey’ gives 6 choices of class (Upper High, Lower High, Upper Middle, LowerMiddle, Upper Low, Bottom Low). By using this class choices and the other socioeconomic variables, a subjective class consciousness function, based on the ordered logit model, is estimated. The results of estimation show thateducation level and income level have positive relationships with class consciousness. In addition, other things being equal, house ownership (compared with rental), married status (compared with unmarried, widowed,and divorced), agricultural and fishery sector (rather than the other sectors), and rural (rather than urban) residents showed higher class consciousness.If we transform the degree of subjective class consciousness into cardinal numbers from 1 (the lowest level) to 6 (the highest level), average score for the urban residents, 2.71 is greater than that of rural residents, 2.60. This isresult is not consistent with the previous estimation results of subjective class consciousness function, The inconsistency between two results comes from the differences in explanatory variables of subjective class consciousness function, Urban residents usually have higher values in socioeconomic variables such asincome and education levels than rural residents. Oaxaca factor decomposition shows that the differences in subjective class consciousness between urban and rural residents are mainly from household income differences and differences in education comes next."

Since the reunification in 1990, administrative reforms in Germany have been discussed in various ways. Mainly, private management methods were introduced as a strategy to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the government in the administrative process. However, since 2000, the transformations and the general procedure of internal administrative matters in Germany have been newly discussed in collaboration with challenges related to the information and communication technology (IT). Mainly, the key questions such as political, financial, economic and social factors have been analyzed. The financial and political factors largely determined action in the administrative reform process, but also economic and social factors may increase administrative costs and social costs, and therefore appear to have a significant impact on the course of the administrative reform. A typical case of an administrative reform can be found in the State of Brandenburg. For example, the provincial government of Brandenburg sought to simplify the administration through drastic organizational restructuring and contraction as a new model for a possible administrative reform. In this case, the key elements of the administrative reforms were implemented on the basis of political support and assistance. Despite many challenges such as the outflow of a large part of the populace in Brandenburg, the government of this province succeeded to minimize conflicts resulting from the restructuring process of the municipalities and administrative districts through many discussions and various meetings to exchange opinions of the political leaders who are responsible for the administrative process."

The vision of “new creation” accomplished by Jesus Christ enables us to lament and to cherish the hope from a place of deep suffering. In order to pursue the ministry of reconciliation continuously, we will get the will to live out the spirituality of reconciliation in our daily life.In the scriptures, Mary is a strong and courageous woman of faith who listens to the words of God, puts them into practice, and explores her own life with a clear identity and a sense of vocation. Mary is also a servant leader in the community, expanding her horizon beyond her personal life. Mary reveals herself as a model of transformational and servant leadership who can lead us to the ministry of reconciliation over the long haul."

But at the same time Paris shows the historicization process to preserve and restore historic monuments of the past. Subsequently the ‘Vieux Paris’ considered negatively until the end of the 18th Century was rediscovered from an aesthetic point of view with the wave of romanticism in the early 19th century. This cultural trend was connected with the July monarchy""s policy in order to establish a new national identity. Louis-Philippe, the ‘Citizen-King’ and François Guizot, Minister of Interior wanted to make the July monarchy stand, in the name of ‘nation’, as synthetic successor of the past dynasty and the French Revolution. In this context, they started the policy of preservation and restoration of the historic monuments, models of common national memories. The practice of preservation and restoration led by Viollet-le-Duc was constantly advanced despite the political upheavals like the Revolution of 1848, Coup d""État of Louis Bonaparte and the establishment of the Second Empire. But it was forced to collide with various realistic and administrative problems, in particular with the Haussmann""s renovation of Paris under the Second Empire. After the inauguration of the Democratic government of the Third Republic, the practice of Viollet-le-Duc was clashed with new resistance. In criticizing the previous concepts and practices centered around the national model and the Middle Ages, the young historians and archeologists insisted the expansion of period from the Antiquity to the Modern Age and the inclusion of ruins about people""s everyday life. In this way, the policy of historic monuments changed from the establishment of the national model to the civil education of the History. This evolution of the 19th Century Paris gives two meanings. It shows, on one hand, the double relationship that the historicization against the modernization was in fact the product of the latter, and on the other, the transformation of the national identity around the policy of historic monuments."

As the scope of the study, research questions were created to investigate potential factors of anger in which elementary school students typically experience negative sentiment through team game activities; 1) what does moderation mean toward anger sentiment in team games? 2) is it possible to maintain moderation from brain scientific perspective? 3) what is humanistic educational environment for maintaining moderation? As results, following were revealed; 1) moderation in anger sentiment is ‘mild’, and meaning of moderation point in team games requires understanding of the weak and self-control against the strong, 2) Aristoteles optimistically viewed the possibility of discovering and maintaining moderation from brain scientific point of view. In this regard, he suggested a reasonable ground that rationality can control and adjust irrationality, and concretely identified that emotion induction is generated through interactions between recognition and physiology as well as the fact that recognition and physiology pass through comprehensive process during emotion induction. 3) Thirdly, it is noticeable that ‘descriptive approach’ is recently preferred in moral education for personality training (education). Descriptive approach is popular in physical education in which the goal is to develop (moral) personality. For that reason, from the descriptive perspective, it is introduced as a model of instruction which includes responsibility to transform characters, unity, and team game to develop personality."

Generally, according to the previous studies, it is known that entrepreneurship positively affects economic growth and the reduction of unemployment rate through employment creation. The analysis of the impact of entrepreneurial activities on economic growth and job creation is mainly based on national comparative analysis. In this paper, however, the impact of start-up activities in the Busan metropolitan city on regional economic growth and employment improvement. In this study, the dummy variables were assigned to firms within three years, five years, and ten years after start-up according to the period since the start-up of the firm. .As a result of the empirical analysis, the value of dummy variable of the start - up firms was found to be significant in the analysis of the sales growth rate as the dependent variable according to the preceding study by Evans(1987). Therefore, it can be seen that the growth rate of the start - up company is higher than that of the other companies and it is positive for the regional economic growth. In addition, the coefficient of the dummy variable decreases from the enterprise analysis to the latter within three years, five years, and ten years after the start-up, and confirms that the coefficient of the firm's start-up years has a negative value. I could see more clearly.On the other hand, in the analysis of the effect of start-up firms on unemployment rate reduction, the growth rate of regular workers was higher than that of other firms. This suggests that it positively affects the reduction of the unemployment rate in the region. In addition, in the dynamic analysis using the Almon estimation formula and the Koyck model, the effect of log-transformed net start-up firms on the growth rate of new workers is very significant. As a result of the above model, It is reaffirmed that start-up activity has a positive effect on employment growth."
스페인 1978년 헌법의 성립과정에 관한 연구,2016,"['스페인 1978년 헌법', '헌법제정', '기본법', '정치개혁을 위한 법률', '법적 연속성', '콘센소', 'Spain 1978 Constitution', 'Constitution-making', 'Fundamental Laws', 'Law for Political Reform', 'Legal continuity', 'Consenso']","평화적 체제전환을 배경으로 하는 1978년 스페인의 헌법제정과정은 혁명이나 건국 등 기존 체제와의 법적 단절을 계기로 하는 고전적 헌법제정의 모습과는 다른 양상을 보였다. 이 글은 스페인 1978년 헌법의 성립과정을 법적·제도적 관점에 주로 초점을 맞추어 살펴보고 그 특성과 함의를 도출하는 것을 목표로 한다. 스페인 내전 이후 성립한 프랑코 체제는 1938년부터 1967년까지 순차적으로 제정된 7개의 기본법을 최고법으로 하고 있었다. 이 체제는 국가원수와 행정부수반, 군통수자의 지위를 프랑코에게 독점시킨 권력집중, 국가와 카톨릭 교회의 강한 결합, 다양한 중간집단과 직능집단을 대표하는 비민주적 의회 등을 특징으로 하였다. 프랑코 사망 이틀 후인 1975년 11월 22일 즉위한 후안 카를로스 1세는 1976년 7월 3일 아돌포 수아레스를 수상으로 임명하였다. 수아레스는 보통, 평등, 비밀선거에 의해 구성되는 민주적인 하원과 국왕이 의원정수의 1/5까지 임명할 수 있는 상원을 신설하는 동시에 헌법개혁의 발의를 위한 근거규정을 마련한 「정치개혁을 위한 법률안」을 프랑코주의 의회에 8번째 기본법으로서 제출한다. 위 법안의 통과는 실질적으로 구의회의 폐기를 의미하였음에도 의회는 1976년 11월 18일 위 법안을 가결시켰고, 위 법률을 근거로 1977년 6월 15일 스페인에서는 40여년 만의 자유선거가 실시되었다. 선거로 구성된 새 의회는 곧 헌법제정작업에 착수하였다. 하원 헌법위원회 내부의 소위원회, 헌법위원회, 본회의를 거쳐 성립한 하원 초안을 상원이 위원회와 본회의 수준에서 순차적으로 심의하였고, 양원의 의견이 다른 부분에 대하여는 양원 합동위원회가 최종안을 작성하여 각 원의 본회의에 제출하였다. 의회 양원이 승인한 헌법안은 국민투표로 확정되었고, 최종적으로 국왕이 이를 공포하였다. 스페인의 헌법제정과정에서는 의회내 위원회와 본회의를 통하여 진행된 명시적 과정과 정부, 의회, 정당이 공식절차와 별도로 도달한 주요한 정치·사회적 합의가 헌법에 반영되는 암묵적 과정이 병행되었다. 새로운 헌법은 근본적인 체제전환의 표현이었음에도 그 성립의 절차와 과정에 있어 법적 연속성을 유지하였고, 기존 체제의 제도인 의회와 「정치개혁을 위한 법률」이라는 중간적·임시적 법적 장치가 중요한 역할을 하였다. 또한 의회와 정당들이 실질적인 헌법안의 성립과정을 주도하였다. 새로운 헌법은 군주제와 공화제의 선택, 국가와 교회의 관계, 지역 자치의 범위 등 핵심쟁점에서 대립하는 정파들의 견해를 최대한 절충시킨 합의의 결과였다. 헌법제정의 긴 과정은 이러한 합의를 도출하기 위한 환경이자 조건이 되었으나, 애매성과 복합성을 특징으로 하는 일부 헌법규정에서도 확인할 수 있는 것처럼 당시의 합의 - ‘콘센소’ - 는 완전한 것이 아니었고, 장래의 추가적인 문제해결을 요청하는 것이었다.","Spain's Constitution-making of 1978 which took place during the transition to democracy displayed a different mode of Constitution-making with regard to the classical models of Constitution-making based on legal ruptures such as revolution or state-building. This study sets out to explore some of the legal and institutional aspects of this Constitution-making process in order to grasp its distinctive features and implications. The legal framework of the Franquist regime consisted of 7 Fundamental Laws enacted subsequently from 1938 to 1967. This legal order was a reflection of the regime's authoritarian character such as the concentration of power in a personal figure, strong connection of the church and the state and the presence of a corporatist, non-democratic Parliament(Cortes). On November 22th 1975, Juan Carlos Ⅰ succeeded Franco's status as the Head of the State upon his death and appointed Adolfo Suárez as his president of the government on July 3rd 1976. Suárez submitted to the Parliament 「Law for Political Reform」as the 8th Fundamental Law which created a new Parliament comprised of a democratically elected Congress and a Senate whose maximum of 1/5 members could be appointed by the King. The Bill also provided the process of constitutional reform. The Parliament passed this law even though it meant precisely the self-destruction of its very own existence. A general election took place in June 15th 1977 and the new Parliament started to draft a new Constitution shortly afterward. A lengthy process took its course consisting of Congressional subcommittee(Ponencia), Congressional committee, Congressional plenary session, Senate committee, Senate plenary session, Joint committee and plenary session of both Houses. After the draft was approved by the Parliament, it was put to national referendum in which the Spanish people showed its approval. The new Constitution was finally promulgated by the King. The Spanish Constitution-making process involved both explicit process which took place in the Parliament and implicit constituent decisions made by the agreements of the government, the Parliament and the political parties which had a great influence on the outcome of the drafting process. The newly made Constitution expressed a profound transformation of the regime, but its generation was done while maintaining legal continuity. It also was a result of 'consenso' reached by the bargaining processes between diverse political parties over difficult issues such as the form of the state - monarchy or republic -, the relation of the church and the state and the autonomy of regions within the state. The drafting process provided the condition and environment for consensus-building, but the 'consenso' was by no means perfect as it can be seen in certain ambiguous and complex provisions of the Constitution. The problems which these ambiguities pose and the potential solutions for these problems still remain to be seen."

DTM(differential transformation method) was applied to vibration analysis of multi-cracked nonuniform nanobeam based on nonlocal elasticity theory and embedded in an elastic medium. The non-dimensional natural frequencies of this nanobeam were obtained for eoe, crack stiffness and elastic medium stiffness with various boundary conditions. The results obtained by this method was compared with previous works and showed the close agreement between two methods. The important conclusions obtained by this study are as follows : 1. As the length of nanobeam is shorter, the effect of scale coefficient is greater. 2. The locations of crack change non-dimensional natural frequency, In the case of fixed-fixed ends, the non-dimensional natural frequency is the biggest in the first crack location of 0.6L of nanobeam length, and the smallest in both ends. In the case of fixed-free ends, the closer the location of first crack go tho the free end, the bigger the non-dimensional natural frequency. 3. As the stiffness of crack is greater, the non-dimensional natural frequency is smaller, And the effect of crack stiffness is similar on both fixed-free ends and fixed-fixed ends. 4. The bigger the stiffness of elastic medium, the greater the non - dimensional natural frequency."
Facility siting and plant layout optimization for chemical process safety,2016,"['Consequence Modeling', 'Optimization', 'Plant Layout', 'Facility Siting', 'Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA)']",,"Designing the process layout in a chemical plant is a complex and multidisciplinary task requiring input from experts in fields such as chemical, civil, mechanical, and instrument engineering. Plant layout entails the allocation of a given number of facilities on a given piece of land. Determining the optimal distribution of facilities in a plant requires an optimization calculation, including a variety of distance constraints, one of which is related to process safety. A few approaches have been taken to transform consequence analysis, such as toxic gas dispersion and its mitigation as well as the risks of fire and explosions, into mathematical equations as constraints of an optimization problem.An optimization problem with constraints related to safety is not easy to solve given limitations such as nonlinearity, uncertainty, and ethical difficulties in converting human life to costs for calculation purposes. However, safety concerns have increased to the point that developing this type of approach is necessary. The objective of this study was to review the current methodologies for plant layout optimization and to resolve facility siting issues. Process safety concepts are considered with a view to identifying gaps and issues with current methods in order to develop better methodologies for designing safer layouts."

Wide Air-gap Control for Multi-module Permanent Magnet Linear Synchronous Motors without Magnetic Levitation Windings,2016,"['D-axis control', 'Independent vector control', 'MM-PMLSM', 'Position control', 'Wide air-gap control']",,"This paper proposes a wide air-gap control method for the multi-module permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (MM-PMLSM) based on independent vector control. In particular, the MM-PMLSM consists of symmetrical multi-module and multi-phase structures, which are basically three-phase configurations without a neutral point, unlike conventional three-phase machines. In addition, there are no additional magnetic levitation windings to control the normal force of the air-gap between each stator and mover. Hence, in this paper, a dq-axis current control applying a d-q transformation and an independent vector control are proposed for the air-gap control between the two symmetric stators and mover of the MM-PMLSM. The characteristics and control performance of the MM-PMLSM are analyzed under the concept of vector control. As a result, the proposed method is easily implemented without additional windings to control the air-gap and the mover position. The effectiveness of the proposed independent vector control algorithm is verified through experimental results."

The impulsive noise can be generated by multi-path fading effects by complicated indoor structures or interference environments, which causes an increase in demodulation error probability. The proposed pre-processing scheme is performed before a triangulation method to calculate user’s position, and providing reliable input data demodulated from a received signal to the triangulation method. Therefore, we studied and proposed an adaptive threshold function for mitigation of the impulsive noise based on wavelet denoising. Through results of computer simulations for the proposed scheme, we confirmed that Bit Error Rate and Signal-to-Noise Ratio performance is improved compared to conventional schemes."

While Yabunonaka’s three characters’ monologues are individually distinct, they maintain their unity and don’t affect each other. The splitting of Masago’s images towards the characters’ stakeholders is comprised of the old woman’s portrayal and Takehiro’s death. This is evident as these images are bonded and gathered in the paragraphs pertaining to old woman’s portrayal and Takehiro’s death. Just like the work of Theophile Gautier, it is not about one story of one woman, but rather, it is about Masago’s image depictions of one person’s woman who is not one person. It can be concluded that the images of woman portrayed in Akutagawa’s work is like a riddle that has readers puzzled."

Improved DC Offset Error Compensation Algorithm in Phase Locked Loop System,2016,"['DC offset error', 'Compensator', 'PLL', 'Grid-connected converter', 'SRF']",,"This paper proposes a dc error compensation algorithm using dq-synchronous coordinate transform digital phase-locked-loop in single-phase grid-connected converters. The dc errors are caused by analog to digital conversion and grid voltage during measurement. If the dc offset error is included in the phase-locked-loop system, it can cause distortion in the grid angle estimation with phase-locked-loop. Accordingly, recent study has dealt with the integral technique using the synchronous reference frame phase-locked-loop method. However, dynamic response is slow because it requires to monitor one period of grid voltage. In this paper, the dc offset error compensation algorithm of the improved response characteristic is proposed by using the synchronous reference frame phase-locked-loop. The simulation and the experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dc offset error compensation algorithm."
Restructuring and Changes in Occupational Mobility in U.S.,2016,"['employment restructuring', 'occupational mobility', 'deindustrialization', 'boundaryless career', 'labor market dualism']",,"This study aims to estimate the impact of US restructuring during the late 1990s and the early 2000s on workers’ career trajectories, in terms of changes in patterns of occupational mobility. In this study, I introduce various middle range theories that emphasize specific aspects of restructuring and test whether their predictions regarding the impact of restructuring on workers’ careers accurately account for observed patterns of occupational mobility. Based on estimation from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the result shows that the career trajectory of U.S. workers has significantly changed since 1990 and, more importantly, the profiles of the changes have been remarkably different between internal mobility and external mobility. Most notably, occupational immobility has increased among workers who stayed in the same firm and decreased among workers who switched firms. To conclude, employment restructuring in the U.S. appears to have proceeded in a way that incorporates both functional flexibility and numerical flexibility, creating polarized groups of “organizational insiders” and “organizational outsiders.” As a result, workers’ career trajectories have been significantly transformed both inside and outside organizations."

As part of these efforts, a plan for energy savings at the national level has been established. Large cities in each country are major energy consumers. In addition, architects of metropolitan high-rise towers, which are also major energy consumption sources, have committed to establishing institutional mechanisms to reduce the energy consumption of such buildings.  However, designs that consider energy performance have been limited to the introduction of conceptual technology. Energy-saving plans considering energy performance are generally established through heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems only after the design of the tower is determined. By analyzing the mass form determinants, except those for HVAC, in designing a tower, this study analyzed the correlation between the mass form determinants and energy performance of the tower, allowing designers to consider energy performance from the early design stages.  This study then attempted to analyze design strategies for efficient energy reduction, without relying on HVAC, in the phases prior to deciding on a design. In addition, this study attempted to transform the correlation into an equation using the typical floor plan, window area ratio, skin size, floor area, volume, floor height, story height, and aspect ratio, which determine the mass form in the early phase of design. By developing objective design indicators for energy performance based on this equation, this study could be used as basic material for rating the quality of energy performance-based designs, thereby contributing to the growth of low-carbon-footprint green construction."

In fashion, however, due to limitations in printing materials, size and speed, only parts of garments or fashion accessories are manufactured. This research aims to make millineries using domestic 3D printers for the development of their products. A design motif such as a ribbon is used as a playful element. Even if a familiar object, unaccustomed outlook attracts the viewer’s interest, and it naturally leads to interest of products, eventually contributing to the expansion of 3D printing products. Through literature and case studies of 3D printing fashion and millineries, ribbon, ribbon hat and 3D printed ribbon, three hats were produced. The results of the research show that: firstly, 3D printed ribbon is used aesthetically rather than functionally; secondly, ribbon is a useful item to make flat or 3-dimensional shape through CAD modelling; thirdly, ribbon can be used as a functional part of millinery. fourthly, 3D printing is easy to make a characteristic hat using CAD modelling from open source; fifthly, it is easy to attach other materials through modelling; sixthly, post processing can make 3D printed objects looked differently such as metal. Therefore, the ribbon is a useful item to draw viewers’ interest and an efficient item for 3D printing. The 3D printed hat using this motif is good for widening 3D printed products and can eventually contribute to the popularization of 3D printing products. It also widens the scope of development of 3D printing in fashion and millinery."

A How-To Book on Becoming the “Heart of the House”,2016,"['Susan Coolidge', 'What Katy Did', 'Children’s literature', 'problematic representation of nineteenth century women', 'Femininity', 'disability studies']",,"This essay aims to investigate the problematic representation of femininity in Susan Coolidge’s What Katy Did. Nineteenth-century America, is the age when principles of “True Womanhood” prevailed and gender division was strictly upheld. The woman’s place is in the home, society asserted, and the image of the angel in the house was highly idealized, just as it was across the Atlantic. This essay considers, in particular, how female authors, such as Coolidge, enjoyed the freedom afforded them in children’s literature, but at the same time how they ironically tended to uphold the gender hierarchy which had oppressed and confined their female contemporaries. This essay therefore, examines the problematic representation of women in Coolidge’s novel as well as consider the ideological implications behind protagonist Katy’s transformation from tomboy to the “heart of the house.”"

In order to continuously develop first-class products, world wide super-class products and hit products, R&D (Research & Development) must be competitive. Firms must achieve competitiveness in terms of quality and cost by launching new products. Most films focus on improving effectiveness and efficiency of NPD process. However, sometimes, they face to the critical challenge of transforming NPD processes entirely reflecting dramatic change of their core products. Transforming of NPD process is difficult in that it involves technological and organizational changes in marketing, R&D, Engineering and manufacturing systems. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on processes and factors affecting successful transformation of new product development systems. We present a case study on the changing processes of S company’s NPD process. S company has changed new product development systems successfully from a major IT equipment supplier to an automotive supplier. Empirical results show successful changes of 10 core NPD processes from understanding the market and customers process to after sales process. In case of transformation of NPD, adaption of attribute of business is crucial for success factors in the process innovation. This paper shows the bridging the gap between IT and automotive industrial dynamics and growth through adaption of two processes in the NPD."

Co-Rotational plane beam analysis is appropriate for large rotation and small strain. Assuming aircraft wing as a cantilevered beam, natural frequencies of each airfoil cross-sectional shape were estimated using VABS program and fast Fourier transformation(FFT). VABS conducts finite element analysis on the cross-section including the detailed geometry and material distribution to estimate the beam sectional properties. Under the same airfoil geometric configuration and material selection, variation of material induced difference in the deflection and natural frequencies. It was observed that variation of the natural frequency was dependent on variation of the airfoil shape and material."

In Korea, mciro-financial institutions started after 2000, and then 2009 government also intervened micro-finance industry by establishing Smile MicroCredit Bank. This paper aims to make assessment of this trends and its lessons. At the first, it is political basis, the response to plummeting support rate in 2008, that made Korean government to intervene microfinance, leading a transformation from NGOs type microfinance to financial type which is primarily operated by retired employee from commercial bank. Due to this background, Smile MicroCredit Bank recorded very low delinquency rate and much amount of outstanding loan. However, human capital network such as Relationship Manager excluded in the process of loan provision, Korea micro-finance tend to be divergent from its original purpose of poverty reduction and helping the poor. And also it experienced the problem of impaired fund by (-) ROA. In the context of this condition, we suggest three reconsideration about Korea micro-finance. First, is it proper to adapt foreign experience of micro-finance to Korea where saturated small self-management market is? Secondly we need to reconsider what the purpose of micro-finance in Korea is and how to supply credit. And finally is it appropriate for government to involve micro-finance like Smile MicroCredit Bank in Korea?"
