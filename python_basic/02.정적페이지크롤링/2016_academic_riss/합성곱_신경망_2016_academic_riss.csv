합성곱 신경망을 이용한 On-Line 주제 분리,2016,"['주제 분리', '합성곱 신경망', 'Topic Segmentation', 'Convolutional Neural Network']",,"A topic segmentation module is to divide statements or conversations into certain topic units. Until now, topic segmentation has progressed in the direction of finding an optimized set of segments for a whole document, considering it all together. However, some applications need topic segmentation for a part of document which is not finished yet. In this paper, we propose a model to perform topic segmentation during the progress of the statement with a supervised learning model that uses a convolution neural network. In order to show the effectiveness of our model, we perform experiments of topic segmentation both on-line status and off-line status using C99 algorithm. We can see that our model achieves 17.8 and 11.95 of Pk score, respectively,"
딥러닝의 모형과 응용사례,2016,"['딥러닝', '합성곱신경망', '순환신경망', '오류역전파 알고리즘', 'Deep learning', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'Error backpropagation algorithm']",,"Deep learning model is a kind of neural networks that allows multiple hidden layers. There are various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks. Those have been applied to fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition and bioinformatics where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks. Among those architectures, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are classified as the supervised learning model. And in recent years, those supervised learning models have gained more popularity than unsupervised learning models such as deep belief networks, because supervised learning models have shown fashionable applications in such fields mentioned above.  Deep learning models can be trained with backpropagation algorithm. Backpropagation is an abbreviation for “backward propagation of errors” and a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent. The method calculates the gradient of an error function with respect to all the weights in the network. The gradient is fed to the optimization method which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the error function.  Convolutional neural networks use a special architecture which is particularly well-adapted to classify images. Using this architecture makes convolutional networks fast to train. This, in turn, helps us train deep, muti-layer networks, which are very good at classifying images. These days, deep convolutional networks are used in most neural networks for image recognition. Convolutional neural networks use three basic ideas: local receptive fields, shared weights, and pooling. By local receptive fields, we mean that each neuron in the first(or any) hidden layer will be connected to a small region of the input(or previous layer’s) neurons. Shared weights mean that we’re going to use the same weights and bias for each of the local receptive field. This means that all the neurons in the hidden layer detect exactly the same feature, just at different locations in the input image. In addition to the convolutional layers just described, convolutional neural networks also contain pooling layers. Pooling layers are usually used immediately after convolutional layers. What the pooling layers do is to simplify the information in the output from the convolutional layer. Recent convolutional network architectures have 10 to 20 hidden layers and billions of connections between units. Training deep learning networks has taken weeks several years ago, but thanks to progress in GPU and algorithm enhancement, training time has reduced to several hours.  Neural networks with time-varying behavior are known as recurrent neural networks or RNNs. A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. Early RNN models turned out to be very difficult to train, harder even than deep feedforward networks. The reason is the unstable gradient problem such as vanishing gradient and exploding gradient. The gradient can get smaller and smaller as it is propagated back through layers. This makes learning in early layers extremely slow. The problem actually gets worse in RNNs, since gradients aren’t just propagated backward through layers, they’re propagated backward through time. If the network runs for a long time, that can make the gradient extremely unstable and hard to learn from. It has been possible to incorporate an idea known as long short-term memory units (LSTMs) into RNNs. LSTMs make it much easier to get good results when traini"
Development of Prognostics and Health Management System for Rotating Machine and Application to Rotary Table,2022,"['Smart factory (스마트팩토리)', 'Prognostics and health management (건전성 예측 및 관리)', 'Deep learning (딥러닝)', 'Convolutional neural network (합성곱 신경망)']",,"Recently, interest in Prognostics and Health management (PHM) has been increasing as an advanced technology of maintenance. PHM technology is a technology that allows equipment to check its condition and predict failures in advance. To realize PHM technology, it is important to implement artificial intelligence technology that diagnoses failures based on data. Vibration data is often used to diagnose the state of the rotating machine. Additionally, there have been many efforts to convert vibration data into 2D images to apply a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is emerging as a powerful algorithm in the image processing field, to vibration data. In this study, a series of PHM processes for acquiring data from a rotary machine and using it to check the condition of the machine were applied to the rotary table. Additionally, a study was conducted to introduce and compare two methodologies for converting vibration data into 2D images. Finally, a GUI program to implement the PHM process was developed."
