An Efficient Model to Calculate Axial Natural Vibration Frequency of Power Transformer Winding,2016,"['power transformer', 'winding', 'efficient finite element model', 'axial natural vibration frequency']",,"In the design of transformer winding, natural vibration frequency is an important parameter. This paper presents a 2D model to calculate axial vibration natural frequency of power transformer winding based on the elastic dynamics theory, and according to the elastic support equivalent principle of radial pressboards. The 3D model to calculate natural vibration frequency can be simplified as a 2D one as the support of pressboards on the winding is same. It is verified that results of the 2D model are consistent with those of 3D one, but the former can achieve much higher calculation efficiency. It shows that increasing the width and number of pressboards can improve axial natural frequency through formula analysis and simulation, and also the relations between the changes of axial pre-compression and axial natural vibration frequency on the windings are investigated. Finally, the proposed 2D model’s effectiveness is proved when compared with tested ones."
IEC 코드 기반의 뉴로-퍼지모델을 이용한 유입변압기 고장진단 기법,2016,"['Power transformers', 'Neuro-Fuzzy model', 'ANFIS', 'DGA', 'IEC 60599']",,"It has been proven that the dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is the most effective and convenient method to diagnose the transformers. The DGA is a simple, inexpensive, and non intrusive technique. Among the various diagnosis methods, IEC 60599 has been widely used in transformer in service. But this method cannot offer accurate diagnosis for all the faults. This paper proposes a fault diagnosis method of oil-filled power transformers using IEC code based neuro-fuzzy model. The proposed method proceeds two steps. First, IEC 60599 method is applied to diagnosis. If IEC code can""t determine the fault type, neuro-fuzzy model is applied to effectively classify the fault type. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed method, experiment is performed and its results are illustrated."

Modelling and study on the output flow characteristics of expansion energy used hydropneumatic transformer,2016,"['Hydropneumatic transformer', 'Output flow', 'Modeling simulation', 'Experimental study']",,"Hydropneumatic transformer (short for HP transformer) is used to pump pressurized hydraulic oil. Whereas, due to its insufficient usage of energy and low efficiency, a new kind of HP transformer: EEUHP transformer (Expansion energy used hydropneumatic transformer) was proposed. To illustrate the characteristics of the EEUHP transformer, a mathematical model was built. To verify the mathematical model, an experimental prototype was setup and studied. Through simulation and experimental study on the EEUHP transformer, the influence of five key parameters on the output flow of the EEUHP transformer were obtained, and some conclusions can be drawn.Firstly, the mathematical model was proved to be valid. Furthermore, the EEUHP transformer costs fewer of compressed air than the normal HP transformer when the output flow of the two kinds of transformers are almost same. Moreover, with an increase in the output pressure, the output flow decreases sharply. Finally, with an increase in the effective area of hydraulic output port, the output flow increases distinctly. This research can be referred to in the performance and design optimization of the EEUHP transformers."

A Three-phase Hybrid Power Flow Algorithm for Meshed Distribution System with Transformer Branches and PV Nodes,2016,"['Distribution transformer', 'Meshed distribution system', 'Node-branch incidence matrix', 'Power flow', 'PV nodes']",,"Aiming at analyzing the power flow of the distribution systems with distribution transformer (DT) branches and PV nodes, a hybrid three-phase power flow methodology is presented in this paper. The incidence formulas among node voltages, loop currents and node current injections have been developed based on node-branch incidence matrix of the distribution network. The method can solve the power flow directly and has higher efficiency. Moreover, the paper provides a modified method to model DT branches by considering winding connections, phase shifting and off-nominal tap ratio, and then DT branches could be seen like one transmission line with the proposed power flow method. To deal with the PV nodes, an improved approach to calculate reactive power increment at each PV node was deduced based on the assumption that the positive-sequence voltage magnitude of PV node is fixed at a given value. Then during calculating the power flow at each iteration, it only needs to update current injection at each PV node with the proposed algorithm. The process is very simple and clear. The results of IEEE 4 nodes and the modified IEEE 34 nodes test feeders verified the correctness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid power flow algorithm."

A High-efficiency Method to Suppress Transformer Core Imbalance in Digitally Controlled Phase-shifted Full-bridge Converter,2016,"['Approximately digital control', 'Output rectifier', 'Transformer core imbalance', 'Voltage sensor']",,"A high-efficiency method is proposed to suppress magnetic core imbalance in phase-shifted full-bridge (PSFB) converters.

An approximate control algorithm is designed to achieve asymmetric phase control, which reduces the effects of imbalance. A 60 V/15 A prototype is built to verify the proposed method.

As a result, tan δ showed the characteristics of slight decrease at the first stage and then increase with the aging time, which could be analyzed due to the evaporation of remaining moisture and the change of aging rate with time. Also, the trend of tensile strengths with aging temperature and time was appeared to be exponentially decreased and by use of these data equivalent calculated lifetimes and accelerated aging factors were derived for each aging temperatures. After then, tan δ was analyzed with the equivalent operating years.
