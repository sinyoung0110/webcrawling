Evaluation of the Temperature-Dependent Internal Quantum Efficiency and the Light-Extraction Efficiency in a GaN-Based Blue Light-Emitting Diode by Using a Rate Equation Model,2016,"['GaN', 'Light-emitting diode', 'Internal quantum efficiency', 'Light extraction efficiency']",,"The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and the light extraction efficiency (LEE) of a GaN-based blue light-emitting diode (LED) are evaluated separately in the temperature range between 20 to 80 C. The theoretical IQE model based on the carrier rate equation of semiconductors is applied to determine the IQE and the LEE separately from a measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) versus current relation for the LED sample. While the peak EQE of the measured sample decreases by 3.2 % as the temperature increases from 20 to 80 C, it is found that the peak IQE decreases by 4.5 % and the LEE increases by 1.5 %."
6-18 GHz Reactive Matched GaN MMIC Power Amplifiers with Distributed L-C Load Matching,2016,"['0.25 μm Gallium Nitride (GaN) Process', 'Distributed L-C', 'Large-Signal Model', 'Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC)', 'Wideband Power Amplifier']",,"A commercial 0.25 μm GaN process is used to implement 6–18 GHz wideband power amplifier (PA) monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). GaN HEMTs are advantageous for enhancing RF power due to high breakdown voltages. However, the large-signal models provided by the foundry service cannot guarantee model accuracy up to frequencies close to their maximum oscillation frequency (Fmax). Generally, the optimum output load point of a PA varies severely according to frequency, which creates difficulties in generating watt-level output power through the octave bandwidth. This study overcomes these issues by the development of in-house large-signal models that include a thermal model and by applying distributed L-C output load matching to reactive matched amplifiers. The proposed GaN PAs have successfully accomplished output power over 5 W through the octave bandwidth."
Optical characteristics of wet-thermally oxidized bulk and nanoporous GaN,2016,[],,"<P>Gallium nitride (GaN) films deposited on sapphire substrates by metal organic chemical vapor deposition were successfully transformed into bulk and nanoporous gallium oxide (Ga2O3) using a wet thermal oxidation technique. Oxidation depth measurements confirmed that the oxide growth appeared to be faster in the case of nanoporous GaN than that of bulk GaN. Spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to evaluate and compare the optical properties of nanoporous and bulk Ga2O3 films, such as refractive index and extinction coefficient, which revealed improved optical properties for nanoporous Ga2O3 compared to the bulk. The simulations conducted on the ellipsometric spectra for bulk and nanoporous Ga2O3 using the Forouhi-Bloomer model and the Bruggeman effective medium approximation revealed the best fit with a low mean square error value. In the case of nanoporous Ga2O3, zero absorption was observed in the wavelength range of 300 nm to 840 nm, supporting the use of this material as a transparent coating in optoelectronic devices.</P>"
GaN HEMT를 사용한 Half-Bridge 구조에서의 스위치 상호작용에 의한 게이트 전압분석,2016,"['Gallium nitride high electronic mobility transistor (GaN HEMT)', 'Gate driver', 'Parasitic component model', 'Half-Bridge converter']",,"This paper presents the analysis of the gate-source voltage of the gallium nitride high electronic mobility transistor (GaN HEMT) in the half bridge structure focused on the mutual effects of two switching operation. Especially low side gate-source voltage is analyzed mathematically according to the high side switch turn-on and turn-off operation. Moreover, the influence of each gate resistance and parasitic component on the switching characteristic of other side switch is investigated, and the formula, simulation and experimental results are compared with theoretical data."
Investigation of the doping and Stark effects on the band structure and optical absorption of 1.55 mm GaNAsBi/GaAs MQWs,2016,['1.55 mm GaNAsBi/GaAs MQWs n doping Stark effect Absorption coefficient'],,"We present a self-consistent calculation combined with the 16-band anticrossing model in order to investigate the electronic and optical properties of n-doped GaNAsBi/GaAs multiple-QWs operating at 1.55 mm. Optoelectronic features of these quantum structures seem advantageous for the design of photodetector devices. We have found that doping induces a blue shift of the fundamental transition energy for the uncoupled double-QWs with the barrier width Lb ¼ 12 nm. This transition energy shows a red shift when the doped DQWs are coupled (Lb ¼ 2 nm). An applied electric field favors further this shift.The coupling and Stark effects on the spatial distribution of confined electrons density are discussed. The absorption coefficient for the coupled 4 nm GaN.04As.89Bi.07/GaAs DQWs is enhanced compared to the undoped or uncoupled DQWs. Finally, we have examined the dependence of the absorption magnitude on the doping density and electric field for different values of wells number."
Post-buckling responses of elastoplastic FGM beams on nonlinear elastic foundation,2016,"['FGM beam', 'elastoplastic behavior', 'nonlinear elastic foundation', 'eccentric axial load', 'nonlinear finite element analysis']",,"The elastoplastic response of functionally graded material (FGM) beams resting on a nonlinear elastic foundation to an eccentric axial load is investigated by using the finite element method. The FGM is assumed to be formed from ceramic and metal phases with their volume fraction vary in the thickness direction by a power-law function. A bilinear elastoplastic behavior is assumed for the metallic phase, and the effective elastoplastic properties of the FGM are evaluated by Tamura-Tomota-Ozawa (TTO) model. Based on the classical beam theory, a nonlinear finite beam element taking the shift in the neutral axis position into account is formulated and employed in the investigation. An incremental-iterative procedure in combination with the arc-length control method is employed in computing the equilibrium paths of the beams. The validation of the formulated element is confirmed by comparing the equilibrium paths obtained by using the present element and the one available in the literature. The numerical results show that the elastoplastic post-buckling of the FGM beams is unstable, and the post-buckling strength is higher for the beams associated with a higher ceramic content. Different from homogeneous beams, yielding in the FGM beam occurs in the layer near the ceramic layer before in the layer near metal surface. A parametric study is carried out to highlight the effect of the material distribution, foundation support and eccentric ratio on the elastoplastic response of the beams."
Experimental Study on the Motion Process of Radial Retractable Roof Structures,2016,"['radial retractable roof structure', 'whole motion process', 'experimental study', 'deflection', 'bending moment']",,"In recent years, the use of retractable roofs is increasing to meet the demand of holding big-scale events. This article introduces a class of radial retractable roofs based on the foldable bar structure (FBS) mechanism. A radial retractable roof structure whose moveable section consisted of 6 segments and 6 rigid linkages was designed with appropriate parameters. An experimental study of a radial retractable roof was carried out. A scale model with a 3 metre diameter was constructed to study the roof deflection and vibration during the deployment process under four different load cases. Furthermore, based on the multi-flexible body dynamics theory, an ADAMS-ANSYS co-simulation was applied to simulate the motion process of the radial retractable roof structure. The experimental results were consistent with the numerical simulations. This indicates that the dynamic and fluctuation phenomena of structural behaviour are universal. The structural vibration was increased with the increase of external loads, and the vibration amplitude increased significantly when the roof was starting and braking. With the closing of the movable roof, the deflection of the fixed roof increased significantly. In the motion process, the bending moment of the fixed roof gradually increases, while that of the moving roof varies little. Vertical vibration is significant in the motion process by reason of the complex wheel-rail contact."
Critical Short Circuit Ratio Analysis on DFIG Wind Farm with Vector Power Control and Synchronized Control,2016,"['Weak grid', 'DFIG wind farm', 'Vector power control', 'Synchronized control', 'Stability boundar1y', 'Critical short circuit ratio', 'Sensitivity']",,"The introduction of renewable energy sources into the AC grid can change and weaken the strength of the grid, which will in turn affect the stability and robustness of the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind farm. When integrated with weak grids, the DFIG wind turbine with vector power control often suffers from poor performance and robustness, while the DFIG wind turbine with synchronized control provides better stability. This paper investigates the critical short circuit ratios of DFIG wind turbine with vector power control and synchronized control, to analyze the stability boundary of the DFIG wind turbine. Frequency domain methods based on sensitivity and complementary sensitivity of transfer matrix are used to investigate the stability boundary conditions. The critical capacity of DFIG wind farm with conventional vector power control at a certain point of common coupling (PCC) is obtained and is further increased by employing synchronized control properly. The stability boundary is validated by electromagnetic transient simulation of an offshore wind farm connected to a real regional grid."
