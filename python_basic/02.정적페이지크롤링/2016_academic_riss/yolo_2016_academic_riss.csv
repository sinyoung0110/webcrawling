Real-time Human Detection under Omni-directional Camera based on CNN with Unified Detection and AGMM for Visual Surveillance,2016,"['Human Detection', 'Omni-Directional Camera', 'CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)', 'AGMM (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model)', 'Visual Surveillance']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we propose a new real-time human detection under omni-directional cameras for visual surveillance purpose, based on CNN with unified detection and AGMM. Compared to CNN-based state-of-the-art object detection methods. YOLO model-based object detection method boasts of very fast object detection, but with less accuracy. The proposed method adapts the unified detecting CNN of YOLO model so as to be intensified by the additional foreground contextual information obtained from pre-stage AGMM. Increased computational time incurred by additional AGMM processing is compensated by speed-up gain obtained from utilizing 2-D input data consisting of grey-level image data and foreground context information instead of 3-D color input data. Through various experiments, it is shown that the proposed method performs better with respect to accuracy and more robust to environment changes than YOLO model-based human detection method, but with the similar processing speeds to that of YOLO model-based one. Thus, it can be successfully employed for embedded surveillance application."

Rate of softening and sensitivity for weakly cemented sensitive clays,2016,"['sensitive clay', 'shear band', 'strain softening', 'sensitivity', 'cemented soil', 'vane shear', 'strength loss']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The rate of softening is an important factor to determine whether the failure occurs along localized shear band or in a more diffused manner. In this paper, strength loss and softening rate effect depending on sensitivity are investigated for weakly cemented clays, for both artificially cemented high plasticity San Francisco Bay Mud and low plasticity Yolo Loam. Destructuration and softening behavior for weakly cemented sensitive clays are demonstrated and discussed through multiple vane shear tests. Artificial sensitive clays are prepared in the laboratory for physical modeling or constitutive modeling using a small amount of cement (2 to 5%) with controlled initial water content and curing period. Through test results, shear band thickness is theoretically computed and the rate of softening is represented as a newly introduced parameter, ${\omega}_{80%}$. Consequently, it is found that the softening rate increases with sensitivity for weakly cemented sensitive clays. Increased softening rate represents faster strength loss to residual state and faster minimizing of shear band thickness. Uncemented clay has very low softening rate to 80% strength drop. Also, it is found that higher brittleness index ($I_b$) relatively shows faster softening rate. The result would be beneficial to study of physical modeling for sensitive clays in that artificially constructed high sensitivity (up to $S_t=23$) clay exhibits faster strain softening, which results in localized shear band failure once it is remolded."
In silico identification of Bell pepper endornavirus from pepper transcriptomes and their phylogenetic and recombination analyses,2016,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Here, we identified eight Bell pepper endornavirus (BPEV) isolates from nine different pepper transcriptomes. BPEV was present with low copy numbers ranging from 0.01% to 0.18% in the host transcriptome. Phylogenetic identified two different groups of BPEV isolates. Sequence alignment of the five BPEV genomes revealed conservation of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. Recombination analysis identified two possible recombinant events in the isolate Yolo Wonder. Single nucleotide variation profiles revealed the presence of BPEV variants within a single pepper cultivar. Taken together, this study provides phylogenetic and recombination analyses of the genus Endornavirus using pepper transcriptome data."
