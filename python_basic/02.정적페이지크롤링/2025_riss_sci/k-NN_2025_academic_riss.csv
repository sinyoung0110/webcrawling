Fisher-Rao 거리를 이용한 함수형 $k$-최근접 이웃 방법론,2025,"['정렬 방법론', '함수형 분류 모형', '함수형 데이터 분석', '기계학습', '위상 변동', 'alignment', 'functional classification model', 'functional data analysis', 'machine learning', 'phase variation']","함수형 데이터 분석(functional data analysis)의 함수형 관측값들은 기존의 다변량 데이터 분석(multivariate data analysis)의 관측값과 달리 두 가지 성분을 갖는다. 하나는 위상(phase) 성분이고 또 다른 하나는 진폭(amplitude) 성분이다. 따라서 함수형 통계적 분석을 할 경우에는 진폭 변동뿐만 아니라 위상 변동도 함께 고려해줘야 더 효과적인 통계적 분석 및 결과를 도출할 수 있다. 현재 머신러닝의 분류 모형 중 함수형 $k$-최근접 이웃 방법론은 아직 위상변동을 고려하지 않는 분류 모형이다. 따라서 함수형 데이터에 위상적인 오류가 존재할 경우 효과적인 분류를 할 수 없다. 이 논문에서는 기존의 함수형 데이터를 Square-Root Velocity 함수로 변환 후, Fisher-Rao 거리를 이용한 정렬 방법론을 적용하여 새로운 함수형 분류 모형을 제안한다. 이 모형은 기존의 \ltwo 공간에서 발생할 수 있는 여러 문제들을 해결할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라, 기존의 함수형 분류 모형에서 고려하지 못한 위상 변동을 효과적으로 제거하면서 거리를 계산하기에 현존하는 함수형 $k$-최근접 이웃 방법론보다 더 효과적인 분류 성능을 보여줬다. 이는 모의 실험 데이터와 실제 데이터를 통해서 모형의 분류 성능의 우수함을 입증하였다.","In Functional Data Analysis (FDA), functional observations consist of two components: phase and amplitude. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct functional statistical analysis by considering not only amplitude variations but also phase variations. Among the current machine learning classification models, the functional $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$NN) method is a popular approach that does not account for phase variations. As a result, classification performance deteriorates when phase variations are present. In this paper, we propose an elastic functional $k$-nearest neighbors classification method that handles phase variations by incorporating the Fisher-Rao metric-based alignment technique. This model not only addresses several existing issues in the \ltwo space but also effectively removes phase variations. We compare the classification performance using two simulated datasets and six real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."
머신러닝 기반 온라인 학습성과의 최적 예측모델 수립 (Part 1. 학습성취도 예측모델),2025,"['Learning achievement', 'Machine learning', 'Online learning', 'Predictive model', 'Random forest']","본 연구는 온라인 학습성취도 예측모델 수립을 위한 머신러닝 기반 모델 개발을 다루며, 2020년 1월부터 2023년 7월까지 수 집된 공공 직업능력개발 플랫폼 STEP의 데이터를 활용하였다. Random Forest, CART, Gradient Boosting, SVM, K-NN의 5가지 알 고리즘을 비교한 결과, Random Forest 알고리즘이 학습 전 단계와 학습 중 단계 모두에서 가장 높은 정확도를 보였다. 주요 예측 변수로는 사전 설문 만족도, 나이, 진도점수, 학습일수 등이 포함되었으며, 이를 통해 적응형 학습 서비스 구현의 가능성을 확인 하였다. 특히, 온라인 학습 중의 현재 수집 데이터만으로도 대체적으로 만족할 만한 수준의 예측 정확도를 확인하였다.","This study investigates the development of a machine learning-based model.to predict online learning outcomes(academic achievement) in public vocational training platforms, using the STEP dataset from January 2020 to July 2023.

Predictive Modeling of Volume and Biomass in Pinus pseudostrobus Using Machine Learning and Allometric Approaches,2025,"['Forest management', 'machine learning algorithms in forestry', 'predicting forest biomass', 'Random Forest algorithm', 'allometric modeling', 'quantile regression in forest management']",,"This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting key forest metrics—stem volume, root system volume, and organ biomass (including leaves, branches, stem, and root)—for Pinus pseudostrobus var. Lindley, based on morphological measurements from the same trees. The novelty of this study lies in applying five machine learning algorithms—Random Forest, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Machines, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)—to predict these metrics, using data from the destructive analysis of 98 individual trees aged from eight months to five years. For comparison, we also applied univariate allometric models, adjusted with nonlinear least squares and quantile regression. The results indicate that Random Forest, k-NN, and SVM outperformed the other algorithms, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy for both biomass and volume.A key innovation of this study is its demonstration of how machine learning, with its ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships, can serve as a powerful tool for forest management.Quantile regression, combined with nonlinear least squares, proves most effective when the relationships are well-defined, allowing for tailored parameter adjustments that enhance predictions, particularly in the presence of heteroscedasticity."
웨어러블 압력 센서를 이용한 발 압력중심 예측: 데이터 전처리와 증강이 머신러닝 모델에 미치는 영향,2025,"['Wearable pressure sensors', 'Center of pressure', 'Machine learning', 'Data augmentation', 'Gait analysis']","본 연구는 적은 수의 압력센서를 활용하여 보행 시 압력중심(COP, Center of Pressure) 궤적을 예측하고, 데이터 전처리 및 증 강 기법이 예측 성능에 미치는 영향을 분석하였다. 상용 압력 깔창에서 9개의 FSR센서를 선정하여 데이터를 수집하였고, 이를 바탕으로 COPanterio-posterior(COPap)와 COPmedial-lateral(COPml)의 궤적을 예측하였다. 머신러닝 모델(Neural Network(NN), Random Forest(RF), Support Vector Machine Regression(SVMR), k-Nearest Neighbors Regression(KNNR))을 통해 변수 선택 및 데 이터 증강 기법의 효과를 평가하였다. COPap 예측에서는 KNNR 모델의 Model III가 RMSE 11.6 mm, R2 0.97로 모든 모델 중 가 장 우수한 성능을 기록하였다. 데이터 증강과 변수 선택이 성능 향상에 효과적으로 기여한 것으로 나타났다. 반면, COPml 예측 에서는 KNNR 모델의 Model III가 RMSE 7.4 mm로 낮은 값을 기록하였으나, R2는 0.4으로 제한적인 성능을 보였다. 이는 COPml 데이터의 복잡성과 비선형적 특성으로 인해 FSR 센서만으로는 충분한 설명력이 부족했음을 시사한다. 본 연구는 제한된 수의 센서로도 COP 예측이 가능함을 입증하며, 데이터 증강과 변수 선택기 기법의 실효성을 제시하였다. 향후 연구에서는 다양한 보행 환경에서의 데이터 수집 및 FSR 센서 데이터의 활용도를 높이기 위한 비선형 모델링 접근을 포함한 추가 연구를 통해 예 측 성능을 개선하고 실시간 보행 분석 시스템으로 확장할 필요가 있다.","This study aims to predict the trajectory of the Center of Pressure (COP) during walking using a small number of pressure sensors and the impact of data preprocessing and augmentation techniques on prediction performance. Data were collected from nineFSR sensors selected from a commercially available pressure insole, and the trajectories of COPanterio-posterior (COPap) andCOPmedial-lateral (COPml) were predicted. The effects of variable selection and data augmentation techniques were evaluatedusing machine learning models, including Neural Network, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors Regression. For COPap prediction, the KNNR model’s Model III achieved the best performance with an RMSE of11.6 mm and an R² of 0.97, demonstrating the significant contribution of data augmentation and variable selection to performanceimprovement. In contrast, for COPml prediction, the KNNR model’s Model III recorded the lowest RMSE of 7.4 mm but showeda limited R² of 0.40. This suggests that the complexity and nonlinearity of COPml data were not sufficiently addressed using onlyFSR sensors. This study demonstrates the feasibility of COP prediction with a limited number of sensors and highlights the effectiveness of data augmentation and variable selection techniques. Future research should focus on collecting data in diverse walkingenvironments and improving prediction performance through nonlinear modeling approaches, ultimately aiming to expand towardreal-time gait analysis systems."
Hydrogen concentration prediction in a Passive Autocatalytic Recombiner using machine learning algorithms,2025,"['Passive autocatalytic recombiner', 'Hydrogen prediction', 'Machine learning models']",,"Monitoring hydrogen levels within Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) is crucial to mitigate potential risks during severe accidental scenarios. Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PARs), which operate passively through catalytic reactions, are installed in the containment to reduce hydrogen concentration. This study numerically investigates hydrogen behavior within PAR under various accident conditions. As the inlet temperature and hydrogen concentration increase, the reaction rate and maximum catalyst plate temperature rise. As the inflow velocity increases, the reaction amount rises, but the residence time for the reactions decreases, leading to an increase in the outlet hydrogen concentration. Leveraging the operational characteristics of the PAR, the present study develops a data-driven model to identify the correlations among the parameters associated with the PAR’s performance and to predict hydrogen concentration at the PAR’s outlet by adopting four machine learning algorithms: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), k-nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Using the PAR’s inlet variables of flow velocity, temperature, hydrogen concentration, and outlet temperature as input parameters, the ANN model demonstrates good predictive performance with R2 values of about 0.99. The predictive performance of the ANN model remains robust even without the inlet hydrogen information."

Traditional anomaly detection methods oftenfail to accurately model complex interactions within multidimensional and time-series sensor data, limitingtheir applicability in highly integrated manufacturing environments. This research proposes an advanced approachto address these critical limitations.Methods: An unsupervised GNN model was developed utilizing three months of actual sensor data from asemiconductor company's real-world CVD production line. The relationships between sensors were explicitlyrepresented through a graph structure, employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based embedding andattention mechanisms to effectively capture temporal dynamics and sensor interdependencies.

Future research should extend this promising methodology to diverse manufacturing contexts."
"Phenolic Compounds: Investigating Their Anti-Carbonic Anhydrase, Anti-Cholinesterase, Anticancer, Anticholinergic, and Antiepileptic Properties Through Molecular Docking, MM-GBSA, and Dynamics Analyses",2025,['Phenolic substance \xa0· Enzyme inhibition \xa0· Molecular docking \xa0· Anticancer \xa0· Molecular dynamic'],,"Phenolic compounds are a new class of Carbonic Anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs). Despite numerous advancements in treatment approaches, cancer continues to be a growing health problem worldwide. In our study, we tested the eff ects of 4-hydroxy3-methoxyacetophenone (1) , doxycycline hydrochloride (2) , 5,7-dichloro-8-hydroxyquinoline (3) , methyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate (4) , 2-hydroxy-4-methylacetophenone (5) , 6-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (6) , and 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone (7) on Achetylcholynesterase (AChE), Butrycholynesterase (BChE), and Human Carbonic anhydrase I (hCA I) enzymes. The U2OS human osteosarcoma cell line was used to determine the anticancer potential of these phenolic compounds. The eff ects of the compounds on proliferation and colony formation were analyzed using the Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) assay and the clonogenic assay. The K i values of arachidonoyl dopamine, 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzaldehyde, and 3,4-dihydroxy5-methoxybenzoic acid were 203.80, 1170.00, and 910.00 mM, respectively, for hCA I, and 75.25, 354.00, and 1510.00 mM, respectively, for Human Carbonic anhydrase II (hCA II). Additionally, IC 50 values from in vivo studies were found to range from 173.25 to 1360.00 mM for CA I and CA II, respectively, using CO 2 -hydratase activity methods. The NRU assay results revealed that the compounds had a dose-dependent cytotoxic eff ect on U2OS cells. The IC 50 values of the compounds in U2OS osteosarcoma cells were determined to be > 100, 93.7, 81.4, 26.9, > 100, 53.1, and > 100 μM, respectively. Notably, methyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate (4) , the compound with the lowest IC 50 value, signifi cantly suppressed colony formation at 5 and 10 μM concentrations. These results demonstrated that the phenolic compounds used in in vivo studies could inhibit approximately 30% of the CO2-hydratase activity of the total CA enzyme of rat erythrocytes. Furthermore, the anticancer potential of the tested compounds suggests that these molecules could pave the way for the development of new approaches in cancer treatment. The activities of the seven molecules studied were compared against AChE (PDB ID: 4M0E), BChE (PDB ID: 5NN0), hCA I (PDB ID: 2CAB), and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (PDB ID: 4HG7) proteins. The binding free energy of the molecule with the highest docking score is computed using MM/GBSA techniques. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations were performed between 6-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin and the 4M0E protein over a 0–200 ns interval."
