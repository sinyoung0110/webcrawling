태양광 발전 설비 고장 진단을 위한 머신러닝 모델 성능 평가 연구,2025,"['Confusion matrix', 'Digital O&amp', 'M', 'Fault diagnosis', 'Machine learning', 'Photovoltaic system']",,"This study proposes a methodology for performance evaluation of fault diagnosis in photovoltaic (PV) systems using machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Naive Bayes. Actual data were acquired from a 3kW PV testbed and categorized into eight classes representing normal and significant fault conditions. For each class, a confusion matrix and corresponding relevant metrics are utilized to conduct class-specific performance assessments. The results indicate that the Random Forest model outperforms other models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. It demonstrates outstanding performance for normal conditions (Class 0 and Class 7) and maintains stable performance for major fault types (Class 1 and Class 6). While the kNN model delivers acceptable performance for Class 0, it shows limitations for certain fault types. The Naive Bayes model exhibits the lowest performance and faces significant challenges in accurately handling most fault types."
데이터 특성에 따른 스태킹 모델의 유효성 연구,2025,"['Stacking model', 'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest', 'Naive Bayes', 'Logit', 'SVM']",,"Purpose  This study attempts to explore the performance of various stacking models by applying into two kinds of data, which have very different characteristic.Methods  The Base model includes decision tree, random forest, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, whereas support vector machine is adopted as the Meta model. Two kinds of data are ‘hmeq’ data and ‘bankrupt’ data. The performance is measured by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, false positive ratio, and false negative ratio.Results  For ‘hmeq’ data which are very well refined, random forest results super performance that all stacking models do not exceed. For ‘bankrupt’ data which are raw, containing much noise, stacking models perform, in overall, better than individual base models. Stacking model 5 outperforms, in particular.Conclusion  The empirical analysis results indicate that when data are highly refined and have a limited number of input variables, stacking approach seems not a good strategy. Choosing a highly hyperparameter-trainable model would be a good choice. On the other hand, when data are almost raw with many input variables, stacking can perform better than individual models by integrating individual model’s ability in reading underlying patterns."

Building a Chinese professional vocabulary database can relieve the language pressure of enterprise employees. Text classification technology is the prerequisite for building a vocabulary database. This study selected 650,000 words of professional texts in the field of energy power and materials under the classification of vocational education, extracted text features using the TF-IDF algorithm and the BOW bag-of-words model, and compared the accuracy (Precision), recall (Recall), and F1 index of the four algorithms of support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) in the classification of energy power and materials professional texts. The comparison shows that after using the BOW+SVM model framework to classify the ferrous metal material category text, the accuracy rate, recall rate and F1 index of 97.6%, 98.4% and 98% were obtained, which are better than other categories. The results show that the BOW+SVM model text classification framework is helpful for the construction of the energy power and materials professional vocabulary database, and combined with Chinese teaching to break the language barrier between English and Chinese for overseas employees of energy enterprises and promote the development of “Chinese+”."
해외 유명인 언급과 소셜 미디어를 통해 발생한 국내 대중의 비만치료제 관심도와 반응 분석,2025,"['obesity medication', 'Wegovy', 'social media', 'Google Trends', 'Naver Data Lab']",,"BACKGROUNDS Obesity is a growing public health concern, and anti-obesity medications have gained attention as a therapeutic alternative. Recently, public interest in drugs like Wegovy has surged, particularly influenced by celebrity mentions and social media trends. This study aims to explore how such external influences affect public awareness and sentiment toward anti-obesity medications in South Korea and the United States. METHODS We collected and analyzed data from Google Trends, Naver Data Lab, BigKinds news articles, and Naver Cafe posts. Keyword trend analysis, TFIDF weighting, and relationship mapping were conducted for news articles. Lexicon-based sentiment analysis and machine learning- based classification using Naive Bayes were applied to user-generated content. The data were preprocessed by removing special characters and performing morphological analysis. RESULTS After public mentions by celebrities such as Elon Musk, interest in Wegovy significantly increased, as observed in both search volume and online discussions. Sentiment analysis showed that most reactions were negative, primarily due to concerns about side effects and high cost. The machine learning model classified emotional tone more precisely compared to lexicon-based analysis. CONCLUSION Celebrity influence and social media exposure appear to correlate with increased interest in anti-obesity drugs. This study provides a foundational reference for public health communication strategies, while highlighting the need for policy considerations around the uncritical spread of medical information online."
Blockchain-based system for User Consent Management using Smart Contract in Healthcare,2025,"['블록체인', '헬스케어', '스마트 컨트랙트', '사용자콘센트', '데이터 관리', 'Blockchain', 'Healthcare', 'Smart contract', 'User   consent', 'Data management']",,"The integration of blockchain technology in healthcare has, over the years, developed into a solution that addresses security, transparency, and patient autonomy in the management of their own data. This paper presents a blockchain-based framework for managing user consent and leveraging smart contracts to enable decentralized, immutable, and transparent processing of patient data. Our system empowers users by giving them control over their own data while respecting the terms and conditions of the contract between the patient and the medical institution or hospital. By employing classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes for managing terms and verifying user consent conditions, this approach ensures safety and operational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and robustness of the framework, offering a promising way forward for modernizing healthcare data management."

Prediction of Hemifacial Spasm Re-Appearing Phenomenon after Microvascular Decompression Surgery in Patients with Hemifacial Spasm Using Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging,2025,['Magnetic resonance imaging · Hemifacial spasm · Microvascular decompression surgery · Reappearing symptom · Extraction fraction'],,"Objective : Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is treated by a surgical procedure called microvascular decompression (MVD). However, HFS reappearing phenomenon after surgery, presenting as early recurrence, is experienced by some patients after MVD. Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and two analytical methods : receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and machine learning, were used to predict early recurrence in this study.Methods : This study enrolled 60 patients who underwent MVD for HFS. They were divided into two groups : group A consisted of 32 patients who had early recurrence and group B consisted of 28 patients who had no early recurrence of HFS. DSC perfusion MRI was undergone by all patients before the surgery to obtain the several parameters. ROC curve and machine learning methods were used to predict early recurrence using these parameters.Results : Group A had significantly lower relative cerebral blood flow than group B in most of the selected brain regions, as shown by the region-of-interest-based analysis. By combining three extraction fraction (EF) values at middle temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and brainstem, with age, using naive Bayes machine learning method, the best prediction model for early recurrence was obtained. This model had an area under the curve value of 0.845.Conclusion : By combining EF values with age or sex using machine learning methods, DSC perfusion MRI can be used to predict early recurrence before MVD surgery. This may help neurosurgeons to identify patients who are at risk of HFS recurrence and provide appropriate postoperative care."
