Does deep learning-based colposcopy image analysis predict high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) better than cervical cytology or HPV test?,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: Recently, many studies have been conducted on colposcopy image analysis based on deep learning. The classification accuracy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia using deep learning has been reported to be about 60-80%. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether deep learning based colposcopy image reading could be a stronger predictor for HSIL compared to other clinical factors.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 987 patients who underwent colposcopy from 2017 to 2019 at Jeju national university hospital. The patients with missing cytology or HPV test were excluded. Adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma were excluded due to their small numbers. The probability that colposcopy image is HSIL was calculated by the deep learning model trained on 20,000 photos which we had made in our previous study. To identify the predictors of pathologically confirmed HSIL, univariate analyses were performed using chi-square test or Fishers exact test. To explore the relative contributions of the various factors, multivariate logistic regression analysis including cervical cytology, HPV test, and calculated HSIL probability by deep learning model was conduct.Results: A total of 892 patients were analyzed. 89% of patients had cervical cytology results with ASCUS or worse. The patients with positive HPV test was 75%. The patients who underwent punch biopsy and Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) were 59% and 25%, respectively. For every 1% increase in the HSIL probability predicted by deep learning, the odds of HSIL increase by 2.4%. Independent predictors of HSIL on multivariate logistic regression were HSIL or ASC-H cytology (OR = 10.95), positive HPV (OR = 5.44), and HSIL on colposcopy image classification by deep learning (OR = 2.16): all P < 0.05.Conclusion: Although HSIL prediction through deep learning of colposcopy images achieved statistical significance, it is not robust compared to cervical cytology or HPV test."
Applicability of Deep Learning Network on Gray Mold Disease Detection on Strawberry Leaves,2022,"['Botrytis cinerea', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Strawberry']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Early and accurate disease detection in the plant is crucial to mitigate its effect and maximize the yield. Gray mold is considered the most devastating strawberry disease, leading to complete plant death. Various machine learning and deep learning-based models were developed in the past. However, most studies used a controlled environment to capture the images and trained a model whose performance decreased when the models were tested images captured in the field. Therefore, there has been a need for a model that can detect and quantify plant disease accurately, especially in the natural environment. Therefore, this study developed an image segmentation model based on deep learning to distinguish the gray mold disease in strawberry plants. Three groups of strawberry plants (ten plants in each group) were inoculated with different concentrations of necrotrophic fungus pathogen (Botrytis cinerea) and observed the resulting disease. The deep learning model (Unet) was trained with images captured in a natural environment non-destructively. Model performance was assessed using evaluation metrics like intersection over union (IoU), pixel accuracy, and dice accuracy. Furthermore, two machine learning-based models (K-means and XGBoost) were also trained with the same images, and the performance of these models was compared. The deep learning-based model had an average IoU accuracy of 82.12%, dice accuracy of 89.71%, and pixel accuracy of 98.24%, surpassing both machine learning models in multiple aspects. The XGBoost model had an average IoU accuracy of 80.89%, dice accuracy of 85.40%, and pixel accuracy of 98.16%, which performed consistently well in identifying the disease following the deep learning-based model. In conclusion, the developed model could be a valuable tool for strawberry farmers with a simple computational setup in gray mold disease detection."

Deep Learning 기반의 폐기물 선별 Vision 시스템 개발,2022,"['Deep Learning', 'Detection', 'Robot', 'Vision', 'Waste']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recently, with the development of industry and the improvement of living standards, various wastes are generated along with the production of various products. Most of these wastes are used as containers for products, and plastic or aluminum is used. Various attempts are being made to automate the classification of these wastes due to the high labor cost, but most of them are solved by manpower due to the geometrical shape change due to the nature of the waste. In this study, in order to automate the waste sorting task, Deep Learning technology is applied to a robot system for waste sorting and a vision system for waste sorting to effectively perform sorting tasks according to the shape of waste. As a result of the experiment, a Deep Learning parameter suitable for waste sorting was selected. In addition, through various experiments, it was confirmed that 99% of wastes could be selected in individual & group image learning. It is expected that this will enable automation of the waste sorting operation."
Profane or Not: Improving Korean Profane Detection using Deep Learning,2022,"['Profanity', 'deep learning', 'convolutional neural network', 'text mining', 'natural language processing']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Abusive behaviors have become a common issue in many online social media platforms. Profanity is common form of abusive behavior in online. Social media platforms operate the filtering system using popular profanity words lists, but this method has drawbacks that it can be bypassed using an altered form and it can detect normal sentences as profanity. Especially in Korean language, the syllable is composed of graphemes and words are composed of multiple syllables, it can be decomposed into graphemes without impairing the transmission of meaning, and the form of a profane word can be seen as a different meaning in a sentence. This work focuses on the problem of filtering system mis-detecting normal phrases with profane phrases. For that, we proposed the deep learning-based framework including grapheme and syllable separation-based word embedding and appropriate CNN structure. The proposed model was evaluated on the chatting contents from the one of the famous online games in South Korea and generated 90.4% accuracy."

Defect Diagnosis and Classification of Machine Parts Based on Deep Learning,2022,"['Machinery Parts', 'Defect of Welding', 'Circular Plug', 'Electro Galvanized Nuts', 'Deep Neural Network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The automatic defect sorting function of machinery parts is being introduced to the automation of the manufacturing process. In the final stage of automation of the manufacturing process, it is necessary to apply computer vision rather than human visual judgment to determine whether there is a defect. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning method to improve the classification performance of typical mechanical parts, such as welding parts, galvanized round plugs, and electro galvanized nuts, based on the results of experiments. In the case of poor welding, the method to further increase the depth of layer of the basic deep learning model was effective, and in the case of a circular plug, the surrounding data outside the defective target area affected it, so it could be solved through an appropriate pre-processing technique. Finally, in the case of a nut plated with zinc, since it receives data from multiple cameras due to its three-dimensional structure, it is greatly affected by lighting and has a problem in that it also affects the background image. To solve this problem, methods such as two-dimensional connectivity were applied in the object segmentation preprocessing process. Although the experiments suggested that the proposed methods are effective, most of the provided good/defective images data sets are relatively small, which may cause a learning balance problem of the deep learning model, so we plan to secure more data in the future."

Unlike previous studies, that foucsed on the disparity between men and women sports on the media, this study looked at the disparity in women’s games. We hypothesized that the media represents bodies of female players differently depending upon their physical attractiveness, sexuality and not their atheletism. Particularly, this distinction is made by more covert and clandestine media practices.  We examined three highlights of the 2020 Phantom Classic KLPGA competition using key frame extraction and deep learning approaches for object detection. As a consequence, we discovered that 1) one of the differences between the highlighted images of female players is sexuality. The female player who was popular with body shape had upper body graphics that were up to 2.5 times longer than the the competition winner. In addition, the size of visual screen image was greater than the winner's. Although the findings of this study are limited to three highlights from a single tournament, the implications are strong enough to suggest that more covert and clandestine media techniques are being used to emphasize the sexuality of female players, and that deep learning can be used to distinguish visual images from broadcasting sports channels."

Unfortunately, the conventional approach employed by IEEE 802.11 wireless networks is not scalable enough to sustain consistent performance for the increasing number of stations. Yet, it is still the default when accessing channels for single-users of 802.11 transmissions. Recently, there has been a spike in attempts to enhance network performance using a machine learning (ML) technique known as reinforcement learning (RL). Its advantage is interacting with the surrounding environment and making decisions based on its own experience. Deep RL (DRL) uses deep neural networks (DNN) to deal with more complex environments (such as continuous state spaces or actions spaces) and to get optimum rewards. As a result, we present a new approach of CW control mechanism, which is termed as contention window threshold (CW<sub>Threshold</sub>). It uses the DRL principle to define the threshold value and learn optimal settings under various network scenarios. We demonstrate our proposed method, known as a smart exponential-threshold-linear backoff algorithm with a deep Q-learning network (SETL-DQN). The simulation results show that our proposed SETL-DQN algorithm can effectively improve the throughput and reduce the collision rates."

Deep-learning segmentation of ultrasound images for automated calculation of the hydronephrosis area to renal parenchyma ratio,2022,"['Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract', 'Deep learning', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Ultrasonography']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: We investigated the feasibility of measuring the hydronephrosis area to renal parenchyma (HARP) ratio from ultrasound images using a deep-learning network.Materials and Methods: The coronal renal ultrasound images of 195 pediatric and adolescent patients who underwent pyeloplasty to repair ureteropelvic junction obstruction were retrospectively reviewed. After excluding cases without a representative longitudinal renal image, we used a dataset of 168 images for deep-learning segmentation. Ten novel networks, such as combinations of DeepLabV3+ and UNet++, were assessed for their ability to calculate hydronephrosis and kidney areas, and the ensemble method was applied for further improvement. By dividing the image set into four, cross-validation was conducted, and the segmentation performance of the deep-learning network was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and dice similarity coefficients by comparison with the manually traced area.Results: All 10 networks and ensemble methods showed good visual correlation with the manually traced kidney and hydronephrosis areas. The dice similarity coefficient of the 10-model ensemble was 0.9108 on average, and the best 5-model ensemble had a dice similarity coefficient of 0.9113 on average. We included patients with severe hydronephrosis who underwent renal ultrasonography at a single institution; thus, external validation of our algorithm in a heterogeneous ultrasonography examination setup with a diverse set of instruments is recommended.Conclusions: Deep-learning-based calculation of the HARP ratio is feasible and showed high accuracy for imaging of the severity of hydronephrosis using ultrasonography. This algorithm can help physicians make more accurate and reproducible diagnoses of hydronephrosis using ultrasonography."

After application of the denoising network, the same radiologists evaluated lesion detectability and image quality. For clinical application, a consensus on lesion type and localization on preoperative mammographic examinations of breast cancer patients was reached after discussion. Thereafter, coded low-dose, reconstructed full-dose, and full-dose images were presented and assessed in a random order.Results Lesions on 40% reconstructed full-dose images were better perceived when compared with low-dose images of mastectomy specimens as a reference. In clinical application, as compared to 40% reconstructed images, higher values were given on full-dose images for resolution (p < 0.001); diagnostic quality for calcifications (p < 0.001); and for masses, asymmetry, or architectural distortion (p = 0.037). The 40% reconstructed images showed comparable values to 100% full-dose images for overall quality (p = 0.547), lesion visibility (p = 0.120), and contrast (p = 0.083), without significant differences.Conclusion Effective denoising and image reconstruction processing techniques can enable breast cancer diagnosis with substantial radiation dose reduction."

A three-stage deep-learning-based method for crack detection of high-resolution steel box girder image,2022,"['crack detection', 'high-resolution image', 'steel box girder', 'three-stage method']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Crack detection plays an important role in the maintenance and protection of steel box girder of bridges. However, since the cracks only occupy an extremely small region of the high-resolution images captured from actual conditions, the existing methods cannot deal with this kind of image effectively. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a novel three-stage method based on deep learning technology and morphology operations. The training set and test set used in this paper are composed of 360 images (4928 × 3264 pixels) in steel girder box. The first stage of the proposed model converted highresolution images into sub-images by using patch-based method and located the region of cracks by CBAM ResNet-50 model. The <i>Recall</i> reaches 0.95 on the test set. The second stage of our method uses the Attention U-Net model to get the accurate geometric edges of cracks based on results in the first stage. The <i>IoU</i> of the segmentation model implemented in this stage attains 0.48. In the third stage of the model, we remove the wrong-predicted isolated points in the predicted results through dilate operation and outlier elimination algorithm. The <i>IoU</i> of test set ascends to 0.70 after this stage. Ablation experiments are conducted to optimize the parameters and further promote the accuracy of the proposed method. The result shows that: (1) the best patch size of sub-images is 1024 × 1024. (2) the CBAM ResNet-50 and the Attention U-Net achieved the best results in the first and the second stage, respectively. (3) Pre-training the model of the first two stages can improve the <i>IoU</i> by 2.9%. In general, our method is of great significance for crack detection."
Multicenter validation of a deep-learning-based pediatric early-warning system for prediction of deterioration events,2022,"['Cardiac arrest', 'critical care', 'deep learning', 'early warning score', 'pediatrics.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: Early recognition of deterioration events is crucial to improve clinical outcomes. For this purpose, we developed a deep-learning-based pediatric early-warning system (pDEWS) and aimed to validate its clinical performance. Methods: This is a retrospective multicenter cohort study including five tertiary-care academic children’s hospitals. All pediatric patients younger than 19 years admitted to the general ward from January 2019 to December 2019 were included. Using patient electronic medical records, we evaluated the clinical performance of the pDEWS for identifying deterioration events defined as in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) and unexpected general ward-to-pediatric intensive care unit transfer (UIT) within 24 hours before event occurrence. We also compared pDEWS performance to those of the modified pediatric early-warning score (PEWS) and prediction models using logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF).   Results: The study population consisted of 28,758 patients with 34 cases of IHCA and 291 cases of UIT. pDEWS showed better performance for predicting deterioration events with a larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, fewer false alarms, a lower mean alarm count per day, and a smaller number of cases needed to examine than the modified PEWS, LR, or RF models regardless of site, event occurrence time, age group, or sex. Conclusions: The pDEWS outperformed modified PEWS, LR, and RF models for early and accurate prediction of deterioration events regardless of clinical situation. This study demonstrated the potential of pDEWS as an efficient screening tool for efferent operation of rapid response teams."

The advent of deep learning or artificial intelligence (AI) technology involving convo- lutional neural networks has brought an unprecedented level of innovation to the field of organ segmentation. In addition, graphics processing units (GPUs) are utilized as boosters for both real-time Monte Carlo simulations and AI-based image segmentation applications. These ad- vancements provide the feasibility of creating three-dimensional (3D) geometric details of the human anatomy from tomographic imaging and performing Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations using increasingly fast and inexpensive computers. This review first introduces the history of three types of computational human phantoms: stylized medical internal radiation dosimetry (MIRD) phantoms, voxelized tomographic phantoms, and boundary representation (BREP) deformable phantoms. Then, the development of a person-specific phantom is demon- strated by introducing AI-based organ autosegmentation technology. Next, a new development in GPU-based Monte Carlo radiation dose calculations is introduced. Examples of applying computational phantoms and a new Monte Carlo code named ARCHER (Accelerated Radia- tion-transport Computations in Heterogeneous EnviRonments) to problems in radiation pro- tection, imaging, and radiotherapy are presented from research projects performed by students at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Finally, this review discusses challenges and future research opportunities. We found that, owing to the latest computer hardware and AI technology, computational human body models are moving closer to real human anatomy structures for accurate radiation dose calcula- tions."

Application of Deep Learning: A Review for Firefighting,2022,"['Deep Learning', 'Firefighting', 'Literature Review', 'Structural Fires']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the prevalence of Deep Learning in the literature on Fire & Rescue Service. It is found that deep learning techniques are only beginning to benefit the firefighters. The popular areas where deep learning techniques are making an impact are situational awareness, decision making, mental stress, injuries, well-being of the firefighter such as his sudden fall, inability to move and breathlessness, path planning by the firefighters while getting to an fire scene, wayfinding, tracking firefighters, firefighter physical fitness, employment, prediction of firefighter intervention, firefighter operations such as object recognition in smoky areas, firefighter efficacy, smart firefighting using edge computing, firefighting in teams, and firefighter clothing and safety. The techniques that were found applied in firefighting were Deep learning, Traditional K-Means clustering with engineered time and frequency domain features, Convolutional autoencoders, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Neural Networks, Simulation, VR, ANN, Deep Q Learning, Deep learning based on conditional generative adversarial networks, Decision Trees, Kalman Filters, Computational models, Partial Least Squares, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Edge computing, C5 Decision Tree, Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Reinforcement Learning, and Recurrent LSTM. The literature review is centered on Firefighters/firemen not involved in wildland fires. The focus was also not on the fire itself. It must also be noted that several deep learning techniques such as CNN were mostly used in fire behavior, fire imaging and identification as well. Those papers that deal with fire behavior were also not part of this literature review."
Deep Learning Applications in Perfusion MRI: Recent Advances and Current Challenges,2022,"['Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Neural network', 'Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI', 'Dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI', 'Arterial spin labeling']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Deep learning has shown its feasibility for applications in medical imaging. Deep learning- based methods are also rapidly being applied in a wide range of areas to replace traditional model-based methods, showing remarkable improvements in several MR image processing areas such as image reconstruction, image contrast conversion, and image quality improvement. With improvement of perfusion MRI techniques, various clinical applications have been also researched, which have improved tracer-kinetic modeling, and vice versa. Representatively, increased vascularity due to tumor angiogenesis, altered permeability due to blood-brain barrier breakdown, and quantifiable absolute cerebral blood perfusion can be imaged via perfusion MRI techniques. As a result, a large number of retrospective and prospective studies have proven that perfusion MRI can be used clinically to investigate various diseases (ranging from brain tumor, stroke, and migraine to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease) and various organs including brain, breast, prostate, and pancreas. However, tracer-kinetic model-based processing of parametric maps requires many physical assumptions, which is time-consuming with limitations in clinical applications. With current rapid development of deep learning technologies, the importance of the role of deep learning in MR imaging research appears to be increasing. Specifically for processing perfusion MRI, deep learning has its merit as an end-to-end model-free approach, resulting in markedly reduced processing time compared to conventional iterative methods thanks to its nearly instantaneous inference despite long training time. In this review, first, basic principles of MR physics in perfusion MRI are described. Recent progress and current challenges in both technical improvement and clinical applications of perfusion MRI using deep learning techniques are then summarized."
A Review on Advanced Methodologies to Identify the Breast Cancer Classification using the Deep Learning Techniques,2022,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'Deep Learning', 'Mammogram', 'Prediction', 'Automatic Analysis of Diagnostic Tests']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Breast cancer is among the cancers that may be healed as the disease diagnosed at early times before it is distributed through all the areas of the body. The Automatic Analysis of Diagnostic Tests (AAT) is an automated assistance for physicians that can deliver reliable findings to analyze the critically endangered diseases. Deep learning, a family of machine learning methods, has grown at an astonishing pace in recent years. It is used to search and render diagnoses in fields from banking to medicine to machine learning. We attempt to create a deep learning algorithm that can reliably diagnose the breast cancer in the mammogram. We want the algorithm to identify it as cancer, or this image is not cancer, allowing use of a full testing dataset of either strong clinical annotations in training data or the cancer status only, in which a few images of either cancers or noncancer were annotated. Even with this technique, the photographs would be annotated with the condition; an optional portion of the annotated image will then act as the mark. The final stage of the suggested system doesn't need any based labels to be accessible during model training. Furthermore, the results of the review process suggest that deep learning approaches have surpassed the extent of the level of state-of-of-the-the-the-art in tumor identification, feature extraction, and classification. in these three ways, the paper explains why learning algorithms were applied: train the network from scratch, transplanting certain deep learning concepts and constraints into a network, and (another way) reducing the amount of parameters in the trained nets, are two functions that help expand the scope of the networks. Researchers in economically developing countries have applied deep learning imaging devices to cancer detection; on the other hand, cancer chances have gone through the roof in Africa. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a sort of deep learning that can aid you with a variety of other activities, such as speech recognition, image recognition, and classification. To accomplish this goal in this article, we will use CNN to categorize and identify breast cancer photographs from the available databases from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

Control of Biological Wastewater Treatment (BWWT) is difficult because of the time-consuming, non-linearity nature of the process. Traditional modeling methods are incapable of capturing long-term multivariate dependencies of data for forecasting. To address such concerns, this study proposes a hybrid multi-stream deep learning architecture to estimate a hard-to-measure nitrite (NO2) concentration. As input data, comparatively easily measurable elements such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), suspended solids, and volumes are used. The features are trained a deep learning structure and NO2 Concentration is trained using a recurrent neural network. The proposed hybrid multi-stream architecture performed much better than other existing unimodal deep learning architecture in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and R²."

Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Fire Occurrence with Hydroclimatic Condition and Drought Phase over South Korea,2022,"['Climatic conditions', 'Drought', 'Human activity', 'Forest fire activities', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study evaluates the effects of climatic conditions and drought phase on occurrence frequency (OF) of forest fire in South Korea, and suggested a deep learning-based estimator for the occurrence frequency of fire. There was a high correlation between frequency and relative humidity (RH, R = -0.663) and wind speed (WS, R = 0.532). Using these correlations, we proposed a deep learning model that can estimate the OF. Among the three deep learning models (RH-WS-AMOF, RH-AMOF, and WS-AMOF) by combining RH and WS with average monthly OF (AMOF) during 1997 − 2019, the RH-WS-AMOF model showed the best performance. R2 and NSE were 0.838 and 0.828, respectively. The higher temperatures and drought lead to increase the potential for forest fire. Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index was introduced for exploring the link between meteorological drought and forest fire. We confirmed that SPEI can improve the performance of the DBN based on OF estimator in spring. The framework of this study can provide a predictive model for forest fire OF combined with a weather forecast model."

There are limits to detecting lanes in dynamic driving environments in conventional machine vision research, as the approaches are generally dependent on expert scenarios and fi ne-tuned heuristics.Deep learning has shown good performance in classifying target information with this distribution of nonlinear data; thus, many studies have actively applied deep learning to lane detection. However, most of these studies have focused on improving the accuracy, rather than on the operating speed. For the work reported herein, a benchmarking deep-learning framework for lane detection was applied with lightened feature extraction modules and decoder modules. These were used to compare performances and to present an indicator for selecting a model for optimizing real-time performance and accuracy. The VGG-16, MobileNet, and Shuffl eNet networks were used for the encoder module, whereas frontend dilation and UNet were used for the decoder module. The limitations of the benchmarking framework were analyzed, and perspective loss concepts were applied to the processing of the network using front-view images to ensure improvements in the accuracy and operating speed.

Deep learning-guided attenuation correction in the image domain for myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging,2022,"['SPECT', 'myocardial perfusion imaging', 'quantification', 'attenuation correction', 'deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We investigate the accuracy of direct attenuation correction (AC) in the image domain for myocardial perfusion SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) imaging (MPI-SPECT) using residual (ResNet) and UNet deep convolutional neural networks. MPI-SPECT 99mTc-sestamibi images of 99 patients were retrospectively included. UNet and ResNet networks were trained using non-attenuation-corrected SPECT images as input, whereas CT-based attenuation-corrected (CT-AC) SPECT images served as reference. Chang’s calculated AC approach considering a uniform attenuation coefficient within the body contour was also implemented. Clinical and quantitative evaluations of the proposed methods were performed considering SPECT CT-AC images of 19 subjects (external validation set) as reference. Image-derived metrics, including the voxel-wise mean error (ME), mean absolute error, relative error, structural similarity index (SSI), and peak signal-to-noise ratio, as well as clinical relevant indices, such as total perfusion deficit (TPD), were utilized. Overall, AC SPECT images generated using the deep learning networks exhibited good agreement with SPECT CT-AC images, substantially outperforming Chang’s method. The ResNet and UNet models resulted in an ME of −6.99 ± 16.72 and −4.41 ± 11.8 and an SSI of 0.99 ± 0.04 and 0.98 ± 0.05, respectively. Chang’s approach led to ME and SSI of 25.52 ± 33.98 and 0.93 ± 0.09, respectively.

Point-level deep learning approach for 3D acoustic source localization,2022,"['3D acoustic source localization', '3D spherical beamforming', 'deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Even though several deep learning-based methods have been applied in the field of acoustic source localization, the previous works have only been conducted using the two-dimensional representation of the beamforming maps, particularly with the planar array system. While the acoustic sources are more required to be localized in a spherical microphone array system considering that we live and hear in the 3D world, the conventional 2D equirectangular map of the spherical beamforming map is highly vulnerable to the distortion that occurs when the 3D map is projected to the 2D space. In this study, a 3D deep learning approach is proposed to fulfill accurate source localization via distortion-free 3D representation. A target function is first proposed to obtain 3D source distribution maps that can represent multiple sources’ positional and strength information. While the proposed target map expands the source localization task into a point-wise prediction task, a PointNet-based deep neural network is developed to precisely estimate the multiple sources’ positions and strength information. While the proposed model’s localization performance is evaluated, it is shown that the proposed method can achieve improved localization results from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives."

Using Image Deep Learning to Measure Flight Speeds and Patterns of Honeybees ( Apis mellifera) and Bumblebees ( Bombus terrestris) near Their Hives,2022,"['Flight pattern', 'Flight speed', 'Honeybee', 'Bumblebee', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Bee traffic at the hive entrance can be used as an important indicator of foraging activity. We investigated the flight speed and patterns of honeybees and bumblebees near their hives as a basis for calculating bee traffic using the image deep learning. The flying speed of bumblebees (0.48±0.36 m/s) near the hive was 1.4 times faster than that of honeybees (0.35±0.21 m/s).The flight speed of honeybee leaving the hive (0.54±0.33 m/s) was 1.7 times faster than that when entering the beehive (0.32±0.18 m/s). Distance from the hive and flight speed showed a positive correlation (honeybee r=0.600, bumblebee 0.659), and a significant linear regression model was derived (honeybee R2=0.516, bumblebee 0.433). The flight pattern near the hive differed significantly according to bee at entering and leaving the hive. Honeybees mainly showed flight that changed flight direction more than once (69.5%), whereas bumblebees mainly performed straight flight (48.7%) or had a single turn (36.5%) in flight. When bees entered the hive, honeybees primarily showed one-turn or two-turn flight patterns (88.5%), and bumblebees showed a one-turn flight pattern (48.0%). In contrast, when leaving the hive, honeybees primarily showed a straight flight pattern (63.0%), and bumblebees primarily showed a straight or one-turn pattern (90.5%). There was a significant difference in flight speed according to the flight pattern. The speed of straight flight (0.89±0.47 m/s) was 1.5 to 2.1 times faster than flight where direction changed. In summary, the speed and pattern of bees returning to or leaving the hive were different to from to the hive, and there were also differences between bee species.Therefore, our results can help determine the ideal frame rate for effectively capturing and recognizing the flying image of bees when calculating bee traffic by image deep learning."

A total of 193 asymptomatic subjects (86 nuns and 107 control subjects) received comprehensive health screening and underwent brain MRI scans. We compared cortical and sub-cortical volume between groups across multiple locations using our in-house U-Net++ deep learning-based automatic segmentation tool.Results Compared to the control group, the nun group displayed increased gray matter volume in the right lingual cortex, left isthmus-cingulate, posterior-cingulate, rostral-middle-frontal, superior-frontal, supramarginal, temporal-pole cortices, and bilateral pars-triangularis cortices after correction for multiple comparisons. On the other hand, the nun group showed reduced gray matter volume in the temporal and parietal regions relative to healthy controls.Conclusion Our study suggests that spiritual practice may affect brain structure, especially in several frontal regions involved in a higher level of insight function."
Porosity Evaluation of Additively Manufactured Components Using Deep Learning-based Ultrasonic Nondestructive Testing,2022,"['Additive manufacturing', 'Porosity', 'Ultrasonic nondestructive testing', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study proposed deep learning-based ultrasonic nondestructive testing for porosity evaluation of additively manufactured components. First, porosity mechanisms according to additive manufacturing (AM) processing conditions were studied using traditional scanning acoustic microscopy and optical microscopy. Second, correlations between ultrasonic properties and porosity content were analyzed. The correlation results showed that the increased porosity content resulted in a decreased ultrasonic velocity and increased ultrasonic attenuation coefficient. Third, various levels of porosities were evaluated using a deep learning model based on a fully connected deep neural network that was trained on raw ultrasonic signals measured in the AM samples. After training, the testing performance of the trained model was evaluated. Additionally, the generalization performance of the pre-trained model was assessed using newly fabricated AM samples that were not used for training. The results showed that the porosity content evaluated by the pre-trained model matched well with that measured via traditional scanning acoustic microscopy, thus demonstrating the feasibility of deep learning-based ultrasonic nondestructive testing for porosity evaluation of additively manufactured components."
Vibration-based structural health monitoring using CAE-aided unsupervised deep learning,2022,"['damage identification', 'on-site test', 'structural health monitoring', 'unsupervised deep learning', 'vibration assessment', 'BOTDA', 'bending stiffness', 'moment-curvature', 'prestressed high strength concrete', 'spun pile', 'tensile cracks']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM) is crucial for the dynamic maintenance of civil building structures to protect property security and the lives of the public. Analyzing these vibrations with modern artificial intelligence and deep learning (DL) methods is a new trend. This paper proposed an unsupervised deep learning method based on a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), which can overcome the limitations of conventional supervised deep learning. With the convolutional core applied to the DL network, the method can extract features self-adaptively and efficiently. The effectiveness of the method in detecting damage is then tested using a benchmark model. Thereafter, this method is used to detect damage and instant disaster events in a rubber bearing-isolated gymnasium structure. The results indicate that the method enables the CAE network to learn the intact vibrations, so as to distinguish between different damage states of the benchmark model, and the outcome meets the high-dimensional data distribution characteristics visualized by the t-SNE method. Besides, the CAE-based network trained with daily vibrations of the isolating layer in the gymnasium can precisely recover newly collected vibration and detect the occurrence of the ground motion. The proposed method is effective at identifying nonlinear variations in the dynamic responses and has the potential to be used for structural condition assessment and safety warning."
Bioimage Analyses Using Artificial Intelligence and Future Ecological Research and Education Prospects: A Case Study of the Cichlid Fishes from Lake Malawi Using Deep Learning,2022,"['Animal detection', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Citizenscience', 'Deep learning', 'Education', 'Machine learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Ecological research relies on the interpretation of large amounts of visual data obtained from extensive wildlife surveys, but such large-scale image interpretation is costly and time-consuming. Using an artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning model, especially convolution neural networks (CNN), it is possible to streamline these manual tasks on image information and to protect wildlife and record and predict behavior. Ecological research using deep-learning-based object recognition technology includes various research purposes such as identifying, detecting, and identifying species of wild animals, and identification of the location of poachers in real-time. These advances in the application of AI technology can enable efficient management of endangered wildlife, animal detection in various environments, and real-time analysis of image information collected by unmanned aerial vehicles. Furthermore, the need for school education and social use on biodiversity and environmental issues using AI is raised. School education and citizen science related to ecological activities using AI technology can enhance environmental awareness, and strengthen more knowledge and problem-solving skills in science and research processes. Under these prospects, in this paper, we compare the results of our early 2013 study, which automatically identified African cichlid fish species using photographic data of them, with the results of reanalysis by CNN deep learning method. By using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning frameworks, we achieve an accuracy of 82.54% and an F1-score of 0.77 with minimal programming and data preprocessing effort. This is a significant improvement over the previous our machine learning methods, which required heavy feature engineering costs and had 78% accuracy."
Development of Integrated Algorithm Based on Deep Learning and Stereo Vision Technology for Real Time Worker Tracking in Decommissioning Site,2022,"['Object detection', 'Object tracking', 'Stereo vision', 'Computer vision', 'Decommissioning site', 'YOLO', 'Deep sort']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"It is important to ensure worker’s safety from radiation hazard in decommissioning site. Real-time tracking of worker’s location is one of the factors necessary to detect radiation hazard in advance. In this study, the integrated algorithm for worker tracking has been developed to ensure the safety of workers. There are three essential techniques needed to track worker’s location, which are object detection, object tracking, and estimating location (stereo vision). Above all, object detection performance is most important factor in this study because the performance of tracking and estimating location is depended on worker detection level. YOLO (You Only Look Once version 5) model capable of real-time object detection was applied for worker detection. Among the various YOLO models, a model specialized for person detection was considered to maximize performance. This model showed good performance for distinguishing and detecting workers in various occlusion situations that are difficult to detect correctly. Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm which uses deep learning technique has been considered for object tracking. Deep SORT is an algorithm that supplements the existing SORT method by utilizing the appearance information based on deep learning. It showed good tracking performance in the various occlusion situations. The last step is to estimate worker’s location (x-y-z coordinates). The stereo vision technique has been considered to estimate location. It predicts xyz location using two images obtained from stereo camera like human eyes. Two images are obtained from stereo camera and these images are rectified based on camera calibration information in the integrated algorithm. And then workers are detected from the two rectified images and the Deep SORT tracks workers based on worker’s position and appearance between previous frames and current frames. Two points of workers having same ID in two rectified images give xzy information by calculating depth estimation of stereo vision. The integrated algorithm developed in this study showed sufficient possibility to track workers in real time. It also showed fast speed to enable real-time application, showing about 0.08 sec per two frames to detect workers on a laptop with high-performance GPU (RTX 3080 laptop version). Therefore, it is expected that this algorithm can be sufficiently used to track workers in real decommissioning site by performing additional parameter optimization."

Our dataset comprised breast mammogram images for 150 cases of malignant masses from which we extracted the mass ROI, and we composed a CNN-based deep learning model trained on this dataset to identify ROI mass lesions. The test dataset was created by shifting some of the training data images. Thus, although both datasets were different, they retained a deep structural similarity. We then applied our trained deep-learning model to detect masses on 8-bit mammogram images containing malignant masses. The input images were preprocessed by applying a scaling parameter of intensity before being used to train the CNN model for mass differentiation.Results: The highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.897 (Î 20).Conclusion: Our results indicated that the proposed patch-wise detection method can be utilized as a mass detection and segmentation tool."

The consequences of it can greatly affect the food security for an entire country. Due to force majeure, abnormal cases in climatic conditions, the annual incomes of many farmers and agricultural producers can be destroyed locally. Along with this, the rapid detection of plant diseases also remains difficult in many parts of the regions due to the lack of necessary infrastructure. In this case, it is possible to pave the way for the diagnosis of diseases with the help of the latest achievements due to the possibilities of feedback from the farmer - developer in the formation and updating of the database of sick and healthy plants with the help of advances in computer vision, developing on the basis of machine and deep learning.

This study proposes a deep learning-based personal mobility driver monitoring system that detects inattentive driving by classifying vibration data transmitted to the e-scooter when the driver fails to concentrate on driving. First, the N-back task technique is used. The driver was stimulated by external visual and auditory factors to generate a cognitive load, and vibration data were collected through a six-axis sensor. Second, the generated vibration data were pre-processed using short-time Fourier transform and wavelet transform (WT) and then converted into an image (spectrogram). Third, four multimodal convolutional neural networks such as LeNet-5, VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 were constructed and their performance was compared to find the best architecture. Experimental results show that multimodal DenseNet121 with WT can accurately classify safe, slightly anxious, and very anxious driving conditions.

In the proposed approach, by merging pixel-level and object-level information of multitemporal remote sensing images, we create the difference image (DI), and the frequency-domain significance technique is used to generate the DI saliency map. The fuzzy C-means clustering technique preclassifies the coarse change detection map by defining the DI saliency map threshold. We then extract the neighborhood features of the unchanged pixels and the changed (buildings) from pixel-level and object-level feature images, which are then used as valid deep neural network (DNN) training samples.

However, high cost and technical barriers limit the application of these tests, hindering optimal treatment. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been applied to predict molecular test results from digitized images of tissue slides. Furthermore, treatment response and prognosis can be predicted from tissue slides using DL. In this review, we summarized DL-based studies regarding the prediction of genetic mutation, microsatellite instability, tumor mutational burden, molecular subtypes, gene expression, treatment response, and prognosis directly from Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained tissue slides. Although performance needs to be improved, these studies clearly demonstrated the feasibility of DL-based prediction of key molecular features in cancer tissues.With the accumulation of data and technical advances, the performance of the DL system could be improved in the near future. Therefore, we expect that DL could provide cost- and time-effective alternative tools for patient stratification in the era of precision oncology."

According to the analysis result of the data from the capacitor, the component with twice the fundamental and switching frequencies demonstrated dominant characteristics. The most dominant low-frequency and mid-frequency components are extracted from the collected experimental voltage and current through a fast Fourier transform. With these four components, 11 combinations of input variables were created and used as inputs for the DNN. After training and testing, we determined which combination had the best performance. Therefore, in the case of capacitance, the use of a mid-frequency component together shows better performance than a low-frequency component alone. In the case of an equivalent series resistor, using both the mid-frequency capacitor voltage and the capacitor current component shows better performance than otherwise."

Structural reliability analysis using temporal deep learning-based model and importance sampling,2022,"['deep learning algorithm', 'numerical simulation', 'reliability analysis', 'stochastic processes', 'structural engineering']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The main idea of the framework is to seamlessly combine a reasonably accurate and fast surrogate model with the importance sampling strategy. Developing a surrogate model for predicting structures’ dynamic responses is challenging because it involves high-dimensional inputs and outputs. For this purpose, a novel surrogate model based on cutting-edge deep learning architectures specialized for capturing temporal relationships within time-series data, namely Long-Short term memory layer and Transformer layer, is designed. After being properly trained, the surrogate model could be utilized in place of the finite element method to evaluate structures’ responses without requiring any specialized software. On the other hand, the importance sampling is adopted to reduce the number of calculations required when computing the failure probability by drawing more relevant samples near critical areas. Thanks to the portability of the trained surrogate model, one can integrate the latter with the Importance sampling in a straightforward fashion, forming an efficient framework called TTIS, which represents double advantages: less number of calculations is needed, and the computational time of each calculation is significantly reduced. The proposed approach’s applicability and efficiency are demonstrated through three examples with increasing complexity, involving a 1D beam, a 2D frame, and a 3D building structure. The results show that compared to the conventional Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed method can provide highly similar reliability results with a reduction of up to four orders of magnitudes in time complexity."

A Deep Learning-based Depression Trend Analysis of Korean on Social Media,2022,"['topic modeling', 'deep learning', 'sentiment analysis', 'social media', '토픽 모델링', '딥러닝', '감성분석', '소셜미디어']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The number of depressed patients in Korea and around the world is rapidly increasing every year. However, most of the mentally ill patients are not aware that they are suffering from the disease, so adequate treatment is not being performed. If depressive symptoms are neglected, it can lead to suicide, anxiety, and other psychological problems. Therefore, early detection and treatment of depression are very important in improving mental health. To improve this problem, this study presented a deep learning-based depression tendency model using Korean social media text. After collecting data from Naver KonwledgeiN, Naver Blog, Hidoc, and Twitter, DSM-5 major depressive disorder diagnosis criteria were used to classify and annotate classes according to the number of depressive symptoms. Afterwards, TF-IDF analysis and simultaneous word analysis were performed to examine the characteristics of each class of the corpus constructed. In addition, word embedding, dictionary-based sentiment analysis, and LDA topic modeling were performed to generate a depression tendency classification model using various text features. Through this, the embedded text, sentiment score, and topic number for each document were calculated and used as text features. As a result, it was confirmed that the highest accuracy rate of 83.28% was achieved when the depression tendency was classified based on the KorBERT algorithm by combining both the emotional score and the topic of the document with the embedded text. This study establishes a classification model for Korean depression trends with improved performance using various text features, and detects potential depressive patients early among Korean online community users, enabling rapid treatment and prevention, thereby enabling the mental health of Korean society.

A Deep Learning-Based Compact Weighted Binary Classification Technique to Discriminate between Targets and Clutter in SAR Images,2022,"['Automatic Target Detection (ATD)', 'Deep Learning (DL)', 'Machine Learning (ML)', 'Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The proposed approach is a deep learning-based compact weighted binary classification (DL-CWBC) method to discriminate between targets and clutter in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. A new modified cross-entropy error function is proposed to improve the probability of detection by controlling the rate of false alarms (FAs). The unique feature of a CWBC algorithm is reducing the FA rate and maximizing the probability of target detection without missing any target. For pre-processing, targets and clutter are detected through a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) as a conventional detection algorithm. These are then manually divided into two classes. The classified targets and clutter were trained through a ResNet-101 network. There is a trade-off between the minimization of the FA rate and the maximization of the detection probability for targets of interest (TOIs). The weighted coefficient of the modified cross-entropy error function tries to maximize the performance of this trade-off. In addition, the proposed approach enables us not to miss any targets by an extreme distinction decision. Above all, the DL-CWBC algorithm performs very well despite its simplicity."

Feasibility of Deep Learning-Based Analysis of Auscultation for Screening Significant Stenosis of Native Arteriovenous Fistula for Hemodialysis Requiring Angioplasty,2022,"['Angioplasty', 'Deep learning', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Auscultation', 'Renal dialysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: To investigate the feasibility of using a deep learning-based analysis of auscultation data to predict significant stenosis of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) in patients undergoing hemodialysis requiring percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).Materials and Methods: Forty patients (24 male and 16 female; median age, 62.5 years) with dysfunctional native AVF were prospectively recruited. Digital sounds from the AVF shunt were recorded using a wireless electronic stethoscope before (pre-PTA) and after PTA (post-PTA), and the audio files were subsequently converted to mel spectrograms, which were used to construct various deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models (DenseNet201, EfficientNetB5, and ResNet50). The performance of these models for diagnosing ≥ 50% AVF stenosis was assessed and compared. The ground truth for the presence of ≥ 50% AVF stenosis was obtained using digital subtraction angiography. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to produce visual explanations for DCNN model decisions.Results: Eighty audio files were obtained from the 40 recruited patients and pooled for the study. Mel spectrograms of “pre-PTA” shunt sounds showed patterns corresponding to abnormal high-pitched bruits with systolic accentuation observed in patients with stenotic AVF. The ResNet50 and EfficientNetB5 models yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99 and 0.98, respectively, at optimized epochs for predicting ≥ 50% AVF stenosis. However, Grad- CAM heatmaps revealed that only ResNet50 highlighted areas relevant to AVF stenosis in the mel spectrogram.Conclusion: Mel spectrogram-based DCNN models, particularly ResNet50, successfully predicted the presence of significant AVF stenosis requiring PTA in this feasibility study and may potentially be used in AVF surveillance."

Seven different prediction models including three distinct multi-layered perceptrons (MLP), four different convolutional neural networks (CNN) were compared. Folded cross-validation was applied to train and evaluate model performance. The criteria for correct prediction were absolute error < 0.02 or relative error < 10%. The models were compared in terms of prediction accuracy, training time per epoch, training fluctuations, and required calculation resources.Results: The strength of MLP-based models was their fast initial convergence and short training time per epoch. They represented significantly different prediction accuracy depending on the model configuration. The CNN-based models showed relatively high prediction accuracy, low training fluctuations, and a relatively small increase in the memory requirement as the model deepens.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a CNN-based model with moderate depth would be appropriate when the prediction accuracy is important, and a shallow MLP-based model can be recommended when either the training resources or time are limited"

Meanwhile in Korea, heavy rain is one of the representative factors of natural disasters thatcause enormous economic damage and casualties every year. Accurate prediction of heavy rainfall over the Korean peninsula isvery difficult due to its geographical features, located between the Eurasian continent and the Pacific Ocean at mid-latitude, and theinfluence of the summer monsoon. In order to deal with such problems, the Korea Meteorological Administration operates variousstate-of-the-art observation equipment and a newly developed global atmospheric model system. Nevertheless, for precipitationnowcasting, the use of a separate system based on the extrapolation method is required due to the intrinsic characteristicsassociated with the operation of numerical weather prediction models. The predictability of existing precipitation nowcasting isreliable in the early stage of forecasting but decreases sharply as forecast lead time increases. At this point, AI technologies todeal with spatio-temporal features of data are expected to greatly contribute to overcoming the limitations of existing precipitationnowcasting systems. Thus, in this project the dataset required to develop, train, and verify deep learning-based precipitationnowcasting models has been constructed in a regularized form. The dataset not only provides various variables obtained frommultiple sources, but also coincides with each other in spatio-temporal specifications."
Impacts of label quality on performance of steel fatigue crack recognition using deep learning-based image segmentation,2022,"['crack recognition', 'deep learning', 'image segmentation', 'label quality']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Structural health monitoring (SHM) plays a vital role in the maintenance and operation of constructions. In recent years, autonomous inspection has received considerable attention because conventional monitoring methods are inefficient and expensive to some extent. To develop autonomous inspection, a potential approach of crack identification is needed to locate defects. Therefore, this study exploits two deep learning-based segmentation models, DeepLabv3+ and Mask R-CNN, for crack segmentation because these two segmentation models can outperform other similar models on public datasets. Additionally, impacts of label quality on model performance are explored to obtain an empirical guideline on the preparation of image datasets. The influence of image cropping and label refining are also investigated, and different strategies are applied to the dataset, resulting in six alternated datasets. By conducting experiments with these datasets, the highest mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), 75%, is achieved by Mask R-CNN. The rise in the percentage of annotations by image cropping improves model performance while the label refining has opposite effects on the two models. As the label refining results in fewer error annotations of cracks, this modification enhances the performance of DeepLabv3+. Instead, the performance of Mask R-CNN decreases because fragmented annotations may mistake an instance as multiple instances. To sum up, both DeepLabv3+ and Mask R-CNN are capable of crack identification, and an empirical guideline on the data preparation is presented to strengthen identification successfulness via image cropping and label refining."

Technologies associated with the monitoring of physical condition have successfully been applied in most aquafarm facilities; however, real-time biological monitoring systems that can observe fish condition and behaviour are still required. In this study, we used a video recorder placed on top of a fish tank to observe the swimming patterns of rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus), first one fish alone and then a group of five fish. Rock bream in the video samples were successfully identified using the you-only-look-once v3 algorithm, which is based on the Darknet-53 convolutional neural network. In addition to recordings of swimming behaviour under normal conditions, the swimming patterns of fish under abnormal conditions were recorded on adding an anaesthetic or lowering the salinity. The abnormal conditions led to changes in the velocity of movement (3.8 ± 0.6 cm/s) involving an initial rapid increase in speed (up to 16.5 ± 3.0 cm/s, upon 2-phenoxyethanol treatment) before the fish stopped moving, as well as changing from swimming upright to dying lying on their sides. Machine learning was applied to datasets consisting of normal or abnormal behaviour patterns, to evaluate the fish behaviour. The proposed algorithm showed a high accuracy (98.1%) in discriminating normal and abnormal rock bream behaviour. We conclude that artificial intelligence-based detection of abnormal behaviour can be applied to develop an automatic bio-management system for use in the aquaculture industry."

Live load surveys are traditionally conducted by randomly selecting rooms and weighing each item on-site, a method that has problems of low efficiency, high cost, and long cycle time. This paper proposes a deep learning-based method combined with Internet big data to perform live load surveys. The proposed survey method utilizes multi-source heterogeneous data, such as images, voice, and product identification, to obtain the live load without weighing each item through object detection, web crawler, and speech recognition. The indoor objects and face detection models are first developed based on fine-tuning the YOLOv3 algorithm to detect target objects and obtain the number of people in a room, respectively. Each detection model is evaluated using the independent testing set. Then web crawler frameworks with keyword and image retrieval are established to extract the weight information of detected objects from Internet big data. The live load in a room is derived by combining the weight and number of items and people. To verify the feasibility of the proposed survey method, a live load survey is carried out for a meeting room. The results show that, compared with the traditional method of sampling and weighing, the proposed method could perform efficient and convenient live load surveys and represents a new load research paradigm."

In this study, we used deep learning to analyze simple uroflowmetry.Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 4,835 male patients aged ≥40 years who underwent a urodynamic study at a single center. We excluded patients with a disease or a history of surgery that could affect LUTS. A total of 1,792 patients were included in the study. We extracted a simple uroflowmetry graph automatically using the ABBYY Flexicapture® image capture program (ABBYY, Moscow, Russia). We applied a convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep learning method to predict DUA and BOO. A 5-fold cross-validation average value of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was chosen as an evaluation metric. When it comes to binary classification, this metric provides a richer measure of classification performance. Additionally, we provided the corresponding average precision-recall (PR) curves.Results: Among the 1,792 patients, 482 (26.90%) had BOO, and 893 (49.83%) had DUA. The average AUROC scores of DUA and BOO, which were measured using 5-fold cross-validation, were 73.30% (mean average precision [mAP]=0.70) and 72.23% (mAP=0.45), respectively.Conclusions: Our study suggests that it is possible to differentiate DUA from non-DUA and BOO from non-BOO using a simple uroflowmetry graph with a fine-tuned VGG16, which is a well-known CNN model."

To meet these requirements of the livestock industry, smart livestock technology is being developed and propagated. Recently, many studies have been conducted to obtain information on the health and physiological status of livestock by applying image processing- and artificial intelligence-based technology. In particular, because changes in pig behavior patterns can provide considerable information about their health and physiological status, this study proposes a method to classify pig behavior patterns from images of a pig kennel by applying a deep learning-based instance segmentation model. For this purpose, we first constructed a Pig Motion dataset by building a robot operation system (ROS)-based data collection system that could synchronize and collect voice and climate information along with pig motion images in time. This dataset was organized by classifying four types of pig behavior, namely, lying, standing, sitting, and eating, into motion classes. By learning this dataset using the instance segmentation model, an object is extracted from the pig’s motion characteristic information to create a model that divides and classifies it. We propose a behavioral pattern classification model that can be used to estimate the health and physiological state of pigs by classifying their behavioral patterns from streaming videos and accumulated data and statisticalizing them."

Reconstruction of old well log data using deep learning imputation,2022,"['imputation', 'time-series', 'deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Well logs are important datasets for interpreting subsurface geology because they represent the physical properties of the logged formations. However, at certain intervals, such information may be missing and/or incorrect due to drilling issues (e.g., significantly larger mud weight than formation integrity, resulting in formation damage), an inefficient logging process, or tool operational concerns. In the case of logging tool faults, such flaws are often identified by the existence of abnormal data spikes or erroneously low log readings in the damaged formation. To solve this issue, a new deep learning-based system was tested to imputate such missing values for sonic log (DT) data. The missing well log values were predicted using data-driven machine learning methods, specifically the GRU and LSTM, given time step sequence inputs from a window. To establish the ideal parameters for achieving the best validation score, an empirical research technique was used. Throughout the training phase, the relative value of various input parameters was analyzed in order to eliminate insensitive measurements and prioritize data with a high connection to the target variables.

Efficient dead pine tree detecting method in the Forest damaged by pine wood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) through utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles and deep learning-based object detection techniques,2022,"['Pine wilt disease', 'forest disease monitoring', 'drone', 'aerial image', 'digital surface model', 'computer vision']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Pine wood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) is an invasive pathogen in South Korea, where it has caused pine wilt disease (PWD) with extremely high mortality of native pine species (Pinus densiflora, Pinus thunbergii, and Pinus koraiensis). Since the disease spreads by its vectors, native pine sawyer beetles (Monochamus alternatus and Monochamus saltuarius), the cost of monitoring the expansion has been rapidly increasing. Furthermore, it is even more costly to eliminate new and isolated infections since unremoved infected trees act as new sources of infection through the preferred oviposition of the beetles on such trees. The methodology of combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and object detection based on deep learning provides the opportunity to solve such problems, as UAV with RGB camera can provide high spatial resolution aerial image and digital surface model (DSM), which can be used for object detection with excellent results. In this study, we evaluated the perform- ance of this method to detect dead pine trees in PWD-damaged areas. In particular, to ensure low omission error of monitoring, YOLOv3 was employed for object detection as the model design is focused on minimizing the omission error. We also modified the model so that the positions and crown diameter could be estimated. Four detection models were trained using four different combinations between aerial images (R, G, B) and DSM from UAV. Among them, the model from RGB showed the highest performance (recall: 0.9909, precision: 0.8438) and was selected as the optimal model. Our results suggest that our method can contribute to low-cost and effective monitoring of the dead pine trees while maintaining low omission error, which is critical for PWD management."

Due to the backscattering characteristics of SAR, speckle is distributed in the image, making it difficult to analyze. This paper investigates the classically used unsupervised method of SAR image segmentation that can easily recognize and analyze SAR images and the recently used deep learning algorithm, and compare the accuracy using performance metrics. Although the method using deep learning has the problem of insufficient dataset, it improves performance by 10-20% compared to unsupervised. Also, among deep learning algorithms, how the algorithms used in Electro Optical / Infrared (EO / IR) are used in SAR images and problems are investigated. In a recent study, the SAR image considered as a visible light image and applied it to a deep learning algorithm using eo to obtain results. In the future, more benchmark datasets for SAR images should be built, and research on deep learning algorithms using SAR data information will be conducted."
Prediction of Water Quantity and Quality Variables Using Deep Learning Algorithms Adopted in Time Series Domain,2022,"['Deep learning', 'Time series data', 'Water quality', 'Water quantity', 'Sequential prediction model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We developed sequential deep learning models to predict time-series water quantity and quality data. The data set consisting of 10 input variables was prepared from a watershed model Hydrological Simulation Program - FORTRAN (HSPF) fine-tuned to existing conditions in the Nam River Basin on a daily time step for the simulation period 2019-2021. The whole data set was partitioned into training and test sets in the ratio 7 to 3. The predictive accuracy of four deep learning models, created differently in terms of the types of algorithms as well as the number of layers, was tested with respect to mean squared error (MSE). We found that changes in input time steps from 1 to 2 days led to a sharp reduction in prediction errors of all applied models for two target variables during the training and test phases, except for a few cases. In addition, at least 3 important variables were enough to maintain the predictive accuracy of the original deep learning model with 10 variables. The performance of the deep learning model was sensitive to output time steps rather than input time steps. In all test conditions, the MSE values were extremely low, reaching as high as 0.0056. Therefore, sequential deep learning models, regardless of their types and architectures, are most suitable for predictive modeling of time series data compiled on a daily basis or less such as remote sensing data in hydrology and agriculture."

Considering numerous mechanical repetitive tasks, reading image slices need time and improper with geographical limits, so the counting of image information is hard due to its strong subjectivity that raise the error ratio in misdiagnosis. Regarding the highest mortality rate of Lung cancer, there is a need for biopsy for determining its class for additional treatment. Deep learning has recently given strong tools in diagnose of lung cancer and making therapeutic regimen. However, identifying the pathological lung cancer's class by CT images in beginning phase because of the absence of powerful AI models and public training data set is difficult. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was proposed with its essential function in recognizing the pathological CT images. 472 patients subjected to staging FDG-PET/CT were selected in 2 months prior to surgery or biopsy. CNN was developed and showed the accuracy of 87%, 69%, and 69% in training, validation, and test sets, respectively, for T1-T2 and T3-T4 lung cancer classification. Subsequently, CNN (or deep learning) could improve the CT images' data set, indicating that the application of classifiers is adequate to accomplish better exactness in distinguishing pathological CT images that performs better than few deep learning models, such as ResNet-34, Alex Net, and Dense Net with or without Soft max weights."
Deep learning approach for classification of  chondrocytes in rats,2022,"['rats', 'chondrocytes', 'digital pathology', 'classification', 'deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The rapid development of computer vision and deep learning has enabled these technologies to be applied to the automated classification and counting of microscope images, thereby relieving of some burden from pathologists in terms of performing tedious microscopic examination for analysis of a large number of slides for pathological lesions. Recently, the use of these digital methods has expanded into the field of medical image analysis. In this study, the Inception-v3 deep learning model was used for classification of chondrocytes from knee joints of rats. Knee joints were extracted, fixed in neutral buffered formalin, decalcified, processed and embedded in paraffin, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained. The H&E stained slides were converted into whole slide imaging (WSI), and the images were cropped to 79 × 79 pixels. The images were divided into training (60.42%) and test (39.58%) sets (46,349 and 30,360 images, respectively). Then, images containing chondrocytes were classified by Inception-v3 and accuracy was calculated. We visualized the images containing chondrocytes in WSIs by adding colored dots to patches. When images of chondrocytes in knee joints were evaluated, the accuracy was within the range of 91.20 ± 8.43%. Therefore, it is considered that the Inception-v3 deep learning model was able to distinguish chondrocytes from non-chondrocytes in knee joints of rats with a relatively high accuracy. The above results taken together confirmed that this deep learning model could classify the chondrocytes and this promising approach will provide pathologists a fast and accurate analysis of diverse tissue structures."

However, VFSS interpretation is complex and requires consideration of several factors. Therefore, considering the expected impact on dysphagia management, this study aimed to apply deep learning to detect the presence of penetration or aspiration in VFSS of patients with dysphagia automatically.Methods: The VFSS data of 190 participants with dysphagia were collected. A total of 10 frame images from one swallowing process were selected (five high-peak images and five low-peak images) for the application of deep learning in a VFSS video of a patient with dysphagia. We applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) for deep learning using the Python programming language. For the classification of VFSS findings (normal swallowing, penetration, and aspiration), the classification was determined in both high-peak and lowpeak images. Thereafter, the two classifications determined through high-peak and low-peak images were integrated into a final classification.Results: The area under the curve (AUC) for the validation dataset of the VFSS image for the CNN model was 0.942 for normal findings, 0.878 for penetration, and 1.000 for aspiration.The macro average AUC was 0.940 and micro average AUC was 0.961.Conclusion: This study demonstrated that deep learning algorithms, particularly the CNN, could be applied for detecting the presence of penetration and aspiration in VFSS of patients with dysphagia."
K-Means Clustering with Deep Learning for Fingerprint Class Type Prediction,2022,"['Clustering', 'Deep learning', 'Fingerprint classification', 'Transfer learning', 'Prediction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In deep learning classification tasks, most models frequently assume that all labels are available for the training datasets. As such strategies to learn new concepts from unlabeled datasets are scarce. In fingerprint classification tasks, most of the fingerprint datasets are labelled using the subject/individual and fingerprint datasets labelled with finger type classes are scarce. In this paper, authors have developed approaches of classifying fingerprint images using the majorly known fingerprint classes. Our study provides a flexible method to learn new classes of fingerprints. Our classifier model combines both the clustering technique and use of deep learning to cluster and hence label the fingerprint images into appropriate classes. The K means clustering strategy explores the label uncertainty and high-density regions from unlabeled data to be clustered. Using similarity index, five clusters are created. Deep learning is then used to train a model using a publicly known fingerprint dataset with known finger class types. A prediction technique is then employed to predict the classes of the clusters from the trained model. Our proposed model is better and has less computational costs in learning new classes and hence significantly saving on labelling costs of fingerprint images."

Based on the previous studies on subjecthood diagnostics in Korean, this paper examined the two subjecthood diagnostics: Honorific Agreement (HA) and Plural Copying (PC). For the experimental analysis, this study adopted the analysis results of Kim et al. (2017). For the deep learning analysis, this paper employed the KR-BERT for the deep learning model and three sources of data sets: the Korean version of the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (K-CoLA), the Sejong Morphologically-Analyzed Corpus, and the extended target sentences of Kim et al. (2017). Two separate experiments were conducted in the deep learning analysis. In the first experiment, the KR-BERT was trained only with the K-CoLA, and the target sentences were analyzed. In the second experiment, the KR-BERT was trained with the K-CoLA and the sentences from the Sejong corpus, and the acceptability scores of the target sentences were measured. The acceptability scores were measured with the numeric scores using the algorithms in Lee (2021). After the experiments with the deep learning models, the scores were normalized and were statistically analyzed with Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Through the two experiments, the following fact was observed: both HA and PC did not show similar tendencies of experimental results with human participants in the first experiment, but they did in the second experiment. The analysis results demonstrated that both HA and PC could be used as subjecthood diagnostics but that they played significant roles only when native speakers were exposed to enough examples."

To this end, in the conventional system, a flood image of the scintillation pixel is obtained, the imaged area of each scintillation pixel is separated, and the position of the scintillation pixel is specified and acquired as a digital signal. In this study, a deep learning method was applied based on the signal formed by the photosensor of the detector, and a method was developed to directly acquire a digital signal without going through various procedures.

To increase the accuracy of the DL model, more parameters are used. Therefore, the current DL models are black-box models that cannot understand the internal structure. This is the reason why the DL model cannot be applied to fields where stability and reliability are important despite its high performance. In this paper, We investigated various Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to solve this problem. We also investigated what approaches exist to make multi-modal deep learning models transparent."

Positive and negative cases were defined according to whethervertebral fractures developed during follow-up. The cases were divided into training (n=1,416) and test (n=179) sets. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based prediction algorithm, DeepSurv, was trained with images and baseline clinical information (age,sex, body mass index, glucocorticoid use, and secondary osteoporosis). The concordance index (C-index) was used to compare performance between DeepSurv and the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and Cox proportional hazard (CoxPH) models.Results: Of the total participants, 1,188 (74.4%) were women, and the mean age was 60.5 years. During a mean follow-up period of40.7 months, vertebral fractures occurred in 7.5% (120/1,595) of participants. In the test set, when DeepSurv learned with imagesand clinical features, it showed higher performance than FRAX and CoxPH in terms of C-index values (DeepSurv, 0.612; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.571 to 0.653; FRAX, 0.547; CoxPH, 0.594; 95% CI, 0.552 to 0.555). Notably, the DeepSurv method withoutclinical features had a higher C-index (0.614; 95% CI, 0.572 to 0.656) than that of FRAX in women.Conclusion: DeepSurv, a CNN-based prediction algorithm using baseline image and clinical information, outperformed the FRAXand CoxPH models in predicting osteoporotic fracture from spine radiographs in a longitudinal cohort."

A Pixel-based Encryption Method for Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning Models,2022,"['privacy-preserving deep learning', 'chaos theory', 'CIFAR datasets', 'perceptual encryption algorithms']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In the recent years, pixel-based perceptual algorithms have been successfully applied for privacy-preserving deep learning (DL) based applications. However, their security has been broken in subsequent works by demonstrating a chosen-plaintext attack. In this paper, we propose an efficient pixel-based perceptual encryption method. The method provides a necessary level of security while preserving the intrinsic properties of the original image. Thereby, can enable deep learning (DL) applications in the encryption domain. The method is substitution based where pixel values are XORed with a sequence (as opposed to a single value used in the existing methods) generated by a chaotic map. We have used logistic maps for their low computational requirements. In addition, to compensate for any inefficiency because of the logistic maps, we use a second key to shuffle the sequence. We have compared the proposed method in terms of encryption efficiency and classification accuracy of the DL models on them. We have validated the proposed method with CIFAR datasets. The analysis shows that when classification is performed on the cipher images, the model preserves accuracy of the existing methods while provides better security."
Lexical Effects in Island Constraints: A Deep Learning Approach,2022,"['island constraints', 'lexical effects', 'deep learning', 'BERTLARGE', 'mixed-effects model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper examined the lexical effects (a kind of random effect) of each experimental item in English island constraints. For this purpose, this paper adopted (i) the experimental design and dataset in Lee and Park (2018) and (ii) the deep learning model (the BERTLARGE model) in Lee (2021). After the BERTLARGE model was pretrained with the CoLA dataset, the acceptability scores were calculated for all the sentences in the dataset. As in Lee (2021), the acceptability scores in the BERTLARGE model were measured with the numerical values (neither TRUE/FALSE nor Likert scale), which was similar to the magnitude estimation in experimental syntax. After all the acceptability scores were collected, they were normalized into the z-scores and statistically analyzed. In this paper, a mixed-effects model was used where both fixed and random effects could be analyzed, but this paper focused on the random effects which were related to the lexicalization of experimental items. Through the analysis, the following was observed: (i) deep learning models could provide some help to make the experimental designs of syntax more sophisticated and fine-grained, (ii) it was possible to examine and control the lexical effects of experimental items with a deep learning model and a mixed-effects model, and (iii) in the case of island sentences, lexical variability was more crucially affected by the factor Island than Location."

Baseline liver condition was categorized as non-ACLD, compensated ACLD, and decompensated ACLD. The liver-to-spleen signal intensity ratio (LS-SIR) and liver-to-spleen volume ratio (LS-VR) were automatically measured on the HBP images using a deep learning algorithm, and their percentage changes at the 1-year follow-up (ΔLS-SIR and ΔLS-VR) were calculated. The associations of the MRI indices with hepatic decompensation and a composite endpoint of liver-related death or transplantation were evaluated using a competing risk analysis with multivariable Fine and Gray regression models, including baseline parameters alone and both baseline and follow-up parameters.Results: Our study included 280 patients (153 male; mean age ± standard deviation, 57 ± 7.95 years) with non-ACLD, compensated ACLD, and decompensated ACLD in 32, 186, and 62 patients, respectively. Patients were followed for 11–117 months (median, 104 months). In patients with compensated ACLD, baseline LS-SIR (sub-distribution hazard ratio [sHR], 0.81; p = 0.034) and LS-VR (sHR, 0.71; p = 0.01) were independently associated with hepatic decompensation. The ∆LS-VR (sHR, 0.54; p = 0.002) was predictive of hepatic decompensation after adjusting for baseline variables. ∆LS-VR was an independent predictor of liver-related death or transplantation in patients with compensated ACLD (sHR, 0.46; p = 0.026) and decompensated ACLD (sHR, 0.61; p = 0.023).Conclusion: MRI indices automatically derived from the deep learning analysis of gadoxetic acid-enhanced HBP MRI can be used as prognostic markers in patients with ACLD."

Here, we used a Inception-v3 deep learning model to detect mouse lung metastatic tumors via whole slide imaging (WSI); we cropped the images to 151 by 151 pixels. The images were divided into training (53.8%) and test (46.2%) sets (21,017 and 18,016 images, respectively). When images from lung tissue containing tumor tissues were evaluated, the model accuracy was 98.76%. When images from normal lung tissue were evaluated, the model accuracy (“no tumor”) was 99.87%. Thus, the deep learning model distinguished metastatic lesions from normal lung tissue. Our approach will allow the rapid and accurate analysis of various tissues."

Remote Sensing Image Classification for Land Cover Mapping in Developing Countries: A Novel Deep Learning Approach,2022,"['Convolutional neural network', 'remote sensing image classification', 'Land cover mapping', 'medium-resolution']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) are a category of deep learning networks that have proven very effective in computer vision tasks such as image classification. Notwithstanding, not much has been seen in its use for remote sensing image classification in developing countries. This is majorly due to the scarcity of training data. Recently, transfer learning technique has successfully been used to develop state-of-the art models for remote sensing (RS) image classification tasks using training and testing data from well-known RS data repositories. However, the ability of such model to classify RS test data from a different dataset has not been sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we propose a deep CNN model that can classify RS test data from a dataset different from the training dataset. To achieve our objective, we first, re-trained a ResNet-50 model using EuroSAT, a large-scale RS dataset to develop a base model then we integrated Augmentation and Ensemble learning to improve its generalization ability. We further experimented on the ability of this model to classify a novel dataset (Nig_Images). The final classification results shows that our model achieves a 96% and 80% accuracy on EuroSAT and Nig_Images test data respectively. Adequate knowledge and usage of this framework is expected to encourage research and the usage of deep CNNs for land cover mapping in cases of lack of training data as obtainable in developing countries."
Multi-Cattle tracking with appearance and motion models in closed barns using deep learning,2022,"['deep learning', 'cattle tracking', 'closed barn', 'appearance', 'motion']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Precision livestock monitoring promises greater management efficiency for farmers and higher welfare standards for animals. Recent studies on video-based animal activity recognition and tracking have shown promising solutions for understanding animal behavior. To achieve that, surveillance cameras are installed diagonally above the barn in a typical cattle farm setup to monitor animals constantly. Under these circumstances, tracking individuals requires addressing challenges such as occlusion and visual appearance, which are the main reasons for track breakage and increased misidentification of animals. This paper presents a framework for multi-cattle tracking in closed barns with appearance and motion models. To overcome the above challenges, we modify the DeepSORT algorithm to achieve higher tracking accuracy by three contributions. First, we reduce the weight of appearance information. Second, we use an Ensemble Kalman Filter to predict the random motion information of cattle. Third, we propose a supplementary matching algorithm that compares the absolute cattle position in the barn to reassign lost tracks. The main idea of the matching algorithm assumes that the number of cattle is fixed in the barn, so the edge of the barn is where new trajectories are most likely to emerge. Experimental results are performed on our dataset collected on two cattle farms. Our algorithm achieves 70.37%, 77.39%, and 81.74% performance on HOTA, AssA, and IDF1, representing an improvement of 1.53%, 4.17%, and 0.96%, respectively, compared to the original method."

The model should take into account a large number of uncorrelated factors, for many of which information may be missing or vague. The individual contribution of one or another chemical element out of a dozen possible ligants cannot be determined by traditional methods. Moreover, there are no general analytical models describing the influence of elements on the characteristics of alloys. Artificial neural networks are one of the few statistical modeling tools that can account for many implicit correlations and establish correspondences that cannot be identified by other more familiar mathematical methods. However, such networks require careful tuning to achieve high performance, which is time-consuming. Data preprocessing can make model training much easier and faster.

Methods: The study sample included 890 cephalograms. The images were classified into six cervical stages independently by two orthodontists. The images were also categorized into three degrees on the basis of the growth spurt: pre-pubertal, growth spurt, and post-pubertal. Subsequently, the samples were fed to a transfer learning model implemented using the Python programming language and PyTorch library. In the last step, the test set of cephalograms was randomly coded and provided to two new orthodontists in order to compare their diagnosis to the artificial intelligence (AI) model’s performance using weighted kappa and Cohen’s kappa statistical analyses. Results: The model’s validation and test accuracy for the six-class CVM diagnosis were 62.63% and 61.62%, respectively. Moreover, the model’s validation and test accuracy for the three-class classification were 75.76% and 82.83%, respectively. Furthermore, substantial agreements were observed between the two orthodontists as well as one of them and the AI model. Conclusions: The newly developed AI model had reasonable accuracy in detecting the CVM stage and high reliability in detecting the pubertal stage. However, its accuracy was still less than that of human observers. With further improvements in data quality, this model should be able to provide practical assistance to practicing dentists in the future."

To implement the DL model to predict the severity of post-stroke aphasia, we designed a deep feed-forward network and utilized the lesion occupying ratio from DWI data and established clinical variables to estimate the aphasia quotient (AQ) score (range, 0 to 100) of the Korean version of the Western Aphasia Battery. To evaluate the performance of the DL model, we analyzed Cohen’s weighted kappa with linear weights for the categorized AQ score (0–25, very severe; 26–50, severe; 51–75, moderate; ≥76, mild) and Pearson’s correlation coefficient for continuous values.Results We identified 225 post-stroke aphasia patients, of whom 176 were included and analyzed. For the categorized AQ score, Cohen’s weighted kappa coefficient was 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42 to 0.76; P<0.001). For continuous AQ score, the correlation coefficient between true AQ scores and model-estimated values was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.83; P<0.001).Conclusions DL approaches using DWI data may be feasible and useful for estimating the severity of aphasia in the early stage of stroke."

The single models (normal image- and multispectral image-based) and consensus models were developed used to four CNN model architecture (InceptionNet, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet) and select well-performed model.Results For single models, such as normal image- or multispectral image-based model, the best accuracies and Matthew’s correlation coefficients (MCCs) for validation data set were 0.80 and 0.64 for bacterial dermatosis, 0.70 and 0.36 for fungal infection, and 0.82 and 0.47 for hypersensitivity allergic dermatosis. For the consensus models, the best accuracies and MCCs for the validation set were 0.89 and 0.76 for the bacterial dermatosis data set, 0.87 and 0.63 for the fungal infection data set, and 0.87 and 0.63 for the hypersensitivity allergic dermatosis data set, respectively, which supported that the consensus models of each disease were more balanced and well-performed.Conclusions We developed consensus models for each skin disease for dogs by combining each best model developed with the normal and multispectral images, respectively. Since the normal images could be used to determine areas suspected of lesion of skin disease and additionally the multispectral images could help confirming skin redness of the area, the models achieved higher prediction accuracy with balanced performance between sensitivity and specificity."
Deep learning driven beam selection for orthogonal beamforming with limited feedback,2022,"['Downlink beamforming', 'Deep learning', 'Limited feedback', 'Orthogonal beam selection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This letter studies deep learning methods for beam selection in multiuser beamforming with limited feedback. We construct a set of orthogonal random beams and allocate the beams to users to maximize the sum rate, based on limited feedback regarding the channel power on the orthogonal beams. We formulate the beam allocation problem as a classification or a regression task using a deep neural network (DNN). The results demonstrate that the DNN-based methods achieve higher sum rates than a conventional limited feedback solution in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime under Rician fading, thanks to their robustness to noisy limited feedback."

A Study on the Dynamic Image-Based Dark Channel Prior and Smoke Detection Using Deep Learning,2022,"['Deep learning', 'Dark channel prior', 'Optical flow technique', 'Image pre-processing', 'CNN']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The detection of smoke in a fi re is a very important research topic because a large amount of carbon monoxide, which is potentially lethal, can be generated and released in the early stages of a fi re. In particular, if a fi re occurs in the form of smoldering combustion, it produces a glowing combustion without fl ames on the surface of the heat source, and the temperature is over 1000 °C. In this study, the dark channel prior, an algorithm previously used for haze removal, is used to detect areas where smoke may exist. The dark channel characteristic makes it possible to eff ectively detect the smoke area included background interference or noise. Additionally, in order to detect the characteristic that the smoke generated from the fi re rises due to the density diff erence at high temperatures, the area of the smoke was detected using the optical fl ow technique based on the Lucas–Kanade method. Image pre-processing using the dark channel prior and the optical fl ow technique can eff ectively detect the smoke areas and signifi cantly reduce false positive rate. Through this, in order to accurately determine the fi ltered region as smoke or non-smoke, a Convolutional Neural Network was employed. As a result, it was confi rmed that accuracy and precision were improved by 4% and 7%, respectively, compared to object detection models that performed detection without image pre-processing."

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 153 patients who underwent SBRT for lung nodules between 2010 and 2019. A total of 3,350 radiomic computed tomography (CT) features of radiotherapy simulation (shape, intensity, texture, and log flters) were extracted. Among them, 30 factors were selected through Pearson’s correlation analysis and subjected to analysis. A proposed lung toxicity prediction model was developed using a deep neural network algorithm. The programming language used was Python. The data were divided into a training set (70% of data) and a test/validation set (30% of data). We adjusted the original data by oversampling to correct the uneven sample distribution to balance the data set. The Talos library was used in this study for hyperparameter determination and the model with the highest accuracy was selected. The Talos library provided the RP prediction model with the highest accuracy of 94.8%. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.90, which was relatively fair. It showed relatively high accuracy in the RP prediction model based on the clinical, dosimetric, and radiomic factors of patients who received SBRT for lung nodules.

Deep learning in nickel-based superalloys solvus temperature simulation,2022,"['artificial neural network', 'framework', 'nickel-based superalloys', 'simulation', 'solvus temperature']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Modeling the properties of complex alloys such as nickel superalloys is an extremely challenging scientific and engineering task. The model should take into account a large number of uncorrelated factors, for many of which information may be missing or vague. The individual contribution of one or another chemical element out of a dozen possible ligants cannot be determined by traditional methods. Moreover, there are no general analytical models describing the influence of elements on the characteristics of alloys. Artificial neural networks are one of the few statistical modeling tools that can account for many implicit correlations and establish correspondences that cannot be identified by other more familiar mathematical methods. However, such networks require careful tuning to achieve high performance, which is time-consuming. Data preprocessing can make model training much easier and faster. This article focuses on combining physics-based deep network configuration and input data engineering to simulate the solvus temperature of nickel superalloys. The used deep artificial neural network shows good simulation results. Thus, this method of numerical simulation can be easily applied to such problems."

This study proposes automating the generation of high-quality 3D point cloud data and removing noise using deep learning algorithms. In this study, large-format aerial images of civilian infrastructure, such as cut slopes and dams, which were captured by drones, were used to develop a workflow for automatically generating a 3D point cloud model. Through image cropping, downscaling/upscaling, semantic segmentation, generation of segmentation masks, and implementation of region extraction algorithms, the generation of the point cloud was automated. Compared with the method wherein the point cloud model is generated from raw images, our method could effectively improve the quality of the model, remove noise, and reduce the processing time. The results showed that the size of the 3D point cloud model created using the proposed method was significantly reduced; the number of points was reduced by 20-50%, and distant points were recognized as noise. This method can be applied to the automatic generation of high-quality 3D point cloud models of civil infrastructures using aerial imagery."

The existing RUL prediction method utilized health indicators (HIs) that are extracted by a conventional method. This method has the risk of dropping useful information in the supercapacitor data which leads to low accuracy because of poor quality features. To resolve this issue, this paper proposes an optimized end-to-end deep learning model for RUL prediction.Specifically, a genetic algorithm (GA) for automatic feature selection and long short-term memory (LSTM) network (GA-LSTM) for RUL prediction. GA is utilized for automatic feature extraction which ensures all important information in the supercapacitor data is considered during HI extraction. The combination of the best-selected features is used as the input to the LSTM model for final RUL prediction. Our proposed model achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03 unlike the recurrent neural network, LSTM, and deep convolutional neural network with RMSE of 23.87, 0.51, and 0.38, respectively.

These parameters were compared between the DLR, FBP, and hybrid IR methods.Results: DLR provided higher Hounsfield unit (HU) values in the aorta and similar attenuation in the fat and muscle compared with FBP and hybrid IR. The image noise in HU was significantly lower in DLR (12.6 ± 2.2) than in hybrid IR (24.2 ± 3.0) and FBP (54.2 ± 9.5) (p < 0.001). The SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the DLR group than in the FBP and hybrid IR groups (p < 0.001).

However, the communication bandwidth is still a major bottleneck of training performance. To improve overall training performance, recent works have proposed gradient sparsification methods that reduce the communication traffic significantly. Most of them require gradient sorting to select meaningful gradients such as Top-k gradient sparsification (Top-k SGD). However, Top-k SGD has a limit to increase the speed up overall training performance because gradient sorting is significantly inefficient on GPUs. In this paper, we conduct experiments that show the inefficiency of Top-k SGD and provide the insight of the low performance. Based on observations from our empirical analysis, we plan to yield a high performance gradient sparsification method as a future work."

SwinE-Net: hybrid deep learning approach to novel polyp segmentation using convolutional neural network and Swin Transformer,2022,"['polyp segmentation', 'convolutional neural networks', 'multidilation convolutional block', 'multifeature aggregation block', 'Swin Transformer', 'Vision Transformer']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) by inspecting and removing colorectal polyps has become a global health priority because CRC is one of the most frequent cancers in the world. Although recent U-Net-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with deep feature representation and skip connections have shown to segment polyps effectively, U-Net-based approaches still have limitations in modeling explicit global contexts, due to the intrinsic nature locality of convolutional operations. To overcome these problems, this study proposes a novel deep learning model, SwinE-Net, for polyp segmentation that effectively combines a CNN-based EfficientNet and Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Swin Ttransformer. The main challenge is to conduct accurate and robust medical segmentation in maintaining global semantics without sacrificing low-level features of CNNs through Swin Transformer. First, the multidilation convolutional block generates refined feature maps to enhance feature discriminability for multilevel feature maps extracted from CNN and ViT. Then, the multifeature aggregation block creates intermediate side outputs from the refined polyp features for efficient training. Finally, the attentive deconvolutional network-based decoder upsamples the refined and combined feature maps to accurately segment colorectal polyps. We compared the proposed approach with previous state-of-the-art methods by evaluating various metrics using five public datasets (Kvasir, ClinicDB, ColonDB, ETIS, and EndoScene). The comparative evaluation, in particular, proved that the proposed approach showed much better performance in the unseen dataset, which shows the generalization and scalability in conducting polyp segmentation. Furthermore, an ablation study was performed to prove the novelty and advantage of the proposed network. The proposed approach outperformed previous studies."

Robust masonry crack segmentation and measurement based on deep learning,2022,"['crack segmentation', 'deep learning', 'masonry', 'measurement', 'inspection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Masonry is a common type of construction that uses mortar to bind individual units, such as brick or building stones, together to construct the structure. Even though masonry structures are durable, multiple factors such as the quality of mortar, workmanship, and harsh environment could greatly reduce the structural integrity, leading to defects and even human loss. Thus, it is crucial to perform the maintenance process regularly. Previously, the maintenance relied mainly on inspectors, who inspected the masonry structures to find cracks and determine the seriousness. However, this process is error-prone, costly, and time-consuming. As a result, this study proposes a fully automated masonry crack segmentation framework that robustly identifies various types of masonry cracks. In addition, the length of the segmentation cracks, which has been ignored in previous studies, is also computed."

Condition assessment of stay cables through enhanced time series classification using a deep learning approach,2022,"['bridge cable', 'damage detection', 'deep learning', 'time series classification']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Stay cables play an essential role in cable-stayed bridges. Severe vibrations and/or harsh environment may result in cable failures. Therefore, an efficient structural health monitoring (SHM) solution for cable damage detection is necessary. This study proposes a data-driven method for immediately detecting cable damage from measured cable forces by recognizing pattern transition from the intact condition when damage occurs. In the proposed method, pattern recognition for cable damage detection is realized by time series classification (TSC) using a deep learning (DL) model, namely, the long short term memory fully convolutional network (LSTM-FCN). First, a TSC classifier is trained and validated using the cable forces (or cable force ratios) collected from intact stay cables, setting the segmented data series as input and the cable (or cable pair) ID as class labels. Subsequently, the classifier is tested using the data collected under possible damaged conditions. Finally, the cable or cable pair corresponding to the least classification accuracy is recommended as the most probable damaged cable or cable pair. A case study using measured cable forces from an in-service cable-stayed bridge shows that the cable with damage can be correctly identified using the proposed DL-TSC method. Compared with existing cable damage detection methods in the literature, the DL-TSC method requires minor data preprocessing and feature engineering and thus enables fast and convenient early detection in real applications."

LDCT images were reconstructed with hybrid iterative reconstruction (h-IR) and DLIR at medium and high strengths (DLIR-M and DLIR-H), while SDCT images were reconstructed with h-IR. For quantitative image quality analysis, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio were measured in the liver, muscle, and aorta. Among the three different LDCT reconstruction algorithms, the one showing the smallest difference in quantitative parameters from those of SDCT images was selected for qualitative image quality analysis and lesion detectability evaluation. For qualitative analysis, overall image quality, image noise, image sharpness, image texture, and lesion conspicuity were graded using a 5-point scale by two radiologists. Observer performance in focal liver lesion detection was evaluated by comparing the jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic figures-of-merit (FOM).Results: LDCT (35.1% dose reduction compared with SDCT) images obtained using DLIR-M showed similar quantitative measures to those of SDCT with h-IR images. All qualitative parameters of LDCT with DLIR-M images but image texture were similar to or significantly better than those of SDCT with h-IR images. The lesion detectability on LDCT with DLIR-M images was not significantly different from that of SDCT with h-IR images (reader-averaged FOM, 0.887 vs. 0.874, respectively; p = 0.581).Conclusion: Overall image quality and detectability of focal liver lesions is preserved in contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic LDCT obtained with DLIR-M relative to those in SDCT with h-IR."
"Damaged cable detection with statistical analysis, clustering, and deep learning models",2022,"['anomaly detection', 'clustering', 'deep learning', 'LSTM', 'time series']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The cable component of cable-stayed bridges is gradually impacted by weather conditions, vehicle loads, and material corrosion. The stayed cable is a critical load-carrying part that closely affects the operational stability of a cable-stayed bridge. Damaged cables might lead to the bridge collapse due to their tension capacity reduction. Thus, it is necessary to develop structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques that accurately identify damaged cables. In this work, a combinational identification method of three efficient techniques, including statistical analysis, clustering, and neural network models, is proposed to detect the damaged cable in a cable-stayed bridge. The measured dataset from the bridge was initially preprocessed to remove the outlier channels. Then, the theory and application of each technique for damage detection were introduced. In general, the statistical approach extracts the parameters representing the damage within time series, and the clustering approach identifies the outliers from the data signals as damaged members, while the deep learning approach uses the nonlinear data dependencies in SHM for the training model. The performance of these approaches in classifying the damaged cable was assessed, and the combinational identification method was obtained using the voting ensemble. Finally, the combination method was compared with an existing outlier detection algorithm, support vector machines (SVM). The results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and provides higher accuracy for the damaged cable detection in the cable-stayed bridge."

A commercial deep learning (DL) algorithm based on 2D U-net (Myomics-T1 software, version 1.0.0) was used for the automated analysis of T1 maps. Four radiologists, as study readers, performed manual analysis. The reference standard was the consensus result of the manual analysis by two additional expert readers. The segmentation performance of the DL algorithm and the correlation and agreement between the automated measurement and the reference standard were assessed. Interobserver agreement among the four radiologists was analyzed.Results: DL successfully segmented the myocardium in 99.3% of slices in the native T1 map and 89.8% of slices in the post-T1 map with Dice similarity coefficients of 0.86 ± 0.05 and 0.74 ± 0.17, respectively.

For 100 underwater images taken in Korean seas, the average UIQMs of CycleGAN, UGAN, and FUnIE-GAN were 3.91, 3.42, and 2.66, respectively, and the average UCIQEs were measured to be 29.9, 26.77, and 22.88, respectively. The average UIQM and UCIQE of Image Fusion were 3.63 and 23.59, respectively. CycleGAN and UGAN qualitatively and quantitatively improved the image quality in various underwater environments, and FUnIE-GAN had performance differences depending on the underwater environment. Image Fusion showed good performance in terms of color correction and sharpness enhancement. It is expected that this method can be used for monitoring underwater works and the autonomous operation of unmanned vehicles by improving the visibility of underwater situations more accurately."

In this study, we introduce a lightweight head detectionnetwork using deep learning applicable to an embedded system. Currently, object detection algorithms usingdeep learning have been found to be successful. However, these algorithms essentially need a graphicsprocessing unit (GPU) to make them performable in real-time. So, we modify a Tiny-YOLOv3 network usingcertain techniques to speed up the proposed network and to make it more accurate in a non-GPU environment.Finally, we introduce an APC system, which is performable in real-time on embedded systems, using theproposed head detection algorithm. We implement and test the proposed APC system on a Samsung ARTIK710 board. The experimental results on three public head datasets reflect the detection accuracy and efficiencyof the proposed head detection network against Tiny-YOLOv3. Moreover, to test the proposed APC system,we measured the accuracy and recognition speed by repeating 50 instances of entering and 50 instances ofexiting. These experimental results showed 99% accuracy and a 0.041-second recognition speed despite thefact that only the CPU was used."

Spatial Pyramid Pooling based end-to-end deep learning for mammogram breast masses classification,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Mammography is the frontline in breast cancer early screening, playing important role in decreasing the death from breast cancer. Breast masses characterization is the most important factor that doctors investigate for early breast cancer diagnosis using mammogram. Nevertheless, it is challenging to classify breast masses as benign and malignant at early stage. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) improved this task even though CNNs concentrate too much on local features disregarding the whole image. Here, we propose the inclusion of spatial pyramid pooling layer for multi-scale end-to-end deep learning to classify mammogram breast mass images using the publicly available Inbreast and Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) datasets. Our model have been implemented using EfficientNetB2 backbone and Adam optimizer. Preliminary classification results observed are test accuracy 99.08% on INbreast and 99.99% on DDSM datasets, averaged over 5-fold cross-validation. With further improvements by thoroughly investigating with the utilization of different deep learning parameters, the method is expected to provide better results."
Quantitative Assessment of the Impact of Lossy JPEG Compression on Deep Learning Models,2022,"['JPEG', 'human visual system', 'computer vision', 'deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Lossy image compression provides an efficient solution to the exchange and storage of image data for consumer applications. The design of lossy algorithms is based on a principle to discard information that are not perceivable by human visual system (HVS). With the popularity of deep learning models (DL) in computer vision (CV), it is necessary to characterize the loss in image quality with respect to computer vision systems as well. Recent studies have analyzed the image distortions resulted from blur and noise, mainly from an adversarial attack perspective. However, fewer studies have dealt with the lossy nature of the JPEG algorithm. Therefore, the current study presents a quantitative assessment of different types of data loss that occurs due to chroma subsampling, quantization, and rounding functions of the JPEG algorithm. In addition, we have analyzed impact of different interpolation methods that are used for chroma upsampling. The analysis have shown that for compression savings, performing either subsampling or quantization preserved the model accuracy while their combination degraded the accuracy by 6%."

After the COVID-19 outbreak, the overabundance of fake information and rumours on online social platforms about the COVID-19 pandemic has spread over society as quickly as the virus itself. As a result, fake news poses a significant threat to effective virus response by negatively affecting people’s willingness to follow the proper public health guidelines and protocols, which makes it important to identify fake information from online platforms for the public interest. In this research, we introduce an approach to detect fake news using deep learning techniques, which outperform traditional machine learning techniques with a 93.1% accuracy. We then investigate the content differences between real and fake news by applying topic modeling and linguistic analysis. Our results show that topics on Politics and Government services are most common in fake news. In addition, we found that fake news has lower analytic and authenticity scores than real news.

Because the quality of SPR joints is mainly evaluated through cross sectional inspection, which is a type of destructive inspection, it is expensive and time-consuming. Machine learning technology is being proposed as a non-destructive testing because it can predict the quality based on the signals generated during the process. However, research result on the quality prediction modeling of SPR joints have not yet been reported. In this study, the prediction accuracy according to the signal combination was compared and evaluated by applying the CNN algorithm using the displacement and load signals generated during the SPR process and the acoustic signal obtained from the acoustic sensor. The materials used in the experiment were SGAFC 1180Y, CFRP, and SPFC 590 and the thickness were 1.4 mm, 1.8 mm, and 1.0 m respectively and a three-layer SPR process was performed. After evaluating joining was performed by selecting the abnormal process conditions, with 12 con- ditions that may occur during the process. Consequently, in the case of the first model in which the CNN algorithm was based on displacement and load signals, the quality prediction accuracy was estimated to be 90.0%. In the case of the second model in which the CNN algorithm added acoustic signals to the displacement and load signals, the quality prediction accuracy was estimated to be 77.5%."

Gait Type Classification Using Multi-modal Ensemble Deep Learning Network,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper proposes a system for classifying gait types using an ensemble deep learning network for gait data measured by a smart insole equipped with multi-sensors. The gait type classification system consists of a part for normalizing the data measured by the insole, a part for extracting gait features using a deep learning network, and a part for classifying the gait type by inputting the extracted features. Two kinds of gait feature maps were extracted by independently learning networks based on CNNs and LSTMs with different characteristics. The final ensemble network classification results were obtained by combining the classification results.

Prediction of the superiority of the hydrodynamic performance of hull forms using deep learning,2022,"['Hull form design Hydrodynamic performance', 'Superiority prediction', 'Deep learning', 'Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)', 'Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"When designing a ship's hull form, a designer creates various candidate hull forms and performs a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis to evaluate the performance of each candidate. Designers consider quantitative indicators, such as the total resistance and wake coefficient, and qualitative indicators, such as the wave height and pressure distributions, when evaluating the performance of a hull form. During the design process, quantitative and qualitative indicators are often used to determine the superiority of two hull forms. However, in the case of quantitative indicators, the difference between the two hull forms is often minimal; thus, superiority cannot be readily determined. Furthermore, because qualitative indicators are in the form of images, it is challenging to determine the superiority in many cases, even for experienced designers. To solve this problem, we propose a convolutional neural networkbased model for predicting the superiority of hull form performance from a qualitative indicator of the image form derived from CFD analysis. The proposed prediction model received various types of hull form performance images. From these results, the hull form performance characteristics were well fused for prediction with high accuracy. CFD analysis images and quantitative indicators for 1600 hull forms were used to determine the superiority of the prediction model. The learned model was verified using 240 hulls. The result confirmed that the proposed model accurately predicted superiority with an accuracy of approximately 94%."

This project utilizes a single RGB camera for hand gesture recognition and localization. The dataset of all gestures used for training and its corresponding commands, are custom designed by the authors due to the lack of standard gestures specifi cally for human–computer interaction. Algorithms to integrate gesture commands with virtual mouse and keyboard input through the Pynput library in Python, were developed to handle commands such as mouse control, media control, and others.

This algorithm consists of four steps: 1) Acquisition of 2D images and 3D point clouds of objects; 2) Object recognition in the 2D images; 3) Grasping pose selection; 4) Choice of a grasping time and control of the prosthetic hand. The grasping pose selection is necessary when the algorithm detects many objects in the same frame, and must decide which pose of the prosthetic hand should use. The pose was chosen considering the object that was to the prosthesis. The grasping time was determined by the operating point when approaching the selected target after selecting the grasping pose; this choice uses an empirically-determined distance threshold. The proposed method achieved 89% accuracy of the grasping the intended object. The failures occurred because of slight inaccuracy in object localization, occlusion of target objects, and the inability of DL object detection. Work to solve these shortcomings is ongoing.

Taking the traffic flow data based on the highway network structure as the research object, this paper uses the deep learning theory technology to complete the path weight determination process, optimizes the path planning algorithm, realizes the vehicle path planning application for the expressway, and carries on the deployment operation in the highway company. The path topology is constructed to transform the actual road information into abstract space that the machine can understand. An appropriate data structure is used for storage, and a path topology based on the modeling background of expressway is constructed to realize the mutual mapping between the two. Experiments show that the proposed method can further reduce the interpolation error, and the interpolation error in the case of random missing is smaller than that in the other two missing modes. In order to improve the real-time performance of vehicle path planning, the association features are selected, the path weights are calculated comprehensively, and the traditional path planning algorithm structure is optimized.

Development of a spontaneous pain indicator based on brain cellular calcium using deep learning,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Chronic pain remains an intractable condition in millions of patients worldwide. Spontaneous ongoing pain is a major clinical problem of chronic pain and is extremely challenging to diagnose and treat compared to stimulus-evoked pain. Although extensive efforts have been made in preclinical studies, there still exists a mismatch in pain type between the animal model and humans (i.e., evoked vs. spontaneous), which obstructs the translation of knowledge from preclinical animal models into objective diagnosis and effective new treatments. Here, we developed a deep learning algorithm, designated AI-bRNN (Average training, Individual test-bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network), to detect spontaneous pain information from brain cellular Ca2+ activity recorded by two-photon microscopy imaging in awake, head-fixed mice. AI-bRNN robustly determines the intensity and time points of spontaneous pain even in chronic pain models and evaluates the efficacy of analgesics in real time. Furthermore, AI-bRNN can be applied to various cell types (neurons and glia), brain areas (cerebral cortex and cerebellum) and forms of somatosensory input (itch and pain), proving its versatile performance. These results suggest that our approach offers a clinically relevant, quantitative, real-time preclinical evaluation platform for pain medicine, thereby accelerating the development of new methods for diagnosing and treating human patients with chronic pain."

The proposed mode and approach are driven by lifecycle big data of large cluster products and employs deep learning to train the neural networks to identify the fault features, thereby monitoring the products’ health status. This new mode is applied to a real case of a leading CNC machine provider to illustrate its feasibility. Higher accuracy and shortened time for fault prediction are realised, resulting in the provider’s saving of the maintenance and operation cost."
Character Identification for Integrated Circuit Components on Printed Circuit Boards Using Deep Learning,2022,"['Integrated circuit component', 'ICChaNet', 'Contour extraction', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Character identification']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Conventional defect detection and recognition algorithms for integrated circuit (IC) components, used in printed circuit boards (PCBs), are primarily based on automated optical inspection (AOI). These techniques typically extract image features using image processing models, which are heavily dependent on visual cues and can thus be inaccurate. To address these issues, we propose the use of a deep convolutional neural network, an improved LeNet-5 structure called ICChaNet with a deeper structure and more complex parameters. First, the algorithm for character extraction is implemented and used to generate character samples from IC component images. This process includes grayscaling, binarization, and contour extraction, applied to a set of IC component images to establish 53 categories of characters (letters and number with similar symbols removed).Three critical hyperparameters, including learning rate, pooling strategy, and optimization strategy, are then optimized through a comparative analysis. The eff ect of diff erent network architectures on model effi ciency is also investigated by varying the layer depth. A combination classifi er strategy is subsequently added to the fully connected layers to strengthen the feature expression in the corresponding classes. Finally, the performance of the proposed ICChaNet model is verifi ed through a comparison with popular CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that ICChaNet has achieved a classifi cation accuracy of 98.5% and a test average accuracy precision of 97.73%. These results suggest the proposed ICChaNet model is a promising approach for automated character identifi cation"
Emergency Exit Signs Detecting Smart Glasses Based on Deep Learning for the Visually Impaired,2022,"['Smart Glasses', 'Assistive Device', 'Object Detection', 'Emergency signs']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Emergency exit signs are crucial during misfortunate events such as fire, earthquakes or even human caused events such as robbery and, bombing. However, these signs are of no use to the visually impaired people. During emergency scenarios, the blind people need to rely on other individuals and sometimes they may even be left helpless. This raises a need for some assistive device that could benefit the visually impaired people during the time of emergency. In this paper, we propose a concept of smart glasses that could be tremendously beneficial to the blind people. These glasses will have camera and headphone speakers embedded to them. The device will be capable of detecting emergency signs using modern deep learning techniques during the times of need and could notify the user regarding the direction where the exit is."

Newly Discovered z ~ 5 Quasars Based on Deep Learning and Bayesian Information Criterion,2022,"['galaxies: active', 'galaxies: quasars: general', 'methods: data analysis', 'methods: observational', 'techniques: spectroscopic']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We report the discovery of four quasars with $M_{1450} \gtrsim -25.0$ mag at z ~ 5 and supermassive black hole mass measurement for one of the quasars. They were selected as promising high-redshift quasar candidates via deep learning and Bayesian information criterion, which are expected to be effective in discriminating quasars from the late-type stars and high-redshift galaxies. The candidates were observed by the Double Spectrograph on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope. They show clear Ly$\alpha$ breaks at about 7000--8000 \AA, indicating they are quasars at $4.7 < z < 5.6$. For HSC J233107-001014, we measure the mass of its supermassive black hole (SMBH) using its C IV $\lambda 1549$ emission line. The SMBH mass and Eddington ratio of the quasar are found to be ~10$^8 M_{\odot}$ and ~0.6, respectively. This suggests that this quasar possibly harbors a fast growing SMBH near the Eddington limit despite its faintness ($L_{\rm Bol} < 10^{46} $erg\,s$^{-1}$). Our 100\% quasar identification rate supports high efficiency of our deep learning and Bayesian information criterion selection method, which can be applied to future surveys to increase high-redshift quasar sample."

Crack Detection Based on Generative Adversarial Networks and Deep Learning,2022,"['Structural health monitoring', 'Generative adversarial network', 'Generated images', 'Crack classification', 'Crack segmentation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper proposes a novel crack detection method using the three-stages detection model. Deep learning technology has been a focus of attention in the field of crack detection; however, it needs big data to train the corresponding network model. More training samples and the combination of multiple deep learning algorithms help to improve the detection performance. Therefore, this paper employed a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to generate abundant virtual crack images with similar features to real images, these virtual images are used to train the CNN classifier and DeepLab_v3+ respectively, and then the real images are used to evaluate the performance of the three-stages detection method. The results show that the proposed three-stages detection method has excellent detection effect on the crack detection is better than that of the control experiment (the NI_MIoU, NI_Accuracy, NI_F-score and NI_MCC are increased by 22.1% − 55.6%, 5.2% − 9.8%, 37.4% − 40.0% and 6.2% − 11.1%, respectively)). These results demonstrate that the three-stages detection model has made a beneficial contribution to the crack detection."
Research on bolt contour extraction and counting of locomotive running gear based on deep learning,2022,"['Semantic segmentation', 'Target count', 'Locomotive running gear', 'Daily maintenance', 'Deeplearning', 'Feature fusion']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The detection of abnormal running gear is essential to a locomotive’s daily maintenance, with the posture and quantity of various small bolts being important indicators to judge whether the locomotive is running safely. Traditional detection algorithms are easily affected by light changes, stain coverage, and image distortion, which is difficult to meet the detection requirements. Thus this paper proposes a deep learning based on bolt detection method that is appropriate for locomotive running gears. First, a bolt segmentation network was developed based on an improved U-netthat compensates the image information loss after multiple cross fusions involving the fusion of front and back convolution layer feature images. Furthermore, the proposed network utilizes the PReLU activation function and employs the concept structure to optimize the convolution method. This strategy aims to improve further the model’s segmentation accuracy and convergence speed. On this basis, we exploited several morphological transformations to improve the contour detection accuracy and ensure the bolt counting accuracy. The experimental results on the mainline running train data highlight that, compared with U-net, the proposed network’s recall rate and the mean intersection over union value are increased by 5.38 and 14.3, respectively. Furthermore, the bolt counting method’s loss function and mean absolute errors are significantly reduced compared with the contour extraction algorithm."

Especially in chemical engineering, fluid motion usually has extensive effects on system states, such as temperature and component concentration. However, due to the critical issue of long computational times for simulating CFD, application of CFD is limited for many real-time problems, such as real-time optimization and process control.In this study, we developed a surrogate model of a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with van de Vusse reaction using physics-informed neural network (PINN), which can train the governing equations of the system. We propose a PINN architecture that can train every governing equation which a chemical reactor system follows and can train a multi-reference frame system. Also, we investigated that PINN can resolve the problem of neural network that needs a large number of training data, is easily overfitted and cannot contain physical meaning. Furthermore, we modified the original PINN suggested by Raissi to solve the memory error and divergence problem with two methods: Mini-batch training and weighted loss function. We also suggest a similarity-based sampling strategy where the accuracy can be improved up to five times over random sampling. This work can provide a guideline for developing a high performance surrogate model of the chemical process."

Long-term dam behavior prediction with deep learning on graphs,2022,"['health monitoring', 'spatial-temporal feature', 'graph convolutional network', 'dam displacement prediction', 'long short-term memory networks']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Dam displacement prediction is one of the most crucial considerations for ensuring the dam’s long-term safe operation. Most existing models focus on predicting individual displacement and ignore the spatial and temporal correlation of data. To address these issues, a novel prediction model based on attention mechanism and graph convolutional network is proposed. To extract the spatial and temporal correlation of the original data, the position embedding and aggregation modules are employed in the prediction model. Through the aggregation module, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed. The spatial-temporal chart connects spatial diagrams of different time steps together. To capture the spatial-temporal features in the constructed graph, a recurrent graph convolutional module is employed. Through the recurrent graph convolutional module, the spatial-temporal features are used to predict the dam displacement. For verification, an arch dam is taken as an example. Comparing eight baseline models, the proposed model is more effective than other prediction models. Therefore, the proposed model can be adapted for engineering applications."

Thus, the Comprehensive in vitro proarrhythmia assay (CiPA) project was successful in classifying to assess drug-induced arrhythmias through a logistic regression model using qNet as a TdP risk assessment biomarker. However, obtaining that result through in silico simulation is inefficient. We propose using the CNN model to classify three levels of proarrhythmic risk: high, intermediate, and low. To obtain net charges and calcium transients, we use the ToRd myocyte cell model. Drug effects were implemented using IC50 and Hill coefficient. There are 12 drugs as CNN model training data and 16 drugs as test data. qNet variability, qInward variability, CaD90 variability, CaD50 variability, and Ca resting variability are used as input in the CNN model independently. As the result, qInward variability showed better performance for the three classifications, 83% high-risk drug, 80% intermediate, and 80% low-risk drug."

In this paper, we propose a method to detect the ulcer area on a pixel basis in corneal ulcer images using a semantic segmentation model. In order to solve this problem, we performed the experiment to detect the ulcer area based on the DeepLab model which has the highest performance in semantic segmentation model. For the experiment, the training and test data were selected and the backbone network of DeepLab model which set as Xception and ResNet, respectively were evaluated and compared the performances. We used Dice similarity coefficient and IoU value as an indicator to evaluate the performances. Experimental results show that when 'crop & resized' images are added to the dataset, it segment the ulcer area with an average accuracy about 93% of Dice similarity coefficient on the DeepLab model with ResNet101 as the backbone network. This study shows that the semantic segmentation model used for object detection also has an ability to make significant results when classifying objects with irregular shapes such as corneal ulcers. Ultimately, we will perform the extension of datasets and experiment with adaptive learning methods through future studies so that they can be implemented in real medical diagnosis environment."

Planning the best path of urban greenery is a means to effectively maximize the use of urban greenery, which plays a positive role in the physical and mental health of urban residents and the path planning of visitors. In this paper, we used Google street view to obtain street view images of Osaka City. The semantic segmentation model is adopted to segment the street view images and analyze the green view index (GVI) of Osaka City. Based on the GVI, we take advantage of the adjacency matrix and Floyd–Warshall algorithm to calculate GVI best path, solving the limitations of ArcGIS software. Our analysis not only allows the calculation of specific routes for the GVI best paths but also realizes the visualization and integration of neighborhood urban greenery. By summarizing all the data, we can conduct an intuitive feeling and objective analysis of the street-level greenery in the research area.

Continuous Control of Autonomous Vehicles using Plan-assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning,2022,"['Autonomous driving', 'intelligent vehicles', 'world models', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'artificial intelligence']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"End-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is emerging as a promising paradigm for autonomous driving. Although DRL provides an elegant framework to accomplish final goals without extensive manual engineering, capturing plans and behavior using deep neural networks is still an unsolved issue. End-to-end architectures, as a result, are currently limited to simple driving scenarios, often performing sub-optimally when rare, unique conditions are encountered. We propose a novel plan-assisted deep reinforcement learning framework that, along with the typical state-space, leverages a “trajectory-space” to learn optimal control. While the trajectory-space, generated by an external planner, intrinsically captures the agent’s high-level plans, world models are used to understand the dynamics of the environment for learning behavior in latent space. An actor-critic network, trained in imagination, uses these latent features to predict policy and state-value function. Based primarily on DreamerV2 and Racing Dreamer, the proposed model is first trained in a simulator and eventually tested on the F1TENTH race car. We evaluate our model for best lap times against parametertuned and learning-based controllers on unseen race tracks and demonstrate that it generalizes to complex scenarios where other approaches perform sub-optimally. Furthermore, we show the model’s enhanced stability as a trajectory tracker and establish the improvement in interpretability achieved by the proposed framework."

Currently, rule-based EMSs and optimizationbased EMSs are faced with the challenge when considering the optimality and the real-time performance of the control at the same time. Along with the rapid development of the artificial intelligence, learning-based EMSs have gained more and more attention recently, which are able to overcome the above challenge. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based EMS is proposed for fuel cell hybrid buses (FCHBs) in this research, in which the fuel cell durability is considered and evaluated based on a fuel cell degradation model. The action space of the DRL algorithm is limited according to the efficiency characteristic of the fuel cell in order to improve the fuel economy and the Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) is adopted for improving the convergence performance of the DRL algorithm. Simulation results of the proposed DRL-based EMS for an FCHB are compared to those of a dynamic programming (DP)-based EMS and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based EMS. Comparison results show that the fuel economy of the proposed DRL-based EMS is improved by an average of 3.63% compared to the RL-based EMS, while the difference to the DP-based EMS is within an average of 5.69%. In addition, the fuel cell degradation rate is decreased by an average of 63.49% using the proposed DRL-based EMS compared to the one without considering the fuel cell durability. Furthermore, the convergence rate of the proposed DRL-based EMS is improved by an average of 30.54% compared to the one without using the PER. Finally, the adaptability of the proposed DRL-based EMS is validated on a new driving cycle, whereas the training of the DRL algorithm is completed on the other three driving cycles."

In this study, three foldable spoilers were designed at the tail of the IPT to optimize the flow field. The vibration of the IPT can be alleviated by adjusting the angles of the spoilers. A vibration reduction control system of the IPT was designed based on deep reinforcement learning. First, we conducted an experiment for vibration reduction system.

Due to the complexity of regional bridge structural conditions and a large number of inspection and maintenance actions, decision-makers generally choose traditional passive management strategies. They are less efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This paper suggests a deep reinforcement learning framework employing double-deep Q-networks (DDQNs) to improve the life-cycle management of deteriorating regional bridges to tackle these problems. It could produce optimal maintenance plans considering restrictions to maximize maintenance cost-effectiveness to the greatest extent possible. DDQNs method could handle the problem of the overestimation of Q-values in the Nature DQNs. This study also identifies regional bridge deterioration characteristics and the consequence of scheduled maintenance from years of inspection data. To validate the proposed method, a case study containing hundreds of bridges is used to develop optimal life-cycle management strategies. The optimization solutions recommend fewer replacement actions and prefer preventative repair actions when bridges are damaged or are expected to be damaged. By employing the optimal life-cycle regional maintenance strategies, the conditions of bridges can be controlled to a good level. Compared to the nature DQNs, DDQNs offer an optimized scheme containing fewer low-condition bridges and a more costeffective life-cycle management plan."

In this paper, a RM estimation method is proposed based on a deep dual learning structure. This method can simultaneously and accurately reconstruct the urban building map (UBM) and estimate the RM of the whole cell by only part of the measured reference signal receiving power (RSRP). Our proposed method implements UBM reconstruction task and RM estimation task by constructing a dual U-Net-based structure, which is named RadioCycle. RadioCycle jointly trains two symmetric generators of the dual structure. Further, to solve the problem of interference negative transfer in generators trained jointly for two different tasks, RadioCycle introduces a dynamic weighted averaging method to dynamically balance the learning rate of these two generators in the joint training. Eventually, the experiments demonstrate that on the UBM reconstruction task, RadioCycle achieves an F1 score of 0.950, and on the RM estimation task, RadioCycle achieves a root mean square error of 0.069. Therefore, RadioCycle can estimate both the RM and the UBM in a cell with measured RSRP for only 20% of the whole cell."

Binary Classification of Hypertensive Retinopathy Using Deep Dense CNN Learning,2022,"['Retinography images', 'Hypertensive-retinopathy', 'deep-neural network', 'Transfer learning', 'convolutional neural network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A condition of the retina known as hypertensive retinopathy (HR) is connected to high blood pressure. The severity and persistence of hypertension are directly correlated with the incidence of HR. To avoid blindness, it is essential to recognize and assess HR as soon as possible. Few computer-aided systems are currently available that can diagnose HR issues. On the other hand, those systems focused on gathering characteristics from a variety of retinopathy-related HR lesions and categorizing them using conventional machine-learning algorithms. Consequently, for limited applications, significant and complicated image processing methods are necessary. As seen in recent similar systems, the preciseness of classification is likewise lacking. To address these issues, a new CAD HR-diagnosis system employing the advanced Deep Dense CNN Learning (DD-CNN) technology is being developed to early identify HR. The HR-diagnosis system utilized a convolutional neural network that was previously trained as a feature extractor. The statistical investigation of more than 1400 retinography images is undertaken to assess the accuracy of the implemented system using several performance metrics such as specificity (SP), sensitivity (SE), area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), and accuracy (ACC). On average, we achieved a SE of 97%, ACC of 98%, SP of 99%, and AUC of 0.98. These results indicate that the proposed DD-CNN classifier is used to diagnose hypertensive retinopathy."
Beta and Alpha Regularizers of Mish Activation Functions for Machine Learning Applications in Deep Neural Networks,2022,"['Neural Network', 'Machine Learning Applications', 'α and β Regularizers', 'Activation Function.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A very complex task in deep learning such as image classification must be solved with the help of neural networks and activation functions. The backpropagation algorithm advances backward from the output layer towards the input layer, the gradients often get smaller and smaller and approach zero which eventually leaves the weights of the initial or lower layers nearly unchanged, as a result, the gradient descent never converges to the optimum. We propose a two-factor non-saturating activation functions known as Bea-Mish for machine learning applications in deep neural networks. Our method uses two factors, beta (β) and alpha (α), to normalize the area below the boundary in the Mish activation function and we regard these elements as Bea. Bea-Mish provide a clear understanding of the behaviors and conditions governing this regularization term can lead to a more principled approach for constructing better performing activation functions. We evaluate Bea-Mish results against Mish and Swish activation functions in various models and data sets. Empirical results show that our approach (Bea-Mish) outperforms native Mish using SqueezeNet backbone with an average precision (AP50val) of 2.51% in CIFAR-10 and top-1accuracy in ResNet-50 on ImageNet-1k. shows an improvement of 1.20%."

The development of these cracks affects both the physical and mechanical properties of the soil. This paper proposes new procedures for predicting and detecting the formation of crack patterns in expansive soils, based on customized Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning. A total of four different deep learning models are developed to detect the soil crack pattern by changing the convolution layers and hyper-parameters in the analysis. The novelty of the proposed detection methods lies in the use of customized CNN models in shrinkage crack detection for expansive soils. The customized CNN models are constructed by varying the number of convolution layers and the hyperparameters. The results show that the proposed CNN models provide very accurate results and are capable of detecting the presence of cracks in the soil with great accuracy. The best results are from one of the customized CNN models namely the Customized CNN Model 2 which consists of five convolution layers, three activation layers, one pooling layer, two fully connected layers, and a softmax layer. The results from this model are compared with other well-known approaches from the literature and are shown to provide improved results. Overall, the proposed deep learning methods developed in this paper produce excellent results in terms of the accurate detection of shrinkage soil cracks and can also be applied to other types of soil cracks."

Also landslides can cause damage at the national level, so effective prediction and prevention are essential. Research to produce a landslide susceptibility map with high accuracy is steadily being conducted, and various models have been applied to landslide susceptibility analysis. Pixel-based machine learning models such as frequency ratio models, logistic regression models, ensembles models, and Artificial Neural Networks have been mainly applied. Recent studies have shown that the kernel-based convolutional neural network (CNN) technique is effective and that the spatial characteristics of input data have a significant effect on the accuracy of landslide susceptibility mapping. For this reason, the purpose of this study is to analyze landslide vulnerability using a pixel-based deep neural network model and a patch-based convolutional neural network model.

Landslide-related factors include slope, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), timber diameter, timber age, lithology, land use, soil depth, soil parent material, lineament density, fault density, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were used. Landslide-related factors were built into a spatial database through data preprocessing, and landslide susceptibility map was predicted using deep neural network (DNN) and CNN models. The model and landslide susceptibility map were verified through average precision (AP) and root mean square errors (RMSE), and as a result of the verification, the patch-based CNN model showed 3.4% improved performance compared to the pixel-based DNN model.

Centralized Machine Learning Versus Federated Averaging: A Comparison using MNIST Dataset,2022,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Conventional machine learning', 'Deep neural network', 'Federated learning', 'and Federated averaging']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A flood of information has occurred with the rise of the internet and digital devices in the fourth industrial revolution era. Every millisecond, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data are generated; smartphones, wearable devices, sensors, and self-driving cars are just a few examples of devices that currently generate massive amounts of data in our daily. Machine learning has been considered an approach to support and recognize patterns in data in many areas to provide a convenient way to other sectors, including the healthcare sector, government sector, banks, military sector, and more. However, the conventional machine learning model requires the data owner to upload their information to train the model in one central location to perform the model training. This classical model has caused data owners to worry about the risks of transferring private information because traditional machine learning is required to push their data to the cloud to process the model training.Furthermore, the training of machine learning and deep learning models requires massive computing resources. Thus, many researchers have jumped to a new model known as ""Federated Learning"". Federated learning is emerging to train Artificial Intelligence models over distributed clients, and it provides secure privacy information to the data owner. Hence, this paper implements Federated Averaging with a Deep Neural Network to classify the handwriting image and protect the sensitive data. Moreover, we compare the centralized machine learning model with federated averaging. The result shows the centralized machine learning model outperforms federated learning in terms of accuracy, but this classical model produces another risk, like privacy concern, due to the data being stored in the data center. The MNIST dataset was used in this experiment."

The method presented in this paper constructs a dataset with a fixed labelling position for images containing objects that can be extracted from the original image, through the original image and a model that learned from it. In addition, by training the deep learning model, the performance(mAP) was improved, and the errors occurred by detecting objects other than the learning object were reduced, compared to the model in which only the original image was learned."
Synchronizing Tasks for Distributed Learning in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,2022,"['Autonomous vehicles', 'connected vehicles', 'con- tinual learning distributed learning', 'federated learning', 'model distribution', 'named data networking', 'synchronization groups.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Autonomous driving relies greatly on deep learning to comprehend the surroundings and activities of the road systems. The learning models are traditionally trained off-line and used during driving. However, recent research on feder- ated learning has enabled distributed deep learning for model adaptation with new data inputs from end users. Similarly, the recent research on continual learning has enabled the upgrading of the learned model with newer rounds of training, without losing previously acquired knowledge. For autonomous and/or connected vehicles, these mean it is possible to take new, maybe real time, data inputs from various sensors from multiple vehicles in vicinity, to train and update the preloaded models. The updated models can improve the safety and reduce human involvements when driving through unfamiliar situations. This paper tackles one important issue, namely, the model data dissemination for enabling such a distributed learning. The model data dissemination consists of steps of soliciting workers, trans- mitting model, and collecting the updates. In a mixed autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles network scenario, communication overhead and network dynamics are the major challenges. We present analyses on critical latency issues pertained to the various aspects of the model data dissemination to gain insights on the feasibility of federated learning for such a scenario. Also, we introduce a communication architecture and a publish-subscribe system for the model data dissemination. Our system is built with an information-centric networking paradigm via a tiered edge network architecture. Such a system organizes the steps of the model data dissemination clearly and manages the dynamics of the participating vehicles easily. The results show that the presented system reduces overall communication overhead and delay. It also provides high resiliency to packet losses in the mixed wireless connected and autonomous vehicular network."

However, master–slave VIR robot systems still have limitations. The operator must reside near the master device and control the slave robot using only the master device. In addition, the operator must simultaneously process the recognition of the surgical tool from the X-ray image while operating the master device. To overcome the limitations of master–slave VIR robot systems, we propose an autonomous VIR robot system with a deep learning algorithm that excludes the master device. The proposed autonomous VIR robot with a deep learning algorithm drives surgical tools to the target blood vessel location while simultaneously performing surgical tool recognition. The proposed autonomous VIR robot system detects the location of the surgical tool based on a supervised learning algorithm, and controls the surgical tools based on a reinforcement-learning algorithm. Experiments are conducted using two types of vascular phantoms to verify the effectiveness of the proposed autonomous VIR robot system. The experimental results of the vascular phantom show a comparison between the master–slave VIR robot system and the proposed autonomous VIR robot system in terms of the repulsive force, task completion time, and success rate during the operation. The proposed autonomous VIR robot system is shown to exhibit a significant reduction in repulsive force and a 96% success ratio based on a vascular phantom."

The weight values learned from the data sets can be used as initial parameters for the other desired neural networks, and additional learning can be conducted on top of the pre-learned model, called transfer learning. It is a particularly useful method when the number of data sets is and small over limited computing power environment. Four different fundus image data sets, image domains such as ethnicity of the target and equipment which the fundus photograph was captured with, were used for the validation.

In particular, the recent increase in earthquake activities has highlighted on the importance of assessing the seismic performance and predicting the seismic risk of a structure. However, the nonlinear behavior of a structure and the uncertainty in ground motion complicate the accurate seismic response prediction of a structure. Artificial intelligence can overcome these limitations to reasonably predict the nonlinear behavior of structures. In this study, a deep learning-based algorithm was developed to estimate the time-history seismic response of bridge structures. The proposed deep neural network was trained using structural and ground motion parameters. The performance of the seismic response prediction algorithm showed the similar phase and magnitude to those of the time-history analysis in a single-degree-of-freedom system that exhibits nonlinear behavior as a main structural element. Then, the proposed algorithm was expanded to predict the seismic response and fragility prediction of a bridge system.

Failure Mode Detection of Reinforced Concrete Shear Walls Using Ensemble Deep Neural Networks,2022,"['deep neural network', 'failure mode', 'shear wall', 'classification']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Reinforced concrete structural walls (RCSWs) are one of the most efficient lateral force-resisting systems used in buildings, providing sufficient strength, stiffness, and deformation capacities to withstand the forces generated during earthquake ground motions. Identifying the failure mode of the RCSWs is a critical task that can assist engineers and designers in choosing appropriate retrofitting solutions. This study evaluates the efficiency of three ensemble deep neural network models, including the model averaging ensemble, weighted average ensemble, and integrated stacking ensemble for predicting the failure mode of the RCSWs. The ensemble deep neural network models are compared against previous studies that used traditional well-known ensemble models (AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and traditional machine learning methods (Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest). The weighted average ensemble model is proposed as the best-suited prediction model for identifying the failure mode since it has the highest accuracy, precision, and recall among the alternative models. In addition, since complex and advanced machine learning-based models are commonly referred to as black-box, the SHapley Additive exPlanation method is also used to interpret the model workflow and illustrate the importance and contribution of the components that impact determining the failure mode of the RCSWs."

Meta learning-based open-set identification system for specific emitter identification in non-cooperative scenarios,2022,"['Cognitive radio', 'Specific emitter identification', 'Open-set identification system', 'Meta learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The development of wireless communication technology has led to the underutilization of radio spectra. To address this limitation, an intelligent cognitive radio network was developed. Specific emitter identification (SEI) is a key technology in this network. However, in realistic non-cooperative scenarios, the system may detect signal classes beyond those in the training database, and only a few labeled signal samples are available for network training, both of which deteriorate identification performance. To overcome these challenges, a meta-learning-based open-set identification system is proposed for SEI. First, the received signals were pre-processed using bi-spectral analysis and a Radon transform to obtain signal representation vectors, which were then fed into an open-set SEI network. This network consisted of a deep feature extractor and an intrinsic feature memorizer that can detect signals of unknown classes and classify signals of different known classes. The training loss functions and the procedures of the open-set SEI network were then designed for parameter optimization. Considering the few-shot problems of open-set SEI, meta-training loss functions and meta-training procedures that require only a few labeled signal samples were further developed for open-set SEI network training. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms other state-of-the-art SEI methods in open-set scenarios. In addition, excellent open-set SEI performance was achieved using at least 50 training signal samples, and effective operation in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments was demonstrated."

The most important consideration is that all users shouldhave the best possible satisfaction. To achieve this outcome, the matching service adds information betweenusers and items necessary for the existing recommender service and information between users, so higher-leveldata mining is required. To this end, this paper proposes a user-to-user matching service (UTU-MS) employingthe prediction of mutual satisfaction based on learning.

Specifically, each of the three vignettes presented includes a task that was implemented in an elementary classroom and a vertically articulated task that engaged teachers in a professional learning workshop. By beginning with elementary tasks to more sophisticated concepts in higher grades, we demonstrate how vertically articulating a deeper understanding of the learning trajectory in geometric thinking can add to the rigor of the mathematics."
Stable Federated Learning with Dataset Condensation,2022,"['Deep learning', 'Federated learning', 'Dataset compression', 'Class imbalance']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Federated learning (FL) is a new machine learning paradigm, where multiple clients learn their local models to collaboratively integrate into a single global model. Unlike centralized learning, the global model being integrated cannot be tested in FL as the server does not collect any data samples; further, the global model is often sent back and immediately applied to clients even in the middle of training such as Gboard. Therefore, if the performance of the global model is not stable, which is, unfortunately, the case in many FL scenarios with non-IID data, clients can be provided with an inaccurate model. This paper explores the main reason for this training instability of FL, that is, what we call temporary imbalance that happens across rounds, leading to loss of knowledge from previous rounds. To solve this problem, we propose a dataset condensation method to summarize the local data for each client without compromising on privacy. The condensed data are transmitted to the server with the local model and utilized by the server to ensure stable and consistent performance of the global model. Experimental results show that the global model not only achieves training stability but also exhibits a fast convergence speed."

An active learning method with difficulty learning mechanism for crack detection,2022,"['acquisition function', 'active learning', 'crack detection', 'probability attention module', 'semantic segmentation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Crack detection is essential for inspection of existing structures and crack segmentation based on deep learning is asignificant solution. However, datasets are usually one of the key issues. When building a new dataset for deep learning, laborious and time-consuming annotation of a large number of crack images is an obstacle. The aim of this study is to develop an approach that can automatically select a small portion of the most informative crack images from a large pool in order to annotate them, not to label all crack images. An active learning method with difficulty learning mechanism for crack segmentation tasks is proposed. Experiments are carried out on a crack image dataset of a steel box girder, which contains 500 images of 320 × 320 size for training, 100 for validation, and 190 for testing. In active learning experiments, the 500 images for training are acted as unlabeled image. The acquisition function in our method is compared with traditional acquisition functions, i.e., Query-By-Committee (QBC), Entropy, and Core-set. Further, comparisons are made on four common segmentation networks: U-Net, DeepLabV3, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and PSPNet. The results show that when training occurs with 200 (40%) of the most informative crack images that are selected by our method, the four segmentation networks can achieve 92%-95% of the obtained performance when training takes place with 500 (100%) crack images. The acquisition function in our method shows more accurate measurements of informativeness for unlabeled crack images compared to the four traditional acquisition functions at most active learning stages. Our method can select the most informative images for annotation from many unlabeled crack images automatically and accurately. Additionally, the dataset built after selecting 40% of all crack images can support crack segmentation networks that perform more than 92% when all the images are used."
Semi-Supervised Imitation Learning with Mixed Qualities of Demonstrations for Autonomous Driving,2022,"['Autonomous driving', 'Deep learning', 'Imitation learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we consider the problem of autonomous driving using imitation learning in a semi-supervised manner. In particular, both labeled and unlabeled demonstrations are leveraged during training by estimating the quality of each unlabeled demonstration. If the provided demonstrations are corrupted and have a low signal-to-noise ratio, the performance of the imitation learning agent can be degraded significantly. To mitigate this problem, we propose a method called semi-supervised imitation learning (SSIL). SSIL first learns how to discriminate and evaluate each state-action pair’s reliability in unlabeled demonstrations by assigning higher reliability values to demonstrations similar to labeled expert demonstrations. This reliability value is called leverage. After this discrimination process, labeled and unlabeled demonstrations with estimated leverage values are utilized while training the policy in a semi-supervised manner. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm using unlabeled trajectories with mixed qualities. Moreover, the hardware experiments using an RC car are conducted to show that the proposed method can be applied to real-world applications."

In the SelfDeblur method, two neural networks for an image generator and a blur kernel generator are learned simultaneously with only one blurry image. This shows the feasibility of blind image deblurring using unsupervised learning, since it requires no training process. In this paper, we propose a method to maximize the performance of blind image deblurring based on DIP. The optimal loss function for deep learning is studied for the SelfDeblur method, and the deblurring performance of the proposed method is stabilized and maximized using the image prior and the kernel prior for the total loss function.

Unsupervised Transfer Learning for Plant Anomaly Recognition,2022,"['Plant Disease Recognition', 'Unsupervised Transfer Learning', 'Plant Village Dataset', 'Vision Transformer']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Disease threatens plant growth and recognizing the type of disease is essential to making a remedy. In recent years, deep learning has witnessed a significant improvement for this task, however, a large volume of labeled images is one of the requirements to get decent performance. But annotated images are difficult and expensive to obtain in the agricultural field. Therefore, designing an efficient and effective strategy is one of the challenges in this area with few labeled data. Transfer learning, assuming taking knowledge from a source domain to a target domain, is borrowed to address this issue and observed comparable results. However, current transfer learning strategies can be regarded as a supervised method as it hypothesizes that there are many labeled images in a source domain. In contrast, unsupervised transfer learning, using only images in a source domain, gives more convenience as collecting images is much easier than annotating. In this paper, we leverage unsupervised transfer learning to perform plant disease recognition, by which we achieve a better performance than supervised transfer learning in many cases. Besides, a vision transformer with a bigger model capacity than convolution is utilized to have a better-pretrained feature space. With the vision transformer-based unsupervised transfer learning, we achieve better results than current works in two datasets. Especially, we obtain 97.3% accuracy with only 30 training images for each class in the Plant Village dataset. We hope that our work can encourage the community to pay attention to vision transformer-based unsupervised transfer learning in the agricultural field when with few labeled images."

The day-ahead system marginal price determines electricity prices, and system marginal price forecasting is critical in maintaining energy management systems. There have been several studies using mathematics and machine learning models to forecast the system marginal price, but few studies have been conducted to develop, compare, and analyze various machine learning and deep learning models based on a data-driven framework. Therefore, in this study, different machine learning algorithms (i.e., autoregressive-based models such as the autoregressive integrated moving average model) and deep learning networks (i.e., recurrent neural network-based models such as the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit model) are considered and integrated evaluation metrics including a forecasting test and information criteria are proposed to discern the optimal forecasting model. A case study of South Korea using long-term time-series system marginal price data from 2016 to 2021 was applied to the developed framework. The results of the study indicate that the autoregressive integrated moving average model (R-squared score: 0.97) and the gated recurrent unit model (R-squared score: 0.94) are appropriate for system marginal price forecasting. This study is expected to contribute significantly to energy management systems and the suggested framework can be explicitly applied for renewable energy networks."

SVM on Top of Deep Networks for Covid-19 Detection from Chest X-ray Images,2022,"['Covid-19', 'X-ray image', 'Deep learning', 'Support vector machines']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this study, we propose training a support vector machine (SVM) model on top of deep networks for detecting Covid-19 from chest X-ray images. We started by gathering a real chest X-ray image dataset, including positive Covid-19, normal cases, and other lung diseases not caused by Covid-19. Instead of training deep networks from scratch, we fine-tuned recent pre-trained deep network models, such as DenseNet121, MobileNet v2, Inception v3, Xception, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19, to classify chest X-ray images into one of three classes (Covid-19, normal, and other lung).

Comparative study on reduced models of unsteady aerodynamics using proper orthogonal decomposition and deep neural network,2022,"['Computational fluid dynamics', 'Reduced order model', 'Non-intrusive proportional orthogonal decomposition', 'Deep neural network', 'Unsteady flow', 'Machine learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Data-driven researches based on various machine learning techniques, are being actively explored in science and technology areas. In the area of computational fluid dynamics, several studies have already been conducted in a reduced order modeling technique using principal orthogonal basis called proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Recently the application of machine learning techniques represented by deep learning or deep neural network (DNN) to the existing reduced order model methods is increasingly drawing attention with the development of processor hardware technology such as GPU. This study, based on the data produced by a state-of-the-art flow solver, examined both POD and DNN techniques to three different methods: a) classical non-intrusive POD with local linear regression, b) fully-connected DNN, and c) mixed POD-DNN. Method a) and c) have difference in computing superposed time expansion coefficients. The target problem is unsteady aerodynamic simulation of a two dimensional airfoil with fixed angle-of-attack and three grid and flow condition sets: (structured grid, inviscid flow, Mach 0.2), (structured grid, turbulent flow, Mach 0.6, Reynolds 1x10 5 ), and (unstructured grid, laminar flow, Mach 0.4). The comparison items were flow fields of velocity/pressure for all cases and aerodynamic lift/drag performances only for the structured grid system respectively. In these computations the overall tendencies of aerodynamic lift and drag are similar, but the POD with existing local linear regression method in calculating time coefficients was found to show the highly robust and moderately accurate predictions. The direct DNN method was judged to be able to be used as a feasible reduced order model since it overcomes linearity error at both extracting POD basis and determining coefficients and has an advantage to be able to infer flow variables in arbitrary spatial locations. It showed better level of error than the classical POD method, but had model optimization cost to tune hyper-parameters and determine how many training data should be obtained to mitigate partial error. As an intermediate way, the mixed POD-DNN provided a robust reduced model of airfoil aerodynamic simulation due to the moderate computational cost and better accuracy comparing to the two other methods, but it had a shortcoming of fixed spatial coordinates like the classical POD method because the POD basis has fixed dimension of vector. In conclusion, fully-connected deep neural network method is helpful to predict flow field distribution as a universal field approximator in accordance with time and space such as fluid field simulation in this study, and, what is better, using POD basis will augment the accuracy and computational efficiency."

The methods based on deep learning are promising because they can extract fault features and conduct fault diagnosis effectively.

To address these problems, we, inspired by semi-supervised learning, proposed a semi-supervised charging equipment fault diagnosis method combining Tri-training and deep belief network (DBN). The proposed method adopts Tri-training to enable full utilization of unlabeled data of charging equipment, and obtain a large amount of valid pseudo-labeled data, which will be used for the training of Tri-DBN model. Subsequently, the fault features of charging equipment are input into Tri-DBN, which is used for the classification and identification of charging equipment faults.

In addition, this method still performs well in the presence of less labeled data."
Structural health monitoring response reconstruction based on UAGAN under structural condition variations with few-shot learning,2022,"['deep learning', 'few-shot learning', 'self-attention', 'structural health monitoring', 'structure response reconstruction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Inevitable response loss under complex operational conditions significantly affects the integrity and quality of measured data, leading the structural health monitoring (SHM) ineffective. To remedy the impact of data loss, a common way is to transfer the recorded response of available measure point to where the data loss occurred by establishing the response mapping from measured data. However, the current research has yet addressed the structural condition changes afterward and response mapping learning from a small sample. So, this paper proposes a novel data driven structural response reconstruction method based on a sophisticated designed generating adversarial network (UAGAN). Advanced deep learning techniques including U-shaped dense blocks, self-attention and a customized loss function are specialized and embedded in UAGAN to improve the universal and representative features extraction and generalized responses mapping establishment. In numerical validation, UAGAN efficiently and accurately captures the distinguished features of structural response from only 40 training samples of the intact structure. Besides, the established response mapping is universal, which effectively reconstructs responses of the structure suffered up to 10% random stiffness reduction or structural damage. In the experimental validation, UAGAN is trained with ambient response and applied to reconstruct response measured under earthquake. The reconstruction losses of response in the time and frequency domains reached 16% and 17%, that is better than the previous research, demonstrating the leading performance of the sophisticated designed network. In addition, the identified modal parameters from reconstructed and the corresponding true responses are highly consistent indicates that the proposed UAGAN is very potential to be applied to practical civil engineering."

The proposed model and optimization technique achieved offline accuracy of 92.19 % and 94.29 % for the raw and STFT input, respectively. However, the on-device accuracy for raw and STFT input to the model was 82.26 % and 85.19 %, respectively. On the other hand, the adaptive model update increased the respective accuracy by an average of 7% on-device. Finally, our study demonstrates the deployment of DNN on-device for real-time gesture classification inference."

Explicit Dynamic Coordination Reinforcement Learning Based on Utility,2022,"['Reinforcement Learning', 'Multi-agent System', 'Explicit Coordination Learning', 'Utility Dependence', 'Intelligent Vehicle']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Multi-agent systems often need to achieve the goal of learning more effectively for a task through coordination. Although the introduction of deep learning has addressed the state space problems, multi-agent learning remains infeasible because of the joint action spaces. Large-scale joint action spaces can be sparse according to implicit or explicit coordination structure, which can ensure reasonable coordination action through the coordination structure. In general, the multi-agent system is dynamic, which makes the relations among agents and the coordination structure are dynamic. Therefore, the explicit coordination structure can better represent the coordinative relationship among agents and achieve better coordination between agents. Inspired by the maximization of social group utility, we dynamically construct a factor graph as an explicit coordination structure to express the coordinative relationship according to the utility among agents and estimate the joint action values based on the local utility transfer among factor graphs. We present the application of such techniques in the scenario of multiple intelligent vehicle systems, where state space and action space are a problem and have too many interactions among agents. The results on the multiple intelligent vehicle systems demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods."

Followed by which, the input layer transmits sensor nodes to first hidden layer where analysis of energy consumption, bandwidth consumption and light intensity are made using kriging regression function to perform classification. According to classified results, sensor nodes are classified into higher performance and lower performance sensor nodes. The higher performance sensor nodes are then transmitted to second hidden layer. Here high performance sensor nodes neighbouring sensor with higher signal strength and frequency are selected and sent to the output layer where the actual data packet transmission is performed. Experimental evaluation is carried out on factors such as energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, packet loss rate and end-to-end delay with respect to number of patient data packets and sensor nodes."

A wind tunnel test was performed to increase the accuracy of the Gazebo simulation by utilizing high-fidelity propulsion data of the KP-1’s motors. The effectiveness of the adopted control framework is compared with linear quadratic regulator (LQR) which is also the initial control of es-DNLC before training.

Bi-directional evolutionary 3D topology optimization with a deep neural network,2022,"['Topology optimization', 'Deep learning', 'BESO', 'CNN', 'Python']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The FEM-based topology optimization repeats usually finite element analyses many times to converge to the stopping criteria. If the near-optimal topology data are available in advance at the beginning of an optimization process, the iterative computation could be greatly reduced. In an effort to obtain swiftly optimum topology solutions, the deep learning and neural networks with a special segmentation scheme of digital images are combined with the BESO (bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization) topology method in this study. The pre-trained digital images of 3200 optimum topologies construct the design domain for the main topology optimization. Additionally, a new post-processor is developed in order to reconstruct the relative locations among finite elements in the raw outputs generated by the neural network.The proposed method has been demonstrated to be efficient in lowering the iterations with several 2D and 3D optimization examples. The iteration counts can be reduced 63 % for a 2D example and by 72.5 % for a 3D one, compared to BESO results alone."

Recent research has demonstrated that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective at extracting features due to their strong feature extraction capabilities. In order to improve classification performance, these approaches rely primarily on semantic information. Since the abstract and global semantic information makes it difficult for the network to correctly classify scene images with similar structures and high interclass similarity, it achieves a low classification accuracy. We propose a VHR remote sensing image classification model that uses extracts the global feature from the original VHR image using an EfficientNet-V2L CNN pre-trained to detect similar classes.

An end-to-end cascaded framework is proposed to first detect the existence of cracks using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and then segment the crack using a modified U-Net encoder-decoder architecture. A Naive Bayes data fusion scheme is proposed to reduce the false positives and false negatives effectively. To generate the binary crack mask, first, the original images are divided into 448 × 448 overlapping image patches where these image patches are classified as cracks versus non-cracks using a deep CNN. Next, a modified U-Net is trained from scratch using only the crack patches for segmentation. A customized loss function that consists of binary cross entropy loss and the Dice loss is introduced to enhance the segmentation performance. Additionally, a Naive Bayes fusion strategy is employed to integrate the crack score maps from different overlapping crack patches and to decide whether a pixel is crack or not. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves an 81.71% mean intersection over union (mIoU) score across 5 different training/test splits, which is 7.29% higher than the baseline reference implemented with the original U-Net."

This paper proposes an algorithm that combines the dynamic window approach (DWA) and deep reinforcement learning to build a velocity model to avoid obstacles. This method adds and subtracts the linear and angular velocities of the robot from the DWA calculations using the designed learning module. Through this configuration, many robotic motions can be generated even with limited action functions. In our experiments, the application of this learning module showed a 23.7% higher rate of obstacle avoidance than with DWA alone. The experimental results verified that the proposed method improved the performance of obstacle avoidance for multiple dynamic environments without any additional work. It has been confirmed that this method can be applied to real robots as well."

However, there are limitations in establishing an optimized long-term plan because the workload balancing takes too much time due to the size and the complexity of the problem domain. Most shipyards currently overcome the limitations by dividing the long-term planning into two-phase of the berth planning and the capacity planning. The berth planning is being conducted with a heuristic method by considering some rules such as the berth priority and the closeness to delivery date. Then it is followed by the capacity planning, in which the workload data is considered for the workload balancing with the previously planned data. However, the heuristic method has a fundamental problems that the optimized solution is not guaranteed owing to the limits of the search range. Also, the previous production record cannot reflect the newly ordered vessel's workload precisely.

Thus, researchers pay attention to the need for surface defects detector and the deep learning methods are the current trend of object detector. There are still limitations and rooms for improvements, for example, related works focus on developing the models but don’t take into account real-time application with practical implication on industrial settings. In this paper, a real-time application of steel surface defects detection based on YOLOv4 is proposed. Firstly, as the aim of this work to deploying model on real-time application, we studied related works on this field, particularly focusing on one-stage detector and YOLO algorithm, which is one of the most famous algorithm for real-time object detectors. Secondly, using pre-trained Yolov4-Darknet platform models and transfer learning, we trained and test on the hot rolled steel defects open-source dataset NEU-DET. In our study, we applied our application with 4 types of typical defects of a steel surface, namely patches, pitted surface, inclusion and scratches.Thirdly, we evaluated YOLOv4 trained model real-time performance to deploying our system with accuracy of 87.1 % mAP@0.5 and over 60 fps with GPU processing."

Therefore, in order to reduce safety accidents at industrial fields, workers are required to wear personal protective equipment. In this paper, we proposes a method to automatically check whether workers are wearing safety helmets among the protective equipment in the industrial field. It detects whether or not the helmet is worn using YOLOv5, a computer vision-based deep learning object detection algorithm. We transfer learning the s model among Yolov5 models with different learning rates and epochs, evaluate the performance, and select the optimal model. The selected model showed a performance of 0.959 mAP."

For the corresponding engineering design, it is very essential and crucial to monitor flow patterns and their transitions accurately.With the high-speed development and success of deep learning based on convolutional neural network (CNN), the study of flow pattern identification recently almost focused on this methodology. Additionally, the photographing technique has attractive implementation features as well, since it is normally considerably less expensive than other techniques. The development of such a two-phase flow pattern online monitoring system is the objective of this work, which seldom studied before. The ongoing preliminary engineering design (including hardware and software) of the system are introduced. The flow pattern identification method based on CNNs and transfer learning was discussed in detail. Several potential CNN candidates such as ALexNet, VggNet16 and ResNets were introduced and compared with each other based on a flow pattern dataset. According to the results, ResNet50 is the most promising CNN network for the system owing to its high precision, fast classification and strong robustness. This work can be a reference for the online monitoring system design in the energy system."

Adaptive low-resolution palmprint image recognition based on channel attention mechanism and modified deep residual network,2022,"['Deep learning', 'Low-resolution palmprint recognition', 'attention mechanism']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Palmprint recognition has drawn increasingly attentions in the past decade due to its uniqueness and reliability. Traditional palmprint recognition methods usually use high-resolution images as the identification basis so that they can achieve relatively high precision. However, high-resolution images mean more computation cost in the recognition process, which usually cannot be guaranteed in mobile computing. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved low-resolution palmprint image recognition method based on residual networks. The main contributions include: 1) We introduce a channel attention mechanism to refactor the extracted feature maps, which can pay more attention to the informative feature maps and suppress the useless ones. 2) The ResStage group structure proposed by us divides the original residual block into three stages, and we stabilize the signal characteristics before each stage by means of BN normalization operation to enhance the feature channel. Comparison experiments are conducted on a public dataset provided by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieve a rank-1 accuracy of 98.17% when tested on low-resolution images with the size of 12dpi, which outperforms all the compared methods obviously."

Textual information is learned through a designed loss function utilizing a pre-generated texture map to distinguish textual areas from flat areas. In the training process, the proposed network internally finds texture and flat regions and differs in denoising strength in the two regions.Unlike existing DNN-based denoising methods, the proposed method retains high-frequency textual information while removing residual noise in flat regions as much as possible. The gradient distribution of the image before and after the denoising was compared. The proposed method outperformed the existing methods with higher PSNR and SSIM scores in visual quality. In addition, the strength of removing textual noise was controllable with a single parameter. Thus, the proposed method is practically feasible as a denoising apparatus."
Deep Facade Parsing with Occlusions,2022,"['Facade parsing', 'occlusion', 'repetitive pattern', 'man-made structure']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Correct facade image parsing is essential to the semantic understanding of outdoor scenes. Unfortunately, there are often various occlusions in front of buildings, which fails many existing methods. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep network for facade parsing with occlusions. The network learns to decompose an input image into visible and invisible parts by occlusion reasoning. Then, a context aggregation module is proposed to collect nonlocal cues for semantic segmentation of the visible part. In addition, considering the regularity of man-made buildings, a repetitive pattern completion branch is designed to infer the contents in the invisible regions by referring to the visible part. Finally, the parsing map of the input facade image is generated by fusing the results of the visible and invisible results. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in parsing facades with occlusions. Moreover, we applied our method in applications of image inpainting and 3D semantic modeling."

Dexterous and precise grasp control of the robotic arm is challenging and a critical technique for the manufacturing and emerging robot service industry. Current state-of-art methods adopt RGB-D images or point clouds in an attempt to obtain an accurate, robust, and real-time policy. However, most of these methods only use single modal data or ignore the uncertainty of sampling data especially the depth information. Even they leverage multi-modal data, they seldom fuse the features in different scales. All of these results in unreliable grasp prediction inevitably. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal neural network to predict grasps in real-time. The key idea is to fuse RGB and depth information hierarchically and quantify the uncertainty of raw depth data to re-weight the depth features. For higher grasping performance, a background extraction module and depth re-estimation module are used to reduce the influence caused by the incompletion and low-quality of the raw data. We evaluate the performance on the Cornell Grasp Dataset and provide a series of extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of our method on a real robot. The results indicate the superiority of our proposed method by outperforming the state-of-the-art methods significantly in all metrics."

Especially for underground engineering, complex geological conditions make the structure more prone to disasters. Aiming at solving the problems existing in previous studies, such as incomplete consideration factors and can only predict the continuous performance, the deep attention fused temporal convolution network (DATCN) is proposed in this paper to predict the spatial mechanical behaviors of structure, which integrates both the temporal effect and spatial effect and realize the cross-time prediction. The temporal convolution network (TCN) and self-attention mechanism are employed to learn the temporal correlation of each monitoring point and the spatial correlation among different points, respectively. Then, the predicted result obtained from DATCN is compared with that obtained from some classical baselines, including SVR, LR, MLP, and RNNs. Also, the parameters involved in DATCN are discussed to optimize the prediction ability. The prediction result demonstrates that the proposed DATCN model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. The prediction accuracy of DATCN model after 24 hours reaches 90 percent. Also, the performance in last 14 hours plays a domain role to predict the short-term behaviors of the structure.

Functional movement screen (FMS) test were implemented before and after training intervention to compare the scores for each task and the total score. As a result of the study, among the seven tasks of the FMS test, we confirmed the significant effect of core stabilization training for 8 weeks in deep squats, in-line lunge, and rotary stability tasks and total score. Tasks that showed significant changes among the FMS test can be performed through balance and posture control ability based on strength, flexibility, and coordination of muscles around the spine and pelvis.

Firstly, the instantaneous parameters of the vibration responses are obtained by the discrete analytical mode decomposition (DAMD) method and the Hilbert transform (HT). The instantaneous parameters are regarded as the independent variables, and the nonlinear model parameters are considered as the dependent variables. Then the DBN is utilized for approximating the nonlinear mapping relationship between them. At last, the instantaneous parameters of the measured vibration responses are fed into the well-trained DBN. Owing to the strong learning and generalization abilities of the DBN, the updated nonlinear model parameters can be directly estimated. Two nonlinear shear-type structure models under two types of excitation and various noise levels are adopted as numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The nonlinear properties of the structure model are simulated via the hysteretic parameters of a Bouc-Wen model and a Giuffré- Menegotto-Pinto model, respectively. Besides, the proposed approach is verified by a three-story shear-type frame with a piezoelectric friction damper (PFD). Simulated and experimental results suggest that the nonlinear model updating approach has high computational efficiency and precision."

In this study, we employ a residual U-Net for the segmentation of basal ganglia EPVS from MRI. To assist the network’s learning in EPVS delineation, we inputted multiple MRI modality sequences to diversify the radiographic features of the EPVS provided for network training. We evaluated our method using the in-house dataset. Results show that the predicted segmentation from our network does not strictly agree with the ground truth on a pixel-by-pixel basis, however, that our method can well identify true EPVSs and has the potential for the clinical purposes of EPVS detection and quantification."

Meanwhile, the general guidelines provided by the IAEA or top-tier regulatory requirements addressed by each country do not mention detailed methods of ‘how to develop scenarios by combining individual FEPs’. For this reason, the overall frameworks of developing scenarios are almost similar, but their details are quite different depending on situation.

The Effects of Group Art Therapy on the Learned Helplessness and Career Decision Making Self-Efficacy of Mentally Challenged High School Students,2022,"['Group Art Therapy', 'Learned Helplessness', 'Career Decision Making', 'Self-Efficacy', 'Mentally Challenged']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: The career decision-making self-efficacy is a belief about an individual's ability to successfully ac-complish a given task. Students do not demonstrate an active attitude when they are faced with various stresses and anxiety about their own career or employment, and even some are passive and self-reliant, and they learn throughout their lives by becoming helpless when faced with numerous challenges due to their lack of responsi-bility or low self-esteem, thereby demonstrating symptoms of learned helplessness. As a result of the study which identified the relationship between learned helplessness and career path, the students with a high level of learned helplessness had a relatively high percentage of independent and dependent decisions in the overall process such as career selection, search, and decision relative to the students with a low sense of helplessness, and it was also claimed that the children with high learned helplessness showed relatively low means to solve career-related problem situations promptly. Hence, it is evident that by conducting the group art therapy, negative cognition and behavior can be changed through the group interaction and successful expe-riences in the art therapy process. This paper seeks to specifically examine the effects of group art therapy, which is very useful among the various treatment techniques which can help solve internal problems, on the learned helplessness and career decision making self-efficacy formed through the repeated failures.Method: Twenty mentally challenged high school students enrolled in special classes at average high schools were assigned to the experimental group and 10 to the control group. The group program was conducted twice a week, for a total of 10 sessions of 80 minutes per session. For the pre-post-additional-tests on learned helpless-ness and career decision making self-efficacy, repeated measure analysis of variance and simple main effect analysis were performed.Results: The experimental group in receipt of the group art therapy program was statistically significantly higher in the learned helplessness and career decision making self-efficacy scores than the control group both after and additional. Such results are meaning in that they help not only the mentally challenged high school students who are about to graduate, but also the mentally challenged high school students currently enrolled in the school to increase their self-confidence and self-esteem to ensure that they can make career choices that align with the reality through the positive understanding of themselves and the correct perception related changes.Conclusion: The group art therapy helps to address issues and problems through deep insight into one's inner self, and helps to improve the self-esteem by having a positive self-image, further to being an important factor for improvement. Hence, through this study, the group art therapy program should make an active effort to give a sense of achievement for the human growth, convert negative motives to positive motives, and diversify the scope of application of group art therapy programs for addressing realistic problems."

Group art therapy has the characteristic that art activities help promote emotional expression that has been suppressed in the past, and self-exposure and self-understanding are actively presented in the group. group art therapy helps the subject to have a deep insight into his or her inner self to solve problems and build a positive self-image. As a result of examining the programs related to learned helplessness, efforts on measures to reduce helplessness could be found. By conducting group art therapy on learned helplessness and self-leadership, we tried to change negative perceptions and behaviors and increase positive views through group interactions and successful experiences in the art therapy process to help rational decision-making. As such, the purpose of this study is to provide basic data on a counseling approach that gives a sense of accomplishment and converts negative moti-vation into positive motivation to reduce learned helplessness and improve self-leadership through group art therapy programs. Method: Based on the results of the basic research, major variables and related programs related to the learned helplessness and self-leadership of college students were analyzed through various literature and previ-ous research data and reflected in the preliminary program. A preliminary program was conducted to secure empirical evidence for the revision and improvement of the group art therapy program organized according to the program procedure to understand the acceptance of participants and the effectiveness of the program.

Therefore, it is crucial to detect underground cavities in advance and repair them. Underground cavity detection is mainly performed using ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys. This process is time-consuming, as a massive amount of GPR data needs to be interpreted, and the results vary depending on the skills and subjectivity of experts. To address these problems, researchers have studied automation and quantification techniques for GPR data interpretation, and recent studies have focused on deep learning-based interpretation techniques. In this study, we described a hyperbolic event detection process based on deep learning for GPR data interpretation. To demonstrate this process, we implemented a series of algorithms introduced in the preexisting research step by step. First, a deep learning-based YOLOv3 object detection model was applied to automatically detect hyperbolic signals. Subsequently, only hyperbolic signals were extracted using the column-connection clustering (C3) algorithm. Finally, the horizontal locations of the underground cavities were determined using regression analysis. The hyperbolic event detection using the YOLOv3 object detection technique achieved 84% precision and a recall score of 92% based on AP50. The predicted horizontal locations of the four underground cavities were approximately 0.12 ~ 0.36 m away from their actual locations. Thus, we confirmed that the existing deep learning-based interpretation technique is reliable with regard to detecting the hyperbolic patterns indicating underground cavities."

Therefore, SST prediction has been always an important issue. Recently, deep learning has drawn much attentions, since it can predict SST by training past SST patterns. Compared to the numerical simulations, deep learning model is highly efficient, since it can estimate nonlinear relationships between input data. With the recent development of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in computer, large amounts of data can be calculated repeatedly and rapidly. In this study, Short-term SST will be predicted through Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based U-Net that can handle spatiotemporal data concurrently and overcome the drawbacks of previously existing deep learning-based models. The SST prediction performance depends on the seasonal and interannual SST variabilities around the southern coast of Korea. The predicted SST has a wide range of variance during spring and summer, while it has small range of variance during fall and winter. A wide range of variance also has a significant correlation with the change of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index. These results are found to be affected by the intensity of the seasonal and PDO-related interannual SST fronts and their intensity variations along the southern Korean seas. This study implies that the SST prediction performance using the developed deep learning model can be significantly varied by seasonal and interannual variabilities in SST."

Also, the importance of precision agriculture has been growing in recent years. Notably, yield monitoring is an important precision agricultural technology of increasing interest that can be used in variable fertilization, supply/demand control, etc. However, yield monitoring research is not conducted actively in South Korea compared to other countries, such as the United States and Japan. Hence, this research developed a potato yield monitoring system to count the potatoes harvested by a potato harvester. In particular, this system used machine vision and a deep learning algorithm. First, the YOLOv5 object detection model identified the potatoes and other substances, such as stone, soil, and potato plant stem, on the potato harvester's conveyor. Further, each harvested potato identified by the YOLOv5 object detection model was assigned a unique ID by the DeepSORT deep learning algorithm to trace the harvested potatoes. Finally, these harvested potatoes were counted when they arrived at a certain point on the potato harvester's conveyor. A performance test on this potato yield monitoring system's YOLOv5 object detection model showed that this model had a precision, recall, mAP, and F1 score of 0.9997, 0.9994, 0.9872, and 0.9996, respectively.

Stacked long short-term memory (stacked-LSTM), a deep learning technique suitable for time series forecasting, was used for model development. Daily time series data from 2001 to 2022 for precipitation, groundwater usage amount, and groundwater level were considered. Various models were proposed that used different combinations of the input data types and varying lengths of previous time series data for each input variable. A general procedure for deep-learning-based model development is suggested based on consideration of the comparative validation results of the tested models. A model using precipitation, groundwater usage amount, and previous groundwater level data as input variables outperformed any model neglecting one or more of these data categories. Using extended sequences of these past data improved the predictions, possibly owing to the long delay time between precipitation and groundwater recharge, which results from the deep groundwater level in Jeju Island. However, limiting the range of considered groundwater usage data that significantly affected the groundwater level fluctuation (rather than using all the groundwater usage data) improved the performance of the predictive model. The developed models can predict the future groundwater level based on the current amount of precipitation and groundwater use. Therefore, the models provide information on the soundness of the aquifer system, which will help to prepare management plans to maintain appropriate groundwater quantities."

However, most computational approaches to studying the viral genome are based on the frequencies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) since the large size of the genomic sequence makes it almost impossible to encode the information of the whole genome at once. In this study, we introduce an alternative embedding strategy to extract information from the SARS-CoV2 whole genome using the density-based clustering algorithm MUTCLUST and deep learning. We first reduced the size of the genome by identifying densely mutated clusters as important regions using MUTCLUST. We then learned the subtype-specific embedding vectors from the extracted clusters using a sequence convolutional deep learning model. We found that the learned embeddings contained information that could be used to discriminate known subtypes and reconstruct phylogenetic trees."

However, it is not easy to apply accurate IoT data immediately as IoT data collected according to network environment (interference, interference, etc.) are frequently missed or error occurs. In order to minimize mistakes in IoT data collected in an edge network environment, this paper proposes a management technique that ensures the reliability of IoT data by randomly generating signature values of IoT data and allocating only Security Information (SI) values to IoT data in bit form. The proposed technique binds IoT data into a blockchain by applying multiple hash chains to asymmetrically link and process data collected from IoT devices. In this case, the blockchainized IoT data uses a probability function to which a weight is applied according to a correlation index based on deep learning. In addition, the proposed technique can expand and operate grouped IoT data into an n-layer structure to lower the integrity and processing cost of IoT data."

Among these studies, the latest studies have attempted to predict stock prices using limit order books, which contain buy and sell order information of stocks. However, most of the studies using limit order books consider only the trend of limit order books over the most recent period of a specified length, and few studies consider both the medium and short term trends of limit order books. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based prediction model that predicts stock price more accurately by considering both the medium and short term trends of limit order books. Moreover, the proposed model considers news headlines during the same period to reflect the qualitative status of the company in the stock price prediction. The proposed model extracts the features of changes in limit order books with CNNs and the features of news headlines using Word2vec, and combines these information to predict whether a particular company’s stock will rise or fall the next day. We conducted experiments to predict the daily stock price fluctuations of five stocks (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Tesla) with the proposed model using the real NASDAQ limit order book data and news headline data, and the proposed model improved the accuracy by up to 17.66%p and the average by 14.47%p on average.

Existing recommender systems face important problems in practical applications. The most important problem is that it cannot clearly explain why it recommends these products. In recent years, some researchers have found that the explanation of recommender systems may be very useful. As a result, users are generally increasing conversion rates, satisfaction, and trust in the recommender system if it is explained why those particular items are recommended. Therefore, this study presents a methodology of providing an explanatory function of a recommender system using a review text left by a user. The basic idea is not to use all of the user's reviews, but to provide them in a summarized form using only reviews left by similar users or neighbors involved in recommending the item as an explanation when providing the recommended item to the user. To achieve this research goal, this study aims to provide a product recommendation list using user-based collaborative filtering techniques, combine reviews left by neighboring users with each product to build a model that combines text summary methods among deep learning-based natural language processing methods.

However, due to neurological diseases reducing SNR, C-spine MRI examination has the disadvantage of enhancing the intensity of the background signal. Increasing the number of excitations to compensate for this results in longer examination time. When conducting C-spine MRI examination due to traffic accidents or falls, the optimal image can be obtained only when breathing and movement caused by pain are minimized; hence, the active cooperation of patients is required, and examination time needs to be reduced to produce diagnostic images without artifacts. Fortunately, the recently developed SwiftMR artificial intelligence software can dramatically reduce C-spine MRI examination time. SNR of sagittal T2WI, axial T2WI, sagittal T1WI and axial T1WI SwiftMR images were measured as vertebra body 223.82 ± 30.82, spine cord 273.03 ± 32.38, and spines and transverse process 378.61 ± 27.64. The SNR of the turbo spin echo technique was measured as vertebra body 116.51 ± 11.46, spine cord 182.1 ± 22.24, and spines and transverse process 227.79 ± 35.55. The CNR of the turbo spin echo technique was measured as 182.12 ± 13.24 and the CNR of the SwiftMR technique was measured as 346.8 ± 41.84. Through images applied with turbo spin echo and SwiftMR artificial intelligence software, the K value was evaluated as 0.87 with respect to the consistency of image quality clarity, signal strength uniformity, and lesions between observers of artifacts around the vertebra body. The results thus indicate that C-spine MRI examination time can be shortened by applying the SwiftMR artificial intelligence technique, minimizing patient inconvenience and providing diagnostic quality image information."

To express more effectively what the brand wants to convey through design, the printing market is striving to print accurate colors that match the intention. In ‘offset printing’ mainly used in printing, colors are often printed in CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key) colors. However, it is possible to print more accurate colors by making ink of the desired color instead of dotting CMYK colors. The resulting ink is called ‘spot color’ ink. Spot color ink is manufactured by repeating the process of mixing the existing inks. In this repetition of trial and error, the manufacturing cost of ink increases, resulting in economic loss, and environmental pollution is caused by wasted inks.In this study, a deep learning algorithm to predict printed spot colors was designed to solve this problem. The algorithm uses a single DNN (Deep Neural Network) model to predict printed spot colors based on the information of the paper and the proportions of inks to mix. More than 8,000 spot color ink data were used for learning, and all color was quantified by dividing the visible light wavelength range into 31 sections and the reflectance for each section.The proposed algorithm predicted more than 80% of spot color inks as very similar colors. The average value of the calculated difference between the actual color and the predicted color through ‘Delta E’ provided by CIE is 5.29. It is known that when Delta E is less than 10, it is difficult to distinguish the difference in printed color with the naked eye. The algorithm of this study has a more accurate prediction ability than previous studies, and it can be added flexibly even when new inks are added. This can be usefully used in real industrial sites, and it will reduce the attempts of the operator by checking the color of ink in a virtual environment. This will reduce the manufacturing cost of spot color inks and lead to improved working conditions for workers. In addition, it is expected to contribute to solving the environmental pollution problem by reducing unnecessarily wasted ink."

The label data was divided into five tree species (Pinus densiflora, Pinus koraiensis, Larix kaempferi, Abies holophylla Maxim. and Quercus) by visually interpreting the divided image, and then labeling was performed manually. The dataset constructed a total of 2,429 images, of which about 85% was used as learning data and about 15% as verification data. As a result of classification using the deep learning model, the overall accuracy of up to 78% was achieved when using the Worldview-3 image, the accuracy of up to 84% when using the GeoEye-1 image, and the classification accuracy was high performance. In particular, Quercus showed high accuracy of more than 85% in F<sub>1</sub> regardless of the input image size, but trees with similar spectral characteristics such as Pinus densiflora and Pinus koraiensis had many errors. Therefore, there may be limitations in extracting feature amount only with spectral information of satellite images, and classification accuracy may be improved by using images containing various pattern information such as vegetation index and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)."

Those data sets divided into 70 % for training and 30 % for testing were provided as inputs to two popular algorithms, the multi layer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM). Our results showed that the MLP algorithm exhibited superior prediction performance for data recorded at one-minute intervals rather than those updated hourly or daily. In addition, the MLP algorithm was found to work best for data with seasonality. The predictive accuracy was, however, slightly lower for the MLP algorithm than for the LSTM algorithm which yielded error rates as low as 0.04 in terms of the mean absolute error. All these results implied that the use of high-frequency data played an important role in improving the performance of deep learning as well as the proposed methodology could be used to prioritize candidate algorithms with input data (resolution) for prediction of weather variables."

However, the various variability and uncertainty are existing in the soil layer, so it is difficult to grasp the characteristics of the entire field from the limited test results.

We analyze the ESG-rating data from Korea Corporate Governance Service and corporate information data from NICE. For feature selection, the correlation coefficient, logistic regression, and random forest models are employed. Each model is fitted by a deep neural network for binary classification. The random-forest-based feature selection yields a significant performance improvement. Classification with the deep neural network can make better performance when its network has five hidden layers. The deep learning technique in our model enables a more effective credit-rating model than the existing system, even with easily accessible and available data.

In the early days of DL-based FWI, the DL model predicted the velocity model by preparing a large training data set to adopt faithfully the basic principles of data science and apply a pure data-based prediction model. The current research trend is to supplement the shortcomings of the pure data-based approach using the loss function consisting of seismic data or physical information from the wave equation itself in deep neural networks. Based on these developments, DL-based FWI has evolved to not require a large amount of learning data, alleviating the cycle-skipping problem, which is an intrinsic limitation of FWI, and reducing computation times dramatically. The value of DL-based FWI is expected to increase continually in the processing of seismic data."

As a result, smart tourism applications such as tourism recommender systems have advanced significantly in recent years. However, unlike the industry's development, theoretical and methodological approaches to the tourism recommender system in academia are still lacking. As a result, 'DSESTR,' a new and efficient smart tourism recommender system to aid tourists' decision-making, was proposed in this study. First, the Doc2Vec technique was used to learn the feature vectors of users and items by modeling the sequential interaction between users and items. To model the nonlinearity of consumer-item interaction, the learned vectors are fed into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), one of the deep learning techniques. Finally, the nonlinearity learned in MLP was combined with the linearity learned in matrix factorization, which is widely used in recommender systems, to predict the user's evaluation of the item more accurately. Indeed, using the TripAdvior and MovieLens data sets, the results showed that DSESTR significantly improved prediction accuracy when compared to other recommendation algorithms. Based on the findings, the applicability of DSESTR in the tourism industry was discussed, and theoretical and practical implications were proposed."

Non-volatile memories (NVMs) have been considered for alternative memory storage because they consume little static energy and occupy small area. However, there is a problem for NVMs to be directly adopted. An NVM cell has limited write endurance, so that the lifetime of NVM-based memory system is much shorter than that of conventional memory system. To overcome this problem for the deep learning system, this paper proposes a novel method to extend the lifetime based on the analysis of the deep learning workloads. If an incoming block has more than a predefined number of frequently used values, the cacheline is defined as write friendly block.During the victim selection, the cacheline has lower possibility to be chosen as victim. The experimental results show that the lifetime is increased by about 50% and energy consumption is decreased by 3% with a little performance hurt."

For the best optimization of the deep learning structures used in the DL_ARF, performances with the different layers used in the deep neural network were evaluated. The DL_ARF uses only two input data of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and solar zenith angle (SZA) and it has a very fast calculation speed compared to the typical radiative transfer model’s running time. In addition, accuracy of the DL_ARF was verified by comparing the ARF determined by DL_ARF and by the typical radiative transfer model based ARF (RTM_ARF) results. These comparisons showed very good correlation between DL_ARF and RTM_ARF (slope=1.04~1.06, r=0.95~0.97) and high accuracy (bias=0.68~2.03 W/m2, RMSE=6.51~8.41 W/m2) was obtained. The ARF calculation time of DL_ARF was significantly shortened compared to the ARF calculation time of the radiative transfer model. The aerosol radiation forcing efficiency (ARFE) of Seoul and Gangneung was calculated and compared by applying the DL_ARF model developed in this study. As a result, ARFE in Gangneung and Seoul are -1.22 W/m2∕ τ, -1.03 W/m2∕ τ, respectively. Interestingly, ARFE in Gangneung is 18.4% lower than Seoul because aerosols in Gangneung have less single scattering albedo (SSA) values than Seoul indicating the more absorbing aerosols. DL_ARF can be effectively used to provide real-time data needed to study complex surface atmospheric motion and climate change."

The proposed method has the following originality that is different from theexisting method. First, the position of the vertex of the sphere is modified to be very similar to the 3D point cloudof an object through a deep learning network, unlike the existing method of building edges or faces by connectingnearby points. Because 3D point cloud is used, less memory is required and faster operation is possible becauseonly addition operation is performed between offset value at the vertices of the sphere. Second, the 3D mesh isreconstructed by covering the surface information of the sphere on the modified vertices. Even when the distancebetween the points of the 3D point cloud created by correcting the position of the vertices of the sphere is notconstant, it already has the face information of the sphere called face information of the sphere, which indicateswhether the points are connected or not, thereby preventing simplification or loss of expression. can do.

Deep learning (DL) method which is attracting widespread interest has proven to be an efficient approach to measure the similarity between image pairs in quick and accurate manner by extracting complex and detailed features from satellite images. However, Image matching of VHR satellite images remains challenging due to limitations of DL models in which the results are depending on the quantity and quality of training dataset, as well as the difficulty of creating training dataset with VHR satellite images. Therefore, this study examines the feasibility of DL-based method in matching pair extraction which is the most time-consuming process during image registration. This paper also aims to analyze factors that affect the accuracy based on the configuration of training dataset, when developing training dataset from existing multi-sensor VHR image database with bias for DL-based image matching. For this purpose, the generated training dataset were composed of correct matching pairs and incorrect matching pairs by assigning true and false labels to image pairs extracted using a grid-based Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for a total of 12 multi-temporal and multi-sensor VHR images. The Siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN), proposed for matching pair extraction on constructed training dataset, proceeds with model learning and measures similarities by passing two images in parallel to the two identical convolutional neural network structures. The results from this study confirm that data acquired from VHR satellite image database can be used as DL training dataset and indicate the potential to improve efficiency of the matching process by appropriate configuration of multi-sensor images. DL-based image matching techniques using multi-sensor VHR satellite images are expected to replace existing manual-based feature extraction methods based on its stable performance, thus further develop into an integrated DL-based image registration framework."

We then assessed the performance of two deep learning algorithms, recurrent neural network (RNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), on those prepared data sets. Our finding showed that the prediction accuracy of the RNN algorithm increased progressively with the time resolution of input data from weekly data to daily data. The RNN also achieved its superior performance on the daily data, regardless of dependent variables. The only exception was the variable carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. When a comparison was made between those algorithms, the RNN algorithm was found to have slightly better accuracy than the GRU algorithm. Collectively, all these results revealed that the temporal resolution of input data was strongly responsible for changes in the performance of deep learning, specifically for those used in time series prediction."

In the process of developing artificial intelligence, various normative ethical theories are loaded into AI. In this process, we first graft the non-consequentialism and consequential normative ethics theories among act-centered normative theories to AI. The reason that act-centered normative theories is loaded first is because it is easy to mount this theory on artificial intelligence because it presents a simple structural standard of motive and result of acts as a criterion for evaluating the value of acts. However, in order for AI to perfectly fulfill its role as an artificial moral agent, it must be equipped with the character-centered normative theories as well as the act-centered normative theories. This is because the diversity of evaluation criteria created by the loading of various ethical theories implies the possibility of choosing more right and good acts. The question is, can AI carry out the process of education and habituation, which can be said to be a characteristic of virtue ethics? This paper will present the application of machine learning and deep learning as a way to solve this problem. As a result, I will show that machine learning and deep learning can solve the difficulties of embedding virtue ethics, and explain the possibility of embedding virtue ethics in artificial moral agents."

Existing studies proposed scene text spotters for English and showed their promising performance. However, studies for non-English text spotter are rarely conducted because of a lack of fine-quality labeled training datasets. In particular, Korean text spotting is considered to be harder than English because of a large number of characters in Korean. In this study, we propose an end-to-end scene text spotting network specialized in Korean texts that can read more than 2,300 characters. To overcome the lack-of-dataset problem, we propose using a transfer learning method. By pretraining both modules (detector and recognizer) of the network with multi-language datasets and fine-tuning only the recognizer with the Korean dataset, we could construct the robust scene text spotter. We expect that our work can offer useful learning guidelines to future scene text models for non-English language that does not have sufficient training datasets."

Transformer may be appropriate for reconstructing skin textures where a similar pattern can be easily found even between distant regions, but the efficient super resolution transformer (ESRT) model does not exhibit acceptable perceptual quality in super resolution of clinical skin images. In this paper, we propose an extension of ESRT as a super resolution approach to reconstructing dermoscopy-level high-resolution skin images from low-resolution clinical skin images. In the propose model, the transformer backbone and the convolutional neural network backbone are connected in parallel rather than in series by changing the existing architecture to learn the features of skin lesion texture efficiently. Moreover, the perceptual loss is employed to enhance the perceptual quality of fine textures. We show that the proposed model effectively improves the perceptual quality of super resolution skin images compared to other existing models."

Experiment results have shown that the proposed method achieves a performance improvement of 0.041 ~ 0.071 for Dic Coefficient and 0.062 ~ 0.112 for Jaccard Index, compared with the previous method."

Thus, most BIM models today does not guarantee the semantic integrity of space designations, limiting their potential applicability. Recent studies have explored ways to automate space allocation in BIM models using artificial intelligence algorithms, but they are limited in their scope and relatively low classification accuracy. This study explored the use of Graph Convolutional Networks, an algorithm exclusively tailored for graph data structures.

In this study, we propose a new Korean part-of-speech tagging method based on the Head-Tail tokenization technique that divides a word into a lexical morpheme part and a grammatical morpheme part without decomposing compound words.In this method, the Head-Tail is divided by the syllable boundary without restoring irregular deformation or abbreviated syllables. Korean part-of-speech tagger was implemented using the Head-Tail tokenization and deep learning technique. In order to solve the problem that a large number of complex tags are generated due to the segmented tags and the tagging accuracy is low, we reduced the number of tags to a complex tag composed of large classification tags, and as a result, we improved the tagging accuracy. The performance of the Head-Tail part-of-speech tagger was experimented by using BERT, syllable bigram, and subword bigram embedding, and both syllable bigram and subword bigram embedding showed improvement in performance compared to general BERT.Part-of-speech tagging was performed by integrating the Head-Tail tokenization model and the simplified part-of-speech tagging model, achieving 98.99% word unit accuracy and 99.08% token unit accuracy. As a result of the experiment, it was found that the performance of part-of-speech tagging improved when the maximum token length was limited to twice the number of words."

However, MRI can cause motion artifacts in patients who are unable to cooperate due to long scan times; thus, various techniques have been developed to shorten MRI examination times. Deep learning (DL) techniques that significantly reduce scan times while maintaining high image quality are attracting the attention of researchers. In this study, to determine the usefulness of DL techniques for lumbar spine MRIs, sagittal and axial T2 emphasis images were obtained before and after a DL technique was applied, and signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, scan time, overall image quality, and consistency of lesion diagnosis were compared and analyzed. It was found that the quality of the image improved and the artifacts caused by movement or breathing were reduced owing to the shorter MRI examination time. Hence, it is expected that MRI examination using DL techniques will provide images with higher diagnostic value while increasing patient satisfaction, making it a useful method in clinical practice."

To resolve the above problems, additional processing using a digital elevation model and deep learning approach have been proposed. Unfortunately, these approaches are not sufficiently effective in solving these problems. This study proposed a change detection method that considers both positional and topology information of buildings. Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) was trained on a SpaceNet building detection v2 dataset, and the central points of each building were extracted as building nodes. Then, triangulated irregular network graphs were created on building nodes from temporal images. To extract the area, where there is a structural difference between two graphs, a change index reflecting the similarity of the graphs and differences in the location of building nodes was proposed. Finally, newly changed or deleted buildings were detected by comparing the two graphs. Three pairs of test sites were selected to evaluate the proposed method’s effectiveness, and the results showed that changed buildings were detected in the case of side-view satellite images with building positional inconsistencies."

In complex and diversified battlefield situations, it is difficult to guarantee high-level ATR accuracy and generalization performance with image data alone. Therefore, we propose a knowledge graph-based ATR method that can utilize image and text data simultaneously in this paper. The main idea of the knowledge graph and deep model-based ATR method is to convert the ATR image and text into graphs according to the characteristics of each data, align it to the knowledge graph, and connect the heterogeneous ATR data through the knowledge graph. In order to convert the ATR image into a graph, an object-tag graph consisting of object tags as nodes is generated from the image by using the pre-trained image object recognition model and the vocabulary of the knowledge graph. On the other hand, the ATR text uses the pre-trained language model, TF-IDF, co-occurrence word graph, and the vocabulary of knowledge graph to generate a word graph composed of nodes with key vocabulary for the ATR. The generated two types of graphs are connected to the knowledge graph using the entity alignment model for improvement of the ATR performance from images and texts.

With the recent development of the computer vision, research has attempted to analyze perceptions of urban built environments such as 'beauty', 'lively', 'safety', and 'walking‘. Using the training set that represent perception of street view images, previous studies have developed models that predict the score of the image on a particular emotion. Typically, they have proposed models based on Siamese network and a loss function that learns the rank that returns the rank of each image on a particular emotion. However, if the characteristics of the built environment are not distinctive, there is a limit to increasing the accuracy of the model. Therefore, we propose a model that learns both regional features on images by dividing each image into patches and global features. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we collected Kakao streetview images of Jeonju, implemented the model to predict the walkability score using the pairwise comparison data and measured accuracy. Our model records the highest accuracy compared to the existing studies. Our model is considered to effectively learn the characteristics of streetview images regardless of the size of the city."

Therefore, it plays a vital role in LBSNs, namely POI recommendation system. In the machine learning model, most of the training data are stored in the centralized data storage, so information that belongs to the user will store in the centralized storage, and users may face privacy issues.

For highly accurate topography characteriza- tion, a large number of training images with various background conditions are required. Since the real lunar topography images are difficult to obtain, it should be helpful to be able to generate mimic lunar image data artificially on the basis of the planetary analogs site images and real lunar images available. In this study, we aim to artificially create lunar topography images by using the location information-based style transfer algorithm known as Wavelet Correct Transform (WCT2). We conducted comparative experiments using lunar analog site images and real lunar topography images taken during China's and America's lunar-exploring projects (i.e., Chang’e and Apollo) to assess the efficacy of our suggested approach. The results show that the proposed techniques can create realistic images, which preserve the topography information of the analog site image while still showing the same condition as an image taken on lunar surface. The proposed algorithm also outperforms a conventional algorithm, Deep Photo Style Transfer (DPST) in terms of temporal and visual aspects. For future work, we intend to use the generated styled image data in combination with real image data for training lunar topography objects to be applied for topographic detection and segmentation. It is expected that this approach can significantly improve the performance of detection and segmentation models on real lunar topography images."

The number of cases of living donor liver transplantation is increasing due to the imbalance in needs and supplies for brain-dead organ donation. As a result, the importance of the accuracy of the donor’s suitability evaluation is also increasing rapidly. To measure the donor’s liver volume accurately is the most important, that is absolutely necessary for the recipient's postoperative progress and the donor’s safety. Therefore, we propose liver segmentation in abdom- inal CT images from pre-operation, POD 7, and POD 63 with a two-dimensional U-Net. In addition, we introduce an algorithm to measure the volume of the segmented liver and measure the hepatectomy rate and regeneration rate of pre-operation, POD 7, and POD 63. The performance for the learning model shows the best results in the images from pre-operation. Each dataset from pre-operation, POD 7, and POD 63 has the DSC of 94.55 ± 9.24%, 88.40 ± 18.01%, and 90.64 ± 14.35%.

VGG annotator를 이용하여 모든 이미지 데이터에 결함의 위치, 형상, 종류에 관한 정보를 목록화하였다. 검출 모델은 ResNet-101을 backbone 네트워크로 하는 Mask R-CNN을 기반으로 설계되었으며, 모델은 IOU(intersection over union) 50% 이상에 대한 mAP(mean average precision)로 평가되었다. 또한 KS F 2151에서 규정한 방식으로 각 결함의 기준 치수가 산출되도록 모델을 설계하였다. 테스트 세트에 대한 모델의 mAP는 57.0%로 산출되었는데, 이는 4종의 옹이만 학습한 모델의 mAP 80.4%보다 낮다. 성능 감소의 원인은 갈라짐에 대한 모델의 검출 성능이 낮았던 것에 기인한다. 갈라짐에 대한 검출 오류는 주석을 달지 않은 미세한 갈라짐을 모델이 검출한 경우, 그리고 길게 분포된 하나의 갈라짐을 모델이 다중의 갈라짐으로 검출한 경우의 두 가지 유형으로 분석되었다. 이러한 오류는 주석 수정 및 데이터 세트 증량을 통해 개선할 수 있을 것으로 판단된다. 개발된 모델은 옹이만을 다루던 기존 자동화 탐지 기법과는 달리 다양한 결함들을 검출할 뿐만 아니라 결함의 정량화 기능을 갖추어 목재 표면 검사에 실질적 도움이 될 것으로 기대된다.",다국어 초록 정보 없음

In order to improve the performance of human activity classification, most studies have applied deep learning based-transfer learning. However, despite the increase in the number of backbone network models that are the basis of deep learning as well as the diversification of architectures, research on finding a backbone network model suitable for the purpose of operation is insufficient due to the atmosphere of using a certain model. Thus, this study applies the transfer learning into recently developed deep learning backborn network models to build an intelligent system that classifies human activity using imagery. For this, 12 types of active and high-contact human activities based on sports, not basic human behaviors, were determined and 7,200 images were collected. After 20 epochs of transfer learning were equally applied to five backbone network models, we quantitatively analyzed them to find the best backbone network model for human activity classification in terms of learning process and resultant performance. As a result, XceptionNet model demonstrated 0.99 and 0.91 in training and validation accuracy, 0.96 and 0.91 in Top 2 accuracy and average precision, 1,566 sec in train process time and 260.4MB in model memory size. It was confirmed that the performance of XceptionNet was higher than that of other models."

Therefore, the hereditary shamans that live in the area around the East Coast of south Korea have performed various Gut(a shaman ritual) such as Byeolsingut, Pungeoje, Ogugut, Sanogugut, and Dosingut, Jaesugut, Gwangingut, Gaekgumulligi, and so on. However, currently, only Byeolsingut and Ogugut are handed down.

In previous researches, researches related to the various elements that consist of the Donghaeangut, such as shaman’s song, shaman’s dance, shaman’s play, paper flowers, decorations of shaman’s ritual and so on are abundant; but researches about Mugwan is thin. Therefore, this paper will analyze Mugwan which is each performed in Byeolsingut and Ogu-gut and commonly performed in both Gut. In addition, the hereditary shamans were actively handed down from generation to generation through marriage, but new shamans, who studies shaman’s music and song in the university, are active in Donghaeangut; according to such change, how the learning Mugwan has been changed might be analyzed. Traditionally, shamans learned Mugwan in everyday life; however, new shamans who learn systematically traditional music are learning Mugwan step by step through individual lessons, group lessons, or art-related school majors and etc. In the midst of these changes, new shamans are continuously recording and documenting the process of whole learning including Mugwan. Based on these efforts, the outstanding artistry of hereditary shamans, which is handed down from generation to generation, will be able to be passed on to the next generation."

Activation functions are used for deep reinforcement learning, and various activation functions have been proposed, but their performance deviations were large depending on the application environment. Therefore, finding the optimal activation function depending on the environment is important for effective learning. This paper analyzes 12 functions mainly used in reinforcement learning to compare and evaluate which activation function is most effective when autonomous vehicles use deep reinforcement learning to learn parking. To this end, a performance evaluation environment was established, and the average reward of each activation function was compared with the success rate, episode length, and vehicle speed. As a result, the highest reward was the case of using GELU, and the ELU was the lowest. The reward difference between the two activation functions was 35.2%."

To effectively defend against these malicious apps, it is required to detect them and implement a tailored defense strategy. Recently, deep learning technology has received a lot of attention from the community, and defense strategies using it are being devised in the field of information security. The existing Android malicious app detection technology using deep learning collects raw data from a central cloud server and trains the ML model in a centralized way. However, in this process, the raw data of the smartphone user must be transmitted to the central data server in advance. This leads to a decrease in smartphone users' participation in centralized ML learning as sensitive personal information is likely to be collected indiscriminately. In this paper, we propose a method to detect malicious Android apps in a distributed manner without leakage of personal information using federated learning.

The participants were 272 sixth graders, living in Seoul, Korea. The instrument to survey consists of four parts: perception of nature, companion of natural experience, connection to nature, and engagement in science learning. The results of this study are as follows. First, the average of natural experience near their home and the average of preference for nature in parks and deep forests were the highest. Students often experienced nature with their parents. In addition, the number of positive emotional responses to all natural places was the highest, and the proportion of evocative emotions in deep forests and botanical gardens was higher than in other natural places. Second, natural experience by place, companion of natural experience, and preference for nature by place influence connection to nature positively. Third, connection to nature directly affects engagement in science learning. As the connection to nature is positive, engagement in science learning increases. These results suggest that in order to expand the natural experiences of elementary school students, it is necessary to prepare efficient scientific education methods so that they can experience various natural experiences inside and outside of school."

Deep learning-based image recognition has proven its ability to efficiently process P&ID and potentially replace manual analysis. Previous studies on symbol recognition have achieved outstanding performance based on supervised learning. They are, however, limited in that they require large amounts of high-quality labeled datasets, and producing those datasets is expensive and takes a considerable amount of time. This causes difficulties in application in the field where P&ID must be analyzed as quickly and precisely as possible within a short bidding time. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised symbol recognition model based on novel labeling dataset methods. We minimized manual labeling work using Template Matching and advanced fake drawing. By using only 2.5% labeled datasets of standard operations, our model achieved an F1 score of 99.55 in symbol recognition and 99.34 in symbol detection involving 15 random P&IDs, compared to the supervised model’s F1 score of 95.29 and 97.43 respectively.

The literature analysis was conducted based on the results of a team project in the practical arts education course among second-year students at A-University of Education. The participants included seven students of the practical arts education course, all of whom were interviewed. Their results were then qualitatively analyzed. The main findings were as follows.First, the development of the practical arts subject curriculum by University of Education students was meaningful in that it provided fresh ideas about the content structure and framework of the practical arts subject curriculum at the college level. However, the practical arts education curriculum development was not sufficiently deep. Second, students of the College of Education recognized that the systematic flow of the overall team project was important. In addition, there were requests to expand the degree of student choice and autonomy, introduce a fair individual evaluation system, and strengthen factors for vitalizing team projects.

However, unlike those who clamored for the problem of the superficial, it tried to wrestle with deep-seated issues. Following this tradition, I intend to construe and reflect on the spirit of the university that, though residing within the world, does not belong it. To show this, I introduce the story of Wittenberg University that tried to break through the existing order while remaining in it, and consider the theoretical heritage of Durkheim and Weber, who laid the foundation for sociological endeavors, that pursued higher moral ideals beyond reality and the ethical orientation of the ‘world-denying’, to shed light on the calling of the university. Today's universities have become more specialized than ever before. It is an achievement gained by the university, and it is also a problem of its own making. Universities must serve the younger generation that comes in to keep up with the times. However, the reason why universities exist is not to keep pace with trends. Even if the university's ‘Silicon Valleyization' is rampant, they have a mission to ask a higher and deeper question than that. The university must be a place to think together about neighbors across the globe, examine the existential crisis of the planet, a place for those who used to live as big fish in a little pond to be shaken-up with the urgent needs and crises of life itself. If it is a ‘place of great learning’, it is a place that opens up new horizons to enable them to meet a higher purpose in life, open their eyes to a wider world of life, and reflect on it’s meaning."

The existing learning methods update the embedding function under the influence of the data in a mini-batch. For this reason, the embedding of a data sample can get close to the embedding of another data sample of a different class that does not exist in the mini-batch, and thus it may degrade the performance of the model. To overcome the drawback, we propose an adaptive metric learning method based on confusion rates. The proposed method calculates confusion rates between every pair of classes in the entire dataset, and then it adjusts the magnitudes and directions of gradients considering the confusion rates in training. This method prevents the embedding of a data sample from becoming closer to the embeddings of data samples whose classes are likely to be confused, and thus it helps the model generate fine-grained embeddings.

Automatic facial expression recognition can achieve high performance through deep learning methods, however, generally requires a expensive large data set. The size of the data set and the performance of the algorithm are tend to be proportional. The proposed method learns latent deep representation of a face through self-supervised learning using an existing dataset without constructing an additional dataset. Then it transfers the learned parameter to new facial expression reorganization model for improving the performance of automatic expression recognition.

기계학습 모델 복잡도에 따른 템퍼드 마르텐사이트 경도 예측 정확도 비교 연구,2022,"['prediction accuracy', 'model complexity', 'machine learning', 'model regression', 'tempered martensite hardness']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We investigated various numerical methods including a physical-based empirical equation, linear regression, shallow neural network, and deep learning approaches, to compare their accuracy for predicting the hardness of tempered martensite in low alloy steels. The physical-based empirical equation, which had been previously proposed with experimental data, was labelled and used in the present study. While it had a smaller number of coefficients, the prediction accuracy of the physical-based empirical equation was almost similar to that of the regression model based on the response surface method. The prediction accuracy of the machine learning models clearly improved as the number of layers increased and became more complicated in structure before the model began to overfit. The key point we found was that a single layered neural network model with optimized hyperparameters resulted in similar or better hardness prediction performance compared to deep learning models with a more complex architecture. We also analyzed 18 research papers from the literature which used neural network models to predict the hardness of steels. Only two recent papers adopted a convolutional neural network, as a kind of deep learning model, in a new attempt to predict hardness. The other 16 papers from 1998 to 2021 commonly chose shallow neural network models because a more complicated model is less effective than a simple model for regression problems with well-labeled experimental data in materials science and engineering."

Dynamic service placement via live migration, which moves any service instances to a remote host while preserving the availability, is a persistent decision making process for providers to optimize their service arrangement according to the changing environment. However, various service requirements and hierarchical data center networks complicate the dynamic service placement in edge computing. In this paper, a methodology for dynamic service placement in edge computing environment is proposed using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Through iterative learning of multiple agents to the environment dynamics, the proposed DRL algorithms generate a service placement policy that migrates running services to suitable host servers so that improvement in service latency and service availability can be maximized. The proposed algorithms also relate migration cost of service downtime to service availability in terms of server failure and SLA availability."

This study attempted to expand the existing meta studies by extending achievement-related variables to self-regulated learning variables and by including performance-avoidance goals which were neglected in the previous meta studies. Therefore, this study examined the relationships between either performance-approach goals and self-regulated learning variables from a cognitive aspect(surface strategy, deep strategy, metacognition), behavioral aspect (effort regulation, help-seeking, resource management, academic procrastination), self-efficacy, and emotional aspect (interest, anxiety), or performance-avoidance goals and self-regulated learning variables. Moreover, this study verified whether these relationships differed by the moderators (i.e., definition of the performance goals and school level). We reviewed 111 correlational studies, composed of a total of 103,987 participants. As a result of the meta-analysis, the performance approach goal showed a positive relationship with the remaining variables except for academic procrastination, whereas the performance avoidance goal showed a positive relationship with the surface strategy, academic procrastination, and anxiety, and a negative relationship with self-efficacy. There was a significant moderating effect according to the definition of the performance goal. In the case of the performance-approach goals, the effect size with the deep strategy was lower in the meaning of ability validation than in the meaning of normative comparison. In the case of performance-avoidance goals, there was a significant moderating effect in more diverse variables including cognitive aspect (deep strategy and metacognition) and behavior aspect (effort regulation, help-seeking, resource management, and academic procrastination). In general, performance-avoidance goals showed maladaptive features under the meaning of ability validation. On the contrary, a significant moderating effect was also found according to the school level. The positive relationship between the performance-approach goals and either deep strategy or self-efficacy, and the positive relationship between the performance- avoidance goals and the surface strategy, were greater in middle school students than college students. Based on these results, the implications of separating the definitions of the performance-approach goals and performance-avoidance goals and considering school-level in future research on achievement goals were discussed."

As the awareness of the importance of the walking environment has increased, many studies have been conducted to identify the physical components that constitute the walking environment and to find out what kind of walking environment people consider good for walking. Existing methods for analyzing the qualitative walking environment based on surveys targeting residents or experts showed limitations in their representativeness. On the other hand, the recent development of high-resolution street view images and deep learning technology makes it possible to obtain detailed perceived walkability scores by using paired comparison data for street view images as a training set. However, perceived walkability score prediction based on deep learning technology has limitations in providing an answer to why such evaluation score was obtained. The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of the urban landscape that affect the perceived walkability based on street view images. In this study, we tested various machine learning models with the perceived walkability score of the street image as the dependent variable and the semantic segmentation ratio value of the street view image as the independent variable. According to our study, the regression equation of the support vector machine was the most accurate. And in predicting the perceived walkability score, the importance of the object was in the order of roads, sidewalks, buildings, trees, and the sky. Our study showed that the higher the segmentation value, the higher the perceived walkability score for sidewalk, streetlight, road, grass, and tree. On the contrary, the higher the segmentation value, the lower the score for ashcans, mountains, trucks, and walls. This study is meaningful in that it was possible to identify important objects and their direction that affect the evaluation of the walking environment through the machine learning model, and to partially explain the perceived walkability score predicted by the deep learning model."

A probing classifier has been developed as a method to analyze the internal mechanism of such a model. We first evaluate the validity of this method in three respects by taking into account such control factors as task, function, and dataset that can cause defects when applying a probing classifier.

However, they suffer from the problem of “negative transfer,” in which transferred knowledge operates as noise in a rich domain.  In turn, it decreases their recommendation performance. This paper proposes a novel Deep Fusion-based Multi-target Cross-Domain Recommendation named DFMCDR. By exploiting Doc2Vec, one of the famous word embedding techniques, we fuse temporal-sequentially and transfer knowledge across domains user-wise to model users and items. In addition, a deep neural network structure is introduced to effectively learn the linearity and non-linearity of user-item interactions and integrate them to predict users’ preference possibility. Extensive experiments with three domain (i.e., restaurant, hotel, and attraction) datasets from TripAdvisor, one real-world online review service, demonstrate that DFMCDR outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for single and cross-domain recommendations. Furthermore, an additional experiment shows that DFMCDR can be effectively and efficiently adapted to multi-target cross-domain recommendation fusing for more domains."

In a typical CAD system, the accurate classification of skin lesion types is of great importance for improving the diagnosis performance. Motivated by this, we propose a novel deep ensemble classification with multi-scale attention networks. The proposed deep ensemble networks are jointly trained using a single loss function in an end-to-end manner. In addition, the proposed deep ensemble network is equipped with a multi-scale attention mechanism and segmentation information of the original skin input image, which improves the classification performance. To demonstrate our method, the publicly available human skin disease dataset (HAM 10000) and the private animal skin lesion dataset were used for the evaluation. Experiment results showed that the proposed methods can achieve 97.8% and 81% accuracy on each HAM10000 and animal skin lesion dataset.

Process control has been implemented by utilizing traditional techniques such as PID (Proportional-Integrate-Derivative) control andMPC (Model Predictive Control).

RL (Reinforcement Learning) is one of the most prominent data-driven techniques for addressing such issues and has gained popularity in recent years. While RL has been extensively studied and succeeds in controlling chemical processes, the reward function has a significant impact on its performance. Therefore, it is essential to specify the reward function in order to efficiently control the process. In this study, we propose a reward function to enhance the performance of RL and compare the control performances of MPC and RLs with four distinct reward functions. The controllers track the setpoint of the product in the Van de Vusse process and are evaluated based on the deviation between the setpoint and output. RL with the proposed reward function outperformed the other controllers. Its performance was 12% greater than that of MPC and 6-30% greater than other RL controllers.

This is because quality evaluation agencies in each country are continually strengthening new safety standards for vehicles. Among these various requirements, collision safety must be satisfied by controlling airbags, seat belts, etc., and can be defined as post-crash safety. Apart from this safety system, the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) use advanced detection sensors, GPS, communication, and video equipment to detect the hazard and notify driver before the collision. However, research to improve passenger safety in case of an accident by using the sensor of active safety represented by ADAS in the existing passive safety is limited to the level that utilizes the sudden braking level of the FCA (Forward Collision-avoidance Assist) system. Therefore, this study aims to develop logic that can improve passenger protection in case of an accident by using ADAS information and driving information secured before a collision. The proposed logic was constructed based on LSTM deep learning techniques and trained using crash test data."

In this case, spectrum mapping and Time-Frequency (T-F) masking techniques were used as learning targets, and a real network and a complex network were used for the network structure. The performance of the speech enhancement model was evaluated through two objective evaluation metrics: Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) and Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) depending on the scale of the dataset. Test results show the appropriate size of the training data differs depending on the type of networks and the type of dataset. In addition, they show that, in some cases, using a real network may be a more realistic solution if the number of total parameters is considered because the real network shows relatively higher performance than the complex network depending on the size of the data and the learning target."

This paper proposes a deep learning model comprising attention and convolutional recurrent neural networks that can select and extract the time-series pattern of dynamic connectivity between the two regions within the brain based on observations. By integration of the extracted autism disorder features from dynamic connectivity through attention with the structure containing interlayer connections to preserve the functional connectivity loss within a neural network, the model extracts the connectivity between the STS and visual cortex, leading to an increase in generalization performance. A 10-fold cross-validation to compare the performance shows that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models by achieving an improvement of 4.90% in the ASD classification. Additionally, we use the proposed method to diagnose ASD by visualizing dynamic brain connectivity of the neural network layers."

DNNs have recently been used in various fields based on its excellent predictive power and accuracy, but there are insufficient cases of applying it to multivariate regression analysis. Therefore, we propose a simultaneous estimation method of a nonlinear multivariate regression model by applying a fully connected deep neural network, the basic structure of neural networks, to multivariate regression analysis, and it was confirmed through simulation that the proposed model performed better than the existing regression models learned each response variable independently."

This study investigated the possibility of a real-time leak detection method using the acoustic emission (AE) signal generated from the piping system during the internal leakage of a butterfly valve. Datasets of raw time-domain AE signals were collected and postprocessed for each operation mode of the valve in a systematic manner to develop a data-driven model for the detection and classification of internal leakage, by applying machine learning algorithms. The aim of this study was to determine whether it is possible to treat leak detection as a classification problem by applying two classification algorithms: support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The results showed different performances for the algorithms and datasets used. The SVM-based binary classification models, based on feature extraction of data, achieved an overall accuracy of 83% to 90%, while in the case of a multiple classification model, the accuracy was reduced to 66%. By contrast, the CNN-based classification model achieved an accuracy of 99.85%, which is superior to those of any other models based on the SVM algorithm. The results revealed that the SVM classification model requires effective feature extraction of the AE signals to improve the accuracy of multi-class classification. Moreover, the CNN-based classification can be a promising approach to detect both leakage and valve opening as long as the performance of the processor does not degrade."

To realize a stable and practical recognition performance, large amount of facial image data should be acquired for the purpose of training. However, it is difficult for the researchers to obtain masked face images for each human subject. This paper proposes a novel method to synthesize a face image and a virtual mask pattern. In this method, a pair of masked face image and unmasked face image, that are from a single human subject, is fed into a convolutional autoencoder as training data. This allows learning the geometric relationship between face and mask. In the inference step, for a unseen face image, the learned convolutional autoencoder generates a synthetic face image with a mask pattern. The proposed method is able to rapidly generate realistic masked face images. Also, it could be practical when compared to methods which rely on facial feature point detection."

However, this can be a risky for teenagers under the age of 18 years because they may become exposed to information that is unsuitable for them. Some social media platforms have established age-restricted content policies to prevent teenagers from being exposed to bad information. However, unsuitable content that has not been marked as age-restricted still exists online as a result of the enormous volume of information provided on the Internet and the inability to identify it immediately, among other factors. It is important to classify restricted and unrestricted content to protect teenagers’ online safety because teenagers are more likely to be negatively affected by biased and harmful content than adults are. We suggest a strategy for classifying restricted and unrestricted content in this study by examining content comments. We collected and cleaned comments obtained from two datasets (each containing restricted and unrestricted content comments, respectively) from YouTube. Word2vec was used to display comments as vectors, and the classifier was established using convolutional neural network and long short-term memory. Through our findings, we hope make the social media environment more secure to protect the physical and mental health of teenagers."

However, predicting the performance of PMSM by commonly used 2-D finite element analysis (FEA) is error-prone due to axial leakage flux. Therefore, the axial leakage flux should be considered in the sizing process. The most accurate way to consider the axial leakage flux is to perform 3-D FEA, but it has the disadvantage of being computationally expensive. From this perspective, this paper proposes a deep transfer learning-based surrogate modeling method to reduce the computational cost for calculating 3-D FEA-based motor parameters. Transfer learning is performed using a large amount of 2-D FEA-based and a small amount of 3-D FEA-based motor parameters. Using the proposed process, it is possible to accurately predict the motor characteristics according to the size-related variables that satisfy the required specifications with a small amount of 3D FEA-based motor parameters. The proposed method was verified through 3D FEA and experiments for PMSM designed from this method."

Particularly, the deep-learning based image super-resolution methods have shown great potential for improving image resolution and thus the machine-vision based measurement. In this article, we firstly review the latest progress of several deep learning based super-resolution models, together with the public benchmark datasets and the performance evaluation index. Secondly, we construct a binocular visual measurement platform to measure the distances of the adjacent corners on a chessboard that is universally used as a target when measuring the structure displacement via machine-vision based approaches. And then, several typical deep learning based super resolution algorithms are employed to improve the visual measurement performance. Experimental results show that super-resolution reconstruction technology can improve the accuracy of distance measurement of adjacent corners. According to the experimental results, one can find that the measurement accuracy improvement of the super resolution algorithms is not consistent with the existing quantitative performance evaluation index. Lastly, the current challenges and future trends of super resolution algorithms for visual measurement applications are pointed out."

To overcome this, in this paper, we propose an automatedmethod based on the deep learning scene graph generation technique.

In 2005, many models have been proposed, including deep learning-based models, which are receiving a lot of attention within the recommender model. The recommender model can be classified into a collaborative filtering method, a content-based method, and a hybrid method that uses these two methods integrally. However, these basic methods are gradually losing their status as methodologies in the field as they fail to adapt to internal and external changing factors such as the rapidly changing user-item interaction and the development of big data. On the other hand, the importance of deep learning methodologies in recommender systems is increasing because of its advantages such as nonlinear transformation, representation learning, sequence modeling, and flexibility. In this paper, among deep learning methodologies, RNN, CNN, and GAN-based models suitable for sequential modeling that can accurately and flexibly analyze user-item interactions are classified, compared, and analyzed."
Camera localization with Siamese neural networks using iterative relative pose estimation,2022,"['camera localization', 'camera pose estimation', 'motion estimation', 'deep learning', 'neural network', 'augmented reality']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper presents a novel deep learning-based camera localization method using iterative relative pose estimation to improve the accuracy of pose estimation from a single RGB image. Although most existing deep learning-based camera localization methods are more robust for textureless cases, illumination changes, and occlusions, they are less accurate than other non-deep learning-based methods. The proposed method improved the localization accuracy by using the relative poses between the input image and the training dataset images. It simultaneously trained the network for the absolute poses of the input images and their relative poses using Siamese networks. In the inference stage, it estimated the absolute pose of a query image and iteratively updated the pose using relative pose information. Real world examples with widely used camera localization datasets and our dataset were utilized to validate the performance of the proposed method, which exhibited higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art deep learning-based camera localization methods. In the end, the application of the proposed method to augmented reality was presented."

AI에는 다양한 이미지가 있지만, 현시점에서는 금융기관으로부터 AI 기술을 활용한 만능의 ‘은행원’을 만들어 달라는 요구는 오지 않았다. AI는 사람을 돕고 사람과 협업하는 도구로 고객 및 직원의 편의성 향상을 위해 사용돼야 한다.T&I 이노베이션 센터에서는, 지방은행의 요망에 근거해 최초로 IBM의 Watson을 사용해 기계학습, 심층학습이란 어떠한 것인가를 확인했다. 그 결과 여러 개의 POC를 할 필요 없이 우선 AI를 제대로 이해하고 어떻게 하면 잘 다룰 수 있는지 생각하는 것이 중요하다는 것이다. 현재는 자신이 무엇에 AI를 사용하고 싶은가, 이 부분을 AI가 해주면 도움이 된다 혹은 AI가 여기까지 해주면 된다 라고 하는 형태로, 적절히 한계설정을 하면서 사용하는 것이라고 느끼고 있다.AI를 사용하는 측은 이 분야는 이 정도 비용으로 여기까지 할 수 있으면 된다는 발상으로 생각해야 한다. AI는 자동차와 같은 존재이기 때문에 차를 능숙하게 타는 것처럼 AI 도구를 사용할 수 있게 되면 된다. 게다가 마케팅이나 자산운용 등에 활용하면 되고, 언론에 놀아난 AI 기초연구를 하는 것은 그만두는 것이 좋다. AI 도입 후 은행에서는 사무부문에서 영업부문으로 인력을 이관시킬 것으로 예상된다. 사무 프로세스를 알 수 있고 영업 센스가 있는 직원은 영업으로서의 성능도 높을 것으로 보인다. AI 활용으로 일하는 방식은 달라지고 있다. 콜센터, 의사록, 문서처리 등 AI를 이용한 사무효율화를 추진하고 있지만, 잉여 사무담당자를 영업담당자로 배치 전환한다고 해서 당장 높은 성능을 얻을 수 있지는 않을 것이다. AI의 활용에 의해 일하는 방식을 바꾸는 것에 대해서도 검토를 거듭하지 않으면 안 된다. AI는 화상분석이나 음성분석에 강한 반면 데이터의 의미를 해석하기는 어려운 것으로 알려져 있어 AI에 적합한 분야를 따져 자원을 투입할 필요가 있다.실제로 인간을 지원하는 관점에서 기계학습을 활용하려는 움직임이 많아졌다고 생각한다. 어떠한 과제를 해결하는데, 기계학습을 사용할 수 있는가 하는 것을 의식하면서, 적절한 모델을 구축해 나가는 것이 중요하다고 생각하고 있다. 금융기관의 AI 활용 상황을 보면 비정형 정보 취급 프로세스 개선 방안으로 도입되는 사례가 많다. 구체적으로는 고객의 문의에 대한 음성인식이나 문서입력에 있어서의 AI와 OCR의 조합에 의한 읽기 등이다. 이에 따라 후속 사무가 디지털화되어 효율화가 도모된다.구체적인 서비스로는 챗봇(AI 학습을 통해 FAQ를 자동 작성하고 언어 흔들림을 심층학습으로 조정), 안티 자금세탁, 신용카드 부정탐지 등이 있다. 발밑 AI 활용은 비용절감과 인력감축 등 ROI를 내기 쉬운 분야에서 진행되고 있다. 또 데이터 활용이라는 관점에서는 빅데이터를 포함해 소관하는 AI 전문 부문을 설치해 하나의 도구로 대응하고 있다.

There are various images of AI, but at this point, there has been no request from financial institutions to create an all-round ‘banker’ using AI technology. AI is a tool that helps and collaborates with people, and should be used to improve convenience for customers and employees.At the T&I Innovation Center, based on the request of a regional bank, for the first time, IBM’s Watson was used to confirm machine learning and deep learning. As a result, it is important to first understand AI properly and think about how to handle it well, without having to do multiple POCs. Currently, I feel that I am using it while setting limits appropriately in the form of what I want to use the AI ​​for, it will be helpful if the AI ​​does this part, or if the AI ​​can do it up to this point.Those who use AI should think of this field as an idea that can be done up to this point at this cost. Since AI is like a car, you can use AI tools as if you were able to ride a car skillfully. In addition, it can be used for marketing or asset management, and it is better to stop doing basic AI research that has been played in the media. After the introduction of AI, it is expected that banks will transfer manpower from the office department to the sales department. Employees who can understand the office process and have a sales sense are expected to have high sales performance. The way we work with AI is changing. Although AI-based office efficiency is being promoted, such as call centers, minutes, and document processing, it is unlikely that high performance will be achieved immediately if surplus office workers are assigned to sales managers. Changes in the way we work through the use of AI must be reviewed again and again. AI is strong in image analysis and voice analysis, but it is known that it is difficult to interpret the meaning of data.In fact, I think there has been a lot of movement to utilize machine learning from the point of view of supporting humans. I think it's important to build an appropriate model while being aware of how machine learning can be used to solve certain problems. Looking at the status of AI use by financial institutions, there are many cases where it is introduced as a way to improve the process of handling unstructured information. Specifically, voice recognition for customer inquiries and reading by a combination of AI and OCR in document input are used. As a result, follow-up work is digitized to increase efficiency.Specific services include chatbots (automatically writing FAQs through AI learning and adjusting language shake to deep learning), anti-money laundering, and credit card fraud detection. The use of AI in the footsteps is being carried out in areas where it is easy to generate ROI, such as cost reduction and manpower reduction. In addition, from the point of view of data utilization, it is responding with a single tool by setting up an AI specialized department under its jurisdiction including big data. When using a new technology such as AI, it is clear that the manager's own management philosophy is the first game, and that AI is used for what (work efficiency, improvement of labor productivity, environment where everyone can work happily, etc.) must not be determined Don't expect too much from AI."

First, the data collection criteria were suggested and a total of 2,024 datasets were prepared. And they were randomly classified into 1,417 learning data and 607 evaluation data. After that, the size and quality of the training data set were improved using data augmentation techniques to increase the performance of deep learning. The CNN-based algorithms used in this study were VGGNet-16, VGGNet-19, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121. The evaluation of the defect classification performance was made by comparing the accuracy, loss, and learning speed using verification data. The DenseNet-121 algorithm showed better performance than other algorithms with an accuracy of 99.13% and a loss value of 0.037. This was due to the structural characteristics of the DenseNet model, and the information loss was reduced by acquiring information from all previous layers for image identification in this algorithm. Based on the above results, the possibility of machine vision application of CNN-based model for the surface defect classification of Al extruded materials was also discussed."

The model's validity was determined by comparing the predicted model's performance on a new trial with the scores obtained from the actual test. The results show a high level of prediction accuracy, and out of the 10,380 participants' scores from the TOEIC English assessment taken as a part of a university liberal arts class over three years, for 782 test-takers, there was only a 0.07- point difference in the average scores across 3 test types.

To solve this problem, studies on the detection of insider threat behavior using deep learning are being actively conducted. However, two problems that attack data is very scarce due to the nature of insider threat behavior, and time and action data must be learned at the same time remain challenges. In this paper, we propose an insider threat behavior detection model using the mask language model, which is a pre-learning method of Bi-directional Encoder Representation of Transformer(BERT). We used a CERT dataset for learning and used a custom tokenizer to map the data to actions and times at 30-minute intervals. The characteristics were learned by inputting only normal data into the mask language model, and the sum of the loss values derived from normal data was calculated as a threat score, and the maximum value was set as a detection boundary for each user. After that, if the threat score that occurs when new data is put into the model exceeds the detection boundary, it was detected as an abnormal behavior. The experimental results showed that compared to existing deep learning models, the model reacted sensitively when the behavior occurred at an unusual time, and in the case of scenarios where preparation and initiation of threat behavior were separated, appropriate detection performance was considered. As a result, the unbalanced dataset which was a challenge of detecting insider threat behavior could use the large amount of normal data as an advantage. And unlike the existing LSTM derivatives, sufficiently detailed time data can be mapped to behavior and used for learning."

Although research using optical images is continuously being conducted to determine the waterbody, there is a limitation in that it is difficult to detect due to the influence of clouds in order to detect floods that accompany heavy rain. Therefore, there is a need for research using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that can be observed regardless of day or night in all weather. In this study, using Sentinel-1 SAR images that can be collected in near-real time as open data, the UNet model among deep learning algorithms that have recently been used in various fields was applied. In previous studies, waterbody detection studies using SAR images and deep learning algorithms are being conducted, but only a small number of studies have been conducted in Korea. In this study, to determine the applicability of deep learning of SAR images, UNet and the existing algorithm thresholding method were compared, and five indices and Sentinel-2 normalized difference water index (NDWI) were evaluated. As a result of evaluating the accuracy with intersect of union (IoU), it was confirmed that UNet has high accuracy with 0.894 for UNet and 0.699 for threshold method.

Methods To this end, a unit design <Draft> was prepared by referring to IBO website data, IB majors, and IB-related books, and the final <Revision> was derived through consultation and interview with a group of experts consisting of science majors, IB experts, IB World School teachers, and IB coordinators. In this process, the implications of the MYP unit design framework for our curriculum were explored. Results As a result, first, MYP designs instruction centering on the unit, so it is necessary to structure the unit that can clarify the characteristics of the unit in the curriculum composition and reveal what students expect as a result of the unit s learning. Second, MYP instruction is based on concept-based learning for deep understanding in the structure of knowledge, so it is necessary to think about cross-curricular key concepts based on the Korean context, setting related concepts, and teaching methods to explore concepts in everyday contexts. Third, ATL, which learns how to learn, needs to be emphasized as a way to develop learning initiative along with the setting of ATL suitable for the Korean context and curriculum knowledge. Fourth, MYP supports course-based assessment so that continuous and specific learning is achieved through the consistency of learning and assessments emphasized in our curriculum by matching subject goals and assessment criteria. Conclusions By applying the 2015 revised middle school curriculum to the MYP s unit design framework, it is enhancing the direction of the development of the unit-centered curriculum that develops higher-order thinking skills through deep understanding and exploration, concept-based learning beyond factual knowledge, and future competencies of learners."

Detailed investigations should be conducted to achieve best inference speed-accuracy trade-off prior to implementing a single neural network, which handles multiple tasks. In this research, the performance comparison among EfficientNet, ResNet101, VGG16, ResNet50 and MobilenetV2 on the Berkeley Driving Dataset (BDD100K) for autonomous driving using multi-tasking architecture are provided. Backbones that offer best time-accuracy trade-off for multi-task learning are evaluated. Implemented architecture contains three most crucial tasks in self-driving operations, object detection, drivable area segmentation and lane detection. EfficientNet based model showed the best mAP on the object detection task, as well as on the segmentation tasks, extracting both the long and wide roads with accurate lane lines.

These algorithms commonly used loss functions and evaluation indices like the mean square error (MSE) which were not originally designed for SHM problems. An updated loss function which was specifically constructed for deep-learningbased structural damage detection problems has been proposed in this study. By tuning the coefficients of the loss function, the weights for damage localization and quantification can be adapted to the real situation and the deep learning network can avoid unnecessary iterations on damage localization and focus on the damage severity identification. To prove efficiency of the proposed method, structural damage detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was conducted on a truss bridge model. Results showed that the validation curve with the updated loss function converged faster than the traditional MSE. Data augmentation was conducted to improve the anti-noise ability of the proposed method. For reducing the training time, the normalized modal strain energy change (NMSEC) was extracted, and the principal component analysis (PCA) was adopted for dimension reduction. The results showed that the training time was reduced by 90% and the damage identification accuracy could also have a slight increase. Furthermore, the effect of different modes and elements on the training dataset was also analyzed. The proposed method could greatly improve the performance for structural damage detection on both the training time and detection accuracy."

This paper considers the color distribution and shape information of leaf diseases, and designs two deep leaning networks in training the leaf diseases. In the first step, color distribution of input image is analyzed for possible diseases. In the second step, the image is first partitioned into small segments using mean shift clustering, and the color information of each segment is inspected by the proposed Color Network. When a segment is determined as disease, the shape parameters of the segment are extracted and inspected by proposed Shape Network to classify the leaf disease types in the third step.

In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based K-means vertex clustering algorithm as a method to reduce the execution time in the app by reducing the size of the data by reducing the number of vertices in the 3D mesh data within the range that does not cause a problem in visibility. First, our proposed method obtains refined vertex feature information through a deep learning encoder-decoder based model. And second, the method was simplified by grouping similar vertices through K-means vertex clustering using feature information. As a result of the experiment, when the vertices of various underground facilities were reduced by 30% with the proposed method, the 3D image model was slightly deformed, but there was no missing part, so there was no problem in checking it in the app."

In order to solve this social problem, we suggest pose detection that can have the people who have deleterious postures be notified. By using nowadays advanced computer vision techniques, in this paper we suggest the posture recognition module to enhance our quality of life. While most posture recognition recognizes only one person's posture, we made our pipeline to perform posture recognition for multiple people through images obtained through a single camera. One of the big problems in measuring people's postures is that it is necessary to distinguish the various body structures and postures of people. For this, posture images and labeling of various people are required. We created pose images of people of various body types through images of a small number of people through skeleton-based coordinates augmentation. We made a posture classifier using various models and observed the improvement of augmentation performance for each model. Through this, we found that the postures of various people can be measured using a relatively small data set. In particular, for deep-learning models that require a lot of data, generalization performance was greatly improved."

In addition, we add weight factors to the proposed model to compare the root mean square error of the direction vector."

SSTNet is composed by spatial attention probability fused model (SAF) and sequential transformer network (STNet). SAF enforces cross-modal state into visual clues in reinforcement learning. It encodes semantic information about observed objects, as well as spatial information about their location, which jointly exploiting image inter-relations. STNet generates (imagines) the next observations and makes action inference of the aspects most relevant to the target. It decodes the image intra-relations. This way, the agent learns to understand the causality between navigation actions and dynamic changes in observations. SSTNet is conditioned on an auto-regressive model on the desired reward, past states, actions, and knowledge graph. The whole navigation framework considers the local and global visual information, as well as time sequential information. Thus, it allows the agent to navigate towards the sought-after object effectively. We evaluate our model on the AI2THOR framework show that our method attains at least $10\%$ improvement of average success rate over most state-of-the-art models.

STAR-24K: A Public Dataset for Space Common Target Detection,2022,"['Public dataset', 'space target detection', 'deep learning', 'computer vision']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The target detection algorithm based on supervised learning is the current mainstream algorithm for target detection. A high-quality dataset is the prerequisite for the target detection algorithm to obtain good detection performance. The larger the number and quality of the dataset, the stronger the generalization ability of the model, that is, the dataset determines the upper limit of the model learning. The convolutional neural network optimizes the network parameters in a strong supervision method. The error is calculated by comparing the predicted frame with the manually labeled real frame, and then the error is passed into the network for continuous optimization. Strongly supervised learning mainly relies on a large number of images as models for continuous learning, so the number and quality of images directly affect the results of learning. This paper proposes a dataset STAR-24K (meaning a dataset for Space TArget Recognition with more than 24,000 images) for detecting common targets in space. Since there is currently no publicly available dataset for space target detection, we extracted some pictures from a series of channels such as pictures and videos released by the official websites of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (The European Space Agency) and expanded them to 24,451 pictures. We evaluate popular object detection algorithms to build a benchmark. Our STAR-24K dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/Zzz-zcy/STAR-24K."

Main goal of the proposed method is to reduce the discrepancy between the target and the source domain face images, which ultimately improves FR performances. The proposed method is based on the Domain Adatation network (DAN) using an MMD loss function to reduce the discrepancy between domains. In order to train more effectively, we develop a novel loss function learning strategy in which MMD loss and cross-entropy loss functions are adopted by using different weights according to the progress of each epoch during the learning. The proposed weight adoptation focuses on the training of the source domain in the initial learning phase to learn facial feature information such as eyes, nose, and mouth. After the initial learning is completed, the resulting feature information is used to training a deep network using the target domain images. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, FR performances were evaluated with pretrained model trained only with CASIA-webface (source images) and fine-tuned model trained only with FERETs gallery (target images) under the same FR scenarios. The experimental results showed that the proposed semi-supervised domain adaptation can be improved by 24.78% compared to the pre-trained model and 28.42% compared to the fine-tuned model. In addition, the proposed method outperformed other state-of-the-arts domain adaptation approaches by 9.41%."

Originally, image deblurring techniques have been studied using traditional optimization techniques. Then with the recent attention on deep learning, deblurring methods based on convolutional neural networks have been actively proposed. However, most of them have been developed while focusing on better performance. Therefore, it is not easy to use in real situations due to the speed of their algorithms.

Accuracy evaluation of liver and tumor auto-segmentation in CT images using 2D CoordConv DeepLab V3+ model in radiotherapy,2022,"['Liver', 'Tumor', 'Auto segmentation', '2D CoordConv DeepLab V3+', 'Deep-learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Medical image segmentation is the most important task in radiation therapy. Especially, when segmenting medical images, the liver is one of the most difficult organs to segment because it has various shapes and is close to other organs. Therefore, automatic segmentation of the liver in computed tomography (CT) images is a difficult task. Since tumors also have low contrast in surrounding tissues, and the shape, location, size, and number of tumors vary from patient to patient, accurate tumor segmentation takes a long time. In this study, we propose a method algorithm for automatically segmenting the liver and tumor for this purpose. As an advantage of setting the boundaries of the tumor, the liver and tumor were automatically segmented from the CT image using the 2D CoordConv DeepLab V3+ model using the CoordConv layer. For tumors, only cropped liver images were used to improve accuracy. Additionally, to increase the segmentation accuracy, augmentation, preprocess, loss function, and hyperparameter were used to find optimal values. We compared the CoordConv DeepLab v3+ model using the CoordConv layer and the DeepLab V3+ model without the CoordConv layer to determine whether they affected the segmentation accuracy. The data sets used included 131 hepatic tumor segmentation (LiTS) challenge data sets (100 train sets, 16 validation sets, and 15 test sets). Additional learned data were tested using 15 clinical data from Seoul St. Mary's Hospital. The evaluation was compared with the study results learned with a two-dimensional deep learning-based model. Dice values without the CoordConv layer achieved 0.965 ± 0.01 for liver segmentation and 0.925 ± 0.04 for tumor segmentation using the LiTS data set. Results from the clinical data set achieved 0.927 ± 0.02 for liver division and 0.903 ± 0.05 for tumor division. The dice values using the CoordConv layer achieved 0.989 ± 0.02 for liver segmentation and 0.937 ± 0.07 for tumor segmentation using the LiTS data set. Results from the clinical data set achieved 0.944 ± 0.02 for liver division and 0.916 ± 0.18 for tumor division. The use of CoordConv layers improves the segmentation accuracy. The highest of the most recently published values were 0.960 and 0.749 for liver and tumor division, respectively. However, better performance was achieved with 0.989 and 0.937 results for liver and tumor, which would have been used with the algorithm proposed in this study. The algorithm proposed in this study can play a useful role in treatment planning by improving contouring accuracy and reducing time when segmentation evaluation of liver and tumor is performed. And accurate identification of liver anatomy in medical imaging applications, such as surgical planning, as well as radiotherapy, which can leverage the findings of this study, can help clinical evaluation of the risks and benefits of liver intervention."

With the development of deep learning technology, learning model vulnerabilities for adversarial attacks continue to be reported. However, studies on countermeasures against poisoning attacks that inject malicious data during learning are insufficient. The conventional countermeasure against poisoning attacks has a limitation in that it is necessary to perform a separate detection and removal operation by examining the training data each time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a technique for reducing the attack success rate by applying modifications to the training data and inference data without a separate detection and removal process for the poison data. The One-shot kill poison attack, a clean label poison attack proposed in previous studies, was used as an attack model. The attack performance was confirmed by dividing it into a general attacker and an intelligent attacker according to the attacker's attack strategy. According to the experimental results, when the proposed defense mechanism is applied, the attack success rate can be reduced by up to 65% compared to the conventional method."

Here, the instance segmentation is to divide objects within the same class, and the background removal is to obtain learning data composed only of the pure object area.

Automatic generation of synthetic datasets from a city digital twin for use in the instance segmentation of building facades,2022,"['synthetic dataset', 'city digital twin', 'instance segmentation', 'building facade', 'deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The extraction and integration of building facade data are necessary for the development of information infrastructure for urban environments. However, existing methods for parsing building facades based on semantic segmentation have difficulties in distinguishing individual instances of connected buildings. Manually collecting and annotating instances of building facades in large datasets is time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the recent development and use of city digital twins (CDTs), massive high-quality digital assets of buildings have been created. These assets make it possible to generate high-quality and cost-effective synthetic datasets that can replace real-world ones as training sets for the supervised learning-based instance segmentation of building facades. In this study, we developed a novel framework that can automatically produce synthetic datasets from a CDT. An auto-generation system for synthetic street views was built by rendering city digital assets in a game engine, while the system auto-generated the instance annotations for building facades. The hybrid dataset HSRBFIA, along with various subsets containing different proportions of synthetic and real data, were used to train deep learning models for facade instance segmentation. In our experiments, two types of synthetic data (CDT-based and virtual-based) were compared, and the results showed that the CDT synthetic data were more effective in boosting deep learning training with real-world images compared with the virtual synthetic data (no real-world counterparts). By swapping a certain portion of the real data with the proposed CDT synthetic images, the performance could almost match what is achievable when using the real-world training set."

In general, the CCTVs in the tunnel are installed at a low height as well as near by the moving vehicles due to the spatial limitation of tunnel structure, so a severe perspective effect takes place in the distance of installed CCTV and moving vehicles. Because of this effect, conventional CCTV-based accident detection systemsin tunnel are known in general to be very hard to achieve the performance in detection of unexpected accidents such as stop or reversely moving vehicles, person on the road and fires, especially far from 100 m. Therefore, in this study, the region of interest is setup and a new concept of inverse perspective transformation technique is introduced. Since moving vehicles in the transformed image is enlarged proportionally to the distance from CCTV, it is possible to achieve consistency in object detection andidentification of actual speed of moving vehicles in distance. To show this aspect, two datasets in the same conditions are composed with the original and the transformed images of CCTV in tunnel, respectively. A comparison of variation of appearance speed and size of moving vehicles in distance are made. Then, the performances of the object detection in distance are compared with respect to the both trained deep-learning models. As a result, the model case with the transformed images are able to achieve consistent performance in object and accident detections in distance even by 200 m."

Since the deep learning model based on the convolutional neural network has low accuracy for classifying voice recording in segment units, the Perceiver model, which is a variation of the transformer neural network used in natural language processing, was adapted. The input data was generated through MFCC feature extraction, attention and transform layers were modified to be suitable for voice recording classification. Also, parameters were optimized. In the experiment, the proposed method was trained as a constructed dataset and the classification performance was analyzed in the audio segment units and the entire audio file units. As a result, 83.47% accuracy was achieved for each segment unit and 95.19% accuracy was achieved for the entire audio file."

However, it is hard to obtain well-annotated labels because of their diverse appearances such as size and shape. Also, it takes expensive costs for labeling. In this paper, we performed unsupervised liver segmentation in unlabeled Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets using deep learning. To generate labels of MRI, the domain adaptation technique is applied with CT images containing well-annotated labels. We trained the segmentation model with the MRI dataset which is transferred from CT images and evaluated the model on real MRI datasets.

Comments on Translation in a Translation Class as an Active Literacy Act,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study explores the significance of translation comments as an active practice of literacy act among the advantages of applying peer feedback in a translation classroom. Pym mentioned that translation is a process of generation and selection, a problem-solving process(2003), meaning it has to solve the problems between two languages occurring during the translation. In order to translate, translators have to study and understand the source text, and they use what they have learned or known in the process of translating the source text into a target language and search for the information they do not know and apply their newly acquired knowledge for translation. Then all translation acts are literacy acts as literacy consist of learning and understanding and writing. In particular, sense-to-sense translation can be read as an active literacy act considering that a translator has to understand the entire context and finds a deep meaning by putting all related information together and translating the text not partially but sythetically. Comments on translation are more active literacy acts. Comments consist of recognizing and understanding problems that appear in the translated texts, and then finding the cause of the problem and solving them. Comments on translation are to find ways to solve problems through bilingual learning, cultures, and specific topics on the source text and deciding the level of target readers, editing, or writing through which commenters enhance their self-learning skills. Peer feedback in the translation class is an act of giving comments by fellow students to the other students’ translated texts, and when this method of peer feedback is applied, students actively engage in literacy in the process of translating and commenting. Therefore, comments can be seen as critical literacy because the commenters in the translation class read both source texts and target texts, find differences between two texts, evaluate them, edit translated texts and then express their opinions. While sense-to-sense translation is the ability to synthesize situations in translation, comments on translation contribute to developing critical capability in terms of realizing critical literacy. From the point of view of problem-solving, the act of translating is a process of problem-solving, and the act of commenting becomes a more active act of problem-solving. Therefore, creative problem-solving solutions can come out through this learning. Today's expanded concept of literacy is involved in various purposes of life. Given that the ultimate goal of all literacy acts is the practice in society, comments in the translation class are active actions that students practice what they have learned."

Furthermore, this study aims to reduce the time and effort needed to prepare a huge amount of image data for this highly data-driven process by using generative adversarial networks (GANs).Methods A three-class classification method was implemented to identify the infestation stages, namely, uninfested kernel, larva stage, and pupa stage. The approach was based on features extraction from the deepest pooling layer of a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architecture—the Xception, and using support vector machine as the classifier. Moreover, a GAN model was proposed to synthesize artificial X-ray images.Results The overall F1-score produced by the model was improved from 0.86 to 0.91 when the GAN-synthesized dataset additionally supported the training data.

Makeup transfer can be divided into a traditional image processing-based method and a deep learning-based method. In particular, in deep learning-based methods, many studies based on Generative Adversarial Networks have been performed. However, both methods have disadvantages in that the resulting image is unnatural, the result of makeup conversion is not clear, and it is smeared or heavily influenced by the makeup style face image. In order to express the clear boundary of makeup and to alleviate the influence of makeup style facial images, this study divides the makeup area and calculates the loss function using HoG (Histogram of Gradient). HoG is a method of extracting image features through the size and directionality of edges present in the image. Through this, we propose a makeup transfer network that performs robust learning on edges.By comparing the image generated through the proposed model with the image generated through BeautyGAN used as the base model, it was confirmed that the performance of the model proposed in this study was superior, and the method of using facial information that can be additionally presented as a future study."

Recently, the introduction of a system to improve the performance of players and reduce injuries by introducing an artificial intelligence system is being discussed. The scope and methods of using artificial intelligence are being applied in various ways. Various results are derived through analysis and acquisition of machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, visual recognition, and voice recognition. In this study, among various application methods of artificial intelligence, methods for preventing and utilizing players' injuries in volleyball games were reviewed. As a result of the discussion, in order to analyze the landing motion of players after jumping in a volleyball game where a lot of data is generated, data is generated through visual recognition and motion analysis of spike serve, blocking, and spike motion, and artificial intelligence learns it through deep learning. It is believed that standards will be established to prevent injuries. It is thought that this method can be used not only in volleyball but also in various sports events, and continuous data acquisition can prevent injuries to various body parts including the shoulder as well as knee injuries in advance."
Neural Joint Source-Channel Coding via Bernoulli Latent Straight-Through Estimator,2022,"['Autoencoder', 'joint source-channel coding (JSCC)', 'straight-through (ST) estimator', 'variational autoen- coder (VAE)', 'variational inference for Monte Carlo objectives (VIMCO).']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Under infinite block length, from Shannon’s sep-aration theorem, it is well-known that by independent designof source coding and channel coding, the optimal throughput –the channel capacity – can be reached with careful design ofthe corresponding functionalities. However, when restricted tofinite block length, the separation theorem does not necessarilyhold, and hence joint source-channel coding (JSCC) theoremhas been raised as an alternative strategy for achieving thecapacity of the channel. However, as JSCC formulates highlynon-convex problem which cannot be directly solved analytically,recently, deep learning has been proposed as a key enabler forJSCC. While most work on deep-learning-based JSCC focusedon transmission of continuous signals through wireless channels,we focus in this paper the case of information-theoretic channel,namely binary symmetric channel, which can give useful insightson information-theoretic perspective on JSCC. Unlike recentwork on deep-learning-based, or neural, JSCC for discretechannels that considered score function estimator to train theJSCC, in this paper, we improve the performance of neuralJSCC by estimating the gradient more precisely as comparedto the previous approach. Key idea is to consider soft codewordduring training to enable path-wise gradient estimator which isproven to have lower variance than the score-function estimator.Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets showthat the proposed neural JSCC outperforms the previous workon JSCC for discrete channels, validating the effectiveness of theproposed gradient computation technique."

Materials and Methods: A CNN model, which is an artificial intelligence method, was utilized. The model was trained and tested by applying 5-fold cross-validation to a dataset of 148 healthy and 148 inflamed sinus images. The CNN model was implemented using the PyTorch library of the Python programming language. A receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted, and the area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values for both imaging techniques were calculated to evaluate the model. Results: The average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model in diagnosing sinusitis from PRs were 75.7%, 75.7%, and 75.7%, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the deep-learning system in diagnosing sinusitis from CBCT images were 99.7%, 100%, and 99.3%, respectively. Conclusion: The diagnostic performance of the CNN for maxillary sinusitis from PRs was moderately high, whereas it was clearly higher with CBCT images. Three-dimensional images are accepted as the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis; therefore, this was not an unexpected result.

위성 영상을 위한 경량화된 CNN 기반의 보간 기술 연구,2022,"['Interpolation', 'Super-resolution', 'Remote sensing', 'Satellite images']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In order to obtain satellite image products using the image transmitted to the ground station after capturing the satellite images, many image pre/post-processing steps are involved. During the pre/post-processing, when converting from level 1R images to level 1G images, geometric correction is essential. An interpolation method necessary for geometric correction is inevitably used, and the quality of the level 1G images is determined according to the accuracy of the interpolation method. Also, it is crucial to speed up the interpolation algorithm by the level processor. In this paper, we proposed a lightweight CNN-based interpolation method required for geometric correction when converting from level 1R to level 1G. The proposed method doubles the resolution of satellite images and constructs a deep learning network with a lightweight deep convolutional neural network for fast processing speed. In addition, a feature map fusion method capable of improving the image quality of multispectral (MS) bands using panchromatic (PAN) band information was proposed. The images obtained through the proposed interpolation method improved by about 0.4 dB for the PAN image and about 4.9 dB for the MS image in the quantitative peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) index compared to the existing deep learning-based interpolation methods. In addition, it was confirmed that the time required to acquire an image that is twice the resolution of the 36,500×36,500 input image based on the PAN image size is improved by about 1.6 times compared to the existing deep learning-based interpolation method."

The goal of this study is to propose a Korean language educational model for culture and pragmatics based on the first season of the web-drama series “Office Watch.” In order to accomplish this goal, this study extracts and analyzes three types of elements found in the series, which are (1) commonplace cultural aspects such as nunchi, age, fandom/fangirling, and confession culture, (2) sociolinguistic elements such as terms of address, mixed usage of honorific levels, aegyo, code-switching, and (3) pragmatic elements such as command speech act, refusal speech act, conversational implicature, and complimentresponse speech act. Next, the study suggests educational proposals which use web-dramas, categorizing them as online pre-learning, offline classroom learning, and online follow-up learning.Through the online pre-learning, students watch videos individually and follow the plot and narrative themselves. Afterward, they participate in an offline classroom, gaining an understanding of cultural, sociolinguistic, and pragmatic aspects of Korean culture and compare these elements with the cultures from their home country. Lastly, through the online follow-up learning course, students write reports about Korean culture and apply the speech-act strategies learned in class to real-life situations. This educational proposal aims to stimulate students’ interest and raise motivation in their studies while encouraging a deep understanding of Korean culture and their successful communication. The fact that the Korean language education field currently lacks culture- and pragmatics-based studies using web-dramas further adds significance to this research."

At the end of 2020, a fake video of British Queen Elizabeth Ⅱ greeting and dancing for Christmas was released. Also, a deepfake video that former U.S. President Obama called President Trump “a total and complete dipshit” was disclosed to alarm the danger of deepfakes in 2018. Recently, even in South Korea, with the presidential election just around the corner, the ruling party posted on its official YouTube channel a deepfake video to the effect that a former Korean President declared support for a presidential candidate. The controversy over the video, however, made the party take down it from the channel.If a deepfake video about a candidate is posted on YouTube ahead of the election, which negatively or positively affects voters’ choice of candidates, it may pose a serious threat to democracy that is based on fair elections. Therefore, California and Texas in the United States have passed election laws regulating an act of distributing a deepfake video which may injure a candidate or influence the result of an election.The term “deepfake”, which refers to a fake video, is the compound word of “deep learning” and “fake,” and can be said to be “manipulated images, audio or video, designed to make the altered media seem authentic.” However, the California law regulating deepfakes immediately before an election is criticized on the ground that it is not a narrowly tailored restriction on freedom of speech to achieve the compelling government interest such as fair elections. It has also been criticized because it can be rarely applied to a case due to the actual malice rule of the U.S. Supreme Court. According to this criticism of the law, it is more desirable to regulate deepfakes with the defamation or copyright laws. Meanwhile, some critics argue that the Texas anti-deepfake law is unconstitutional not only because it does not prescribe for the actual malice rule, but also because it does not exempt its application to parody or satire.Recently, the National Election Commission in South Korea promulgated the “Standard for the Application of the Law on Deepfake Videos” and issued an authoritative interpretation that an act of posting a deepfake video on the Internet without indicating that it is “a deepfake video (AI OOO)” violates Article 250 of the Public Official Election Act. However, there is no expressive legal ground under the law to display that it is a deepfake video. In addition, this requirement may cause a chilling effect on freedom of speech because it is a prior restraint. In the meantime, it seems reasonable to conclude that no additional criminal punishment law needs to be passed because the current law punishing an act of publishing false statement of facts during an election can adequately regulate deepfake videos although a bill to criminalize deepfakes was introduced in the National Assembly."

The quality of the reconstructed depth maps and the corresponding point clouds is directly influenced by the spatial resolution of the 3D volume. Consequently, these methods produce point clouds with sparse local regions because of the lack of the memory required to encode a high volume of information. Here, we apply the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module in MVS methods to obtain dense feature maps with multiscale, long-range, contextual information using high receptive fields. For a given 3D volume with the same spatial resolution as that in the MVS methods, the dense feature maps from the ASPP module encoded with superior information can produce dense point clouds without a high memory footprint. Furthermore, we propose a 3D loss for training the MVS networks, which improves the predicted depth values by 24.44%. The ASPP module provides state-of-the-art qualitative results by constructing relatively dense point clouds, which improves the DTU MVS dataset benchmarks by 2.25% compared with those achieved in the previous MVS methods."

In this paper, the measured SAR images are translated to the simulation-like SAR images using CycleGAN which showed high performance in the field of image-to-image translation. The translated SAR images are used as the inputs of the network trained on simulated SAR images. Furthermore, unlike traditional SAR target recognition algorithms using only amplitude of SAR images, the proposed method is based on a complex-valued network using both amplitude and phase data."

When the ESS is operated at high temperature for a long time, aging is caused owing to deterioration, and hence, stable operation is required. Among the recent 28 fires, 15 of them occurred during charging and resting. Because rapid temperature and humidity changes occur during charging and discharging, it is important to predict the trend of change. This study predicts ESS operation patterns through an artificial intelligence-based prediction algorithm, and also diagnoses ESS failures through a supervised learning-based confusion matrix. When a failure pattern is found in the ESS, a method to reduce damage through air conditioner control is studied."

As COVID-19 spread globally, the World Health Organization upgraded it to a pandemic in March 2020. In addition to solving the problem of shortage of medical personnel, rapid and accurate classification of infected patients emerged as an important issue. Therefore, we propose a deep learning-based chest X-ray image reading model that can notify the doctor whether the patient is infected. The goal is to achieve multiclass classification, which not only classifies COVID-19 infections, but also other lung diseases to help the medical community. The proposed method is a combination model. It involves pre-processing the chest X-ray image using the image augmentation method and various convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The purpose of the proposed method is to classify COVID-19, normal people, and viral pneumonia appropriately. Overall, 15,153 X-ray images were used in the study. By using the proposed method, we obtained a model with high accuracy through improved image data. Characteristically, some models tend to detect COVID-19 and pneumonia properly. Finally, an ensemble model was created using models made by the proposed method. Eventually, we obtained a high accuracy (0.981) model for detecting infections appropriately."

To monitor the emotional state of driver, most works focus on the Facial Expression Recognition. However, there are many factors that prevent the driver from revealing emotions on his/her face while driving. To address this, we proposed a deep learning-based algorithm to recognize the real emotion hidden behind the expression. Proposed algorithm is consisted by FER and HER. The FER model refers to the state-of-the-art CNN structures to recognize the state of facial expression. The HER model fuses the recognized state of facial expression with bio-physiology signal, EDA, to recognize even the hidden emotional state of driver. For reliable results, we define the driver’s emotion categories and conduct human-in-the-loop experiments to acquire the data. From the experimental results, our fusing approach achieves 114% increase in accuracy compared to using only the facial expressions and achieves 86.8% recognition accuracy in recognizing the induced emotions to the driver in a driving situation."

Although existing supervised learning-based object detection methods can recognize personal mobilities, processing for data collection, labeling, and training is time-consuming and expensive whenever new forms of personal mobilities come to the market. Anomaly detection-based methods are proposed to learn normal patterns and detect abnormal patterns without prior training. This study proposes a new approach to personal mobility user recognition using deep learning-based anomaly detection in dynamically changing driving environments. The proposed approach consists of Human detection, Cropping and Anomaly detection modules. The Human detection module detects human regions. The Cropping module removes unnecessary areas and performs a preprocessing. The memory-based Anomaly detection module distinguishes between pedestrians and personal mobility users. Based on the proposed anomaly detection method, augmented reality (AR) visualization in the head-up display (HUD) is proposed for effective driving assistance. Since it is possible to distinguish pedestrians and mobility users effectively, the AR HUD-based visualization can assist the driver to pay more attention to the mobility user."

This knowledge means knowing from direct and individual 'mystery experiences' by intuition and inspiration. Therefore, territorialism refers to the realization of intrinsic intuition that encompasses knowledge of essential realities such as ultimate and divinity, not knowledge given by the absolutist as inertia. For this reason, the gnostic ‘experience’ has the meaning of ‘insight’.In order to establish the theory of Gnosticism salvation that realizes the fundamental ‘The One’ through ‘psychē’ and ‘nous’ and returns to ultimate absoluteness, firstly humans must make this ‘psychē’ and ‘nous’ to their essence. In addition, the ‘psychē’ must be a holy vessel with Zen or Seongseon with philosophical completeness. Furthermore that ‘nous’ should have a priori and original innate nature, not an acquired recognition of the ultimate identity of ‘the One’ through experience and learning.Religious iIdeology in East Asia clearly represent this Gnostically nature.The Buddhist theory of Mahayana Buddhism shows that the essence of human existence can lead to liberation through enlightenment Moreover, Confucianism also has a theory of cultivation of insight into the fundamental sense of purity based on the theory of Mencius’ Seong-seon.

However, as studies using various methods exist, a problem arises, in which the exact prediction result of the sequence is unknown. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an All Enzyme Commission (AEC) algorithm. The proposed AEC is an algorithm that executes various prediction methods and integrates the results when predicting sequences. This algorithm uses duplicates to give more weights when duplicate values are obtained from multiple methods. The largest value, among the final prediction result values for each method to which the weight is applied, is the final prediction result.

We used the FreeSurfer deep-learning tool of U-Net to obtain the volumes of the subcortical limbic structures, including the MB, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, septal nuclei, fornix, and nucleus accumbens. MB atrophy was considered to be present when the MB volume was decreased relative to the healthy controls.Results MB atrophy was present in 18 (26.1%) of the 69 patients with TLE and HS. Among the clinical characteristics, the mean age at seizure onset was higher (25.5 vs. 15.9 years, p= 0.027) and the median duration of epilepsy was shorter (149 vs. 295 months, p=0.003) in patients with than without MB atrophy. The basal forebrain (0.0185% vs. 0.0221%, p=0.004) and septal nuclei (0.0062% vs. 0.0075%, p=0.003) in the ipsilateral hemisphere of HS were smaller in the patients with MB atrophy.Conclusions We observed ipsilateral MB atrophy in about one-quarter of patients with TLE and HS. The severity of subcortical limbic structure abnormalities was greater in patients without MB atrophy. These findings suggest that MB atrophy in TLE with HS is not rare, but it has little clinical significance."
Lightweight Attention-Guided Network with Frequency Domain Reconstruction for High Dynamic Range Image Fusion,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Multi-exposure high dynamic range (HDR) image reconstruction, the task of reconstructing an HDR image from multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images in a dynamic scene, often produces ghosting artifacts caused by camera motion and moving objects and also cannot deal with washed-out regions due to over or under-exposures. While there has been many deep-learning-based methods with motion estimation to alleviate these problems, they still have limitations for severely moving scenes. They also require large parameter counts, especially in the case of state-of-the-art methods that employ attention modules. To address these issues, we propose a frequency domain approach based on the idea that the transform domain coefficients inherently involve the global information from whole image pixels to cope with large motions. Specifically we adopt Residual Fast Fourier Transform (RFFT) blocks, which allows for global interactions of pixels. Moreover, we also employ Depthwise Overparametrized convolution (DO-conv) blocks, a convolution in which each input channel is convolved with its own 2D kernel, for faster convergence and performance gains. We call this LFFNet (Lightweight Frequency Fusion Network), and experiments on the benchmarks show reduced ghosting artifacts and improved performance up to 0.6dB tonemapped PSNR compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. Our architecture also requires fewer parameters and converges faster in training."

This is because the autonomous driving system can shift a new paradigm for car driving environments (e.g., watching TV while driving a car). Accordingly, object detection (OD) is very important to achieve the ADAS framework since interpreting the visual information (e.g., object classification and its properties) closes the relationship with morphological image analysis and understanding of the classification as well as properties of the object within the image sequence. Recently, the proliferation of deep-learning-based OD frameworks, the advanced of the inexpensive camera attached to the vehicle, and the increasing need for automated video analysis.

To overcome the limited scenario, we introduced a novel preprocessing method to enhance the images obtained from the low illumination environments. Furthermore, we compared the result of Precision, Recall, and F1 score from the previous DL-based OD algorithm and the proposed method. The proposed method outperforms 15.87% in recall, and 15.93% F1 score than the previous object detection method.

To solve this problem, deep learning-based image stitching technologies have recently been studied, but there are still many problems when there are few overlapping areas between images or large parallax. In addition, there is a limit to complete supervised learning because labeled ground-truth panorama images cannot be obtained in a real environment. Therefore, we produced three fisheye images with different camera centers and corresponding ground truth image through carla simulator that is widely used in the autonomous driving field. We propose image stitching model that creates a 360° panorama image with the produced fisheye image.

Usually, presentation attackers steal a genuine user’s biometric image and use it for presentation attack. In recent years, reconstruction attack and adversarial attack can generate high-quality fake images, and have high attack success rates. However, their attack rates degrade remarkably after image shooting. Methods: In order to comprehensively analyze the threat of presentation attack to palmprint recognition system, this paper makes six palmprint presentation attack datasets. The datasets were tested on texture coding-based recognition methods and deep learning-based recognition methods. Results and conclusion: The experimental results show that the presentation attack caused by the leakage of the original image has a high success rate and a great threat; while the success rates of reconstruction attack and adversarial attack decrease significantly."

Electronic problems such as circuit failures are easy to diagnose on the product itself, but mechanical defects and faults are difficult to diagnose. Since acoustic signals generated from a machine include inherent operating characteristics, the unwanted mechanical faults can be diagnosed by analyzing different patterns between normal and fault signals. In this study, the mechanical failure diagnosis of a commercial portable air conditioner has been implemented based on a deep learning-based image classification technique. Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to effectively analyze the frequency characteristics that occur in the event of machine failures, and then the fault status of the air conditioner is examined by classifying the extracted spectrogram images through convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed method shows a precise fault diagnosis without additional devices and can be effectively applied for fault diagnostic algorithms of various home appliances."

Conventional crack detection methods which include visual inspection and non-destructive equipment, are typically limited to a small region and require time-consuming processes. Recently, to reduce the human intervention in the inspections, various researchers have sought computer vision-based crack analyses: One class is filter-based methods, which effectively transforms the image to detect crack edges. The other class is using deep-learning algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks have shown high precision in identifying cracks in an image. However, when the objective is to classify not only the existence of crack but also the types of cracks, only a few studies have been reported, limiting their practical use. Thus, the presented study develops an image processing procedure that detects cracks and classifies crack types; whether the image contains a crazing-type, single crack, or multiple cracks. The properties and steps in the algorithm have been developed using field-obtained images. Subsequently, the algorithm is validated from additional 227 images obtained from an open database. For test datasets, the proposed algorithm showed accuracy of 92.8% in average. In summary, the developed algorithm can precisely classify crazing-type images, while some single crack images may misclassify into multiple cracks, yielding conservative results. As a result, the successful results of the presented study show potentials of using vision-based technologies for providing crack information with reduced human intervention."

This is an inefficient method in terms of time and cost to train multi-speaker or personalized TTS models. The voice cloning method uses a speaker encoder model to make the TTS model of a new speaker. Through the trained speaker encoder model, a speaker embedding vector representing the timbre of the new speaker is created from the small speech data of the new speaker that is not used for training. In this paper, we propose a multi-speaker TTS system to which voice cloning is applied. The proposed TTS system consists of a speaker encoder, synthesizer and vocoder. The speaker encoder applies the d-vector technique used in the speaker recognition field. The timbre of the new speaker is expressed by adding the d-vector derived from the trained speaker encoder as an input to the synthesizer.

Development of a Bayesian-based Uncertainty-aware Tool Wear Prediction Model in the End Milling Process,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Titanium alloy is one of the most widely used materials in various industries, such as aerospace, medical, and automotive industry because of its desirable mechanical properties. However, titanium alloy is also a difficult-to-cut material due to the low thermal conductivity and low specific heat. In particular, in an end milling process using titanium alloy, tool wear influences not only the cutting force but also material removal volume per a single tool as well as the quality of the material surface. Therefore, accurate tool wear prediction is necessary during an end milling process to improve product quality and replace the tool at an appropriate time. Furthermore, because the effects of tool wear prediction on the overall process are significant both in terms of cost and time, uncertainty-aware tool wear prediction should be performed. In this work, a deep learning-based tool wear prediction model, which uses a Bayesian approach, is proposed. First, a CNN-based architecture that integrates multi-scale information extracted from raw sensor measurement data, named deep multi-scale CNN (DMSCNN) is proposed. Second, using a Bayesian approach, DMSCNN is transformed into a probabilistic model that outputs a predictive distribution with uncertainty awareness. Experiments with data collected from the real-world end milling process with three distinct setups have proven the effectiveness of the proposed DMSCNN in tool wear prediction. In addition, Bayesian DMSCNN has shown promising results, outperforming existing comparative deterministic methods, as well as probabilistic methods for tool wear prediction."

These are used as reference or communication images in new spatial designs in various ways. Various photographs are representative media that express spatial design. However, the photographer's screen composition, viewing angle, and camera location are subjective and arbitrary; therefore, the complete expression of spatial information is limited. The existing method requires several images to capture the overall appearance of a space with a limited viewing angle. However, an indoor panoramic image photographed at 360° may represent the entire space as a single integrated image. (Method) There are two ways to acquire 360-panoramic images, such as photography and live-action rendering images through computers. This paper describes the technical method of the camera for each image archive and the actual indoor image archiving case. To apply the created 360-panoramic images, they were segmented into general images with existing angles of view. The segmented image is archived based on the information recognized through modules that recognize objects and the use of space using deep learning. Therefore, this study explains and demonstrates how to develop an interior design database by dividing it into 360 panoramic image input values taken by actual users. (Results) This paper proposes a method to develop an interior design database in a consistent and standardized manner by segmenting 360-panoramic images with arbitrarily selected angles and sizes. The 360-panoramic image was segmented using two visual criteria of the camera, which architects mainly use for interior design photography, and the segmented image was an indoor design reference image of size 1280(W)×720(H). The developed archive includes 800 360-panoramic images, 56,700 segmented interior design reference images, and tag, classification, and design information in the segmented images. (Conclusions) This study contributes to the easy storage and application of large and qualitative 360-panoramic image data in the field of interior architecture. In particular, it is expected to standardize the interior design reference storage method that people process in an ad-hoc manner. In the future, the range of information recognized in interior design images will be expanded to develop a method for applying the data stored in the design process. Therefore, not only spatial information and objects in space but also more qualitative design information will be defined, recognized, and expanded to archives where images can be classified. This study presents a method for segmenting a uniformly photographed 360-panoramic image, and defines the variables necessary for segmentation. Therefore, the user can segment various numbers of images according to their purpose and convenience."

In the Korean document summary using the summation similarity of sentences, the summation similarity of the sentences was regarded as the amount of sentence information, and the summary sentences were extracted by selecting important sentences based on this. However, the problem is that it does not take into account the various importance that each sentence contributes to the entire document. Therefore, in this study, we propose a document extraction summary method that provides a summary by selecting important sentences based on the amount of quantitative and semantic information in the sentence. As a result, the extracted sentence agreement was 58.56% and the ROUGE-L score was 34, which was superior to the method using only the combined similarity. Compared to the deep learning-based method, the extraction method is lighter, but the performance is similar. Through this, it was confirmed that the method of compressing information based on semantic similarity between sentences is an important approach in document extraction summary. In addition, based on the quickly extracted summary, the document generation summary step can be effectively performed."

Therefore, image-based virtual try-on technology involving neural networks using shopping mall costumes and images of people wearing thee costumes and the generation of new outfit images, has recently been the subject of numerous studies. Researchers have actively attempted to improve the dress performance in human images in various postures and directions, to preserve complex and detailed patterns and patterns of costumes virtually, and to improve dress performance outcomes in images in which part of the human body covers the costume. Normally, many studies focus mainly on t-shirts, whereas this study proposes a virtual try-on process for dresses with highly diverse and complex properties for use with fashion clothes. Such a dress try-on service should approximate the trying of a T-shirt, such as allowing the wearer to view the costume from various angles, clearly expressing the patterns or colors of the costume, and covering the body. In addition, various dress lengths should be expressed in the virtual try-on session. Here, the performance is improved by converting the size of the costume in an image to a size relative to the wearer. This is done because photos posted in a shopping mall are enlarged and provided regardless of the actual length, making it difficult to determine the actual length. This study uses learning by a deep-learning neural network using human and costume images and presents the results of virtual attire as experimental data."

However, there remain significant legal uncertainties in developing, training, and using large-scale language models. Accordingly, substantial efforts are required to resolve them. The legal issues of the large-scale language model analyzed in this Article are largely summarized in three points. First, there is an issue of collecting learning data through web-scraping. These practices involve multi-layered issues such as copyright and database producers’ rights and scope of fair use, interpretation of information and communication network infringement, anti-competitive prohibition and restriction of web-scraping and privacy violation through web-scraping. Second, it has been pointed out that the recent large-scale language models can memorize personal information contained in training data and reproducing it as it is. As a result, it is necessary to take appropriate de-identification or pseudonymization measures to prevent personal information from being included in the training data. Finally, the vast training data of the language model may include text reflecting existing biases or prejudices in society, discriminatory remarks, or hate speeches. As a result, as the use of the large-scale language model increases, the possibility of reproducing the inherent bias may also proportionally increase. However, the harm caused by the bias reflected in the language model has long-term, diffusive, and cultural characteristics, and it is difficult to specify individual victims. Thus, it is very difficult to legally regulate them. Accordingly, it inevitably relies heavily on self-regulation in accordance with the voluntary internal ethical principles established by AI developers or service providers. At the same time, various technical attempts are currently underway to prevent biases from being reflected in language models in training process or to remove biases reflected in language models."
Stock News Dataset Quality Assessment by Evaluating the Data Distribution and the Sentiment Prediction,2022,"['Stock Dataset', 'Stock Market News', 'News Impact', 'Stock Activities', 'Data Quality Assessment']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This work provides a reliable and classified stocks dataset merged with Saudi stock news. This dataset allows researchers to analyze and better understand the realities, impacts, and relationships between stock news and stock fluctuations. The data were collected from the Saudi stock market via the Corporate News (CN) and Historical Data Stocks (HDS) datasets. As their names suggest, CN contains news, and HDS provides information concerning how stock values change over time. Both datasets cover the period from 2011 to 2019, have 30,098 rows, and have 16 variables-four of which they share and 12 of which differ. Therefore, the combined dataset presented here includes 30,098 published news pieces and information about stock fluctuations across nine years. Stock news polarity has been interpreted in various ways by native Arabic speakers associated with the stock domain. Therefore, this polarity was categorized manually based on Arabic semantics. As the Saudi stock market massively contributes to the international economy, this dataset is essential for stock investors and analyzers. The dataset has been prepared for educational and scientific purposes, motivated by the scarcity of data describing the impact of Saudi stock news on stock activities. It will, therefore, be useful across many sectors, including stock market analytics, data mining, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. The data evaluation is applied by testing the data distribution of the categories and the sentiment prediction-the data distribution over classes and sentiment prediction accuracy. The results show that the data distribution of the polarity over sectors is considered a balanced distribution. The NB model is developed to evaluate the data quality based on sentiment classification, proving the data reliability by achieving 68% accuracy. So, the data evaluation results ensure dataset reliability, readiness, and high quality for any usage."

Along with the developments in the technological environment, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant changes to our lives. It has become important to come up with rapid and appropriate responses to environmental changes and unexpected crises. Accordingly, a more in-depth analysis of user needs based on face-to-face design reconsideration and objective data reflecting environmental changes is becoming more important within public design. In this context, Digital Twin (DT) is a parallel virtual environment model that responds to the physical environment and enables us to seek services that respond quickly to rapidly changing environments. The purpose of this study was to explore the applicability of DT in public facility design for the convenience and welfare of citizens.

Third, based on this, the public facility design stage was derived according to the DT maturity stage, and finally, the direction for DT utilization in public facility design was presented. (Results) The stage of DT maturity according to technological development and the stage of public facility design were derived. If the first stage of digitally replicating the appearance was limited to building a physical environment, the second stage was at a level where partial automatic control was possible. The third stage was the level of analyzing the current environment and predicting the design result with simulation through the virtual environment. The fourth stage included the construction of extended reality (XR) through deep learning. The last five stages can be organized into levels of controlling and changing XR. In addition, it was possible to organize the operational direction of public facility DT into public and environmental value-based, integrated, and complex DT operations, and user-centered design practices based on empirical data. (Conclusions) The implications and expected effects of this study are as follows. First, it is necessary to define the value standards of facilities when constructing DT for public facilities. Second, it is possible to create a space suitable for regional characteristics through DT networking and complex use. Third, it is possible to present an optimized environment by predicting various complex social problems using DTs based on objective data. Finally, it will be possible to provide faster and more flexible customized services through the use of DTs in public facilities.

CCTV 동영상과 IR 센서 기반 강설 및 결빙 상태 감지 기술,2022,"['Road safety', 'smart monitoring', 'snow removal', 'black-ice detection', 'machine learning', 'deep learning', 'convolutional neural networks']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"PURPOSES : Road surface conditions are vital to traffic safety, management, and operation. To ensure traffic operation and safety during periods of snow and ice during the winter, each local government allocates considerable resources for monitoring that rely on field-oriented manual work. Therefore, a smart monitoring and management system for autonomous snow removal that can rapidly respond to unexpected abrupt heavy snow and black ice in winter must be developed. This study addresses a smart technology for automatically monitoring and detecting road surface conditions in an experimental environment using convolutional neural networks based on a CCTV camera and infrared (IR) sensor data. METHODS : The proposed approach comprises three steps: obtaining CCTV videos and IR sensor data, processing the dataset acquired to apply deep learning based on convolutional neural networks, and training the learning model and validating it. The first step involves a large dataset comprising 12,626 images extracted from the acquired CCTV videos and the synchronized surface temperature data from the IR sensor. In the second step, image frames are extracted from the videos, and only foreground target images are extracted during preprocessing. Hence, only the area (each image measuring 500 × 500) of the asphalt road surface corresponding to the road surface is applied to construct an ideal dataset. In addition, the IR thermometer sensor data stored in the logger are used to calculate the road surface temperatures corresponding to the image acquisition time. The images are classified into three categories, i.e., normal, snow, and black-ice, to construct a training dataset. Under normal conditions, the images include dry and wet road conditions. In the final step, the learning process is conducted using the acquired dataset for deep learning and verification. The dataset contains 10,100 (80%) data points for deep learning and 2,526 (20%) points for verification. RESULTS : To evaluate the proposed approach, the loss, accuracy, and confusion matrix of the addressed model are calculated. The model loss refers to the loss caused by the estimated error of the model, where 0.0479 and 0.0401 are indicated in the learning and verification stages, respectively. Meanwhile, the accuracies are 97.82% and 98.00%, respectively. Based on various tests that involve adjusting the learning parameters, an optimized model is derived by generalizing the characteristics of the input image, and errors such as overfitting are resolved. This experiment shows that this approach can be used for snow and black-ice detections on roads. CONCLUSIONS : The approach introduced herein is feasible in road environments, such as actual tunnel entrances. It does not necessitate expensive imported equipment, as general CCTV cameras can be applied to general roads, and low-cost IR temperature sensors can be used to provide efficiency and high accuracy in road sections such as national roads and highways. It is envisaged that the developed system will be applied to in situ conditions on roads."

In order to build a fully automatic scratch detection model, we propose a one-step unmanned scratch detection deep learning model. The proposed model is implemented by applying transfer learning and fine-tuning to the deep learning model that detects changes in satellite images. In the proposed car sharing service, specular reflection greatly affects the scratch detection performance since the brightness of the gloss-treated automobile surface is anisotropic and a non-expert user takes a picture with a general camera. In order to reduce detection errors caused by specular reflected light, we propose a preprocessing process for removing specular reflection components. For data taken by mobile phone cameras, the proposed system can provide high matching performance subjectively and objectively. The scores for change detection metrics such as precision, recall, F1, and kappa are 67.90%, 74.56%, 71.08%, and 70.18%, respectively."

To classify disasters by type, a learning model generated from NAS was employed, and when compared to other classification such as RF (Random Forest), SVC (Support Vector Classifier) or GBM (Gradient Boost Machine) to check the optimal performance of the model, the suggested model exhibited the best performance with an 0.8928 F1-Score. The model for disaster notification service will provide automated disaster notice and rapid reaction."
Normal data based rotating machine anomaly detection using CNN with self-labeling,2022,"['anomaly detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'pretext task', 'self-labeling']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"To train deep learning algorithms, a sufficient number of data are required. However, in most engineering systems, the acquisition of fault data is difficult or sometimes not feasible, while normal data are secured. The dearth of data is one of the major challenges to developing deep learning models, and fault diagnosis in particular cannot be made in the absence of fault data. With this context, this paper proposes an anomaly detection methodology for rotating machines using only normal data with self-labeling. Since only normal data are used for anomaly detection, a self-labeling method is used to generate a new labeled dataset. The overall procedure includes the following three steps: (1) transformation of normal data to self-labeled data based on a pretext task, (2) training the convolutional neural networks (CNN), and (3) anomaly detection using defined anomaly score based on the softmax output of the trained CNN. The softmax value of the abnormal sample shows different behavior from the normal softmax values. To verify the proposed method, four case studies were conducted, on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, IEEE PHM 2012 data challenge dataset, PHMAP 2021 data challenge dataset, and laboratory bearing testbed; and the results were compared to those of existing machine learning and deep learning methods. The results showed that the proposed algorithm could detect faults in the bearing testbed and compressor with over 99.7% accuracy.In particular, it was possible to detect not only bearing faults but also structural faults such as unbalance and belt looseness with very high accuracy. Compared with the existing GAN, the autoencoder-based anomaly detection algorithm, the proposed method showed high anomaly detection performance."

The process of diagnosing bearing faults using machine learning is as follows. First, the features, including the fault characteristic of the vibration signals, are extracted, and these features are selected to reduce the dimension of the features. These features are input into the machine learning classifier to diagnose the system's health. In addition to machine learning methods, CNN, one of the deep learning methods, is widely used.Since the deep learning model extracts features by itself, only the preprocessing process of converting the bearing signals into 2D is needed. The fault classification accuracy of two vibration signal transformation methods as preprocessing methods for the CNN model was compared. This paper compares the bearing fault classification performance of several machine learning commonly used and the CNN model for the lab-made wind turbine machinery testbed. By comparing different feature extraction, feature selection, and classification methods, the most appropriate pipeline is selected for the testbed. Also, grad-cam, an explainable AI(XAI) technique, is applied to interpret the CNN based classification in terms of interested frequency bandwidth. The XAI analysis was verified by designing preprocessing filters based on the grad-cam outputs for enhancing classification performance."

Most existing methods for hair removal are based on image processing, but their performance tends to be significantly degraded in hairy skin images. As an alternative, an image inpainting approach based on deep learning can be taken into account, while few deep learning models for hair removal have been reported due to the lack of datasets. In this paper, we evaluate the applicability of BAT-Fill which is a transformer-based deep learning model as an image inpainting method for hair removal in skin images. BAT-Fill consists of not only the coarse network based on bidirectional autoregressive transformers but also the refinement network based on generative adversarial network (GAN). While a typical process of image inpainting is to progressively fill the inner hidden block using the properties of neighbor pixels, it is challenging to accurately extract the skin properties of neighbor pixels when hairs are largely distributed. The transformer is a solution for reconstructing the skin texture by learning the similarity of pixel properties between two distant areas, where local skin textures can be accurately predicted using global skin properties. The model assessment shows that BAT-Fill is effective to enhance the perceptual quality of the hair-removed image as it exhibits significant improvement in FID although it does not in PSNR and SSIM."

Adversarial examples are data modified for causing AI models to misclassify the data. Unlike counterfactual examples, perturbations applied to adversarial examples are difficult for humans to perceive. In a simple model, generating adversarial examples is similar to generating counterfactual examples. In contrast, it is different in deep learning because the cognitive difference between humans and deep learning models is often huge.Nevertheless, we confirmed that adversarial examples generated by certain deep learning models were similar to counterfactual examples.

The similarity was measured by comparing the results of PoseNet posture estimation with the actual posture estimation of the character’s joint structure. As a result of the study, the closer the anatomical similarity and body ratio of animation characters approached the reality, the higher the performance of PoseNet and the lower the actual difference value in the analysis of pixel differences between PoseNet images and estimates. Through this, it was confirmed that deep learning models such as PoseNet can be used as an effective analysis tool for analyzing the motion of animation characters.

One of the systems is product identification number recognition. In this study, we handled Bloom Identification Number (BIN) which is common in steel industries. For our BIN recognition algorithm, we adopted deep learning because it outperforms conventional algorithms in many computer vision tasks. Furthermore, applying a trained deep learning model to another factory is a big issue because data from different factories can look alike to us, but the trained models might confuse them because of the difference in background, light condition, and camera position. For this reason, new label annotations are required to train the model once again. However, label annotations will always be a big burden whenever applying a trained model to different factories. In this paper, we introduce a new method of BIN recognition that does not require data labeling of new data when training. This gives us the advantage of eliminating the time of labeling new collected data when applying the deep learning network to other factories."

It is to secure motion intention-response simultaneity for efficient and safe worker-exoskeleton robot interaction. Background: Industrial exoskeleton robots are emerging as a solution to reduce work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The main key for successful development of an active exoskeleton robot is to understand and respond accurately to the wearers motion intention. The control system of a wearable robot needs to recognize in advance the exact moment to start activating its joints. Method: Sequential data for 6 representative motion types (walking, left lunge, right lunge, stoop, squat, Asian squat) of the lower extremity joints were collected using inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based model, which is one of the representative deep learning techniques, was designed to train the data. The accuracy and speed of the model for predicting the motion intention of the subjects were analyzed. Results: The classification model showed 86% of accuracy in average which is satisfactory considering its small size of training data set. Using only the initial data from one motion cycle, it was confirmed that the model can predict which type of motion is in progress 75 to 100ms earlier than follow-up movement of the successive joint. Conclusion: This study confirmed the possibility of using artificial intelligence technique in predicting motion intention of workers based on earlier joint kinematic data. It is expected to develop a more sophisticate prediction model in the further study based on multimodal data sets gathered from various sensors such as EMG and Foot Pressure Sensor. Application: The prediction system for motion intention of workers based on deep learning algorithm could be a solution to secure the simultaneity in human-robot interaction."

효율적인 feature map 추출 네트워크를 이용한 2D 이미지에서의 3D 포인트 클라우드 재구축 기법,2022,"['Point Cloud', 'Feature Map', 'Reconstruction', 'Reparameterization Trick', 'Latent Vector', 'Deep Learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we propose a 3D point cloud reconstruction technique from 2D images using efficient feature map extraction network. The originality of the method proposed in this paper is as follows. First, we use a new feature map extraction network that is about 27% efficient than existing techniques in terms of memory. The proposed network does not reduce the size to the middle of the deep learning network, so important information required for 3D point cloud reconstruction is not lost. We solved the memory increase problem caused by the non-reduced image size by reducing the number of channels and by efficiently configuring the deep learning network to be shallow. Second, by preserving the high-resolution features of the 2D image, the accuracy can be further improved than that of the conventional technique. The feature map extracted from the non-reduced image contains more detailed information than the existing method, which can further improve the reconstruction accuracy of the 3D point cloud. Third, we use a divergence loss that does not require shooting information. The fact that not only the 2D image but also the shooting angle is required for learning, the dataset must contain detailed information and it is a disadvantage that makes it difficult to construct the dataset. In this paper, the accuracy of the reconstruction of the 3D point cloud can be increased by increasing the diversity of information through randomness without additional shooting information. In order to objectively evaluate the performance of the proposed method, using the ShapeNet dataset and using the same method as in the comparative papers, the CD value of the method proposed in this paper is 5.87, the EMD value is 5.81, and the FLOPs value is 2.9G. It was calculated. On the other hand, the lower the CD and EMD values, the better the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D point cloud approaches the original. In addition, the lower the number of FLOPs, the less memory is required for the deep learning network. Therefore, the CD, EMD, and FLOPs performance evaluation results of the proposed method showed about 27% improvement in memory and 6.3% in terms of accuracy compared to the methods in other papers, demonstrating objective performance."

Threshold-based cloud detection techniques show stable performance because they detect using the physical characteristics of clouds, but they have the disadvantage of requiring all channels’ images and long computational time. Cloud detection techniques using deep learning, which have been studied recently, show short computational time and excellent performance even using only four or less channel (RGB, NIR) images. In this paper, we confirm the performance dependence of the deep learning network according to the heterogeneous learning dataset with different resolutions. The DeepLabV3+ network was improved so that channel features of cloud detection were extracted and learned with two published heterogeneous datasets and mixed data respectively. As a result of the experiment, clouds’ Jaccard index was low in a network that learned with different kind of images from test images. However, clouds’ Jaccard index was high in a network learned with mixed data that added some of the same kind of test data. Clouds are not structured in a shape, so reflecting channel features in learning is more effective in cloud detection than spatial features. It is necessary to learn channel features of each satellite sensors for cloud detection. Therefore, cloud detection of heterogeneous sensors with different resolutions is very dependent on the learning dataset."

Abnormal Electrocardiogram Signal Detection Based on the BiLSTM Network,2022,"['Deep Learning', 'Bidirectional long Short-Term Memory Unit', 'Signal Processing', 'Electrocardiogram Signals', 'Anomaly Detection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The health of the human heart is commonly measured using ECG (Electrocardiography) signals. To identify any anomaly in the human heart, the time-sequence of ECG signals is examined manually by a cardiologist or cardiac electrophysiologist. Lightweight anomaly detection on ECG signals in an embedded system is expected to be popular in the near future, because of the increasing number of heart disease symptoms. Some previous research uses deep learning networks such as LSTM and BiLSTM to detect anomaly signals without any handcrafted feature. Unfortunately, lightweight LSTMs show low precision and heavy LSTMs require heavy computing powers and volumes of labeled dataset for symptom classification. This paper proposes an ECG anomaly detection system based on two level BiLSTM for acceptable precision with lightweight networks, which is lightweight and usable at home. Also, this paper presents a new threshold technique which considers statistics of the current ECG pattern. This paper’s proposed model with BiLSTM detects ECG signal anomaly in 0.467 ~ 1.0 F₁ score, compared to 0.426 ~ 0.978 F₁ score of the similar model with LSTM except one highly noisy dataset."

Fast Convergence GRU Model for Sign Language Recognition,2022,"['Deep Learning', 'Gesture Recognition', 'Human Pose Detection', 'OpenPose', 'Sign Language']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recognition of sign language is challenging due to the occlusion of hands, accuracy of hand gestures, and high computational costs. In recent years, deep learning techniques have made significant advances in this field. Although these methods are larger and more complex, they cannot manage long-term sequential data and lack the ability to capture useful information through efficient information processing with faster convergence. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose a word-level sign language recognition (SLR) system that combines a real-time human pose detection library with the minimized version of the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. Each gate unit is optimized by discarding the depthweighted reset gate in GRU cells and considering only current input. Furthermore, we use sigmoid rather than hyperbolic tangent activation in standard GRUs due to performance loss associated with the former in deeper networks.

Data was split forcross validation. Optimal models were fine-tuned with training and validation datasets, thenrun with test datasets for model evaluation metrics. Results confirmed that the applicationof the Temporal Convolution Network on resistograph profiles enables non-thrive tree iden-tification with the probability, represented by the area under the Receiver OperatorCharacteristic curve, equal to 0.823. Temporal Convolution Network for wood density predic-tion showed a slight improvement in accuracy (RMSE¼18.22) compared to the traditionallinear (RMSE¼20.15) and non-linear (RMSE¼20.33) regression methods. We suggest thatthe use of machine learning algorithms can be a promising methodology for the analysis ofsequential data from non-destructive devices."

Active Learning (AL) efficiently addresses the issue of labeled data collection at a low cost by picking the most useful samples from a large number of unlabeled datasets However, current AL techniques largely depend on regular human involvement to annotate the most uncertain/informative samples in the collection. Therefore, a novel AL-based framework is proposed comprised of proxy and active models to reduce the manual labeling costs. In the proxy model, VGG-16 is trained on chunks of labeled data that later act as an annotator decision. On the other hand, in the active model, unlabeled is passed to Inception-V3 using the sampling strategy. The uncorrected predicted samples are then forwarded to the proxy model for annotation and considered those data have a high confidence score. The empirical results verify that our proposed model is the best in terms of annotation and accuracy."

This work proposes a novel framework named PointMS, which handles the semantic segmentation of point cloud scene, to solve the problem of missing local feature information due to the lack of spatial structure information on the training stage. The structure of framework utilizes spatial structure information of point cloud and balances the extraction of global feature and subtle feature when processing point cloud data. Firstly, a multi-scale combination module (SIFT-MS) is used to extract local features of different scales for enhancing the perception of local structure information at each point. Secondly, the process of feature transmission often leads to the loss of information, so a feature supplement module (FSM) is proposed to complete the information lost after feature transformation through the effective combination of global feature and subtle feature. This module integrates the features of different locations to supplement the information lost in feature conversion. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is efficient for semantic segmentation of S3DIS dataset. SIFT-MS module and FSM module can effectively improve the performance of the semantic segmentation model of point cloud."

ThermalWorld data were used as the learning data. Additionally, drones of EO and IR images were added using thermal infrared cameras. The proposed super-resolution technique adapts the loss function and neural network structure to generate a high-resolution IR image. The loss function learns the neural network by utilizing the difference between the actual image and the generated image, thereby generating an image while maintaining the shape of the object on the image. The resolution is further improved by densely connecting the generator neural network structure and removing batch normalization. Finally, the structure of the discriminator is changed, and the stability of learning improved using the spectral norm.

Diagnosing heart disease is a complex medical problem that requires an analysis of a combination of clinical and pathological data.

Quays in shipyards have different lengths, depths, and facilities so that the allowable quays for each ship are limited. In addition, the working efficiency of the quay process depends on the kinds of the quays where the outfitting processes are performed. As a result, it is inevitable for ships to move around the quays to avoid delay in schedule while maximizing the working efficiency. The movements of ships should be minimized because it is a waste of cost and time. In most shipyards, the quay allocation is manually determined by planners using their own implicit rules. However, the optimal plan can’t be obtained by those heuristics which only considers limited problem space. In this study, the scheduling algorithm for the quay allocation problem is developed using a reinforcement learning approach. Based on the Markov decision process model using discrete-event simulation, the scheduling agent is trained by DRQN (Deep Recurrent Q-network) algorithm and tested with 10 scenarios. The proposed algorithm outperforms the reference value set by heuristic in terms of three KPIs-unallocated duration, the number of ship movements, and ship-quay priority ratio."

To this end, most previous studies focus on utilizing GPU or CPU in edge computing environments to support real-time DNN tasks. Meanwhile, although Edge TPU is regarded as a next-generation AI processor for edge computing, there is a lack of studies on real-time guarantee for Edge TPU. Thus, this paper presents a novel real-time DNN framework that can satisfy the timing requirements of multiple DNN inference tasks in edge TPU environments. This framework provides 1) a cache memory allocation technique that considers the deadline of each task and 2) a scheduling technique based on model segmentation to reduce priority inversion phenomena. We evaluated the performance of our framework by using Google Coral dev board, an embedded board equipped with Edge TPU, and several image classification models. The experiment result shows that our framework can provide higher schedulability by 37% than the existing Edge TPU system."

If the 3 experts disagreed, the majority decision was accepted. Abnormality was defined as a condition in which a urologist judges from the UFM results that further evaluation is required and that the patient should visit a urology clinic. To develop the optimal automatic interpretation system, we applied 4 ML algorithms and 2 deep learning (DL) algorithms. ML models were trained with all UFM parameters. DL models were trained to digitally analyze 2-dimensional images of UFM curves.Results: The automatic interpretation algorithm achieved a maximum accuracy of 88.9% in males and 90.8% in females when using 6 parameters: voided volume, maximum flow rate, time to maximal flow rate, average flow rate, flow time, and voiding time. In females, the DL models showed a dramatic improvement in accuracy over the other models, reaching 95.4% accuracy in the convolutional neural network model. The performance of the DL models in clinical discrimination was outstanding in both genders, with an area under the curve of up to 0.957 in males and 0.974 in females.Conclusions: We developed an automatic interpretation algorithm for UFM results by training AI models using 6 key parameters and the shape of the curve; this algorithm agreed closely with the decisions of urology specialists."

To this end, the importance of visitor studies to understand the visitors’ experience is increasing, and the field is gradually developing in the direction of quantitatively evaluating the visitors’ experience using information communication technology (ICT) technology. However, due to the limited resources and time of the museums, the visitor study to collect various and rich data is still difficult to be carried out in the actual museum. In this context, for an effective visitor survey, it is necessary to understand which type of visitor data is effective in predicting the visitors’ preference for each artwork. Therefore, this research proposed a model for predicting the visitors preference by analyzing various types of visitor data collected from an actual museum.Methods The investigation items for the visitor studies were obtained from the previous literature, and three types were set for collecting the visitor data. At the Ungno Lee Museum of Art located in Daejeon, 1,061 cases of visitor data on all depths were collected, and a model to predict the artwork preference of the visitors was developed from the collected data and a deep learning process. The accuracies of predicting preference for all combinations of datasets were calculated. Based on the results, the model with the highest prediction accuracy was derived, and the differences according to the combinations and data types were examined.Results In this study, a total of 1,023 modeling processes were performed to derive the results of all dataset combinations. As a result, the optimal model’s average prediction accuracy was 82.1%, and it was from the combination of six data: gender, visiting time, viewing time to artwork, viewing sequence, and holding power. In addition, even when the prediction accuracy was examined only with the most easily obtainable data, a combination model for the first situation showing an average accuracy of 63.7% was found (feature-set: abstract/representation, size of artwork). Next, the average accuracy was 75.4% in the combination model for second situation (factor set: visiting time, viewing time to artwork, holding power, visit counts). Lastly, the third situation was the same as the optimal model result.Conclusions This research defined the data types for visitor experience in the field of visitor studies and developed a prediction model with deep learning techniques. In addition, it was confirmed how the accuracy of the prediction of visitors’ preferences differs according to the combinations of data types. Also, two methods to utilize our suggested deep neural network (DNN) model in visitor studies and exhibition design were suggested. If the model is advanced by applying the visitor data of enormous artworks in the future, the museums can efficiently conduct visitor studies with our study results. We hope that our research can contribute to designing exhibitions in consideration of the visitors."

Using CT as a reference, two independent radiologists evaluated CXR images for the presence or absence of pulmonary nodules in three reading sessions (standard CXR, BSt-DE CXR, and BSp-DL CXR). Person-wise and nodule-wise performances were assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and alternative free-response ROC (AFROC) curve analyses, respectively. Subgroup analyses based on nodule size, location, and the presence of overlapping bones were performed.Results: BSt-DE with an area under the AFROC curve (AUAFROC) of 0.996 and 0.976 for readers 1 and 2, respectively, and BSp-DL with AUAFROC of 0.981 and 0.958, respectively, showed better nodule-wise performance than standard CXR (AUAFROC of 0.907 and 0.808, respectively; p ≤ 0.005). In the person-wise analysis, BSp-DL with an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.984 and 0.931 for readers 1 and 2, respectively, showed better performance than standard CXR (AUROC of 0.915 and 0.798, respectively; p ≤ 0.011) and comparable performance to BSt-DE (AUROC of 0.988 and 0.974; p ≥ 0.064).

In addition, the numbers of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths, and the variable population were noted to track the correlation with the accuracy of prediction. The accuracy assessment of the presented model was based on root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and graph visualization.

We proposed a more efficient residual scaling dense block (RSDB) and the multi-channel cascade architecture to realize more efficient feature reuse. Also we proposed a hybrid loss function based on L1 error and L∞ error to achieve better L∞ error performance. The experimental results show that the overall performance of the network is effectively improved on cascade architecture and residual scaling. Compared with the residual dense net (RDN), the PSNR / SSIM of the new method is improved by 2.24% / 1.44% respectively, and the L∞ performance is improved by 3.64%. It shows that the cascade connection and residual scaling method can effectively realize feature reuse, improving the residual convergence speed and learning efficiency of our network. The L∞ performance is improved by 11.09% with only a minimal loses of 1.14% / 0.60% on PSNR / SSIM performance after adopting the new loss function. That is to say, the L∞ performance can be improved greatly on the new loss function with a minor loss of PSNR / SSIM performance, which is of great value in L∞ error sensitive tasks."
객체 인식 기술을 활용한 시각장애인 자동 보행 안내,2022,"['Object Recognition', 'Deep Learning', 'the Visually Impaired', 'Obstacle', 'Walking Guidance']","도시가 복잡해짐에 따라 보행도로에는 시각장애인들의 보행을 방해하는 다양한 장애물들이 점차 많아지고 있다.대표적으로 볼라드, 주차차단기, 입간판 등을 예로 들 수 있는데, 이들은 일반적으로 보행에 심각한 방해가 되지 않지만, 시각장애인들에게는 오히려 충돌로 인한 부상의 위험을 발생시킬 수 있다. 이를 해결하기 위해 GPS를 비롯한 다양한장치를 이용한 방법들이 제안되었으나, 장소의 제약, 장애물 감지의 부정확성, 특수한 장치에 대한 요구 등의 문제로인해 대중적으로 사용하기에는 한계를 지니고 있다. 본 논문에서는 최신 스마트폰에 기본적으로 장착된 간단한 장치만을활용하여 보행 중에 출현하는 각종 장애물을 자동인식하고 충돌의 위험을 사전에 알려주는 방법을 제안한다. 제안된 방법은 전방을 촬영한 동영상에서 장애물의 종류뿐만 아니라 거리를 파악하여 보행인에게 실시간으로 안내해줌으로써 장애물과의 충돌을 방지하도록 지원한다. 이를 위해 최신 딥러닝 알고리즘을 이용한 객체 인식 기술을 활용하여 장애물출현 여부와 장애물의 종류를 인식하였다. 또한, 보행자의 보폭을 이용한 이동 거리를 계산하는 방법을 응용하여 장애물과의 거리를 측정하였다. 제안된 방법은 기존의 시각장애인을 위한 보행 안내 기술과 비교하여 실내외 장소에 구애받지않으면서 간단한 장치만으로도 정확한 보행 안내가 가능하다는 장점을 갖는다.","As city environments have recently become crowded, there are many obstacles that interfere with the walking of the visually impaired on pedestrian roads. Typical examples include ballads, parking breakers and standing signs, which usually do not get in the way, but blind people may be injured by collisions. To solve such a problem, many solutions have been proposed, but they are limited in applied in practical environments due to the several restrictions such as outside use only, inaccurate obstacle sensing and requirement of special devices. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect obstacles while walking on the pedestrian roads and warn the collision risk in advance by using only sensors embedded in typical mobile phones. The proposed method supports the walking of the visually impaired by notifying the type of obstacles appearing in front of them as well as the distance remaining from the obstacles. To accomplish this goal, we utilized an object recognition technology applying the latest deep learning algorithms in order to identify the obstacles appeared in real-time videos. In addition, we also calculate the distance to the obstacles using the number of steps and the pedestrian's stride. Compared to the existing walking support technologies for the visually impaired, our proposed method ensures efficient and safe walking with only simple devices regardless of the places."

Dataset from motor sensors are collected and forecasting models are trained using four deep learning models, namely, multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), LSTM autoencoder, and bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM). Models are evaluated by measuring the deviation of forecasting values from the real values. Two measures, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), are used to assess model’s performance. Experiments are conducted and found that the Bi-LSTM yielded the lowest RMSE and MAE numbers, hence, the best model to be selected. Further development has been implemented by integrating Bi-LSTM and genetic algorithm (GA) in order to optimize the model performance. Instead of searching the huge hyperparameter space of the neural network, the integrate GA-LSTM model using RMSE as a fitness function to reduce the search space and obtain the optimal or near optimal hyperparameters. The empirically best model is found which yields a lower RMSE value of 0.041 comparing to 0.18 when not optimized."
Smartphone based Indoor Localization Technology using 1D CNN -BLSTM,2022,"['Indoor Localization', 'Deep Learning', 'CNN', 'BLSTM']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The study of indoor localization technology using smart phone has been continuously studied. Fingerprinting is a representative indoor positioning technology. This technology estimates the location by comparing Radio Signal Strength (RSS) information received in one-shot at a specific location with the previously constructed Radio Map. Since the RSS received in one-shot is used, the ability to discriminate signals according to space is low. To solve this problem, the use of RSS spatial patterns based on Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) improves signal discrimination according to space and increases accuracy. However, since PDR is used, there is a problem that it is difficult to use a spatial pattern if PDR distortion occurs due to a heading drift error and a change motion. We propose an indoor positioning technology using 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM). We estimated the position by learning the 1D RSS pattern. In order to generate a large amount of data, we used the pre-built Radio Map. We use a model that combines 1D CNN and BLSTM. 1D CNN is used to extract RSS patterns, and BLSTM is used to learn the relationship of sequential data in both directions. Through this, it is possible to estimate the position using only the RSS. To verify the proposed technology, we compared it with the previous technology. As a result, the previous technology showed 2.19m error and the proposed technology showed 4.663m error. However, the calculation speed is 30 times faster than the proposed technology. It was confirmed that indoor positioning technology using deep learning technology can provide position information with only 1D RSS pattern."

Accordingly, some schemes based on the distributed architecture in peer-to-peer network for location privacy protection are proposed. Most of them assume that mobile terminals are mutually trusted, but this does not conform to realistic scenes, and they cannot make requirements for the level of location privacy protection. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheme for location attribute-based security authentication and private sharing data group, so that they trust each other in peer-to-peer network and the trusted but curious mobile terminal cannot access the initiator's query request. A new identifier is designed to allow mobile terminals to customize the protection strength. In addition, the caching mechanism is introduced considering the cache capacity, and a cache replacement policy based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to reduce communications with location-based service server for achieving location privacy protection. Experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme."

However, most approaches focus on detecting lanes by performing conventional image processing on a single frame. Often, the lack of distinguishing features and the presence of extreme weather conditions such as dense rain or snow makes these algorithms lose their accuracy. In this work, deep learning is merged as a tool to address these issues. A modified version of the LaneNet algorithm was designed as a road lane detector, in which the front image was passed as input to the encoder model. Consequently, the road lanes could be robustly detected even if they were discrete or unclear. For lane curvature estimation, a Kalman filter was utilized, which took the results obtained from the LaneNet detection module as input. The detection results were compared with those obtained using the conventional Hough transformation. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Knowledge-guided artificial intelligence technologies for decoding complex multiomics interactions in cells,2022,"['Computational biology', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Molecular biology']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Cells survive and proliferate through complex interactions among diverse molecules across multiomics layers. Conventional experimental approaches for identifying these interactions have built a firm foundation for molecular biology, but their scalability is gradually becoming inadequate compared to the rapid accumulation of multiomics data measured by high-throughput technologies. Therefore, the need for data-driven computational modeling of interactions within cells has been highlighted in recent years. The complexity of multiomics interactions is primarily due to their nonlinearity. That is, their accurate modeling requires intricate conditional dependencies, synergies, or antagonisms between considered genes or proteins, which retard experimental validations. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including deep learning models, are optimal choices for handling complex nonlinear relationships between features that are scalable and produce large amounts of data. Thus, they have great potential for modeling multiomics interactions. Although there exist many AI-driven models for computational biology applications, relatively few explicitly incorporate the prior knowledge within model architectures or training procedures. Such guidance of models by domain knowledge will greatly reduce the amount of data needed to train models and constrain their vast expressive powers to focus on the biologically relevant space. Therefore, it can enhance a model’s interpretability, reduce spurious interactions, and prove its validity and utility. Thus, to facilitate further development of knowledge-guided AI technologies for the modeling of multiomics interactions, here we review representative bioinformatics applications of deep learning models for multiomics interactions developed to date by categorizing them by guidance mode."

Previous methods included maintaining a centralized blacklist that is manually updated, but newly created pseudonyms cannot be detected. Several recent studies utilized supervised machine learning (SML) algorithms and schemes to manipulate the PWs detection problem. URL extraction-based algorithms and schemes. These studies demonstrate that some classification algorithms are more effective on different data sets. However, for the phishing site detection problem, no widely known classifier has been developed. This study is aimed at identifying the features and schemes of SML that work best in the face of PWs across all publicly available phishing data sets. The Scikit Learn library has eight widely used classification algorithms configured for assessment on the public phishing datasets. Eight was tested. Later, classification algorithms were used to measure accuracy on three different datasets for statistically significant differences, along with the Welch t-test. Assemblies and neural networks outclass classical algorithms in this study. On three publicly accessible phishing datasets, eight traditional SML algorithms were evaluated, and the results were calculated in terms of classification accuracy and classifier ranking as shown in tables 4 and 8. Eventually, on severely unbalanced datasets, classifiers that obtained higher than 99.0 percent classification accuracy.

This is expected to increase medical costs and be the source of various chronic diseases. According to the World Health Organization, stroke ranks second in the world's death toll and the number continues to rise. Researchers from each country have reported various risk factors through various studies and clinical trials, and are aware of the seriousness of stroke. Previous studies have detected symptoms of stroke and investigated causality. Also, with the development of artificial intelligence, it was successful to measure the distortion of the face, which is one of the symptoms from stroke patients. However, stroke can show other symptoms, such as voice tremors, in addition to facial paralysis.

By utilizing sequential data as input, our proposed method aims to generate Spatio-temporal information and overcome the inherent limitations of point cloud data, such as sparsity and irregular acquisition due to distance and occlusion. The proposed method, called ST-FF, performs Spatio-temporal feature fusion between a birds eye view (BEV) feature maps obtained from each LiDAR point set. ST-FF first captures the movement of objects and changes in the surrounding environment over time. Based on the captured motion information, information suitable for the current feature map is selectively extracted from the past feature map. Then the final feature map is obtained by aggregating the feature map at the target frame and the extracted feature maps from the past frame. Finally, the detection head generates 3D bounding boxes for the target frame using the final feature map. Experiments were conducted on the nuScenes dataset to validate the contributions of the proposed method. Higher performance was obtained in LiDAR-based video object detection with ST-FF than 3D object detectors based on a single point set. In addition, by applying the proposed method to the 3D object detectors based on a single point set, we demonstrate that our methods are applicable to the existing LiDAR-based detectors."

Prediction Model of Real Estate ROI with the LSTM Model based on AI and Bigdata,2022,"['Real Estate', 'AI', 'Bigdata', 'Prediction', 'LSTM', 'Machine learning', 'Deep learning', 'Time series forecasting']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Across the world, 'housing' comprises a significant portion of wealth and assets. For this reason, fluctuations in real estate prices are highly sensitive issues to individual households. In Korea, housing prices have steadily increased over the years, and thus many Koreans view the real estate market as an effective channel for their investments. However, if one purchases a real estate property for the purpose of investing, then there are several risks involved when prices begin to fluctuate. The purpose of this study is to design a real estate price 'return rate' prediction model to help mitigate the risks involved with real estate investments and promote reasonable real estate purchases. Various approaches are explored to develop a model capable of predicting real estate prices based on an understanding of the immovability of the real estate market. This study employs the LSTM method, which is based on artificial intelligence and deep learning, to predict real estate prices and validate the model. LSTM networks are based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) but add cell states (which act as a type of conveyer belt) to the hidden states. LSTM networks are able to obtain cell states and hidden states in a recursive manner. Data on the actual trading prices of apartments in autonomous districts between January 2006 and December 2019 are collected from the Actual Trading Price Disclosure System of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT). Additionally, basic data on apartments and commercial buildings are collected from the Public Data Portal and Seoul Metropolitan Government's data portal. The collected actual trading price data are scaled to monthly average trading amounts, and each data entry is pre-processed according to address to produce 168 data entries. An LSTM model for return rate prediction is prepared based on a time series dataset where the training period is set as April 2015~August 2017 (29 months), the validation period is set as September 2017~September 2018 (13 months), and the test period is set as December 2018~December 2019 (13 months). The results of the return rate prediction study are as follows. First, the model achieved a prediction similarity level of almost 76%. After collecting time series data and preparing the final prediction model, it was confirmed that 76% of models could be achieved. All in all, the results demonstrate the reliability of the LSTM-based model for return rate prediction."

Root resorption is not painful in its early stages. As a result, many people who are potentially affected and the condition are often left untreated until it is detected during regular check-ups. If detected early, good treatment results can be achieved, whereas failure to treat the condition properly can lead to tooth extraction. However, the root resorption is currently difficult to detect on panoramic radiographs and may be treated as caries after it becomes painful. The aim of this paper is to identify root resorption from panoramic X-ray images using a deep metric learning algorithm. As a loss function for distance learning, it is known that the loss function in angle space is consistent. Therefore, a loss function is defined and trained using the cosine value of the angle between the feature and the center position to improve the discrimination performance. We obtained experimental results based on 150 image sets with 0.80 of accuracy, 0.62 of TPR, 0.19 of FPR and 0.78 of AUC, respectively."

Since tool breakage adversely affects productivity, real-time tool breakage detection is required. In this study, a tool breakage monitoring system using AE signals and a deep learning model was investigated. First, LSTM-Autoencoder was constructed and trained using the AE signal, cutting speed, spindle speed, and depth of cut as input data. In order to distinguish between tool normality and anomalies, the largest value among the normal cutting data set was determined as the threshold to determine if the tool was broken. As the result of the experiment, we obtained the accuracy of 82.1% during normal cutting, but the accuracy was significantly reduced to 63.1% and 63.6% at the time of entry/exit. This is because the AE value that occurs during normal entry/exit is so large that it is mistaken for breakage. To overcome this problem, a combined model that uses both LSTMAutoencoder and Gaussian Mixture Model was developed. First LSTM-Autoencoder was used to determine the breakage, and then Gaussian Mixture Model was used to determine the authenticity of the breakage. As a result of the experiment using the developed model, 52 out of 57 cuttings including entry/exit cutting were detected as failures, showing a high reliability of 91.2%, proving the superiority of the combined model."

Text Classification Using Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recently, with the development of deep learning technology, a variety of huge models with excellent performance have been devised by pre-training massive amounts of text data. However, in order for such a model to be applied to real-life services, the inference speed must be fast and the amount of computation must be low, so the technology for model compression is attracting attention. Knowledge distillation, a representative model compression, is attracting attention as it can be used in a variety of ways as a method of transferring the knowledge already learned by the teacher model to a relatively small-sized student model. However, knowledge distillation has a limitation in that it is difficult to solve problems with low similarity to previously learned data because only knowledge necessary for solving a given problem is learned in a teacher model and knowledge distillation to a student model is performed from the same point of view. Therefore, we propose a heterogeneous knowledge distillation method in which the teacher model learns a higher-level concept rather than the knowledge required for the task that the student model needs to solve, and the teacher model distills this knowledge to the student model. In addition, through classification experiments on about 18,000 documents, we confirmed that the heterogeneous knowledge distillation method showed superior performance in all aspects of learning efficiency and accuracy compared to the traditional knowledge distillation."

The potential damage to cables should be identified early to prevent disasters. In this study, an efficient deep learning model is proposed for the damage identification of cables using both a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a graph neural network (GNN). Datasets are first generated using the practical advanced analysis program (PAAP), which is a robust program for modeling and analyzing bridge structures with low computational costs. The model based on the MLP and GNN can capture complex nonlinear correlations between the vibration characteristics in the input data and the cable system damage in the output data. Multiple hidden layers with an activation function are used in the MLP to expand the original input vector of the limited measurement data to obtain a complete output data vector that preserves sufficient information for constructing the graph in the GNN. Using the gated recurrent unit and set2set model, the GNN maps the formed graph feature to the output cable damage through several updating times and provides the damage results to both the classification and regression outputs. The model is fine-tuned with the original input data using Adam optimization for the final objective function. A case study of an actual cable-stayed bridge was considered to evaluate the model performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed model provides high accuracy (over 90%) in classification and satisfactory correlation coefficients (over 0.98) in regression and is a robust approach to obtain effective identification results with a limited quantity of input data."

SNNs are biologically inspired, event-driven neural networks that compute and transfer information using discrete spikes, which require fewer operations and less complex hardware resources. Thus, they are more energy-efficient compared to other artificial neural networks algorithms."

Prediction Model of Real Estate ROI with the LSTM Model based on AI and Bigdat,2022,"['Real Estate', 'AI', 'Bigdata', 'Prediction', 'LSTM', 'Machine learning', 'Deep learning', 'Time series forecasting']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Across the world, ‘housing’ comprises a significant portion of wealth and assets. For this reason, fluctuations in real estate prices are highly sensitive issues to individual households. In Korea, housing prices have steadily increased over the years, and thus many Koreans view the real estate market as an effective channel for their investments. However, if one purchases a real estate property for the purpose of investing, then there are several risks involved when prices begin to fluctuate. The purpose of this study is to design a real estate price ‘return rate’ prediction model to help mitigate the risks involved with real estate investments and promote reasonable real estate purchases. Various approaches are explored to develop a model capable of predicting real estate prices based on an understanding of the immovability of the real estate market. This study employs the LSTM method, which is based on artificial intelligence and deep learning, to predict real estate prices and validate the model. LSTM networks are based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) but add cell states (which act as a type of conveyer belt) to the hidden states. LSTM networks are able to obtain cell states and hidden states in a recursive manner. Data on the actual trading prices of apartments in autonomous districts between January 2006 and December 2019 are collected from the Actual Trading Price Disclosure System of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT). Additionally, basic data on apartments and commercial buildings are collected from the Public Data Portal and Seoul Metropolitan Government’s data portal. The collected actual trading price data are scaled to monthly average trading amounts, and each data entry is pre-processed according to address to produce 168 data entries. An LSTM model for return rate prediction is prepared based on a time series dataset where the training period is set as April 2015~August 2017 (29 months), the validation period is set as September 2017~September 2018 (13 months), and the test period is set as December 2018~December 2019 (13 months). The results of the return rate prediction study are as follows. First, the model achieved a prediction similarity level of almost 76%. After collecting time series data and preparing the final prediction model, it was confirmed that 76% of models could be achieved.All in all, the results demonstrate the reliability of the LSTM-based model for return rate prediction."

As an important research direction of intelligent video surveillance technology, video anomaly recognition focuses on how to extract video features and process them and detect anomalies. The features used in traditional video anomaly detection algorithms are mainly motion features based on manual design. However, the characteristics of artificial design need some prior knowledge, which mainly depends on the monitoring target and is difficult to define in different applications. Based on the feature that convolutional neural network can automatically learn the features related to tasks during training, this paper proposes a video anomaly detection algorithm. In video prediction network, a self-coding structure is proposed to realize video feature extraction, timing modeling, and prediction frame generation. The 3DCNN and LSTM are combined to enhance the network's ability to model video actions, and the feature images are fused by stitching to reduce the information loss in the process of feature extraction. After that, a multi-task video prediction model is designed based on the action features extracted from the non-deep learning model. With the help of MOG2 to extract the foreground image and Farneback to extract the optical flow image, the network can predict the video frame and the action features of the video frame at the same time. In addition, according to the action features extracted from the deep learning model, another multi-task video prediction model is designed. With the help of Flownet2-SD, the optical flow graph is extracted , and the video prediction network is optimized by minimizing this difference. The effects of different auxiliary tasks on video prediction ability and video anomaly detection ability of different data sets are discussed."

Recently, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning technique using FFT as a preprocessing process has been proposed to improve the performance of received signal classification in signal interference or noise environments. However, due to the characteristics of the FFT in which the window is fixed, it is not possible to accurately classify the change over time of the detection signal. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a CNN model that has high resolution in the time domain and frequency domain and uses wavelet transform as a preprocessing process that can express various types of signals simultaneously in time and frequency domains. It has been demonstrated that the proposed wavelet transform method through simulation shows superior performance regardless of the SNR change in terms of accuracy and learning speed compared to the FFT transform method, and shows a greater difference, especially when the SNR is low."

The recursive method uses the short-term prediction result as an input value for predicting the next time point data, which can repeatedly be used for making long-term predictions. Time-series cross-validation enables more stable prediction accuracy by enhancing learning that may be lacking in small time series data. By applying these deep learning techniques, this study predicts the monthly rebar price for up to 5 months and compares it with the previous study. As a result, it has been found that the average accuracy increases, and the deviation of the predicted values decreases."

Statistics show that buildings in particular utilize a significant amount of energy, worldwide. Because of this, building energy prediction is crucial to best optimize utilities' energy plans and also create a predictive model for consumers. To improve energy prediction performance, this paper proposes a ResNet-LSTM model that combines residual networks (ResNets) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for energy consumption prediction. ResNets are utilized to extract complex and rich features, while LSTM has the ability to learn temporal correlation; the dense layer is used as a regression to forecast energy consumption. To make our model more robust, we employed Huber loss during the optimization process. Huber loss obtains high efficiency by handling minor errors quadratically. It also takes the absolute error for large errors to increase robustness. This makes our model less sensitive to outlier data. Our proposed system was trained on historical data to forecast energy consumption for different time series. To evaluate our proposed model, we compared our model's performance with several popular machine learning and deep learning methods such as linear regression, neural networks, decision tree, and convolutional neural networks, etc. The results show that our proposed model predicted energy consumption most accurately."

However, in the case of classical music, there still remain some difficulties in applying machine learning techniques.Genre classification or music recommendation systems generated by deep learning algorithms are actively used in general music, but not in classical music. In this paper, we attempted to classify opera among classical music. To this end, an experiment was conducted to determine which criteria are most suitable among, composer, period of composition, and emotional atmosphere, which are the basic features of music. To generate emotional labels, we adopted zero-shot classification with four basic emotions, ‘happiness’, ‘sadness’, ‘anger’, and ‘fear.’ After embedding the opera libretto with the doc2vec processing model, the optimal number of clusters is computed based on the result of the elbow method. Decided four centroids are then adopted in k-means clustering to classify unsupervised libretto datasets. We were able to get optimized clustering based on the result of adjusted rand index scores. With these results, we compared them with notated variables of music. As a result, it was confirmed that the four clusterings calculated by machine after training were most similar to the grouping result by period. Additionally, we were able to verify that the emotional similarity between composer and period did not appear significantly. At the end of the study, by knowing the period is the right criteria, we hope that it makes easier for music listeners to find music that suits their tastes."

One is the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict drag and lift coefficients of airfoil. Another is the Encoder-Decoder (ED) model to predict pressure distribution and velocity vector field. The images of airfoil section are applied as the input data of both models.

The models are established by the convergence performance for the various hyperparameters. The prediction capability of the established CNN model and ED model is evaluated for the various NACA sections by comparing the true results obtained by the CFD, resulting in the high accurate prediction. It is noted that the predicted results near the leading edge, where the velocity has sharp gradient, reveal relatively lower accuracies.

The unique feature of the MIT-ATR is that the measurement images are translated to the simulation-like images by cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). CycleGAN does not need to have a dataset of paired images between the measurement and simulation images. The generated simulation-like images are used as the inputs of the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) network. The VGG network is trained on a simulation database with a softmax layer of multi-classes. Five classes, including a T-72 tank, are considered in the numerical experiments. The images of each class are simulated at all azimuth angles, but the elevation angles range from 6° to 30°.

This study aimed to compare the performanceof three pre-training models that have recently attracted significant attention and to determine which model is more suitablefor PHI recognition. Methods: We compared the PHI recognition performance of deep learning models using the i2b2 2014dataset. We used the three pre-training models—namely, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT),robustly optimized BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa), and XLNet (model built based on Transformer-XL)—to detectPHI. After the dataset was tokenized, it was processed using an inside-outside-beginning tagging scheme and WordPiecetokenizedto place it into these models. Further, the PHI recognition performance was investigated using BERT, RoBERTa,and XLNet. Results: Comparing the PHI recognition performance of the three models, it was confirmed that XLNet had asuperior F1-score of 96.29%. In addition, when checking PHI entity performance evaluation, RoBERTa and XLNet showeda 30% improvement in performance compared to BERT. Conclusions: Among the pre-training models used in this study,XLNet exhibited superior performance because word embedding was well constructed using the two-stream self-attentionmethod. In addition, compared to BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet showed superior performance, indicating that they were moreeffective in grasping the context."

As an educational tool, we are going to use Google Earth, which is composed of an intuitive interface, so that anyone can easily create a digital map. Among the works of Yeolha Ilgi, while realizing that Yeonam wrote while traveling in the Qing dynasty, the works that make us curious about where he wrote them are “Hogokjangron”, “Ilyagudohagi”, and “Sanggi”. In these works, the sense of place is important.The learner draws the path of the entire journey of Yeonam from the viewpoint of the map of Google Earth. Although it is abstract through distance mapping, it is possible to reproduce the geographical distribution and the interrelationship between places in the journey of Yeolha Ilgi, like a kind of graphic essay. Therefore, the spatial context of Yeolha Ilgi is learned by the pattern formed with the correlation of places. Through the graph of this distance mapping, the learner can confirm how the materiality of the places Yeonam passed and its resultant symbolism formed liminality of the spatiality, and how Yeonam shaped it through writing.In the process of visualizing Yeonam’s journey with Google Earth, the learner does not necessarily have to make it into a standardized and normalized map, just like making an existing map. Deep mapping is also possible. Deep mapping is the process of creating a user’s own map by mixing various media such as photos, sketch maps, text, and audio into the map according to the user’s intention. It is possible to create a map of Yeolha Ilgi that reflects the subjectivity and psychology of the learner by using virtual reality from the viewpoint of Google Earth, 360-degree panorama, and image overlay or polygon function. Such a deep mapping provides learners with the opportunity to not only read but also rewrite the map leading to Yeolha while living phenomenologically in the places of Yeolha Ilgi.Through distance mapping, learners can transcendentally reflect on the patterns of the places Yeonam traveled and grasp the context of the journey, more holistically, the envoys of the Joseon Dynasty walked. On the other hand, through deep mapping, learners can experience more vividly the places where Yeonam has traveled, and also reflect on and redefine the places using various media and media devices.Such distance mapping and deep mapping processes can promote the performative effect of learners’ ‘becoming Jiwon Park’. The educational effect can be presented in two ways. First, if the learner’s ‘Becoming Jiwon Park’ is achieved, interesting classes can be conducted by narrowing the distance between modern readers to classic literary works such as Yeolha Ilgi. Second, when accepting cartography as a procedural process rather than a complete one, the learner can become a traveler, the protagonist of another journey, while practicing ‘becoming Ji-won Park,’ the author of Yeolha Ilgi. Becoming a new traveler will cyclically trigger new cartography and writing about a new journey that is different from Yeolha Ilgi."

A break event can be promptly detected and isolated after its occurrence by simultaneously monitoring changes in the sensing readings and by employing an interquartile range-based isolation scheme. By considering the multi-sensor data block of a break to be rank-one, it can be located as the position whose lead field vector is most orthogonal to the noise subspace of that data block using the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm. Owing to the flexibility of deep neural networks in selecting the best regression model for the available data, we can estimate the break size using multiple-sensor recordings of the break regardless of the sensor types. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms was evaluated using the data generated by Maanshan NPP simulator. The experimental results demonstrated that the MUSIC method could distinguish two near breaks. However, if the two breaks were close and of small sizes, the MUSIC method might wrongly locate them. The break sizes estimated by the proposed deep learning model were close to their actual values, but relative errors of more than 8% were seen while estimating small breaks’ sizes."

Therefore, this study attempts to propose a teaching method that can use machine translation effectively in the field of Chinese teaching using an error correction teaching method with machine translation. The types of errors in Chinese translation that frequently appear in Korean learners, are considered, and the results are compared and analyzed by extracting their translation from neural machine translation. In addition, to modify the results output from machine translation and to use them as high-quality translation as a collaboration with advanced science technology and humans, the study attempts to post-edit each other's results, and to analyze the Chinese learning effect using machine translation.As a result of the analysis, humans and machines are able to improve the results of translation and accumulate accurate learning data in the process of correcting each other's errors. The accumulated results will increase the ability of humans to speak a fluent language, and machine translation will consist of accurate function data essential in deep learning systems and will be used as re-learning data to increase translation accuracy."
A cable tension identification technology using percussion sound,2022,"['Artificial Neural Network', 'carbon nanotubes', 'cementitious composites', 'fire', 'mechanical', 'polypropylene fibers', 'cable tension identification', 'deep learning', 'percussion sound', 'structural health monitoring']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The loss of cable tension for civil infrastructure reduces structural bearing capacity and causes harmful deformation of structures. Currently, most of the structural health monitoring (SHM) approaches for cables rely on contact transducers. This paper proposes a cable tension identification technology using percussion sound, which provides a fast determination of steel cable tension without physical contact between cables and sensors. Notably, inspired by the concept of tensioning strings for piano tuning, this proposed technology predicts cable tension value by deep learning assisted classification of ""percussion"" sound from tapping a steel cable. To simulate the non-linear mapping of human ears to sound and to better quantify the minor changes in the high-frequency bands of the sound spectrum generated by percussions, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted as acoustic features to train the deep learning network. A convolutional neural network (CNN) with four convolutional layers and two global pooling layers was employed to identify the cable tension in a certain designed range. Moreover, theoretical and finite element methods (FEM) were conducted to prove the feasibility of the proposed technology. Finally, the identification performance of the proposed technology was experimentally investigated. Overall, results show that the proposed percussion-based technology has great potentials for estimating cable tension for <i>in-situ</i> structural safety assessment."

However, since it is not easy to obtain a return through actual investment, various strategies have been devised and tried in the past to obtain an effective and stable return. Among them, the volatility breakout strategy identifies a strong uptrend that exceeds a certain level on a daily basis as a breakout signal, follows the uptrend, and quickly earns daily returns. It is one of the popular investment strategies that are widely used to realize profits. However, it is difficult to predict stock prices by understanding the price trend pattern of stocks. In this paper, we propose a method of buying and selling stocks by predicting the return in trading based on the volatility breakout strategy using a bi-directional long short-term memory deep neural network that can realize a return in a short period of time. As a result of the experiment assuming actual trading on the test data with the learned model, it can be seen that the results outperform both the return and stability compared to the existing closing price prediction model using the long-short-term memory deep neural network model."

A deep learning algorithm reflecting the time dependence of the measured signal was configured, and the failure pattern was trained using the vibration signal, measured in the equipment's regular operation and failure state. Considering the sequential time-dependence of deterioration implied in the vibration signal, this study adopts Conv1D with sliding window computation for fault detection. The time dependence was also reflected, by transferring the measured signal from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. Additionally, the optimal values of the hyper-parameters of the Conv1D model were determined, using the grid search technique. Finally, the results show that the proposed data preprocessing method as well as the Conv1D model, can reflect the sequential dependency between the fault and its effect on the measured signal, and appropriately perform anomaly as well as failure detection, of the equipment chosen for application."

Efficiently and automatically identifying anomalies from the vast amounts of measured data is significant for assessing the structural conditions and early warning for structural failure in SHM. The major challenges of current automated data anomaly detection methods are the imbalance of dataset categories. In terms of the feature of actual anomalous data, this paper proposes a data anomaly detection method based on data-level and deep learning technique for SHM of civil engineering structures.

Therefore, we became interested in image colorization, which plays an essential role in the field of computer vision. Recently, deep learning techniques for image colorization have progressed remarkably. In this study, colorization is carried out using a novel deep learning model for vivid coloring. The model consists of two components: Pix2Pix as a generative adversarial network (GAN), and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) of a denoiser. The Pix2Pix primarily generates the color image for a given grayscale image as input, and the MLP transforms the colored image into a vivid color image by filtering out noise. In our experiments, the grayscale images used as input images were images of natural objects and artifacts. We observed that the predicted images provided as output images were more neatly colored through the proposed method."

It is a highly practical and commercially important requirement of the agricultural industry. Researchers can create a new data mining method with improved accuracy using current machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches. Seed classification can help with quality making, seed quality controller, and impurity identification. Seeds have traditionally been classified based on characteristics such as colour, shape, and texture. Generally, this is done by experts by visually examining each model, which is a very time-consuming and tedious task. This approach is simple to automate, making seed sorting far more efficient than manually inspecting them. Computer vision technologies based on machine learning (ML), symmetry, and, more specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in related fields, resulting in greater labour efficiency in many cases. To sort a sample of 3000 seeds, KNN, SVM, CNN and CNN-SVM hybrid classification algorithms were used.

Clouds were detected using physical characteristics of clouds in previous research. Cloud detection methods using deep learning techniques such as CNN or the modified U-Net in image segmentation field have been studied recently. Since image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image, precise pixel-based dataset is required for cloud detection. Obtaining accurate training datasets is more important than a network configuration in image segmentation for cloud detection. Existing deep learning techniques used different training datasets. And test datasets were extracted from intra-dataset which were acquired by same sensor and procedure as training dataset. Different datasets make it difficult to determine which network shows a better overall performance.To verify the effectiveness of the cloud detection network such as Cloud-Net, two types of networks were trained using the cloud dataset from KOMPSAT-3 images provided by the AIHUB site and the L8-Cloud dataset from Landsat8 images which was publicly opened by a Cloud-Net author. Test data from intra-dataset of KOMPSAT-3 cloud dataset were used for validating the network. The simulation results show that the network trained with KOMPSAT-3 cloud dataset shows good performance on the network trained with L8-Cloud dataset. Because Landsat8 and KOMPSAT-3 satellite images have different GSDs, making it difficult to achieve good results from cross-sensor validation. The network could be superior for intra-dataset, but it could be inferior for cross-sensor data. It is necessary to study techniques that show good results in cross-senor validation dataset in the future."

With the development of artificial intelligence in recent years, deep learning has been widely used in the agricultural field. As already known, a deep learning model needs a large number of training datasets. However, fire blight does not occur frequently. Thus, the number of their datasets is very insufficient. To increase this insufficient number of datasets, a data augmentation method in relation to fire blight has been previously conducted but it failed to accurately generate images of fire blight symptoms. In this study, CycleGAN was used to generate accurate fire blight leaf images, and an unpaired dataset, which was used previously by default, was converted into a paired dataset, in which leaves were placed in the same direction. As a result, accurate fire blight leaf images were still not generated when an unpaired dataset was used, but when a paired dataset was used, images with accurate fire blight symptoms were generated."

This study presents a deep learning framework that classifies information such as news articles, posts, etc., into S/W/O/T as the first step of a cloud platform that can provide real-time SWOT analysis of companies. This study presents baseline indicators by introducing the BERT model, which is widely used in the natural language processing field, for the first time in SWOT analysis. Starting with this approach, the baseline indicators of this study are expected to be useful for business intelligence cloud platforms that can be easily accessed by all stakeholders through deep learning of SWOT analysis."

GPR은 지반에 전자기파를 송출하며 지반과 다른 매질에 의해 반사되는 신호를 분석하여 지중시설물의 위치와 깊이 등을 파악한다. 그러나 GPR 데이터의 판독은 숙련된 전문가의 주관적 판단에 의존하기 때문에 이를 딥러닝을 통해 자동화하려는 많은 연구가 진행되고 있다. 딥러닝은 학습 데이터가 많을수록 정확한 모델을 만들 수 있으며, 이러한 학습데이터 축적에 있어 수치해석이 좋은 대안이 될 수 있다. 수치해석의 경우 지반의 불균질성을 모사하여 다양한 조건에서의 GPR 탐사 데이터를 생성할 수 있으며, 이를 이용하여 학습모델의 성능을 향상시킬 수 있을 것으로 생각된다. 지반은 불균질하며, GPR 신호는 지반의 다양한 변수로 인해 영향을 받는다. 그러나 이러한 불균질 지반에 대한 연구가 필요한 실정이다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 프랙탈 차원수와 지반의 함수비 범위에 따른 GPR탐사 신호특성을 분석하고 불균질한 지반을 모사하기 위한 입력파라미터에 대한 연구를 수행하였다. 프랙탈 차원수가 2.0을 넘어가면 적합곡선에 대한 오차가 크게 감소하는 것으로나타났다. 그리고 분석의 타당성을 확보하기 위해 함수율의 범위가 0.14 미만이어야 한다.","The importance of subsurface information is becoming crucial in urban area due to increase of underground construction. The position of underground facilities should be identified precisely before excavation work. Geophyiscal exporation method such as ground penetration radar (GPR) can be useful to investigate the subsurface facilities. GPR transmits electromagnetic waves to the ground and analyzes the reflected signals to determine the location and depth of subsurface facilities. Unfortunately, the readability of GPR signal is not favorable. To overcome this deficiency and automate the GPR signal processing, deep learning technique has been introduced recently. The accuracy of deep learning model can be improved with abundant training data. The ground is inherently heteorogeneous and the spacially variable ground properties can affact on the GPR signal. However, the effect of ground heterogeneity on the GPR signal has yet to be fully investigated. In this study, ground heterogeneity is simulated based on the fractal theory and GPR simulation is carried out by using gprMax. It is found that as the fractal dimension increases exceed 2.0, the error of fitting parameter reduces significantly. And the range of water content should be less than 0.14 to secure the validity of analysis."

Although various geophysical methods can be used to detect the buried pipeline, it is not easy to identify the exact information of pipeline due to heterogeneous ground condition. Among various non-destructive geo-exploration methods, ground penetration radar (GPR) can explore the ground subsurface rapidly with relatively low cost compared to other exploration methods. However, the exploration data obtained from GPR requires considerable experiences because interpretation is not intuitive. Recently, researches on automated detection technology for GPR data using deep learning have been conducted. However, the lack of GPR data which is essential for training makes it difficult to build up the reliable detection model. To overcome this problem, we conducted a preliminary study to improve the performance of the detection model using finite difference time domain (FDTD)-based numerical analysis. Firstly, numerical analysis was performed with homogeneous soil media having single permittivity. In case of heterogeneous ground, numerical analysis was performed considering the ground heterogeneity using fractal technique. Secondly, deep learning was carried out using convolutional neural network. Detection Model-A is trained with data set obtained from homogeneous ground. And, detection Model-B is trained with data set obtained from homogeneous ground and heterogeneous ground. As a result, it is found that the detection Model-B which is trained including heterogeneous ground shows better performance than detection Model-A. It indicates the ground heterogeneity should be considered to increase the performance of automated detection model for GPR exploration."

Several studies have focused on tracking and monitoring vessel movements based on automatic identification system (AIS) data; however, ships without AIS have limited monitoring and tracking ability. High-resolution optical satellite images can provide the missing layer of information in AIS-based monitoring systems because they can identify non-AIS vessels and small ships over a wide range. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate vessel monitoring and small vessel classification systems using high-resolution optical satellite images. This study examined the possibility of developing ship monitoring systems using Compact Advanced Satellite 500-1 (CAS500-1) satellite images by first training a deep learning model using satellite image data and then performing detection in other images. To determine the effectiveness of the proposed method, the learning data was acquired from ships in the Yellow Sea and its major ports, and the detection model was established using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm. The ship detection performance was evaluated for a domestic and an international port. The results obtained using the detection model in ships in the anchorage and berth areas were compared with the ship classification information obtained using AIS, and an accuracy of 85.5% and 70% was achieved using domestic and international classification models, respectively. The results indicate that high-resolution satellite images can be used in mooring ships for vessel monitoring.

Today, the concept of trustworthiness is at the heart of AI governance. However, unlike active practical discussions on the sub- components of trustworthiness, fundamental discussions are insufficient. This may make it difficult to systematically understand and critically reflect on the present and future of trustworthy AI governance and may hinder the creation of desirable legal policies.Based on the awareness of these problems, this paper examines the theories of AI trustworthiness and discusses their implications. In human society, the concept of trustworthiness focuses mainly on reducing fundamental uncertainty by exercising reciprocity based on good will. While this may play a significant role in traditional rule-based AI contexts, it is difficult to apply it to deep learning AI, where uncertainty related to results rather than intentions is mainly highlighted. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish a new trustworthiness theory based on the results.The establishment of a risk management system to reduce uncertainty is at the core of this result-based trustworthiness theory. In the case of technical risks, which have been traditionally discussed in the engineering field, various risk management methodologies have already been established. On the other hand, in the case of social risks created by deep learning AI, it is not easy to apply the existing quantitative risk management methodologies because they are related to human qualitative values. In response, two alternatives have been proposed: human-in-the-loop and technological advancement. Instead of acknowledging the supremacy of either one, we should have convergent thinking that embraces both."
Land Use and Land Cover Mapping from Kompsat-5 X-band Co-polarized Data Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Network,2022,"['KOMPSAT-5', 'LULC', 'cGAN', 'ResUNet']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is an important factor in geospatial analysis. Although highly precise ground-based LULC monitoring is possible, it is time consuming and costly. Conversely, because the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor is an all-weather sensor with high resolution, it could replace field-based LULC monitoring systems with low cost and less time requirement. Thus, LULC is one of the major areas in SAR applications. We developed a LULC model using only KOMPSAT-5 single co-polarized data and digital elevation model (DEM) data. Twelve HH-polarized images and 18 VV-polarized images were collected, and two HH-polarized images and four VV-polarized images were selected for the model testing. To train the LULC model, we applied the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) method. We used U-Net combined with the residual unit (ResUNet) model to generate the cGAN method. When analyzing the training history at 1732 epochs, the ResUNet model showed a maximum overall accuracy (OA) of 93.89 and a Kappa coefficient of 0.91. The model exhibited high performance in the test datasets with an OA greater than 90. The model accurately distinguished water body areas and showed lower accuracy in wetlands than in the other LULC types. The effect of the DEM on the accuracy of LULC was analyzed. When assessing the accuracy with respect to the incidence angle, owing to the radar shadow caused by the side-looking system of the SAR sensor, the OAtended to decrease as the incidence angle increased. This study is the first to use only KOMPSAT-5 single co-polarized data and deep learning methods to demonstrate the possibility of high-performance LULC monitoring. This study contributes to Earth surface monitoring and the development of deep learning approaches using the KOMPSAT-5 data."
Development of Scan Simulator for Automation of Nuclear Facility 3D Modeling,2022,"['Robotic Decommissioning', 'Scan', 'Point Cloud', 'Simulator']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"During the decommissioning of nuclear facilities, 3D digital model that precisely describes the work environment can expedite the accomplishment of the work. Thus, the workers’ exposure to radiation is minimized and the safety risk to the workers is reduced, while precluding inadvertent effects on the environment. However, it is common that the 3D model does not exist for legacy nuclear facilities as most of the initial design drawings are 2D drawings and even some of the 2D drawings are missing. Even in the case that all of the 2D drawings are intact, these initial design drawings need to be updated using asbuilt data because facilities get modified through years of operation. In those cases, 3D scanning can be a good option to quickly and accurately generate a structure’s actual 3D geometric information. 3D scanning is a technique used to capture the shape of an object in the form of point cloud. Point cloud is a collection of large number of points on the external surfaces of objects measured by 3D scanners. The conversion of point cloud to 3D digital model is a labor-intensive process as a human worker needs to recognize objects in the point cloud and convert the objects into 3D model, even though some of the conversion process can be automated by using commercial software packages. With the aim of full automation of scan-to-3D-model process, deep learning techniques that take point cloud as input and generate corresponding 3D model have been studies recently. This paper introduces an efficient scan simulation method. The simulator generates synthetic point cloud data used to train deep learning models for classifying reactor parts in robotic nuclear decommissioning system. The simulator is built by implementing a ray-casting mechanism using a python library called ‘Pycaster’. In order to improve the speed of simulation, multiprocessing is applied. This paper describes the ray casting simulation mechanism and compares the in-house scan simulator with an open source sensor simulation package called Blensor."

The proposed GCN-based method dynamically fuses feature map information of all layers according to learnable adjacency matrix weights. The adjacency matrix weight is generated based on the multi-scale attention mechanism to adaptively reflect the scale information of the object. The feature map fusion process is performed through a matrix multiplication operation between adjacency matrix and a feature node matrix. The performance of the proposed method was verified by showing that it improves the multi-scale object detection performance in the PASCAL-VOC benchmark dataset compared to the existing FPN method."

GRU 기반 행동 분석 모델을 이용한 어린이 이상 행동 검출 시스템,2022,"['Deep Learning', 'GRU', 'Child Abuse', 'CCTV', 'Real-time', 'MoblieNetV3']","최근 어린이집 아동학대가 빈번히 발생하고 있다. 이를 방지하기 위해 CCTV 설치를 의무화하였지만, CCTV 영상 열람에 대한 문제점이 제기되었다. 본 연구에서는 GRU를 이용한 어린이 이상 행동 검출 시스템을 제안한다. 이상 행동을 검출하기 위한 모델은 AIHub에서 제공하는 데이터셋을 이용하여 학습을 진행한다. 본 모델은 MoblieNetV3을 통해 추출한 특징 벡터를 GRU에 입력하여 일반, 폭력으로 분류한다. 또한, 분류된 이상 행동 구간을 따로 저장함으로써 사용성을 높이고자 한다.","Recently, child abuse at kindergarten has frequently occurred. In order to prevent it, CCTV installation was mandatory, but problems with viewing CCTV were raised. In this paper, we propose an abnormal behavior detection system for children using GRU. The model for detecting abnormal behavior is learned using a dataset provided by AIHub. This model inputs feature vectors extracted to MobileNetV3 into GRU and classifies them as general and violent. In addition, it is intended to increase usability by separately storing videos of abnormal behavior."
Switching DNN for Autonomous Driving System,2022,"['Deep neural network', 'Object-detection', 'Autonomous driving', 'Software engineering']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In an autonomous driving system, building a rigorous object detection model unaffected by conditions, such as weather or time-of-day, is essential for safety. However, as deep learning models are often limited in generalizability, training over the entire data collection can be suboptimal, e.g., daytime training instances hinder the training for nighttime prediction. We call this the curse of multitasking (CoM), which was first observed in multilingual training, where training a multilingual model can be suboptimal, compared to multiple monolingual models. Our contribution is observing CoM in autonomous driving, overcoming the problem by building multiple mono-task models, or specialized experts for each task, then switching models according to the input condition, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the detection model. We show the effectiveness of using the proposed strategy in both YOLOv3 and RetinaNet models on BDD dataset."

A simple new sparsity check method for L-infinity Attack,2022,"['Deep Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Computer Vision', 'Sparsity', 'adversarial attack']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"There are various adversarial attacks on neural networks. Many previous studies have reported that neural networks are vulnerable to those adversarial attacks. In the perspective of safety, we have to evaluate a model's robustness against those attacks. However, it is not simple to determine whether a model is robust to adversarial attacks since there exist multiple properties for a model. Mostly, we have measured robustness with accuracy against those attacks so far. In a recent study, it was shown that this measurement methodology is not sufficient to capture all the robustness properties. In this paper, we present a simple new metric that captures sparsity, a robustness property against L-infinity sparse attacks. Through several experiments we show that there is necessity to use diverse metric to evaluate a model's robustness and our new metric works well."

In addition, BERT-based multilingual and Korean pre-trained language models were selected, compared, and tested. For Korean documents, the Korean pre-trained language models outperformed the multilingual pre-trained language models in ROUGE scores. The cause was analyzed through the extraction ratio of selected summary sentences."

Specifically, the time and cost of re-photographing were reduced by partially occluding a region. To maintain the original image’s pixel value as much as possible and to maintain restored and unrestored area continuity, a simulation restoration technique modified with the Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) method was developed. The accuracy of the simulated image was analyzed by comparing CycleGAN and histogram matching, as well as the pixel value distribution, with the original image. The results show that for Site 1 (out of three sites), the root mean square error and R2 of CycleGAN were 169.36 and 0.9917, respectively, showing lower errors than those for histogram matching (170.43 and 0.9896, respectively). Further, comparison of the mean and standard deviation values of images simulated by CycleGAN and histogram matching with the ground truth pixel values confirmed the CycleGAN methodology as being closer to the ground truth value. Even for the histogram distribution of the simulated images, CycleGAN was closer to the ground truth than histogram matching."

Consequently, detailed information (facial expression, gestures, and etc.) of each movement that is important for sign language translation is not emphasized.

Among them, in this paper, we would like to focus on how to use Virtual Try-On that can be applied to 2D photos. Virtual Try-On is to fit the clothing product image to the human body image, similar to the old sticker doll dress-up game. By using Virtual Try-On, it is possible to synthesize clothing product images without additional graphic manual work on the human body. It can be used in various fields including the fashion industry. In this paper, we would like to discuss the Virtual Try-On method that can be used in the fashion industry. In the past, because a lot of money was invested in professional fashion pictorials and products, it became a big burden for small new fashion brands that lack financial resources to shoot fashion pictorials and products. In order to solve these problems, in this paper, we would like to present a method of using Virtual Try- On in connection with government-supported projects. Virtual Try-On can be implemented in various ways such as CP-VTON, VTON, VTNFP, ClothFlow, ACGPN, etc. In this paper, the test was conducted using the method called VITON-HD. Due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak, winds of change have blown in various industries around the world. To prevent the spread of the epidemic, countries have locked their doors to foreigners, and airports have been closed. These winds of change have brought about great changes to the fashion industry as well. In the past, famous fashion companies have been competing for fashion photo shoots with famous models in many wonderful tourist destinations. However, as it became impossible for models to travel domestically and abroad, including overseas travel, the fashion industry had to find new alternatives. In the midst of such changes, virtual influencers such as 'Metaverse Worldview' and 'Rozy' appeared. The reasons why virtual influencers have attracted attention in the fashion and advertising industries are as follows. 1) No restrictions on working hours. 2) Irrespective of the place of work 3) There is no need to fit the model's personal schedule, mood, condition, or other needs, and there is no need to be interrupted. This paper summarizes the Virtual Try-On trend that can increase productivity within the virtual influencer and metaverse, and aims to share the research results on various methods that can be effectively and inexpensively used by many in the fashion industry. Fashion item image data accumulated on the public data platform can be utilized in various fields that use graphic technology, such as the game industry and the advertising industry, in addition to the fashion industry.

This paper deals with the problem of resolution limitation due to GPU memory in performing such neural style transfer. We can expect that the gradient operation for style transfer based on partial image, with the aid of the fixed size of receptive field, can produce the same result as the gradient operation using the entire image. Based on this idea, each component of the style transfer loss function is analyzed in this paper to obtain the necessary conditions for partitioning and padding, and to identify, among the information required for gradient calculation, the one that depends on the entire input. By structuring such information for using it as auxiliary constant input for partition-based gradient calculation, this paper develops a recursive algorithm for super high-resolution image style transfer. Since the proposed method performs style transfer by partitioning input image into the size that a GPU can handle, it can perform style transfer without the limit of the input image resolution accompanied by the GPU memory size. With the aid of such super high-resolution support, the proposed method can provide a unique style characteristics of detailed area which can only be appreciated in super high-resolution style transfer."

For training, 277 pairs of PD- and T2-WI sagittal TMJ images were used. Transfer learning of the pix2pix GAN model was utilized to generate T2-WI from PD-WI. Model performance was evaluated with the structural similarity index map (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) indices for 31 predicted T2-WI (pT2).The disc position was clinically diagnosed as anterior disc displacement with or without reduction, and joint effusion as present or absent. The true T2-WI-based diagnosis was regarded as the gold standard, to which pT2-based diagnoses were compared using Cohen’s ĸ coefficient.Results: The mean SSIM and PSNR values were 0.4781(±0.0522) and 21.30(±1.51) dB, respectively. The pT2 protocol showed almost perfect agreement (ĸ = 0.81) with the gold standard for disc position. The number of discordant cases was higher for normal disc position (17%) than for anterior displacement with reduction (2%) or without reduction (10%). The effusion diagnosis also showed almost perfect agreement (ĸ = 0.88), with higher concordance for the presence (85%) than for the absence (77%) of effusion.Conclusion: The application of pT2 images for a TMJ MRI protocol useful for diagnosis, although the image quality of pT2 was not fully satisfactory. Further research is expected to enhance pT2 quality."

The singular value decomposition (SVD) entropy based efficient metric for diversity is proposed In the proposed approach, filters are clustered by groups and they are calculated as differences from the center values within the groups, rather than by entire rank based comparison. This provides an effective method for increasing the substantial diversity of filters. Furthermore, the filters with low diversity are adjusted by the diversity spreading framework for better diversity in the reconstruction process. The improvement of the filter representation by performing experiments on CIFAR 10/100 data for VGG16, and ImageNet for ResNet34 is provided. Because there are no similar studies, we compare our results with respect to those of relatively relevant pruning methods in terms of classification performance accuracy as well as the pruned rates and flops."

Some recent State of the art works which adopt transformer and/or pose-guided methods improve the feature representation and performances, but there is a room to enhance them in both representation and heavy structure. In this paper, we suggest to efficiently improve the transformer-based Re-ID method for the occluded person as follows. First, in data augmentation to improve Re-identification performance, instead of deleting an arbitrary area, only the part containing the keypoint feature of a person is deleted for effective learning in occlusion. Second, a consistency loss between global and local features of a body part is proposed for improving the discrimination to recognize the identical person.We compare the mAP and Rank-1 performances of our approach and various existing methods on the Occluded-Duke dataset.Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the competitive methods."

While language models (LMs) have successfully been used to examine and verify linguistic representations, most studies have focused on the general phenomenon of subject-verb agreement. As such, this study focused on the particular construction known as it-cleft, in order to consolidate the LM’s role as a linguistic platform. In the experiment using BERT, the surprisal of each case (i.e., nominative and accusative) is compared. The investigation successfully replicated the findings of previous studies, specifically by capturing the use of the accusative form, inhibition of the first-person pronominal, and collocate feature of the first-person pronominal with the complementizer who.The results from the LM also deliver further contribution to the study of it-cleft, involving the between number and the relationship between the pronominal and syntactic role. Thus, the usage of BERT both revealed new research questions while verifying evidence from previous studies on the it-cleft pronominal. This demonstrates that BERT can correctly represent particular constructions and broadens the possibilities of LMs as a linguistic platform."

Materials and Methods: From January to November 2019, MRI scans for TMJ were reviewed and 308 imaging sets were collected. For training, 277 pairs of PD- and T2-WI sagittal TMJ images were used. Transfer learning of the pix2pix GAN model was utilized to generate T2-WI from PD-WI. Model performance was evaluated with the structural similarity index map (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) indices for 31 predicted T2-WI (pT2). The disc position was clinically diagnosed as anterior disc displacement with or without reduction, and joint effusion as present or absent. The true T2-WI-based diagnosis was regarded as the gold standard, to which pT2-based diagnoses were compared using Cohen's ĸ coefficient. Results: The mean SSIM and PSNR values were 0.4781(±0.0522) and 21.30(±1.51) dB, respectively. The pT2 protocol showed almost perfect agreement(ĸ=0.81) with the gold standard for disc position. The number of discordant cases was higher for normal disc position (17%) than for anterior displacement with reduction (2%) or without reduction (10%). The effusion diagnosis also showed almost perfect agreement(ĸ=0.88), with higher concordance for the presence (85%) than for the absence (77%) of effusion. Conclusion: The application of pT2 images for a TMJ MRI protocol useful for diagnosis, although the image quality of pT2 was not fully satisfactory. Further research is expected to enhance pT2 quality."

However, due to the various characteristics of video motion, such models may not be able to denoise long-term frames. In this paper, we propose a method that takes longer input frames and feeds them to the existing architecture. In particular, the proposed method can effectively extract temporal information from frames that are dependent on each other over a long period of time. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, we implemented our method on the state-of-the-art video denoising model. Through the extensive experiments, the proposed method showed better performance in terms of quality metrics than the existing one, even with a higher noise level, resulting in considerably lower computing times."

In particular, Korean has unique linguistic word and expression features, which might cause mistranslation. For example, in Google Translate from Korean to English, mistranslations occur when a noun in Korean ends with the postposition (josa) in the form of a single consonant. Also, in the English-Korean translations, the honorifics and casual expressions are mixed in the translated results. This is because the alphabetic characteristics and honorifics of the Korean language are not reflected. In this paper, to address these problems, we propose to train a model with sub-words composed of units of letters (jamo) and unifying honorific and casual expressions in the corpus. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed method resolved the problems mentioned above, and had a similar or slightly higher BLEU score compared to the existing method and the corpus."

With the widespread use of student smart cards on campus, especially where students living in campus residence halls, students’ daily activities on campus are recorded with information such as smart card swiping time and location. Therefore, it is feasible to depict the students with the daily activity data and accordingly group students based on objective measuring from their campus behavior with some regular student attributions collected in the management system. However, it is challenge in feature representation due to diverse forms of the student data. To effectively and comprehensively represent students' behaviors for further student group division, we proposed to adopt activity data from student smart cards and student attributes as input data with taking account of activity and attribution relationship types from different perspective. Specially, we propose a novel student group division method based on a multi-view student attribute heterogeneous information network (MSA-HIN). The network nodes in our proposed MSA-HIN represent students with their multi-dimensional attribute information. Meanwhile, the edges are constructed to characterize student different relationships, such as co-major, co-occurrence, and co-borrowing books. Based on the MSA-HIN, embedded representations of students are learned and a deep graph cluster algorithm is applied to divide students into groups. Comparative experiments have been done on a real-life campus dataset collected from a university. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively reveal the variability of student attributes and relationships and accordingly achieves the best clustering results for group division."

To overcome this problem, we introduce a video-captioning module to replace the visual property of video with captions generated by the video-captioning module. To be specific, we adopt the caption generator that converts candidate videos into captions in the inference process, thereby enabling direct comparison between the text given as a query and candidate videos without joint embedding space.

A photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collector is a hybrid system that merges a photovoltaic (PV) module and a thermal collector in one unit to generate electricity and heat simultaneously. In addition to that, it increases efficiency and reduces required costs and space. In this study, three different models of PVT collectors were fabricated based on Tedlar Polyester Tedlar (TPT), Graphite Thermal Sheet (GST), and TPT/GST as a back sheet and tested. An Ethylene Glycol Coolant (EGC) was also utilized with a water tank and a heat exchanger. The ANN model is used to predict PVT collectors’ electrical and thermal efficiencies based on measured weather datasets. Besides, both electrical and thermal models have been tested experimentally. Accurate modeling methods have been applied to generate the output results for training and validation. The actual climatic data and PVT collectors’ outputs of one year with a 5-minute step have been used to calculate the thermal and electrical efficiencies. The solar irradiance, wind speed, humidity, PVT collectors’ outputs, and temperature are the most critical variables to consider as input in the ANN-based model. This study’s expected results are increasing the PVT’s total efficiency by using high thermal conductivity material (GTS) instead of low thermal conductivity material (TPT). The electrical efficiency of the PVT module will increase due to the cooling effect. We also expect congruous results between the ANN analysis and experimental test."

While recent tragedies regarding pedestrian suspension bridges have shown how these bridges can wreak havoc on the society, there are no specific guidelines for construction standards nor safety inspections yet. Therefore, a structural health monitoring system that could help ensure the safety of pedestrian suspension bridges are needed. System identification is one of the popular applications for structural health monitoring method, which estimates the dynamic system. Most of the system identification methods for bridges are currently adapting output-only system identification method, which assumes the dynamic load to be a white noise due to the difficulty of measuring the dynamic load. In the case of pedestrian suspension bridges, the pedestrian load is within specific frequency range, resulting in large errors when using the output-only system identification method. Therefore, this study aims to develop a system identification method for pedestrian suspension bridges considering both input and output of the dynamic system. This study estimates the location and the magnitude of the pedestrian load, as well as the dynamic response of the pedestrian bridges by utilizing artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques. A simulation-based validation test was conducted to verify the performance of the proposed system. The proposed method is expected to improve the accuracy and the efficiency of the current inspection and monitoring systems for pedestrian suspension bridges."

In this study, we propose a method of counting the number of pests captured by digital traps, in order to identify the amount of pests at an early stage. The number of pests captured by digital traps varies widely. In the case of a large number of pests, the pests may stick to each other or be obscured by other pests. This makes pest counting difficult. To solve this problem, a multiscale-based object detection or object counting technique is needed. In the proposed method, we try to propose a new multiscale CenterNet structure by improving the existing single-scale CenterNet object detection model. In addition, we introduce a density estimation network for pest counting by modifying the proposed multiscale CenterNet. Throught the experimental results, it is confirmed that the proposed multiscale CenterNet and multiscale density estimation network are superior to the existing state-of-the-art pest detection and pest counting models."

Recovery of underwater images based on the attention mechanism and SOS mechanism,2022,"['underwater image', 'deep learning', 'gated module', 'dehazing', 'attention mechanism']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Underwater images usually have various problems, such as the color cast of underwater images due to the attenuation of different lights in water, the darkness of image caused by the lack of light underwater, and the haze effect of underwater images because of the scattering of light. To address the above problems, the channel attention mechanism, strengthen-operate-subtract (SOS) boosting mechanism and gated fusion module are introduced in our paper, based on which, an underwater image recovery network is proposed. First, for the color cast problem of underwater images, the channel attention mechanism is incorporated in our model, which can well alleviate the color cast of underwater images. Second, as for the darkness of underwater images, the similarity between the target underwater image after dehazing and color correcting, and the image output by our model is used as the loss function, so as to increase the brightness of the underwater image. Finally, we employ the SOS boosting module to eliminate the haze effect of underwater images. Moreover, experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of our model. The qualitative analysis results show that our method can be applied to effectively recover the underwater images, which outperformed most methods for comparison according to various criteria in the quantitative analysis."

Regarding the epipolar geometry problem, the existing methods cannot have the 1:1 matching of pixel-point during feature map fusion. Therefore, in this paper, we apply a backbone network that utilizes 3D data as itself. We propose a fusion module based on voxel-pixel matching for accurate feature map fusion. For verification, we used the SemanticKITTI dataset, and the performance improved by 2.7 % compared to when a single LiDAR is used."

A huge amount of photographic data has been accumulated through camera trap research for the restoration of endangered species. Until now, analysis of such photo data has only relied on experts, so it took a lot of time to analyze camera trap data. The goral detection system developed in this study, based on goral camera trap data, can enable goral data analysis at a faster than conventional methods. YOLOv4 was used as an object detection algorithm for goral detection. YOLOv4 is a network based on CSPDarknet53 and has improved performance through Bos (Bag of Specials) and BoF (Bag of Freebies). As a result, goral detection was possible with high accuracy and high speed. The performance of the goral detection system can be decreased by luminance at night. In this work, we propose a light invariant goral detection system by appropriately distributing day and night datasets for training YOLOv4. Test results on the night dataset showed an mAP of 0.907 and test results on the day dataset showed an mAP of 0.927.

In this paper, we check how methods popularly used to enhance performance from neural networks respond to datasets similar to real-world data. Also, we experimentally confirm that a training configuration setup that considers the target dataset can be more effective than complex training strategies like knowledge distillation. Although this analysis is somewhat heuristic, we expect it will provide meaningful insights for researchers and developers who want to apply an object detector to actual applications."

In this study, we developed a ResNet-type deep neural network for simulating a heat transfer model in a composite material. To train the neural network, we generated datasets by numerically solving the heat-transfer equations with Kapitza thermal resistance conditions. Because datasets involve various configurations of composite materials, our neural networks are robust to the shapes of material-material interfaces. Our algorithm can predict the thermal behavior in real time once the networks are trained. The performance of the proposed neural networks is documented, where the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are below 2.47E-6, and 7.00E-4, respectively."

To this end, we extend the YOLO (You Only Look Once) network, a variant of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is suitable for 2D still images, not video. Though many researchers have studied on the methods dedicated to recognize objects in video, with a belief that CNN is not enough to recognize motions, we show that it is possible to build a robust but simple medical emergency detection system by extending the YOLO network - a variant of CNN - that only handles 2D images. Also, we report the performance of the proposed system in four performance measures in this paper."

Pipe vibration is a natural phenomenon caused by external motors and fluid flow in the pipe. However, any unfavorable factors, such as in-wall collision by loose parts or unusual fluid flow, can significantly affect the vibration, which results in abnormal vibration patterns when compared to those during regular operation. For this reason, pipe vibration frequency is one of the important parameters to monitor in structural health monitoring. Therefore, a monitoring system that measures the vibration frequency of each pipe area helps to detect these anomalies early. In this study, a multi-kernel neural network was applied to visualize the vibration frequency of pipe areas using a multi-kernel neural network, by analyzing the characteristics of pixel-wise color variations in video data. The results showed that the vibration areas can be visualized using the color that corresponds to the frequency. The proposed model can be utilized for anomaly detection based on pipe vibration monitoring."

This study proves that the recovery of missing information in a GPR image has a direct influence on the performance of subsequent target detection methods. Thus, state-of-the-art matrix completion methods are applied to the GPR image with missing information in both pixel- and column-wise cases with different missing rates, such as 30% and 50%. After the GPR image is successfully recovered, the faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) target detection method is applied. The performance correlation between matrix completion accuracy and the target detection method’s confidence score is analyzed using both quantitative and visual results.

Application of POD reduced-order algorithm on data-driven modeling of rod bundle,2022,"['Proper orthogonal decomposition', 'Machine learning', 'Reduced-order model', 'CFD', 'Fuel rod bundle']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"As a valid numerical method to obtain a high-resolution result of a flow field, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been widely used to study coolant flow and heat transfer characteristics in fuel rod bundles. However, the time-consuming, iterative calculation of Navier-Stokes equations makes CFD unsuitable for the scenarios that require efficient simulation such as sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. To solve this problem, a reduced-order model (ROM) based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and machine learning (ML) is proposed to simulate the flow field efficiently. Firstly, a validated CFD model to output the flow field data set of the rod bundle is established. Secondly, based on the POD method, the modes and corresponding coefficients of the flow field were extracted. Then, an deep feed-forward neural network, due to its efficiency in approximating arbitrary functions and its ability to handle high-dimensional and strong nonlinear problems, is selected to build a model that maps the non-linear relationship between the mode coefficients and the boundary conditions. A trained surrogate model for modes coefficients prediction is obtained after a certain number of training iterations. Finally, the flow field is reconstructed by combining the product of the POD basis and coefficients. Based on the test dataset, an evaluation of the ROM is carried out. The evaluation results show that the proposed POD-ROM accurately describe the flow status of the fluid field in rod bundles with high resolution in only a few milliseconds."

The UK's High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and the Federal Patent Court of Germany (Bundespatentgericht) ruled that the inventor of an invention should be a natural person in terms of respective patent law in force. Meanwhile, the Federal Court of Australia held that artificial intelligence (AI) could also be identified as an inventor under the Patents Act 1990 of Australia. All of these judgments relied on normative, deductive interpretation.However, the patent law is not a fixed norm, as it reflects a strong policy perspective. Therefore, whether AI can be recognized as an inventor cannot be addressed a priori. When it is not studied what specific roles the AI, designated as the inventor of the relevant invention carried out, judgments might be made based on impressions, superficial understandings, and fictional premises, far from the factual ground.ANNs are optimization models that derive desired output from input data through matrix operations, i.e., long sequences of summations and multiplications. Notwithstanding the complexity of “automated” computation, such mathematical calculation should not be equated with an “autonomous” invention of AI. At least under state-of-the-art technology, a machine does nothing but computes an optimal solution based on given data, following the instructions programmed by humans. From the technological point of view, AI can hardly be approved as an inventor yet. There is not much need to do so, even from the normative and policy perspective up to now."

However, early gastric cancer has no special symptoms and is a disease that even experts find difficult to diagnose in gastroscopy. Therefore, in this paper proposed a computer-aided diagnosis(CADx) for early gastric cancer diagnosis using EfficientNetV2-L. Due to the nature of medical data, it is difficult to collect a large amount of data. The data used for training was augmented using Cifar10 policy of the Google's AutoAugment. Additionally, the augmented image was used as an input to the model trained with the original dataset and filtered according to the classification threshold. EfficientNetV2 is a classification network designed Training-NAS that can learn the feature of lesions with a small number of parameters. As a result, EfficientNetV2 set to the threshold value of 0.9 achieved the performance of accuracy 0.943 for early gastric cancer and abnormal image classification.

For three different bird velocities, 9402 input files are created by an automatic data generator considering all possible stacking sequence combinations in accordance with the composite design guidelines. The global deformation of composite laminates caused by bird strike is estimated via the fully connected neural networks established. Results of the present study show that with the use of fully connected neural networks, global deformation of the composite laminate can be estimated reliably and preliminary design of the composite laminate can be performed very fast compared to performing nonlinear finite element analysis involving bird strike.

Various factors affecting the fluorescent emission of liquid scintillators have been reported at the laboratory level. However, long-term performance studies are still ongoing under extreme environmental conditions in large-scale experiments beyond the laboratory level. Given the characteristics of neutrino experiments, the liquid scintillator is sealed inside the detector, making it difficult to observe non-invasive samples. In particular, the long-term physical and chemical stability of liquid scintillators in extreme environments with high radiation bombardment doses, such as nuclear power plants, has not been reported. Accessing a highly radioactive area requires considerable time and effort. In addition, the cost efficiency and reliability of embedded systems have improved with the development of microcontroller weight reduction, integration, and IoT technology. Therefore, researchers hypothesized that long-term liquid scintillators could ensure the operator’s safety and acquire environmental data under extreme conditions. Moreover, experimental know-how can be obtained by using low-gain semiconductor image sensors."

Recently, feature extractor based on transformer has shown excellent advantages for global feature extraction on images. Especially in irregular text images, which can use self-attention to establish the information connection of each part of the image, which can also reduce the influence of the irregular distribution of characters. Therefore, this paper proposes MESTR(Multi-Encoders Scene Text Recognition) that combines a CNN-based[1][2][6] feature extractor and a transformer-based feature extractor. MESTR can extract local and global features of text images at the same time and then integrate global features into local features. During training, we used CTC[6] as guide training in the decoder part, as the compensation training strategy for attentional decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MESTR shows competitive results on all seven benchmarks. At the same time, we provide ablation experiments to show the effectiveness of the improved part on the text recognition model."

Although image inpainting framework integrated with generative adversarial network or attention mechanism enhanced the semantic understanding among facial components, the issues of reconstruction on corrupted regions are still worthy to explore, such as blurred edge structure, excessive smoothness, unreasonable semantic understanding and visual artifacts, etc. To address these issues, we propose a Learnable Structure Knowledge of Fusion Network (LSK-FNet), which learns a prior knowledge by edge generation network for image inpainting. The architecture involves two steps: Firstly, structure information obtained by edge generation network is used as the prior knowledge for face inpainting network. Secondly, both the generated prior knowledge and the incomplete image are fed into the face inpainting network together to get the fusion information. To improve the accuracy of inpainting, both of gated convolution and region normalization are applied in our proposed model. We evaluate our LSK-FNet qualitatively and quantitatively on the CelebA-HQ dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the edge structure and details of facial images can be improved by using LSK-FNet. Our model surpasses the compared models on L1, PSNR and SSIM metrics. When the masked region is less than 20%, L1 loss reduce by more than 4.3%."

The morphology module is composed of min-pooling layers and max-pooling layers, which shows the effect of morphological transformation. The edge-enhanced module is composed of convolution layers, which has the fixed weights of the traditional edge detection algorithm. After comparing the accuracy of various versions of each module for U-Net, we found that the optimal combination is the case that the morphology module of min-pooling and successive layers of min-pooling and max-pooling, and the edge-enhanced module of Scharr filter were the inputs of conv9.

Methods: In total, 1,305 images of the median nerve of 123 normal subjects were used to train and evaluate the model. Four datasets from two measurement regions (wrist and forearm) of the nerve and two US machines were used. The neural network was designed for high accuracy by combining information at multiple scales, as well as for high efficiency to prevent overfitting. The model was designed in two parts (cascaded and factorized convolutions), followed by selfattention over scale and channel features. The precision, recall, dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used as performance metrics. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was also assessed. Results: In the wrist datasets, the proposed network achieved 92.7% and 90.3% precision, 92.4% and 89.8% recall, DSCs of 92.3% and 89.7%, HDs of 5.158 and 4.966, and AUCs of 0.9755 and 0.9399 on two machines.

Backshift refers to the past tense being used in indirect speech, with direct speech being in the present tense. This study argued that language models capture grammatical phenomena that interact with world knowledge and can represent knowledge beyond mere grammatical knowledge. This study used BERT and mBERT models to measure the surprisals of verbs in indirect speech. Surprisal is a measurement that increase in proportion to the difficulty of language processing. Experimental results demonstrated that BERT and mBERT models were sensitive to the backshift phenomenon, revealing that the artificial intelligence language model captured backshift in indirect speech. As backshift requires an understanding of truth, knowledge, and commonsense, these results indicated that the language model understood world knowledge."

The design of tri-wheeled structure and center of mass enable the trolley to move on flat ground and also to ascend stairs by self-balancing. The overall design enables the trolley to avoid collision to walls when the trolley rotates on domestic landings. When the camera recognizes the stair, the sensor measures distance from the trolley to the stair. Then the trolley can move to align itself in the middle of the stair and it starts climbing.

컴퓨터 비전에서 신경망의 가중치 분포,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Over the last decades, deep neural networks have demonstrated significant success in various tasks. To address the special vision task, choosing a hot network as backbone to extract feature is a common way in both research and industry project. However, the choice of backbone usually requires the expert experience and affects the performance of the classification task. In this work, we propose a novel idea to support backbone decisionmaking by exploring the feature attribution and weights distribution of hidden layers from various backbones. We first analyze the visualization of feature maps on different size object and different depth layers to observe learning ability. Then, we compared the variance of weights and feature in last three layers. Based on analysis of the feature and wights, we summarize the traits and commonalities of existing networks."

In this work, we propose an adaptive version of the Slotted-ALOHA (S-ALOHA) protocol, where the transmission probability is constantly adjusted based on estimates of the number of vehicles in the coverage area. These values are computed using deep learning models for time series prediction. One challenge for implementing this approach is that the inputs to the models are noisy since they are also estimates based on the protocol’s operation itself. To address this problem, we propose a new training scheme where we add noise, similar to that produced by the protocol’s operation, to the inputs of the training examples as a form of regularization. Our experiments show that the regularized models perform close to the theoretical optimal where the number of vehicles in the area is always known."

To ensure that the paths generated are plausible and consistent with the intention, we introduce an attentive discriminator and train it with the PGN under a generative adversarial network framework. Furthermore, we devise an interaction model between the positions in the paths and the intentions hidden in the positions and design a novel PGN architecture that reflects the interaction model for improving the accuracy and diversity of the generated paths.

At present, many methods have achieved good results, but most of the existing approaches attempt to improve the performance of scene text recognition from the image level. They have a good effect on reading regular scene texts. However, there are still many obstacles to recognizing text on low-quality images such as curved, occlusion, and blur. This exacerbates the difficulty of feature extraction because the image quality is uneven. In addition, the results of model testing are highly dependent on training data, so there is still room for improvement in scene text recognition methods. In this work, we present a natural scene text recognizer to improve the recognition performance from the feature level, which contains feature representation and feature enhancement. In terms of feature representation, we propose an efficient feature extractor combined with Representative Batch Normalization and ResNet.

However, data augmentation methods are employed for imbalanced training sets to achieve higher accuracy. These samples generated using data augmentation only reflect existing samples within the training set, their feature representations are less diverse and hence, contribute to less precise classification. This paper presents new data augmentation and action representation approaches to grow training sets. The proposed approach is based on two fundamental concepts: virtual video generation for augmentation and representation of the action videos through robust features. Virtual videos are generated from the motion history templates of action videos, which are convolved using a convolutional neural network, to generate deep features. Furthermore, by observing an objective function of the genetic algorithm, the spatiotemporal features of different samples are combined, to generate the representations of the virtual videos and then classified through an extreme learning machine classifier on MuHAVi-Uncut, iXMAS, and IAVID-1 datasets."

From 2015 to 2022, the authors have designed and established the manufacturing of Open Arms as a low-cost, high functionality robotic arms hardware and software framework to serve both humanoid robot applications and the urgent demand for low-cost prosthetics, as part of the Hanson Robotics Sophia Robot platform. Using the techniques of consumer product manufacturing, we set out to define modular, low-cost techniques for approximating the dexterity and sensitivity of human hands. To demonstrate the dexterity and control of our hands, we present a Generative Grasping Residual CNN (GGR-CNN) model that can generate robust antipodal grasps from input images of various objects in real-time speeds (∼22ms). We achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.4% using our model architecture on a standard Cornell Grasping Dataset, which contains a diverse set of household objects."

In order to increase the accuracy in judging the similarity of Hangul fonts, a previous study was conducted to calculate the similarity according to the combination of stroke elements. In this study, we tried to solve this problem by designing an integrated model that reflects the weights for each stroke element. By comparing the results of the user's font similarity calculation conducted in the previous study and the weighted model, it was confirmed that there was no difference in the ranking of the influence of the stroke elements. However, as a result of comparison by letter sizes, it was confirmed that there was a difference in the ranking of the influence of stroke elements.

An interest in the marine energy has been enhanced related to the renewable energy, and among them the design of offshore wind turbines has been attracting attention. The optimized design of airfoils is essential to increase the performance and efficiency of wind turbines. The aerodynamic characteristics of airfoils at a low angle of attack (AoA) can be obtained from airfoil database, but results of that near the stall with large AoA show large deviation. Hence, it is needed to perform repetitive analysis of various shapes near the stall, which results to high cost and time. To overcome this, the artificial intelligence is used and combined with numerical simulations. In this study, three types of airfoils are chosen, which are S809, S822, and SD7062 used in wind turbines.

Typically, in the case of an autonomous driving system, it is crucial to run several DNNs which have high accuracy results and large computation amount at the same time. However, running multiple DNNs simultaneously in an embedded system with relatively low performance increases the time required for the inference. This phenomenon may cause a problem of performing an abnormal function because the operation according to the inference result is not performed in time. To solve this problem, the solution proposed in this paper first reduces the computation by applying the Tucker decomposition to DNN models with big computation amount, and then, make DNN models run in parallel as much as possible in the unit of hidden layer inside the GPU. The experimental result shows that the DNN inference time decreases by up to 75.6% compared to the case before applying the proposed technique."

Most existing few-shot segmentation methods leverage single or multiple prototypes from extracted support features. Although there have been promising results for natural images, these methods are not directly applicable to the aerial image domain. A key factor in few-shot segmentation on aerial images is to effectively exploit information that is robust against extreme changes in background and object scales. In this paper, we propose a Mask-Guided Attention module to extract more comprehensive support features for few-shot segmentation in aerial images. Taking advantage of the support ground-truth masks, the area correlated to the foreground object is highlighted and enables the support encoder to extract comprehensive support features with contextual information.

We modified the first convolutional layer of ResNet50 which has a convolutional kernel of 7 to a superposition of convolutional kernels of 8 and 16 as our feature extraction method. This way allows the model to focus on the overall trend of the ECG signal while also noticing subtle changes. The model further improves the accuracy of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease classification by using a fully connected layer that integrates factors such as gender and age. The ECGResNet model adds Dropout layers to both the residual block and SE module of ResNet50, further avoiding the phenomenon of model overfitting.

This study proposes a modified U-net for tiny crack segmentation in real-world steel-box-girder bridges. The modified U-net adopts the common U-net framework and a novel Self-Attention-Self-Adaption (SASA) neuron as the fundamental computing element. The Self-Attention module applies softmax and gate operations to obtain the attention vector. It enables the neuron to focus on the most significant receptive fields when processing large-scale feature maps. The Self-Adaption module consists of a multiplayer perceptron subnet and achieves deeper feature extraction inside a single neuron. For data augmentation, a grid-based crack random elastic deformation (CRED) algorithm is designed to enrich the diversities and irregular shapes of distributed cracks. Grid-based uniform control nodes are first set on both input images and binary labels, random offsets are then employed on these control nodes, and bilinear interpolation is performed for the rest pixels. The proposed SASA neuron and CRED algorithm are simultaneously deployed to train the modified U-net. 200 raw images with a high resolution of 4928 × 3264 are collected, 160 for training and the rest 40 for the test. 512 × 512 patches are generated from the original images by a sliding window with an overlap of 256 as inputs. Results show that the average IoU between the recognized and ground-truth cracks reaches 0.409, which is 29.8% higher than the regular U-net. A five-fold cross-validation study is performed to verify that the proposed method is robust to different training and test images. Ablation experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SASA neuron and CRED algorithm. Promotions of the average IoU individually utilizing the SASA and CRED module add up to the final promotion of the full model, indicating that the SASA and CRED modules contribute to the different stages of model and data in the training process."

To overcome these limitations, we explored the effectiveness of augmented reality (AR)-guidance to navigate the core-needle insertion in breast biopsy thanks to the enhanced technology of AR. Our proposed framework consists of two independent functions: tumor localization and needle pose tracking in real-time. First, tumor localization was achieved by employing the two-front environmental sensors of HoloLens 2 (HL2) for tracking the passive-reflective markers. Given the geometrical information of the reference markers, the stereo-correspondences and the marker pose can be calculated efficiently for overlaying the corresponding virtual models in HL2. Second, an external RGB camera was used to track the pose of a needle. A You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) model with a customized training set of 200 images was employed to detect the collinear pinkt-ape points attached to the needle. The interpoint-distance between these points will be utilized to estimate the pose of a needle that will be sent to HL2 using TCP/IP communication. Finally, real-time navigation of needle insertion can be rendered in HL2 using a more accurate transformation to assist the breast biopsy. Overall, the preliminary results demonstrate that the whole process can be executed in a reasonable running time of less than two seconds."

Different profiles emerged for the three HEc subject areas. Results strongly suggested that a full representation of ESD was lacking in both curricula with the strongest evidence for interaction followed to a lesser extent by diversity and cooperation. Notions of responsibility, fairness, and finiteness were weak or lacking. Evidence of the presence of the six ESD concepts was namely through inference instead of direct evidence. Future curricular revisions in Korea and Japan should draw on insights from this study to better ensure the deep entrenchment of ESD in middle school HEc education."

Progressive Dehazing and Depth Estimation from a Single Hazy Image,2022,"['Image dehazing', 'Depth estimation', 'Attenuation coefficient', 'Deep learning', 'Entropy']",국문 초록 정보 없음,We propose a progressive dehazing and depth estimation (PDDE) method with optimal estimation of the attenuation coefficient. We investigated the characteristics of dehazing operations related to the depth and attenuation coefficient for PDDE. Entropy was used as a non-reference image quality metric for optimality assessment of dehazed images. The proposed PDDE method provides an optimal dehazed image and depth estimation from a single hazy image. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides clearer and subjectively better results for single image dehazing than previous image dehazing methods. It also results in a significant improvement in the accuracy of depth estimation from a single hazy image compared with previous depth estimation methods.
AI-guided Story Generation Framework with Automatic Storyline Generator,2022,"['Story Generation', 'Storyline Generation', 'Human-guided AI', 'Deep  Learning', 'Natural Language Generation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A story generation task is to develop a system that can continuously generate natural, consistent, and coherent stories for consecutive scenes. Recently transformer-based language models have shown considerable results at the sentence-level generation for learning human-writing ability. However, it is very crucial to understand the way of developing the story using a combination of various contents. Recent works have mainly focused on human-guided AI story generation methods in which humans as guidance determine the next storyline, and the system creates a story that reflects the storyline well. This study focuses on the way of replacing the human role with the AI-based model. Based on this, this study deals with the methodology for creating a long story spanning multiple scenes rather than creating a story at the level of one scene. In this regard, we propose a novel AI-guided story generation framework with automatic storyline generator. It is a pipeline structure consisting of two modules such as a storyline generator and a story generator, which enables the continuous creation of coherent stories. Particularly, we transform the storyline generation problem into a multiple-choice QA problem to predict the next storyline. This study shows the possibility of generating continuous stories for multiple scenes without any human intervention."

This study can contribute to reducing the number of roadkill accidents caused by wild animals appearing on the road of recent vehicles. In addition to the injury or death of wild animals, the accident causes vehicle damage and human casualties.

As such, EMRs have become increasingly used in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). While CDSSs aim to reduce medical errors normally occurring in the process of treating patients by physicians, technical maturity and the completeness of CDSSs do not meet standards for medical use yet. As data further accumulates, CDSS algorithms must be continuously updated to allow CDSSs to perform their core functions. Doing so, however, requires extensive time and manpower investments. In current practice, computational systems already perform a wide variety of functions in medical settings to allow medical staff to focus on other tasks. However, no prior research has evaluated the potential effectiveness of future CDSSs nor analyzed possibilities for their further development. In this article, we evaluate CDSS technology with the consideration that medical staff also understand the core functions of such systems."

While colposcopy is also an essential part of cervical cancer prevention, its accuracy and reproducibility are limited because of subjective evaluation. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that can accurately detect the optimal lesion associated with prognosis using colposcopic images of CIN2 patients by utilizing objective AI diagnosis.Methods: We identified colposcopic findings associated with the prognosis of patients with CIN2. We developed a convolutional neural network that can automatically detect the rate of high-grade lesions in the uterovaginal area in 12 segments. We finally evaluated the detection accuracy of our AI algorithm compared with the scores by multiple gynecologic oncologists. Results: High-grade lesion occupancy in the uterovaginal area detected by senior colposcopists was significantly correlated with the prognosis of patients with CIN2. The detection rate for high-grade lesions in 12 segments of the uterovaginal area by the AI system was 62.1% for recall, and the overall correct response rate was 89.7%. Moreover, the percentage of high-grade lesions detected by the AI system was significantly correlated with the rate detected by multiple gynecologic senior oncologists (r=0.61).Conclusion: Our novel AI algorithm can accurately determine high-grade lesions associated with prognosis on colposcopic images, and these results provide an insight into the additional utility of colposcopy for the management of patients with CIN2."

In general, the multi-view model shows superior pose estimation performance compared to the single-view model. In the case of the single-view model, the improvement of the 3D pose estimation performance requires a large amount of training data. However, it is not easy to obtain annotations for training 3D pose estimation models. To address this problem, we propose a method to generate pseudo ground-truths of multi-view human pose data from a multi-view model and exploit the resultant pseudo ground-truths to train a single-view model. In addition, we propose a multi-view consistency loss function that considers the consistency of poses estimated from multi-view images, showing that the proposed loss helps the effective training of single-view models. Experiments using Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets show that the proposed method is effective for training single-view 3D human pose estimation models."

In this study, nativelikeness of Korean EFL college students’ English writing is assessed using fastText, a neural-network text classifier using subword information. The training data consisted of English sentences from the corpora of native speakers of English and Korean EFL college students. The test sentences consisted of English writing assignments written by Korean EFL college students. fastText performed well for the task of binary classification into native and nonnative sentences, with high accuracy in less than a minute. The sentences that are classified as native with a high probability tend to have fewer grammatical as well as plausibility errors than those classified as nonnative. For the test sentences, correcting grammatical errors (involving articles, number, subject-verb agreement, voice) had weaker effects on the classification of the sentences than correcting plausibility errors (word choices), which conforms to the previous literature. This suggests that fastText is more sensitive to plausibility errors than grammaticality errors which requires knowledge on hierarchical syntactic structures."

Although construction companies generally prefer to use a method of identifying and classifying the causes of defects, a system for predicting the rise of defects becomes important matter to reduce this harmful issue. However, the currently used methods are kinds of reactive systems that are focused on the defects which occurred already, and there are few studies on the occurrence of defects with prediction systems. This paper is about preliminary study on the development of judgemental algorithm that informs us whether additional works related to defect issue are needed or not. Among machine learning techniques, deep neural network was utilized as prediction model which is a major component of algorithm. It is the most suitable model to be applied to the algorithm when there are 8 hidden layers and the average number of nodes in each hidden layer is 70. Ultimately, the algorithm can identify and defects that may arise in later and contribute to minimize defect frequency."

In Korean,a sentence is a sequence of eojeols (words) separated by spaces. Each eojeol comprises one or more morphemes. Korean morphologicalanalysis (KMA) is to divide eojeols in a given Korean sentence into morpheme units. It also includes assigning appropriatepart-of-speech(POS) tags to the resulting morphemes. KMA is one of the most important tasks in Korean natural language processing(NLP). Improving the performance of KMA is closely related to increasing performance of Korean NLP tasks. Recent research on KMAhas begun to adopt the approach of machine translation (MT) models. MT is to convert a sequence (sentence) of units of one domaininto a sequence (sentence) of units of another domain. Neural machine translation (NMT) stands for the approaches of MT that exploitneural network models. From a perspective of MT, KMA is to transform an input sequence of units belonging to the eojeol domain intoa sequence of units in the morpheme domain. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model for KMA. The backbone of our modelis based on the BERT-fused model which was shown to achieve high performance on NMT. The BERT-fused model utilizes Transformer,a representative model employed by NMT, and BERT which is a language representation model that has enabled a significant advancein NLP. The experimental results show that our model achieves 98.24 F1-Score."

There is a magma chamber beneath Cheonji, and variations in the magma chamber cause volcanic antecedents such as changes in the temperature and water pressure of hot spring water. Consequently, there is an abnormal region in Cheonji where ice melts quicker than in other areas, freezes late even during the freezing period, and has a high-temperature water surface. The abnormal area is a discharge region for hot spring water, and its ice gradient may be used to monitor volcanic activity. However, due to geographical, political and spatial issues, periodic observation of abnormal regions of Cheonji is limited. In this study, the degree of ice change in the optimal region was quantified using a Landsat -5/-7/-8 optical satellite image and a Modified U-Net regression model. From January 22, 1985 to December 8, 2020, the Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) band of 83 Landsat images including anomalous regions was utilized. Using the relative spectral reflectance of water and ice in the VNIR band, unique data were generated for quantitative ice variability monitoring. To preserve as much information as possible from the visible and near-infrared bands, ice gradient was noticed by applying it to U-Net with two encoders, achieving good prediction accuracy with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 140 and a correlation value of 0.9968. Since the ice change value can be seen with high precision from Landsat images using Modified U-Net in the future may be utilized as one of the methods to monitor Baekdu Mountain's volcanic activity, and a more specific volcano monitoring system can be built."

Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has improved mine detection performance, compared to metal detection, in that it can detect non-metallic landmines not found by conventional detectors. Also, GPR can check the detected landmines via video, increasing the detection rate and lowering the false alarm rate. Even though many studies on artificial intelligence with radar signals have been discussed to enhance the performance of image identification, private-level research based on actual GPR data has been difficult to conduct owing to military security. This paper confirmed 99.5% accuracy by applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on GPR data from Mine Detector II, scheduled for use by the army, which is more accurate than in previous studies. In addition, we conducted experiments based on three soil types and confirmed accuracies of 100%, 99%, and 98.9%. We expect accuracy will increase further with the accumulation of data from field operations. In the future, research will be conducted to reduce the false alarm rate by learning the waveforms of mine-like substances."

Firstly, the Backbone network is used for feature extraction, and the attention mechanism is fused to represent different features, so that the network can fully extract the texture and semantic features of the defect area. The extracted features are then weighted and fused, so as to reduce the loss of information. Next, the weighted fused features are transferred to the Neck network, the semantic features and texture features of different layers are fused by FPN, and the defect target is located more accurately by PAN. In the detection network, the CIOU loss function is used to replace the GIOU loss function to locate the image defect area quickly and accurately, generate the bounding box, and predict the defect category. The results show that compared with the original network, YOLOv5-SE and YOLOv5-CBAMachieve an improvement of 8.95% and 12.87% in detection accuracy respectively. The improved networks can identify the location and category of defects more accurately, and greatly improve the accuracy of defect detection of Thangka images."

Traffic control hand signal recognition using convolution and recurrent neural networks,2022,"['autonomous driving', 'traffic control hand signal', 'deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Gesture understanding is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision. Among them, traffic hand signal recognition requires the consideration of speed and the validity of the commanding signal. The lack of available datasets is also a serious problem. Most classifiers approach these problems using the skeletons of target actors in an image. Extracting the three-dimensional coordinates of skeletons is simplified when depth information accompanies the images. However, depth cameras cost significantly more than RGB cameras. Furthermore, the extraction of the skeleton needs to be performed in prior. Here, we show a hand signal detection algorithm without skeletons. Instead of skeletons, we use simple object detectors trained to acquire hand directions. The variance in the time length of gestures mixed with random pauses and noise is handled with a recurrent neural network (RNN). Furthermore, we have developed a flag sequence algorithm to assess the validity of the commanding signal. In whole, the computed hand directions are sent to the RNN, which identifies six types of hand signals given by traffic controllers with the ability to distinguish time variations and intermittent randomly appearing noises. We constructed a hand signal dataset composed of 100 thousand RGB images that is made publicly available. We achieved correct recognition of the hand signals with various backgrounds at 91% accuracy. A processing speed of 30 FPS in FHD video streams, which is a 52% improvement over the best among previous works, was achieved. Despite the extra burden of deciding the validity of the hand signals, this method surpasses methods that solely use RGB video streams. Our work is capable of performing with nonstationary viewpoints, such as those taken from moving vehicles. To accomplish this goal, we set a higher priority for the speed and validity assessment of the recognized commanding signals. The collected dataset is made publicly available through the Korean government portal under the URL “data.go.kr/data/15075814/fileData.do.”"

Differential testing is also used in artificial intelligence systems. Existing research involves the cost of finding a high-quality reference neural network with the same function as the target neural network but different architectures. We propose a self-differential testing technique that evaluates a classification model by making a reference model using a target neural network without the need to find the neural network of another architecture when differential testing. Experiments confirmed that self-differential testing produced similar effects at a lower cost than the existing research that requires other reference models.In addition, we propose an accuracy approximation method for classification models using self-differential analysis, which is an application of self-differential testing. The approximate accuracy through self-differential testing was confirmed to show a small difference of 0.0002 to 0.09 from the actual accuracy in experiments using similar datasets of MNIST and CIFAR10."

Autonomous driving technologies are largely divided into three stages which are perception, decision and control, and AI is making great research achievements in the perception. So far, the LiDAR sensor has been considered as a primary sensing media since it provides accurate depth information. Nevertheless, researchers have sought the alternative of the LiDAR due to the high cost and power consumption, as well as its unattractive design. In this work, we present an alternative, cost-effective and highly accurate 3D object detection mechanism built upon a simple stereo camera sensor, while providing performance comparable to the one based on LiDAR sensor. By converting images into point cloud called Pseudo-LiDAR and using it, then we can achieve 3.6x greater accuracy than image based algorithms. In terms of speed, we can achieve 18x faster inference time than MV3D or F-PointNet. In conclusion, an accurate and cost-effective object detector can be made by combining Complex-YOLO and the Pseudo-LiDAR method."

The superpixel technique can recover partially visible anomaly patterns and suppress noise outside the recovered anomaly patches. We trained the proposed model using an industrial dataset MVTec and compared its performance with state-of-the-art pseudo-anomalous method [11]. Our method shows comparable pixel based percentage area under the receiver operating characteristic (%AUROC) of 96.0% which is only 1.3% less than the performance of DRAEM.

Polyp image has significant appearance shifts, which eventually impact the performance. So, a deep learning model that generalizes unseen images is in high demand. This paper introduced a practical approach to improving domain shift issues. Firstly, we unified the style transfer with the segmentation model into one framework to diminish the appearance shifts problems and do segmentation alongside. Secondly, with the help of Adaptive Instance Normalization, we transferred the style precisely and dynamically in the earlier layers of the segmentation model.

Therefore, since the CNN-based methods can automatically extract features of fingerprint images, they have an advantage of shortening the process. In addition, since they can learn various features of incomplete or low-quality fingerprints, they have flexibility for feature extraction in exceptional situations. In this paper, we intend to identify the research trends of CNN-based fingerprint classification and discuss future direction of research through the analysis of experimental methods and results."

News from internet sources tend, since they are accessible and convenient, to travel quicker and simpler than conventional news sources. However, not all of the media reports obtained from unverified sources are authentic as fake news arises in large numbers and is prevalent in online communities for both political and commercial reasons.Fake news can deceive or misinform readers theoretically or intentionally because people will easily get tangled by any of this information which may impact on the offline community. Although some manual websites are designed to check if the piece of information is true, the volume of quick-spread information online, notably on the web, does not scale. In order to solve this issue automatic fact-checking applications were designed to tackle the requirement of scalability and automation. However, current application methods lack an inclusive multi-dimensional data set to identify fake news features to improve machine learning classification model performance. To overcome this problem, this research paper proposed the Hoax chatbot which classifies the data when user enters an article headline into it. In this research work, the classification of dataset has been done using recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The fake and true news dataset are preprocessed and used to train the model. Saved model is deployed on the discord server in order to check the credibility of the given input text. Discord API gives an access to run python files into their chatbot. In terms of analysis, the proposed model outperforms already existed neural network model such as convolutional neural network (CNN) with an accuracy of 96.77%."

This technology is currently being actively studied worldwide. To detect potential dangers on road and decide actions to evade, the vehicle has to predict nearby objects’ movements correctly. Vehicle path prediction can be categorized into two large groups : physics based model and network based model. Physics based model predicts short term paths with high precision. This model doesn’t take into account the context of the environment, thereby is inappropriate for long term path prediction. Network based model receives the context of the scene as an input, so it performs better at predicting long term paths. But physical movement of the vehicle is not taken into account when generating paths, making unrealistic predictions. In this paper, path prediction algorithm considering both dynamic characteristics of vehicle and scene context is proposed for short-term, long-term prediction. Constant velocity, constant turn rate and velocity model is used in Extended Kalman Filter for interacting multiple models algorithm to predict physics based prediction, and time series data is used in LSTM for Network based prediction. Two predicted outputs are then combined by a weighting function in respect to prediction time.

First, the two-stage classification consists of two steps - the perplexity-based classification and the standard BERT-based classification. 1) the perplexity-based classification first prepares two types of BERTs, i.e., control-specific and patients-specific BERTs, pretrained from transcripts for controls and patients as the additional pretraining datasets, respectively, and then performs a simple threshold-based classification based on the difference between perplexity values of two BERTs for an input test transcript; then, for ambiguous cases where the perplexity difference only does not provide sufficient evidence for the classification, the standard BERT-based classification is performed based on a fine-tuned BERT. Second, the co-attention mechanism enriches the BERT-based representations from a doctor’s transcript and a client’s one by applying the cross-attention over them using the shared affinity matrix, and performs the classification based on the enriched co-attentive representations. Experiment results on a large-scale dataset of Korean transcripts show that the proposed two-stage classification outperforms the baseline BERT model on 4 out of 7 subtasks and the use of the co-attention mechanism achieves the best F1 score for 4 out of 8 subtasks."

To resolve this problem, we here present a framework, which accurately predicts the average and maximum level of WIP and analyzes the main causes of changes in the level of WIP. We conducted experimental studies to show the outperformance of TabNet with competitive machine-learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach obtained R2 0.86 and 0.95 for the average level of WIP and the maximum level of WIP, respectively. Furthermore, a model-agnostic interpretation method, Shapley additive explanations, was used to identify the significant variables for predictions."

At the same time, the Chosŏn armies also witnessed the tactical mistake made by their enemy whose overly deep penetration into the inland areas of the Chosŏn territory inadvertently left themselves susceptible to isolation with an overextended (about 520 kilometers) front from Pusan to Seoul to Pyŏngyang · Hamhŭng. After the second half of 1592, the Chosŏn military pursued a comprehensive tactical measure against the Japanese armies that would engage themselves in attrition warfare able simultaneously to resolve their shortage of military supplies, including provisions, within the territory of Chosŏn proper and maintain their unexpectedly expanded battlefield. In this article, I explore how the Chosŏn court and military prepared the anti-Japanese countermeasures even before the large-scale overseas deployment of the Ming armies in the beginning of 1593 and sought for the strengthening of their own military power in the middle of the peace negotiations between the Ming and Japan after the first quarter of 1593. In specific, what emerged as the fundamental solution for how to strengthen the anti-Japanese combat power of ground force was a set of regional defense, or 1) mountain fortification (設險), such as mountain fortress or mountain barricade, in terms of maximizing the capacity of natural defense and 2) scorched earth policy (淸野) in terms of blocking completely any access to supply sources for local procurement of the Japanese armies. Moreover, not only joint operations (掎角) within the troops of a province and among the troops of multiple provinces, but also ambush (要害), geared towards surprise attack, encirclement or obstruction, were brought out as a set of mobile defense intended to complement the regional defense as above. This approach will enable us to chart further research that probes how the Chosŏn court and military made effort to increase the anti-Japanese defensive power, centered on combat strength of Chosŏn armies, examine what kinds of military tactics the Japanese armies employed for a new offensive as opposed to Chosŏn, and shed light on internal structures of the Imjin War as an international war in Northeast Asia at that time."

To determine if people had a consistent preference for form, experiment participants were asked to select the preferred images among 200 images twice, which were automatically generated in dynamo. In the two consecutive image selection processes, ten participants repeatedly selected the same images at a rate of 79 percent. These results confirmed that there is a consistent preference for form. Next, the possibility of identifying the preference for form using CNN was investigated. Data for each experiment participant was divided into two sets. The preferred and non-preferred images were included in each set at a certain percentage. A classification model was produced by conducting supervised learning using CNN with one of the two sets. The classification accuracy was measured by applying this classification model to the other set.

In this paper, we present a novel approach based on unsupervised domain adaptation method to alleviate the distribution shift problem for noisy SER. Specifically, we apply an adversarial domain adaptation with bridge mechanism to model an intermediate domain for knowledge transfer. We construct a bridge layer by exploiting speech denoising approach to extract the domain-specific noise representation. Experimental results show that our method provides average improvements of 2.29% and 3.88% in weighted and unweighted accuracies over the baseline for SER with various noise settings."

The purpose of the PIN algorithm is for enabling an active rehabilitation exercise, which is implemented by estimating the patient's motion and classifying the intention. Existing rehabilitation involves the inconvenience of attaching a sensor directly to the patient's skin. In addition, the rehabilitation device moves the patient, which is a passive rehabilitation method. Our algorithm consists of two steps. First, we estimate the user's joint position through the OpenPose algorithm, which is efficient in estimating 2D human pose in an image. Second, an intention classifier is constructed for classifying the motions into three categories, and a sequence of images including joint information is used as input. The intention network also learns correlations between joints and changes in joints over a short period of time, which can be easily used to determine the intention of the motion. To implement the proposed algorithm and conduct real-world experiments, we collected our own dataset, which is composed of videos of three classes. The network is trained using short segment clips of the video. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective for classifying intentions based on a short video clip."
Improvement in Object Detection Using Multi-Scale RoI Pooling and Feature Pyramid Network,2022,"['Region of interest pooling', 'Feature pyramid network', 'Object detection', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The feature pyramid network (FPN) enhances the localization accuracy and detection performance of small objects using multiple scales of the features. FPN adopts lateral connections and a top-down pathway to make low-level features semantically more meaningful. However, it uses only single-scale features to pool regions of interest (RoIs) when detecting objects. In this study, we showed that single-scale RoI pooling may not be the best solution for accurate localization and proposed multi-scale RoI pooling to improve the minor drawbacks of the FPN. The proposed method pools RoIs from three feature levels and concatenates the pooled features to detect objects. Thus, the FPN with multi-scale RoI pooling, called FPN+, detects objects by taking into account all information scattered across three feature levels. FPN+ improved the FPN by 2.81 and 1.1 points in COCO-style average precision (AP) when tested on PASCAL VOC 2007 test and COCO 2017 validation datasets, respectively."

The teacher network utilizes EO and SAR images simultaneously to produce richer features and provide them to the student network, while the student network only uses EO images.

Furthermore, we introduce deformable convolution to avoid pixel-level noise and efficiently capture hard samples such as small and thin buildings at the global level.

The difficulty of controlling COVID-19 poses a threat to the global health sector. Considering that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has contributed to improving research methods and solving problems facing diverse fields of study, AI algorithms have also proven effective in disease detection and early diagnosis. Specifically, acoustic features offer a promising prospect for the early detection of respiratory diseases. Motivated by these observations, this study conceptualized a speech-based diagnostic model to aid in COVID-19 diagnosis. The proposed methodology uses speech signals from confirmed positive and negative cases of COVID-19 to extract features through the pre-trained Visual Geometry Group (VGG-16) model based on Mel spectrogram images. This is used in addition to the K-means algorithm that determines effective features, followed by a Genetic Algorithm-Support Vector Machine (GA-SVM) classifier to classify cases. The experimental findings indicate the proposed methodology's capability to classify COVID-19 and NOT COVID-19 of varying ages and speaking different languages, as demonstrated in the simulations. The proposed methodology depends on deep features, followed by the dimension reduction technique for features to detect COVID-19. As a result, it produces better and more consistent performance than handcrafted features used in previous studies."

Multimodal Attention-Based Fusion Model for Context- Aware Emotion Recognition,2022,"['Context-aware', 'Multimodal fusion', 'Attention-based fusion', 'Emotion recognition', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Human Emotion Recognition is an exciting topic that has been attracting many researchers for a lengthy time.In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in exploiting contextual information on emotion recognition. Some previous explorations in psychology show that emotional perception is impacted by facial expressions, as well as contextual information from the scene, such as human activities, interactions, and body poses. Those explorations initialize a trend in computer vision in exploring the critical role of contexts, by considering them as modalities to infer predicted emotion along with facial expressions. However, the contextual information has not been fully exploited. The scene emotion created by the surrounding environment, can shape how people perceive emotion. Besides, additive fusion in multimodal training fashion is not practical, because the contributions of each modality are not equal to the final prediction. The purpose of this paper was to contribute to this growing area of research, by exploring the effectiveness of the emotional scene gist in the input image, to infer the emotional state of the primary target. The emotional scene gist includes emotion, emotional feelings, and actions or events that directly trigger emotional reactions in the input image.We also present an attention-based fusion network, to combine multimodal features based on their impacts on the target emotional state. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, through a significant improvement on the EMOTIC dataset."

Image Captioning with Synergy-Gated Attention and Recurrent Fusion LSTM,2022,"['Image captioning', 'Synergy-Gated Attention', 'Recurrent Fusion LSTM', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) combined with attention mechanism is extensively used to generate semantic sentences of images in image captioning models. However, features of salient regions and spatial information are not utilized sufficiently in most related works. Meanwhile, the LSTM also suffers from the problem of underutilized information in a single time step. In the paper, two innovative approaches are proposed to solve these problems. First, the Synergy-Gated Attention (SGA) method is proposed, which can process the spatial features and the salient region features of given images simultaneously. SGA establishes a gated mechanism through the global features to guide the interaction of information between these two features. Then, the Recurrent Fusion LSTM (RF-LSTM) mechanism is proposed, which can predict the next hidden vectors in one time step and improve linguistic coherence by fusing future information. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset of MSCOCO show that compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can improve the performance of image captioning model, and achieve competitive performance on multiple evaluation indicators."

A ground structure consists of a set of interconnected bars similar to a graph structure. The number of bars and joints depends on the size and configuration of the target design domains. Conventional neural networks, such as MLP and CNN, cannot handle such variable-dimensional data. Therefore, we adopted a graph neural network using the similarity between ground structure and graph. Only a few of the potential bar candidates remained after ground structure optimization converged. It causes the highly imbalanced distribution of bar areas, which is difficult to predict. Therefore, we construct the model to process a binary classification task to classify the presence or absence of remaining bars among potential bar candidates, and then sequentially process a regression task to predict the detailed value of the cross-sectional areas. To validate the proposed model, three types of ground structure optimization problems were defined: cantilever, simply supported, and L-shape beams. The model was evaluated with three evaluation metrics: classification, regression, and optimality. As a result, it predicts the presence or absence of the optimal ground structure with more than 95% accuracy and predicts the cross-sectional areas of the remaining bars with greater than 95% accuracy."

Additionally, cyberattacks for political and economic purposes are also being carried out by groups which is sponsored by its nation. To deal with cyberattacks, researchers used to classify the malware family and the subjects of the attack based on malware signature. Unfortunately, attackers can easily masquerade as other group. Also, as the attack varies with subject, techniques, and purpose, it is more effective for defenders to identify the attacker’s purpose and goal to respond appropriately. The essential goal of cyberattacks is to threaten the information security of the target assets. Information security is achieved by preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the assets.In this paper, we relabel the attacker’s goal based on MITRE ATT&CKⓇ in the point of CIA triad as well as classifying cyber security reports to verify the labeling method. Experimental results show that the model classified the proposed CIA label with at most 80% probability."

The results show that the convolutional neural network attempted to learn the relationship between the input gamma-ray spectrum and the nuclide type, and could identify the nuclide based on the photoelectric peak and Compton edge.Furthermore, the results explain why the neural network could identify gamma-ray spectra with low counts and low signal-to-noise ratios.

Because this method does not use information of skeleton that is difficult to acquire and complicated to estimate, it can be used in general CCTV environment in which only video camera is used. The novelty of MRGCN is that it expresses the optical flow and gradient of the input image as directional histograms and then converts it into six feature vectors to reduce the amount of computational load and uses a newly developed radial type network model to hierarchically propagate the deformation and shape change of the human body in spatio-temporal space. Another important feature is that the data input areas are arranged being overlapped each other, so that information is not spatially disconnected among input nodes. As a result of performing MRGCN's action recognition performance evaluation experiment for 30 actions, it was possible to obtain Top-1 accuracy of 84.78%, which is superior to the existing GCN-based action recognition method using skeleton data as an input."

Current practices and case laws have dealt with audio-file-storage devices in the manner similar to transcripts of tape-recording or documents containing statement, and decided the integrity and identity of digital voice-recorded file with the mere hash value standard. When the possibility of forgingㆍaltering the digital audio file is at issue of criminal procedure, the current practices of over-credulity in hash value need to be changed in light of developed audio-file technology. The identity of the submitted file with the original file should be able to be acknowledged regardless of change of hash value. It should not be able to be acknowledged regardless of the same hash value in case other circumstantial evidences are proposed and professionally accepted. Currently, new factors to decide integrity and identity of voice-recording files are coming out such as audio file format-structure analysis, audio-signal analysis, and AI program discerning forgeryㆍaltercation.In light of the current situation where identity of digital evidences, particularly voice-recording files, becomes an essential issue, existent legislation and case law of criminal justice area urgently need to be changed so as to secure an expert witness examination and testimony. It will contribute to balance between fact-finding and due process. So as to prevent postponement of criminal trials dealing with voice-recording files, the changed law and practice need to accompany both the adoption of preventative measures of blocking disputes on integrity and identity of digital files during investigation, and the aggressive usage of Professional Investigative Advisers(PIAs).

For example, in an experiment using a counterfeit license plate, there are cases of successful entry into major government agencies. This paper proposes an improved system over the existing artificial intelligence parking control system to prevent vehicles with such fake license plates from entering. The proposed method is to use the degree of matching of the front feature points of the vehicle as a passing criterion using the ORB algorithm that extracts information on feature points characterized by an image, just as the existing system uses the matching of vehicle license plates as a passing criterion. In addition, a procedure for checking whether a vehicle exists inside was included in the proposed system to prevent the entry of the same type of vehicle with a fake license plate. As a result of the experiment, it showed the improved performance in identifying vehicles with fake license plates compared to the existing system. These results confirmed that the methods proposed in this paper could be applied to the existing parking control system while taking the flow of the original artificial intelligence parking control system to prevent vehicles with fake license plates from entering."

To solve the OOV problem in dependency parsing, we explored the proper noun embedding method according to the embedding unit. Before representing words in a continuous vector space, we replace the proper nouns with a special token and train them for the contextual features by using the multi-layer bidirectional LSTM. Two models of the syllable-based and morpheme-based unit are proposed for proper noun embedding and the performance of the dependency parsing is more improved in the ensemble model than each syllable and morpheme embedding model.

However, since this method of extracting features only focuses on extracting some of the features, it lacks textual information mining from multiple perspectives and dimensions, resulting in the model not being able to fully capture semantic features. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Multi-view Semantic Feature Fusion Model (MSFM). The proposed model mainly consists of two core components, that is, Multi-view Semantic Feature Fusion Embedding Module (MFEM) and Multi-head Self-Attention Mechanism Module (MSAM). Specifically, the MFEM extracts character features, word boundary features, radical features, and pinyin features of Chinese characters. The acquired font shape, font sound, and font meaning features are fused to enhance the semantic information of Chinese characters with different granularities. Moreover, the MSAM is used to capture the dependencies between characters in a multi-dimensional subspace to better understand the semantic features of the context. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that our method improves the overall performance of the CNER model."

Therefore, this paper implements existing anomaly detection algorithms and compares their performance, and based on this, we present the issue of anomaly detection in digital twin environments and future research directions for contextual outlier detection (CAD)."

Google has just announced the launch of Objectron that has a novel data pipeline using mobile augmented reality session data.However, it also is corresponding to 2D-driven 3D object detection technique. This study explores more mature 2D object detection method, and applies its 2D projection to Objectron 3D lifting system. Most object detection methods use bounding boxes to encode and represent the object shape and location.In this work, we explore a stochastic representation of object regions using Gaussian distributions. We also present a similarity measure for the Gaussian distributions based on the Hellinger Distance, which can be viewed as a stochastic Intersection-over-Union. Our experimental results show that the proposed Gaussian representations are closer to annotated segmentation masks in available datasets.

This study aims to suggest the directions of work support for AI tools that can effectively and efficiently support work in the design process.Methods Through a literature review, we investigated trends in utilizing AI in the design field and research trends in AI-based design support tools. We also analyzed the trends of adopting AI tools for design work by selecting some of the existing AI design support tools. Through in-depth interviews with designers, their needs for work assistance were identified. Through in-depth interviews with AI experts, we explored possibilities of using AI tools in design work. In addition, we proposed directions for work support of AI tools that can help designers’ work effectively.Results The results of in-depth interviews showed that designers mostly needed the assistance of others when planning for project directions and making decisions based on objective judgment.

First, designers need AI support tools that assist design planning works by collecting and analyzing data suitable for project purposes and provide objective data necessary for decision-making tasks. Second, it is necessary to systematically help the idea generation and convergence process by reflecting the planning intention. Third, AI tools as a system are needed to manage design tasks integrally and organically according to the project purpose.

For locating the small ganglia in medical images, their sectional anatomy should be learned by medical students and doctors. The purpose of this study is to elucidate cranial ganglia anatomy using sectioned images and three-dimensional (3D) models of a cadaver.Methods: One thousand two hundred and forty-six sectioned images of a male cadaver were examined to identify the cranial nerve ganglia. Using the real color sectioned images, real color volume model having a voxel size of 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm was produced.Results: The sectioned images and 3D models can be downloaded for free from a webpage, anatomy.dongguk.ac.kr/ganglia. On the images and model, all the cranial nerve ganglia and their whole course were identified. In case of the facial nerve, the geniculate, pterygopalatine, and submandibular ganglia were clearly identified. In case of the glossopharyngeal nerve, the superior, inferior, and otic ganglia were found. Thanks to the high resolution and real color of the sectioned images and volume models, detailed observation of the ganglia was possible. Since the volume models can be cut both in orthogonal planes and oblique planes, advanced sectional anatomy of the ganglia can be explained concretely.Conclusions: The sectioned images and 3D models will be helpful resources for understanding cranial nerve ganglia anatomy, for performing related surgical procedures."

Diverse machine learning or deep learning models have been developed to predict DILI. However, these models have not provided an adequate understanding of the mechanisms leading to DILI. The development of safer drugs requires novel computational approaches that enable the prompt understanding of the mechanism of DILI. In this study, the mechanisms leading to the development of cholestasis, steatosis, hepatitis, and cirrhosis were explored using a semi-automated approach for data gathering and associations. Diverse data from ToxCast, Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD), Reactome, and Open TG-GATEs on reference molecules leading to the development of the respective diseases were extracted. The data were used to create biological networks of the four diseases. As expected, the four networks had several common pathways, and a joint DILI network was assembled. Such biological networks could be used in drug discovery to identify possible molecules of concern as they provide a better understanding of the disease-specific key events. The events can be target-tested to provide indications for potential DILI effects."

Embedded High Accuracy Compact Transformer Vision System for Real-Time Health Detection During Seedling Transplanting,2022,"['Computer vision', 'Seedling transplanting', 'Transformers']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Seedling transplanting is an important step in plant production to transplant seedlings into low-density trays at specific growth stages while discarding unhealthy seedlings. Several health detection methods based on machine learning or deep learning have been proposed. However there are still gaps in accuracy and efficiency compared to manual work. In this study, we proposed an embedded compact transformer vision system for real-time health detection during seedling transplanting. The vision system consisted of a camera (Kinect Azure) capturing RGB images in real time and a detection algorithm in an embedded PC (Jetson AGX Xavier). We introduced compact Transformers in the detection algorithm by designing the appropriate size and convolutional tokeniztion, so that the model had fewer parameters (22.58M) while outperforming the current state-of-the-art CNN models. In the validation experiment, two groups of paprika seedlings were cultivated to distinguish healthy and unhealthy by treating water stress. The algorithm showed 94.4% accuracy in the random tests. The experimental results quantitatively demonstrate that the accuracy of our method is competitive for manual. The proposed simple and compact transformers algorithm performs well in embedded devices with limited computational resources. High accuracy detection of seedling health is achieved, which promotes the practical development of future automatic transplanting robots."

Our investigations show that deep learning (DL) based modulation recognition techniques have achieved effective progress for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, network complexity is always an additional burden for high-accuracy classifications, which makes it impractical. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a low-complexity dimensional interactive lightweight network (DilNet) for MIMO systems. Specifically, the signals received by different antennas are cooperatively input into the network, and the network calculation amount is reduced through the depth-wise separable convolution. A two-dimensional interactive attention (TDIA) module is designed to extract interactive information of different dimensions, and improve the effectiveness of the cooperation features. In addition, the TDIA module ensures low complexity through compressing the convolution dimension, and the computational burden after inserting TDIA is also acceptable. Finally, the network is trained with a penalized statistical entropy loss function. Simulation results show that compared to existing modulation recognition methods, the proposed DilNet dramatically reduces the model complexity. The dimensional interactive lightweight network trained by penalized statistical entropy also performs better for recognition accuracy in MIMO systems."

Traditional image retrieval techniques use global or local features to search for similar images, which makes it difficult to obtain object information if a given image has a complex background or if the object of the image is small. To address this, we propose object embedding and image retrieval techniques using the latest object recognition models, DETR (Detection Transformer) and Bag of Visual Words (BoVW), which can represent object information regardless of background.

Our model predicts the amount of photovoltaic power generation using RNN, LSTM, and GRU models, which are recurrent neural network techniques specialized for time series data, and compares and analyzes each model with different hyperparameters, and evaluates the performance. As a result, the MSE and RMSE indicators of all three models were very close to 0, and the R2 indicator showed performance close to 1.

A promising solution for the NIDS is an autoencoder, a type of deep learning model. The conventional autoencoder uses only the input and output layers to detect intrusion, which draws a limitation. In this case, the information embedded in hidden layers would be ignored. The hidden layers of the autoencoder should be included in the detection process since they have information about the data. In order to overcome such limitations, we propose a novel anomaly detection solution that utilizes not only the input and output layers of the autoencoder but also hidden layers of the autoencoder to improve the detection performance. To evaluate the detection performance of the proposed solution, we use two popular network intrusion data sets and compare our solution with existing state-of-the-art methods. As a result, we confirm that the proposed solution outperforms other comparison methods.

가중치 VAE 오버샘플링(W-VAE)을 이용한 보안데이터셋 샘플링 기법 연구,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recently, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, research to use artificial intelligence to detect hacking attacks is being actively conducted. However, the fact that security data is a representative imbalanced data is recognized as a major obstacle in composing the learning data, which is the key to the development of artificial intelligence models. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a W-VAE oversampling technique that applies VAE, a deep learning generation model, to data extraction for oversampling, and sets the number of oversampling for each class through weight calculation using K-NN for sampling. In this paper, a total of five oversampling techniques such as ROS, SMOTE, and ADASYN were applied through NSL-KDD, an open network security dataset. The oversampling method proposed in this paper proved to be the most effective sampling method compared to the existing oversampling method through the F1-Score evaluation index."
Prediction of Wave Transmission Characteristics of Low Crested Structures Using Artificial Neural Network,2022,"['Artificial neural network', 'Wave transmission', 'Coastal engineering', 'Prediction', 'Sensitivity analysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recently around the world, coastal erosion is paying attention as a social issue. Various constructions using low-crested and submerged structures are being performed to deal with the problems. In addition, a prediction study was researched using machine learning techniques to determine the wave attenuation characteristics of low crested structure to develop prediction matrix for wave attenuation coefficient prediction matrix consisting of weights and biases for ease access of engineers. In this study, a deep neural network model was constructed to predict the wave height transmission rate of low crested structures using Tensor flow, an open source platform. The neural network model shows a reliable prediction performance and is expected to be applied to a wide range of practical application in the field of coastal engineering. As a result of predicting the wave height transmission coefficient of the low crested structure depends on various input variable combinations, the combination of 5 condition showed relatively high accuracy with a small number of input variables defined as 0.961. In terms of the time cost of the model, it is considered that the method using the combination 5 conditions can be a good alternative. As a result of predicting the wave transmission rate of the trained deep neural network model, MSE was 1.3×10<SUP>-3</SUP>, I was 0.995, SI was 0.078, and I was 0.979, which have very good prediction accuracy. It is judged that the proposed model can be used as a design tool by engineers and scientists to predict the wave transmission coefficient behind the low crested structure."

He had a very deep interest in Chinese classics and  ceremonies. During his lifetime, immersed in nurturing juniors, he authored a vast authorship of 29 volumes and 15 books.In particular, his interest in Sohak was different. The three books of Sohakjanggu, Sohakdongjamun, and Sohakhupyeon, are all the research achievements of Sohakhak in the late Joseon Dynasty.Sohakhupyeon is a book that was completed when he was 29 years old (1801). As the book name suggests, it has the character of a sequel to Sohak, and is organized into two chapters, Gaeon and Seonhaeng, which are the oepyeons of Sohak.The Gaeon chapter was divided into Gwangipgyo, Gwangmyeongryun and Gwanggyeongsin. The Seonhaeng chapter was divided into Silipgyo, Silmyungryun and Silgyeongsin. And all had 153 clauses.The features of this book are as follows.First, Sohakhupyeon is a Sohakseolyu created by faithfully inheriting the intention and system of Zhu Xi's writing of Sohak.Second, using the words of Zhu Xi as the main point of the text, Chinese figures after the Yuan Dynasty and Joseon figures after the Goryeo Dynasty who had exemplary conduct were selected and proved.Third, Korean figures were composed of those who succeeded in the genealogy of Confucianism in Joseon, those who led the study of the Toegye School in Yeongnam, and the Geungi namin scholars including Lee Ik. This point implies that Sohakhupyeon has an important intention to make it an introductory book to Sohak in Yeongnam, which learns the exemplary language and behavior of the Yeongnam Toegye School and Geungi namin.On the other hand, this book importantly cites Ahn Jung-bok and Nam Han-jo's critical views on Seohak. This has significance as the first Sohakseolyu to record anti-Seohak discussions in Yeongnam at the time."
Improved Minimum Spanning Tree based Image Segmentation with Guided Matting,2022,"['Graph Theory', 'Guided Feathering', 'Image Segmentation', 'Minimum Spanning Tree']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In image segmentation, for the condition that objects (targets) and background in an image are intertwined or their common boundaries are vague as well as their textures are similar, and the targets in images are greatly variable, the deep learning might be difficult to use. Hence, a new method based on graph theory and guided feathering is proposed. First, it uses a guided feathering algorithm to initially separate the objects from background roughly, then, the image is separated into two different images: foreground image and background image, subsequently, the two images are segmented accurately by using the improved graph-based algorithm respectively, and finally, the two segmented images are merged together as the final segmentation result. For the graph-based new algorithm, it is improved based on MST in three main aspects: (1) the differences between the functions of intra-regional and inter-regional; (2) the function of edge weight; and (3) re-merge mechanism after segmentation in graph mapping. Compared to the traditional algorithms such as region merging, ordinary MST and thresholding, the studied algorithm has the better segmentation accuracy and effect, therefore it has the significant superiority."

S. Childs and James Sanders as belonging to the third moment in their canonical interpretation.Based on Brueggemann’s observation, the author aims to revisit the canon debate initiated by Childs and J. A. Sanders about four decades ago, together with their adherents and followers in the biblical studies both in the Old Testament and the New Testament. After mapping out the overall key issues in the debates, the author delves into the problem of the definition and nature of the Jewish and Christian canon. He then presents the two competing models in shaping canon as an extrinsic model versus intrinsic model, followed by two competing approaches to the interpretation of canon between Sanders and Childs in terms of differences in the naming of their ways of interpretation (canonical criticism versus canonical approach), the differences in focus (canonical process versus final form), and the differences in the nature of Canon (adaptability and stability versus vehicle of God’s revelation). Next, the author sheds some light on the Western canonical debates from an East Asian perspective in the diverse issues on definition, model, status, and nature of the biblical canon.Finally, the author provides the following East Asian contribution to the canon debate. (1) “Canonical consciousness” lies deep within the religious literature from the inception of authoritative utterance through the canonizing process to the final shape. (2) It seems unnecessary to fall into a dichotomy in the definition of “canon as a rule of faith” (process) versus “canon as a list” (final, fixed, standardized, closed text). (3) The intrinsic model of canon is preferable to the extrinsic model of canon. (4) We may identify the ontology of the biblical canon as the incarnation and inscripturation of God in his Word."

Different from other existing attention methods, this paper employs the channel attention modules without dimensionality reduction along the channel direction from which direct correspondence between feature map channels can be preserved and the features valuable for recognizing SAR target variants can be effectively derived. Experiments with the public benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme is superior to the network with other existing channel attention modules."

Currently, many studies focus on grasping emotion and speech recognition on voice for human-computer interaction and are developing deep neural network models by extracting various frequency characteristics of speech. Representatives of these speech-based deep learning algorithms include speech recognition, namely speech-to-text or automatic speech recognition, and speech emotion recognition. The development of these two algorithms has been developed for a long time, but multi-output algorithms that process them in parallel at the same time are rare. This paper introduces a multi-output model that recognizes speech and emotion in one voice, thinking that simultaneously understanding language and emotion, which are the most critical information in a human voice, will significantly help human-computer interaction. This model confirmed that there was no significant difference between the training of the language and emotion recognition models separately, with a word error rate of 6.59% in the speech recognition section and an accuracy of 79.67% on average in the emotion recognition section."

Given the high number of passengers it may carry, an autonomous train must analyze even more accurately its environment. It must also recognize everything happening in its cars to ensure passengers security. The total absence of railway agents on-board fully autonomous trains brings requirements for a monitoring system. It would include sets of sensors for the acquisition, algorithms for analysis and telecommunication network to transfer either the data or its extracted information. Cameras are the first sensor that comes in mind as they would furnish images of the scenes, copying human vision.

Qualitative Analysis of Single Object and Multi Object Tracking Models,2022,"['Single object tracking', 'Multi-object tracking', 'SiamMask', 'CenterNet', 'SORT', 'YOLO', 'DeepSort', 'TensorFlow', 'OpenCV', 'PyTorch', 'DarkNet', 'Person tracking', 'and Vehicle Tracking']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Tracking the object(s) of interest in the real world is one of the most salient research areas that has gained widespread attention due to its applications. Although different approaches based on traditional machine learning and modern deep learning have been proposed to tackle the single and multi-object tracking problems, these tasks are still challenging to perform. In our work, we conduct a comparative analysis of eleven object trackers to determine the most robust single object tracker (SOT) and multi-object tracker (MOT). The main contributions of our work are (1) employing nine pre-trained tracking algorithms to carry out the analysis for SOT that include: SiamMask, GOTURN, BOOSTING, MIL, KCF, TLD, MedianFlow, MOSSE, CSRT; (2) investigating MOT by integrating object detection models with object trackers using YOLOv4 combined with DeepSort, and CenterNet coupled with SORT; (3) creating our own testing videos dataset to perform experiments; (4) performing the qualitative analysis based on the visual representation of results by considering nine significant factors that are appearance and illumination variations, speed, accuracy, scale, partial and full-occlusion, report failure, and fast motion. Experimental results demonstrate that SiamMask tracker overcomes most of the environmental challenges for SOT while YOLOv+DeepSort tracker obtains good performance for MOT. However, these trackers are not robust enough to handle full occlusion in real-world scenarios and there is always a trade-off between tracking accuracy and speed."

According to the increasing video data, the requirements for analysis and utilization are increasing. Due to the lack of skilled manpower to analyze videos in many industries, machine learning and artificial intelligence are actively used to assist manpower. In this situation, the demand for various computer vision technologies such as object detection and tracking, action detection, emotion detection, and Re-ID also increased rapidly. However, the object detection and tracking technology has many difficulties that degrade performance, such as re-appearance after the object’s departure from the video recording location, and occlusion. Accordingly, action and emotion detection models based on object detection and tracking models also have difficulties in extracting data for each object. In addition, deep learning architectures consist of various models suffer from performance degradation due to bottlenects and lack of optimization.  In this study, we propose an video analysis system consists of YOLOv5 based DeepSORT object tracking model, SlowFast based action recognition model, Torchreid based Re-ID model, and AWS Rekognition which is emotion recognition service. Proposed model uses single-linkage hierarchical clustering based Re-ID and some processing method which maximize hardware throughput. It has higher accuracy than the performance of the re-identification model using simple metrics, near real-time processing performance, and prevents tracking failure due to object departure and re-emergence, occlusion, etc. By continuously linking the action and facial emotion detection results of each object to the same object, it is possible to efficiently analyze videos.  The re-identification model extracts a feature vector from the bounding box of object image detected by the object tracking model for each frame, and applies the single-linkage hierarchical clustering from the past frame using the extracted feature vectors to identify the same object that failed to track. Through the above process, it is possible to re-track the same object that has failed to tracking in the case of re-appearance or occlusion after leaving the video location. As a result, action and facial emotion detection results of the newly recognized object due to the tracking fails can be linked to those of the object that appeared in the past. On the other hand, as a way to improve processing performance, we introduce Bounding Box Queue by Object and Feature Queue method that can reduce RAM memory requirements while maximizing GPU memory throughput. Also we introduce the IoF(Intersection over Face) algorithm that allows facial emotion recognized through AWS Rekognition to be linked with object tracking information.  The academic significance of this study is that the two-stage re-identification model can have real-time performance even in a high-cost environment that performs action and facial emotion detection according to processing techniques without reducing the accuracy by using simple metrics to achieve real-time performance. The practical implication of this study is that in various industrial fields that require action and facial emotion detection but have many difficulties due to the fails in object tracking can analyze videos effectively through proposed model. Proposed model which has high accuracy of retrace and processing performance can be used in various fields such as intelligent monitoring, observation services and behavioral or psychological analysis services where the integration of tracking information and extracted metadata creates greate industrial and business value.  In the future, in order to measure the object tracking performance more precisely, there is a need to conduct an experiment using the MOT Challenge dataset, which is data used by many international conferences.

However, most real-world time series data are non-stationary, which means their statistical properties like mean, and variance varies with time. This property of time series is not considered by most modern deep learning forecasting models, causing the distribution of the training and test sets to be different. Eventually, the accuracy of the forecasting model is significantly affected by the distribution shift. To tackle this problem, we suggest a simple solution called 'Pseudo-Stationarizer.’ This block can be used seamlessly alongside pre-existing forecasting models to obtain better forecasts. ‘Pseudo-Stationarizer’ performs differencing on the original time series to make the data weakly stationary and helps in minimizing the distribution shift. Via thorough experimentation, we prove that the usage of the proposed block aids the forecasting models in getting significant improvements in their performance by diminishing the distribution shift and making the time series weakly stationary."

However, most of the existing segmentation methods are not feasible to be used directly for this task due to the challenge of exact edge prediction with some tiny and slender vessels as its clinical segmentation criterion. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep learning based segmentation model, called Boundary-Aware Dual Attention Liver Segment Segmentation Model (BADA). This model can improve the segmentation accuracy of liver segments with enhancing the edges including the vessels serving as segment boundaries. In our model, the dual gated attention is proposed, which composes of a spatial attention module and a semantic attention module.

Artificial olfactory sensor technology that mimics the olfactory mechanism: a comprehensive review,2022,['blank'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Artificial olfactory sensors that recognize patterns transmitted by olfactory receptors are emerging as a technology for monitoring volatile organic compounds. Advances in statistical processing methods and data processing technology have made it possible to classify patterns in sensor arrays. Moreover, biomimetic olfactory recognition sensors in the form of pattern recognition have been developed. Deep learning and artificial intelligence technologies have enabled the classification of pattern data from more sensor arrays, and improved artificial olfactory sensor technology is being developed with the introduction of artificial neural networks. An example of an artificial olfactory sensor is the electronic nose. It is an array of various types of sensors, such as metal oxides, electrochemical sensors, surface acoustic waves, quartz crystal microbalances, organic dyes, colorimetric sensors, conductive polymers, and mass spectrometers. It can be tailored depending on the operating environment and the performance requirements of the artificial olfactory sensor. This review compiles artificial olfactory sensor technology based on olfactory mechanisms. We introduce the mechanisms of artificial olfactory sensors and examples used in food quality and stability assessment, environmental monitoring, and diagnostics. Although current artificial olfactory sensor technology has several limitations and there is limited commercialization owing to reliability and standardization issues, there is considerable potential for developing this technology. Artificial olfactory sensors are expected to be widely used in advanced pattern recognition and learning technologies, along with advanced sensor technology in the future."

However, the limited number of data and psoriasis characteristic such as ambiguity of severity deteriorate model performance. One of the simple and powerful methods to overcome these problem is data augmentation. Data augmentation should be used according to data characteristics. Therefore, we analyzed and compared the classification results applied with five data augmentation methods, Geometric transformation, CutMix, Visual Corruptions, AutoAugment, RandAugment, and explored data augmentation method suitable for psoriasis severity classification. We used the EfficientNet B2 for psoriasis severity classification. As a result, when RandAugment or the combination of Geometric transform and Visual Corruptions were used, it showed the best classification performance with an accuracy of 87.5%.

To address this problem, gradient subnetwork and gradient-based loss model are incorporated into the generator to alleviate the image structure distortion, however textural distortions still remain a pending issue. Therefore, this paper proposes the SR deep learning model based on the sparse gradient-guided attention and wavelet loss that corrects the texture distortions for better SR image restoration. In particularly, a sparse gradient-guided self-attention to model global interdependency between features is designed, thereby increasing the power of structural reconstruction. In addition, a wavelet-based loss model that more strongly suppresses the textural distortions is presented. Through the experimental results, it is confirmed that the proposed SR model improves the power of texture reconstruction and generates much clearer SR images, compared to the state-of-the-art conventional SR methods."

Multivariate to multivariate time series (MMTS) forecasting is an important factor in manufacturing. MMTS forecasting is a notoriously challenging task considering the need for incorporating both non-linear correlations between variables (inter-relationships) and temporal relationships of each univariate time series (intra-relationships) while forecasting future time steps of each univariate time series (UTS) simultaneously. However, previous works use deep learning models suited for low-dimensional data. These models are insufficient to model high-dimensional relationships inherent in multivariate time series (MTS) data. Furthermore, these models are less productive and efficient as they focus on predicting a single target variable from multiple input variables. Thus, we proposed two phase MTS forecasting. First, the proposed method learns the non-linear correlations between UTS (inter-relationship) through self-attention based convolutional autoencoder and conducts cause analysis. Second, it learns the temporal relationships (intra-relationships) of MTS data through temporal convolutional network and forecasts multiple target outputs. As an end-to-end model, the proposed method is more efficient and derives excellent experimental results."

Due to limitation of GK-2A sensor performance, the level-2 products can not satisfy the requirement, especially for spatial resolution. In this paper, we found the optimal pan-sharpening algorithm for GK-2A products. The six pan-sharpening methods included in CS (Component Substitution), MRA (Multi-Resolution Analysis), VO (Variational Optimization), and DL (Deep Learning) were used. In the case of DL, the synthesis property based method was used to generate training dataset. The process of synthesis property is that pan-sharpening model is applied with Pan (Panchromatic) and MS (Multispectral) images with reduced spatial resolution, and fused image is compared with the original MS image. In the synthesis property based method, fused image with desire level for user can be produced only when the geometric characteristics between the PAN with reduced spatial resolution and MS image are similar. However, since the dissimilarity exists, RD (Random Down-sampling) was additionally used as a way to minimize it. Among the pan-sharpening methods, PSGAN was applied with RD (PSGAN_RD). The fused images are qualitatively and quantitatively validated with consistency property and the synthesis property. As validation result, the GSA algorithm performs well in the evaluation index representing spatial characteristics. In the case of spectral characteristics, the PSGAN_RD has the best accuracy with the original MS image. Therefore, in consideration of spatial and spectral characteristics of fused image, we found that PSGAN_RD is suitable for GK-2A products."

Note that these data may contain multiple types of anomalies (e.g., missing, minor, outlier, etc.) caused by harsh environment, sensor faults, transfer omission and other factors. These anomalies seriously affect the evaluation of structural performance. Therefore, the effective analysis and mining of SHM data is an extremely important task. Inspired by the deep learning paradigm, this study develops a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based data anomaly detection approach for SHM. The framework of the proposed approach includes three modules : (a) A three-channel input is established based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Gramian angular field (GAF) method; (b) A GANomaly is introduced and trained to extract features from normal samples alone for class-imbalanced problems; (c) Based on the output of GANomaly, a CNN is employed to distinguish the types of anomalies. In addition, a dataset-oriented method (i.e., multistage sampling) is adopted to obtain the optimal sampling ratios between all different samples. The proposed approach is tested with acceleration data from an SHM system of a long-span bridge. The results show that the proposed approach has a higher accuracy in detecting the multi-pattern anomalies of SHM data."

FPACK is defined as the teacher’s capability to design and implement geographic fieldwork effectively, combining geographic content, teaching and learning strategies, and geographic fieldwork. A teacher’s FPACK is a key prerequisite to introduce geographic fieldwork, or a signature pedagogy in geography, effectively into the classroom. This study focuses on a student-centered fieldwork and asked the participating pre-service teachers to design an inquiry-based fieldwork. As a result of analyzing the participants’ reflective journals through repeated content analysis, this study found that the pre-service teachers had opportunities to examine the meaning of geographic fieldwork, contemplate the nature of inquiry, and understand geographic concepts at a deep level. Furthermore, they combined these reflections meaningfully, and cultivated and expressed FPACK. The word cloud based on the text of reflective journals also supported the findings. This research merits inclusion to the literature because it is an innovative attempt to examine teacher expertise in the context of geographic fieldwork and analyze the impacts of an inquiry-based geographic fieldwork design project on FPACK empirically."

Various products that utilize AI are being developed in medicine and IBM’s Watson or Google’s deep learning based AI are representative examples. Since medical AI recognizes regular patterns by learning immense quantities of data, it is expected to affect medical branches associated with diagnostic tests the most.Especially the field of radiology that offers diagnosis from images like X-rays, ultrasound, and MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is considered to be the fastest in puttiing AI into practice and vast innovation of image is expected in terms of automatic shooting of images,radiologist readings, supporting examinations, efficiency of procedure, and impprovement in quality. Computer aided diagnosis(CAD)software and automated diagnostic solution which used AI technology are being certified as medical devices in United States and they shall be appliied widely in medical sites worldwide.In medical image diagnosis, inevitable misdiagnosis is unavoidable. Misdiagnosis is easy to occur when large amounts of images are provided due to group checkups and thus there are increasing demands for diagnostic aid from radiologists. However,if bad results should happen because of AI diagnosis, there are questions about who shall be legally responsible and such liability issues are potentially problematic in the near future.This paper considers these problems by categorizing AI_CAD in three types. The first type, the second reader CAD, enables the radiologist to use computer results as a ‘secondary opinion’. The second type is concurrent reader CAD in which the radiologist employs CAD results as references before deciphering. The third type, the first reader CAD, provides independent interpretation results and sorts the images to selects ones that need to be ascertained by a radiologist."
Animal Fur Recognition Algorithm Based on Feature Fusion Network,2022,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'Fur Image Recognition', 'Texture Features', 'Activation Function', 'Feature Fusion.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"China is a big country in animal fur industry. The total production and consumption of fur are increasing year by year. However, the recognition of fur in the fur production process still mainly relies on the visual identification of skilled workers, and the stability and consistency of products cannot be guaranteed. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a feature fusion-based animal fur recognition network on the basis of typical convolutional neural network structure, relying on rapidly developing deep learning techniques. This network superimposes texture feature - the most prominent feature of fur image - into the channel dimension of input image. The output feature map of the first layer convolution is inverted to obtain the inverted feature map and concat it into the original output feature map, then Leaky ReLU is used for activation, which makes full use of the texture information of fur image and the inverted feature information. Experimental results show that the algorithm improves the recognition accuracy by 9.08% on Fur_Recognition dataset and 6.41% on CIFAR-10 dataset. The algorithm in this paper can change the current situation that fur recognition relies on manual visual method to classify, and can lay foundation for improving the efficiency of fur production technology."
Differentiation among stability regimes of alumina-water nanofluids using smart classifiers,2022,"['alumina-water nanofluids', 'artificial intelligent classifiers', 'classification accuracy', 'multilayer perceptron', 'stability regime']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Nanofluids have recently triggered a substantial scientific interest as cooling media. However, their stability is challenging for successful engagement in industrial applications. Different factors, including temperature, nanoparticles and base fluids characteristics, pH, ultrasonic power and frequency, agitation time, and surfactant type and concentration, determine the nanofluid stability regime. Indeed, it is often too complicated and even impossible to accurately find the conditions resulting in a stabilized nanofluid. Furthermore, there are no empirical, semi-empirical, and even intelligent scenarios for anticipating the stability of nanofluids. Therefore, this study introduces a straightforward and reliable intelligent classifier for discriminating among the stability regimes of alumina-water nanofluids based on the Zeta potential margins. In this regard, various intelligent classifiers (i.e., deep learning and multilayer perceptron neural network, decision tree, GoogleNet, and multi-output least squares support vector regression) have been designed, and their classification accuracy was compared. This comparison approved that the multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) with the SoftMax activation function trained by the Bayesian regularization algorithm is the best classifier for the considered task. This intelligent classifier accurately detects the stability regimes of more than 90% of 345 different nanofluid samples. The overall classification accuracy and misclassification percent of 90.1% and 9.9% have been achieved by this model. This research is the first try toward anticipting the stability of water-alumin nanofluids from some easily measured independent variables."

In order to discuss the theory of Civil responsibility related to AI, research on legal personality of AI should be preceded. This study attempted to examine in what the civil responsibility directed to. To research of this, first of all, what AI is and how to define AI technology in the field of Civil law. And then the characteristic of AI technology were summarized. Due to the treat of AI, it has natural character of unpredictability that results can vary from user to user through Deep Learning while operating the input in Algorithm. A basic discussion on the legal personality of AI technology was introduced based on this characteristic.In the Legal Personality Positive theory, since AI products are unpredictable, there  is a real need for legal status to give responsibility for the occurrence of damages, and the legal personality is fundamentally a legislator’s decision. On the other hand, Negative theory on Legal Personality refutes the view of Positive theory and expresses that AI products are only tools uses by humans and cannot be the subjects of expression of intention. However, even if it is Negative side, the possibility of being a legal personality is left when it comes to have a recognition in the future. If High-performance available AI with the same level of human beings’ thought or emotion(mind), it can be permissible. Therefore, as a Third view, I summarized the view that the recognition of legal personality may be possible if the discussion on the community is based on the future technology stage rather that the current technology level.Finally, civil liability related to AI products was divided into negligence liability and no-fault liability. Future AI technology level, which is highly developed, will replace human labor and guarantee large profits for manufacturers, so there is a possibility that the discussion of legal personality related to AI technology can be extended from the current technology status."

However, the cases of application to the regulation sector of government are still insufficient. The Korea Institute of Nonproliferation and Control (KINAC) is studying to apply A.I. technology to the regulation to improve the objectivity, consistency, and efficiency of classification and export licensing review. The KINAC developed the Nation Nuclear Technology Information Collection and Analysis System using A.I. techniques such as machine learning and deep learning techniques. KINAC and FNC Technology are developing the Export Risk Assessment System using A.I. modules and Bayesian Networks. The KINAC and Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) are developing an inventory history management system subject to the Nuclear Cooperation Agreements. The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) and KINAC operate the Nuclear Import and Export Control System (NEPS) for application and export license review according to relevant laws such as the Foreign Trade Act. Therefore, preparing an integration plan for the existing NEPS and the new systems is necessary. Since the NEPS has to be operated and accessible at all times, so the stability of the NEPS is the most important when integration and linking. So, it is suggested that the Collection and Analysis System and the Risk Assessment System, which require a lot of data traffic, are configured in a server separate from the NEPS, and the new DB and the NEPS DB are only linked. An inventory history management system is also suggested to be integrated and configured into the NEPS. Third, it is recommended that each system lists the information provided to or received from the NEPS in advance, and one-way communication should be performed basically. Two-way communication should be performed when necessary. Finally, against various cyber accidents and information leakage, it is proposed to review security vulnerabilities and apply essential security measures and guidelines. Through the integration and linkage of these systems, it is expected that the objectivity, consistency, and efficiency of classification and export licensing review of the KINAC are strengthened, and national transparency of development, production, and use of nuclear material is enhanced. It can be satisfied with the increasingly strengthened demands of the international community on duty for strategic item management."

The Influence of Creator Information on Preference for Artificial Intelligence- and Human-generated Artworks,2022,"['Art', 'Ai', 'Creator', 'Context', 'Preference', 'Art Experience', 'Individual Difference']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: Researchers have shown that aesthetic judgments of artworks depend on contexts, such as the authenticity of an artwork (Newman & Bloom, 2011) and an artwork’s location of display (Kirk et al., 2009; Silveira et al., 2015). The present study aims to examine whether contextual information related to the creator, such as whether an artwork was created by a human or artificial intelligence (AI), influences viewers’ preference judgments of an artwork. Methods: Images of Impressionist landscape paintings were selected as human-made artworks. AI-made artwork stimuli were created using Google’s Deep Dream Generator by mimicking the Impressionist style via deep learning algorithms. Participants performed a preference rating task on each of the 108 artwork stimuli accompanied by one of the two creator labels. After this task, an art experience questionnaire (AEQ) was given to participants to examine whether individual differences in art experience influence their preference judgments. Results: Setting AEQ scores as a covariate in a two-way ANCOVA analysis, the stimuli with the human-made context were preferred over the stimuli with the AI-made context. Regarding the types of stimuli, the viewers preferred AI-made stimuli to human-made stimuli. There was no interaction effect between the two factors. Conclusion: These results suggest that preferences for visual artworks are influenced by the contextual information of the creator when the individual differences in art experience are controlled."
Data abnormal detection using bidirectional long-short neural network combined with artificial experience,2022,"['BiLSTM', 'data anomaly detection', 'feature extraction', 'long-span bridge', 'structural health monitoring']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Data anomalies seriously threaten the reliability of the bridge structural health monitoring system and may trigger system misjudgment. To overcome the above problem, an efficient and accurate data anomaly detection method is desiderated. Traditional anomaly detection methods extract various abnormal features as the key indicators to identify data anomalies. Then set thresholds artificially for various features to identify specific anomalies, which is the artificial experience method. However, limited by the poor generalization ability among sensors, this method often leads to high labor costs. Another approach to anomaly detection is a data-driven approach based on machine learning methods. Among these, the bidirectional long-short memory neural network (BiLSTM), as an effective classification method, excels at finding complex relationships in multivariate time series data. However, training unprocessed original signals often leads to low computation efficiency and poor convergence, for lacking appropriate feature selection. Therefore, this article combines the advantages of the two methods by proposing a deep learning method with manual experience statistical features fed into it. Experimental comparative studies illustrate that the BiLSTM model with appropriate feature input has an accuracy rate of over 87-94%. Meanwhile, this paper provides basic principles of data cleaning and discusses the typical features of various anomalies. Furthermore, the optimization strategies of the feature space selection based on artificial experience are also highlighted."

Air cavities were manually delineated on simulation CT and MR images in the treatment planning system for each patient. The synthetic CT images were generated using the deep learning model trained in a prior study. Two more plans with identical beam parameters were recalculated with ED maps that were either manually overridden by the cavities or derived from the synthetic CT. Dose calculation accuracy was explored in terms of dose-volume histogram parameters and gamma analysis. Results: The D<sub>95%</sub> averages were 48.80 Gy, 48.50 Gy, and 48.23 Gy for the original, manually assigned, and synthetic CT-based dose distributions, respectively. The greatest deviation was observed for one patient, whose D<sub>95%</sub> to synthetic CT was 1.84 Gy higher than the original plan. Conclusions: The variation of the air cavity position in the gastrointestinal area affects the treatment dose calculation. Synthetic CT-based ED modification would be a significant option for shortening the time-consuming process and improving MRgRT treatment accuracy."

An Enhanced Video Anomaly Detection System for Smart City Management,2022,"['video anomaly detection', 'video transmission', 'surveillance system', 'smart city']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Since the popularity of city monitoring systems has increased, surveillance videos have become more common. However, due to the massive increment of social event needs after lifting the coronavirus pandemic lockdown, the pressure of handling anomalies on government departments is growing with each passing day. In addition, surveillance cameras cannot record every corner of our city. There are still blind areas such as indoor environments and remote regions. Therefore, this paper introduces and develops an comprehensive system for video anomaly detection in smart city management, which is based on mobile phones, to enlarge the coverage of the current surveillance system. This system can capture and transmit abnormal videos. In addition, a deep learning method (VGG16) is implemented in the system to do video anomaly detection."
A Framework for Pedestrian Sub-Classification and Arrival Time Prediction at Signalized Intersection Using Preprocessed Lidar Data,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"The mortality rate for pedestrians using wheelchairs was 36% higher than the overall population pedestrian mortality rate. However, there is no data to clarify the pedestrians’ categories in both fatal and nonfatal accidents, since police reports often do not keep a record of whether a victim was using a wheelchair or has a disability. Currently, real-time detection of vulnerable road users using advanced traffic sensors installed at the infrastructure side has a great potential to significantly improve traffic safety at the intersection. In this research, we develop a systematic framework with a combination of machine learning and deep learning models to distinguish disabled people from normal walk pedestrians and predict the time needed to reach the next side of the intersection. The proposed framework shows high performance both at vulnerable user classification and arrival time prediction accuracy."
ArchShapesNet: a novel dataset for benchmarking architectural building information modeling element classification algorithms,2022,"['BIM (Building Information Modeling)', 'semantic enrichment', 'parametric augmentation', 'multi-view CNN']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recent studies in the domain of semantic enrichment have employed artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to distinguish and classify building information modeling (BIM) elements to check their conformance with open standard data formats. Training AI algorithms requires the development of well-balanced and robust datasets of BIM elements. However, collection is difficult as sources are limited to existing models and sample libraries. This study developed a parametric augmentation approach to create synthetic copies of BIM elements, and thus rapidly supplement manually collected samples. The approach was used to create ArchShapesNet, a dataset consisting of 11 common architectural elements with an equal size of 4,000 samples per class. Two multi-view convolutional neural networks (CNN), a geometric deep learning algorithm, were trained and tested separately on ArchShapesNet and an initial dataset with sample imbalances. Results showed significant improvement in the accuracy and F1 scores, providing evidence of the utility of ArchShapesNet. The size and scope of the dataset are considered to be the first of their kind and provide a benchmark for testing the semantic integrity of BIM models. The augmentation approach also provides a general framework to create custom datasets for different specialties in the Architectural Engineering and Construction industry."
Group Estimation for Social Robot Navigation in Crowded Environments,2022,"['Human group-aware', 'Social robot navigation', 'Crowded environments']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Socially acceptable navigation in a crowded environment is a challenging problem in robotics due to diverse and unknown human intent. Previous studies have dealt with the social navigation problem in dense crowds via multi-robot collision avoidance. However, it is intractable to follow social compliant trajectory since human-robot interaction differs from the multi-robot collision avoidance problem. To approach our goal, this work exploits a human behavior model and focuses on social group actions such as walking together. We observed that human recognizes the other human groups and avoids them during navigation while maintaining social distances. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a social robot navigation method under group space estimation of crowds on a deep reinforcement learning framework. The proposed method estimates the social groups of crowds based on the behavioral similarities in sensory information. Our reinforcement learning framework learns a socially compliant and effective navigation policy through the proposed human group-aware reward. Our experiment in a crowd simulation demonstrates that the proposed approach generates a human-friendly trajectory with improved navigation performance."

In this paper, we propose a method for estimating resistance performance of ship hull by simulation using a graph neural network. This method converts the 3D geometric information of the hull mesh and the physical quantity of the surface into a mathematical graph, and is implemented as a deep learning model that predicts the future simulation state from the input state. The method proposed in the resistance performance experiment of simple hull showed an average error of about 3.5 % throughout the simulation."

Yet, automated segmentation ofthe larynx has been receiving very little attention. Segmentation of organs is an essential step in cancer treatment-planning.Computed Tomography scans are routinely used to assess the extent of tumor spread in the Head and Neck as they arefast to acquire and tolerant to some movement.This paper reviews various automated detection and segmentation methods used for the larynx on Computed Tomographyimages. Image registration and deep learning approaches to segmenting the laryngeal anatomy are compared,highlighting their strengths and shortcomings. A list of available annotated laryngeal computed tomography datasets iscompiled for encouraging further research. Commercial software currently available for larynx contouring are briefed inour work.We conclude that the lack of standardisation on larynx boundaries and the complexity of the relatively small structuremakes automated segmentation of the larynx on computed tomography images a challenge. Reliable computer aided interventionin the contouring and segmentation process will help clinicians easily verify their findings and look for oversightin diagnosis. This review is useful for research that works with artificial intelligence in Head and Neck cancer, specificallythat deals with the segmentation of laryngeal anatomy."

We all need different types of information for our common routines as watching/reading the news, listening to the radio, and watching different types of videos. However, sometimes we could run into problems when a certain type of information is required. For example, someone is listening to the radio and wants to listen to jazz, and unfortunately, all the radio channels play pop music mixed with advertisements. The listener gets stuck with pop music and gives up searching for jazz. So, the above example can be solved with an automatic audio classification system. Deep Learning (DL) models could make human life easy by using audio classifications, but it is expensive and difficult to deploy such models at edge devices like nano BLE sense raspberry pi, because these models require huge computational power like graphics processing unit (G.P.U), to solve the problem, we proposed DL model. In our proposed work, we had gone for a low complexity model for Audio Event Detection (AED), we extracted Mel-spectrograms of dimension 128×431×1 from audio signals and applied normalization. A total of 3 data augmentation methods were applied as follows: frequency masking, time masking, and mixup. In addition, we designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with spatial dropout, batch normalization, and separable 2D inspired by VGGnet [1]. In addition, we reduced the model size by using model quantization of float16 to the trained model. Experiments were conducted on the updated dataset provided by the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Events and Scenes (DCASE) 2020 challenge.

In this paper, we use a method of modifying the MLP-Mixer model to mask the image at a certain ratio and to reconstruct the image by delivering compressed information of the masked image to the model. After constructing a model learned with normal data from the MVTec AD dataset, a reconstruction error was obtained by inputting normal and abnormal images, respectively, and anomaly detection was performed through this, As a result of the performance evaluation, it was found that the proposed method has superior anomaly detection performance compared to the existing method."

It is no exaggeration to say that education was based on the changes in the current society, which are completely different from the past in terms of experience and development in each field. In this way, education leads to changes in the times, but in the changed era, the content and method of education must also be changed. Literature education is no exception. In modern society, the boundaries of sub-disciplinary learning are broken down, and it is important to create new knowledge by linking learning, and thus the demand for convergent competency is increasing. In accordance with these demands, it is necessary to provide convergent education within literature education. <The Philosophy of Literature and Emotion> was first opened in the second semester of 2020 at K University in Chungcheongnam-do, and is a course based on the convergence of literature, philosophy, and psychology.Through the convergence between highly relevant and heterogeneous disciplines, it was finally intended to increase students’ understanding and interest in literature. In this lecture, the emotions of anxiety, anger, and hatred experienced in everyday life were learned from the perspective of philosophy and psychology, and the work was analyzed in depth based on the emotions of the characters in the work. In addition, the analysis results were shared with fellow learners and went through a question-and-answer process. In the results of collecting opinions on students’ lectures in the last lecture, it was confirmed that the convergence education of philosophy and psychology centered on literature, which was the goal of this lecture, was effective in expanding the scope of literature understanding. The liberal arts and literature education of universities is important in that it can voluntarily reach a deep understanding of literature based on the contents of literature education and make literature a daily life as an adult. I expect that students will develop an interest in literature through a convergence of literature, philosophy, and psychology and become lifelong readers who enjoy literature."

Even though the performance of recent inpainting methods has been significantly improved owing to the introduction of deep learning, unnatural results can be obtained when an input image has a large-scale missing region, contains a complex scene, or is a high-resolution image. In this study, we propose a super resolution-based two-stage image inpainting method, motivated by the point that inpainting performance in low-resolution images is better than in high-resolution images. In the first step, we convert a high-resolution image into a low-resolution image and then perform image inpainting, which results in the initial output image. In the next step, the initial output image becomes the final output image, with the same resolution as the original input image using the super resolution model. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the high-resolution Urban100 dataset. Furthermore, we analyzed the inpainting performance depending on the size of the missing region and demonstrated that the proposed method could generate satisfactory results in a free-form mask."

And in the process of discussing studies with alumni, he worked tirelessly to pass on what he had learned from his master. In addition, he expressed his pride in the origin of the study from Chu Hsi(朱熹) to Toegye, and based on this, he showed the will of learning to his alumni.Second, it is the expression of pung-ryu(風流) through boating and travel. After being taught by Toegye, Lee Deok-hong began full-fledged pungryu activity. In particular, the boating performed at Takyeongdam(濯纓潭) with Toegye was comparable to the boating at the Jeokbyeok(赤壁). In addition, he enjoyed the pung-ryu at Cheongryangsan(淸凉山) with his alumni or went to a nearby place. At this time, what was as important to him as the beautiful natural scenery was the existence of the person traveling together.Third, it is to overcome the regret of parting by writing a sino-Korean poetry at the time of parting. Lee Deok-hong wrote a Jeung-Byeoul-Si(贈別詩) to an alumni who was about to part, or delivered a Jeung-Si(贈別詩) to an alumni who was far away, expressing regret for the breakup. However, he expressed his expectations not only to expressed his regret, but also to hoped that alumni's orientation would not change, while expressing his anticipations for returning safely from their mission.Looking at the meaning of social intercourse in Lee Deok-hong's sino-Korean poetry, it can be said that he promoted scholastic unity based on respect for his teacher. In addition, his Pungryu activities were mainly conducted in the Yeongnam(嶺南) area, so naturally, he re-aware of the Yeongnam area's landscapes and paid attention to the Yeongnam ancient sages. And as shown in Lee Deok-hong’s farewell sino-Korean poetry, it was possible that he was able to promote academic and regional unity because the deep trust in alumni."

By combining with machine learning, the accuracy of pose estimation has been greatly improved. However, the image-based approach has a limitation in that it is difficult to estimate pose when part or whole of the body is occluded by obstacles or when the lighting is dark. Recently, studies have emerged to estimate a human pose using wireless signals, which have the advantage of penetrating obstacles without being affected by brightness. The previous stereotype was that two or more pairs of transceivers are required to estimate a specific location based on wireless signals. This paper shows that it is possible to estimate the human pose and to perform body segmentation by applying deep learning only with 1x1 ultra wide band signals collected by 1×1 transceiver. We also propose a method of replacing convolution neural networks and showing better performance through transformer models."

I examine the relationship between the fasting of forty days and baptismal catechesis in the early church tradition. It is witnessed that there has been two or more origins of the fasting of forty days: a pre-paschal fasting of forty days, and a post-epiphany fasting of forty days. The identifying the fasting of forty days with Jesus’ fasting of forty days in wilderness started after the Nicene council (A.D 325). To articulate the relationship between Lent and baptism, this paper presents “lenten catechesis” which performed in the fourth century of Jerusalem under bishop Cyril.In addition, this paper also introduces a Lenten prayer in the early church traditions; St. Ephrem the Syrian’s prayer. With this prayer we could also learn the ways of praying in the season of Lent; how and what we pray with a proper spirituality of Lent. Alexander Schmemann’s annotated translation is added for our understanding of the deep meaning of Ephrem’s lenten prayer. In conclusion, this paper suggests adjustable practices of Lenten season for today. For example, liturgical understanding of the Lenten color of purple is examined in terms of biblical evidences, historical witness, theological interpretation, and pastoral adaptability. By introducing some practices for a biblical meditation in Lent, this paper seeks to find an insightful way of harmonizing the deep meaning of Lent with our modern ways of life, in a proper way of cultural adjustment."

A keywords network for each age group was constructed by KH Coder. As a result, Japanese language proficiency, culture-related knowledge and skills, and teaching skills were the central objectives of these training sessions. The main objectives of the training 1) in the 1990s were to improve Japanese language skills, promote understanding of cultures, and experience teaching methods; 2) in the 2000s, to develop teachers' awareness through collaboration and reflection; 3) in the 2010s, to develop reflective practice skills; and 4) in the 2020s, to realize deep learning for teachers. A comparison of these results with the discourse about Japanese teacher education led to the inference that training activities for NNTs may have been influenced by the discourse of native speaker teacher education in Japan. In response, we propose the need for future teacher training that considers training system of NNT and their professional development challenges."

독일통일과 폭력 문제,2022,"['German reunification', 'nonviolence', '1989', 'East-German Revolution', 'Perestroika', 'Protestant Revolution', '독일통일', '동독혁명', '비폭력', '1989', '페레스트로이카', '개신교혁명']","이 논문은 독일통일 과정에서 일어난 ‘기적 속의 기적’, 즉 동독에서 비폭력 평화혁명이 성공한 배경과 원인을 추적하려는 시도이다. 어떻게 이런 ‘기적 속의 기적’이 가능했는가. ‘동서 냉전의 최전선’이라고 불리는 동독과 서독 두 적대적인 체제가 통일을 이루는 과정에서 총성 한방 울리지 않을 수 있었던 말인가. 40년을 지배해온 강고한 스탈린주의 정권이 붕괴하는데 어떻게 피 한 방울 흘리지 않을 수 있었단 말인가. 이 논문은 이 물음에 대한 답을 구하고자 하는 시도이다.동독에서 비폭력 혁명이 성공하고, 이것이 민주적 선거를 거쳐 독일통일로 이어지게 된 데에는 네 가지 요인이 작용했다. 첫째, 고르바초프의 페레스트로이카이다. 동유럽 국가들에 대한 무력 개입을 포기하고, 국민주권을 인정한 페레스트로이카가 없었다면 동독의 비폭력 혁명은 존재할 수 없었다. 둘째, 동독 사회주의통일당(SED)의 카오스이다. 동독의 집권당은 동독의 ‘가을 혁명’ 시기에 깊은 혼란에 빠졌으며, 이때 온건 개혁파가 스탈린주의 강경파를 제압하면서 시위에 대한 폭력적 진압을 저지할 수 있었다. 셋째는 동독 재야 시민운동의 이상주의이다. 동독혁명의 주역들이 반사회주의적 체제 전복자가 아니라, ‘현실사회주의’를 개혁하고자 하는 이상사회주의자들이었기 때문에 동독 정권은 폭력적 진압을 자제한 것이다. 넷째는 개신교의 평화주의이다. 동독 개신교회는 동독혁명의 산실이자 훈련장이었다. 교회에서 익힌 비폭력 평화주의의 저항문화가 거리의 시위를 주도하면서 시위자들은 폭력행위를 극도로 배제하고 ‘비폭력’ 원칙을 고수할 수 있었다.독일의 비폭력 평화통일은 오늘날 전쟁 위기가 고조되고 있는 한반도에 더욱 각별한 의미를 던지고 있다. 첫째, 국제정세의 변화에 능동적으로 대처해야만 한다는 것이다. 페레스트로이카의 새로운 시대정신을 빠르게 포착한 동독 시민들이 비폭력 평화통일의 문을 열었다는 사실에 주목해야 한다. 둘째, 베를린장벽 붕괴 이후 급속도로 빠른 통일이 가능했던 것은 동서독이 분단 시대에 쌓아놓은 신뢰가 있었기 때문이라는 것이다. 남북한도 보다 적극적으로 접근하고 교류함으로써 통일 한반도를 대비한 신뢰 쌓기에 진지한 노력을 기울여야 한다. 셋째, 동독혁명의 주역이 이상사회주의자와 진보적 개신교도였다는 사실에도 주목해야 한다. 분단 체제에서 살면서도 이데올로기적 편견에 사로잡히지 않은 자들이 평화로운 통일의 길을 열어낸다는 역사적 사실에서 배우는 바가 있어야 한다.","This paper attempts to trace the background and cause of the success of the ""miracle in a miracle"", the nonviolent peace revolution in East Germany, which took place during the German unification process. How could this 'miracle in a miracle' happen? How could the two everlasting hostile systems, called the ‘front lines of the East-West Cold War’, be unified without a single gunfire? How could not a drop of blood be shed when the strong Stalinist regime, which had ruled for 40 years, collapsed? This paper attempts to find a reasonable answer to these questions.Four factors contributed to the success of the nonviolent revolution in East Germany, which led to the reunification of Germany through democratic elections. The first ist Gorbachev's Perestroika. East Germany's nonviolent revolution could not exist without the Perestroika of Mikhail Gorbachev, who gave up armed intervention in Eastern European countries and recognized their national sovereignty. The second factor ist the chaos of the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands (SED) of East Germany. The East German ruling party was in deep turmoil during the ‘fall revolution’, when moderate reformers won the Stalinist wing, preventing violent suppression of the protests. The third is the idealism of the East German opposition civic movement. The East German regime refrained from violent suppression because the main streams of the East German revolution were not anti-socialist overthrowers, but idealistic socialists who wanted to reform the ‘realexistierende Sozialismus’. The fourth factor is Protestant pacifism. The Protestant Church in East Germany was the birthplace and training ground of the East German Revolution. As the church-learned culture of nonviolent pacifism led the street protests, protesters were able to exclude violent acts and adhere to the ‘nonviolent’ principle.Germany's peaceful reunification of nonviolence is giving more special meanings to the Korean Peninsula, where the war crisis is rapidly escalating today. First, it is necessary to actively cope with changes in the international situation. East German citizens quickly captured the spirit of Perestroika's new era and opened the door to nonviolent, peaceful unification. Second, rapid unification was possible after the fall of the Berlin Wall because of the trust that East and West Germany had built during the division period. The two Koreas should also make more serious efforts to build trust for the unified Korean Peninsula by approaching and interacting more actively. Third, the main players in the East German revolution were idealistic socialists and progressive Protestants. The historical fact indicates that those who live in a divided system but are not obsessed with ideological prejudices pave the way for peaceful unification."

In the case of eco-friendly electric vehicles, noises generated by the wind while driving is considered to be the main cause of vehicle noise. The most influential factor for wind noise is the vehicle exterior design. Previously, a vehicle-specific analysis model was constructed using computer-aided engineering to predict wind noises. However, the existing methods require an additional analysis according to changes in the exterior design, and it depends on the subjective opinions of experts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective model that predicts and analyzes wind noises through various exterior design images. In this study, we propose an explainable deep learning model that can predict internal noises by using the vehicles exterior design images. The proposed method can extract features and detect important areas of each design image through multi-convolutional neural networks and self-attention. The experimental results show that the proposed method accurately predicts wind noises while detecting the importance of each exterior design feature."

An Improved Attention-based Bidirectional LSTM Model for Cyanobacterial Bloom Prediction,2022,"['Attention mechanism', 'bidirectional LSTM model', 'convolutional neural network', 'cyanobacterial bloom prediction.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Cyanobacterial blooms are one of the most serious water pollution problems for freshwater lakes. The treatment of blooms requires a lot of material and financial resources, so an early accurate prediction of cyanobacterial blooms is a very important way to deal with the outbreak of them. But it is challenging to predict the cyanobacterial blooms due to the uncertainty and complexity of their growth process. To deal with this problem, an improved attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) model is proposed in this paper, to make multistep predictions of chlorophyll-a concentration, which is a recognized characterization of algae activity. Firstly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract data features and spatiotemporal correlation. Secondly, the bidirectional LSTM network (BiLSTM) is used to predict the concentration of chlorophyll-a based on the extracted features. Finally, the attention mechanism is used to calculate the weights for the characteristic factors that affect the chlorophyll-a concentration. At last, some experiments are carried out based on the real monitoring data of a platform in the Taihu Lake area. Compared with the prediction results of the other four state-of-the-art deep learning methods, the results show that the proposed method in this paper has the highest prediction accuracy."
Location Recognition of Indoor Firefighting Facilities based on RGB -D C amera and 3D L iDAR,2022,"['Spatial data', 'Object recognition', '3D LiDAR SLAM']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recently, as fires frequently occur in large buildings, digital twin (DT) technology that enables remote and real-time monitoring and control similar to the real world environment is being studied as a disaster response technology in buildings. In order to use DT technology, it is essential to collect the spatial data of actual building indoor environments and firefighting facilities. This study proposes an indoor spatial data collecting system that can generate the modeling data inside the building and location data of firefighting facilities using laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) and RGB-D cameras. First, point clouds from three-dimensional (3D) LiDAR and the FAST-LIO2 (Fast LiDAR-Inertial Odometry) algorithm are used to obtain odometry information in an indoor environment. The firefighting facilities located inside the building are detected using RGB images and the deep learning model Faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) with Inception V2 architecture trained using RGB images of four types of firefighting facilities: fire extinguishers, fire hydrants, exit signs, and fire detectors. When a firefighting facility is detected, the relative distance between the RGB-D camera and the firefighting facility is calculated through the depth image and intrinsic parameters of the RGB-D camera. Afterwards, odometry information obtained from FAST-LIO2 and the relative distance are combined to obtain the 3D location of the firefighting facility. Point clouds of the FAST-LIO2 algorithm are then converted into models of the building indoor environment. Through this method, spatial data of an actual building can be constructed and used with DT technology."

“徒劳”的挣扎:新诗初创期胡适诗歌考察 — 以最初发表的白话诗为中心,2022,"['Modern vernacular Chinese', 'HuShi’s early works', 'Vernacular Chinses poems', 'Traditional poems', 'The challenge of creating a new poetic style']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Hushi’s first published poems aimed at revolutionizing the traditional styles of poetic writings. It is said that when he was a graduate student at USA he had a big argument with his friends about how to modernize the Chinese language. Hushi insisted that Classical Chinese should be replaced by Vernacular Chinese but his friends disagreed. The main ground for this disagreement was that Vernacular Chinese is a language not well-suited for writing a poem. This left Hushi no choice but to create a poem using Vernacular Chinese with a view to proving his friends wrong and giving impetus to the revolutionary transition from Classical Chinese to Vernacular Chinese. He first attempted to write eight poems, which were later published by the magazine New Youth. It is to be admitted that Hushi’s poems were not poetic masterpieces especially by an aesthetic standard. For this reason or others, they have long fallen off the radar among Chinese literature scholars. But I do believe that there is something important to learn from Hushi’s early poetic works when viewed from a larger context that includes not only their aesthetic values but also their contributions to stylistic developments in modern Chinese poetry. So this paper aims at digging deep into Hushi’s early poetic works and evaluating them in light of his idiosyncratic project of creating new ways of writing poems. The upshot is that a careful examination of Hushi’s poems reveals that there is something important that has been neglected by the past research. I hold that Hushi’s poems made great contributions to opening a new chapter in the modern history of Chinese poetry but, unfortunately, those contributions are not fully appreciated so far by contemporary scholars."

We evaluated the performance of MALDI-TOF MS in identifying nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) using the ASTA MicroIDSys system (ASTA Inc., Suwon, Korea) with the MycoDB v1.95s and upgraded MycoDB v2.0-beta databases. We tested 124 NTM isolates collected from Ogawa medium at Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea, between January and April 2019. MicroIDSys scores were categorized into three groups: ≥140, reliable identification; 130–139, ambiguous identification; and <130, invalid identification. To validate the results, we used the reverse blot hybridization assay (Molecutech REBA MycoID, YD Diagnostics Corp., Korea). Initial analysis using MycoDB v1.95s resulted in 26.6% (33/124) reliable, 43.5% (54/124) ambiguous, and 29.8% (37/124) invalid identifications. Re-analysis using the upgraded MycoDB v2.0-beta database resulted in 94.4% (117/124) reliable, 4.0% (5/124) ambiguous, and 1.6% invalid (2/124) identifications. The percentage of reliable identifications that matched with the reference increased from 26.6% (33/124) with MycoDB v1.95s to 93.5% (116/124) with MycoDB v2.0-beta. The upgraded databases enable substantially improved NTM identification through deep learning in the inference algorithm and by considering more axes in the correlation analysis. MALDI-TOF MS using the upgraded database unambiguously identified most NTM species. Our study lays a foundation for applying MALDI-TOF MS for the simple and rapid identification of NTM isolated from solid media."

Therefore, present researches have emphasized the necessity to obtain estimations of satellite-based evapotranspiration and soil moisture with related development researches. In this study, we presented the research status in Korea by investigating the current trends and methodologies for evapotranspiration and soil moisture. As a result of examining the detailed methodologies, we have ascertained that, in general, evapotranspiration is estimated using Energy balance models, such as Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC). In addition, Penman-Monteith and Priestley-Taylor equations are also used to estimate evapotranspiration. In the case of soil moisture, in general, active (AMSR-E, AMSR2, MIRAS, and SMAP) and passive (ASCAT and SAR)sensors are used for estimation. In terms of statistics, deep learning, as well as linear regression equations and artificial neural networks, are used for estimating these parameters. There were a number of research cases in which various indices were calculated using satellite-based data and applied to the characterization of drought. In some cases, hydrological cycle factors of evapotranspiration and soil moisture were calculated based on the Land Surface Model (LSM). Through this process, by comparing, reviewing, and presenting major detailed methodologies, we intend to use these references in related research, and lay the foundation for the advancement of researches on the calculation of satellite-based hydrological cycle data in the future."

PE methods not only provide security during transmission of image data but can also enable privacy-preserving computations on them. However, the presence of color information in the cipher image makes the existing PE algorithms vulnerable to jigsaw puzzle attacks. Therefore, this paper presents an extension of block-based PE methods that utilizes different keys for each color component when changing orientation of a block and pixel values in a block. Thus, offers better encryption performance as the color distribution of the original is changed significantly and the keyspace is expanded. The analysis on Tecnick dataset shows that the proposed PE method preserves compression performance of the existing methods while improving their encryption efficiency. In addition, the main advantage of the proposed method is that of being compatible with a widely used JPEG image standard, which makes it suitable for different outsourced multimedia applications such as, privacy-preserving deep learning, cloud-based photo storage, and social networking services."

I want to be able to control who knows what about themselves. I don't want anyone to have access to their personal information at any time. However, recent advances in information and communication technology threaten privacy, reduce control over personal information, and open the possibility of various negative consequences as a result of access to personal information. In the late 20th century, a data protection system was established in response to an increase in the level of personal information processing. In the 21st century, the strength of the platform economy is beginning with the rise of big data and advanced information technology (e.g., in the form of deep learning), the rise of big tech companies, and the storage and processing of exabytes of data.Technical features are currently in place to collect, store and retrieve large amounts of data on phone calls, Internet searches, and electronic payments, and are routinely used by both government agencies and business actors. The large-scale use and spread of advanced digital technology for the rise, surveillance and control of China has raised concerns among many people. For companies, personal information about customers and prospects is now a key asset. The scope and purpose of the privacy-oriented business models of big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple are often referred to as ""monitoring capitalism."" This paper compares and examines legislative precedents and theories of the United States, Japan and other countries, focusing on the EU, and examines the issues of personal information protection accompanying the development of new information and communication technologies. A brief summary is as follows: Appropriate regulation and protection must be implemented while accurately recognizing the impact of new technologies on personal information and privacy.First, there is the problem of regulating the use of so-called cookies with regard to Internet privacy. It will be necessary to find a point of contact to achieve information sharing and sharing efficiency without over-infringement of individual privacy.Second, it is necessary to address the issue of privacy in the development of cloud computing in an internationally consistent manner.Third, there is the problem of protecting personal information through the utilization of big data. In particular, the extent to which individual privacy protection is permitted is a problem when using so-called predictive information. It is also necessary to come up with a concrete plan to ban the use of predictive information by case rather than a general plan to ban the use of predictive information.Fourth, with the development of the Internet of Things, the possibility of infringement of personal information is increasing. Utilization of location information using GPS is one of them. Generally, the acquisition and use of personal information using “reconfigurable technology” can be solved by informing individuals of such information.Fifth, the development of information and communication technology can bring about changes in the voting process. This is the so-called e-governance or e-government. Electronic democracy should be achieved by allowing voters to vote freely and secretly at any stage, and by preventing the sale and coercion of votes.Finally, the so-called surveillance capitalism, which is a reaction to the development of security systems using surveillance cameras, should be resolved. At least national surveillance of citizens should be strictly prohibited, and laws and systems should be established to inform the public of such surveillance facts and prevent personal privacy from being violated when using information."
LSTM을 이용한 한반도 근해 이상수온 예측모델,2022,"['Sea surface temperature', 'High water temperature', 'Low water temperature', 'Long short-term memory']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Sea surface temperature (SST) is a factor that greatly influences ocean circulation and ecosystems in the Earth system. As global warming causes changes in the SST near the Korean Peninsula, abnormal water temperature phenomena (high water temperature, low water temperature) occurs, causing continuous damage to the marine ecosystem and the fishery industry. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology to predict the SST near the Korean Peninsula and prevent damage by predicting abnormal water temperature phenomena. The study area was set near the Korean Peninsula, and ERA5 data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) was used to utilize SST data at the same time period. As a research method, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm specialized for time series data prediction among deep learning models was used in consideration of the time series characteristics of SST data. The prediction model predicts the SST near the Korean Peninsula after 1- to 7-days and predicts the high water temperature or low water temperature phenomenon. To evaluate the accuracy of SST prediction, Coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) indicators were used. The summer (JAS) 1-day prediction result of the prediction model, R<sup>2</sup>=0.996, RMSE=0.119℃, MAPE=0.352% and the winter (JFM) 1-day prediction result is R<sup>2</sup>=0.999, RMSE=0.063℃, MAPE=0.646%. Using the predicted SST, the accuracy of abnormal sea surface temperature prediction was evaluated with an F1 Score (F1 Score=0.98 for high water temperature prediction in summer (2021/08/05), F1 Score=1.0 for low water temperature prediction in winter (2021/02/19)). As the prediction period increased, the prediction model showed a tendency to underestimate the SST, which also reduced the accuracy of the abnormal water temperature prediction. Therefore, it is judged that it is necessary to analyze the cause of underestimation of the predictive model in the future and study to improve the prediction accuracy."

You can see how they tried to interpret and reorganize Buddhism in the new era of ‘modern’.The third Buddha's work emphasizes the importance of Bodhisattva by placing the original source, wisdom, and mercy of Bodhisattva in the field of the Buddha's original source, wisdom, and mercy, respectively.It can be confirmed that the idea of Bodhisattva is deeply embedded in the root of Manhae's practicality, and the process of planning and editing The Great Texts of Buddhism itself is a religious practice of patience and shows the practical intelligence of Manhae by performing Bodhisattva.Manhae sublimated the spiritual spirit of the righteous and virtuous, which he had deep in his heart as a child, into the power of the Mahayana Bodhisattva, and the Buddha-nature theory of the Buddha-nature of all living beings is freedom and equality. By securing a place in the modern ideological system of Manhae, he built a world of practical intelligence.Compilation of The Great Texts of Buddhism is an example of trying to overcome the problems of the time in both tradition and modernity.Manhae's intellect can be evaluated as being wen-gu-zhi-xin(溫故知新). By learning the merits of Confucianism, which is the old one, creatively inheriting the new modernity by putting it off, he tried to respond to the demands of the times through Buddhist reinterpretation. In other words, The Great Texts of Buddhism, which reflects the practicality of bodhisattvas and the intellect of wen-gu-zhi-xin(溫故知新), can be said to be a joint product of the unity of knowledge and action.Manhae tried to reinterpret his religious belief, Buddhism's ideal, in a turbulent era where tradition and modernity intersect, to find a concrete solution to the problem at hand and to realize it in the field of history through practical actions. This practical intelligence of Manhae can be said to be a valuable legacy that is more desperately requested in this era when life and knowledge are divided and fragmented.The biggest reason Manhae is still being talked about today is probably because of his courageous practical ability and consistent attitude to life in harmony with her own intellectual abilities to make history on this earth without isolating her intellectual knowledge in the metaphysical and ranscendental world. He can be said to be a representative figure in the modern Korean intellectual world, who personally practiced equality and a savior-like life through an Unconstrained Conduct based on universal intellect, going beyond religion and ethnicity."

MVI는 주로 영상학적 이미지를 보고 진단하는데, 숙련된 의사조차도 탐지하기 어렵고 의사마다 진단 결과가 다를 때도 있다. 이에 딥러닝 모델을 활용해 MVI를 효과적으로 탐지하는 방법들이 개발되었다. 그러나 기존에 제안된 모델들은 적은 데이터에서 인공지능이 자동으로 추출한 특징에만 의존하는 한계점이 존재한다. 본 연구자들은 실제 임상에서 쓰이는 4가지 특징을 직접 추출해 데이터셋 한계의 극복을 꾀하였다. 그 결과 완성된 새로운 모델은 최대 0.65의 F1 score를 달성했다. 그러나 데이터 전처리 과정에서의 손실, 의료영상에 특화된 사전학습 모델의 부재로 인한 한계를 체감했고, 향후 연구에선 특화된 사전학습 모델 개발과 준지도학습(SSL) 도입을 통해 극복할 것이다.","Microvascular invasion (MVI) is one of the most significant prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially for survival and recurrence. Thus, detecting MVI is a crucial task in cancer treatment. MVI detection, which mainly requires medical images, is a challenging task for even specialists, and the result is sometimes disputable. Deep learning models for MVI detection have been proposed to solve this issue. However, previous models depend on only the auto-generated features with small datasets. In this study, we manually extracted four pre-defined features to overcome the limitation. As a result, our final model achieved a 0.65 F1 score. We recognized the limitations of the loss in the data preprocessing process and the absence of a pre-trained model specialized in medical images. Therefore, in future studies, we will improve the model performance by using self-supervised learning (SSL) and a new pre-trained model specialized to medical images."

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find the most suitable activation function for super-resolution by applying the activation functions ReLU, ELU, and Swish and compare the quality of the output image for the same input images. The CelebaA Dataset was used as the dataset. Images were cut into a square during the pre-processing process then the image quality was lowered.

Some operate measuring instrument to obtain an accurate UVI, but it would be costly and inconvenient. Studies which assumed the UVI through environmental factors such as solar radiation and amount of cloud have been introduced, but those studies also could not provide service to individual. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning model to calculate UVI using solar object information and sunlight characteristics to provide an accurate UVI at individual location. After selecting the factors, which were considered as highly correlated with UVI such as location and size and illuminance of sun and which were obtained through the analysis of sky images and solar characteristics data, a data set for DNN model was constructed. A DNN model that calculates the UVI was finally realized by entering the solar object information and sunlight characteristics extracted through Mask R-CNN.

Among the literary text, the focus also gradually changed from novels to essays with the absence of novels. Moreover, Non-literary texts added various genres such as columns, news, notes, lectures, and congratulatory speeches besides the major expository texts and argument essays. Furthermore, the most common topics were about specialized fields, especially those thought-provoking essays about social and cultural events. Considering the cultivation goals of Korean-major students in Chinese universities and the textbook learning goals, the purpose of integrated Korean textbooks for advanced learners is not to pass language tests and get high-level certifications but to acquire difficult language expression, in-depth cultural knowledge, and to establish universal values through the knowledge of Korean studies for students. Therefore, When selecting a text genre or topic, it is not appropriate to select those expressions that are even easier than poetry and essays without deep thought. The results of this research indicate thae the proportion of literary text should be increased and the non-literary texts should be decreased in the compiling of advanced integrated Korean textbooks. In literary texts, novels should be mainly composed, followed by essays, and in non-literary genres should be composed mainly of expository texts and argument essays."
Sidewalk Gaseous Pollutants Estimation Through UAV Video-based Model,2022,"['Vehicle Emission', 'MOVES', 'Vehicle Detection', 'UAV', 'Gaussian plume']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology grew in popularity over the years, it was introduced for air quality monitoring. This can easily be used to estimate the sidewalk emission concentration by calculating road traffic emission factors of different vehicle types. These calculations require a simulation of the spread of pollutants from one or more sources given for estimation. For this purpose, a Gaussian plume dispersion model was developed based on the US EPA Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES), which provides an accurate estimate of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions from vehicles under a wide range of user-defined conditions. This paper describes a methodology for estimating emission concentration on the sidewalk emitted by different types of vehicles. This line source considers vehicle parameters, wind speed and direction, and pollutant concentration using a UAV equipped with a monocular camera. All were sampled over an hourly interval. In this article, the YOLOv5 deep learning model is developed, vehicle tracking is used through Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking), vehicle localization using a homography transformation matrix to locate each vehicle and calculate the parameters of speed and acceleration, and ultimately a Gaussian plume dispersion model was developed to estimate the CO, NOx concentrations at a sidewalk point. The results demonstrate that these estimated pollutants values are good to give a fast and reasonable indication for any near road receptor point using a cheap UAV without installing air monitoring stations along the road."
Development and Validation of the Radiology Common Data Model (R-CDM) for the International Standardization of Medical Imaging Data,2022,"['Metadata', 'standardization', 'radiology information system']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), a standard file format for medical imaging data, contains metadata describing each file. However, metadata are often incomplete, and there is no standardized format for recording metadata, leading to inefficiency during the metadata-based data retrieval process. Here, we propose a novel standardization method for DICOM metadata termed the Radiology Common Data Model (R-CDM).Materials and Methods: R-CDM was designed to be compatible with Health Level Seven International (HL7)/Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and linked with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM to achieve a seamless link between clinical data and medical imaging data. The terminology system was standardized using the RadLex playbook, a comprehensive lexicon of radiology. As a proof of concept, the R-CDM conversion process was conducted with 41.7 TB of data from the Ajou University Hospital. The R-CDM database visualizer was developed to visualize the main characteristics of the R-CDM database.Results: Information from 2801360 cases and 87203226 DICOM files was organized into two tables constituting the R-CDM. Information on imaging device and image resolution was recorded with more than 99.9% accuracy. Furthermore, OMOP-CDM and RCDM were linked to efficiently extract specific types of images from specific patient cohorts.Conclusion: R-CDM standardizes the structure and terminology for recording medical imaging data to eliminate incomplete and unstandardized information.

There are more than ten surviving examples of such wooden altarpieces currently known. Among them, the Wooden Altarpiece with Amitabha Buddha preaching at Yongmunsa Temple in Yecheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do Province created by the monk-sculptor Daneung (端應) in 1684 carries a large volume of symbolic elements. Thus, it provides an informative example for understanding wooden altarpieces with Buddha preaching produced during the late Joseon Dynasty. This paper examines the religious and ideological meanings of various symbolic elements found in the Yongmunsa altarpiece.Daneung, the creator of the Wooden Altarpiece with Amitabha Buddha preaching at Yongmunsa Temple, was described as a “sudaeseonsa” (首大禪師, a great head Seon master) in the record on the production of the Buddha sculpture in 1692 at Bonghwangsa Temple in Andong, Gyeongsangbuk-do Province. He also assumed the role of a jeungmyeong (證明, a monk who ensures that a Buddhist project corresponds to doctrine) for another project undertaken in 1694 at Bonghwangsa Temple. Accordingly, Daneung is believed to have possessed a deep understanding of Buddhist doctrine and broad knowledge in the field.The symbolic Buddhist elements found in the Wooden Altarpiece with Amitabha Buddha preaching at Yongmunsa Temple can be largely divided between elements of Pure Land Buddhism and Seon (Chan) Buddhism. The Pure Land elements are presented literally through the iconography of nine grades of rebirth depicted in the lower section of the altarpiece and the phrases engraved on the left and right edges of the frame. The term “myeongsim” (明 心, luminous mind or illuminating the mind) carved into the center of the bottom edge of the frame is highly emblematic in Seon Buddhism. It implies a key Seon belief that the discovery of the Buddha nature inherent within everyone is in itself enlightenment. The inclusion of elements from both Pure Land and Seon Buddhism into the Yongmunsa altarpiece corresponds to the Seon meditation yeombulseon (念佛禪) practice of reciting the Buddha’s name verbally, which was popular in the Buddhist community during the late Joseon Dynasty.Another distinctive characteristic of the Wooden Altarpiece with Amitabha Buddha preaching at Yongmunsa Temple is the manifestation of temporal and spatial concepts through hexagrams (卦) from Zhouyi (周易, the Book of Changes), a major Confucian scripture epitomizing the philosophy’s thought.The borders of the mandorla for the main Amitabha Buddha in the center of the Yongmunsa altarpiece are engraved with the eight trigrams (soseonggwae) to indicate spatial directions. Twelve among the sixty-four hexagrams (daeseonggwae) are engraved on the four edges of the frame of the Yongmunsa altarpiece to show a perception of time. These hexagrams are the twelve sosikgwae or byeokgwae (waning and waxing hexagrams) that describe the passage and circulation of time through extinction and growth of yin and yang energy. By applying these sosikgwae hexagrams, the Yongmunsa altarpiece formed an autonomous but complete temporal system.The Joseon Dynasty embraced Neo-Confucianism as its ruling ideology and suppressed Buddhism, so monks responded by demonstrating the harmony and accord possible between Buddhism and Confucianism as a measure to cope with this shift in the dominant ideology. They tried to better communicate with Confucianists by familiarizing themselves with Neo-Confucian learning, including the Book of Changes. Moreover, they drew upon the theory of hexagram images from the Book of Changes in order to justify the production of Buddhist images. However, they did not embrace Confucian elements unconditionally. It is noteworthy that monks added their own iterati..."

The subway is a means of transportation used by an average of 10 million people a day, and although it is important to create a clean and comfortable environment, the level of particulate matter pollution is shown to be high. It is because the subways run through an underground tunnel and the particulate matter trapped in the tunnel moves to the underground station due to the train wind. The Ministry of Environment and the Seoul Metropolitan Government are making various efforts to reduce PM concentration by establishing measures to improve air quality at underground stations. The smart air quality management system is a system that manages air quality in advance by collecting air quality data, analyzing and predicting the PM concentration. The prediction model of the PM concentration is an important component of this system. Various studies on time series data prediction are being conducted, but in relation to the PM prediction in subway stations, it is limited to statistical or recurrent neural network-based deep learning model researches. Therefore, in this study, we propose four transformer-based models including spatiotemporal transformers. As a result of performing PM concentration prediction experiments in the waiting rooms of subway stations in Seoul, it was confirmed that the performance of the transformer-based models was superior to that of the existing ARIMA, LSTM, and Seq2Seq models. Among the transformer-based models, the performance of the spatiotemporal transformers was the best. The smart air quality management system operated through data-based prediction becomes more effective and energy efficient as the accuracy of PM prediction improves. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the efficient operation of the smart air quality management system."

To this end, first, this study conceptually explains what is new ‘associated milieu’ in which human- technology-media are combined. Second, in this process, we connect the associated milieu with the change in the ‘governmental rationality’ of our age we live in. The emergence of a new governance system is to replace the old process of disciplinary subjectivation with a core driving mechanism for the ‘automated’ social relationship of subjects through technology-based automated calculation and valuation. In this study, we link these issues with aspects of the major changes that occurred in the post-2020 pandemic moment. And it was confirmed that the pandemic was an important moment to accelerate these changes, and to make them ‘natural’ premise.

CNN-based fire detection method on autonomous ships using composite channels composed of RGB and IR data,2022,"['Autonomous ship Fire safety', 'Fire detection', 'RGB-IR', 'CNN', 'Composite channel data']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Since fires grow exponentially after an outbreak, it is crucial to extinguish them quickly. In the case of fires occurring on commercial ships and naval vessels, smoke and heat in the narrow enclosed compartments of the ships make it difficult to extinguish fires, threatening human safety, and causing massive property damage. So-called autonomous ships are operated without crew members in charge of fire suppression. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the performance and reliability of the automatic fire detection and suppression system. However, the standard fire detection system installed on ships is not adequate for the level of fire risk. Existing fire detection methods still have false alarm problems, and it takes a long time for heat and smoke from the fire to reach the detector. In this study, the use of combined channel data (RGB-IR) is proposed as an image-based fire detection method applicable to ships. In nature, many animals obtain multiple wavelength information, which is advantageous for hunting or risk preparedness in a wild environment. In this way, it is assumed that both the characteristics of RGB data in the visible area and IR data in the infrared area may be utilized through the combined channel data. A fire detection model with composite channel data input was built using deep learning with a Convolution Neural Network (CNN), a fire detection model using composite channel data input was constructed, and hyper-parameters were tuned during the training process to determine the optimal model and compare it with the existing RGB and IR models, respectively. Compared with the model using only conventional RGB or IR data, the fire detection accuracy of the model using RGB-IR combined channel data increased and the false detection rate decreased."

In 1812, Lee Ki-kyung, Kang Se-ryun, and Yuk-sunsisa(六巡詩社) were written and devoted to literature.The characteristics of his early poems are: First, there are many Dongmong(童蒙) poems and Chinese poems written in his teens, and the contents reveal a very mature spiritual world. The poem ｢Geumgak(琴客)｣, a poem written at the age of 9, ｢Dangusashi Gyeongseo a poem(丹丘四時景序詩)｣ at the age of 12, and ｢Yahohaeng(夜虎行)｣ a 13-year-old poem, stand out the most. Second, Giseok(紀俗) poetry, which records childhood experiences, stands out. ｢Sangwontajo(上元打鳥)｣ written at the age of 14, described experiences as a Daeboreum[the day of the first full moon of the year] custom related to bird chase in Gangwon-do. His poetry is the crystallization of his hard work and deep contemplation for learning in Dangu. The hometown of Dangu was Hong Soon-ho's hometown, the origin of Taoism, and the origin of literary creation.To investigate the life and friendship of Hong Soon-ho and to study his literary world is essential for the study of the literary relationship with the Namin literary group, the Pungsan-Hong family and writers centered in the Wonju area."

On the other hand, in automated financial transactions using technology, errors that occur in the process of minimizing human intervention or without human intervention combine with the speed and mass of transactions to cause large-scale accidents. As such, along with the convenience of technology, the risks associated with it cannot be overlooked. Algorithmic trading using an automated system is being introduced and used by general investors, and the robo-advisor introduced around 2017 promotes and promotes “customized” investment advice and management services. As advertising takes place, the need for protection for investors is growing.From the point of view of investors using automated investment tools, there is a big difference in investor protection depending on whether the service provider is an investment advisory business entity, a investment discretionary business entity, or a quasi-investment advisory business entity. Not only investors but also service providers need to know exactly which ‘business’ the service they want to provide falls into in order to meet the entry requirements. In particular, as the damage caused by illegal and illegal business of quasi-investment advisors increases and the voices for tightening regulations increase, it seems that a legislative solution as well as an interpretative approach is necessary.As artificial intelligence technologies such as algorithms, machine learning and deep learning develop, they are exposed to the risk of becoming a black box, and even experts cannot properly explain automated investment means due to lack of understanding. It is inevitably passed on to investors. In addition, when the development of technology exceeds a certain stage, it is necessary to prepare for this because there is a possibility that such technology may not be properly regulated even if such technology is abused to cause unfair trade practices under the Capital Market Act.Research and contemplation to find a balance between the two should be carried out continuously to prepare for risks without hindering the development of technology, and ‘human’ should be at the center of it."
Analysis of Rice Blast Outbreaks in Korea through Text Mining,2022,"['Korea', 'Magnaporthe oryzae', 'Outbreak', 'Rice blast', 'Text mining']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Rice blast is a major plant disease that occurs worldwide and significantly reduces rice yields. Rice blast disease occurs periodically in Korea, causing significant socio-economic damage due to the unique status of rice as a major staple crop. A disease outbreak prediction system is required for preventing rice blast disease. Epidemiological investigations of disease outbreaks can aid in decision-making for plant disease management. Currently, plant disease prediction and epidemiological investigations are mainly based on quantitatively measurable, structured data such as crop growth and damage, weather, and other environmental factors. On the other hand, text data related to the occurrence of plant diseases are accumulated along with the structured data. However, epidemiological investigations using these unstructured data have not been conducted. The useful information extracted using unstructured data can be used for more effective plant disease management. This study analyzed news articles related to the rice blast disease through text mining to investigate the years and provinces where rice blast disease occurred most in Korea. Moreover, the average temperature, total precipitation, sunshine hours, and supplied rice varieties in the regions were also analyzed. Through these data, it was estimated that the primary causes of the nationwide outbreak in 2020 and the major outbreak in Jeonbuk region in 2021 were meteorological factors. These results obtained through text mining can be combined with deep learning technology to be used as a tool to investigate the epidemiology of rice blast disease in the future."

COVID-19 상황에서 학교와 교사가 경험한 교육실천 사례를 분석한 10편의 질적 연구물을 바탕으로 질적 메타분석을 실시하였으며, 주요 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, 포스트 코로나 시대에 학교교육 활동의 지속을 위해 학교와 교사는 학생 주도성과 교사 교육과정을 추구하는 과정에서 학생의 삶을 보다 더 깊이 이해하는데 집중해야 한다. 둘째, 학교조직은 업무구조의 유연성과 학년 중심의 의사결정 문화가 확보된 학교 안의 작은 학교 시스템으로의 전환이 요구된다. 셋째, 학생 돌봄과 학습권 보장이라는 교육 본질의 목적을 구현하기 위해 학교와 가정 지역사회 간 단단한 교육적 결합을 구축해야 한다. 이러한 연구 결과를 바탕으로 실천적 차원의 정책 제언으로 학생 상담 강화 및 학생 생활기록의 정상화, 학년 전환기의 전년도 교사(학교)와 당해연도 교사(학교)의 협력 체계 마련, 부서 및 학년 부장의 역할 재구조화, (가칭) 주치교사제(마을교사 가정방문 학생돌봄시스템) 등을 제안하였다.","The purpose of this study is to explore the school restructuring based on the teacher's experience following COVID-19. Based on a qualitative meta-synthesis, the results of the analysis of 10 qualitative studies that analyzed the cases experienced by schools and teachers in the COVID-19 situation showed that 'a deep understanding of student life', 'a small school system within a school', ' A solid educational connection between school-home-local community was sought in the school restructuring. First, in order for school educational activities to continue in an educational crisis situation, understanding of student life and learning should be prioritized. In addition, the school organization is required to change to a small school system within the school where the flexibility of the work structure and the grade-oriented decision-making culture are secured. Finally, in order to realize the purpose of education, which is to take care of students and guarantee the right to learn, a strong educational bond between the school and the home and local community should be established. Based on the above results, reinforce student counseling and normalize student life records with policy suggestions in the practice area, prepare a cooperative system between the previous year's teachers and the current year's teachers during the transition period, and restructure the roles of department and grade heads teacher, (tentative name)the primary care school teacher system was proposed."
컨테이너 터미널 내 반출입 차량 대기시간 예측에 관한 연구,2022,[],"물동량의 증가로 인해 컨테이너 터미널의 혼잡도가 높아지고 있고 이에 따른 장치장 및 게이트에서의 반출입 차량의 대기시간이 큰 폭으로 길어지고 있어 차량 운용 및 항만 운영 비효율이 극심한 상태이다. 이러한 문제 해결을 위해 부산항의 경우, 항만 공사 및 터미널 측에서 반출입 차량 예약시스템(VBS), 터미널 차량 혼잡도 정보, 예상 작업 처리 시간 정보 등을 서비스하고 있지만 실제 대기시간과 상이한 경우가 있어 가시적인 효과는 여전히 미흡한 실정이다. 따라서 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위한 기초자료로써 본 연구에서는 부산 신항의 컨테이너반출입 정보를 활용하여 딥러닝 기반의 반출입 차량 평균 대기시간 예측 모형을 제시하였다. 실제 평균 대기시간과의 비교를 통해 예측률을 검증한 결과 제시한 예측 모형이 높은 예측률을 보이는 것을 확인하였다.","Due to the increase in container cargo volume, the congestion of container terminals is increasing and the waiting time of gate in-out trucks has significantly lengthened at container yards and gates, resulting in severe inefficiency in gate in-out truck operations as well as port operations. To resolve this problem, the Busan Port Authority and terminal operator provide services such VBS, terminal congestion information, and expected operation processing time information. However, the visible effect remains insufficient, as it may differ from actual waiting time.. Thus, as basic data to resolve this problem, this study presents deep learning based average gate in-out truck waiting time prediction models, using container gate in-out information at Busan New Port. As a result of verifying the predictive rate through comparison with the actual average waiting time, it was confirmed that the proposed predictive models showed high predictive rate."
GAN 오버샘플링 기법과 CNN-BLSTM 결합 모델을 이용한 부정맥 분류,2022,[],"부정맥이란 심장이 불규칙한 리듬이나 비정상적인 심박동수를 갖는 것을 말하며, 뇌졸중, 심정지 등을 유발하거나 사망에도 이를 수 있는 만큼, 조기 진단과 관리가 무엇보다 중요하다. 본 연구에서는 심전도 신호의 QRS 특징 추출에 적합한 CNN과 기존 LSTM의 직전 패턴의 수렴 한계를 해결할 수 있는 BLSTM을 연결한 CNN-BLSTM 결합 모델을 이용한 부정맥 분류 방법을 제안한다. 이를 위해 먼저 전처리 과정을 통해 잡음을 제거한 심전도 신호에서 QRS 특징점을 검출하고 단일 비트 세그먼트를 추출하였다. 이때 데이터의 불균형 문제를 해결하기 위해 GAN 오버샘플링 기법을 적용하였다. 이 후 합성곱 계층을 통해 부정맥 신호의 패턴을 정밀하게 추출하도록 구성하고 이를 BLSTM의 입력으로 사용한 후 매개변수를 학습시키고 검증 데이터로 학습 모델을 평가한 후 부정맥 분류의 정확도를 확인하였다. 제안한 방법의 우수성을 입증하기 위해 MIT-BIH 부정맥 데이터베이스를 이용하여 분류의 정확도, 정밀도, 재현율, F1-score를 비교하였다. 성능평가 결과 각각 99.30%, 98.70%, 97.50%, 98.06%로 우수한 분류율을 나타내는 것을 확인할 수 있었다.","Arrhythmia is a condition in which the heart has an irregular rhythm or abnormal heart rate, early diagnosis and management is very important because it can cause stroke, cardiac arrest, or even death. In this paper, we propose arrhythmia classification using hybrid combination model of CNN-BLSTM. For this purpose, the QRS features are detected from noise removed signal through pre-processing and a single bit segment was extracted. In this case, the GAN oversampling technique is applied to solve the data imbalance problem. It consisted of CNN layers to extract the patterns of the arrhythmia precisely, used them as the input of the BLSTM. The weights were learned through deep learning and the learning model was evaluated by the validation data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were compared by using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The achieved scores indicate 99.30%, 98.70%, 97.50%, 98.06% in terms of the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, respectively."
Prediction for Platinum Resistance of Chemotherapy in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer patients based on Magnetic Resonance Images,2022,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: To investigate a preoperative multi-sequence MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and clinical factors for prediction of platinum-based chemotherapy sensitivity in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).Methods: The complete data of 168 patients with EOC confirmed by surgery and pathology in Seoul St. Marys Hospital was retrospectively analyzed. Only patients underwent pre-treatment MRI examination were included this study. All patients underwent platinum-based chemotherapy after cytoreductive surgery. The values of total ovarian cyst area with diameter, area for solid fraction, area ratio of solid to total cyst, peritoneal dissemination grade, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of solid fraction were evaluated on MRI images by a gynecologist and a radiologist, respectively. Clinical factors also were also analyzed to find predictor of platinum-based chemotherapy sensitivity.Results: Total 168 patients were included 97 high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients and 71 non-HGSOC patients. Sensitive group was included 96 patients who responded 1st adjuvant chemotherapy and the others (n=50) who recurred in platinum sensitive state. Resistance group was included refractory patients (n=14) and 8 patients who were changed from sensitive to resistance group. Among two groups, the ratio of solid portion to total cyst, peritoneal seeding, initial CA 125 etc. were noted significant meaning in univariate analysis. In ROC curve of prediction for platinum resistance, CA 125 and the ratio of solid to total area were noted 0.758, 0.687, each. When applying the machine learning algorithm, the deep learning algorithm showed the highest AUC value (0.814). In Cox regression, the HR significantly increased as the area of the solid portion increased (HR: 1.033, p=0.014).Conclusion: Initial CA 125 and the area ratio for solid portion to total cyst are meaningful factors to predict response of platinum-based chemotherapy in EOC."

The starting point was looking at how existing dichotomy influences our understanding of Soma and limits our knowledge of dance. The main method used for this study was literature review and Practice Based Research(PBR). The results of the study are as follows. Firstly, Soma is not a sub-concept of the mind, it is not passive. The researcher considered Soma to be a holistic subject that permeates intelligence, emotion, spirituality and continuity. Secondly, we must break free from trying to consciously reproduce what we think dance is. Through the process of dance, we must empty ourselves of emotions, thoughts, desires etc to be able to solely focus on the dancer's Soma and the viewer's Soma. Through belief in one's Soma and life, Soma's becomes one in subjectivity and creativity and thus the body's movement becomes a way for creative life. Finally, in dance making, the priority is the concept of time and space. For this, we explored communication with the earth and vitality creation. In this sense, the dancing Soma can bring about cosmic enlightenment at the same time as the emergence of vitality. If this process takes place, you will learn to love others by looking back on your life in dance making and dancing. Dance, through efficient movement, is a path to reach sincere emotions, deep sentiments and energetic vitality. If dance can understand the providence of the universe, heal mankind, and help gain enlightenment, it would not be an exaggeration to say that dance has the power to save humanity. As holistic beings, our understanding of Soma, dancing and dance helps our appreciation of both the ""here and now"" and vitality. I hope this study will be a small reference in terms of expanding understanding of Soma and dance."

For the rehabilitation and independence of people with developmental disabilities, it is emphasized that through various interventions, the deficiencies of cognitive, physical, and emotional development should be supplemented and educational activities that can nurture daily life skills are provided. The development and utilization of various programs for the establishment of a care system tailored to children with disabilities is insufficient.One of the negative influences on the quality of life of adults with developmental disabilities is overweight and obesity with the physical balance broken. This is closely related to their eating attitude, and their conscious and unconscious ideas about food also affect their eating attitude. Therefore, in order to cure their overweight and obesity and to improve their quality of life, a systematic and individually appropriate education program that fully considers these factors is needed. However, nutrition education for the disabled is only an education to reduce overeating and to eat evenly, but there is no educational program to correct the fundamental eating attitude.In order to recognize and correct wrong attitudes about eating, it is urgently necessary to develop a deep and sustainable educational program for correcting overall eating attitudes as well as simple nutrition education.Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate whether wrong eating attitudes can be changed through mindfulness-based nutrition education by composing adult developmentally disabled adults as an experimental group and a control group.In this study, conducted for 30 weeks, the weight loss of subjects who performed mindfulness-based nutrition education rather than general nutrition education was significantly lowered. It was confirmed that nutrition education based on mindfulness rather than general nutrition education can induce beneficial results for the health of adults with developmental disabilities.Based on the results of this study, in order to establish a nutrition education program based on mindfulness to improve their quality of life through physical and emotional balance for the disabled as well as those with various diseases who need each life cycle and diet in the future It is intended to be used as a basic data."
국가와 교회의 관계에 관한 정치신학적 고찰 ― 아우구스티누스와 함석헌을 중심으로,2022,"['아우구스티누스', '하나님의  도성', '함석헌', '국가', '교회', 'Augustine', 'City of God', 'Ham Seok-heon', 'State', 'Church']","아우구스티누스는 하나님의 도성에서 두 가지 사랑의 원리로 구성된 하나님의 도성과 지상의 도성의 차이를 보여주었다. 하나님의 도성은 하나님을 사랑하고 하나님께 영광을 돌리는 존재들의 공동체이며, 지상의 도성은 자기를 사랑하고 자신의 명예와 지배욕을 성취하는 이들의 공동체이다. 아우구스티누스에게 하나님의 도성이 현세적 교회와 동일하지는 않지만, 현세적 교회는 종말론적 완성을 기다리며 국가를 ‘이용’(uti)해야 하는 순례자들의 사회이다. 키케로는 로마가 인민의 행복을 위하여 ‘법적 동의’(iuris consensus)와 ‘이익 공동체’ (utilitatis communio)로 정의롭게 운영되는 공화국이라고 믿었지만, 아우구스 티누스는 그러한 이상이 인간의 타락한 본성 앞에 실상은 좌절되었으며 그러한 이상은 오직 하나님을 예배하고 하나님의 은총을 힘입어 인간의 탐욕이 절제될 때만 가능하다고 주장했다.함석헌은 현대 세계가 보여준 국가의 폭력성이 정치의 타락에 기인한다고 보았으며, 그러한 정치를 회복시킬 사명이 종교에 있다고 보았다. 함석헌은 초창기 무교회주의에서는 현세적 교회 조직의 타락성을 예언자적 음성으로 질타하고 오직 천상의 교회만이 순수한 거룩한 공동체라고 선언했다. 하지만 후기에 이르러 천상의 공동체가 씨알(민중)을 통해  구현될  가능성을  믿었으며, 이를  위해  종교(기독교)와 정치가 막스 베버처럼  상호보완적  관계를  맺으며  종교가  정치의  나아갈  방향을 제시해야  한다고  보았다. 이것은  한나  아렌트가  아우구스티누스를 재해석하여  자신만의  방식대로  전용한  것처럼  인간이  세계의  영속성을 구현하는  것이  참된  정치의  길이라고  믿었던  것에  수렴된다. 하지만  포스트  담론에서  정치의  토대가  되는  보편은  보편들로, 주체는 주체화로, 단일의  정치는  복수의  정치로  바뀌었음을 상기해볼  때, 교회의 정치  참여는  인식론적  한계에  부딪힐  수밖에  없게  된다. 아우구스티누스는  인간의  연약함에  대한  깊은  성찰로  하나님께  전적으로  의존하며 세상의  도성과  연계되지  않은  순수한  하나님의  도성으로  참된  기독교 정치의  가능성을  보여주었다. 따라서  오늘날  교회는  국가를  절대화 하지  않으면서도  적절히  ‘이용’(uti)하는  지혜가  필요하며, 오직  하나님 만을  진정으로  ‘향유’(furi)하는  순례자의  삶을  살아가야  함을  알게  된 다.","Augustine showed the difference between the city of God and the city on earth, which are composed of two principles of love in the City of God. The city of God is a community of beings who love and glorify God, while the city on earth is a community of those who love themselves and achieve their lust for honor and domination. Although, for Augustine, the city of God is not identical to the church on earth, the temporal church is a society of pilgrims who must “use”(uti) the state, awaiting eschatological consummation. Cicero believed that Rome was a republic that was justly governed by “legal consent”(iuris consensus) and “community of interest”(utilitatis communio) for the welfare of the people. However, Augustine argued that such an ideal was, in fact, thwarted in the face of man’s fallen nature, and that it was only possible through the worship of God and the restraint of man’s greed by the grace of God.Ham Seok-heon believed that the state’s violence in the modern world was due to the corruption of politics, and religion had a duty to restore such politics. In the early nonchurch movement, Ham Seok-heon denounced the depravity of the church organization on earth with a prophetic voice and declared that only the church in heaven is a pure, holy community. However, in the latter days, he believed in the possibility that the heavenly community could be realized through the ssial(minjung). To this end, he saw that religion(Christianity) and politics, like Max Weber, had a complementary relationship, and that religion should provide a direction for politics. This converges on what humans believed to be the true path of politics to embody the permanence of the world, just as Hannah Arendt reinterpreted and adapted Augustine in her own way.However, when we recall in the post discourse that the universals that form the basis of politics have changed to universals, the subject of subjectivization, and the politics of unity to politics of pluralism, the church’s political participation inevitably encounters epistemological limitations. Augustine showed the possibility of true Christian politics as a pure city of God that is completely dependent on God and not connected with the city of the world through deep reflection on human weakness. Therefore, the church needs the wisdom to properly “use”(uti) without absolutizing the state, and learn that it must live as a pilgrim who truly “enjoys”(furi) only God."

호떡의 연원과 변화 양상 고찰-쌍화점에서 안흥찐빵까지-,2022,"['호떡', '찐빵', '쌍화', '호병(胡餠)', '식문화', 'Hotteok(호떡)', 'Jjinppang(찐빵)', 'Steamed Bun', 'Ssanghwa(쌍화)', 'Culinary Culture.']","Hotteok(호떡) is one of the most representative street foods in modern-day Korea. The consensus of opinion is that it originates from Western China, in line with the Chinese prefix ‘ho(胡)’. However, it is open to debate whether the appearance of “hotteok” has stayed the same as that of the original introduced in Korea, through China.There is a scene of the Emperor Xuanzong of Tang having hotteok for lunch within the Tonggamjeoryo(通鑑節要), alongside the two contrasting explanations about the food. One says it was steamed rice cake with sesame seeds and the other claims it was rice cake cooked in a brazier by the Hu barbarians. Both methods differ from the recipe of the Hotteok we know, which is seared in oil. Particularly, the steaming method is more similar to those of Ssanghwa(쌍화) of Goryeo(an ancient Korean state) and Chinese dumpling. In that sense, the Ssanghwa eatery run by Hoehoeabi(회회아비), who is mentioned in the Goryeo Song(Goryeogayo) Ssanghwajeom, is thought to have been a Hotteok canteen run by a native of Western China.According to the literature, the Hotteok in Joseon was both steamed and seared. Nevertheless, it is assumed not to have been popularized since flour and sugar were luxury goods until this time, and also have had a different shape.Three distinct incidents contributed to the development of Hotteok of today. The first occurrence was the foundation of sugar manufacturers and flour mill companies in the 1920s, reducing the prices of sugar and flour. It started to popularize among the general public thanks to its cheap price and sweet taste. While people used to call melted sugar ‘honey’, the formula was the same as those of Goryeo and Joseon. Furthermore, the steamed version was widely known as the Hotteok, whereas it was called Hotteok, Jjinppang(steamed bun) or dumpling at the same time.The second event was the emergence of a new cooking technique utilizing a griddle, as Koreans replaced the Chinese Hotteok merchants after the liberation and declination of the Chinese influence in Korea. It was probably the Korean substitute for the tandoor. The word Jjinppang appears in the newspapers after the year 1950, and the distinction between Jjinppang and Hotteok is made through the increase of seared Hotteok vendors.The last milestone was around 1970, alongside the mass production of soy bean based cooking oil and thus Hotteok started to be prepared almost deep fried. At this point the steamed Hotteok of Sim Sunnyeo－who learned the recipe in a Hotteok eatery near the Wonju Terminal, and established a business in Anheung in 1968－under the name Jjinppang gained its fame.As the result, the Hotteok we know and love today is established to be a rice cake made of fermented flour dough and sugar filling seared as if fried, and the steamed Hotteok became Jjinppang made of fermented flour dough and red bean paste. Meanwhile the steamed Hotteok of Goryeo, which counts as the precursor of Hotteok kept the name Ssanghwa(or Sanghwa) until Joseon, seared Hotteok is referred to as Chinese Hotteok or Hangari Hotteok. Griddled Hotteok remains under the names such as traditional Hotteok and old-timey Hotteok.",다국어 초록 정보 없음
Current Status and Future Prospects on Nuclear Forensics Technical Capability Buildings at the Integrated Support Center for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Nuclear Security at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency,2022,"['Nuclear forensics', 'Nuclear Security', 'Nuclear material assay', 'Radiation measurement', 'Microscopic analysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Nuclear security event involving nuclear and other radioactive materials outside of regulatory control (MORC) has the potential to cause severe consequences for public health, the environment, the economy and society. Each state has a responsibility to develop national nuclear security measures including nuclear forensics to respond to such events. In Japan, national nuclear forensics capability building efforts mainly based on research and development (R&D) have been conducted since 2010, in accordance with national statement of Japan at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington DC. Most of that work is undertaken at the Integrated Support Center for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Nuclear Security (ISCN) of the Japan Atmic Energy Agency (JAEA) in close cooperation with other competent authorities. The ISCN has made increased contributions to the enhancement of international nuclear security by establishing technical capabilities in nuclear forensics and sharing the achievements with the international community. The ISCN has mainly engaged in R&Ds for establishing and enhancing nuclear forensics technical capability. As for the laboratory capability, several new pieces of analytical equipment have been introduced for nuclear forensics R&D purposes. High-precise measurement techniques validated in the past nuclear forensics incidents have been established, and novel techniques that can contribute to the more timely and confident nuclear forensics signature analysis have been developed. The ISCN has been also developed a proto-type nuclear forensics library based on the data of nuclear materials possessed for past nuclear fuel cycle research in JAEA. These technical capability developments have been conducted based on the cooperation with international partners such as the U.S. Department of Energy and EC Joint Research Center, as well as participation in exercises organized by Nuclear Forensics International Technical Working Group (NF-ITWG). Recent R&D works have been mainly based on the needs of domestic competent authorities, such as first responders and investigators, and aim to develop technologies covering the entire spectrum of nuclear forensics processes from crime scene investigation to laboratory analysis and interpretation. One important key issue is the enhancement of technical capability for post-dispersion nuclear forensics. For instance, the ISCN has carried out the development of radiation measurement equipment coupled with the low-cost and mobile radiation detectors that uses machine-learning algorithms for quick and autonomous radioisotope identification to support first responders during crime scene investigations. Laboratory measurement techniques for samples collected at a post-dispersion crime scene are also among the important technical issues studied at the ISCN. The application of emerging technologies to nuclear forensics has also been studied. This includes the application of deep leaning models to nuclear forensics signature interpretation that could provide more confident results, as well as the development of contamination imaging technology that could contribute to the analytical planning on the samples in collaboration with conventional forensics. Many analytical techniques have been developed and the capability to analyze nuclear and other radioactive materials for nuclear forensics purposes has been considerably matured over the past decade. The challenges of post-dispersion samples, collaboration with conventional forensics and the development of novel signatures will be more important in the near future. Therefore, the ISCN will promote the R&Ds to further enhance the technical capabilities solving these issues. In addition, the ISCN is also promoting to expand the nuclear forensics research into universities and other research institutes in Japan. This is expected to contribute to the establishment of a domestic nuclear forensics network that enables to respond timely and flexibly to the MORC incidents, and to the maturation of nuclear forensics as a new academic field."

(1) 신구약 성경 전체의 빛 아래서 해석한다. (2) 하나님의 본성의 빛에 비추어 해석한다. (3) 하나님께 대한 경배의 의무(1-4계명)와 이웃에 대한 사랑의 의무(5-10계명)는 상호 연관성 을 가진 것으로 해석해야 한다. (4) 하나님께서 율법을 주신 본래의‘목 적’을 깊이 고려하여 해석해야 한다. 칼빈은 율법의 제 3용법을 신자의 삶을 지도하는 규범으로 인식하고, 율법은 단지 지식으로만 그치는 것 이 아니라 삶의 변화를 꾀하는 실천적 목적으로 한다. 특히 칼빈에게 있어서 하나님의 적응은 계시와 그리스도의 성육신만 아니라 하나님의 제정하신 제도로서의 설교에서도 드러난다. 따라서 설교자는 회중을 위해 하나님의 적응하심을 본받아 먼저 말씀을 힘써 배우고, 하나님 말 씀만을 전하며, 겸손과 솔선수범의 모범을 보여야 한다. 동시에 칼빈은 청중의 올바른 설교 청취의 자세를 가르친다. 칼빈의 십계명 설교의 특 징은 내용적으로 신자들의 사단과의 영적 전투, 하나님의 주권과 인간 의 책임을 균형 있게 가르치며, 형식적으로는 직접화법과 대화법, 긍정과 부정의 기법을 활용한다. 마지막으로 칼빈의 십계명 강해는 한국교 회에게 율법의 제 3용법의 활용, 하나님의 정하신 제도로서의 설교, 하 나님의 적응을 따른 설교자의 청중에의 적응, 그리고 청중들의 설교 청 취에서의 올바른 자세를 촉구한다.","This article aims to help ministers to preach the Decalogue in the Korean church by examining Calvin’s expository sermons on the Ten Commandments from a homiletical point of view. Calvin’s sermons on the Decalogue show a distinctive mark of Reform theology. Calvin has four hermeneutical principles for the Ten Commandments. (1) To interpret under the light of the entire Old and New Testament. (2) To interpret in the light of God’s nature. (3) The duty to worship God (commandments 1-4) and the duty to love one’s neighbor (commandments 5-10) should be interpreted as being interrelated. (4) It should be interpreted with deep consideration of the original ‘purpose’ for which God gave the law. Calvin recognizes the third use of the law as a norm that guides the life of the believer, and the law has a practical purpose to change the believer’s lives. In particular, for Calvin, God’s accommodation is applied to not only in revelation and Christ’s incarnation but also to preaching as an institution ordained by God. Therefore, the preacher following God’s accommodation should first strive to learn the Word of God, preach only the Word of God, and set an example of humility and good life for the sake of congregation. At the same time, Calvin teaches the audience the correct attitude to listen to the sermons. With a respect to the contents of the sermons, Calvin’s sermons on the Ten Commandments is characterized by believers’ spiritual warfare with Satan, and by a balanced teaching of God’s sovereignty and human responsibility. Formally, in Calvin’s sermons the skills of direct speech, dialogue, and affirmation and negation are used. Lastly, Calvin’s sermons of the Ten Commandments urges the use of the third use of the law, and teaches preaching as God’s ordained institution, the preacher’s adaptation to God’s accommodation, and the correct attitude of the audience in listening to the sermon for the Korean churches."

As a result of analyzing my teaching, my class was buried in the ‘difficulty and complexity of writing a self-introduction’, resulting in the poor achievement of students. Accordingly, I tried to find ways to improve the class while keeping the following in mind. First, the dimness in the students’ perception when it comes to their future employment is considered more carefully and reflected in the class design. In addition, with the advent of the AI era, various engineering discussions related to self-introductions are being announced. Thus, major discussions, such as developing a deep learning model that can identify good self-introductions, will be actively used in the class. It is hoped that the students’ vague fear of self-introductions can be offset through more sophisticated and colorful changes in teaching methods."

Compared to the past, the production costs of digital humans today have been significantly reduced due to technological development, and the scope of this technology’s utilization has been extended with the emergence of various social media that enables active interaction of digital humans with the public. However, compared to technological development and market expansion, studies on utilization cases of media based on digital human production techniques remain insufficient. Therefore, this study aims to provide practical implications for digital human content production in the future by analyzing the characteristics of utilization cases of video media according to the types of digital human production techniques. (Method) This study first confirmed the theoretical definition of digital humans, further classifying them into three types based on the classification criteria of production methods in previous studies: real image composition, Full 3D, and artificial intelligence (AI). The scope of the study was limited to video media, and it was divided into real-time and non-real-time according to the production method. (Results) This study analyzed utilization cases of video media based on digital human production techniques. The real image composition type had high efficiency due to low production time and production costs; however, it was not suitable for real-time video because the composition looked unnatural depending on the angle or movement of the face if the video continued in real time for a long period. As most full 3D types are produced based on game engines, they produce high-quality results graphically; however, motion capture continues to be unstable to be transmitted in real time; therefore, it is suitable for non-real-time video. AI type is mostly used in the form of restoring real people based on deep learning, which is most suitable for real-time broadcasting as mouth movement looks natural in this case, and it is possible to respond immediately based on the contents learned in advance. (Conclusions) Through the analysis results, it was possible to identify differences and limitations in efficiency, detail, and real-time response by type of digital human production techniques and to determine whether the type was suitable for real-time or non-real-time videos. In the future, it is hoped that this study will provide producers with practical implications for using digital human production techniques in media in a way most suited to each type."

And when these minorities are integrated into one race, they continue to have a sense of fate and community that they have the same lineage or the same historical experience, and furthermore, there may be a cultural community perception that shares cultural commonalities. Therefore, ethnicity can be created and changed according to social and political situations, and the national identity formed by this has a cultural community character. In this regard, just as culture continues to change with universality and specificity depending on the region and country, ethnic culture is also transmitted to the next generation, and new cultural elements are involved, learned, or adapted in the process. In addition, it is handed down in various aspects depending on the times and regions and develops into locality, ethnicity, and nationality. On the other hand, new cultural elements are propagated by cultural contact between ethnic groups, resulting in cultural changes. As a result of the contact of ethnic minorities with foreign cultures, cultural convergence in which new cultures emerge, and the influx of foreign cultures completely absorbs and dismantles or disappears existing cultures. This study analyzed hunting culture, clothing culture, residential culture, food culture, mythical culture, toy culture, and holiday culture with the aim of examining the identity, cultural generality, diversity, relativity, specificity, and homogeneity of minorities. The cultural basis of the Siberian-Arctic minority identity can be said to be hunting culture and myth (worship) culture. Despite the decrease in the influence of myth (worship) culture by accepting the sophistication of the Russian people, the tradition of myth (worship) culture is fused to holiday culture and delivered to descendants. The use of iron tools, gunpowder guns, and boats in hunting culture has led to the development of hunting technology and harmonization of hunting culture among ethnic groups. Furthermore, the hunting culture changed rapidly due to the influence of industrialization, and the food culture and clothing culture that are deeply related to this changed significantly. However, the collective form of hunting, a mental culture aspect, is still maintained today. It seems that there is a great deal of deep connection and interaction between the cultural elements that make up the identity of the Siberian-Arctic minority. Hunting culture is considered to have an influence in the order of residential (residential) culture, food culture, clothing culture, holiday culture, and music culture, and mythical (worship) culture in the order of holiday culture, clothing culture, music culture, and toy culture. It can be said that hunting culture dominates matter (economy), and myth (worship) culture dominates the spiritual world. As a result of the study, the national identity of the Siberian-Arctic minority shows that national identity is clear when a small number of cultural elements among the cultural elements that are the basis of identity have a large influence on other cultural elements. Therefore, as the influence of hunting culture is reduced due to the spread of science and technology, national identity based on material culture is bound to weaken. However, despite the spread of Christianity, myth (worship) culture seems to play a major role in preserving national identity based on mental culture by maintaining its influence through succession between generations."
"인공지능, 기생화된 타자아와의 대화? -영화 〈업그레이드〉에서 스템의 생존방식을 중심으로-",2022,"['웨어러블 디바이스', '인공지능', '인간의 몸', '포스트 휴먼', 'wearable device', 'AI', 'human body', 'posthuman']","인공지능이 인간 시대의 종말을 고하고 인류의 마지막 발명품이 될 것인가? ‘기계가 인간을 넘어서는 특이점에 도달하면 인간은 컴퓨터와 융합하는 영생의 슈퍼우먼으로 증강될 것’이라는 미래학자 레이 커즈와일의 주장과는 달리, 제임스 배럿은 ‘초인공지능으로 인하여 인류는 재앙을 맞이할 것’이라는 비관적인 시나리오를 전한다. 이러한 인공지능 관련 논쟁의 중심에는 ‘인간의 생물학적 특징이 인공지능으로 구현될 수 있는가?’라는 인간의 신체성 문제가 있다. 본 논문은 2018년 제작한 리 워넬 감독의 영화 <업그레이드>에서 하나의 신체에 공존하는 두 자아, 즉 주인공 그레이와 그의 뇌에 이식된 인공지능 스템의 문제를 인간 지식의 형성과 신체성을 중심으로 비평적으로 논하고자 한다.  <업그레이드>는 인공지능이 일상화된 가까운 미래를 배경으로 한 SF영화이다. 신기술로 장애를 극복하고자 하는 인간의 욕망과 갈등에서 빚어지는 초인공지능 시대에나 가능한 내용이다. 괴한에게 아내를 잃은 그레이는 이식된 인공지능 스템의 도움으로 아내의 복수를 한다. 이는 스템에 의한 신공에 가까운 무술 능력 때문이다. 물질적 신체가 없던 스템에 의한 신체의 증강은 체현된 경험적 지식이 아니기 때문에 단순 데이터에 의한 학습만으로 실제 뛰어난 무술 실력을 얻는 것은 문제가 있다. 빅데이터를 딥러닝으로 학습한 인공신경망의 인공지능과는 달리 인간의 지식은 과거의 기억을 불러와 추론하거나, 오감으로 체화한 경험, 사회적 상호작용으로 축적된 경험 등이 지각과 인지과정을 거쳐 형성된다. 바꿔 말하면 인간의 지식은 인공지능과는 지식을 얻는 방식이 다르다.  영화 <업그레이드>는 인간과 유사한 정신과 의식이 인공지능에도 자율과 주체적 인식과 함께 가능하다는 결론이다. 인공지능이 인류의 마지막 발명품이 될 비극적 결말이다. 그러나 설령 초지능의 사이보그를 발명하더라도 인간과는 다른 개체로 발전할 가능성이 크다. 따라서 영화 <업그레이드>에서 인공지능에 인격권을 부여하기에는 아직은 시기상조이다. 이는 자아와 타자의 문제, 인간의 신체성과 지식, 경험의 문제로 귀결된다. 인간의 주체적 인식과는 다른 개체로서의 인정 여부에 의해서 상호성이 인정될 수 있다.","Will artificial intelligence mark the end of the human era and become mankind’s last invention? Contrary to futurist Ray Kurzweil’s assertion that ‘when machines reach a singularity that surpasses humans, humans will be augmented into superwomen of eternal life who fuse with computers’, James Barrett said, ‘It conveys a pessimistic scenario of ’. At the center of this artificial intelligence-related debate is the issue of human physicality, ‘Can human biological characteristics be realized by artificial intelligence?’. This thesis is a critique of the problem of two selves coexisting in one body, that is, the main character Gray and the artificial intelligence Stem implanted in his brain, in the 2018 film “Upgrade” by director Lee Warnell, focusing on the formation of human knowledge and physicality.  『Upgrade』 is a sci-fi movie set in the near future, where artificial intelligence is commonplace. This is only possible in the age of super-artificial intelligence, which arises from human desire and conflict to overcome obstacles with new technologies. Gray, who lost his wife to a gangster, seeks revenge on his wife with the help of an implanted artificial intelligence Stem. This is because of the martial arts ability that is close to the great skills of the Stem. Because body augmentation by the Stem without a physical body is not embodied empirical knowledge, there is a problem in obtaining excellent martial arts skills only by learning from simple data. Unlike the artificial intelligence of artificial neural networks, which learned big data through deep learning, human knowledge is obtained by recalling past memories and inferring, experiences embodied in the five senses, and experiences accumulated through social interactions through perception and recognition processes. is formed In other words, human knowledge is different from artificial intelligence in the way it acquires knowledge.  The movie upgrade is a conclusion that human-like mind and consciousness are possible even with artificial intelligence with autonomy and subjective recognition. The tragic end is that artificial intelligence will be mankind’s last invention. However, even if a superintelligent cyborg is invented, there is a high possibility that it will develop into an individual different from humans. Therefore, the movie upgrade is still too early to give AI the right to personality. This results in the problem of the self and the other, and the problem of the human body, knowledge, and experience. Reciprocity can be recognized by whether it is recognized as an individual different from human subjective recognition."
"국내 주요 환경보건 재난의 전개 과정과 그 교훈, 그리고 환경보건 전문가의 역할",2022,"['Humidifier disinfectant', 'phenol contamination', 'oil spill', 'pollution disease']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In today’s civilization, it can be impossible to prevent disasters that cause large-scale human and material harm, and the environmental industry is not excepted from this. Over the last 50 years, several large and small environmental health catastrophes have occurred in Korea. Notable instances include the phenol pollution accident in the Nakdong River, the Hebei Spirit oil spill in Taean, Chungcheongnam-do, and the humidifier disinfectant disaster. Looking at these instances, it is clear that the government failed to prevent similar incidents and accidents after the tragedies. The government created and executed different policies to prevent such incidents and accidents, but the majority of them were highly fragmented. It is understandable that depending on the political and social level of the society in which the environmental health hazard incident/ accident happened, the investigation of the cause, countermeasures, and policy reaction may differ. To put it another way, the more authoritarian and non-democratic a political social system is, the more likely it is to cover up occurrences and accidents without a deep examination. This is in line with the members of society s level of political awareness and acknowledgment of the importance of life and safety. In 1985, when the Onsan pollution disease was discovered, and in 2011, when we recognized the realities of the humidifier disinfectant disaster, South Korea s political and social systems were entirely different."
Development of a Breath Control Training System for Breath-Hold Techniques and Respiratory-Gated Radiation Therapy,2022,"['Respiratory-gated radiotherapy', 'Breath-hold', 'Breath control training system', 'Deep inspiration breath hold']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: This study aimed to develop a breath control training system for breath-hold technique and respiratory-gated radiation therapy wherein the patients can learn breath-hold techniques in their convenient environment. Methods: The breath control training system comprises a sensor device and software. The sensor device uses a loadcell sensor and an adjustable strap around the chest to acquire respiratory signals. The device connects via Bluetooth to a computer where the software is installed. The software visualizes the respiratory signal in near real-time with a graph. The developed system can signal patients through visual (software), auditory (buzzer), and tactile (vibrator) stimulation when breath-holding starts. A motion phantom was used to test the basic functions of the developed breath control training system. The relative standard deviation of the maxima of the emulated free breathing data was calculated. Moreover, a relative standard deviation of a breath-holding region was calculated for the simulated breath-holding data. Results: The average force of the maxima was 487.71 N, and the relative standard deviation was 4.8%, while the average force of the breath hold region was 398.5 N, and the relative standard deviation was 1.8%. The data acquired through the sensor was consistent with the motion created by the motion phantom. Conclusions: We have developed a breath control training system comprising a sensor device and software that allow patients to learn breath-hold techniques in their convenient environment."
