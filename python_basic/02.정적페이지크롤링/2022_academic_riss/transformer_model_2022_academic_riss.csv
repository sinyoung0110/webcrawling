An Improved Mathematical Model for Estimating Polarization Parameters of Transformer Oil-Paper Insulation,2022,"['Transformer', 'Oil-paper insulation', 'Recovery voltage method', 'Improved mathematical model', 'Particle swarm optimization algorithm']",,"The parameters of dielectric response based on extended Debye circuit model can refl ect oil-paper insulation state. The model using the initial slop of recovery voltage to estimate circuit parameters, serve as good quality consistency with the measured data. However, the model can be applicable for large power transformers but not for distribution transformers. This paper proposed an improved mathematical model using recovery voltage peak, peak time and initial slope characteristics to solve dielectric response equivalent circuit parameters. The identifi cation of equivalent circuit parameters is converted into a mathematical optimization problem. And then particle swarm optimization algorithm is used for solving the problem.The improved mathematical model can decrease sampling data of recovery voltage. To check the validity of the estimated parameters, the on-site measured data of RVM experiments on actual transformers in various capacities is applied. The calculated result shows that the recovery voltage curve calculated and measured recovery voltage curve have good consistency, which can be advantageous to diagnose the oil-paper insulation status of transformer. It illustrates that the improved method proposed in this paper is feasible and eff ective."
ANN Based Model for Current Transformers’ Saturation Error Compensation in Medium Voltage Switchgears,2022,"['Artificial neural network (ANN)', 'Current transformer (CT)', 'CT saturation', 'Medium voltage (MV)']",,"Current Transformers’ saturation has been a major challenge facing protection engineers’ to-date even with the advent of diff erential protection system. This saturation causes erroneous measurement of the service currents which can lead to malfunctioning of protection relays and consequently cause false or delayed system trips with severe consequences to the power plant. This research presents an artifi cial neural networks (ANN) based approach for the compensation of these saturation errors caused by secondary current waveform distortions under transient or fault state. In this research, an ANN algorithm to be implemented in the numerical protection device systems to compensate for these errors was developed. This ANN model applies the multi-regression technique to map a point-to-point compensated waveform referred from the saturated waveform data and ideal/calculated current waveform from the current transformer. The model is developed and trained on python platform with validation and tests to effi ciently work with accuracy under the various simulated extreme circuit conditions that the MV system could experience. Electrical transient analyzer program and electromagnetic transient’s program-restructured version software were used to model and simulate current transformer’s transient scenarios generating suffi cient waveform data to train, validate and test the ANN algorithm. The model’s processing speed and accuracy was found to be satisfactory for real time application in digital protection devices."

This study aimed to compare the performanceof three pre-training models that have recently attracted significant attention and to determine which model is more suitablefor PHI recognition. Methods: We compared the PHI recognition performance of deep learning models using the i2b2 2014dataset. We used the three pre-training models—namely, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT),robustly optimized BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa), and XLNet (model built based on Transformer-XL)—to detectPHI. After the dataset was tokenized, it was processed using an inside-outside-beginning tagging scheme and WordPiecetokenizedto place it into these models. Further, the PHI recognition performance was investigated using BERT, RoBERTa,and XLNet. Results: Comparing the PHI recognition performance of the three models, it was confirmed that XLNet had asuperior F1-score of 96.29%. In addition, when checking PHI entity performance evaluation, RoBERTa and XLNet showeda 30% improvement in performance compared to BERT. Conclusions: Among the pre-training models used in this study,XLNet exhibited superior performance because word embedding was well constructed using the two-stream self-attentionmethod. In addition, compared to BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet showed superior performance, indicating that they were moreeffective in grasping the context."

Research on Stress Reduction Model Based on Transformer,2022,"['EEG', 'mental stress', 'music', 'self-attention', 'Transformer']",,"People are constantly exposed to stress and anxiety environment, which could contribute to a variety of psychological and physical health problems. Therefore, it is particularly important to identify psychological stress in time and to find a feasible and universal method of stress reduction. This research investigated the influence of different music, such as relaxation music and natural rhythm music, on stress relief based on Electroencephalogram signals. Mental arithmetic test was implemented to create a stressful environment. 23 participants performed the mental arithmetic test with and without music respectively, while their Electroencephalogram signal was recorded. The effect of music on stress relief was verified through stress test questionnaires, including Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) and Self-Stress Assessment. There was a significant change in the stress test questionnaire values with and without music according to paired t-test (p<0.01). Furthermore, a model based on Transformer for stress level classification from Electroencephalogram signal was proposed. Experimental results showed that the method of listening to relaxation music and natural rhythm music achieved the effect of reducing psychological stress and the proposed model yielded a promising accuracy in classifying the Electroencephalogram signal of mental stress."

In Korean,a sentence is a sequence of eojeols (words) separated by spaces. Each eojeol comprises one or more morphemes. Korean morphologicalanalysis (KMA) is to divide eojeols in a given Korean sentence into morpheme units. It also includes assigning appropriatepart-of-speech(POS) tags to the resulting morphemes. KMA is one of the most important tasks in Korean natural language processing(NLP). Improving the performance of KMA is closely related to increasing performance of Korean NLP tasks. Recent research on KMAhas begun to adopt the approach of machine translation (MT) models. MT is to convert a sequence (sentence) of units of one domaininto a sequence (sentence) of units of another domain. Neural machine translation (NMT) stands for the approaches of MT that exploitneural network models. From a perspective of MT, KMA is to transform an input sequence of units belonging to the eojeol domain intoa sequence of units in the morpheme domain. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model for KMA. The backbone of our modelis based on the BERT-fused model which was shown to achieve high performance on NMT. The BERT-fused model utilizes Transformer,a representative model employed by NMT, and BERT which is a language representation model that has enabled a significant advancein NLP. The experimental results show that our model achieves 98.24 F1-Score."

Local Extrema Refinement Based Tensor Product Model Transformation Controller Design with Vary Input Methods,2022,"['Convex hull manipulation', 'local extrema refinement (LR)', 'tensor product (TP) model transformation', 'TS fuzzy model', 'vary input (VI).']",,"Tensor product model transformation could find a convex polytope representation similar to the TakagiSugeno (TS) fuzzy model from the given quasi-linear variable parameter (quasi-LPV) system model. TP models have proposed many convex hulls manipulated methods in previous studies, but these convex hulls are designed based on classical sampling methods, and local extrema refinement methods are often ignored by these classical sampling methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a convex hull manipulate method by adding local extremum to refine the partition of the entry functions, and the method is proposed based on vary input quasi-LPV state space models. First, the TP model transformation is extended by linearizing the weighting functions that is obtained via different ways of substituted entry functions, the given TS fuzzy model is converted into an alternative TS fuzzy model, and the converted TS fuzzy models are presented with different number of inputs. The difficulty level of controller design is reduced by changing the antecedents of the fuzzy sets, so the optimized control can be achieved via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Secondly, the local extrema refinement strategy is used to implement the TP model transformation, the manipulated method of convex hull is expanded. Finally, the GOOGOL’s twowheeled self-balancing robot model is employed as the controlled object, and the tracking controller is attached for verification. At the same time, different external disturbances are considered to be added to the left and right wheels of the robot. The simulation results show that, by combining the state-space model with vary input variables and the local extrema refinement strategy, the designed controller achieved better control performance."

In this study, analysis models of the LVDT were proposed through theoretical analysis and the finite element method (FEM), and the effects of design and process variables on the sensitivity and linear region of the LVDT according to the core motion were analyzed by the proposed models. The theoretical model for the relation between the output voltage and the change in core position, including the position before entering and after passing the secondary coil, was developed by deriving the change in the mutual inductance of the primary and secondary coils. Meanwhile, the core, coil, magnetic shell, electric circuit, and core movement of the LVDT were constructed as a three-dimensional model for the FEM to obtain the voltage output using a commercial analysis program. The results of the LVDT output characteristics analyzed by the theoretical and the finite element models were mutually verified. By the verified models, a series of the analyses of the LVDT were performed with changes in the supply voltage, core size, number of primary and secondary turns, distance between coils, coil length, initial core position, and permeabilities of core and magnetic shell. The effects of those variables on the sensitivity and linear region of the LVDT could then be revealed."

We employed a feature-pyramid component in a deep neural network architecture based on the transformer encoder that is used to model the time correlation of sound signals owing to its superiority over conventional recurrent neural networks. The proposed method is motivated by the idea that the multi-scale features will make the network more robust against the dynamic duration of the sound signals depending on their classes.

Transformer may be appropriate for reconstructing skin textures where a similar pattern can be easily found even between distant regions, but the efficient super resolution transformer (ESRT) model does not exhibit acceptable perceptual quality in super resolution of clinical skin images. In this paper, we propose an extension of ESRT as a super resolution approach to reconstructing dermoscopy-level high-resolution skin images from low-resolution clinical skin images. In the propose model, the transformer backbone and the convolutional neural network backbone are connected in parallel rather than in series by changing the existing architecture to learn the features of skin lesion texture efficiently. Moreover, the perceptual loss is employed to enhance the perceptual quality of fine textures. We show that the proposed model effectively improves the perceptual quality of super resolution skin images compared to other existing models."

Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimization Model for Demand Response in a Connected Microgrid,2022,"['Smart grid', 'Demand Response', 'Stochastic dual descent', 'renewable energy sources']",,Smart power grid is a user friendly system that transforms the traditional electric grid to the one that operates in a co-operative and reliable manner. Demand Response (DR) is one of the important components of the smart grid. The DR programs enable the end user participation by which they can communicate with the electricity service provider and shape their daily energy consumption patterns and reduce their consumption costs. The increasing demands of electricity owing to growing population stresses the need for optimal usage of electricity and also to look out alternative and cheap renewable sources of electricity. The solar and wind energy are the promising sources of alternative energy at present because of renewable nature and low cost implementation. The proposed work models a smart home with renewable energy units. The random nature of the renewable sources like wind and solar energy brings an uncertainty to the model developed. A stochastic dual descent optimization method is used to bring optimality to the developed model. The proposed work is validated using the simulation results. From the results it is concluded that proposed work brings a balanced usage of the grid power and the renewable energy units. The work also optimizes the daily consumption pattern thereby reducing the consumption cost for the end users of electricity.
패션모델의 런웨이 워킹 시 발목염좌(捻挫)의 위험과 예방에 관한 연구,2022,"['패션모델', '발목염좌', '워킹', '런웨이', 'Fashion Model', 'Ankle Sprain', 'Walking', 'Runway']",,"This study investigates the risks and prevention methods for ankle sprains that can occur while models walk on stage. First, it is evident that high heels worn on stage together with the clothes on the runway are a big cause. In contrast to the simple design aspects of high heels, these causes also interfere with the powerful walking of models, and it can even lead to ankle sprains causing damages to the ligaments or broken angle joint. Second, the risk of ankle sprains can increase depending on the slipperiness of the runway floor. There are stage production aspects of the runway to make it look more glamorous and there are a wide range of materials used to add strong light reflection and shine effects. Especially in the case of materials with low surface roughness such as glass, mirrors, acrylic, fomex, and marble, there is low frict/ion between the high heel and floor surface, thus making it easy to slip on. The third reason is due to the clothes worn by models. The initial cause are models wearing clothes produced by designers and appear on stage, but another cause is the type or length of skirts and dresses. When emphasizing only the design aspect of clothes, there can be instances in which pressure is applied on the model while walking, causing the model to lose his or her balance and slip or twist ankles. In order to prevent harsh walking to result in dangers such as excessive pressure on the ankles or damage to the ligaments, flexible feet and continuous stretching of the ankles are needed. In particular, by having strong understanding on the structure of ligaments, it is becoming more and more important to relieve tension of joints before and walking, flexible movement, and strengthening of ankle muscles. Trends are changing rapidly, and fashion models should also identify the designs and transformations of clothes and high heels worn by models to reduce and prevent risks on the runway."
TransNav: spatial sequential transformer network for visual navigation,2022,"['visual navigation', 'knowledge graph', 'reinforcement learning', 'spatial attention', 'transformer network']",,"Visual navigation task is to steer an embodied agent finding the given target based on observation. The effective transformer from observation of the agent to visual representation determines the navigation actions and promotes more informed navigation policy. In this work, we propose a spatial sequential transformer network (SSTNet) for learning informative visual representation in deep reinforcement learning. SSTNet is composed by spatial attention probability fused model (SAF) and sequential transformer network (STNet). SAF enforces cross-modal state into visual clues in reinforcement learning. It encodes semantic information about observed objects, as well as spatial information about their location, which jointly exploiting image inter-relations. STNet generates (imagines) the next observations and makes action inference of the aspects most relevant to the target. It decodes the image intra-relations. This way, the agent learns to understand the causality between navigation actions and dynamic changes in observations. SSTNet is conditioned on an auto-regressive model on the desired reward, past states, actions, and knowledge graph. The whole navigation framework considers the local and global visual information, as well as time sequential information. Thus, it allows the agent to navigate towards the sought-after object effectively. We evaluate our model on the AI2THOR framework show that our method attains at least $10\%$ improvement of average success rate over most state-of-the-art models.

The results from testing these two models show that the KR-BERT-VPF-BiLSTM-CRF model (67.3%) outperformed the KR-BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model (66.4%). In addition, this study examined which hidden layer improved the performance of NLMs during training. As expected, the NLM that was trained on the last hidden layer performed better than other alternative options such as the second-to-last-hidden layer and the concatenated last four layers. Thus, this study renders support to the general observation that an NLM should be trained on the last hidden layer to reach the highest performance. This study is meaningful since it is the first attempt to investigate which hidden layer is useful to train NLMs in SRL tasks of Korean."

The subway is a means of transportation used by an average of 10 million people a day, and although it is important to create a clean and comfortable environment, the level of particulate matter pollution is shown to be high. It is because the subways run through an underground tunnel and the particulate matter trapped in the tunnel moves to the underground station due to the train wind. The Ministry of Environment and the Seoul Metropolitan Government are making various efforts to reduce PM concentration by establishing measures to improve air quality at underground stations. The smart air quality management system is a system that manages air quality in advance by collecting air quality data, analyzing and predicting the PM concentration. The prediction model of the PM concentration is an important component of this system. Various studies on time series data prediction are being conducted, but in relation to the PM prediction in subway stations, it is limited to statistical or recurrent neural network-based deep learning model researches. Therefore, in this study, we propose four transformer-based models including spatiotemporal transformers. As a result of performing PM concentration prediction experiments in the waiting rooms of subway stations in Seoul, it was confirmed that the performance of the transformer-based models was superior to that of the existing ARIMA, LSTM, and Seq2Seq models. Among the transformer-based models, the performance of the spatiotemporal transformers was the best. The smart air quality management system operated through data-based prediction becomes more effective and energy efficient as the accuracy of PM prediction improves. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the efficient operation of the smart air quality management system."
A study on handwritten parcel delivery invoice understanding model,2022,"['Optical character recognition', 'Handwritten parcel delivery invoice understanding', 'End-to-End framework', 'Document understanding transformer']",,"Optical character recognition (OCR) technology is a field of continuous research in which text images are stored or utilized as data. However, OCR technology alone has limitations in classifying and recognizing attribute values such as address, name, and phone number expressed in text in a semi-structured form, such as a parcel delivery invoice (PDI) written by hand. Therefore, in this study, we propose a handwritten parcel delivery invoice understanding (HPDIU) model for automated parcel delivery reception. The proposed HPDIU model consists of two steps: region detection of the parcel delivery invoice (RD-PDI) and information extraction from the PDI (IE-PDI). The RD-PDI, which is the first step, minimizes the resolution adjustment by detecting only the necessary area, including the sender and recipient information in the image. The second step, IE-PDI, consists of an end-to-end framework without OCR technology using a document understanding transformer and integrates the process of character detection, recognition, and understanding.In other words, the proposed model can solve the limitations of the OCR technology because it can integrate the process of classifying and recognizing according to attributes. To prove the validity of the proposed model, we used 500 handwritten PDI datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the character units according to the attributes of address, name, and phone number. As a result of the evaluation, a total average of 91.67% in units of letters proved the superiority of the proposed HPDIU model."
A Model for Machine Fault Diagnosis based on Mutual Exclusion Theory and Out-of-Distribution Detection,2022,"['out-of-distribution', 'convolutional neural network', 'mutually exclusive events', 'fusion networks', 'autoencoder']",,"The primary task of machine fault diagnosis is to judge whether the current state is normal or damaged, so it is a typical binary classification problem with mutual exclusion. Mutually exclusive events and out-of-domain detection have one thing in common: there are two types of data and no intersection. We proposed a fusion model method to improve the accuracy of machine fault diagnosis, which is based on the mutual exclusivity of events and the commonality of out-of-distribution detection, and finally generalized to all binary classification problems. It is reported that the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) will decrease as the recognition type increases, so the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is used as the primary model. Two VAE models are used to train the machine's normal and fault sound data. Two reconstruction probabilities will be obtained during the test. The smaller value is transformed into a correction value of another value according to the mutually exclusive characteristics. Finally, the classification result is obtained according to the fusion algorithm. Filtering normal data features from fault data features is proposed, which shields the interference and makes the fault features more prominent.

The mathematical models of current prediction, first-order compensation, and cost function are presented by analyzing the prediction current control strategy of the conventional models. Within a control cycle, the simplified model predictive current control algorithm applies two voltage vectors and omits the error calculation of cost function. The anticipated voltage of transformer obtained from the beat-free current control standard is considered the reference voltage, and the judgment of the area, where the reference voltage vector is found and the strategy for double voltage vector is selected, is put forward. The optimal voltage vector can be directly output without the error calculation of the cost function in the method, thereby effectively reducing the computation load and complexity of the system and improving the steady-state performance. Experimental results verify the validity and accuracy of the proposed simplified model of predictive current control strategy for PMSM control."

An Improved and Efficient Analytical Model for Magnetic Field Calculation in Linear Permanent Magnet Machines,2022,"['coordinate transformation', 'curvature factor', 'simplified sub-domain model', 'magnetic field']",,"A simple and improved analytical model (AM) for linear permanent magnet synchronous machine (LPMSM) based on the correction factor is presented in this paper. A slotless linear permanent magnet machine (PLPM) with AM developed in Cartesian coordinate is selected to investigate.

The efficiency of converting large amounts of speech into text accurately with limited resources has become more vital than ever. In this study, we propose a method to rapidly recognize a large speech database via a transformer-based end-to-end model. Transformers have improved the state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, they are not easy to use for long sequences. In this study, various techniques to accelerate the recognition of real-world speeches are proposed and tested, including decoding via multiple-utterance-batched beam search, detecting end of speech based on a connectionist temporal classification (CTC), restricting the CTC-prefix score, and splitting long speeches into short segments. Experiments are conducted with the Librispeech dataset and the real-world Korean ASR tasks to verify the proposed methods. From the experiments, the proposed system can convert 8 h of speeches spoken at real-world meetings into text in less than 3 min with a 10.73% character error rate, which is 27.1% relatively lower than that of conventional systems."

In the results of the simulation, the mathematical model and experiment, the resonance frequency and the magnitude matched with less than 5% error. Through this, the common-mode noise is predicted accurately using the high-frequency mathematical model proposed in the paper."

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid forecasting model. In this hybrid forecasting model, an effi cient hybrid decomposition method is fi rst developed by a new combination mechanism between the ensemble empirical mode decomposition, approximate entropy, and empirical wavelet transform, enhancing the effi ciency and accuracy problems of traditional decomposition methods.Afterward, a new hybrid neural network called broad learning system-back propagation (BLS-BP) is established to predict multiple signal sequences from the proposed hybrid decomposition method. Specifi cally, in the proposed BLS-BP, a broad learning system can eff ectively reduce the computational cost, however, BP can eff ectively improve the prediction accuracy.Therefore, a reasonable combination of BLS and BP is established to obtain the compromise between computational cost and prediction accuracy. Finally, to improve the generalization ability of the model, a hybrid network based on the sliding window and cross-validation method is proposed, further improving the predictive accuracy.

Then the classical model is generalized by utilizing the Caputo fractional order derivative. The generalized equations are then non-dimensionalized by using appropriate dimensionless variables. The exact dimensionless solutions are obtained via the joint application of Laplace & Hankel integral transforms. The influence of various embedded parameters on both the velocities (blood and magnetic particles) and the temperature distribution are presented graphically. It is worth noting that the particle and blood velocities decrease for increasing the values of magnetic parameter (H) which is useful to control the blood flow during magnetic therapy (for treating pain, such as the back, foot, or joint pain) and surgeries. It is worth noting that fractional model better describes the flow behavior than classical model by providing virous integral curves as shown in Fig."
SwinE-Net: hybrid deep learning approach to novel polyp segmentation using convolutional neural network and Swin Transformer,2022,"['polyp segmentation', 'convolutional neural networks', 'multidilation convolutional block', 'multifeature aggregation block', 'Swin Transformer', 'Vision Transformer']",,"Prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) by inspecting and removing colorectal polyps has become a global health priority because CRC is one of the most frequent cancers in the world. Although recent U-Net-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with deep feature representation and skip connections have shown to segment polyps effectively, U-Net-based approaches still have limitations in modeling explicit global contexts, due to the intrinsic nature locality of convolutional operations. To overcome these problems, this study proposes a novel deep learning model, SwinE-Net, for polyp segmentation that effectively combines a CNN-based EfficientNet and Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Swin Ttransformer. The main challenge is to conduct accurate and robust medical segmentation in maintaining global semantics without sacrificing low-level features of CNNs through Swin Transformer. First, the multidilation convolutional block generates refined feature maps to enhance feature discriminability for multilevel feature maps extracted from CNN and ViT. Then, the multifeature aggregation block creates intermediate side outputs from the refined polyp features for efficient training. Finally, the attentive deconvolutional network-based decoder upsamples the refined and combined feature maps to accurately segment colorectal polyps. We compared the proposed approach with previous state-of-the-art methods by evaluating various metrics using five public datasets (Kvasir, ClinicDB, ColonDB, ETIS, and EndoScene). The comparative evaluation, in particular, proved that the proposed approach showed much better performance in the unseen dataset, which shows the generalization and scalability in conducting polyp segmentation. Furthermore, an ablation study was performed to prove the novelty and advantage of the proposed network. The proposed approach outperformed previous studies."

These signals are then projected in the time-frequency plane via the ST with a Compact Support Kernel (ST-CSK) providing the time-frequency resolution, energy concentration and robustness to noise. In this plane, PQ events are localized and characterized. The extracted features are then classifi ed using several technics. The achieved results show that an overall accuracy of 100% has been obtained with Support Vector Machines and Random Forest classifi ers even with signals embedded in high Additive White Gaussian Noise level ( SNR = 5 dB ).

The surface andcenter of the slab, which solidified with different cooling rates and secondary dendrite arm spacing, were used for kineticcalculations. Comparison between observations and calculations for slab specimens demonstrated that the moving-boundarymodel could predict retained δ-ferrite content according to various thermal histories. After this validation, the effects ofdifferent cooling rates at liquid and solid-state were analyzed to understand the importance of each stage on the diffusioncontrolledδ →  phase transformation. Decrease in solid-state cooling rate generally had a larger effect on the reduction ofδ-ferrite during cooling when the solidification rate was fast (27.75 °C/s) than when it was slow (0.075 °C/s). This model canbe used to predict and control δ-ferrite behavior under different thermal histories during slab casting and welding practices."

Polyp size is an important factor for risk stratification of malignant transformation. Endoscopic size estimation correlates poorly with pathological reports and several factors have been suggested to influence size estimation. We aimed to gain insight into the factors influencing endoscopic polyp size estimation.Methods: Images of polyps in an artificial model were obtained at 1, 3, and 5 cm from the colonoscope’s tip. Participants were asked to estimate the diameter and volume of each polyp.Results: Fifteen endoscopists from three large-volume centers participated in this study. With an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62–0.71) for diameter and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.50–0.62) for volume. Polyp size estimated at 3 cm from the colonoscope’s tip yielded the best results. A lower distance between the tip and the polyp was associated with a larger estimated polyp size.Conclusions: Correct endoscopic estimation of polyp size remains challenging. This finding can affect size estimation skills and future training programs for endoscopists."

Among fungi, Saccharomyces boulardii (SB) is the only strain known to have a probiotic function with beneficial effects on colitis; however, information on other probiotic yeast strains is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to discover yeast strains expressing intestinal anti-inflammatory activities by exhibiting probiotic properties in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mice model. Nuruk (Korean traditional fermentation starter) containing various microbial strains was used as a source for yeast strains, and S. cerevisiae 28-7 (SC28-7) strain was selected with in vitro and in vivo characteristics to enable survival in the intestines. After 14 days of pretreatment with the yeast strains, DSS was co-administered for six days to induce colitis in mice. The results revealed that the disease activity index score was lowered by SC28-7 treatment compared to the DSS group, and the colon length and weight/length ratio were recovered in a pattern similar to that of the normal group. SC28-7 administration significantly reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and modified the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, transforming growth factor-β, and interferon-γ) and proteins involved in gut barrier functions (mucin 2, mucin 3, zonula occludens-1, and occludin) in colon tissues. These results indicate that SC28-7 attenuates DSS-induced colon damage and inflammation, supporting its future use as a probiotic yeast for treating and preventing intestinal inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease."
Improving Transformer with Dynamic Convolution and Shortcut for Video-Text Retrieval,2022,"['Video representation', 'cross-modal retrieval', 'Multi-modal', 'Local Descriptors', 'Transformer']",,"Recently, Transformer has made great progress in video retrieval tasks due to its high representation capability. For the structure of a Transformer, the cascaded self-attention modules are capable of capturing long-distance feature dependencies. However, the local feature details are likely to have deteriorated. In addition, increasing the depth of the structure is likely to produce learning bias in the learned features. In this paper, an improved Transformer structure named TransDCS (Transformer with Dynamic Convolution and Shortcut) is proposed. A Multi-head Conv-Self-Attention module is introduced to model the local dependencies and improve the efficiency of local features extraction. Meanwhile, the augmented shortcuts module based on a dual identity matrix is applied to enhance the conduction of input features, and mitigate the learning bias. The proposed model is tested on MSRVTT, LSMDC and Activity-Net benchmarks, and it surpasses all previous solutions for the video-text retrieval task. For example, on the LSMDC benchmark, a gain of about 2.3% MdR and 6.1% MnR is obtained over recently proposed multimodal-based methods."

In addition, with the advent of information and communication technology (ICT), e-governance became an essential part of the government. Among the services provided by the Korean government, the Minwon24 online portal is the most used one. However, it has some processing limitations, namely: (1) it provides a cumbersome document authenticity service; (2) people cannot know what happened even if the agency handles the documents arbitrarily. To address the issues outlined above, blockchain processing can be a good alternative. It has a tremendous potential in that it has maximum transparency and a low risk of being hacked.

Exchanging, the next stage, is a transaction between the owner and the receiver.Based on this model, the actual program is built with the programming language Python. To evaluate the model, the study uses various criteria and it shows the excellence of the model in comparison to others in prior research."

A spatial heterogeneity mixed model with skew-elliptical distributions,2022,"['panel data', 'linear mixed model', 'spatial heterogeneity', 'multivariate skew-elliptical distributions', 'Bayesian hierarchical approach', 'MCMC']",,"The distribution of observations in most econometric studies with spatial heterogeneity is skewed. Usually, a single transformation of the data is used to approximate normality and to model the transformed data with a normal assumption. This assumption is however not always appropriate due to the fact that panel data often exhibit non-normal characteristics. In this work, the normality assumption is relaxed in spatial mixed models, allowing for spatial heterogeneity. An inference procedure based on Bayesian mixed modeling is carried out with a multivariate skew-elliptical distribution, which includes the skew-t, skew-normal, student-t, and normal distributions as special cases. The methodology is illustrated through a simulation study and according to the empirical literature, we fit our models to non-life insurance consumption observed between 1998 and 2002 across a spatial panel of 103 Italian provinces in order to determine its determinants. Analyzing the posterior distribution of some parameters and comparing various model comparison criteria indicate the proposed model to be superior to conventional ones."
Exploration on the New Legal Discovery Model of China's Smart Judiciary,2022,"['판례 빅데이터', '유형비교', '추상적 규범의 정형화', '법률검색', '유사사건의 동일 판결', '유사사건의 검색보고', 'Big data of cases', 'Comparison of types', 'Stereotyping of abstract norms', 'Legal discovery', 'Same judgment in similar cases', 'Retrieval report of similar cases']",,"In the process of promoting the upgrading of judicial intelligence, in order to realize the transformation of the effect of adjudication from “visible justice”―“expressing justice”― “acceptable justice”, the Supreme People’s Court of China proposed a new model of legal application based on the “retrieve system for similar cases” and supported by “brain-like intelligence technology”. However, due to the lack of innovation in legal methodology adapted to the big data of similar cases, judges still make legal discovery and “legal interpretation and reasoning” based on the small data. However, the wisdom of the legal community extracted on the basis of big data is difficult to have a substantial impact on the judge’s testimony from the level of legal methods. This makes the retrieval system of similar cases into a “chicken rib”. In order to fundamentally reverse the current problems of unclear methods of legal discovery and the ineffectiveness of the retrieval system for similar cases, it is urgent to stimulate the potential of big data technology. That is to say, through the transformation of the underlying thinking paradigm, a new mode of legal discovery is constructed, and then the efficiency of the retrieval system for similar cases is fully released. This paper adheres to the theory of “technology-institutional co-evolution” and follows the approach of “What (meaning of new legal discovery)-Why (value of new legal discovery)-How (implementation of new legal discovery)”. At the same time, this paper adopts the research methods such as the comparison of the principles of legal discovery in the two legal systems and the empirical analysis of the normative documents of the judiciary. The new model of legal discovery is based on the retrieval system of similar cases. After realizing the intelligent identification of similar cases with the help of big data, the “common factors” of similar cases are extracted through the comparison of types. Then, through the two-way communication between the abstract norm and the pending facts, the process realizes the finalization of specific specifications within the scope of the semantic range of the abstract norm. This model is conducive to unifying the standards for the application of the law and facilitates the same judgment in similar cases. In order to implement this model and improve the level of intellectualization in legal discovery, the main body of the retrieval report for similar cases should be changed from “the judge's individual combat” to “the coordinated attack of the judge + judge's assistant + lawyer”. After reducing unnecessary restrictions on starting conditions, the search is carried out for all valid cases. Next, the process of judging the similarity of similar cases is included in the presentation content of the retrieval report of similar cases. At the same time, the ranking of similar cases is based on “similarity of similar cases”, supplemented by “level of effectiveness”."
Sidewalk Gaseous Pollutants Estimation Through UAV Video-based Model,2022,"['Vehicle Emission', 'MOVES', 'Vehicle Detection', 'UAV', 'Gaussian plume']",,"As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology grew in popularity over the years, it was introduced for air quality monitoring. This can easily be used to estimate the sidewalk emission concentration by calculating road traffic emission factors of different vehicle types. These calculations require a simulation of the spread of pollutants from one or more sources given for estimation. For this purpose, a Gaussian plume dispersion model was developed based on the US EPA Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES), which provides an accurate estimate of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions from vehicles under a wide range of user-defined conditions. This paper describes a methodology for estimating emission concentration on the sidewalk emitted by different types of vehicles. This line source considers vehicle parameters, wind speed and direction, and pollutant concentration using a UAV equipped with a monocular camera. All were sampled over an hourly interval. In this article, the YOLOv5 deep learning model is developed, vehicle tracking is used through Deep SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking), vehicle localization using a homography transformation matrix to locate each vehicle and calculate the parameters of speed and acceleration, and ultimately a Gaussian plume dispersion model was developed to estimate the CO, NOx concentrations at a sidewalk point. The results demonstrate that these estimated pollutants values are good to give a fast and reasonable indication for any near road receptor point using a cheap UAV without installing air monitoring stations along the road."
A Fault Diagnosis Method of Oil-Immersed Transformer Based on Improved Harris Hawks Optimized Random Forest,2022,"['Improved Harris Hawks optimization algorithm', 'Dissolved gas analysis', 'Oil-immersed transformer', 'Fault diagnosis', 'Random forest']",,"In order to improve the accuracy and reliability of fault diagnosis for oil-immersed transformers, a fault diagnosis method for oil-immersed transformers based on improved Harris Hawks optimized random forest is proposed in this paper. First, logistic chaotic mapping is used to adjust the key parameters of the algorithm; then a nonlinear energy factor adjustment strategy is used to control the algorithm to transition from global search to local search; fi nally, the method of Gaussian mutation is introduced to strengthen the local search ability, and when the algorithm is stagnant, fi refl y perturbation is performed on the optimal solution to make the algorithm jump out of local optimum. The number of n_trees and n_layers of the random forest are jointly optimized by the improved Harris Hawks optimization algorithm, and the fault diagnosis model of oil-immersed transformer is established. The noncoded ratios of dissolved characteristic gases in oil are used as the characteristic input of the diagnosis model to obtain the fi nal diagnosis results. Compared with other models and verifi ed by examples, the results show that the proposed method has the advantage of high diagnostic accuracy and has certain practical engineering application value."
Investigation of One-dimensional Consolidation of Fractional Derivative Model for Viscoelastic Saturated Soils Caused by the Groundwater Level Change,2022,"['Variation of groundwater level', 'One-dimensional consolidation', 'Fractional differential', 'Settlement prediction', 'Analytical layer-element method']",,"The Fractional calculus theory is introduced into the Merchant model to study the mechanical characteristics of saturated soils. Laplace transform is applied to the 1D consolidation and the fractional derivative Merchant model constitutive equations of saturated soils. In the transform domain, the analytical solutions of effective stress and settlement are obtained by solving the simultaneous equation. The Crump’s method is used to the numerical inversion of Laplace transform, and the semi-analytical solution of the one-dimensional consolidation is obtained. A series of parameters, such as the fractional order, compression modulus, coefficient of viscosity, permeability coefficient and the variation models of groundwater level, are studied. Considering the continuity conditions, the 1D consolidation equation of single-layer saturated soil is generalized to multi-layer soils, and then the influence of different boundaries on several kinds of consolidation behavior was analyzed."
Creating Knowledge Graph of Electric Power Equipment Faults Based on BERT–BiLSTM–CRF Model,2022,"['Knowledge graph', 'Electric power equipment', 'Fault diagnosis', 'Entity recognition', 'Relation extraction']",,"Creating a large-scale knowledge graph of electric power equipment faults will facilitate the development of automatic fault diagnosis and intelligent question answering (QA) in the electric power industry. However, most existing methods have lower accuracy in Chinese entity recognition, thus it is hard to build such a high-quality knowledge graph by extracting knowledge from Chinese technical literature. To solve the problem, a novel model called BERT–BiLSTM–CRF is proposed. It blends Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Conditional Random Field (CRF). The model fi rstly identifi es and extracts electric power equipment entities from preprocessed Chinese technical literature. Then, the semantic relations between the entities are extracted based on the relation classifi cation method based on dependency parsing. Finally, the extracted knowledge is stored in the Neo4j database in the form of the triplet and visualized in the form of a graph. Through the above steps, a Chinese knowledge graph of electric power equipment faults can be built. The novelty of the model just lies in its subtle blend: the BERT module can not only learn phrase-level information representation, but also learn rich semantic information features; the CRF module realizes the constraint on the label prediction value and reduces the irregular recognition rate, so the accuracy rate of entity recognition is improved. Taking the Chinese technological literature, which is about fault diagnosis of electric power equipment as the experimental object, the experimental results show that the model identifi es and extracts Chinese entities more accurately than traditional methods. Thus, a comprehensive and accurate Chinese knowledge graph of electric power equipment faults could be constructed more easily."
Negative Polarity Items in English: A Deep Learning Model and Statistical Analysis,2022,"['NPI', 'BERT&lt', 'SUB&gt', 'LARGE&lt', '/SUB&gt', 'licensor', 'scope', 'monotonicity']",,"This paper examined English negative polarity items (NPIs) with a deep learning model and statistical analysis. Warstadt et al. (2019a) developed a deep learning model with the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and the study analyzed English NPIs. Their dataset included a total of 400,000 sentences, and they encoded a few linguistic variables per each sentence. This paper took the same dataset in Warstadt et al. (2019a), but one more factor (Monotonicity) was included. As for the deep learning model, this paper took the BERTLARGE model in Lee (2021), where the syntactic acceptability was calculated with numeric scores (0~100), rather than measured by the binary classification. After the acceptability scores were calculated per each sentence, the scores were converted with z -scores, and statistical analysis was conducted with six linguistic factors and interactions of three factors. Through the analysis, the followings were observed: (i) an NPI had to exist within the scope of the licensor, (ii) downward entailment also played a significant role in the NPI licensing, and (iii) the interaction between NPI licensor and scope played more crucial roles in the NPI licensing."
Novel Three-Dimensional Knitted Fabric for Pressure Ulcer Prevention: Preliminary Clinical Application and Testing in a Diabetic Mouse Model of Pressure Ulcers,2022,"['diabetes complications', 'pressure ulcer', 'streptozotocin', 'polyesters']",,"Background Population aging has led to an increased incidence of pressure ulcers, resulting in a social burden and economic costs. We developed a three-dimensional knitted fabric (3-DKF) with a pressure-reducing function that can be applied topically in the early stages of pressure ulcers to prevent progression.Methods We evaluated the effects of the 3-DKF in a streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus pressure ulcer mouse model, and the fabric was preliminarily applied to patients. Twelve-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were used for the animal experiments. In the pressure ulcer mouse model, an ischemia-reperfusion injury was created using a magnet on the dorsa of the mice. Pressure was measured with BodiTrak before and after applying the 3-DKF to 14 patients at risk of sacral pressure ulcers.Results In the 3-DKF-applied mice group, the ulcers were shallower and smaller than those in the control group. Compared with the mice in the control group, the 3-DKF group had lower platelet-derived growth factor-α and neutrophil elastase expression, as parameters related to inflammation, and increased levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, TGF-β3, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and α-smooth muscle actin, which are related to growth factors and proliferation. Additionally, typical normal tissue staining patterns were observed in the 3-DKF group. In the preliminary clinical analysis, the average skin pressure was 26.2 mm Hg before applying the 3-DKF, but it decreased to an average of 23.4 mm Hg after 3-DKF application.Conclusion This study demonstrated that the newly developed 3-DKF was effective in preventing pressure ulcers through testing in a pressure ulcer animal model and preliminary clinical application."

Hybrid Model for Renewable Energy and Load Forecasting Based on Data Mining and EWT,2022,"['Renewable resource', 'Load', 'Empirical wavelet transform', 'Improved random forest', 'Prediction level', 'Accommodation']",,"Accurate renewable resource (RES) and load prediction play key roles in the power grid planning schemes, eff ective dispatch, and stable operation of power systems. The proportions of wind and solar energy continue to increase, leading to wind and light abandonment. Thus, the absorption of wind and photovoltaic power is particularly important. On the basis of accurately predicting load, wind power and photovoltaic output, the accommodation capacity of wind and photovoltaic power is analyzed. The work contains fi ve parts, as follows: (1) empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is used to decompose wind power and load. At the same time, isolated forest (iForest) and fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) are used to process photovoltaic data. (2) Low frequency and intermediate frequency components of load are predicted by improved random forest (IRF). High frequency component of load is clustered by improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (IDBSCAN). The processing model is selected on the basis of the characteristics of each class sample. Each component of wind power are predicted by IRF. (3) Photovoltaic power of each category is predicted by IRF. (4) Diff erent components of load and wind power data are added. The photovoltaic power forecast data are synthesized according to the time point. (5) The forecast value of load, wind power, and photovoltaic output of a city are comprehensively evaluated by the summarized prediction level indicators. Three accommodation indicators are used for analyzing the accommodation capacity of wind power and photovoltaic. Results show that the forecasting methods of load, wind power, and photovoltaic power can generate better forecasting results than conventional methods. The analysis results of supplementary prediction level and accommodation indices provide reference for eff ective grid dispatching, sustainable, and healthy energy development."
Deformation of the ink roller of an offset press based on a simplified model of ink-rubber viscoelasticity,2022,"['Damping', 'Laplace transform', 'Stiffness', 'State space', 'Viscoelasticity']",,"Ink transfer is achieved by the squeezing and rotation of two rollers, one of which is a roller coated with a viscoelastic rubber layer. In this study, the force caused by ink hydrodynamic pressure on the rubber roller during the rotation is considered, the viscoelasticity of ink and rubber is equivalently substituted by spring-damping unit, and a rolling squeezing theoretical model of two rollers is established to study the node deformation of the rubber roller.The validity of the theoretical model is verified by experiments. Results show that the deformation of the rubber roller is greatly affected by the roller rotational speed, rubber layer thickness, and nip width. The rotational speed and nip width have a significant influence on the stiffness– damping of the ink layer and the ink force, and the rubber layer thickness has a remarkable effect on the squeezing deformation between the rollers."
Improving communication protocols in smart cities with transformers,2022,"['Vanets', 'ALOHA', 'Machine learning', 'LSTM', 'Transformers']",,"Adaptive medium access control (MAC) protocols are essential in the context of Vehicular AdHoc Networks (Vanets) because of the rapid changes in topology caused by the high mobility of nodes. In this work, we propose an adaptive version of the Slotted-ALOHA (S-ALOHA) protocol, where the transmission probability is constantly adjusted based on estimates of the number of vehicles in the coverage area. These values are computed using deep learning models for time series prediction. One challenge for implementing this approach is that the inputs to the models are noisy since they are also estimates based on the protocol’s operation itself. To address this problem, we propose a new training scheme where we add noise, similar to that produced by the protocol’s operation, to the inputs of the training examples as a form of regularization. Our experiments show that the regularized models perform close to the theoretical optimal where the number of vehicles in the area is always known."
A Real Time Traffic Flow Model Based on Deep Learning,2022,"['Real-time traffic data', 'Data flow model', 'Data model', 'deep learning', 'path topology', 'traffic flow', 'State discrimination algorithm']",,"Urban development has brought about the increasing saturation of urban traffic demand, and traffic congestion has become the primary problem in transportation. Roads are in a state of waiting in line or even congestion, which seriously affects people's enthusiasm and efficiency of travel. This paper mainly studies the discrete domain path planning method based on the flow data. Taking the traffic flow data based on the highway network structure as the research object, this paper uses the deep learning theory technology to complete the path weight determination process, optimizes the path planning algorithm, realizes the vehicle path planning application for the expressway, and carries on the deployment operation in the highway company. The path topology is constructed to transform the actual road information into abstract space that the machine can understand. An appropriate data structure is used for storage, and a path topology based on the modeling background of expressway is constructed to realize the mutual mapping between the two. Experiments show that the proposed method can further reduce the interpolation error, and the interpolation error in the case of random missing is smaller than that in the other two missing modes. In order to improve the real-time performance of vehicle path planning, the association features are selected, the path weights are calculated comprehensively, and the traditional path planning algorithm structure is optimized. It is of great significance for the sustainable development of cities."
An Integrated Production and Distribution Planning Model in Shrimp Agroindustry Supply Chain,2022,"['Shrimp Agroindustry', 'Supply Chain', 'Production Planning', 'Distribution', 'NSGA-II']",,"This study discusses the integration model of production and distribution planning in the shrimp agroindustry supply chain, consisting of four echelons: shrimp suppliers, shrimp agroindustry, logistics provider companies, and buyers. The shrimp agroindustry supply chain is an essential part of the supply chain of processed product food, which transforms raw shrimp into various processed shrimp frozen products. One form of collaboration between supply chain actors is the integration of production and distribution planning activities. A model is developed to determine the flow of goods from each echelon, the number of processed shrimp products in the agroindustry, and the supplies of processed shrimp products. The bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming is proposed to describe the characteristics of the problem to minimize the total supply chain costs and maximize service level. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is designed to solve the shrimp agroindustry supply chain problem. The sample problem from the shrimp agroindustry in East Java, Indonesia, is applied to exhibit an algorithm’s efficiency. The result shows the best solution for the total supply chain is 1.75 trillion, and the service level is 1,502,264.5."
Unified coordination control strategy for DC solid‑state transformer in DC microgrid,2022,"['DC microgrid', 'DC solid state transformer (DCSST)', 'Bus voltage', 'Coordinated control']",,"The existing control strategies of DC solid-state transformer (DCSST) are based on DC distribution system, which is mainly concentrated on one side voltage stability control without considering the change of control objectives under different conditions. Thus, they are unsuitable for multiterminal and multisource DC microgrid. The coordinated control strategy of DCSST in multiterminal and multisource DC microgrid is studied in this paper. The DCSST circuit models based on the series–parallel structure of dual active full bridge converter are established, and the basic control modes are analyzed: control low voltage mode and control high voltage mode. Combined with the characteristics of DC bus voltage fluctuation and the operation conditions of DCSST, a unified coordinated control strategy is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed control strategy can correctly identify the different power states of the two sides of the system, control the power exchange between the two sides of the system, and maintain the stable operation of the whole DC system."

Development and Validation of the Radiology Common Data Model (R-CDM) for the International Standardization of Medical Imaging Data,2022,"['Metadata', 'standardization', 'radiology information system']",,"Purpose: Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), a standard file format for medical imaging data, contains metadata describing each file. However, metadata are often incomplete, and there is no standardized format for recording metadata, leading to inefficiency during the metadata-based data retrieval process. Here, we propose a novel standardization method for DICOM metadata termed the Radiology Common Data Model (R-CDM).Materials and Methods: R-CDM was designed to be compatible with Health Level Seven International (HL7)/Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and linked with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM to achieve a seamless link between clinical data and medical imaging data. The terminology system was standardized using the RadLex playbook, a comprehensive lexicon of radiology. As a proof of concept, the R-CDM conversion process was conducted with 41.7 TB of data from the Ajou University Hospital. The R-CDM database visualizer was developed to visualize the main characteristics of the R-CDM database.Results: Information from 2801360 cases and 87203226 DICOM files was organized into two tables constituting the R-CDM. Information on imaging device and image resolution was recorded with more than 99.9% accuracy. Furthermore, OMOP-CDM and RCDM were linked to efficiently extract specific types of images from specific patient cohorts.Conclusion: R-CDM standardizes the structure and terminology for recording medical imaging data to eliminate incomplete and unstandardized information. Successful standardization was achieved by the extract, transform, and load process and image classifier. We hope that the R-CDM will contribute to deep learning research in the medical imaging field by enabling the securement of large-scale medical imaging data from multinational institutions."
Targeted thrombolysis by magnetoacoustic particles in photothrombotic stroke model,2022,"['Thrombolysis', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Photothrombosis', 'Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator (rtPA)', 'Controlled Release Drug Carriers']",,"Background: Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) has a short half-life, and additional hemorrhagic transformation (HT) can occur when treatment is delayed. Here, we report the design and thrombolytic performance of 3 μ m discoidal polymeric particles loaded with rtPA and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), referred to as rmDPPs, to address the HT issues of rtPA. Methods: The rmDPPs consisted of a biodegradable polymeric matrix, rtPA, and SPIONs and were synthesized via a top-down fabrication. Results: The rmDPPs could be concentrated at the target site with magnetic attraction, and then the rtPA could be released under acoustic stimulus. Therefore, we named that the particles had magnetoacoustic properties. For the in vitro blood clot lysis, the rmDPPs with magnetoacoustic stimuli could not enhance the lytic potential compared to the rmDPPs without stimulation. Furthermore, although the reduction of the infarcts in vivo was observed along with the magnetoacoustic stimuli in the rmDPPs, more enhancement was not achieved in comparison with the rtPA. A notable advantage of rmDPPs was shown in delayed administration of rmDPPs at poststroke. The late treatment of rmDPPs with magnetoacoustic stimuli could reduce the infarcts and lead to no additional HT issues, while rtPA alone could not show any favorable prognosis. Conclusion: The rmDPPs may be advantageous in delayed treatment of thrombotic patients."
Development and Validation of an Integrated Healthy Workplace Management Model in Taiwan,2022,"['Occupational safety and health', 'Taiwan', 'Validation', 'VPP']",,"Background: Impacts of exposure are generally monitored and recorded after injuries or illness occur.Yet, absence of conventional after-the-effect impacts (i.e., lagging indicators), tend to focus on physical health and injuries, and fail to inform if workers are not exposed to safety and health hazards. In contrast to lagging indicators, leading indicators are proactive, preventive, and predictive indexes that offer insights how effective safety and health. The present study is to validate an extended Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) that consists of six leading indicators.Methods: Questionnaires were distributed to 13 organizations (response rate ¼ 93.1%, 1,439 responses) in Taiwan. Cronbach a, multiple linear regression and canonical correlation were used to test the reliability of the extended Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) which consists of six leading indicators (safe climate, transformational leadership, organizational justice, organizational support, hazard prevention and control, and training). Criteria-related validation strategy was applied to examine relationships of six leading indicators with six criteria (perceived health, burnout, depression, job satisfaction, job performance, and life satisfaction).Results: The results showed that the Cronbach’s a of six leading indicators ranged from 0.87 to 0.92. The canonical correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between the six leading indicators and criteria (1st canonical function: correlation ¼ 0.647, square correlation ¼ 0.419, p < 0.001).Conclusions: The present study validates the extended VPP framework that focuses on promoting safety and physical and mental health. Results further provides applications of the extended VPP framework to promote workers’ safety and health."
Elite Polarization in South Korea: Evidence from a Natural Language Processing Model,2022,"['political polarization', 'elite polarization', 'natural language processing', 'BERT', 'text classification', 'South Korea']",,This study analyzes political polarization among the South Korean elite by examining 17 years’ worth of subcommittee meeting minutes from the South Korean National Assembly's standing committees. Its analysis applies various natural language processing techniques and the bidirectional encoder representations from the transformers model to measure and analyze polarization in the language used during these meetings. Its findings indicate that the degree of political polarization increased and decreased at various times over the study period but has risen sharply since the second half of 2016 and remained high throughout 2020. This result suggests that partisan political gaps between members of the South Korean National Assembly increase substantially.
Trade‐offs between male fertility reduction and selected growth factors or the klotho response in a lipopolysaccharide-dependent mouse model,2022,"['Antidepressant-like substances', 'LPS', 'Growth factors', 'Klotho', 'Testis']",,"The increasing number of depression cases leads to a greater need for new antidepressant treatment development. It is postulated that antidepressants may harm male fertility, but the cellular mechanism is still poorly understood. The role of growth factors and klotho protein in maintaining normal male reproductive function is well documented. Hence, the study aimed to investigate the effect of the antidepressant drug – imipramine (tricyclic AD), and other substances with antidepressant potential (ALS), administered in combination or in combination with LPS (an animal model of depression) on gene expression and protein synthesis of IGF-2 (insulin-like growth factor 2), TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor β1), NGF (nerve growth factor), KGF (keratinocyte growth factor) and protein synthesis of VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor A), IGF-IR (insulin-like growth factor receptor 1), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and klotho in the testis of mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with selected ALS and LPS or 10% DMSO (controls) (n = 7/group) once a day for 14 days. Animals were decapitated and testes collected for RNA and protein purification. PCR and western blot methods were employed for the evaluation of growth factors and klotho expression. The results obtained indicated a decreased level of most of the analyzed genes and proteins, except KGF; its expression increased after treatment with MTEP and IMI administrated individually and after NS-398, and IMI in combination with LPS. Our results may suggest that the tested ALS and LPS can contribute to a reduction of male fertility, but NS-398, IMI, and IMI+NS-398 may also act as stimulants after LPS."
Mesenchymal Stem Cells Attenuate Asthmatic Inflammation and Airway Remodeling by Modulating Macrophages/Monocytes in the IL-13-Overexpressing Mouse Model,2022,"['Asthma', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Macrophages', 'Monocytes', 'Interleukin-13']",,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attractive alternatives to conventional anti-asthmatic drugs for severe asthma. Mechanisms underlying the anti-asthmatic effects of MSCs have not yet been elucidated. This study evaluated the anti-asthmatic effects of intravenously administered MSCs, focusing on macrophages and monocytes. Seven-week-old transgenic (Tg) mice with lung-specific overexpression of IL-13 were used to simulate chronic asthma. MSCs were intravenously administered four days before sampling. We examined changes in immune cell subpopulations, gene expression, and histological phenotypes. IL-13 Tg mice exhibited diverse features of chronic asthma, including severe type 2 inflammation, airway fibrosis, and mucus metaplasia. Intravenous administration of MSCs attenuated these asthmatic features just four days after a single treatment. MSC treatment significantly reduced SiglecF-CD11c-CD11b+ monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMs) and inhibited the polarization of MoMs into M2 macrophages, especially M2a and M2c. Furthermore, MSCs downregulated the excessive accumulation of Ly6c- monocytes in the lungs. While an intravenous adoptive transfer of Ly6c- monocytes promoted the infiltration of MoM and Th2 inflammation, that of MSC-exposed Ly6c- monocytes did not. Ex vivo Ly6c- MoMs upregulated M2-related genes, which were reduced by MSC treatment. Molecules secreted by Ly6c- MoMs from IL-13 Tg mice lungs upregulated the expression of fibrosis-related genes in fibroblasts, which were also suppressed by MSC treatment. In conclusion, intravenously administered MSCs attenuate asthma phenotypes of chronic asthma by modulating macrophages. Identifying M2 macrophage subtypes revealed that exposure to MSCs transforms the phenotype and function of macrophages. We suggest that Ly6c- monocytes could be a therapeutic target for asthma management."

Especially, we developed extended models that could take into account covariate measurement errors along with various distribution of outcome variables(normal distribution, binomial distribution, and Poisson distribution). Chandra, Aditya, Kumar(2018) proposed a log-transformed small area model that could take into consideration outcome variables in asymmetric forms rather than normal distribution bigger than 0, but this model can not consider  covariate measurement errors. In this study, we extend the log-transformed small area model that could take into account measurement errors of covariates. The measurement error model is divided into a functional measurement error model that assumes non-stochastic on the true value of covariates and a structural measurement error model that assumes stochasticity. In this study, a structural measurement error model was considered. Hierarchical Bayesian estimation is used, which is based on Gibbs sampling as a method of MCMC(Markov chain Monte Carlo), to estimate model fitting and parameters.

가우스-헬머트 모델 전최소제곱: 평면방정식과 측지좌표계 변환,2022,['-'],,"The conventional LESS (LEast-Squares Solution) is calculated under the assumption that there is no errors in independent variables. However, the coordinates of a point, either from traditional ground surveying such as slant distances, horizontal and/or vertical angles, or GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) positioning, cannot be determined independently (and the components are correlated each other). Therefore, the TLS (Total Least Squares) adjustment should be applied for all applications related to the coordinates. Many approaches were suggested in order to solve this problem, resulting in equivalent solutions except some restrictions. In this study, we calculated the normal vector of the 3D plane determined by the trace of the VLBI targets based on TLS within GHM (Gauss-Helmert Model). Another numerical test was conducted for the estimation of the Helmert transformation parameters. Since the errors in the horizontal components are very small compared to the radius of the circle, the final estimates are almost identical. However, the estimated variance components are significantly reduced as well as show a different characteristic depending on the target location. The Helmert transformation parameters are estimated more precisely compared to the conventional LESS case. Furthermore, the residuals can be predicted on both reference frames with much smaller magnitude (in absolute sense)."

글로벌 금융위기 이후 중국 발전모델의 변화: 반도체 산업정책 사례,2022,"['China', 'semiconductor', 'industrial policy', 'development model', 'trade war', '중국', '반도체', '산업정책', '발전모델', '무역전쟁']","이 글은 중국의 반도체 산업정책의 분석을 통해 글로벌 금융위기 이후 중국 발전모델의 변화를 평가한다. 1978년 개혁개 방 이전 중국 반도체 산업은 사회주의 계획경제 정책에 따라 발전해 왔다. 1970년대 말 개혁개방 이후 중국 반도체 산업은 미국, 일본, 대만 및 한국 기업을 적극적으로 유치하였다. 2008년 글로벌금융위기 이후 중국은 독자적으로 반도체 산업을 개발하는 방향으로 선회하였다. 2013년 집권한 시진핑 정부는 반도체 산업의 수입대체를 본격적으로 추진하였다. 정부는 대규모 기금을 조성해 반도체 기술 개발을 직접 지원하는 것은 물론 해외기술을 습득하기 위한 인재 유치와 기술협력에도 관여하였다. 이러한 노력에도 불구하고 반도체 자급률은 크게 상승하지 못했으며 기술 격차도 비약적으로 축소되지 않았 다. 산업정책의 목표에 미달한 것은 시진핑 정부가 도입한 발전모델의 한계로 해석될 수 있다. 수입대체 전략은 장기적 발 전을 위한 연구개발 투자보다는 단기적으로 성과를 거둘 수 있는 장비 도입과 전문가 영입에 치중하였다. 또한, 중앙 정부 와 충분한 조율 없이 여러 지방 정부가 산업정책을 개별적으로 추진함으로써 자원과 인력이 효율적으로 활용되지 못하는 부작용이 발생하였다. 무역전쟁 발발 이후 미국의 대중 제재는 산업정책의 효과를 반감시켰다. 미국의 제재로 중국 기업은 첨단기업의 인수합병은 물론 주요 장비와 소프트웨어를 구매하거나 사용할 수 없게 되었다. 결론적으로 글로벌 금융위기 이후 시진핑 정부가 추진한 반도체 산업정책은 대내적 한계와 대외적 압박 때문에 성공하지 못했다. 반도체 산업의 장기적 성장을 이룩하지 못했다는 사실을 고려하면, 시진핑 정부의 발전모델은 발전국가보다는 국가자본주의에 더 부합하는 것 으로 평가될 수 있다.","This article evaluates the transformation of China’s development model after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 by analyzing the semiconductor industrial policy. Before the reform and opening-up policy in 1978, the industry had developed in accordance with the socialist planned economy policy. Subsequently, the industry has adopted a strategy to actively attract US, Japanese, Taiwanese, and Korean companies. As China’s economic rise began in earnest after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, the Xi Jinping government, which took power in 2013, promoted an import-substitution policy. The government directly supported the development of semiconductor technology by creating large-scale funds, and was involved in attracting talent and technology cooperation to acquire overseas technology. Despite these efforts, the semiconductor self-sufficiency rate did not rise significantly, and the technology gap did not narrow significantly. The failure of the semiconductor industry policy can be interpreted as a limitation of the development model introduced by the government. The state-led model, which aims to support import-substitution, focused on introducing equipments and recruiting experts that can achieve results in the short term rather than investing in research and development for long-term development. In addition, as local governments, which are not controlled by the central government, promoted industrial policies in their own capacity, side effects occurred where resources and manpower could not be efficiently utilized. Since the outbreak of the trade war, U.S. sanctions against China have halved the effectiveness of the industrial policy. The trade war acted as an obstacle to industrial policy. Due to U.S. sanctions on the semiconductor industry, Chinese companies are not allowed to purchase major equipment and software as well as mergers and acquisitions of high-tech companies. Therefore, the development model promoted by the Xi administration after the Global Financial Crisis failed due to internal limitations and external pressures. Unlike Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, China has not achieved long-term growth in the semiconductor industry. The development model can be evaluated as more in line with state capitalism than developmental state."

Affinity Prober를 이용한 언어 모델의 문장 수용성 판단 결정의 경계 요인 분석,2022,"['Transformer', 'BERT', 'Self Attention', 'Minimal pair', 'Linguistic acceptability']",,"Recently, many studies endeavor to reveal the intrinsic nature of BERT, since transformer-based language models have achieved the state-of-the-art in many natural language understanding tasks. However, it is still hard to probe BERT’s universal linguistic properties since different probing methods lead to fluctuating results between tasks and models. Thus, this paper suggests Affinity Prober, which is a flexible task- and model-agnostic probing method to investigate transformer-based language model’s decision boundaries when processing linguistic phenomena. Affinity Prober is designed to investigate potential linguistic knowledge from the Self Attention Mechanism. Using Affinity Prober, the study examines whether a bert-base-cased model has any explainable decision boundaries on sentence acceptability in terms of a lexical category in English. The results in syntactic phenomena show that the Affinity Relationship between function words is reinforced in the upper layers, while the Affinity Relationship between content words plays a key role in semantic phenomena. The study concludes that Affinity Prober is helpful to analyze the model’s decision boundary with lexical categories on specific linguistic phenomena."

Most existing methods for hair removal are based on image processing, but their performance tends to be significantly degraded in hairy skin images. As an alternative, an image inpainting approach based on deep learning can be taken into account, while few deep learning models for hair removal have been reported due to the lack of datasets. In this paper, we evaluate the applicability of BAT-Fill which is a transformer-based deep learning model as an image inpainting method for hair removal in skin images. BAT-Fill consists of not only the coarse network based on bidirectional autoregressive transformers but also the refinement network based on generative adversarial network (GAN). While a typical process of image inpainting is to progressively fill the inner hidden block using the properties of neighbor pixels, it is challenging to accurately extract the skin properties of neighbor pixels when hairs are largely distributed. The transformer is a solution for reconstructing the skin texture by learning the similarity of pixel properties between two distant areas, where local skin textures can be accurately predicted using global skin properties. The model assessment shows that BAT-Fill is effective to enhance the perceptual quality of the hair-removed image as it exhibits significant improvement in FID although it does not in PSNR and SSIM."
팬옵틱 분할을 위한 고속 트랜스포머,2022,"['Panoptic segmentation', 'Transformer']",,"Recent high-performance panoptic segmentation models are based on transformer architectures. However, transformer-based panoptic segmentation methods are basically slower than convolution-based methods, since the attention mechanism in the transformer requires quadratic complexity w.r.t. image resolution. Also, sine and cosine computation for positional embedding in the transformer also yields a bottleneck for computation time. To address these problems, we adopt three modules to speed up the inference runtime of the transformer-based panoptic segmentation. First, we perform channel-level reduction using depth-wise separable convolution for inputs of the transformer decoder. Second, we replace sine and cosine-based positional encoding with convolution operations, called conv-embedding. We also apply a separable self-attention to the transformer encoder to lower quadratic complexity to linear one for numbers of image pixels. As result, the proposed model achieves 44% faster frame per second than baseline on ADE20K panoptic validation dataset, when we use all three modules."

To alleviate this problem, ensemble techniques that combine trading algorithms have been proposed. However, there are several problems with this ensemble method. First, the trading algorithm may not be selected so as to satisfy the minimum performance requirement (more than random) of the algorithm included in the ensemble, which is a necessary requirement of the ensemble. Second, there is no guarantee that an ensemble model that performed well in the past will perform well in the future. In order to solve these problems, a method for selecting trading algorithms included in the ensemble model is proposed as follows. Based on past data, we measure the contribution of the trading algorithms included in the ensemble models with high performance. However, for contributions based only on this historical data, since there are not enough past data and the uncertainty of the past data is not reflected, the contribution distribution is approximated using the Dirichlet distribution, and the contribution values are sampled from the contribution distribution to reflect the uncertainty. Based on the contribution distribution of the trading algorithm obtained from the past data, the Transformer is trained to predict the future contribution. Trading algorithms with high predicted future contribution are selected and included in the ensemble model. Through experiments, it was proved that the proposed ensemble method showed superior performance compared to the existing ensemble methods."

However, it is difficult to find a small object in the image mainly due to the flaw of the most of visual recognition networks. Because visual recognition networks are mostly convolution neural network which usually consider local features. So, we make a model considering not only local feature, but also global feature. In this paper, we propose a detection method of a small marker on the object using deep learning and an algorithm that considers global features by combining Transformer’s self-attention technique with a convolutional neural network. We suggest a self-attention model with new definition of Query, Key and Value for model to learn global feature and simplified equation by getting rid of position vector and classification token which cause the model to be heavy and slow.

By combining with machine learning, the accuracy of pose estimation has been greatly improved. However, the image-based approach has a limitation in that it is difficult to estimate pose when part or whole of the body is occluded by obstacles or when the lighting is dark. Recently, studies have emerged to estimate a human pose using wireless signals, which have the advantage of penetrating obstacles without being affected by brightness. The previous stereotype was that two or more pairs of transceivers are required to estimate a specific location based on wireless signals. This paper shows that it is possible to estimate the human pose and to perform body segmentation by applying deep learning only with 1x1 ultra wide band signals collected by 1×1 transceiver. We also propose a method of replacing convolution neural networks and showing better performance through transformer models."

Repeated exposure to allergens of the respiratory tract causes chronic inflammation, followed by structural changes in the lung called airway remodeling. House dust mites (HDM) are known as the predominant inhalant allergens, and several studies have reported that the allergenic property of HDM extracts varied with the geographic regions where they were produced. This study aimed to establish a murine experimental model by long-term intranasal exposure to HDM allergen indigenous to Korea.Methods: HDM extracts from cultured Dermatophagoides pteronissunus in Korea were used in our model. We administered the extracts intranasally to BALB/c mice 3 times a week for 8 or 10 consecutive weeks, followed by measuring airway allergic inflammation and airway remodeling.Results: The number of neutrophils in the lungs was higher in the group with long-term exposure to HDM than in the normal control group. The levels of total IgE and a wide range of cytokines, including Th1/Th2/Th17 and proinflammatory cytokines, were significantly higher in the long-term HDM-exposed group than in the normal control group. The development of airway remodeling by chronic exposure to HDM was observed by measuring diverse factors, including collagens and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β.

The emergence of internet-only banks, open banking, financial regulatory sandbox and other innovative financial policy are serving as the gateway for big tech companies. Building up on the core service named “payment service”, these companies have made a success with asset management, insurance, credit scoring, etc., providing consumers with an unprecedented level of simplicity in financial experiences.Big techs are offering innovative services tailored to customers’ needs based on DNA loop, and as a distribution channel for financial products, they are playing a key part in making the conventional payment market increasingly competitive with efficient banking services. Not only does this pose a great threat to the industry, including banks, but it also presents huge challenges ranging from issues related to consumer protection, side-effects to managing payment system risks.Looking into where Big Techs stand in the payment market, this paper is attempting to propose Big Tech’s deposit protection model that could address consumer protection issues and reduce side-effects of their presence. In the section covering the current state of Big Techs, provision of financial services by global Big Tech companies, stories behind success of their financial services (DNA loop), and transformation of financial industry’s landscape fueled by the advent of them will be discussed. In addition, we will also assess how far discussion on consumer protection has progressed at home and abroad against the backdrop of failures of domestic and international Big techs. Lastly, the paper will propose a model that could improve Big techs’ protection of consumers with a focus on consumer deposits, among other financial service models.How Big techs should protect consumers should continue to be brought up going forward, and it is a matter to be addressed through a social consensus. Discussing ways to strengthen consumer protection while encouraging innovative financial services through academic papers, exchanging views with the industry and other research methods will prove to be meaningful, particularly at this time."

However, distribution inequality occurs, and a large percentage of vaccine production has been transported to high-income countries. These harms happened even though nations or institutions did not intend to injury a particular group or state, and it was difficult to hold anyone responsible, resulting in these issues being ignored by the many who did not suffer.

순간적인 화학물질 누출에 따른 초기 피해영향 범위 산정을 위한 분산모델 연구,2022,"['dispersion model', 'consequence analysis', 'diffusion coefficient', 'ethane release']",,"Most factories deal with toxic or flammable chemicals in their industrial processes. These hazardous substances pose a risk of leakage due to accidents, such as fire and explosion. In the event of chemical release, massive casualties and property damage can result; hence, quantitative risk prediction and assessment are necessary. Several methods are available for evaluating chemical dispersion in the atmosphere, and most analyses are considered neutral in dispersion models and under far-field wind condition. The foregoing assumption renders a model valid only after a considerable time has elapsed from the moment chemicals are released or dispersed from a source. Hence, an initial dispersion model is required to assess risk quantitatively and predict the extent of damage because the most dangerous locations are those near a leak source. In this study, the dispersion model for initial consequence analysis was developed with three-dimensional unsteady advective diffusion equation. In this expression, instantaneous leakage is assumed as a puff, and wind velocity is considered as a coordinate transform in the solution. To minimize the buoyant force, ethane is used as leaked fuel, and two different diffusion coefficients are introduced. The calculated concentration field with a molecular diffusion coefficient shows a moving circular iso-line in the horizontal plane. The maximum concentration decreases as time progresses and distance increases. In the case of using a coefficient for turbulent diffusion, the dispersion along the wind velocity direction is enhanced, and an elliptic iso-contour line is found. The result yielded by a widely used commercial program, ALOHA, was compared with the end point of the lower explosion limit. In the future, we plan to build a more accurate and general initial risk assessment model by considering the turbulence diffusion and buoyancy effect on dispersion."

It was referenced to feature map production. The RNN family of algorithms used in small CNN-RNN models are LSTM algorithms and GRU algorithms, which are usually stacked two to three times over 100 units, but in this paper, small RNNs consisting of 10 and 20 units are overlapped.

The experiment proved 86.4% the performance for the problem of predicting the main classes of enzyme number, and it was confirmed that the performance was 84.4% accurate up to the sub-sub classes of enzyme number.

Companies have various security solutions to reduce insider threats, but there is a limit to capturing all human behavior. To solve this problem, studies on the detection of insider threat behavior using deep learning are being actively conducted. However, two problems that attack data is very scarce due to the nature of insider threat behavior, and time and action data must be learned at the same time remain challenges. In this paper, we propose an insider threat behavior detection model using the mask language model, which is a pre-learning method of Bi-directional Encoder Representation of Transformer(BERT). We used a CERT dataset for learning and used a custom tokenizer to map the data to actions and times at 30-minute intervals. The characteristics were learned by inputting only normal data into the mask language model, and the sum of the loss values derived from normal data was calculated as a threat score, and the maximum value was set as a detection boundary for each user. After that, if the threat score that occurs when new data is put into the model exceeds the detection boundary, it was detected as an abnormal behavior. The experimental results showed that compared to existing deep learning models, the model reacted sensitively when the behavior occurred at an unusual time, and in the case of scenarios where preparation and initiation of threat behavior were separated, appropriate detection performance was considered. As a result, the unbalanced dataset which was a challenge of detecting insider threat behavior could use the large amount of normal data as an advantage. And unlike the existing LSTM derivatives, sufficiently detailed time data can be mapped to behavior and used for learning."

For this purpose, data for training and validation were generated through preprocessing and augmentation of color contact lens images, using CNN technologies such as ResNet101, GoogLeNet V2, GoogLeNet V4, DenseNet121, MobileNet compared and analyzed the defect detection rate for each RGB channel and HSV channel. The accuracies of the above models are 89.74%, 84.46%, 95.43%, 82.80%, and 89.74% respectively, with GoogLeNet V4 on the RGB channel having the highest defect detection accuracy, and in most models, the RGB channel is higher than the HSV channel."
RF 트랜스포머를 사용한 광대역 전력증폭기 설계,2022,"['Amplifiers', 'RF transformer', 'Broadband', 'inter-stage matching network', 'Fractional bandwidth']",,"In this paper, a two-stage single-ended power amplifier (PA) with broadband gain characteristics was presented by utilizing a radio frequency (RF) transformer (TF), which is essential for a differential amplifier. The bandwidth of a PA can be improved by designing TF to have broadband characteristics and then applying it to the inter-stage matching network (IMN) of a PA. For broadband gain characteristics while maintaining the performance and area of the existing PA, an IMN was implemented on an monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) and a multi-layer printed circuit board (PCB), and the simulation results were compared. As a result of simulating the PA module designed using InGaP/GaAs HBT model, it has been confirmed that the PA employing the proposed design method has an improved fractional bandwidth of 19.8% at a center frequency of 3.3GHz, while the conventional PA showed that of 11.2%."

As the result, the ‘metaverse’, which mediates the virtual world realized through computer graphics and real life, has been established as a new digital earth and a new normal ecosystem centering on Generation Z. In particular, interaction between users through ‘avatar’ in the virtual world is replaced by another communication method and play culture, and almost all daily activities such as classes, meetings, shopping, and performance viewing have been implemented in the metaverse. Accordingly, the avatar acts as a major medium to express the upgraded ‘I’ of a more extended dimension, and its value and scope of use has been expanded in all directions.This unprecedented new level of social relationships promotes online and offline hyperconnection and independent virtual economy activities, and is driving the development of promising industries related to avatars in the metaverse. It is at this intersection that a powerful junction between the metaverse, avatar, and the fashion industry has occurred. At present, global fashion brands are using the metaverse platform as a major publicity tool or setting it as an insight source to establish brand innovation values, and are conducting virtual/reality linking projects to secure future loyal customers.In this study, metaverse platforms <ZEPETO>, <Gather, Animal Crossing>, and <Roblox> selected by various global fashion brands were selected as major research topics, and specific examples of collaboration between fashion brands and the metaverse platform were presented.Furthermore, after analyzing and comparing the above platforms into nine components of the ‘Business Model Canvas’, meaningful points of use of fashion brands for each metaverse platform were systematized. At the end of the study, by synthesizing the implications derived from this process, specific practical guidelines for setting up a level of advancement strategy and development direction applicable to future fashion brands in the metaverse were suggested."

In this premise, this study aims to examine the possibilities and limitations of the natural sciences, including neuroscience, on the premise of the emergence of the post-human self. On the one hand, the posthuman age of science and technology claims the annihilation of the self, but on the other hand, it talks about the transformational persistence of the self, not the extinction of the self. What is at issue is the danger of technological self-reconstruction that denies or ignores this viability. The self in the posthuman era presented by Thomas Metzinger perceives the world based on the human body. In other words, the brain's self-formation process works with the empirical world model that occurs through an interaction with the meaning components of human life. The ego, which exists while being influenced by and interacting with the external world, accepts all of its internal and external ontological environmental conditions, and at the same time generates a feeling of 'I' through it. Thus, the self can be ‘experienced’ but does not actually ‘exist’. This model asserts the transformation and relativity of the ego, unlike the absoluteness of the ego that traditional humanism maintains. From this point of view, this study accepts the extinction of the traditional humanism-based self, and at the same time attempts to examine the inherent dangers of the scientific and technological reprocessing of self-consciousness asserted by science and technology centralism."

A model with a moving boundary can be easily found in a long span retractable roof, and it corresponds to a problem of a non-cylindrical domain in which the boundary moves with time. In particular, a motion equation of a shallow arch having a moving boundary is expressed in the form of an integral-differential equation. This is expressed by the time-varying integration interval of the integral coefficient term in the arch equation with an un-movable boundary. Also, the change in internal force due to the moving boundary is also considered. Therefore, in this study, the governing equation was derived by transforming the equation of the non-cylindrical domain into the cylindrical domain to solve this problem. A governing equation for vertical vibration was derived from the transformed equation, where a sinusoidal function was used as the orthonormal basis. Terms that consider the effect of the moving boundary over time in the original equation were added in the equation of the transformed cylindrical problem. In addition, a solution was obtained using a numerical analysis technique in a symmetric mode arch system, and the result effectively reflected the effect of the moving boundary."

The performance of two PLMs – BART and GPT – at the task of abstractive text summarization was compared. To investigate how performance depends on the characteristics of the inference data, ten different document types, containing six types of informational content and creation content, were considered. It was found that BART (which can both generate and understand natural language) performed better than GPT (which can only generate). Upon more detailed examination of the effect of inference data characteristics, the performance of GPT was found to be proportional to the length of the input text. However, even for the longest documents (with optimal GPT performance), BART still out-performed GPT, suggesting that the greatest influence on downstream performance is not the size of the training data or PLMs parameters but the structural suitability of the PLMs for the applied downstream task. The performance of different PLMs was also compared through analyzing parts of speech (POS) shares. BART’s performance was inversely related to the proportion of prefixes, adjectives, adverbs and verbs but positively related to that of nouns. This result emphasizes the importance of taking the inference data’s characteristics into account when fine-tuning a PLMs for its intended downstream task."

However, the whole process is intrinsically slow and considerably affected by the inner physicochemical properties of the wasteand other surrounding conditions, which makes optimization of the process difficult. The most promising options to counter thismassive generation of waste are eco-friendly treatments or recycling. As a preliminary step for these options, attempts were madeto evaluate the feasibility and usability of three simulative models based on reaction kinetics. Model (A) predicted relativechanges over reaction time for reactant, intermediate, and product. Overall, an increased reaction rate produced less intermediateand more product, thereby leading to a shorter total reaction time. Particle diminishing model (B) predicted reduction of the totalwaste mass. The smaller particles diminished faster along with the dominant effect of microbial reaction. In Model (C),long-chain cellulose was predicted to transform into reducing sugar. At a standard condition, 48% of cellulose molecules having105repeating units turned into reducing sugar after 100 h.

In order to overcome such a crisis, this study proposes that entrepreneurship is need even in the agricultural arena. The essence of the entrepreneurial process is interaction between the entrepreneur and opportunity. Authenticity of the entrepreneur is hard to be kept through the process because of the environmental and market changes. To adapt to the environment, the paradox management are required to meet the diverse stakeholders and effectiveness. Entrepreneurity is archetypical in the agriculture where the 1st industrial revolution occurred. It is potential source of entrepreneurship so that the attitude, attributes, and abilities to recognize and resolve the problems in the field with learning efforts. The agricultural entrepreneurs are those who implement entrepreneurial spirit in the agriculture and combines the traditional agricultural practice with the entrepreneurial spirit. The agricultural entrepreneurs combine these two aspects have been considered contradictory or incompatible. This study reviews various alternative approaches to the traditional agriculture, and introduces a case study on successful entrepreneurship in the field of livestock industry. A Farm started the poultry farming and has accumulated experience for over 20 years before he started pig farming in 1989. After nine-years research, he invented novel assorted feedstuff. In the five cooperative units, A Farm raise pigs with the invented feedstuff and supplies the pork through over 50 chain distributors. Due to efforts and contribution to the livestock industry, the farm received awards and recognitions from Korean government. The case study of A Farm shows how the traditional way of livestock industry can be transformed into a new business model with archetypical entrepreneurity. In the agricultural entrepreneurship, archetypical OCEAN entrepreneurity model is developed composed of 10 characteristics in 5 dimensions: Originality, Openness, Curiosity, Creativity, Empathy, Engagement, Authenticity, Adaptability, Negativity to the negatives, and Nexus. Based on the discussion, the academic and practical implications are discussed and several research directions for the future are proposed."

However, the conventional control technique for a grid-connected mode in the TAB converter cannot maintain its reliability for an islanding mode under a blackout situation. In this paper, the islanding mode control technique is proposed to solve this issue. To verify the relative stability and dynamic characteristics of the control technique, small-signal models of both the grid connected and the islanding mode are derived. Based on the small-signal models, PI controllers are designed to provide suitable power control. The proposed control technique, the accuracy of small-signal models, and the performance of the controllers are verified by simulations and experiments with a 1-kW prototype TAB converter."

However, in order to express the manufacturing facility in a virtual space, design data of the manufacturing facility is required, but soft objects such as pneumatic pipes and wires are often omitted during the machine design stage. To solve this problem, additional design personnel are required, and the piping data generated through the existing machine design program occupies a large number of unnecessary resources in terms of optimization. To address this problem, this work presents a method for modeling pneumatic piping directly through sweep-based modeling inside Unity, which is widely used in the field of digital twin research. In this paper, we easily set the transit point of pneumatic piping using the transform object provided by Unity, and generate a spline curve through objectification of the transit point. In addition, the shape of the cross-section and the number of division points of the entire path can be freely set, so that the degree of optimization of the rendering process can be adjusted. One of the challenges of constructing a digital twin is expected to be effective in solving by this method, allowing simulation workers to freely add and modify missing objects in the pre-design stage."

Related researchers have pointed out that the conceptual definition of science culture is insufficient (Schiele et al., 2021). According to previous studies, science culture grows by exchanging influences with social culture, which is related to the democratization of science and scientific innovation. The Quebec Science and Technology Culture Research Report (CST, 2002) emphasized the social meaning of science culture by presenting that as ""the science and technology knowledge and capabilities acquired and used by citizens and society"". Godin and Gingras (2000) regarded science culture as the fundamental way of life, so defined science culture as ""the expression of all the models through which individuals and society appropriate science and technology"". Recently, an international collaboration to understand science culture was initiated. This paper examines what concepts of science culture have been proposed thus far and draws definitions of it that can be useful in our society. The concept “term definition” does not simply give a dictionary definition but indicates a shift in perspective on science culture, which can be a starting point for future discourse on related institutionalization."

We investigated whether and how discourse expectations demonstrated in the psycholinguistics literature are manifested in neural language models, using the language models whose architectures and assumptions are considered most appropriate for the given language processing tasks. We first attempted to perform a general assessment of a neural model’s discourse expectations about story continuity or coherence (Experiment 1), based on the next sentence prediction module of the bidirectional transformer-based model BERT (Devlin et al. 2019). We also studied language models’ expectations about reference continuity in discursive contexts in both comprehension (Experiment 2) and production (Experiment 3) settings, based on so-called Implicit Causality biases. We used the unidirectional (or left-to-right) RNN-based model LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and the transformer-based generation model GPT-2 (Radford et al. 2019), respectively. The results of the three experiments showed, first, that neural language models are highly successful in distinguishing between reasonably expected and unexpected story continuations in human communication and also that they exhibit human-like bias patterns in reference expectations in both comprehension and production contexts. The results of the present study suggest language models can closely simulate the discourse processing features observed in psycholinguistic experiments with human speakers. The results also suggest language models can, beyond simply functioning as a technology for practical purposes, serve as a useful research tool and/or object for the study of human discourse processing."

This research makes theoretical endeavor to integrate the shadow of one’s soul constructively within supervision model.This research firmly claim that theoretical credibility and practical relevancy will be enhanced as the director’s shadow would be taken care of. It will be unfolding its argument as following. At first, It states that the supervision theory should be grounded on the Trinitarian dynamics as same as the spiritual direction for its Christian identity and spiritual formation. Secondly, It examine carefully the concept of the shadow in the self system within Jung’s analytic psychology and the way in which it could be explored, resolved and integrated with the soul of the director. At third, it attempts to suggest its significance through a practical description in which the shadow would be reflected, discerned and integrated within the inner dynamics and outer practice of the director and supervisor. In final, integrating the shadow of the soul into spiritual formation for supervision will be suggested as one of the essential goals for cultivating and taking care of the identity and spiritual transformation of spiritual director."
Analysis and Modeling of Longitudinal Deformation Profiles Considering the Reinforcement Effect of Tunnel Face in Weak Rocks,2022,"['Convergence-confinement method', 'Longitudinal deformation profiles', 'Tunnel face', 'Support design', 'Extrusion deformation']",,"Convergence-confinement method (CCM) has become a common method for tunnel design due to its simplicity and practicality. The ground reaction curve (GRC), the support characteristic curve (SCC) and the longitudinal deformation profile (LDP) are all considered in this method. One of these is the LDP, which serves as a unique identifier for the location of the tunnel support. The installation point of the tunnel support is one of the most important outcomes of the method. LDP is more impacted by the reinforcement of the tunnel face. However, more existing LDP calculation methods do not consider the reinforcement of the tunnel face. A study on methods for calculating LDP considering the tunnel face reinforcement was carried out to address this constraint of CCM. Firstly, the transformation of tunnel face extrusion deformation and pre-convergence deformation at the tunnel face is realized in accordance with equivalent volume. Then a model of LDP with the tunnel face extrusion deformation as the variable was established considering the tunnel face reinforcement effect. The proposed model's accuracy is assessed in comparison with other typical models. We conclude with parametric analyses concerning the tunnel face reinforcement's effects on the point of support installation, as well as convergence deformation of the tunnel. By taking into account tunnel faces' reinforcement effects, tunnel support design can be more accurate, and the construction costs can be reduced."
다중 합성곱 모델을 이용한 R-EPS 차량 내부 소음 예측,2022,"['Noise', 'in-vehicle Noise', 'Deep Learning', 'Acceleration Data', 'Electric Power Steering', 'Short-Term Fourier Transformation']",,"Because dealing with noises in automobile becomes more important, it is valuable to predict in-vehicle noise levels and use them for the product noise design. With the recent development of artificial intelligence, many studies have attempted to use deep learning models for various types of data generated in automobile industry. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to predict in-vehicle noise levels based on deep learning models. In this study, we propose a deep learning framework that can predict in-vehicle noise levels and identify the causes of noises. Our framework is developed to recognize in-vehicle noise levels with automobile acceleration data from various locations of electric power steering devices. Our deep learning framework consists of several convolutional neural backbone networks to extract representation vectors for each acceleration axis. In addition, acceleration data are converted into a spectrogram through the short-term Fourier transformation technique, and high frequency bands in the spectrogram are removed to better represent the input data. We demonstrated that our proposed framework is suitable for predicting in-vehicle noises and identifying the major causes of noises. We expect that the explanation for prediction results will be helpful in the design low-noise vehicles."

Surprise values are collected from the transformer GPT-2 and BERT language models. Reading time data for humans are taken from Lowder and Gordon’s (2021) eye-tracking experiment. According to Lowder and Gordon (ibid.) that take as a critical region the matrix verb after the RC in the subject position, for humans the locative PP contained in the RC register longer reading times ORCs than SRCs, while the temporal PP does so for SRCs than ORCs. By contrast, for the two neural LMs, surprisals are higher for ORCs than SRCs regardless of whether the PP in question is locative or temporal. There was no statistically significant linear fit between human and the LMs’ responses. The result shows that to the extent that the distinction between locative and temporal PPs in RCs is syntactico-semantic, neither of the two neural language models is able to acquire human-like sensitivity to such a distinction."
Neural Network Language Models as Psycholinguistic Subjects: Focusing on Reflexive Dependency,2022,"['reflexive dependency', 'filler-gap dependency', 'gender mismatch effect', 'neural network language model', 'surprisal']",,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the reflexive-antecedent dependency resolution accompanying the wh-filler-gap dependency resolution in neural network language models (LMs)’ sentence processing, comparing the processing result of LMs to the one of humans. To do so, we adopt the psycholinguistic methodology that Fraizer et al. (2015) used for humans. The neural-network language models employed in this study are four LMs: the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) trained on large datasets, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2 (GPT-2) trained on large datasets, an LSTM trained on small datasets (L2 datasets), and the GPT-2 trained on small datasets (L2 datasets). We found that only the LMs trained on large datasets were sensitive to the dependency between a reflexive and its antecedent matching in gender, but all of the four neural LMs failed to learn reflexive-antecedent dependency accompanying wh-filler-gap dependency. Furthermore, we also found that the neural LMs have a learning bias in gender mismatch."

Reading the different journeys of the text’s three main protagonists—Danny, Yongju, Jangmi—this paper argues that the model minority idea centralizes their transformation from refugees to citizens within the host countries. By internalizing and embodying the qualities expected of the model minority, these characters are considered deserving of new citizenship, as they support their host countries’ national values and identity. William Peterson’s understanding of “good citizenship” was suggested to understand and praise Asian Americans’ success despite their hardships as recent migrants. His notion established the Asian American model minority figure as hardworking but politically silent. The idea generates stereotypes, and isolates Asian Americans from society. Focusing on Peterson’s problematic notion, the paper will first explore how ​​each character within Lee’s novel embodies and performs an iteration of the model minority figure. In particular, Danny becomes a model US citizen, and Yongju represents a model North Korean refugee in South Korea. By comparison, Jangmi wishes to remain invisible, only hoping to forget the past. By examining why Jangmi’s different refugee experience prevents her from becoming a model North Korean refugee, this paper problematizes the model minority idea as exclusive and exclusionary. Further, this paper critiques how new citizens in host countries are burdened with pre-configurations of the model minority figure, and proposes that these both marginalize and oppressively silence difference and diversity."

Analytical modelling of 3D temperature evolution of Al 6061-T6 irradiated by a moving laser heat source considering intensive convective boundary conditions,2022,"['3D temperature prediction', 'Analytical modeling', 'Experiment', 'Laser line heating', 'Simulation']",,"The estimation of temperature evolution in a solid material irradiated by a highintensity laser beam is important for modelling of various laser-based heating processes. This paper proposes a three-dimensional analytical solution of temperature field based on the integral transform technique considering intensive convective boundary conditions. The proposed model evaluates the temperature of a laser-heated sheet as a function of geometric, material and laser attributes of the sheet. By comparing the findings of experimental investigation performed on 1.5 mm thick Al 6061-T6 sheets under the considered process conditions, the effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated. Laser power and scanning speed varied during the experiments keeping laser beam radius and specimen geometry constant. The surface temperature of the laser-heated sheet is found to rise with increasing laser power. In contrast, the surface temperature drops with high scan speeds. The analytical and experimental results are in close agreement with errors less than 3 %. Eventually, the temperature evolution predicted by the analytical solution is compared numerically and it is found that the analytical model can effectively reduce the computing time for evaluating the temperature in the laser heating process. To broaden the application of the analytical model, the effect of process parameters, namely, laser beam radius, workpiece thickness and material properties on the temperature evolution are analyzed under different cooling schemes. This investigation is of significance towards developing an inverse method for determining laser process parameters quickly and inexpensively for various laser-based heating processes in near future works."

The carbonyl index (CI) was measured with respect to the diverse conditions by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Then, a response surface model for the CI with respect to the temperature and UV irradiance was established. The glossiness, tensile properties, and Izod impact resistance were measured under various weathering conditions. The fracture properties were also tested using the essential work of fracture (EWF) method. The correlations between these properties and the CI were determined. The results show that the fracture toughness and crack growth resistance measured by the EWF tests were significantly reduced even at a low CI level, i.e., the early degradation stage, whereas the tensile properties and impact resistance did not noticeably change. Although the tensile properties and impact resistances maintained their initial properties until a certain CI value, the fracture characteristics degraded rapidly, even at the initial degradation level. The model was verified by comparison with samples weathered outdoors for four and six months in Seoul, Republic of Korea. It was confirmed that the model for the Izod impact strength (IZOD) with a CI function can predict the experimental IZOD data for the outdoor-weathered specimens using the predicted CI values, with an error of 5.6%."

Liverworts, which undergo a haplo-diplontic life cycle, spend most of their life as haploid gametophyte bodies, called thalli. In addition, the thalli can produce vegetative propagules, termed gemmae, conferring asexual reproduction in liverworts. Thus, to obtain sufficient isogenic tissues for genetic manipulation, the thallus is a suitable material. Here, we found that 23- to 25-d-old fully expanded thalli can be used for the genetic transformation with the pre-cultivation process, setting up the mature thalli pre-cultivation method. Next, we elucidated that 10- to 12-d-old young thalli can be used for the tissue-culture-based transformation in the absence of the pre-cultivation step, establishing the young thalli direct co-culture method without significant changes of transformation efficiency compared with the mature thalli pre-culture method. Overall, we set up the protocol using various stages of thalli of M. polymorpha with stable transformation efficiency. Mainly, we focused on reducing the hands-on labor time for performing the genetic transformation by widening the available stage of thalli for transformation or excluding the regenerating process of the thallus plantlets. In this report, we describe the detailed procedures employed under experimental conditions."
(AL)BERT Down the Garden Path: Psycholinguistic Experiments for Pre-trained Language Models,2022,"['targeted evaluation approach', 'transformers', 'garden-path structure', 'natural language processing', 'psycholinguistics']",,"This study compared the syntactic capabilities of several neural language models (LMs) including Transformers (BERT / ALBERT) and LSTM and investigated whether they exhibit human-like syntactic representations through a targeted evaluation approach, a method to evaluate the syntactic processing ability of LMs using sentences designed for psycholinguistic experiments. By employing garden-path structures with several linguistic manipulations, whether LMs detect temporary ungrammaticality and use a linguistic cue such as plausibility, transitivity, and morphology is assessed. The results showed that both Transformers and LSTM exploited several linguistic cues for incremental syntactic processing, comparable to human syntactic processing. They differed, however, in terms of whether and how they use each linguistic cue. Overall, Transformers had a more human-like syntactic representation than LSTM, given their higher sensitivity to plausibility and ability to retain information from previous words. Meanwhile, the number of parameters does not seem to undermine the performance of LMs, contrary to what was predicted in previous studies. Through these findings, this research sought to contribute to a greater understanding of the syntactic processing of neural language models as well as human language processing."

With the aid of in-Silico approach via homology modeling helps to build a 3D protein (target) model with the availability of GPBAR_HUMAN sequence data. The swiss-Model online workspace was used to model the GPBAR_HUMAN receptor using the Cryo-EM structure of the INT-777-bound GPBAR-Gs complex with PDB code (7CFN) as a potential template. The built receptor was evaluated, validated, and used as a target protein for molecular docking simulation of some potent nicotinamide and carboxamide series. The virtual screening studies via molecular docking revealed the binding pockets, binding modes and poses of the GPBAR_HUMAN receptor with some prominent anti-diabetic agents. Analysis of these interactions led to computational design via a structure-based approach of new potent anti-diabetic compounds with significant binding scores and better interactions with the GPBAR_HUMAN receptor. Validation of the designed compounds via Drug-likeness and ADME prediction confirmed that these compounds are orally bioavailable with a good lipophilicity index for lipid environments and show zero violation to the drug assessment rules in order to be considered as drug candidates. Therefore, in-vitro and an in-vivo test to transform these findings into potent therapeutics are strongly recommended."

The uniaxial tensile tests were performed on samples heat-treated through different procedures andstrain rates in the range of 0.005–5 s−1. It was observed that the strain rate slightly affects the formability of TRIP steel indifferent heat-treatment procedures. The obtained results showed that the H3 sample in which the samples austenitized at900 °C for 22 min then soaked at 400 °C for 1 h and finally quenched in oil at 50 °C and cooling at ambient temperature hadthe highest strain fracture. The nucleation and growth of voids, as well as the dynamic equilibrium between strain hardeningand recovery, were reasons for fracture strain increment from 0.005 to 0.1. However, fracture strain decreased at the strainrate of 0.1–5 s−1 due to the decrease of ductility. Also, TRIP steel characterizations were used for modeling the displacementand stress of the anti-roll bar by ANSYS 19.2 parametric language and Solid-Works. The displacement and stress results ofTRIP steel were compared to SAE Class 550 and Class 700 grades of steel."

Therefore, under the premise that the functional characteristics of the newly given free interior space will serve as distinction and value standards for the new segment, the present study examines spatial value in terms of the functional characteristics of changing interior spaces. To this end, based on a reinterpretation of space by applying the concepts of spatial variability, namely, movability, adaptation, transformation, and interaction, this study formed virtual models using mobility furniture units according to each of the concepts. This study then inferred their characteristics, functions, relationships, and user types and explored the possibility with regard to the thesis that these would change the standard for segment distinction. Study results identified changes in mobility values would vary in the autonomous driving era in terms of car segment standards, and individual user characteristics in mobility interior spaces would have a greater effect than bigness or smallness."

To estimate the modal parameters under turbulence excitation for flutter boundary prediction, a technique was developed and evaluated depending on the HilbertHuang transform in this paper. The results of simulated flutter cases show that the developed technique can identify modal frequencies more precisely than the modal damping ratio, while the estimation of the modal damping ratio is quite good. Finally, in a wind tunnel flutter test, good flutter boundaries were predicted in advance by using the modal parameters identified from the turbulence response at low airspeeds."

Americium is a major radionuclide responsible for the long-term radiotoxicity of SNF. In this study, the solubility of americium compounds was evaluated in synthetic groundwater (Syn- DB3), simulating groundwater from the DB3 site of the KAERI Underground Research Tunnel. Geochemical modeling was performed using the ThermoChimie_11a thermochemical database. Concentration of dissolved Am(III) in Syn-DB3 in the pH range of 6.4–10.5 was experimentally measured under over-saturation conditions by liquid scintillation counting over 70 d. The absorption spectra recorded for the same period suggest that Am(III) colloidal particles formed initially followed by rapid precipitation within 2 d. In the pH range of 7.5–10.5, the concentration of dissolved Am(III) converged to approximately 2×10−7 M over 70 d, which is comparable to that of the amorphous AmCO3OH(am) according to the modeling results. As the samples were aged for 70 d, a slow equilibrium process occurred between the solid and solution phases.There was no indication of transformation of the amorphous phase into the crystalline phase during the observation period."
Power Quality Improvement in Distribution System Based on Dynamic Voltage Restorer Using Rational Energy Transformative Optimization Algorithm,2022,"['Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR)', 'Distributed Energy Resources', 'Harmonic Compensation', 'Rational Energy Transformative Optimization (RETO) Algorithm']",,"In the power generation, transmission, and distribution system, power quality has always been essential to maintain stable power fl ow because of developing electronic loads applications. Various functionally operated electrical loads require an effi cient power quality to perform their operation. Power quality is aff ected by several aspects, namely voltage sags, swells, harmonics, etc. These issues cause signifi cant damage or produce failure in the load, which are the existing power quality challenges. The proposed work aims to reduce the previous eff ects and improve power quality along with Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR), which is implemented in this work to eliminate voltage sags, swells, and harmonics. A DVR is proposed based on inverter drop compensation to adjust the voltage to tolerance and is sensitive to meet the critical needs of power quality. In this system, the DVR-synchronized three-phase voltage in series is connected with the power supply step-up transformer with the appropriate amplitude and duration of discharge recovery power quality. To optimize the grid system, voltage amplitude and phase angle should be in an appropriate ratio. The DVR is a series controlled circuit, and the voltage is varied depending upon the load variation, which is analyzed by the proposed Rational Energy Transformative Optimization (RETO) Algorithm. This algorithm provides the suitable Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to the Voltage Source Inverter (VSI), which independently generates and absorbs reactive power or actual power. DVR loads are sensitive to separate injection voltage recovery line voltages. DVR is a highly tuned output voltage waveform with high power quality with less harmonic compensation and mitigates voltage transients in the distribution system. The Performance of DVR is simulated under dynamic conditions with various parameters like steady-state error, Effi ciency, Total Harmonics Distortion (THD) in the load. All the above-determined parameters are evaluated in MATLAB SIMULINK 2017b software. The prototype DVR module is also developed for the proposed model; in this system, the PIC16F877A microcontroller will be implemented to monitor and control the entire system."
Atorvastatin regulates the migration and invasion of prostate cancer through the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and matrix metalloproteinase pathways,2022,"['Atorvastatin', 'Epithelial mesenchymal transition', 'Matrix metalloproteinases', 'Prostate cancer']",,"Purpose: Our purpose was to verify the effects of atorvastatin (ATO) on prostate cancer (PCa) proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis and to further explore the drug’s mechanism of action.Materials and Methods: We used cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) and clone formation experiments to study the effect of ATO on the proliferation of PC3 cells. Flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining were used to detect cell apoptosis. Cell migration and invasion were detected through wound healing experiments and transwell experiments. Western blotting was applied to detect apoptosis-related proteins (BAX, Bcl-2, PARP, and Caspase-3), epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) proteins, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. A mouse xenograft tumor model was established, and tumor volume and weight were determined. The expression levels of the above-mentioned proteins were determined through western blot.Results: ATO inhibited PC-3 cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. ATO significantly up-regulated the expression of BAX, PARP, and Caspase-3 and inhibited the expression of Bcl-2. Wound healing and transwell experiments showed that ATO inhibited invasion and metastasis in PC-3 cells, possibly because ATO could inhibit the EMT and the expression of MMPs in PC-3 cells. Studies in nude mice showed that ATO significantly reduced tumor volume and weight; the expression levels of related proteins were consistent with the in vitro results.Conclusions: ATO inhibits the occurrence and development of PCa and regulates the migration and invasion of PCa cells by inhibiting the EMT and MMPs."

Hydroxymethylglutaryl- coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have been reported to have anti-fibrotic effects. Here, we investigated whether combined treatment with a statin and a COX-2 inhibitor has synergistic anti-fibrotic effects.Methods: The effects of treatment strategies incorporating both simvastatin and a COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, were investigated using an immortalized human hepatic stellate cell line (LX-2) and a hepatic fibrosis mouse model developed using thioacetamide (TAA) in drinking water. Cellular proliferation was investigated via 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine uptake. Pro- and anti-apoptotic factors were investigated through Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis.Results: The evaluation of the anti-proliferative effects on LX-2 cells showed that the observed effects were more pronounced with combination therapy than with single-drug therapy. Moreover, hepatic fibrosis and collagen deposition decreased significantly in TAA-treated mice in response to the combined treatment strategy. The mechanisms underlying the anti-fibrotic effects of the combination therapy were investigated. The effects of the combination therapy were correlated with increased expression levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling molecules, upregulation of the Bax/Bcl- 2 signaling pathway, inhibition of the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway, and inhibition of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 2.Conclusions: The combination of simvastatin and NS-398 resulted in a synergistic anti-fibrotic effect through multiple pathways. These findings offer a theoretical insight into the possible clinical application of this strategy for the treatment of advanced liver diseases with hepatic fibrosis."

A math wordproblem written in human language which describes everyday situations in a mathematical form. Math word problem solving requiresan artificial intelligence model to understand the implied logic within the problem. Therefore, it is being studied variously across theworld to improve the language understanding ability of artificial intelligence. In the case of the Korean language, studies so far havemainly attempted to solve problems by classifying them into templates, but there is a limitation in that these techniques are difficultto apply to datasets with high classification difficulty. To solve this problem, this paper used the KoEPT model which uses ‘expression’tokens and pointer networks. To measure the performance of this model, the classification difficulty scores of IL, CC, and ALG514, whichare existing Korean mathematical sentence problem datasets, were measured, and then the performance of KoEPT was evaluated using5-fold cross-validation. For the Korean datasets used for evaluation, KoEPT obtained the state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance with 99.1%in CC, which is comparable to the existing SOTA performance, and 89.3% and 80.5% in IL and ALG514, respectively. In addition, asa result of evaluation, KoEPT showed a relatively improved performance for datasets with high classification difficulty. Through an ablationstudy, we uncovered that the use of the ‘expression’ tokens and pointer networks contributed to KoEPT’s state of being less affectedby classification difficulty while obtaining good performance."

Since the analog environment as a physical reality and the digital environment as an electronic representation have fundamentally different properties, the transforming an inseparable object of reality into a segmented one in the digital environment is not simple. When these concerns are combined with the humanistic awareness, the process of 'conceptual data modeling' as a method of conceptualizing objects inevitably entails complicated reasoning. On the other hand, the data modeling process based on micro reading and interpretation of humanities texts and clear humanistic awareness is the basis for creating sophisticated humanities data and the basic clue for enabling varied digital humanities study from it.As part of a model for organizing and portraying the world of 'Yeohang Culture', in which a large amount lot of information is in a complicated relationship through a variety of records, as three-dimensional data in a digital environment, The Class designed through this research includes ‘Person’, ‘Community’, ‘Group’, ‘Writing’, ‘Object’, ‘Book’, ‘Place’, ‘Site’, ‘Event’, ‘Clan’ and ‘Office’. The representative Relationship defined as semantic links between entities belonging to individual classes includes ‘A author B’, ‘A writer B’, ‘A calligrapher B’, ‘A painter B’, ‘A mentions B’, ‘A contains B’ and ‘A member B’. As a medium that comprehensively connects knowledge related to ‘Yeohang culture’, The Class and Relationship can be an effective channel that bridges the barriers between majors such as Sino-Korean Literature, Social History, Art History and Cultural History.In the future, a comprehensive discussion-research that crosses the fields of Literature-History-Art should be conducted in order to compile a 'Yeohang Culture' database that can extensively look into the status consciousness and artistic activities of the commoners in the late Joseon period through the literature directly or indirectly related to them. it is hoped that the contents summarized in this study might be meaningfully used as a basic clue for such a move."
문제중심학습을 적용한 중국고전시가 수업모형 개발,2022,"['problem-based learning(PBL)', 'Chinese classical poetry', 'presentation', 'book report', 'group discussion', 'group performance', 'questionnaire']",,"In this study, the problem-based learning(PBL) instructional model of Chinese classical poetry was reviewed. PBL is a teaching and learning method designed so that students no longer focus on finding answers. Therefore, it emphasizes the process of solving unstructured problems that reflect the realistic context. The ""ubiquity of knowledge"" is the most changed educational environment in the era of digital transformation. The transfer of fixed knowledge can no longer be seen as a mastery of university education. Along with the change in the educational paradigm, the instructor's mission is now moving toward cultivating the ability of learners to construct knowledge on their own.However, as with all methodologies, theory alone does not solve all practical problems. It is necessary to improve the practical educational effect by examining all three elements of the class: instructor, learner, and educational content. The educational goal of ""Chinese Classical Poetry 1"" was placed on the general point of view of literary education such as cultivation of creativity, imagination, and expression. In order to find out which class model would be good when applying PBL, I meta-analyzed my own class site over three semesters. Four types of unstructured 'problems' to be presented to learners were selected: presentation of appreciation of the work, writing a book report, group discussion, and group performance. And we looked at the learner's results for this type. Overall, it is evaluated that the PBL instructional model has led to significant development in terms of motivation and achievement improvement in learning ""Chinese Classical Poetry 1"".The instructor's subjective impression of the effect of the instructional model is not enough. Therefore, a questionnaire consisting of 18 questions was distributed to 99 students and the results were analyzed. The learner's satisfaction with the PBL questionnaire model was generally excellent, so the possibility of this model could be highly evaluated. The ""professionality,"" ""difficulty level,"" and ""group composition,"" which had somewhat low scores, were reviewed how to supplement the problems. Through the analysis of the results of the 4 multiple choice, it was possible to confirm the preference for group performance and group discussion. However, I still think the importance of personal learning should not be overlooked. In the analysis of the results of the descriptive question, the factors that students had difficulty or needed more support in the PBL class model were identified. Students asked for more attention to ""time arrangement,"" ""difficulty adjustment,"" and ""providing examples and feedback."" In addition, it was found that 'preparing objective evaluation standards' is also important. Referring to the analysis results as described above, it is expected that a better PBL class model can be designed.In short, I think PBL can be an attempt to establish the status of literary education more actively. What abilities should the 'human resources with humanities' that our era needs along with the right personality? Through the development of a teaching model using PBL, I hope that the class of Chinese classical poetry will be an example of how education performs such humanities' responsibilities."
정압설비의 효율적 관리를 위한 예측모형 활용방안 연구,2022,"['Static pressure facility', 'time series', 'machine learning', 'prediction', 'safety management']",,"The demand for urban gas continues to increase and is widely used in homes and industries. However, if the demand for urban gas is not properly predicted, the management costs of inventory increase, and supply and demand management is inefficient. For a stable supply of city gas, it is necessary to predict the pressure of the city gas static pressure device which maintains the gas pressure suitable for the gas user device at a constant level. This paper aims to increase the pressure management efficiency of the static pressure system by using pressure prediction model based on the time series model and the machine learning model. The data for analysis is pressure data collected based on the SCADA system. We added temperature variables, which affect the pressure, for analysis. Temperature variables are collected at the same time when the pressure of the stator is collected. After data preprocessing, training data and validation data for prediction are generated. The prediction model is implemented using SARIMA model, SARIMAX model, LSTM model, and Transformer model. As a result of the prediction, it was confirmed that the RMSE of the SARIMAX model was the lowest at 0.0248."

In this regard, the purpose of this paper is to implement an explanatory model between the lightning strikes and the lightning failures of distribution transformers. Since spatial distributions are hard to be analyzed by the ordinary least square (OLS) method, geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis was applied to find the explanatory properties between the spatial lightning strikes and the spatial lightning failure transformers. As a result of the regression analysis, GWR analysis shows improved explanatory power compared to the OLS method and enables additional analysis to be performed by specifying points showing high explanatory power and regression coefficients in the visual analysis."

Wear-out failure, in particular, can be minimized using lifetime analysis. This study focuses on the lifetime estimation of transformers and considers multiple failure-modes. In this way, the reliability of aging equipment can be analyzed individually.Methods: We propose a change-point model for the Weibull distribution for multiple failure-modes. By defining the function for a generalized likelihood ratio, the change-point for wear-out failure as well as the parameters for multiple lifetime-distributions can be estimated.Results: The proposed approach is applied to real-life data of electric transformers. As a result of the lifetime analysis, the lifetime distribution, including multiple failure-modes and their cutoff points (in time) can be determined.Conclusion: Using the investigated change-point analysis, both the lifetime and maintenance schedule of transformers with respect to multiple failure-modes can be estimated, and the chance for expensive equipment failure is reduced significantly."

Since the implementation method varies depending on ratio differential relay manufacturer, there exist some differences in the operation results of the protective relay and eventually the facility operator may have difficulties in analyzing the cause of the fault. In this paper, various electrical faults are simulated by modeling a wye-delta transformer, and the operation results of the protective relays are categorized patterned. Based on these results, a logic circuit is proposed to identify a failure in transformer fault. The fault type identification function and the operation stability of transformer is improved."

In relation to drama therapy, the characteristics of Grotowski's theatrical theory are the aesthetics of revelation, encounter, and therapy. In that revelation is also a channel for treatment in psychological therapy, Grotowski's revelation through theatrical methods is directly related to drama therapy. If obstacles are removed and one reveals oneself, a real meeting will be possible. The encounter following the revelation is communication and sharing between the actor and the audience, and it becomes a free and pure state of soul that is free from the bondage of convention. Those who are reborn will, in other words, be the one who was healed. As such, the essence of the theater Grotowski wanted to find is to participate in the drama with the intention of treatment and promote change through the drama process, expressing and solving the problems experienced by the participants or maintaining the well-being and health of the participants. This is exactly in line with Johnson's developmental transformations model, which suggests that participants can escape solitude and discover themselves in meetings with therapists. Johnson recognizes the nature of the treatment of Grotowski's theater and calls the developmental transformations model, a poor drama therapy. Therefore, this study attempts to answer the following questions. First, in what way does Grotowski's play have the character of drama therapy? Second, in what way can DvT be said to be poor theater therapy?"

In addition, the study presented a case of a middle school in Seoul, which actually applied this curriculum and published a collection of students’ works from 2020 to 2021. By doing so, the study showed the applicability of the model in the education field.By engaging in activities related to writing novels using their imagination, students get to produce creative works and can cultivate both a sense of ecological transformation and practical capacity that will enable them to actively respond to climate disasters in the future at both individual and collective levels. Furthermore, the convergence curriculum design model presented in this paper suggests that there is a possibility that teachers can be used as a method to support various educational activities as well as ecological conversion education as they transform the components of 'content base' and 'performance base' in different ways."

Circulating current may occur under unbalanced conditions when using the existing non-standard interconnected transformer for the distributed generation, and this circulating current problem must be solved from the perspective of a distributed power provider in order to accommodate the needs of the power utility. In addition, as the load connected to the power system through the rectifier increases, the harmonic current caused in the neutral wire is also increasing, and there is a need to solve various relevant problems. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an auxiliary transformer (grounding transformer), which has multiple auxiliary roles (reduction of excessive circulating current, protection of non-grounding systems by providing effective grounding).The developed zigzag transformer has been verified its performance through a characteristic test and an accredited agency certification test after manufacture. In this paper, the design of the zigzag transformer and the modeling of it by using Power System Computer Aided Design (PSCAD) are described.

The skull of a secular saint was reproduced in plaster as part of the long tradition of worshiping relics and casting death masks, contributing to the memorial culture. The imprinted and cast skull model was regarded as a true image made without hands and it became a popular collection item in phrenological and anatomical laboratories. Thanks to its realistic representation, the skull cast became the subject of scientific research in which objectivity is emphasized. However, in the blind belief of researchers that the skull bears the marks of artistic genius, the plaster model remained an object of unconditional admiration and mixed the ideology of objectivity with the culture of the artist cult. The skull model followed the tradition of the artist cult in the Goethe era and provided material for modern or premodern hagiography. The skull model transformed the artist's bone, which was nothing, into an organ of difference. It played the role of an active agent in the culture that worshipped artists in the Goethe era."

In the healthcare industry as well, calls for advancing the healthcare information system (HIS) through cloud-based digital transformation are gaining momentum so that healthcare services can be received ‘anytime and anywhere’ from a patient perspective, not from a hospital one. Most of the previous studies on cloud computing in the field of HIS have been conducted from the perspective of hospitals that establish and operate HIS; there is a clear limitation that it has not been conducted from the perspective of patients who need healthcare services. Therefore, based on the value-based adoption model (VAM), this study derives perceived risk (i.e., privacy risk, performance risk, institutional risk) and perceived benefit (i.e., usefulness, shared benefit, economic benefit) factors, and investigates their impact on perceived value and acceptance resistance in the context of cloud-based HIS. A structural equation model analysis was conducted using 118 samples obtained through an online survey targeting potential HIS users at general hospitals in Korea. As a result of hypotheses testing, it was found that privacy risk, shared benefit, and economic benefit significantly impact perceived value, which in turn negatively influences acceptance resistance. This study is the first to apply the VAM to the context of cloud-based HIS. Research findings would help managers considering the introduction of cloud-based HIS in the future prepare practical guidelines to reduce user acceptance resistance effectively."

Mostautonomous valet parking systems calculate trajectories by first finding the location of a parking space and then tracking the pathbetween the current position and the space while driving or parking. However, these systems do not have a process of modifyingparking trajectories in the middle of the action. This increases the risk of collisions due to a system failure to properly detect newobstacles or incorrectly generated parking trajectories arising from hardware errors. To address these problems, it is necessary toconduct research on how to modify parking trajectories while driving. The methods outlined in this paper utilize visual simultaneouslocalization and mapping (Visual SLAM), ultrasonic sensors, and models with Ackerman geometry to adjust parking trajectories. VisualSLAM determines the location of the model vehicle and the chosen parking space. Once these locations are established, ultrasonicsensors determine whether the situation requires trajectory modification. From this information, the transformed Ackerman geometricmodel is applied to compute any required trajectory changes. This new method is applied to experimental parking scenarios todetermine whether the proposed trajectory modification method was viable. The experimental results of this study indicated thatautonomous parking was successfully carried out in 81.66% and 78.33% of autonomous parking events where the parking space waslocated on the left and right sides of the model vehicle, respectively. These results suggest that applying this model to autonomousparking and driving scenarios makes trajectory generation a viable solution for collision avoidance."

Nevertheless, there exists strong skepticism towards the net benefit of green management regarding the excessive financial burden firms should bear. To make green management sustainable, firms should achieve green innovation that helps them balance their gaining economic value and society's environmental value.Existing literature suggests that customer and/or supplier involvement is an important facilitator of firms' innovation performance. However, research on the mechanism through which customer/supplier involvement transforms ideas and knowledge into green innovation is limited. Furthermore, empirical findings about the potential effect of customer/supplier involvements on innovation outcomes are in disagreement.To fill the research gaps, this study adapts the strategy-structure-performance framework (SSP framework) and argues: (1) the intention of firms to become jointly involved in green management with supply chain partner(s) is their unique business strategy; (2) boundary-spanning routines between partners, which consist of knowledge and relationship routines, function as a supply-chain-unique organizational structure; and (3) boundary-spanning routines act as a mechanism that actualizes supply chain partner involvement strategy to achieve green innovation.Using survey data from 101 Korean manufacturing firms, this study reports that: (1) customer and supplier involvement positively influence green innovation performance, (2) supplier and customer involvement lead to the development of relationship boundary spanning routines, (3) knowledge boundary spanning routines mediate relationships between customer involvement and green innovation, and (4) relationship boundary spanning routines mediate the relationships between customer/supplier involvements and green innovation.This study will contribute to the body of knowledge by reaffirming the customer/supplier involvement-innovation performance link but with the mediating effect of boundary-spanning routines.

Further, with a discussion of socio-ecological market economy, this article will also try to figure out whether the German model can still be a successful model for European integration. To this end, Chapter II attempts a theoretical discussion on the concept and practice of German social market economy based on ordoliberalism. In addition, Chapter III briefly discusses the development and implementation of the social market economy and analyzes the characteristics and success factors of the social market economy through the reorganization and transformation of the German model. While having a correlation with European integration, this article explores the fact that they are the economic and social results of reorganization by mutually influencing each other in the process of formation and expansion of Eurocapitalism at the transnational level. Finally, Chapter V seeks to find an answer to the question of whether the German model or the German social market economy can still be a success model for the European Union through a new experiment called a social-ecological market economy."

Due to the biological mechanism of neurons, it consumes less power for training and reasoning than conventional neural networks. Recently, as deep learning models become huge and operating costs increase exponentially, the spiking neural network is attracting attention as a third-generation neural network that connects convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks, and related research is being actively conducted. However, in order to apply the spiking neural network model to the industry, a lot of research still needs to be done, and the problem of model retraining to apply a new model must also be solved. In this paper, we propose a method to minimize the cost of model retraining by extracting the weights of the existing trained deep learning model and converting them into the weights of the spiking neural network model. In addition, it was found that weight conversion worked correctly by comparing the results of inference using the converted weights with the results of the existing model."

A recent research trend is to apply transfer learning to a pre-training model based on Transformer encoder with a parallel corpus in QE. In this paper, we proposed a dual-encoder architecture that learns a monolingual representation of each respective language in encoders. Thereafter, it learns a cross-lingual representation of each language in cross-attention networks. Thus, it overcomes the limitations of a single-encoder architecture in cross-lingual tasks, such as QE. We proved that the dual-encoder architecture is structurally more advantageous over the single-encoder architecture and furthermore, improved the performance and stability of the dual-encoder model in QE by applying the pre-trained language model to the dual-encoder model. Experiments were conducted on WMT20 QE data for En-De pair.

To inject the real-world knowledge bases to a pretrained language model, many studies towards “knowledge enhanced” pretrained language models have been conducted. Among them, LUKE attaches a sequence of entities to a sequence of original input tokens and performs entity-aware self-attention using entity embeddings, leading to noticeable improved results on entity-related tasks and the state-of-the-art performance in SQuAD dataset. In this paper, we present a Korean version of LUKE pretrained from a large amount of Korean Wikipedia corpus and show its application results on entity-related tasks of Korean.

Comparative study of text representation and learning for Persian named entity recognition,2022,"['contextualized representation', 'NER', 'Persian language processing']",,"Transformer models have had a great impact on natural language processing (NLP) in recent years by realizing outstanding and efficient contextualized language models. Recent studies have used transformer-based language models for various NLP tasks, including Persian named entity recognition (NER). However, in complex tasks, for example, NER, it is difficult to determine which contextualized embedding will produce the best representation for the tasks. Considering the lack of comparative studies to investigate the use of different contextualized pretrained models with sequence modeling classifiers, we conducted a comparative study about using different classifiers and embedding models. In this paper, we use different transformer-based language models tuned with different classifiers, and we evaluate these models on the Persian NER task. We perform a comparative analysis to assess the impact of text representation and text classification methods on Persian NER performance. We train and evaluate the models on three different Persian NER datasets, that is, MoNa, Peyma, and Arman. Experimental results demonstrate that XLM-R with a linear layer and conditional random field (CRF) layer exhibited the best performance. This model achieved phrase-based F-measures of 70.04, 86.37, and 79.25 and word-based F scores of 78, 84.02, and 89.73 on the MoNa, Peyma, and Arman datasets, respectively.

企业财务数字化转型研究: 基于中国多案例质性分析,2022,"['Digital transformation', 'Enterprise finance', 'Financial sharing', 'Financial intelligence', 'Digital neural networking']",,"In recent years, digital technologies and their embeddedness have attracted academic attention beyond information systems. There has been significant and steady growth in the number of publications on the different technical and organizational aspects of digital transformation. Digital transformation and the resulting business model innovations fundamentally change consumer expectations and behavior and disrupt the traditional market, putting tremendous pressure on businesses. Thus, organizations of all types and sizes emphasize digital transformation, which is becoming increasingly prevalent and necessary across all business functions. This form of organizational transformation often maximizes firm outcomes and profits, thereby responding to market demands and achieving a sustainable competitive advantage.Finance departments are at the core of any enterprise. How should they build their frameworks and paths for digital transformation? Few studies have addressed this question. To fill the gap and enrich the theoretical connotations and practical guidance for the digital transformation of enterprise finance, we selected three representative Chinese companies, ZTE, Sany Group, and FAW-Volkswagen Automobile Co., as case studies to examine their successful path for the digital transformation of enterprise finance using qualitative analysis. We first propose a three-tier progressive theoretical framework for the digital transformation of enterprise finance: Financial sharing at the bottom level, financial automation and intelligence at the middle level, and financial digitalization at the top level. Then, a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the evolutionary path and the critical issues in the implementation process of their digital transformation of finance is provided from this framework.Our results show that the successful digital transformation of enterprise finance is not a simple linear development process but a cascading process of iterative renewal. More detailed conclusions can be summarized as follows: 1) Enterprises implement bottom-level financial sharing under operational pressure; 2) Enterprises have gradually evolved into middle-level financial automation and intelligence; 3) Enterprises practice top-level financial digitization using cloud computing, big data, and other tools. Our results offer a theoretical lens for scholars studying digital transformation in enterprise finance. Moreover, we provide practical insights for a better digital transformation of enterprise finance."

The proposed IM improves instance segmentation performance by 2.5 AP higher than Mask-RCNN in the COCO dataset, and in the periment for optimizing the IM location, the best performance was shown when it was located in the ‘Top’ before FPN and backbone were combined. Therefore, the proposed method can improve the performance of models using Mask-RCNN as a base model."

In addition, successful digital transformation will be essential in securing competitive priorities in the fourth industrial revolution era. By applying the cumulative theory, this study investigates the relationship among competitive priorities (quality, dependability, flexibility and cost), including digital transformation. The analysis was conducted on 153 manufacturing companies using SEM(structural equation modeling). The result shows a statistically significant causal relationship in the order of quality - dependability - flexibility - digital transformation - cost. Alternative models were established to validate the order of competitive priorities in digital transformation and compare with the research model in this study. Consequently the sequence established in this study was the most appropriate one. This study has major implications as it is a preemptive empirical study on digital transformation, and quantitatively and qualitatively expanded on the well-studied Cumulative theory."

This paper attempts to utilize cross-sectional data from 333 ICT manufacturing firms and to build two different types of innovation ecosystem models and the innovation performance model. First, the findings show that in the knowledge spillover channel model, ICT manufacturing firms tend to use IPRs and collaboration channels rather than the public domain channel. Second, in the innovation partnership model, ICT manufacturing firms prefer partnerships with private companies that are their buyers within the supply chain of the high-tech industry rather than utilizing their internal innovation resources and even local universities nearby. Third, the findings also show that in the innovation performance model, the product innovation performance of ICT manufacturing firms is highly associated with patents and R&D spending. Moreover, the product innovation performance of ICT manufacturing firms has a positive relationship with non-financial support of the government such as HR, technique, certifications, etc., but it has a negative relationship with the direct financial support of the government because it is more likely to consider about a moral hazard problem."

As a result, not only the structures that support society but also our way of thinking are changing. This poses a major challenge to the legal systems. This is because norms including laws govern human actions and communications. Human actions and communications presuppose a specific social space and social structures. Depending on how social structures are formed, human actions or communication methods change, which in turn changes the form of social deviant behavior such as crime. The legal norms we have today are mainly formed in ‘the modern society.’ Therefore, our legal norms presuppose the social structures, space and human image that the modern society has oriented. However, with the rapid development of science and technology and the outbreak of the corona virus, the society we live in is undergoing rapid changes. As a result, the social structures, thinking models and human image presupposed by the legal norm also must face revolutionary changes and challenges. The examples are include post-anthropocentric thinking, the emergence and settlement of new social spaces such as metaverses, a change in interaction methods from actions to communications, and deepfake situations in which the boundary between the real and the fake is blurring. Accordingly, this article deals with how legal norms should respond to such a change process. It examines how legal thinking is changing in terms of subject, object, action and world, and how legal norms should respond to it. At this time, we focus on the new thinking model of legal norms, the life domain, the mental domain and the state model."

Wushu movement The Wushu movement recognition model is built based on the hidden Markovmodel (HMM). The HMM model is trained and taught with the help of the Baum-Welch algorithm, which isthen enhanced using the frequency weighted training approach and the mean training method. To identify thedynamic Wushu movement, the Viterbi algorithm is used to determine the probability of the optimal statesequence for each Wushu movement model. In light of the foregoing, an HMM-based martial arts movementsrecognition model is developed. The recognition accuracy of the HMM model increases to 99.60% when thenumber of samples is 4,000, which is greater than the accuracy of the SVM (by 0.94%), the CNN (by 1.12%),and the BP (by 1.14%). From what has been discussed, it appears that the suggested system for detecting martialarts acts is trustworthy and effective, and that it may contribute to the growth of martial arts."

This study aims to enquire into the effect of the digital transformational paradigm shift on hybrid festivals using an integrative approach. Focused on the 10th Gangnam festival in 2021, three methods were performed. First, a survey was conducted for 10 days during the festival and a total of 880 people were finally analyzed; 304 on-site visitors and 576 online visitors. Second, big data using social media, news, and blogs were crawled for about 10 months, and topic modeling and sentiment analysis were conducted. Finally, festival-related experts’ opinions were collected. The result indicated that most of the hybrid programs showed higher satisfaction with on-site visitors; however, interestingly, some were derived in the opposite way. In addition, positive emotional words were derived overwhelmingly, proving the effect of the hybrid festival. This study contributed to broadening festival theory academically in the forthcoming post-COVID-19 era. It is expected to provide practical guidelines for planning and operating to accelerate the paradigm shift to hybrid festivals through digital transformation to festival practitioners."

Second, a consistency loss between global and local features of a body part is proposed for improving the discrimination to recognize the identical person.We compare the mAP and Rank-1 performances of our approach and various existing methods on the Occluded-Duke dataset.Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the competitive methods."

The analysis found that charisma, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration all had a significantly positive (+) effect on organizational performance. Collective and rational cultures strengthened the influence of charisma on organizational performance, and development cultures strengthened the influence of intellectual stimulation on organizational performance. The results suggest that the components of transformational leadership should be used differently depending on the culture of the public organization to improve public organization performance."

In this paper, we propose a method for detecting multiple sclerosis lesions based on the UNETR deep learning model that replaces a transformer with encoders. In particular, since the number of image data is small due to the characteristics of the medical field, a data augmentation technique is applied to prevent sufficient training and overfitting of the model.

카메라 시점 변환을 이용한 전이 기반 적대적 공격 기법,2022,"['Adversarial attack', 'Transferability', 'Transfer-based adversarial attack', 'Adversarial example', 'Camera viewpoint transformation']",,"An adversarial attack is a technique to mislead convolutional neural networks into wrong predictions by adding human-imperceptible noises to clean images. When access to a target model is prohibited, the attacker should rely on the transferability of adversarial examples. Transferability refers to the fundamental characteristic of neural networks that an adversarial example crafted from one network is likely to fool other structurally different networks as well. In this setting, the adversary generates adversarial examples using a local source model and expects these images to remain adversarial for an unknown target model. This paper proposes a Camera Viewpoint Transformation to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. This is based on the assumption that adversarial examples should remain adversarial from any point of view. The Camera Viewpoint Transformation in the attack prevent the generated images from overfitting to the source model and hence create stronger adversarial images. Consequently, the Camera Viewpoint Transformation method showed 5.4p% superior attack performance compared to the similar existing methods. Finally, we analyze in detail the reasons for this performance improvement in terms of the number of image transformations and their randomness."

Traffic accident rates were divided by the length of the section in terms of accident frequency, fatalities, and injured respectively. Traffic congestion index was set to daily V/C. The relationship between the congestion level and traffic accident rate seems to be positive linear pattern increasing traffic accident rate while congestion level is more higher. This result comes from scatter plots and box plots as well. It was motivated to adopt linear regression modeling. In simple regression model with V/C as a independent variable, modeling without intercept is the best in terms of R². But both models for fatalities and injured were the best when the intercept was set to 0 and accident rates was transformed by logarithm. A Model for accident is satisfied having 0.75 of R² but each model for injured and fatalities has 0.58, 0.51 of R² which is relatively low but acceptable value. The study has value confirming that there is a virtuous cycle effect that increasing highway capacity through highway project is affected to decrease traffic accident as well as reduce congestion level. The future study will focus on benefit estimation technique from reducing traffic accident using the developed models aiming to improving the guideline for preliminary feasibility study."
Trajectory analyses of uncontrolled circular parachutes in random spatial wind fields,2022,"['Circular parachutes', 'Impact dispersion', 'Drop trajectory', 'Spatial wind fields']",,"The present paper explores the trajectories of two uncontrolled circular parachute models which differ in size and mass in random spatial wind fields. The wind velocity components were generated through three-dimensional inverse fast Fourier transforms; and the correlations of the simulation data compared with the theoretical functions to confirm the accuracy of the wind model. The parachute systems are modelled as six-degrees-of-freedom rigid bodies, on which the aerodynamic forces and moments are applied. The dynamics model was validated before being used to study the drop trajectories of the parachute systems in spatial wind fields. Analyzing the drop trajectories and the impact point dispersion characteristics of the two parachute systems, the paper shows that the smaller one oscillates at a higher frequency and is affected more strongly by the wind. While descending at low altitude, there could be resonance between the dynamics of the larger parachute model and the wind turbulence.Moreover, it is found that the use of simplified vertical wind profiles, which include only the variation of the wind velocity against the altitude, may cause significant error in the simulation results."

The results of the empirical analysis found that the characteristics of the policy networks making policy were different in the two policy cases. A modified policy community appeared in the case of Shin-Gori No. 5&6, while a modified issue network appeared in the case of JeJu International Green Hospital. In the former case, a number of actors officially proposed consensus policy recommendations based on a wide range of interests through frequent and high-level interactions. On the other hand, in the latter case, a number of actors had conflicting policy recommendations based on narrow interests through formal but intermittent and low-level interactions. Therefore, it can be said that the difference in the type of policy network occurring in the two policy cases was caused by the difference in network structure-actors, integration, power, and so forth.The implications derived from the results of this study are that public debate decisions were analyzed by applying a policy network model for the first time. The results of this study theoretically prove Rhodes & Marsh's policy network model, but there is a policy-making phenomenon transformed from the basic form. Real policy decisions are not strictly divided into policy communities or issue networks, but are made in a modified policy network in which the two types are mixed. The meaning of this modified type of policy decision implies the need for multi-layered network policy decisions in the era of the governance paradigm in Korea unlike government-led policy decisions in the era of the government paradigm. However, it can be seen that policy decisions are influenced by the environmental context and the characteristics of the political system in each country, as well as the influence and activities of interest groups and civic groups acting in society."
Unsupervised Transfer Learning for Plant Anomaly Recognition,2022,"['Plant Disease Recognition', 'Unsupervised Transfer Learning', 'Plant Village Dataset', 'Vision Transformer']",,"Disease threatens plant growth and recognizing the type of disease is essential to making a remedy. In recent years, deep learning has witnessed a significant improvement for this task, however, a large volume of labeled images is one of the requirements to get decent performance. But annotated images are difficult and expensive to obtain in the agricultural field. Therefore, designing an efficient and effective strategy is one of the challenges in this area with few labeled data. Transfer learning, assuming taking knowledge from a source domain to a target domain, is borrowed to address this issue and observed comparable results. However, current transfer learning strategies can be regarded as a supervised method as it hypothesizes that there are many labeled images in a source domain. In contrast, unsupervised transfer learning, using only images in a source domain, gives more convenience as collecting images is much easier than annotating. In this paper, we leverage unsupervised transfer learning to perform plant disease recognition, by which we achieve a better performance than supervised transfer learning in many cases. Besides, a vision transformer with a bigger model capacity than convolution is utilized to have a better-pretrained feature space. With the vision transformer-based unsupervised transfer learning, we achieve better results than current works in two datasets. Especially, we obtain 97.3% accuracy with only 30 training images for each class in the Plant Village dataset. We hope that our work can encourage the community to pay attention to vision transformer-based unsupervised transfer learning in the agricultural field when with few labeled images."

The acoustic emission source localization network AESLNet proposed in this study was constructed using convolutional layers in parallel because of the anisotropy of the composited materials. A regression model was used to detect the coordinates of the acoustic emission source location. The hyper-parameter of the network was optimized by Bayesian optimization.

Diff erent from the model established in static reference frame, the SRF control model can refl ect the coupling characteristic of the active and reactive current.

A novel complex PI controller design method is proposed based on the SRF control model and the coeffi cients are calculated. And its implementation in the control loop is given. Compared with existing PI controllers with real or complex coeffi cients, the proposed complex PI controller can realize completely the decoupling of the active and reactive current in three-phase system. Besides, the control scheme can make current loop fulfi ll the expected symmetrical bandwidth, so as to realize a higher eff ective set-off frequency. As a result, the inverter can achieve well dynamic performance. Finally, the simulation and experimental results are given to verify the theoretical analysis."

This study focuses on the case of Ecuador in Latin America, which has been actively pursuing these discussions before our country. Since the 1990s, the Buen Vivir discourse has been formed by indigenous movement as a transition discourse, distancing from the mainstream development model based on extractivism. It has since evolved into an umbrella term in Latin America that encompasses various alternatives to the mainstream model of development. Meanwhile, in Ecuador, the regime of Rafael Correa, which came to power in 2007, drafted a new constitution based on the concept of Buen Vivir and implemented various alternative policies. This study analyses the Buen Vivir discourse and its practice in Ecuador, focusing on the case of the northern Ecuadorian Amazon. While civil society proposed Post-oil development as a radical practice of the Buen Vivir discourse, the Correa regime faced the dilemma between Post-oil development and extractivism in a phased process of action that took into account the various interests of realpolitik. By analysing the dilemmas in Ecuador’s transition discourse and practice, this study draws implications for transition in the era of climate crisis."

In general, the CCTVs in the tunnel are installed at a low height as well as near by the moving vehicles due to the spatial limitation of tunnel structure, so a severe perspective effect takes place in the distance of installed CCTV and moving vehicles. Because of this effect, conventional CCTV-based accident detection systemsin tunnel are known in general to be very hard to achieve the performance in detection of unexpected accidents such as stop or reversely moving vehicles, person on the road and fires, especially far from 100 m. Therefore, in this study, the region of interest is setup and a new concept of inverse perspective transformation technique is introduced. Since moving vehicles in the transformed image is enlarged proportionally to the distance from CCTV, it is possible to achieve consistency in object detection andidentification of actual speed of moving vehicles in distance. To show this aspect, two datasets in the same conditions are composed with the original and the transformed images of CCTV in tunnel, respectively. A comparison of variation of appearance speed and size of moving vehicles in distance are made. Then, the performances of the object detection in distance are compared with respect to the both trained deep-learning models. As a result, the model case with the transformed images are able to achieve consistent performance in object and accident detections in distance even by 200 m."

The growth of online shopping malls made it more challenging for customers to find products that matched their preferences, and they experienced significant tiredness when making their selections. To address this inconvenience, this paper proposes a method to display products that meet the preference by score when a user enters his or her preferences for three criteria: delivery, size, and quality. The BERT-based preference analysis AI model is used to analyze the review texts of each product in the user-desired category among the stored items, and the results are conveyed by scoring in accordance with the user's own preferences. Users can assist in making purchases by using their scored preferences."

This paper proposes a methodology that can effectively detect fraud transactions in electronic prepayment by machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines, decision trees, and artificial neural networks. Actual transaction data of electronic prepayment services were collected and preprocessed to extract the most relevant variables from raw data. Two different approaches were explored in the paper. One is a transaction-based approach, and the other is a user ID-based approach. For the transaction-based approach, the first model is primarily based on raw data features, while the second model uses extra features in addition to the first model. The user ID-based approach also used feature engineering to extract and transform the most relevant features. Overall, the user ID-based approach showed a better performance than the transaction-based approach, where the artificial neural networks showed the best performance. The proposed method could be used to reduce the damage caused by financial accidents by detecting and blocking fraud attempts."

This is made possible by a model that integrates a steady-state equation using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model and an unsteady-state estimation using the large-eddy simulation (LES) model and the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings aerodynamic noise model, and by numerical solution to the model.Our computational model is validated on the sound pressure level with the help of the measurements on a physical system. The validation suggests that the proposed bionic volute significantly increases the aerodynamic performance particularly in terms of transformation between the pressure and flow rate under the rated power. The noise associated to the bionic volute is found to be predominantly tonal noise, and this is the primary source of the noise of the fan.Another finding is that the large expansion profile of the proposed volute contributes to the attenuation of the tonal noise associated to the periodic jet impingement at the impeller outlet."

The difference between this discussion and the existing discussion is that it referred to Berry’s cultural transformation model, viewed Koreans in Japan as subjects of speech, not as objects of reproduction, and finally looked at Son Chang-seop’s inner landscape through the focus speaker “I.” Japan, which was an unequal multi-ethnic country, excluded other peoples who were the same people in the past based on its new identity as a single nation state when it created a new country after the defeat. As a result, Koreans in Japan were forced to exist as invisible minorities for a long time in Japanese society. Senior citizens Choi Won-bok and Koichi Takamura (Ko Kwang-il), who are the first generation of Koreans in Japan, show separation and assimilation in the cultural transformation model. The contrast between Choi Won-bok and Koichi Takamura (Ko Kwang-il) is realistically revealed through food. In light of the fact that the original taste for food not only reflects identity but also constitutes cultural identity, the difference between Choi Won-bok and Koichi Takamura (Ko Kwang-il) in food directly shows the difference of the cultural transformation model they experience in Japan. Unlike the first generation of Korean residents in Japan, the second generation of Korean residents in Japan shows the appearance of marginalization. The second generation of Koreans living in Japan can be said to be a generation separated from their native culture. Originally, young immigrants have a weaker cultural identity of their country of origin than older immigrants, and Koreans in Japan are more likely to be far from their native culture due to the fact that their settlement is a colonial host country and their home country is divided into the north and south. In addition, they were forced to be further alienated from their native culture due to the Korean government’s policy of considering Koreans living in Japan only as a subject of alertness and surveillance from the time of liberation to the 1980s. Next, as a result of Japanese society excluding Koreans living in Japan based on their racial superiority, Korean Residents in Japan fail to establish a normal relationship with Japanese culture. As such, the second generation of Korean residents in Japan, who are alienated from both their native and mainstream cultures, shows extreme marginalization. “I,” the focalizer of Yummeng, is also a marginalized existence, but it is distinguished from other Korean residents in Japan in that the marginalization at this time appears from the inside rather than the background of a specific scene of life. “I” can be said to be a divided existence of consciousness and unconsciousness, conditional and unconditional. In terms of impulse and instinct, they reject ‘Japanese things’ and aim for ‘Korean things’. However, in terms of consciousness, they think critically of South Korea even while comparing it with Japan. Due to this division, the path given to ‘I’ is not to become a Korean or a Japanese, but to not become a Korean or a Japanese. Such circumstances are compressed by the appearance of “I,” who wanders around downtown Tokyo alone with mixed feelings after returning Choi Won-bok, who returns home from Tokyo Station in the last scene of the work. Until now, the relationship between Korean society and Koreans living in Japan has been a one-sided relationship between subject and object. However, it can be seen that the reproduction of Koreans in Japan through the focus speaker “I,” which is a divided Korean resident in Japan, has a different context from the general reproduction so far."

In other words, this study aimed to explore whether the “Local Project” activities carried out by the startup based on creating shared value (CSV) created shared benefits and values between society and business. This study examined the CSV characteristics of the “Local Project” activities to examine whether a startup can carry out CSV activities and build a CSV business model based on those activities. CSV activities refer to a series of activities by a firm that takes the form of CSV and affects the business environment, including planning, producing, and operating programs like the “Local Project”. Through CSV activities, start-ups will receive a positive influence from being able to establish and promote a positive image of a company, to seize new business opportunities and to upgrade their business models. Through this, this study aims to face directly that startups can cultivate the capabilities of startups and that, through win-win development with the local community, startups can create complementary relationships with society rather than being unilaterally supported. The findings are as follows. First, the business model was expanded and transformed through the “Local Project: Making T-shirt Eco-bags.” Moreover, the purpose of the activity and the deduction of values, overall, have all taken the form of CSV, and can thus be regarded as a CSV activity. Second, in the “Local Project: Donation of Items Produced for Vulnerable Groups,” the social problems were not fundamentally solved. The purpose was merely a one-time event and therefore cannot be considered a CSV activity. In particular, the activity was focused only on “donation” in terms of social contribution, thereby not generating economic profits or changing the business model. Accordingly, it is more suitable to define it as a CSR activity. However, parts of the activity still had the characteristic of CSV. In conclusion, this study revealed that startups could perform CSR and CSV activities. Teaching CSV perspectives and activities should be provided for early-stage startups to upgrade their business model and enhance the competencies of the founder. Furthermore, since a combination of CSR and CSV can be found within a single activity, the society must support individual startups to produce maximum efficiency by subdividing and differentiating CSV activities into single or combined with CSR. This study has significance in that it has explored the win-win relationship between startups and society and pursued ways to promote business startups in terms of CSV while also discussing the need to include CSV-related education in entrepreneurship education in the future."

We analyzed the 83,943, 69,120, 31,500, 29,003, and 9,361 records from parity 1 through 5 provided by Dairy Cattle Improvement Center (DCIC), Korea. The categorical CE scores (1 to 5) were also linearly transformed via the snell procedure and analyzed alongside actual scores. A generalized linear model or GLM analysis was performed in the R software package to estimate the significance of predictor variables. The complete models included the fixed effects of calf sex (SEX), calf size (SIZE), gestation length group (GLEN), dam calving age (DAGE), calving year (YR), calving season (SEA), and calving herd (HERD). Both actual and linear-transformed phenotypes were fitted separately for individual parity datasets. CE rates differed across parity. Male calves tend to have larger body sizes and longer gestation periods. As a result, males were also more inclined to extreme CE. However, longer gestation lengths, irrespective of sex, were also associated with greater CE.The GLM analysis showed that the effect of HERD, SIZE and YR are significant across parities (P<0.05). However, the SEX effect was only non-significant at parity 3, whereas GLEN was significant only up to parity 3. The season effect was mostly non-significant at P<0.05. The DAGE effect was removed by stepwise regression for all datasets. The stepwise regression also retained similar factors for the best-fit models. However, despite some minor variations in model parameter estimates, the identified predictor variables were identical across actual and modified scores. It also indicates the possible use of similar independent variables for any genetic evaluation, regardless of CE datatype. This is the first in depth study on factors of CE in Korean Holstein. We, therefore, believe these findings on significant predictors could greatly assist in designing future genetic evaluations for calving difficulty."

In addition, the new coil can solve the measurement difficulties during the low-current of the existing air-core Rogowski Coil and the problem caused by the increase in the number of turns of the coil. In other words, we propose to develop a new mixed-type Rogowski Coil that mixes iron and air cores. This mixed coil has the advantages of air-core type Rogowski Coil without increasing volume and saturation. It also exhibits sufficient measurement precision even in a low-current range. For the development of the mixed coil, this research selected a conductor through which a class current of 1,000A may flow. When a 10~1,000A current is applied, a measurement coil model composed of three stack types measures an induced voltage to compare the accuracy of the measured current. In addition, the proposed model uses Finite Element Analysis to simulate the voltage induced in the coil and measures the waveform using an oscilloscope for the voltage waveform induced through the prototype. Hence, the proposed mixed-Rogowski Coil""s usefulness and the accuracy of the current measurement are verified by the Finite Element Analysis."
MLOps workflow language and platform for time series data anomaly detection,2022,[],,"In this study, we propose a language and platform to describe and manage the MLOps(Machine Learning Operations) workflow for time series data anomaly detection. Time series data is collected in many fields, such as IoT sensors, system performance indicators, and user access. In addition, it is used in many applications such as system monitoring and anomaly detection. In order to perform prediction and anomaly detection of time series data, the MLOps platform that can quickly and flexibly apply the analyzed model to the production environment is required. Thus, we developed Python-based AI/ML Modeling Language (AMML) to easily configure and execute MLOps workflows. Python is widely used in data analysis. The proposed MLOps platform can extract and preprocess time series data from various data sources (R-DB, NoSql DB, Log File, etc.) using AMML and predict it through a deep learning model. To verify the applicability of AMML, the workflow for generating a transformer oil temperature prediction deep learning model was configured with AMML and it was confirmed that the training was performed normally."

This study used the grounded theory method, and the central question of this study is how the Batak missionaries commit themselves to be missionaries. Through in-depth interviews with 30 Batak missionaries, about 1,300 pages of interview data were collected, and qualitative data analysis was conducted in the stages of conceptualization, categorization, structurization and theoreticalization, with 343 concepts, 42 subcategories, 11 categories, and 3 pattern was derived. The central phenomenon is ‘outgoing-immersion-communication’. The analysis results were verified by the study participants, qualitative research experts, and fellow missionaries. The commitment pattern of Batak missionaries is outgoing, immersion, and communication, and the commitment process consists of patterns of outgoing, immersion, and communication. The substantive theory of the commitment of the Batak missionaries was presented as a core category, storyline, and integrated model. The core category is ‘Communicating with God’s altruism beyond the boundaries of the one’s comfort zone’, and the integrated model is explained as spiritual transformation, altruistic transformation, missional transformation, and lifetime transformation. The missiological implications of Batak missionaries’ commitment are organized by outgoing, immersion, and communication patterns. This study provided a missiological and strategic perspective to Batak churches, prospective missionaries, and mission organizations by deriving a substantive theory of the missionary commitment of the Batak tribe, which has been rare in research data, and explaining it in connection with the missiology theory."

Specifically, the study focused on case analysis of  three companies that switched their sales approach to D2C and examined the consequences of this change in three areas: customer problem solving, centralization strategy, and purchasing strategy for value creation. First, the study revealed that all three case companies applied the D2C operational management strategy to effectively respond to customer requests. Second, since online platform operations of the firms were similar, a centralization strategy should be pursued with differentiated product composition or service for each company. Third, the three companies should have considered communication with customers through the purchasing process for value creation, which would have been an important strategy. Based on the case analysis, the following are suggested as four critical success factors for D2C operations management: implementation capability of advanced information and communication technology (ICT); data acquisition, analysis and utilization capability; agile response capability; and operations management capability. The results of this study provides strategic insights and basic guidelines required for D2C operations implementation to companies that are preparing or considering the transition to the D2C model."

Retail businesses have begun introducing with Digital Transformation through a strategy called Omni-channel that incorporates the benefits of both offline and online channels.Omni-channel provides multiple services at once with overlapped offline and online services, and it also may be used diversely depending on the user's channel selections. Therefore, offering a consistent experience from consumers’ purchasing patterns is a very difficult task. Thus, more research is needed on how to give customers a consistent experience by actualizing and standardizing tangible and intangible services. To this purpose, a tool is required to rapidly and simply visualize various consumer experiences.This study proposes a service modeling tool that verifies feasibility of introductory services in advance and covers the complete processes of usage using new technology through the Omni-channel services. Particularly, considering the tool’s practical value, a toolkit was developed to focus on easing difficulty of usage and enhancing work efficiency.Primarily, through literature review on digital transformation and omnichannel, the need for pre-confirmation of technical suitability and service visualization was recognized during the service planning. Furthermore, case studies were used to select representative cases of domestic and international Omni-channel services. These representative cases were analyzed undertaken using service modeling. Subsequently, through shareholder workshops and by analyzing the suitability of tools, the necessity for a new tool for service planning was justified in an Omni-channel context. Lastly, a toolkit that includes a Pre-Serviceblueprint Map, Service Planning Board, and Keyword Cards was created to simulate diverse Omni-channel services.Moreover, it's utility in practice has been proven through case studies and heuristic evaluations.The toolkit developed in this work solves the main issues with standard service modeling and introduces specific tools for an Omni-channel shopping environment.

As a result, it was confirmed that research has rapidly increased after 2022. The main keywords of the research topics were ‘second’, ‘life’, ‘learning’, ‘reality’, ‘metaverse’, ‘virtual’, ‘blockchain’, ‘nft’, ‘medical’, ‘avatar’, etc. The topic keywords ‘Second life & Education’ and ‘Virtual Reality & Medical’ accounted for a large proportion of 57%, followed by ‘Blockchain & Cryptocurrency’, ‘Avatar & Interaction’, and ‘Sensing and Device’. As a result of semantic analysis, current metaverse research is focused on application and utilization, and research on underlying technologies and devices is also active. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the commonalities and differences between domestic and foreign studies, and to study the application method considering the domestic environment. In addition, new jurisprudence research is more necessary along with predicting new problems.

Magnetic Characteristics of Biological Fluid in Nonlinear Thermally Radiated Blood Flow,2022,"['thermal radiation', 'uniform magnetic field', 'maxwell fluid', 'oblique stagnation point']",,The numerical solution of the flow non-Newtonian fluid induced by stretching sheet in the region of oblique stagnation point flow under inducement of externally applied uniform magnetic field orthogonal to the flow is presented. The analysis is made under the assumption of boundary layer which arrives to the system of partial differential equations which are then transformed to ordinary differential equations by using appropriate similarity transformations. The numerical solution of the modeled system of equation is obtained by parallel shooting technique and presented for different variations of involved parameters. It is noted that enhancement in magnetic field results in decrease in horizontal velocity and boundary layer becomes thinner. The obtained results are compared with the available results in the literature and found in excellent agreement in the limiting cases.

This paper examines the influence of the announcement of transforming locally unwanted land use on housing prices near Chang-dong Garage in Nowon-gu, Seoul.  The study site, a facility considered a LULU, has been receiving public attention for the past two decades. Focusing on the initial announcement date of the development plan which coincides with local elections in 2010, 2014, and 2018, apartment sales data in Nowon-gu are examined using Difference-in-Difference Hedonic price models.  The results showed that proximity to the garage location was negatively associated with the housing price in 2010, but its influence changed positively in the 2018 model. The findings imply that the influence of LULU on housing price can be changed by policy and environment development of a specific period and a refinement level of election pledges seem to be associated with the size of the influence."
Mast Cells Tryptase Promotes Intestinal Fibrosis in Natural Decellularized Intestinal Scaffolds,2022,"['Tissue engineering', 'Decellularization', '3D model', 'Intestinal fibrosis', 'Mast cell']",,"BACKGROUND: Standard two-dimensional (2D) culture has confirmed the mechanism of mast cells (MCs) in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the regulation of signaling responses of MCs may well differ in three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments. The aim of the study was to develop a 3D culture model based on decellularized intestinal scaffolds (DIS) and verify how MCs influenced fibroblasts phenotype in the 3D model.METHODS: DIS were achieved using the detergent technique and extracellular matrix (ECM) components were verified by histologic analysis, quantification and scanning electron microscope. After human colon fibroblasts recellularized into the scaffolds and activated by MCs tryptase and TGFb1, the changes in genes and signaling pathways during fibroblasts activation in 3D were studied and compared with the changes in 2D cell culture on plastic plates.RESULTS: Decellularization process effectively removed native cell debris while retaining natural ECM components and structure. The engrafted fibroblasts could penetrate into the scaffolds and maintain its phenotype. No matter whether fibroblasts were cultured in 2D or 3D, MCs tryptase and transforming growth factor b1 (TGF-b1) could promote the differentiation of fibroblasts into fibrotic-phenotype myofibroblasts through Akt and Smad2/3 signaling pathways. Furthermore, the pro-collagen1a1 and fibronectin synthesis of myofibroblasts in 3D was higher than in 2D culture.CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the DIS can be used as a bioactive microenvironment for the study of intestinal fibrosis, providing an innovative platform for future intestinal disease modeling and screening of genes and signaling pathways."

A multi-domain diagnostic framework for CRD fuel injection systems under water-in-diesel emulsion fuel conditions,2022,"['Common rail', 'Continuous wavelet transform', 'Short-time fourier transform', 'Spectral analysis', 'Fault detection and isolation', 'Water-emulsified diesel fuel']",,"From a global perspective, combustion emission from diesel engines has negatively impacted our environment as observed from the increasing global warming and other environmental pollution. In the quest for mitigating these consequences, diesel emulsification offers a cost-efficient and eco-friendly alternative but the corrosion, wear, and power loss effects on the engine pose a strong concern for global adoption. In the right proportions and mixing conditions, water-in-diesel (WiD) emulsion fuels can offer long-term solutions to reducing the number of combustion residuals-nitrogen oxides (Nox), particulate matter (PM), carbon oxides (COx) and with appropriate condition monitoring techniques in place, engine efficiency can be maintained. Interestingly, the rail pressure sensor (RPS) of a common rail (CR) diesel engine reflects the underlying transient and spectral dynamics in the CR system at varying engine speeds and WiD emulsion compositions and when properly harnessed can be used for condition monitoring/diagnosis. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-based diagnostic framework for CR diesel engines that functions on the use of continuous wavelet coefficients (CWCs) and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) outputs from the first-order derivatives of the RPS signals. Following an investigative experiment on a KIA Sorento 2004 four-cylinder line engine at various WiD emulsion compositions at various engine RPMs, diagnostic results show that exploring a multi-domain approach of feature extraction offers more discriminative diagnostic parameters thereby providing a wider perspective to condition monitoring and with the robustness of ML classifiers, accurate diagnostics can be achieved. A comparative assessment using global and local evaluation tools reveal the diagnostic performances of the ML algorithms and the trustworthiness of the most accurate model- random forest (RF) with a test accuracy of 96.65 % following a grid search against the other widely-used ML-based diagnostic tools."

Economic impact of digitalization on agriculture: a Korean perspective,2022,"['CGE (computable general equilibrium) model', 'COVID-19', 'digital transformation', 'Korean agriculture']",,"The global trade environment is rapidly changing. The spread of COVID-19 promotes digitalization, and online transactions are becoming the new normal. Currently, Korea is actively introducing information and communication technology (ICT) that uses the internet of things (IoT) in relation to agriculture. However, few studies have analyzed the impact of digitalization on trade in the agricultural sector. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine how the introduction of digital technology can affect the economy and trade of Korea. In this study, we estimate the impact of introducing digital technologies using the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The results of this analysis indicate that the GDP could increase by 3.82% to 10.53%. Also, agricultural production and trade according to the model will significantly increase to 8.67% and 5.72%, respectively, through a productivity increase from Blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, despite logistics inefficiencies.Although the effects of digitalization could be significant, farmers are still struggling to introduce digital technologies, stemming from the fact that government support systems are concentrated in only a few sub-sectors. In this regard, support in this area must be expanded and diversified according to the current environment of agriculture in Korea."

The research discusses why future literacy is necessary as the ability to imagine the future beyond the existing paradigm or detect and perceive phenomena that cannot be explained by existing educational models, and the importance of restoring aesthetics that enable space, people, and education through art. Based on this, as a methodical example of art education for future coex- istence, the direction of instruction based on challenge-based learning using digital from the per- spective of participation in art education and practice was presented. As a result of this study, art ed- ucation has faithfully fulfilled the role of restoring humanity based on traditional humanism, but it needs an approach to apply a more expanded concept of art in terms of posthuman sensitivity by in- sighting the future with the confusion and open possibilities of digital transformation. Second, if the creation of a new future that breaks down the dependency between humans and technology with posthuman art becomes possible in the act and practice of art, art education practice should be im- plemented to recognize life as an expanded concept of the future and create an ecosystem beyond the boundaries of virtual creatures. Third, it is possible to practice art education for future coex- istence through communication and aesthetic recovery of art in the digital transformation era by re- flecting various sensory perceptions and aesthetics of art creation with digital technology."

The morphology module is composed of min-pooling layers and max-pooling layers, which shows the effect of morphological transformation. The edge-enhanced module is composed of convolution layers, which has the fixed weights of the traditional edge detection algorithm. After comparing the accuracy of various versions of each module for U-Net, we found that the optimal combination is the case that the morphology module of min-pooling and successive layers of min-pooling and max-pooling, and the edge-enhanced module of Scharr filter were the inputs of conv9.

Fractional Radioactive Decay Law and Bateman equations,2022,"['Bateman equations', 'Fractional Calculus', 'Radioactive decay law', 'Memory-effects', 'Non-Markovian process', 'Mittag-Leffler']",,"The aim of this work is to develop the fractional Bateman equations, which can model memory effects insuccessive isotopes transformations. Such memory effects have been previously reported in the alpha decay,which exhibits a non-Markovian behavior. Since there are radioactive decay series with consecutive alphadecays, it is convenient to include the mentioned memory effects, developing the fractional Bateman Equations,which can reproduce the standard ones when the fractional order is equal to one. The proposed fractionalmodel preserves the mathematical shape and the symmetry of the standard equations, being the onlydifference the presence of the Mittag-Leffler function, instead of the exponential one. This last is a veryimportant result, because allows the implementation of the proposed fractional model in burnup and activationcodes in a straightforwardway.Numerical experiments showthat the proposed equations predict highdecay rates for small timevalues, in comparisonwith the standard equations,which have high decay rates forlarge times. This work represents a novelty approach to the theory of successive transformations, and opensthe possibility to study properties of the Bateman equation from a fractional approach"

In addition, museums envision a ‘metaverse’ that can communicate and expand the obscure museum space to an infinite virtual space, and a museum that can provide a variety of museum experiences by hyper-connecting and hyper-personalizing it with AI. At the same time, museums are researching ways to transform themselves into cultural and artistic institutions that realize more inclusive values and open a sustainable future. Visitors, including the digital-native MZ generation and AI-native Alpha generation, are also getting evolved with these technologies. However, the reality of the university museum, which has to integrate digital technology and collections and communicate with evolving visitors, is not easy.This thesis considered the direction that university museums should go, aiming for inclusive values, despite the current difficult reality of the times. The concept of an inclusive museum, which is the background of this orientation, was summarized. In addition, this paper examined the exhibition of the Ewha Womans University Museum, which realized the inclusive value of the museum and looked for experiments by allowing visitors to participate in various ways and combining the participation results and collections with various technologies. These exhibitions are the crowd curation exhibition “You are invited as a curator”, the exhibition curation recommendation model “We Will Recommend a Special Exhibition Curated for You” (2017), and the outdoor exhibition “Connecting from the Street: Traditional and Contemporary Utopia Connecting to AR” (2022).“Visitor literacy” is important along with “digital transformation” for university museums that must respond to the flow of the digital era and the pandemic era. In order to realize inclusive value, university museums should have the ability to induce participation of visitors to communicate with them and create various opportunities for cooperation through their wisdom and digital technology. If university museums continue to develop literacy and communicate with the cultural community based on the expertise they have accumulated so far, it will be the only strength of university museums that link museums and collections centered on visitors."

First, athe fluid domain excited by sloshing was modeled using a multiphase-thermal flow domain in which liquid hydrogen and hydrogen gas are in the saturated state. Both the the volume of fluid (VOF) and Eulerian-based multi-phase flow methods were applied to validate the accuracy of the pressure prediction. Second, it was indirectly shown that the fluid velocity prediction could be accurate by comparing the free surface and impact pressure from the computational fluid dynamics with those from the experimental results. Thereafter, the heat ingress from the external convective heat flux was reflected on the outer surfaces of the hydrogen tank. Eulerian-based multiphase-heat flow analysis was performed for a two-dimensional Type-C cylindrical hydrogen tank under rotational sloshing motion, and an inflation technique was applied to transform the fluid domain into a computational grid model. The heat exchange and heat flux in the hydrogen liquid-gas mixture were calculated throughout the analysis,, whereas the mass transfer and vaporization models were excluded to account for the pure heat exchange between the liquid and gas in the saturated state. In addition, forced convective heat transfer by sloshing on the inner wall of the tank was not reflected so that the heat exchange in the multiphase flow of liquid and gas could only be considered. Finally, the effect of sloshing on the amount of heat exchange between liquid and gas hydrogen was discussed. Considering the heat ingress into liquid hydrogen according to the presence/absence of a sloshing excitation, the amount of heat flux and BOG were discussed for each filling ratio."

The kinetics of adsorption was studied by pseudo-first and pseudosecond- order kinetics and the adsorption data was well in agreement with the pseudo-second-order model. The R2 values of 0.9971 and 0.9839 of the second order for EY and MB, respectively, were greater than that of the first order. To calculate the most suitable isotherm model for adsorption, the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms were applied and the data for both dyes fitted well with the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption capacities obtained from Langmuir isotherm for EY and MB were 555.55 and 250mg/g, respectively. Remarkably, 3.0mg/13mL of nanocomposite adsorbed 0.1mg/mL of EY and 0.04mg/mL of MB in the very short time of 10 and 15minutes, respectively. The high adsorption efficiency of GO/ZnO NCs suggests that they may be a useful adsorbent for the purification of industrial wastewater."

Meanwhile, under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, the arbitrability of disputes arising out of PPP contracts is not simply a Chinese domestic law issue. Can PPP contracts involving Chinese enterprises use arbitration seated in China as a mode of dispute resolution? According to Article V (2) of the New York Convention, arbitrability is based on the local laws of signatory states. If China takes the position that PPP contract disputes are non-arbitrable, international arbitration awards involving PPP contract disputes may not be recognized and enforced in China. After a long period of uncertainty, the PRC Supreme Court published a judicial interpretation on 10 Dec 2019, stipulating that PPP agreements “entered into by an administrative organ through consultation with a citizen, a legal person or any other organization that contains rights and obligations under administrative law in order to achieve the objectives of administrative management or public service” are classified as “administrative agreements”, and ensuing disputes would fall under the jurisdiction of administrative litigation. In light of this judicial interpretation, is there still room to argue in favour of arbitrability of PPP contract disputes in China? What would be theconsequences of this judicial interpretation which may affect international BRI projects? This paper aims to analyse the Supreme Court’s judicial interpretation and suggests possible areas for future reform."

Investigation of Torque Ripple in an Induction Motor with Respect to Slot Number Combinations,2022,"['Induction motor', 'torque ripple', 'flux density', 'slot combination']",,"In this study, the harmonic orders of varying magnetic flux density with respect to slot combinations are scrutinized through a spatial and temporal fast Fourier transform. A three-phase four-pole induction motor is selected, and, as its base model, 36 and 28 slots are set up in the stator and rotor, respectively. Eleven models with different numbers of rotor slots were designed to study torque ripples with respect to slot combinations. The correlation between torque ripple and slot harmonics in a stator and rotor is described thoroughly by comparing the tangential and radial magnetic flux densities in the air gap, tangential force density, and harmonic orders in torque. Some models having deteriorated torque ripples have one or more slot harmonic orders in common in the stator and rotor. The other models exhibit the same commonalities, but a small torque ripple occurs because of the high harmonic orders. Models with 24 stator slots are investigated through the same procedure to generalize the relationship between torque ripple and slot harmonics in 36 stator slots."

For this purpose, questionnaires were collected online from 408 beer consumers and empirically analyzed through the PLS-SEM model. As a result of the analysis, first, it was verified that digital transformation does not affect beer purchase motivation. Second, the fact that dynamic ability based on digital entrepreneurship has a positive effect on beer purchase motivation has been demonstrated. Third, it has been proven that ESG, a non-financial performance of sustainable management, does not affect beer purchase motivation. Based on such analysis results, this study suggests that top decision makers and corporate marketers cannot secure consumer satisfaction and loyalty if they adopt innovation-oriented only and ignore customer-oriented factors in order to enhance the purchasing motive power of beer consumers."

We present a trajectory tracking control method for UAV formation with preset performance function constraints. We first model the quadrotor UAV system with a dual closed-loop system with position outer loop and attitude inner loop. The performance constraint function transforms the output constraint problem into an unconstrained problem through error transformation. We show that the uncertain aerodynamic parameters and the external disturbance can be estimated by proper design of an exponential disturbance observer. To solve the trajectory tracking problem of the Leader UAV, we introduce a backstepping adaptive control (BC) based on the preset performance. Furthermore, to overcome the issue of the collision between aircrafts in the formation flying, the formation sliding mode control (SMC) based on the power approach rate is proposed. Such a mechanism ensures that the UAVs track their respective reference trajectories quickly, so as to achieve the desired formation. The effectiveness of the control strategy is investigated by simulation. In addition, the open-source autopilot as well as the formation control airborne computer, wireless communication links and used data packet structure are presented, and the designed control law is transplanted into the Pixhawk flight control processor.

CPC-DOX conjugate was suspended in PBS buffer and sonicated for formation of self-assembled nanoparticles. The size distribution and morphology of CPC-DOX nanoparticles were analyzed by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from CPC-DOX nanoparticles was evaluated using 1,2-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF). To confirm chemo-photodynamic therapeutic effects of CPC-DOX nanoparticles, cell viability and cancer growth were investigated on CT26 cells and a CT26 xenograft mouse model. The CPC-DOX conjugate was successfully synthesized by amide coupling reaction. The conjugate formed self-assembled nanoparticles in aqueous solution. In generation of ROS using DPBF, CPC-DOX nanoparticles exhibited significantly higher DPBF photobleaching effect than CPC. CPC-DOX nanoparticles significantly decreased cell viability in CT26 cells by generation of singlet oxygen after 635 nm near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation in vitro. CT26-bearing mice injected with CPC-DOX nanoparticles through the tail vein and irradiated with a 635 nm NIR laser showed the most cancer inhibition among all groups. In summary, nanoparticles formed from CPC-DOX conjugate have potential as novel chemo-photodynamic therapeutic agents for treating cancer."

Then, this study used AMOS 21 package to analyze the differences in path effects between groups through structural equation modeling."
Enhanced photocatalytic degradation of reactive blue 19 using zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 composited with Fe3O4/MnO2 heterojunction,2022,"['Photocatalytic degradation', 'Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8', 'Fe3O4/MnO2', 'Nanocomposite', 'Reactive blue 19']",,"The present study offers a novel recyclable Fe3O4/MnO2/ZIF-8 heterojunction photocatalyst for the degradationof reactive blue 19 (RB19) under visible light irradiation. The catalyst was facilely synthesized bydepositing Fe3O4/MnO2 nanocomposite onto the surface of ZIF-8 and characterized by field-emissionscanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and UV–vis spectroscopy.Morphology and structure characterization of the prepared photocatalyst indicated that polyhedralZIF-8 (ca. 500 nm) was coated by MnO2/Fe3O4 nanorods. The synergy effect of Fe3O4/MnO2/ZIF-8 compositeexhibited an excellent photocatalytic activity toward RB19 degradation of 99.5 % after 60 min of irradiationdue to high surface area and heterojunction formation. According to scavenger tests, thephotodegradation of RB19 dye over Fe3O4/MnO2/ZIF-8 was mainly contributed by OH and O2reactiveradicals. The kinetic study showed that the catalytic degradation of RB19 on Fe3O4/MnO2/ZIF-8 was betterdescribed by the first-order kinetic model. The new catalyst was easily recovered using an external magneticfield because of its magnetic properties. Besides, Fe3O4/MnO2/ZIF-8 showed high recyclability andstability, maintaining a high removal efficiency of 91.3 % even after ten repeated cycles. The overallresults indicated that the fabricated composite can be used as an efficient photocatalyst for treatingorganic dyes in wastewater."
Adsorption capacity of sodium dodecyl sulfate activation okara for methylene blue on aqueous solution,2022,"['Adsorption', 'Dye', 'Okara', 'SDS', 'Agricultural Waste']",,"Agricultural waste okara (OA) was selected as a precursor to prepare low-cost adsorbent for the removal of methylene blue (MB). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), as a kind of anionic surfactant, was loaded onto okara (SOA) to achieve high adsorption ability. Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and X-ray diffraction were investigated for the materials characterization. The effect of pH, contact time, initial concentration, adsorbent dose and ionic strength was determined to explore the adsorption properties. The adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms, cost analysis of adsorbent and adsorption mechanism were discussed.

Electromagnetic torque and reactive torque control of induction motor drives to improve vehicle variable flux operation and torque response,2022,"['Induction motor drives', 'Decoupling', 'Torque response', 'Variable flux', 'Reactive torque', 'Torque control']",,"This paper investigates the decoupling and fast torque response for induction motor drives during vehicle operation with variable flux. A torque control method considering flux transient information is proposed, which takes the electromagnetic torque and reactive torque as state variables for modeling and feedback linearization control. Since the electromagnetic torque is aligned with the active power, and the reactive torque is aligned with the reactive power and perpendicular to the electromagnetic torque, the stator dq-axis current control of the field-oriented control (FOC) is replaced by the simultaneous control of the electromagnetic torque and reactive torque. The physical concept of the inner loop changes from the current to the torque, and the modulation signals from the voltage-type to the power-type. This strategy improves the decoupling performance under variable flux, and the fast response capability of the torque. In addition, it eliminates the complex rotation coordinate transformation. A comparative experiment was carried out between the proposed method and the FOC. Both methods have good steady-state performance. However, the proposed method has better torque response and decoupling."

Thermal conversion ofcarbon precursor was investigated using thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.The amorphous carbon aerogel was made up of criss-crossing carbon ribbons and it had a typical micromesoporousstructure and a specific surface area of 575m2 g1. It exhibited remarkable optical absorption over 81.8%in the UV and Vis regions and over 70% in the NIR region. The surface temperature of dry CASol-Ads can achieve77.9 oC under 1 kW m2 irradiation. The hydrophilic 3D network structure of CASol-Ads provides a large volume for thestorage of liquids; thus, the carbon aerogel was able to store as much as 13.4 times its own weight in water.

Mannose Attenuates Colitis-Associated Colorectal Tumorigenesis by Targeting Tumor-Associated Macrophages,2022,"['Colorectal cancer', 'Mannose', 'Tumor-associated macrophages', 'Lactate']",,"Mannose has recently drawn extensive attention for its substantial anti-cancer activities, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mannose on experimental colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis and underlying mechanisms. Data clearly showed that at plasma concentrations achieved after oral administration, mannose slightly affected malignancy of tumor cells or tumor promoter-induced transformation of pre-neoplastic cells, but substantially suppressed manifestation of the M2-like phenotype of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in a cancer cell and macrophage co-culture model. Mechanistically, mannose might greatly impair the production of tumor cell-derived lactate which has a critical role in the functional polarization of TAMs. Importantly, oral administration of mannose protected mice against colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis by normalizing TAM polarization. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of TAMs in colorectal tumorigenesis, and provide a rationale for introducing mannose supplementation to patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases"

Lead iron niobate (PFN) belongs to the family of multiferroic electroceramics with perovskite structure having formulation ABO 3 or A(B′B″)O3, where B′ and B″ are, respectively, low and high valence cati- ons like Fe 3+ and Nb 5+. The 3d 5 electrons of Fe 3+ boosts magnetic orders and the 6s 2 electrons of Pb 2+ generate the ferroelectric orderings [ 1 ]. PFN ceramics are widely used in device applications [ 2 –4 ] such as multilayer capaci- tors, actuators, transducers and so on due to their large values of relative permittivity, diﬀ use phase transition Vol.:(0123456789) 1 3 using Mulliken’s model. The evaluated conduction band minimum level is suﬃ ciently negative with respect to the H (0 eV) level, which strongly signiﬁ es the possible occurrence of the photocatalytic hydrogen emission reaction. A detailed electrical analysis was done to study the dielectric properties, relaxation, negative temperature coeﬃ cient of resistance (NTCR)-type response and DC conductivity. AC conductivity studies revealed the presence of overlapping large polaron tun- nelling (OLPT) model. The eﬀ ect of oxygen vacancies on relaxation and its correlation with activation energy were discussed.Multiferroic nature was conﬁ rmed from room temperature studies of P–E and M–H hysteresis loops. Fe 3+ Fe 3+ (F centre) exchange and Fe 3+ Fe 2+ double exchange mechanisms were discussed. A magnetic improvement was noticed on reduction of temperature to 50 K. The simultaneous existence of weak ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism is one of the interesting outcomes of the present study, which may provide a new multiferroic material for advanced electro-optical applications."

Asynchronous H∞ Dynamic Output Feedback Control for Markovian Jump Neural Networks with Time-varying Delays,2022,"['Dynamic output feedback control', 'linear matrix inequality', 'Markovian jump system', 'time-varying delay', 'neural networks.']",,"In this paper, the problem of asynchronous robust H∞ dynamic output feedback control for Markovian jump neural networks with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties and mode-dependent time-varying delays is investigated. The improved delay-dependent stochastic stability conditions and bounded real lemma are obtained by introducing the relaxation variables, which reduces the conservatism caused by boundary technology and model transformation. An improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed using linear matrix inequalities. On this basis, the solution of robust H∞ dynamic output feedback problem and sufficient conditions for solving the problem of asynchronous dynamic output feedback controller are given respectively. Asynchronous dynamic output feedback controller is constructed to ensure that the closed-loop mode-dependent time-varying delays Markovian jump neural networks achieve different convergence speeds. The given H∞ performance index is satisfied for the delays not bigger than a given upper bound.

With the development of imaging methods for DAS data, full waveform inversion (FWI) is been applied to DAS data to obtain high-resolution property models such as P- and S-velocity. However, because the DAS systems measure strain from the phase distortion between two points along optical cables, DAS data must be transformed from strain to particle velocity for FWI algorithms. In this study, a plane-wave FWI algorithm based on the relationship between strain and horizontal particle velocity in the plane-wave assumption is proposed to apply FWI to DAS data. Under the plane-wave assumption, strain equals the horizontal particle velocity, which is scaled by the velocity at the receiver position. This relationship was confirmed using a numerical experiment. Furthermore, 4-layer and modified Marmousi-2 velocity models were used to verify the applicability of the proposed FWI algorithm in various survey environments. The proposed FWI was implemented in land and marine survey environments and provided high-resolution P- and S-velocity models."
Development of Toxoplasma gondii Chinese I genotype Wh6 Strain in Cat Intestinal Epithelial Cells,2022,"['Toxoplasma gondii', 'cat intestinal epithelial cell', 'development', 'oocyst excretion', 'Chinese 1 genotype Wh6 strain']",,"Felids are the unique definitive host of Toxoplasma gondii. The intestine of felid is the only site for initiating Toxoplasma gondii sexual reproduction. T. gondii excretes millions of infectious oocysts from the intestine, which are the primary source of infection. There are many difficulties in developing vaccines and drugs to control oocyst excretion due to the lack of an appropriate experimental model. Here, we established an in vitro feline intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) infection system and an efficient animal model of T. gondii Chinese 1 genotype, Wh6 strain (TgCtwh6). The Kunming mice brain tissues containing TgCtwh6 cysts were harvested 42-day post-infection. The bradyzoites were co-cultured with cat IECs in vitro at a ratio of 1:10. Five 3-month-old domestic cats were orally inoculated with 600 cysts each. The oocysts were detected by daily observation of cat feces by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. We found that the parasite adhered and invaded cat IECs in vitro, transformed into tachyzoites, and then divided to form rose-like structures. These parasites eventually destroyed host cells, escaped, and finished the asexual reproduction process. Schizonts associated with sexual reproduction have not been observed during development in vitro cultured cells. However, schizonts were detected in all infected cat intestinal epithelial cells, and oocysts were presented in all cat feces. Our study provides a feasible cell model and an efficient infection system for the following studies of T. gondii sexual reproduction, and also lays a foundation to develop drugs and vaccines for blocking excretion and transmission of oocysts."

Hyaluronic acid encapsulated aminated mesoporous silica nanoparticles for pH-responsive delivery of methotrexate and release kinetics,2022,"['aminated mesoporous silica nanoparticles', 'electrostatic interactions', 'hyaluronic acid', 'pH-responsive delivery', 'release kinetics']",,"A simple drug controlled delivery system is facilely designed for pH-responsive delivery of methotrexate (MTX), an anticancer drug. Aminated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (AMSNs) were first synthesized for the loading of MTX, and then the MTX-loaded AMSN (AMSN-MTX) was encapsulated with hyaluronic acid (HA) through electrostatic attractions. Successful preparation of the HAencapsulated AMSN-MTX (AMSN-MTX-HA) is confirmed by different characterizations such as scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, x-ray diffraction, and so on. Because the protonation/deprotonation of HA is closely related to pH, the electrostatic interactions between HA and AMSN depend closely on the pH of the medium and thus pH-responsive delivery of MTX is achieved. The release kinetic data of MTX from the carrier fit well to Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas models. Cell experiments indicate that the developed AMSN-MTX-HA displays high inhibitory effect on hepatoma (SMMC-7721) cells while the drug-free carrier of AMSN-HA has good biocompatibility."

In this paper, a study on cable tension estimation using the built-in accelerometer and camera in a smartphone was conducted. For the experimental study, visual displacement measurement using a smartphone camera and acceleration measurement using a built-in accelerometer were performed in the cable-stayed bridge model. The estimated natural frequencies and transformed tensions from these measurements were compared with the theoretical values and results from the normal visual displacement method. Through comparison, it can be seen that the error between the method using the smartphone and the normal visual displacement is sufficiently small to be acceptable. It has also been shown that those errors are much smaller than the difference between the values calculated by the theoretical model. These results show that the deviation according to the type of measurement method is not large and it is rather important to use an appropriate mathematical model. In conclusion, in the case of cable tension estimation, it can be said that the visual displacement measurement and acceleration using a smartphone can be a sufficiently applicable method, just like the normal visual displacement method. It is also noteworthy that the smartphone accelerometer has a larger magnitude error and has more limitations such as high-frequency sampling instability compared to the visual displacement method, but shows almost the same performance as the visual displacement method in this cable tension estimation."

The jurisprudential approach derived from the Harvard social studies project is a complex product of some kind of methodology and philosophy. In order to understand its substance as a system, it is necessary to categorize the branches of understanding on the jurisprudential approach and to weave its meaning together. This paper tried to understand the meaning of the jurisprudential approach in the categories of ‘curriculum’ and ‘model of thinking’, and to propose an expanded concept in the dimension of ‘instructional methodology’ based on the contextual review. To this end, the major works of the Harvard social studies project and authors’ retrospects after the project are comprehensively reviewed, and they are reinterpreted in the context of the issues-centered social studies education. The jurisprudential approach is the logic of the issues-centered curriculum development in the context of establishing identity of social studies, and it is the framework for comprehensive thinking in terms of thinking model. In a larger context, from the perspective of educational methodological transformation, the jurisprudential approach is understood as the education for new progressivism and an attempt to apply informal thinking to education. In the pedagogical context, each meaning of the jurisprudential approach supports the identity of social studies for citizenship education, which has the character of general education.

Study on Multi-Field Coupled Evolution Mechanism of Laser Irradiated 40Cr Steel Quenching Process Based on Phase Change Induced Plasticity,2022,['40Cr gear steel · Disk laser · Multi-field coupling · Phase change induced plastic stress'],,"40Cr is essential to steel for the manufacture of hardened gears, and optimizing its laser quenching process will be of greatsignificance for gear wear and life extension. However, the complete reliance on the experimental trial-and-error approachdoes not effectively reveal the mechanism of the evolution of the laser quenching process in disk laser. Numerical simulationprovides an effective way to obtain the transient evolution of the laser quenching process. In this paper, the temperaturechanges physical parameters of the quenched material are calculated based on the CALPHAD method. Establish a thermoelastic–plastic multi-field coupling model for the laser hardening process of the disk laser 40Cr gear steel. Perform thenumerical calculations on the transient temperature, martensite phase fraction, and the transformation-induced plasticitystress evolution of the 40Cr laser hardening process. Focus on the mechanism of the mutual coupling between phase changebehavior and plastic strain. Calculations show that there is heat accumulation during quenching, with a peak temperatureof 1448 K. Plastic stress has a “hump” distribution, with a peak value of 834 MPa, which is 1.25 mm from the center ofthe focal point. The experimental analyses of the 40Cr gear steel quenching microstructure and hardness distribution stateby the Axioskop2 scanning electron microscope, the KEYENCE VH-Z100R super depth of field 3D microscope, and theQ10M microhardness tester reveal the mechanical behavior of the material and the phase hardening law during the quenchingprocess. That provided an essential theoretical basis for effective prediction on quenching residual stress and optimizingindustrial production parameters."
An effective method for accurate nymphal-stage delimitation of the cicada Hyalessa fuscata,2022,['Life-stage delimitation Principal component analysis K-means clustering Linear regression Hyalessa fuscata'],,"Subterranean nymphal development in cicadas presents challenges to researchers in accurately estimating the number of their developmental stages, although such information is crucial to understanding and predicting their population dynamics. While most studies have relied on head width as an attribute for life-stage determination to date, such character in cicadas can be highly variable and thus differentiation solely based on such morphology is prone to subjectivity in practice. Here, we propose a reliable method for instar estimation that is applicable to Hyalessa fuscata nymphs. We first obtained morphometrics of nymphs in all stages. Second, we computed logarithm-transformation and principal component analysis to extract a transformed variable that captures most of the variance of morphological characteristics. Third, k-means were computed to divide the dataset into distinct clusters assuming four-, five- and six life-stage scenarios for the best interferences of life stages. Finally, simple linear regression analysis was conducted to compare and select the best fit model. Our result shows that five nymphal stages best fit for H. fuscata nymphs. This method is expected to provide an easy-to-handle ecological tool for the study of life history of cicadas as well as other insects that have long life cycles and multiple developmental stages."
Preparation of chromium fumarate metal-organic frameworks for removal of pharmaceutical compounds from water,2022,"['Metal-organic Frameworks', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Chromium Fumarate', 'Adsorption']",,"Pharmaceutical pollution in water is the major cause of antibiotic resistance, so remediation of water from pharmaceuticals is a very important issue. Different methods are used for this purpose, with adsorption as one of the most preferred. Different adsorbents have been used for water treatment processes. Metal-organic frameworks that have highly porous structures have gained attention in the last decades. In this study, novel chromium fumarate (Cr- Fum) was prepared, and the efficiency of Cr-Fum was tested by ciprofloxacin (CPX) adsorption. Cr-Fum was prepared under reflux and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).The general approach of the process was monolayer adsorption at low temperature and heterogeneous adsorption at high temperature. 2.5mg of adsorbent was adsorbed 4.97mg/g and 11.47% of CPX. 10mg of Cr-Fum was adsorbed 0.82mg/g and 7.27% of CPX. Partition coefficients were calculated and 0.07mg/g/M was found at 298 K. The reaction followed pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the reaction is spontaneous and exothermic. Additional ions caused decreasing CPX adsorption, but this study showed that Cr- Fum has NaCl adsorption capacity. In future studies, NaCl adsorption should be investigated. Desorption studies were applied to Cr-Fum after the adsorption processes. 0.1M NaOH and phosphate buffer (pH=7.4) solution were used as desorption eluents. The desorption period was chosen as 6 h. NaOH solution desorbed 67.38% of CPX at first cycle and buffer solution desorbed 26.87% of CPX at second cycle."

The NiO/F-MWCNTs nanocomposite was synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method after functionalization of MWCNTs using sulfuric acid and nitric acid and utilized as an efficient surface to adsorption of malachite green dye from polluted water. The nanocomposite sample was characterized using several techniques are X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), High- resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis, Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) analysis and Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). The analytical results showed that the prepared nanocomposite is of good crystalline nature with a particle size of 25.43 nm. A significant specific surface area was 412.08 m2/g which indicates the effective impact of the nanocomposite in the adsorption of malachite green (MG) dye. On the other hand, the effect of adsorbent dose, temperature, acidic function and contact time on the adsorption efficiency of dye was studied. The kinetics of dye adsorption were also investigated employing two kinetic models, pseudo-first-order model and pseudo-second-order model. Finally, the thermodynamic functions were determined to identify the type of the reaction and the spontaneity of the process."

The current commercial formulation contains a substantial amount of solubilizing excipients that could cause systemic anaphylaxis and cardiovascular side effects. Nanocrystal formulation is an ideal alternative to circumvent excipient-related problems, and it could also take advantage of the defective vascular architecture of solid tumors through enhanced permeability and retention. In the present study, we combined phase separation and high-pressure homogenization processes to generate docetaxel nanocrystals (ca. 200 nm). The initial phase separation of docetaxel from the solution with 1-tetradecanol produced an amorphous nano-precursor in the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), which was subsequently transformed into the nanocrystals during the high-pressure homogenization. The nanocrystals exhibited a promising anti-cancer effect with minimal damage to normal tissue when tested with a chicken chorioallantoic membrane model."

"ACOUSTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ABNORMAL COMBUSTION IN A HIGH-COMPRESSION RATIO, SPARK-IGNITION ENGINE",2022,"['Engine knocking', 'Combustion sound', 'Spectral analysis', 'Autocorrelation']",,"Engine knocking is often identified by an operator based on the combustion sound emanating from the cylinder block during engine calibration in a test cell. Such human-hearing-based acoustic knock determination is considered the most reliable real-time knock-monitoring method, and it is necessary for selecting an accurate spark timing. In this study, the characteristics of this combustion sound were investigated. To this end, a normal engine calibration experiment was conducted. The engine sound was recorded under various operating conditions by using a copper tube attached to the cylinder block and the microphone of a smartphone. The measured signals were subjected to acoustic analyses, including Fast Fourier transform, smoothing, spectral analysis, and autocorrelation, to compare the sounds recorded at the knock borderline with those recorded in the cases with significantly advanced spark timing. The results of these analyses revealed several features that distinguished the knock sound from the normal combustion sound. The knock sound exhibited distinctions in a high-frequency band between 6,000 and 8,000 Hz. These features can be used to develop effective knock classification models."

Nowadays, these systems have become more critical for autonomous cars. In recent years, many advanced lane detection and tracking methods have been studied. However, most approaches focus on detecting lanes by performing conventional image processing on a single frame. Often, the lack of distinguishing features and the presence of extreme weather conditions such as dense rain or snow makes these algorithms lose their accuracy. In this work, deep learning is merged as a tool to address these issues. A modified version of the LaneNet algorithm was designed as a road lane detector, in which the front image was passed as input to the encoder model. Consequently, the road lanes could be robustly detected even if they were discrete or unclear. For lane curvature estimation, a Kalman filter was utilized, which took the results obtained from the LaneNet detection module as input. The detection results were compared with those obtained using the conventional Hough transformation. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
다성분계 물성을 예측하기 위한 BaTiO3기반 계산과학 플랫폼 구축,2022,"['Multilayer ceramic capacitors', 'BaTiO3 material', 'Special quasirandom structures', 'The first-principles calculations']",,"Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is considered to be a beneficial ceramic material for multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) applications because of its high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss. Numerous attempts have been made to improve the physical properties of BaTiO3 in response to recent market trends by employing multicomponent alloying strategies. However, owing to its significantnumber of atomic combinations and unpredictable physical properties, finding a traditional experimental approach to develop multicomponent systems is difficult; the development of such systems is also time-consuming. In this study, 168 new structures were fabricated using special quasi-random structures (SQSs) of Ba1-xCaxTi1-yZryO3, and 1680 physical properties were extracted from first-principles calculations. In addition, we built an integrated database to manage the computational results, and will provide big data solutions by performing data analysis combined with AI modeling. We believe that our research will enable the global materials market to realize digital transformation through datalization and intelligence of the material development process."

To monitor the port structure, especially the rubber fender, a fender segmentation system using a vision sensor and deep learning method has been proposed in this study. For fender segmentation, a new deep learning network that improves the encoder-decoder framework with the receptive field block convolution module inspired by the eccentric function of the human visual system into the DenseNet format has been proposed. In order to train the network, various fender images such as BP, V, cell, cylindrical, and tire-types have been collected, and the images are augmented by applying four augmentation methods such as elastic distortion, horizontal flip, color jitter, and affine transforms. The proposed algorithm has been trained and verified with the collected various types of fender images, and the performance results showed that the system precisely segmented in real time with high IoU rate (84%) and F1 score (90%) in comparison with the conventional segmentation model, VGG16 with U-net.

According to previous studies, companies are active in technological innovation when they can appropriate the outcome of innovation and when they have complementary assets (marketing, manufacturing capabilities, etc.) that can convert the innovation into value. The effect of these two conditions to join platform ecosystem is investigated. The duplication between the ISV’s product portfolio and platform service is also included as an independent variable. The two sample groups are composed of independent SW companies that signed a partner agreement with platform companies and non-participating companies in the platform. As a result of empirical study, it is found that the patent rights do not affect participation in the platform. The ISVs might have believed that the benefits from cooperation with platform companies are greater than the risks of exposure to innovative technologies and unique Biz models. On the other hand, downstream's capability and the duplication of product portfolio affect participation in the platform. If ISVs have the downstream capability to transform cooperation into value creation, ISVs are actively participating in the platform. In addition, cooperation is active when the product portfolio is complementary to platform service rather than competition. This study is the empirical study of open innovation between Korean independent software companies and digital platform companies. There are similar prior studies abroad, but there are no similar studies in Korea. It is meaningful in that the determinants of platform ecosystem participation were investigated through empirical analysis by composing a sample group of companies participating in the platform ecosystem and companies not participating in the platform ecosystem."
Who benefits from acquisitions of a software target - Hardware Firm or Software Firm Acquirer?,2022,"['기업인수합병', 'IT기업', '시너지효과', '누적초과수익률', 'corporate mergers and acquisitions', 'information technology (IT) firms', 'synergy effect', 'abnormal stock returns']",,"In this paper, we examine the effects of the acquirer’s wealth based on 3,442 transactions of the tech companies between 2003 and 2020. Despite the strategic moves of tech companies that have long shaped the competitive dynamics of the IT industry, the value created from the acquisition of software companies has been the least studied. Thus, we examined both the hardware and software sectors to determine whether the acquisition of software firms is value enhancing. Specifically, we explored whether acquisitions of software targets are beneficial to the acquiring technology firms’ shareholders and whether acquisitions of software firms bring different returns for software versus hardware tech firms. The purpose of this study was to test whether software firms and hardware firms yield positive abnormal returns from acquiring software targets in the U.S. M&A market.Event study methodology and regression model were used in this study, In particular, we applied the event study methodology to calculate the abnormal returns for acquirers around the announcement day, which is used as the dependent variable in this research model. Our results showed that the synergy effects enjoyed by the acquirer around the merger and acquisition announcement yielded positive returns for software firms when the firms acquired software targets. However, we did not find a comparable level of synergy gains around announcement dates when hardware firms acquired software targets. The findings have important implications for strategic decisions of mergers and acquisitions in the IT industry.This study contributes to the M&A literature in IS by narrowing the acquirers to software and hardware companies in the U.S. market. The acquisition of the target, the software business, was used to explicitly compare the different yields for the two types of acquirers. The theoretical explanation for the stock market reactions was given, as well as the empirical evidence to support the hypotheses. In the IS literature, insufficient research has been conducted to link different types of IT firms’ expansion of software through M&A transactions, nor have the theoretical grounds been developed to explain whether, how, and why software target acquisitions affect acquirer performance. This study contributes to the literature by theoretically explaining and empirically validating the link between tech companies’ foundational product sector and the performance of software-led M&As. In examining short-run abnormal returns, because of the organizational dissimilarities between hardware tech acquirers and software targets, the potential for synergy creation may be thwarted. These results serve as a cautionary tale to hardware-based tech companies. Although it may be tempting for firms to veer into either IT convergence, the subscription business, digital transformation, or acquisition of new information technologies such as artificial intelligence, which are the trajectories set by tech giants, there is a steep learning curve for mastering a viable software-centric business model. The mastery required in manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, marketing, and distribution may already be challenging for some hardware companies. Even with their top-notch financial, experiential, and human resources, the hardware firms included in the analyses could not reach the full potential of the software-led expansion approach. The detrimental stock returns experienced by some of the hardware firms’ acquisitions in the analyses could prove fatal to less established tech companies."

The spectrum from the univariate wavelet analysis of raw time series was extended for a hypothetical long-term, and an inverse transform method was adopted. Three methods considered for spectral extraction were “Method (1): randomized by setting different block lengths for each scale,” “Method (2): randomized by setting the same block length for all scales,” and “Method (3): simultaneously randomized by setting same block length for all scales.” To verify these methods, we generated non-stationary time series through nonlinear moving average and nonlinear autoregressive models. The application results of the time series were compared with the distribution and bivariate analysis results of the raw data. Method (1) and (2) exhibited a part that could not mimic the raw data distribution owing to various reasons, such as the disconnection of the spectrum. However, bivariate wavelet analysis confirmed that the raw data distribution and co-movement characteristics of the spectrum could be sufficiently preserved in Method (3)."
Research on bolt contour extraction and counting of locomotive running gear based on deep learning,2022,"['Semantic segmentation', 'Target count', 'Locomotive running gear', 'Daily maintenance', 'Deeplearning', 'Feature fusion']",,"The detection of abnormal running gear is essential to a locomotive’s daily maintenance, with the posture and quantity of various small bolts being important indicators to judge whether the locomotive is running safely. Traditional detection algorithms are easily affected by light changes, stain coverage, and image distortion, which is difficult to meet the detection requirements. Thus this paper proposes a deep learning based on bolt detection method that is appropriate for locomotive running gears. First, a bolt segmentation network was developed based on an improved U-netthat compensates the image information loss after multiple cross fusions involving the fusion of front and back convolution layer feature images. Furthermore, the proposed network utilizes the PReLU activation function and employs the concept structure to optimize the convolution method. This strategy aims to improve further the model’s segmentation accuracy and convergence speed. On this basis, we exploited several morphological transformations to improve the contour detection accuracy and ensure the bolt counting accuracy. The experimental results on the mainline running train data highlight that, compared with U-net, the proposed network’s recall rate and the mean intersection over union value are increased by 5.38 and 14.3, respectively. Furthermore, the bolt counting method’s loss function and mean absolute errors are significantly reduced compared with the contour extraction algorithm."

According to this issue, the proportion of solar energy is expanding due to its high business potential among renewable energies, and various works have been proposed to precisely predict solar power generation for efficient energy management and stable power supply. However, previous works include data of night time when solar power is not generated, and this method leads to low forecasting accuracy. Also, they have limitations in explaining how the forecasting results are derived. To solve these problems, we propose a solar power generation forecasting scheme based on explainable AI(Artificial Intelligence) reflecting time period patterns of the sun. We selected time pattern variables showing high correlation with solar power generation and transformed them into a pattern reflecting the solar cycle. We then excluded data of night time and compared the performances of various machine learning models. Experimental results proved that utilizing LightGBM with only daytime input variables showed the best forecasting performance, and solar radiation had the most significant influence among the input variables."

In line with the demands of the times for new characters that transcend typical heroic character images, it is predicted that demon-shaped antihero characters will be visualized more diversely in the future. Continuous demand is expected in various media content industries such as movies, dramas, games, and webtoons, and it is hoped that this study will be used as a reference in the process of character development and visualization of similar genres, which will be conducted in collaboration with Korea or abroad."
Particle Swarm Optimization-based dummy sub-carriers insertion for peak to average power ratio reduction in OFDM systems,2022,"['AWGN', 'Clipping technique', 'OFDM', 'PAPR', 'Particle Swarm', 'PTS', 'SLM']",,"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the best choice for wireless and wired high data rate communications. The OFDM system has many advantages such as high spectral efficiency, robustness to channel fading, and immunity to impulse interference. However, it has a main drawback, which is the Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). Selecting Mapping (SLM) and Partial Transmit Sequences (PTS) are the two essential techniques for reducing the PAPR; however, they need to send side information to indicate how the transmitter generates signals. In this paper, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based dummy sub-carriers are inserted with the data to reduce PAPR without transmitting side information. The incorporation of PSO-based Dummy Sub-carriers Insertion (DSI) method on this system is performed by measuring the PAPR at the IFFT output (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) after adding 6 adaptive sub-carrier sequences to the input data of IFFT. The PSO-based dummy algorithm decides to send the data once the PAPR of this data sequence and dummy sub-carrier is under a specific threshold. Using MATLAB as a mathematical simulation tool, simulation results are presented for a standard OFDM network model. The network model has been simulated in an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel environment to investigate PAPR and Bit-Error Rate (BER) performance. The simulation results show that the dummy sequence based on PSO reduces PAPR down to 4 dB compared to a conventional OFDM system and down to 3 dB compared with the clipping technique for the same BER performance."

On the basis of genius and beauty novels, Chen Lang broke through its creative mode of simply depicting love between men and women. By adding other elements such as wars and heroes, he realized the innovation of creative mode, and at the same time achieved the purpose of showing his personal talents and ideals. Under the atmosphere of improved acceptance of novels in the late Joseon dynasty, Sim Nung-Sook also used the method of combining original works, depicting the love between men and women and the story of meritorious deeds in the works, and at the same time made personal desires replaced and satisfied.In the part of creative mode, both Xueyuemei and Oksugi completed the creation of works through the structure of “family debut, family unity and joint contribution”. The difference is that Oksugi adds the marriage between the Wang family and the Ren family, the connection between Jia Youxian and Lvye, and the conflicts between the wives and concubines caused by Mrs. Sheng in the last part of the work. In the content part, the two works are based on a large number of original novels, through combination, transformation and other methods to complete the creation of the “love + hero” model. It’s just that unlike Xueyuemei which all borrowed from Chinese works, Oksugi used Chinese and Korean classical novels while shaping the image of love and heroes, and finally made the works show a more complex fusion characteristic.In the part of writer’s consciousness, both Chen Lang and Sim Nung-Sook achieved the purpose of showing their talents and the substitute and satisfaction of life’s desires through the creation of novels. At the same time, Chen Lang, as a figure who has not obtained a formal official position, expressed the hope that the country should select talents based on talent rather than a single imperial examination by depicting the process of protagonists of various identities making contributions through recommendation and other methods. As a descendant of scholar-officials, Sim Nung-Sook projected his own family into the works, and realized his desire for life through the process of marriage between various scholar-officials, fighting against enemies together, and sharing prosperity and wealth."
Reduced-Reference 3D Image Quality Measurement via Spatial to Gradient Domain Feature Aggregation,2022,"['3D image quality', 'Generalized Gaussian density (GGD)', 'Enhanced gradient magnitudes', 'Phase congruency (PC) and Human visual']",,"Objective quality measurement of a three-dimensional (3D) image is a challenging issue in various 3D visual applications since it is infl uenced by multiple aspects such as binocular fusion, binocular rivalry and visual comfort, etc. Existing studies show that classic 2D and some 3D image quality measurement (IQM) are only perform well for symmetric distorted 3D images, but not able to evaluate the quality of asymmetrical distorted 3D images accurately. In this paper, based on the statistical characteristics of natural images and perceptual properties of human visual system (HVS), we propose a novel reduced-reference (RR) 3D quality assessment evaluator (R3DQAE) to deal with the characteristics of 3D images. Two key technical steps are involved in R3DQAE: the statistical characteristics of 3D images and the perceptual properties of HVS.Specifi cally, in spatial domain, the generalized Gaussian density fi ts of luminance wavelet coeffi cients and correlations of luminance and disparity wavelet coeffi cients are used to represent the statistical characteristics of 3D image. Furthermore, in gradient domain, the enhanced gradient magnitudes are computed by using neighborhood phase congruency information to weight the gradient magnitudes in a locally adaptive manner. Afterward, the entropy diff erencing of discrete wavelet transform coeffi cients of enhanced gradient magnitudes are extracted as the perceptual features of HVS. Finally, the qualities index of both the statistical characteristics of 3D image and the perceptual properties of HVS are combined to yield 3D image quality index. Experiments are performed on published 3D image quality assessment database show that the proposed model achieves highly competitive performance as compared with the state-of-the art some typical full-reference and RR 3DIQM models."

For the churches to activate ""like a church"" during this time, restoring the essence of the Gospel is necessary. When the Western societies and churches struggled in the 1960s and 70s amid the strong winds of secularization and humanization, evangelical leaders, led by Billy Graham and John Stott, reaffirmed their concerns about the Gospel, missionary work, and social participation through the Lausanne Congress '74. Evangelical leaders of the Korean churches also participated in this conference and encouraged them to initiate the Korean church missionary movement. However, the Lausanne movement and the Lausanne document became more influential on international missionary church entities than on Korean churches.Pastor Yong-jo Ha (1946-2011) planted Onnuri Church in 1985 with the vision of an ""ACTS-like church"" and greatly contributed to the Korean evangelical missionary movement. As a boy, his family received support from missionaries of the American Presbyterian Church in Mokpo due to the 1.4 retreat during the Korean War. Their help and influence impacted his later life. In his youth, he served as a staff at the CCC for seven years under the guidance of Pastor Joon-gon Kim. During his time at the Presbyterian Theological University, he got influenced by Pastor Kyung-jik Han and Fuller Theological Seminary professors, Arthur F. Glasser and C. Peter Wagner, which later encouraged him and his student colleagues to devote themselves to the prayer movement and the establishment of the Missionary Dispatch Research Association.From 1981-84 Yong-jo Ha studied in England, where he received missionary training as a candidate at the WEC International Mission agency, and studied under John Stott at the London Institue, he was inspired through a year of learning and his connection with John. Later, Pastor Yong-jo Ha confessed that his evangelical missionary theology got formed during this period and that he painted a picture of the convergence mission of the churches and missionary groups.Although Pastor Yong-jo Ha did not have a chance to attend the 1st to 3rd Lausanne Congress, however he naturally embraced the mission spirit of the Lausanne Movement through mission mentors, and the Lausanne theology got embodied through various missionary groups, including the Onnuri Church he founded and pioneered. Pastor Yong-jo Ha and Onnuri Church, influenced by the missional theology of Lausanne, are the rare forms of Korean missionary church among the traditional Korean churches where they implemented various ministries seeking evangelical missionary work, social participation, and cultural transformation. In other words, they participated in the Duranno Book, Tyrannus International Mission(TIM), CGNTV, Handong University, Onnuri Welfare Foundation, Onnuri M Center, Love Sonata, and 10/40Window unreached people adoption movement(AAP). Via this diverse and wide range of domestic and foreign missionaries and social participatory ministries, Onnuri Church contributed to the realization of Korean society and missionary sites in more practical forms than the Lausanne spirit staying in Lausanne documents. In conclusion, Pastor Yong-jo Ha pursued a missionary church and missionary ministry, which was different from the traditional church model of denomination-centeredism. Many Korean Christians evaluate the Onnuri Church as a unique form of church that is different from the traditional church and missionary work, open to missionary work, social participation, and modern culture.Since the establishment of the Korean Lausanne Committee in 1989, the efforts of the Korean Lausanne Committee, the Lausanne theology spread to Korean churches, seminaries, and missionary groups, and the dedication of Pastor Jae-hoon Lee, who is now in charge of Onnuri Church, greatly contributed to hosting the 4th Lausanne Congress Seoul in 2024.

The world of market power, which is showing its overall appearance, exerts the power to neutralize not only the economic realm but also the value system of beliefs that mediate design, art, and culture. In this study, design epistemology is approached from a sociological perspective. In particular, this study aims to explore topics related to the tendency of reification that dominates the modern social order from the perspective of design epistemology. First, it explores the intersecting areas of design and sociology and expands them to the areas of design epistemology. Second, it determines how to include sociological themes in the epistemological interpretation of design and how to establish a methodological system for this. This study intends to reveal the sociological context for changing the design paradigm by understanding the qualitative aspects of the reification phenomenon. (Method) In Chapter 1, it is determined that the phenomenon of “marketization of the world” triggered by neoliberalism and the expansion of market power is affecting the overall art design culture, especially the belief system in design perception, and the background is examined. In Chapter 2, the social properties of design and previous studies that can be the basis for contextualized design discourse are analyzed. In Chapter 3, the scope of the research contents is determined using the analyzed data. In Chapter 4, the items extracted through analysis are revealed, and cross-analysis is conducted to establish the possibility of becoming design epistemology. Chapter 5 interprets the relationship between newly constructed and socialized entities, that is, design, humans, and the global environment, using the newly constructed design epistemology based on the sociological system of reification. (Results) First, the incorporation of a design into the sociological domain and its interpretation as a convergent discussion must occur through cultural transformation. Second, critical thinking is required such that the act of designing and producing objects is becoming “reification.” This is because things have the property of functioning only as capital without prioritizing the human value system. Third, to overcome the reification phenomenon of design products promoted by the industrialization phenomenon of design, restoration of the value of the use of objects is required. (Conclusions) First, in order to construct reification as a theoretical model of design epistemology, it is necessary to not only criticize the reification phenomenon itself but also concentrate on it as the “problem of attitude” of each subject. Second, it should start with renewing an understanding of the materiality of the design being reification. Third, for a design to be built into a sociological system, sociological themes must become a research methodology."

However, the reconstructed images obtained by the sparse-view CT imaging technique suffer from severe artifacts, resulting in the distortion of image quality and internal structures. In this study, we proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) with wavelet transformation and residual learning for reducing artifacts in sparse-view CT image, and the performance of the trained model was quantitatively analyzed. The CNN consisted of wavelet transformation, convolutional and inverse wavelet transformation layers, and input and output images were configured as sparse-view CT images and residual images, respectively. For training the CNN, the loss function was calculated by using mean squared error (MSE), and the Adam function was used as an optimizer. Result images were obtained by subtracting the residual images, which were predicted by the trained model, from sparse-view CT images. The quantitative accuracy of the result images were measured in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM). The results showed that the trained model is able to improve the spatial resolution of the result images as well as reduce artifacts in sparse-view CT images effectively. Also, the trained model increased the PSNR and SSIM by 8.18% and 19.71% in comparison to the imaging model trained without wavelet transformation and residual learning, respectively. Therefore, the imaging model proposed in this study can restore the image quality of sparse-view CT image by reducing artifacts, improving spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy."

To address this problem, gradient subnetwork and gradient-based loss model are incorporated into the generator to alleviate the image structure distortion, however textural distortions still remain a pending issue. Therefore, this paper proposes the SR deep learning model based on the sparse gradient-guided attention and wavelet loss that corrects the texture distortions for better SR image restoration. In particularly, a sparse gradient-guided self-attention to model global interdependency between features is designed, thereby increasing the power of structural reconstruction.

Such a model is not useful for determining the check-up time necessary to achieve the system reliability target. In this paper, we present a system reliability model in terms of the engine check-up time and mission time. We use the cumulative exposure model to relate the lifetime of an engine operating at different thrust values, assuming that the lifetime of each engine follows a general distribution. By using a mixed exponential distribution, we obtain a closed form expression of system reliability and explain how time-independent engine reliability can be transformed to time-dependent engine reliability.Result: The proposed model is useful for determining the check-up time that provides the target mission reliability.Conclusion: The reliability of a liquid rocket propulsion system must be expressed explicitly in terms of the engine reliability depending on the check-up time and the mission time if the check-up time must be determined to achieve the system reliability requirement."

Asymmetric velocity and pressure fields are formed in model B, while a symmetric flow field is formed in model A. The asymmetric flow field is caused by backflow near the plug which is cut in model B. An analysis of noise is performed through fast Fourier transform of noise sources. As a result, noise sources in the outlet cavity and throttle in model B are found not significantly influenced, while noise sources are found to be dramatically increased near the wall of the seat and the right part of the plug.

Recently, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning technique using FFT as a preprocessing process has been proposed to improve the performance of received signal classification in signal interference or noise environments. However, due to the characteristics of the FFT in which the window is fixed, it is not possible to accurately classify the change over time of the detection signal. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a CNN model that has high resolution in the time domain and frequency domain and uses wavelet transform as a preprocessing process that can express various types of signals simultaneously in time and frequency domains. It has been demonstrated that the proposed wavelet transform method through simulation shows superior performance regardless of the SNR change in terms of accuracy and learning speed compared to the FFT transform method, and shows a greater difference, especially when the SNR is low."

However, RGB images in dark illumination environments or environments where target objects are occluded other objects cause poor object recognition performance. On the other hand, IR images provide strong object recognition performance in these environments because it detects infrared waves rather than visible illumination. In this paper, we propose an RGB-IR fusion model, high-frequency interchange network (HINet), which improves object recognition performance by combining only the strengths of RGB-IR image pairs. HINet connected two object detection models using a mutual high-frequency transfer (MHT) to interchange advantages between RGB-IR images. MHT converts each pair of RGB-IR images into a discrete cosine transform (DCT) spectrum domain to extract high-frequency information. The extracted high-frequency information is transmitted to each other's networks and utilized to improve object recognition performance.

A Boundary Integral Equation Formulation for an Unsteady Anisotropic-Diffusion Convection Equation of Exponentially Variable Coefficients and Compressible Flow,2022,"['variable coefficients', 'anisotropic functionally graded materials', 'unsteady diffusion convection equation', 'Laplace transform', 'boundary element method. This work was supported by Universitas Hasanuddin and Kementerian Pendidikan', 'Kebu dayaan', 'Riset', 'dan Teknologi Indonesia']",,The anisotropic-diffusion convection equation with exponentially variable co efficients is discussed in this paper. Numerical solutions are found using a combined Laplace transform and boundary element method. The variable coefficients equation is usually used to model problems of functionally graded media. First the variable coeffi cients equation is transformed to a constant coefficients equation. The constant coefficients equation is then Laplace-transformed so that the time variable vanishes. The Laplace transformed equation is consequently written as a boundary integral equation which in volves a time-free fundamental solution. The boundary integral equation is therefore employed to find numerical solutions using a standard boundary element method. Finally the results obtained are inversely transformed numerically using the Stehfest formula to get solutions in the time variable. The combined Laplace transform and boundary element method are easy to implement and accurate for solving unsteady problems of anisotropic exponentially graded media governed by the diffusion convection equation.

As a theoretical model, a monocentric general equilibrium model was mathematically constructed and simulated on two different scenarios: with and without greenbelt. In the case of empirical analysis, we statistically test the effects of the greenbelt on the population and employment density gradients by building a polycentric density gradient function with an actual data. The analysis results are summarized as follows. First, Seoul’s greenbelt contributed to 1) increasing land and housing prices and development density in non-greenbelt areas, and 2) the extension of the city boundary by about 3km, resulting in a longer commuting distance for the workers residing outside greenbelt. Second, the empirical model results showed that the population and employment densities of greenbelt regions were lower by 100% and 133%, respectively, than those of non-greenbelt regions due to green belt regulations, confirming that the greenbelt contributed to successfully deterring development. If the green belt is lifted and 40% of the green belt is converted to urban use, about 1.6 million people and 0.82 million jobs would be located within the green belt area, which are equivalent to 6.5% of the total population and 7.3% of all jobs in the Seoul metropolitan area."

DG-based SPO tuple recognition using self-attention M-Bi-LSTM,2022,"['dependency grammar', 'information extraction', 'long short-term memory', 'SPO tuple']",,"This study proposes a dependency grammar-based self-attention multilayered bidirectional long short-term memory (DG-M-Bi-LSTM) model for subject–predicate–object (SPO) tuple recognition from natural language (NL) sentences. To add recent knowledge to the knowledge base autonomously, it is essential to extract knowledge from numerous NL data. Therefore, this study proposes a high-accuracy SPO tuple recognition model that requires a small amount of learning data to extract knowledge from NL sentences. The accuracy of SPO tuple recognition using DG-M-Bi-LSTM is compared with that using NL-based self-attention multilayered bidirectional LSTM, DG-based bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), and NL-based BERT to evaluate its effectiveness. The DG-M-Bi-LSTM model achieves the best results in terms of recognition accuracy for extracting SPO tuples from NL sentences even if it has fewer deep neural network (DNN) parameters than BERT. In particular, its accuracy is better than that of BERT when the learning data are limited. Additionally, its pretrained DNN parameters can be applied to other domains because it learns the structural relations in NL sentences."
Particle generation to minimize the computing time of the discrete element method for particle packing simulation,2022,"['Discrete element method', 'Growing particle', 'Particle generation', 'Powder packing']",,"There are computation time constraints caused by the number and size of particles in the powder packing simulation using DEM. In this paper, newly suggested packing model transforms a general packing sequence –particle generation, stack, and compressioninto particle generation and packing by growing particles. To verify the new packing model, it was compared using three contact models widely used in DEM, in terms of radial distribution function, porosity, and coordination number. As a result, contact between particles showed a similar trend, and the pore distribution was also similar. Using the new packing model can reduce simulation time by 400 % compared to the normal packing model without any other coarse graining methods.

Schüssler Fiorenza’s hermeneutics developed in three stages. The first step was a mutually linear hermeneutical model of suspicion, proclamation, remembrance, and creative actualization, which takes the women-church as a hermeneutical horizon. The middle stage was the hermeneutical model of suspicion, remembrance, evaluation and proclamation, as well as liberative vision and imagination. This stage had many of the same elements as the first stage but reinforced the consciousness-raising and the systematic analysis of patriarchy in the social, political, cultural and religious dimensions. It took the ekklesia of wo/men as a hermeneutical horizon. Finally, the latter stage, had more elements than the first two. These included the hermeneutical model of experience, domination and social location, suspicion, critical evaluation, creative imagination, re?membering and reconstruction, and transformative action for change. The final stage, interacting in a complex and intersecting way, developed as if it were actively dancing. Schüssler Fiorenza named this hermeneutical model “Wisdom Dance.” Each of these steps has an episte-practical ground common to feminist critique. But over the feminist second wave to third, their differences moved from the emphasis on community to the embracement of diversity, from the critique of patriarchy to the critique of kyriarchy and from the mutual linear process of hermeneutics to the intersectional and complex process. The hermeneutical horizon of Schüssler Fiorenza’s in the first step was the women-church and in the second and third stages it was the ekklesia of wo/men. While the women church strongly colored by her idea of the earlychurch of New Testament times and emphasized communality, the ekklesia of wo/men paid attention to the democratic coexistence of other voices and practices on a global level. Furthermore, moving from the critique of patriarchy to kyriarchy differentiates the ekklesia of wo/men of the third from the second stage. This distinction changed the width and depth of the critique and the affirmation of diversity. These differences influenced the results of Schüssler Fiorenza’s hermeneutics in each stage."

EMRWG급전을 위한 제안된 구조는 입력 및 출력 끝에서 도파관과 동일한 너비와 높이를 갖는 단일 리지 직사각형 도파관을 사용하였다. 삽입된 포스트 커패시터는 EMRWG의 넓은 벽체 하부 중앙에 형성된 원형 홈과 상부에 삽입된 동심원기둥 포스트로 구성된다. 먼저 제안된 구조에 대한 등가회로 모델을 제시하였고, EMRWG와 단일 리지 도파관이 결합될 때 이상적인 변압기의 접합 서셉턴스와 권선비는 각각 HFSS(3d fullwave 시뮬레이터, Ansoft Co.)를 사용하여 두 가지 경우에 대해 시뮬레이션하였다. 얻어진 매개변수와 EMRWG의 특성을 이용하여 삽입된 기둥의 서셉턴스 및 공진 특성을 분석하였다. 중심주파수 4.5GHz, 대역폭 170MHz의 2포스트 필터는 WR-90 도파관을 이용하여 설계하였으며, 등가회로 모델에 대한 계산과 HFSS와 CST를 이용한 시뮬레이션 결과가 서로 일치하였다.","In this paper, a novel small-diameter cylindrical post capacitor inserted into an evanescent-mode rectangular waveguide (EMRWG) is proposed for easier tuning. In order to feed the EMRWG, the proposed structure uses a single ridge rectangular waveguide with the same width and height as the waveguide at the input and output ends. The inserted post capacitor are made up a circular groove formed in the center of the lower part of the broad wall of the EMRWG, and a concentric cylindrical post inserted into the upper part. First, the equivalent circuit model for the proposed structure is presented. When the EMRWG and the single ridge waveguide are combined, the joint susceptance and the turns ratio of the ideal transformer are calculated by two simulations using HFSS (3d fullwave simulator, Ansoft Co.) respectively. The susceptance and resonance characteristics of the inserted post were analyzed by using the obtained parameters and the characteristics of the EMRWG. A 2-post filter with a center frequency of 4.5 GHz and a bandwidth of 170 MHz was designed using a WR-90 waveguide, and the simulation results by using the HFSS and CST, equivalent circuit model were in good agreement."
Setpoint Decision Support Strategy and Adaptive Hybrid Control of Greenhouse Climate: A Simulation Study,2022,"['Adaptive hybrid control', 'greenhouse climate', 'greenhouse climate control', 'receding horizon multiobjective optimization', 'setpoint decision support strategy.']",,"The energy saving performance of the greenhouse production is significantly impacted by the setpoint of the greenhouse climate and the control method. How to select a good setpoint for the greenhouse climate is an important issue. To solve this issue, this work proposes a decision support strategy to generate online the setpoint for the control of the greenhouse climate. In this approach, it uses online receding horizon multi-objective optimization to maximize the crop yield and minimize the energy consumption. Thus, it can obtain the optimal daily mean temperature of each day. Since such method does not directly optimize the sepoint of the greenhouse climate, it must introduce the daily mean temperature serialization method to transform the daily mean temperature into the setpoint curve. Once the sepoint is generated, the next task is to solve the control problem of the greenhouse climate. Since the greenhouse climate is a complex nonlinear system, and is impacted by the greenhouse structure and material, the weather and the crop growth. Therefore, it is usually difficult to accurately model the greenhouse climate. The great uncertainty of the system makes the control problem of the greenhouse climate be difficult to solve. To solve this problem, this work proposes an adaptive hybrid control based on a greenhouse climate model with unknown timevariant parameters. In this control method, neural network is used to estimate the model parameters. Based on such a model, an adaptive control law is derived to generate the control inputs of the heating, fogging and CO2 injecting, while the control strategies of the ventilation, shading and thermal screen are determined by the expert rules. The simulation results indicate that such adaptive hybrid control method can achieve good control performance and economic efficiency."
Statistical tolerance–cost–service life optimization of blade bearing of controllable pitch propeller considering the marine environment conditions through meta-heuristic algorithm,2022,"['marine environment effects in propellers', 'controllable pitch propeller', 'statistical tolerance–cost–service life optimization', 'meta-heuristic algorithm']",,"Blade bearing is the key mechanism of the controllable pitch propellers (CPPs) to adjust the pitch to change the thrust. In the marine environment, wear and deformation of the contact surface of the blade bearing are quite large, which may result in leakage to reduce the service life of CPP. However, most studies on tolerance optimization of blade bearing disregard deformations and wear, and it could result in unreasonable tolerances and impair the CPP’s service life. In this paper, to establish the statistical tolerance–cost–service life optimization model of the blade bearing of the CPP considering the marine environment effects in propellers, a prediction model about the relationship between the thrust and rotation speed of the CPP considering environment conditions of wind, wave, and ocean currents is constructed. Based on this, the wear and deformation are simulated according to the predicted rotation speed in the marine environment. Considering the deformation and wear in the marine environment, a tolerance analysis model of the assembly deviations of the blade bearing is introduced, and the assembly characteristics and functional requirements are established and converted into probability constraints to establish the service-life model based on statistical tolerance analysis and Monte Carlo simulation methods. Afterward, a statistical tolerance–cost–service life optimization model is established and transformed into a single-objective optimization problem through the normalization method and the weighted sum method, and solved by a meta-heuristic algorithm named cuckoo search. Finally, the application of the proposed model is demonstrated through a case involving the blade bearing of a CPP, and the optimized results show that the manufacturing cost of the blade bearing is reduced and its service life is extended."
The TL1A-DR3 Axis in Asthma: Membrane-Bound and Secreted TL1A Co-Determined the Development of Airway Remodeling,2022,"['Asthma', 'airway remodeling', 'airway inflammation', 'tumor necrosis factor', 'TL1A', 'therapeutic target']",,"Purpose: Tumor necrosis factor-like ligand 1A (TL1A), especially its secreted form, has been shown to contribute to eosinophilic inflammation and mucus production, cardinal features of asthma, through its receptor, death receptor 3 (DR3). However, the role of the TL1A-DR3 axis in asthma, especially in terms of airway remodeling, has not yet been fully understood.Methods: The present study investigated the expression and secretion of TL1A in the lung and human bronchial epithelial cells. DR3 small interfering RNA (siRNA), TL1A siRNA, and truncated plasmids were used respectively to identify the function of the TL1A-DR3 axis in vitro. To further validate the roles of the TL1A-DR3 axis in asthma, we collected airway biopsies and sputa from asthmatic patients and constructed a mouse model following rTL1A administration, DR3 knockdown, and TL1A knockout, the asthma-related inflammatory response and the pathological changes in airways were analyzed using various experimental methods. Associated signaling pathways downstream of TL1A knockout in the mouse model were analyzed using RNA sequencing.Results: TL1A, especially its non-secreted form (nsTL1A) was involved in the remodeling process in asthmatics’ airways. Knockdown of TL1A or its receptor DR3 decreased the expression of fibrosis-associated protein in BEAS-2B cells. Reversely, overexpression of nsTL1A in airway epithelial cells facilitated the transforming growth factor-β-induced remodeling progress. In the asthma mouse model, activating the TL1A-DR3 axis contributes to airway inflammation, remodeling, and tissue destruction. Reciprocally, DR3 knockdown or TL1A knockout partly reverses airway remodeling in the asthma model induced by ovalbumin.Conclusions: Our results confirm differential TL1A expression (including its secreted and non-secreted form) in asthma, which modulates remodeling. The shared mechanism of action by which nsTL1A and secreted TL1A exert their effects on asthma development might be mediated via the nuclear factor-κB pathway. The TL1A-DR3 axis presents a promising therapeutic target in asthma."

Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy for the detection of cow’s milk in buffalo milk,2022,"['Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)', 'Adulteration', 'Buffalo milk']",,"In Italy, buffalo mozzarella is a largely sold and consumed dairy product. The fraudulent adulteration of buffalo milk with cheaper and more available milk of other species is very frequent. In the present study, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), in combination with multivariate analysis by partial least square (PLS) regression, was applied to quantitatively detect the adulteration of buffalo milk with cow milk by using a fully automatic equipment dedicated to the routine analysis of the milk composition. To enhance the heterogeneity, cow and buffalo bulk milk was collected for a period of over three years from different dairy farms. A total of 119 samples were used for the analysis to generate 17 different concentrations of buffalo- cow milk mixtures.

We established a relationship of personal and social acceptance with factors derived from a literature review, and designed research models and hypotheses combining DT resistance attitudes. Then, financial practitioners were asked about their perception of DT, and data analysis was conducted with factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. This study finds out that accetance factor for DOI, organizational and behavioral factors, which are determinants derived from previous studies, do not affect DT acceptance resistance and DT acceptance resistance does not negatively affect personal and social acceptability. However, DT acceptance resistance had a mediating effect in the relationship between accetance factors for DOI/organizational and environmental factors and personal acceptability. In addition, it was confirmed that there may be other influences due to partial mediating on social acceptability. The purpose of this study is to study the influence of factors influencing the acceptance resistance of DT and to empirically confirm this by conducting a survey on the practitioners of companies implementing DT. Future research, it needs to explain the diffusion of innovation and additional determinants of DT acceptance resistance and the other industry."

In particular, the effect of changes in the relationship between teachers and students and companions due to changes in Chinese Korean-Chinese school education during the COVID-19 period on deviant behavior is examined.The previous studies emphasize the importance of family love abroad as an influence on the deviant behavior of Chinese Korean-Chinese adolescents. However, these overlooked the importance of the influence of the relationship between teachers and students and companions, which is another important factor in school education.Under the COVID-19 crisis, the incidence of deviant behavior among Korean-Chinese youths in the three northeastern provinces of China has been lower than before. This supplemented the mental health of adolescents by holding a psychological counseling room at school to prevent mental health and deviant behavior of adolescents and cooperating with community service groups. On the other hand, it can be seen that before and after the outbreak of COVID-19, the types of deviant behavior of Korean-Chinese youths in northeastern China have changed, shifting from collective deviant behavior to personal deviant behavior.From a theoretical point of view, it is judged that the omnipotent model, which shows the positive effect of the leader, is suitable for explaining the deviant behavior of the Chinese Korean-Chinese. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the strain theory, which refers to maladjustment to the new educational environment due to changes in the internal and external educational environment, is considered more explanatory."

However, such dependence creates development challenges for her. Simulated impact of prioritized economic reform policies—using a computable general equilibrium model (AZEORANI)—shows that, under the business-as-usual case with oil prices at 2011 level, it is projected to grow by 2.0% a year to 2030. However, consistent policy reforms enable enhanced growth by another 1.1 percentage points annually due to productivity boost and increased exports from non-oil sectors, viz., tourism and agriculture. In particular, following strategic roadmap, we consider baseline and policy shocks—10% improvement in productive efficiency, investment boost by 5% in non-mineral sector, and enhanced agricultural efficiency by 5%, and boost in tourism and transport by 10% via logistics-infrastructure, and technical progress in manufacturing over long run by 10–20% per annum. All these show that economic reforms have potentials to induce positive impact to overcome the binding constraints inhibiting growth and hence could promote economic development of Azerbaijan."

Perceived Risk of Re-Identification in OMOP-CDM Database: A Cross-Sectional Survey,2022,"['Common Data Model', 'De-identification', 'Privacy']",,"Background: The advancement of information technology has immensely increased the quality and volume of health data. This has led to an increase in observational study, as well as to the threat of privacy invasion. Recently, a distributed research network based on the common data model (CDM) has emerged, enabling collaborative international medical research without sharing patient-level data. Although the CDM database for each institution is built inside a firewall, the risk of re-identification requires management. Hence, this study aims to elucidate the perceptions CDM users have towards CDM and risk management for re-identification.Methods: The survey, targeted to answer specific in-depth questions on CDM, was conducted from October to November 2020. We targeted well-experienced researchers who actively use CDM. Basic statistics (total number and percent) were computed for all covariates.Results: There were 33 valid respondents. Of these, 43.8% suggested additional anonymization was unnecessary beyond, “minimum cell count” policy, which obscures a cell with a value lower than certain number (usually 5) in shared results to minimize the liability of re-identification due to rare conditions. During extract-transform-load processes, 81.8% of respondents assumed structured data is under control from the risk of re-identification.However, respondents noted that date of birth and death were highly re-identifiable information. The majority of respondents (n = 22, 66.7%) conceded the possibility of identifier-contained unstructured data in the NOTE table.Conclusion: Overall, CDM users generally attributed high reliability for privacy protection to the intrinsic nature of CDM. There was little demand for additional de-identification methods.However, unstructured data in the CDM were suspected to have risks. The necessity for a coordinating consortium to define and manage the re-identification risk of CDM was urged."

Furthermore, this study investigates the conditions that limit effectiveness of two leadership styles positing power distance orientation and time-with-leader as moderating variables. In particular, although the time-with-leader is not widely known as a critical variable in leadership research, it needs to be discussed in leadership studies considering the reality of less face-to-face contact with leaders due to the telecommuting (eg. working at home). Based on the responses of 224 office workers in China, this study revealed that authoritarian and transformational leadership are positively related to in-role performance. Also, both power distance orientation and time-with-leader have significant positive moderating effects on the relationship between authoritarian leadership and in-role performance. On the contrary, in the case of transformational leadership, both moderating effects have been rejected. This study has a significance in that there are few studies comparing authoritarian and transformational leadership despite advances in leadership research. In addition, it also has a significance in introducing a variable, time-with-leader, which has not been considered as a major variable in leadership research."

This method yields location and amplitude of the change-points with refinement via concentration kernels. We prove that, in an appropriate asymptotic framework, this method provides consistent estimators of change-points with an almost optimal rate. In a simulation study the proposed change-point estimators are compared and discussed. Applications of the proposed methods are provided with Nile flow data and daily won-dollar exchange rate data."

This story emphasizes Wangsaengge (Song for Rebirth in Paradise), Amitabha Buddha, Geungnakwangsaeng (Rebirth in Paradise), and Wonwangsaeng (Praying for Rebirth in Paradise) in the narrative structure of Yigongbonpuri, so it can be said to be a type of Buddhist scripture developed to preach about the Amitabha faith, Geungnakwangsaeng, and Wangsaengge, or a Sakyamuni's jakata. The origin of the story of Jirimsa Temple has been unknown, but in fact, the birthplace can be said to be the mythical shamanistic Yigongbonpuri. Wolin Seokbo was published in 1459 (the fifth year of King Sejo's reign), and the contents of “Anrakguktaejagyeong,” published here, are similar to the story of the Jirimsa Temple, so it can be said that the story of the Jirimsa Temple was inherited from the earlier work. However, “Anrakguktaejagyeong” is annotated in Korean, while the story of the Jirimsa Temple was written in Chinese characters. Since “Anrakguktaejagyeong” is annotated in Korean, it is possible that it contributed greatly to the birth of Korean novels such as the Anrakgukjeon. In fact, the novel Anrakguk used the writer's imagination and creativity to properly add Confucian and Taoist content, including angjamot motifs and life flower motifs, which save people with flowers, making the contents very colorful. However, the content is modeled on the previous Anrakguktaejagyeong, so the characters are the same, and the incorporated Buddhist color remains strong.Among the works affiliated with the Yigongbonpuri narrative, the story of the Jirimsa Temple had the strongest influence on Korean national culture. This is because it created the Anrakguktaejagyeong of Wolinseokbo and the novel Anrakgukjeon, but furthermore, it served as the basis for producing discord such as the land preach “Anrakguktaejagyeongbyeonsangdo” painting and Sarasutang (Buddhist painting). The content of the novel Anrakgukjeon can be evaluated as coming from Anrakguktaejagyeong as its source, but if you go further back to its origin, you will find the story of the Jirimsa Temple. However, if the narrative structure is emphasized, the origin is the shamanistic myth “Yigongbonpuri.” The existing theory of this myth’s journey, that it was formed by the story of the Anrakguktaejagyeong of Wolin Seokbo, or by the novel Anrakgukjeon, needs to be revised because it is not logical."

In the market-centered post-Bretton Woods monetary order, one could expect a reinforcement of the capital compared to the state, but the role of the American state has paradoxically been strengthened. Furthermore, the birth of euro has also demonstrated a renewed transnational state function. The global financial order has been dramatically transformed with the financialization of capitalism and the capitalist orientation of the state. The state has been active in the public debt increase, and the growth of institutional investors and sovereign funds, symbolizing a certain functional fusion between state and capital. The state has been instrumental in transforming the citizens into active participants to the global capitalist order. The rise of the Chinese model of state capitalism as well as the anti-globalization movements in the developed world have been serious challenges to these trends. They nevertheless are different from the Communist challenge of the past in the sense that they no longer propose a replacement of global capitalism but rather a limited correction."

Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world that could exist through international aid in the 1950s and 1960s. Nevertheless, Korea is the only country worldwide that has completely transformed its reputation by joining the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) under the OECD in 2010. The study attempted to discover the factors that enabled only S. Korea to transform its position in the world by exploring 1970s Saemaul Undong from the perspective of the early community development formalized in the 1940s and started to be systematically conceptualized in the middle of the 1950s.The findings could be summarized as follows; 1) local autonomy guaranteed in the community development process, 2) the central government's incentives through inter-individual and inter-regional competition to motivate individuals and the entire village, and 3) the central government's management of national support resources, 4) the government's performing supplementary role according to the needs of the community development process nationwide, and 5) educating community leaders. It is meaningful from a practical perspective in the community development initiatives related to ODA, which have been promoted in various parts of the world to eradicate poverty and improve the living environment."
Why does organizational culture matter for public employees’ innovative behavior?,2022,"['Innovative behaviors', 'innovative culture', 'transformational leadership']",,"The current research addressed two main research questions: (1) What antecedents in an organizational context are related to public employees’ innovative behaviors? (2) Does an innovative culture have moderating effects on the relationship between antecedents and innovative behaviors? Using a nationwide sample of South Korea government employees, the research explored the effects of expected antecedents on innovative behaviors using a randomcoefficient model, which takes into account the variance of slopes and intercepts in a nested data structure. Results indicated, first, that job autonomy, goal clarity, cooperative communication, transformational leadership, and an innovative culture are positively associated with public employees’ innovative behaviors. Second, an innovative culture shows moderating effects only on goal clarity and transformational leadership."

What Can BERT Do for English Linguistics?: A Case Study of Examining It-cleft Constructions,2022,"['deep-learning', 'language model', 'it-cleft', 'pronominal case', 'platform']",,"This study used the machine learning technique known as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to understand the pronominal distribution in it-cleft constructions. While language models (LMs) have successfully been used to examine and verify linguistic representations, most studies have focused on the general phenomenon of subject-verb agreement. As such, this study focused on the particular construction known as it-cleft, in order to consolidate the LM’s role as a linguistic platform. In the experiment using BERT, the surprisal of each case (i.e., nominative and accusative) is compared. The investigation successfully replicated the findings of previous studies, specifically by capturing the use of the accusative form, inhibition of the first-person pronominal, and collocate feature of the first-person pronominal with the complementizer who.The results from the LM also deliver further contribution to the study of it-cleft, involving the between number and the relationship between the pronominal and syntactic role. Thus, the usage of BERT both revealed new research questions while verifying evidence from previous studies on the it-cleft pronominal. This demonstrates that BERT can correctly represent particular constructions and broadens the possibilities of LMs as a linguistic platform."

A Joint Design for Multi-band Heterogeneous Networks when Deploying Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface,2022,"['Reconfigure Intelligent Surface', 'practical model', 'muti-band heterogeneous networks', 'convex optimization']",,"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technique is effective to improve the capacity and coverage of various networks. However, the practical RIS has dissimilar responses to signals in different frequencies due to its structure. Therefore, directly applying existing schemes to multi-band heterogeneous networks leads to beam misalignment and performance degra- dation issues. This paper considers RIS-assisted multi-band heterogeneous networks where base stations (BSs) use different frequencies. We formulate the problem for maximizing the sum rate of all users (SR) in every frequency band, and aim to jointly design BSs precoding vectors and RIS parameters while taking user choices into account. Based on the closed-form relationship of phase shifts between frequencies, an iterative algo- rithm is proposed to solve the challenging non-convex problems. In particular, we use fractional programming to decouple the problem, and solve the subproblems with Quadratic Transform (QT) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve SR among all frequency bands, which could instruct the coexistence of mul- tiple communication systems in future heterogeneous networks. What’s more, results also prove that deploying RISs recklessly will result in a degradation of the network."

The novel is a fictional reference to the discourse reported by the newspaper media about the attempted affair between the young novelist Sohei Morita and the new woman Haru Hiratsuka, later widely known as Raicho Hiratsuka. Soseki is modeling the character Mineko, modeled on the image of Haru Hiratsuka, which he heard from Sohei Morita. Of course, there is no one-to-one correspondence between Haru Hiratsuka and Mineko. However, the image of Mineko in the novel reflects the image of Haru Hiratsuka as reported in the newspaper.Mineko, who is portrayed as a new woman, is incorporated into the system of marriage. She owns the family estate divided by her soon-to-be-married brother. However, according to the Civil Code, the right to manage the wife's property belongs to the husband. So, if she gets married, she cannot use her property. Before getting married, Mineko lends San Shiro 30 yen and refuses to get it back. But Sanshiro pays back 30 yen with his mother's money. As described above, Mineko's slight deviation from the system of marriage is eliminated by Sanshiro's debt repayment. And in this scene, Mineko confesses her sins. However, this thesis considered the fact that Mineko's words, spoken in the context of the Bible, only deceive Sanshiro like counterfeit bills, but are not actual confessions of sin."

The intervention of public art in public space not only brings users a sense of space experience, but also becomes a unique carrier of urban and rural image making. Although there is much research on the classification, aesthetics and function of public art, there is few quantitative research on user satisfaction. This paper takes the basic features of airport public art as a research object and the basic features of airport public art as the theoretical basis to study the impact of the basic characteristics of airport public art on user satisfaction. Research methods were based on questionnaire data of 247 people, in which models and hypotheses were tested using SPSS 21.0 software, based on the induction and extraction of nine influential factors in the basic characteristics of public art. The study found that public interpretation, media patterns, color perception, modeling form, place perception, city image and memory have significant positive effects on user satisfaction. The sharedness of public art, cognition and communication in public culture and spatial relations do not affect satisfaction. Conclusion, inspiration and prospect provide suggestions for designers and reference data and theoretical support for public art evaluation."

Part of the challenges associated with the pandemic included instituting new COVID-19 workplace policies (e.g., social distancing, masking) designed to protect employees from spread of the virus. The present study is designed to understand employee perceptions of the risks of discussing their COVID-19 concerns in the workplace and how this is related to perceived organizational support and COVID-19 policy communication.Methods: Two-hundred and fifty-two individuals working during the COVID-19 pandemic completed an online survey administered via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Participants’ COVID-19 policy communication within their organization, their perceptions of organizational support, and their perceived risk associated with discussing COVID-19 concerns in the workplace were analyzed with Pearson correlations and hierarchical regression models using SPSS 27.Results: COVID-19 policy communication was negatively correlated to employees’ levels of perceived organizational support (r = –.148, p = .018). The regression models indicated that COVID-19 policy communication and perceived organizational support explain a significant amount of employees’ perceived risks of discussing COVID-19 concerns in the workplace.Conclusions: Organizations need to be aware of whether employees feel supported by organizational policies and whether they can reveal their concerns about health-related issues and/or organizational crises in their workplace. The implications of the study findings are discussed in terms of the risks of discussing health concerns in the workplace and the nature of work in times of crisis."

In order to reduce the damage of pests, it is important to timely implement pest control according to various types of pests. Existing pest classification is identified by the naked eye of an experienced farmer or expert. This requires considerable time and cost, so an unmanned pest classification technology is needed. In this paper, a new bidirectional multiscale feature fusion method for pest image classification is proposed. In particular, in order to supplement the scale vulnerability of the existing PVT model, the multi-scale features extracted from the PVT backbone are applied bidirectionally by four fusion methods. Through the experimental results, the fusion method with the highest performance is derived and it is shown that the proposed bidirectional multiscale feature fusion method can improve the pest image classification performance."

Safety monitoring system of personal mobility driving using deep learning,2022,"['deep learning', 'personal mobility', 'short-time Fourier transform', 'wavelet transform', 'convolutional neural networks']",,"Although the e-scooter sharing service market is growing as a representative last-mile mobility, the accident rate is increasing proportionally as the number of users increases. This study proposes a deep learning-based personal mobility driver monitoring system that detects inattentive driving by classifying vibration data transmitted to the e-scooter when the driver fails to concentrate on driving. First, the N-back task technique is used. The driver was stimulated by external visual and auditory factors to generate a cognitive load, and vibration data were collected through a six-axis sensor. Second, the generated vibration data were pre-processed using short-time Fourier transform and wavelet transform (WT) and then converted into an image (spectrogram). Third, four multimodal convolutional neural networks such as LeNet-5, VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 were constructed and their performance was compared to find the best architecture. Experimental results show that multimodal DenseNet121 with WT can accurately classify safe, slightly anxious, and very anxious driving conditions. The proposed model can be applied to real-time monitoring and warning systems for sharing service providers and used as a basis for insurance and legal action in the case of accidents."

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a central role in promoting ECM accumulation. We aimed to examine the effects of EW-7197, an inhibitor of TGF-β type 1 receptor kinase (ALK5), in retarding the progression of DN, both in vivo, using a diabetic mouse model (db/db mice), and in vitro, in podocytes and mesangial cells.Methods: In vivo study: 8-week-old db/db mice were orally administered EW-7197 at a dose of 5 or 20 mg/kg/day for 10 weeks.Metabolic parameters and renal function were monitored. Glomerular histomorphology and renal protein expression were evaluated by histochemical staining and Western blot analyses, respectively. In vitro study: DN was induced by high glucose (30 mM) in podocytes and TGF-β (2 ng/mL) in mesangial cells. Cells were treated with EW-7197 (500 nM) for 24 hours and the mechanism associated with the attenuation of DN was investigated.Results: Enhanced albuminuria and glomerular morphohistological changes were observed in db/db compared to that of the nondiabetic (db/m) mice. These alterations were associated with the activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Treatment with EW-7197 significantly inhibited TGF-β signaling, inflammation, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in diabetic mice and renal cells.Conclusion: EW-7197 exhibits renoprotective effect in DN. EW-7197 alleviates renal fibrosis and inflammation in diabetes by inhibiting downstream TGF-β signaling, thereby retarding the progression of DN. Our study supports EW-7197 as a therapeutically beneficial compound to treat DN."

This study started with the question of how art subjects would respond to the social demands for an alternative school system and participate in this change. In this study, the literature analysis was conducted with the following research questions. Where does the re-emphasis on educational innovation, on which the 2022 Revised Curriculum is anchored, derive from? What meaning does personalized education have in the context of art subjects, and how can art learning analysis be conceptualized? Finally, what is the direction of constructing an art learning analysis system? As a result, the developmental, cognitive, and sociocultural perspectives that define the characteristics of learners within the art department were discussed. In addition, the core areas of art learning analysis are proposed as ‘aesthetics’, ‘inquiry’, ‘originality’, ‘aptitude’. These core areas of art learning analysis was derived by analyzing the instructor's feedback on art activities using topic modeling technique and interpreting the semantic structure within each topic. The significance of this study can be found in that it shed light on the educational trend from a a macroscopic point of view, and explored new ways of art education through the concept of art learning analysis."
Does IoT service orchestration in public services enrich the citizens’ perceived value of digital society?,2022,"['Internet of Things', 'public services', 'perceived value', 'digital society affinity', 'smart government']",,"The continuous growth of digital transformation aims to leverage the changes and opportunities for IoT technologies in public sector, which has created an impact on the sustainability of digital societies.

Alliance Coordination: Explaining the Logic of Biden's Taiwan Policy†,2022,"['alliance coordination', 'cross-strait relations', 'Taiwan policy', 'US–China relations']",,"The Biden administration is attempting to transform traditional US–Taiwan relations into a multilateralism-based “US + alliance–Taiwan” interactional model, which can be conceptualized as alliance coordination. This article unpacks the logic of Biden's strategic thinking in the US Taiwan policy. Adopting an asymmetric alliance perspective, it argues that US allies' reactions to Biden's foreign policy and their ideological attitude toward China have interacted with the US placement of the Taiwan question on the agenda in the alliance system to produce different degrees of alliance coordination, which can be measured by the new typology constituted by seven approaches: all-fields approach, pure high politics approach, high politics driven approach, half-measures, low politics driven approach, pure low politics approach, and strategic inaction. Three cases, including the different reactions of Japan, European countries, and South Korea, are analyzed to demonstrate how the alliance coordination operates in realpolitik. Additionally, the assessment of this article reveals that Biden's alliance coordination would place growing strategic pressure on mainland China and introduces greater volatility into cross-strait relations."
Tolerance analysis of a compliant assembly using random Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline curves and isogeometric method,2022,"['random NURBS curve', 'geometric deviation modeling', 'computer-aided tolerance analysis', 'isogeometric method', 'profile tolerance']",,"Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) is one of the most versatile tools of computer-aided design. The concept of random NURBS curves is introduced for modeling the geometrical errors in mechanical parts and assemblies. The proposed idea is utilized to solve an example problem involving deformable components. For this purpose, profile tolerances of the parts are transformed into covariance matrices of NURBS control polygon parameters. Then, the control polygons are used as vector chains to calculate geometrical error propagation. Afterwards, isogeometric analysis (IGA) is invoked to express deformations of the parts during the assembly process as changes in the shape of the underlying control polygons. Finally, the result of the calculations is translated back into the tolerance zone of the assembly. Numerical examples are employed to examine the effect of NURBS structure (degree, knot vector, and control points) on convergence and stability of results. Outcomes of the theory are compared with direct measurements of actual assemblies and results of a Monte Carlo finite element simulation to illustrate the validity of the results. Furthermore, the developed model is used to obtain practical guidelines regarding the reduction of geometrical errors by the optimum design of the assembly."
Deep learning-based scalable and robust channel estimator for wireless cellular networks,2022,"['channel estimation', 'deep learning', 'wireless cellular networks']",,"In this paper, we present a two-stage scalable channel estimator (TSCE), a deep learning (DL)-based scalable, and robust channel estimator for wireless cellular networks, which is made up of two DL networks to efficiently support different resource allocation sizes and reference signal configurations. Both networks use the transformer, one of cutting-edge neural network architecture, as a backbone for accurate estimation. For computation-efficient global feature extractions, we propose using window and window averaging-based self-attentions. Our results show that TSCE learns wireless propagation channels correctly and outperforms both traditional estimators and baseline DL-based estimators. Additionally, scalability and robustness evaluations are performed, revealing that TSCE is more robust in various environments than the baseline DL-based estimators."

In the meanwhile, several ways for correcting cognitive bias have been investigated, but there is a limit to eliciting a change in long-held beliefs by a unilateral delivery mechanism, typically a one-time group education or training session. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to design a web-based application that focuses on cognitive biases that can influence the thought processes and scientific research of scientists by addressing the shortcomings of the existing de-cognitive bias correction approach. To this purpose, cognitive biases that can influence scientific thought and research are divided into categories such as ""identifying ideas"", ""selecting ideas"", ""generating ideas"", ""evaluating ideas"", and ""transforming ideas"", and a self-assessment questionnaire was created. After logging into the website program and completing a survey, participants can receive data that has been designed for they based on the survey findings, monitor their own learning progress with regular notifications, and modify their way of thinking naturally by submitting feedback. For this program, the 'nudge' technique was used. This program's front end was made with Next.js and distributed with vecel, while the back end was created with Firebase.

However, in the case of industrial equipment, various operating conditions occur, and it is difficult to secure sufficient training data. To solve this problem, a cross-domain adaptation technique can be utilized. In this study, we propose an adversarial consistency-maintaining transformation learning method that can maintain failure classification consistency even for the new untrained environmental data using the rotating body vibration data. The data generated through consistent learning creates a continuous invariant latent space between the new operating condition data distribution and the known data distribution and learns to maintain the failure classification performance through an adversarial learning network that shares the failure classification characteristic nformation. Therefore, the proposed method can provide a more stable and general classification performance by expanding the potential space to minimize the discrepancy between domain data. The experimental results of the proposed model showed about 88% accuracy for a real-machine dataset, and compared to the existing cross-domain adaptive learning methods, it showed a performance improvement of about 5-10%. According to the results of this study, it is expected to be an effective solution for the problem of equipment failure diagnosis at actual industrial sites."

The former is characterized by time politics forming contradiction of total labor and capital, collective patience as a norm for workers, savings as a rule for distributing working hours. In the 21st century, the logic of dualization penetrated the rules of working time. In time politics, the confrontation between labor and labor over the distribution of lifetime working hours has come to the fore, creating conflicts between insiders and outsiders, present and future workers. While insiders fight for a wage increase and extension of lifetime working hours which could reduce necessary working hours for them, outsiders adopt individual patience as their mode of action to increase actual working hours. Debt-based house buying model, which draws future working hours into the present, reinforces the insider-outsider division. The segmented working time regime suggests that there is a serious problem in the social distribution of working time. The working time regime should be reorganized to realize decent working hours evenly."

Currently, a large amount of literature studies inclusive leadership and its direct impact on employees' innovative behaviors.However, few studies have explored the internal mechanism of action between inclusive leadership and innovative behavior. This study investigates how inclusive leadership influences employees' innovative behavior through error management climate and self-efficacy. Taking error management climate and self-efficacy as intermediary variables, the author constructs a theoretical, conceptual model of the dual-path mechanism of inclusive leadership on employees' innovative behavior based on multiple mediating variables. The author conducts an online questionnaire survey of on-the-job employees of Chinese Internet technology companies and adopts SPSS21.0 and AMOS 24.0 to carry out an empirical analysis of the questionnaire survey data. The result shows that inclusive leadership has a significant positive impact on employees' innovative behavior, error management climate, and self-efficacy. Meanwhile, error management climate and self-efficacy also reflect the intermediary effect in the relationship between inclusive leadership and employee innovative behavior."

Then, we conducted a survey of SMEs related to ICT devices that experienced makerspace, and analyzed their opinions on D·N·A technology demand, management difficulties, and governments’ support policies. As results, the study proposed several improvement measures to upgrade  makerspace as a digital conversion platform as follows. First, due to the nature of the existing industry for introducing D·N·A technology, there is a limit for companies to enter the market on their own, so comprehensive support from the government is needed. Second, it is necessary to establish and expand an empirical test bed for the development of new products and services so that various types of metaverse contents can be discovered and digital transformation convergence models of existing businesses can be derived. Third, by modifying the support method to operate the makerspace as a platform that implements the government-led start-up support policy, boldly transfer what the private sector can do well to the private sector. The participants of Industry·University·Institute Collaboration should freely share ideas and help the common problem be solved.

Initial fault state diagnosis using current data, which is difficult to solve with FFT data, is performed with STFT and CWT data, and performance is evaluated through LRP. Experimental Results STFT and CWT are preprocessing techniques that enable the use of current signals for early fault diagnosis. Among the two preprocessing methods, the use of CWT is more preferable because the flexibility of the preprocessing is increased."

In this respect, it is crucial to capture the spatial-temporal structure information of each movement. However, sign language translation studies based on Sign2Gloss2Text only convey comprehensive spatial-temporal information about the entire sign language movement. Consequently, detailed information (facial expression, gestures, and etc.) of each movement that is important for sign language translation is not emphasized. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose Spatial-temporal Keypoints Centered Sign2Gloss2Text Translation, named STKC-Sign2 Gloss2Text, to supplement the sequential and semantic information of keypoints which are the core of recognizing and translating sign language. STKC-Sign2Gloss2Text consists of two steps, Spatial Keypoints Embedding, which extracts 121 major keypoints from each image, and Temporal Keypoints Embedding, which emphasizes sequential information using Bi-GRU for extracted keypoints of sign language. The proposed model outperformed all Bilingual Evaluation Understudy(BLEU) scores in Development(DEV) and Testing(TEST) than Sign2Gloss2Text as the baseline, and in particular, it proved the effectiveness of the proposed methodology by achieving 23.19, an improvement of 1.87 based on TEST BLEU-4."

Therefore, this study proposes a multi-level smart city governance (MSCG) framework for technological cooperation with smart city promotion cities, central governments, and smart city policies as a cooperative model for promoting smart cities and services across the central government, local government, civil society, and academia.In the era of digital transformation, a key element of the MSCG framework to revitalize smart city services is that first, it is not a horizontal organization divided by the existing legal system, but a network type that can link smart city promotion cities, central governments, and policies and technologies. Second, MSCG is characterized by multi-layered governance. Due to the nature of smart cities, the importance of multi-layered governance is emphasized. Third, MSCG has the advantage of being able to become a hub through the synthesis of smart city policies and technologies, not through the smart city promotion policy network.In this paper, it was analyzed by presenting an example of the concept of the MSCG framework through the analysis of the smart city service certified city."
Cranial and Spinal Window Preparation for  in vivo Optical Neuroimaging in Rodents and Related Experimental Techniques,2022,"['Neuroimaging', 'Functional neuroimaging', 'Optical imaging', 'Central nervous system', 'Craniotomy', 'Laboratory animal models']",,"Optical neuroimaging provides an effective neuroscience tool for multi-scale investigation of the neural structures and functions, ranging from molecular, cellular activities to the inter-regional connectivity assessment. Amongst experimental preparations, the implementation of an artificial window to the central nervous system (CNS) is primarily required for optical visualization of the CNS and associated brain activities through the opaque skin and bone. Either thinning down or removing portions of the skull or spine is necessary for unobstructed long-term in vivo observations, for which types of the cranial and spinal window and applied materials vary depending on the study objectives. As diversely useful, a window can be designed to accommodate other experimental methods such as electrophysiology or optogenetics. Moreover, auxiliary apparatuses would allow the recording in synchrony with behavior of large-scale brain connectivity signals across the CNS, such as olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Such advancements in the cranial and spinal window have resulted in a paradigm shift in neuroscience, enabling in vivo investigation of the brain function and dysfunction at the microscopic, cellular level. This Review addresses the types and classifications of windows used in optical neuroimaging while describing how to perform in vivo studies using rodent models in combination with other experimental modalities during behavioral tests. The cranial and spinal window has enabled longitudinal examination of evolving neural mechanisms via in situ visualization of the brain. We expect transformable and multi-functional cranial and spinal windows to become commonplace in neuroscience laboratories, further facilitating advances in optical neuroimaging systems."

In South Korea, many local governments try to convert to smart cities, and however, experts have criticized how local governments seek to switch to smart cities. For this reason, this study attempted to investigate the disaster management of local governments in smart cities by analyzing the cases of local governments applying digital twin technology to the disaster field. To this end, this study selected cases based on two criteria: First, from the perspective of the sustainability of smart cities, it focused on disaster response areas that are of high importance but do not receive much attention when establishing basic strategies. Second, it focused on the digital twin technology, which is in the limelight as the core technology of smart cities. Based on the analysis results, local government policies for smart city disaster management in digital transformation are suggested."

Oxidative desulfurization(ODS) is preferable due to low cost and mild operating conditions. Coupling of the extractive catalytic desulfurization with the ODS give rise to extractive catalytic oxidative desulfurization(ECODS), a more promising for the elimination of sulfur contents of fuel oil. Herein we present by polyoxometalate based hybrids, [H2TPP][K5BVW11O40]•2CH3CN•2H2O (1), [H2TPP]2[K3BVW11O40]•CH3CN•3H2O (2), and [H2TPP]3[KBVW11O40]•2CH3CN (3) for efficient ECODS of hazardous model fuel. These were synthesized by facile method and characterized by elemental analysis, inductive couple plasma, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, thermo-gravimetric/differential thermal analysis, fourier transform infrared, and UV–visible analysis. These polyoxometalate based hybrids contain cations [H2TPP]2+(organic) and [BVW11O40]7−(inorganic) with stoichiometric ratios(i.e., 1:1, 2:1, 3:1). The stoichiometry of these hybrids was also established by Job’s analysis which agreed well with the results of TG-DTA and elemental analyses. Interestingly, an increase in catalytic efficiency is observed with increase of organic cations.

To this end, the study identifies the simulacre theory of Platōn, Gilles Deleuze, and Jean Baudrillard through literature research methods. In particular, Baudrillard’s “the successive phases of the image” is interpreted as a digital collage process and the results of the interpretation are expanded to elementary art education methods. The results of the study are as follows. First, digital images and simulacre aesthetics are closely related. Digital images themselves can be considered as simulacre, and the creation of digital images as virtual and new digital images through technological replication and variants is called simulacre aesthetics. Second, the way digital collage works can be interpreted as simulacre aesthetics. The process of working on digital collage, produced by the reproduction, editing, and combination of images that reflect reality, is in line with the process of transforming images into simulacre. Third, the digital image production activity model based on simulacre aesthetics is presented as subject selection, realistic image production and choice, planning and implementation of image reconstruction, simulacre creation, and self-circulating variation of simulacre."

The test problem we chose was the exploding wires immersed in a water environment, as the material transforms from a solid state to liquid and finally to gas phases. A new plasma equation of state (EOS) was obtained for this study. The shock and plasma fronts were captured in the several locations in water.

This approach seemed to act as a countermeasure to overcome social dilemmas and address the economic recession caused by COVID-19. Additionally, the Serious Disaster Punishment Act came into effect on January 27, 2022. This bill focuses on strengthening criminal penalties for business owners in the event of an industrial accident that causes serious human harm. After its enforcement, significant interest was placed on construction sites, eventually leading to changes being made for a safer working environment and developing a more effective construction method. Off-Site-Construction (OSC) is one of the safest construction methods with minimal on-site work, ultimately avoiding potential industrial accidents. Increasingly, the need for the Building Information Modeling (BIM) design process along with modular architecture based on OSC is in demand. This research intends to suggest modular architecture based on OSC as an alternative in response to the increasing demand for on-site safety and for constructing reasonable, eco-friendly buildings for future generations. The ‘Modular Co-living Complex’ apartment house is considered the most applicable architectural form, therefore, technological improvements and overall efficiency is required. To propose a safer, more efficient, and sustainable building construction method, this study seeks to focus on the analysis of domestic and international case studies of the preceded modular co-living complexes; the applicability of BIM technology to maximize the performance in the modular architectural design process was also examined. Ultimately, this study suggests the ‘BIM-based modular integrated design’ model where the architectural project easily converges into a much simpler process and explores the most useful, effective methods in practice."

Free movement of labor forces was transformed to the ‘migration’ of today since the end of the 19th century, as the national state building and the nationalism were intertwined. As the national state was regarded as the basic unit consisting of the world, migrants went through the process of ‘othering’. From the point of view treating national border as the border of society, the popular concept of migrants was engraved as the ‘uprooted,’ the ‘outsider’ of the society, and the gnawer of the social welfare system in the national state.The study zooms in on the fact that this negative view on migrants was embedded into the ‘methodological nationalism,’ which assumes the network of social life being built in a single container of national society. However, the migrants life not only of today, but also of late 19th century has been significantly transnational. Migrants of late 19th century built transnational networks and kept continuous relationship to their home countries. In order to dispel the national discourse overlaid on the migrants, it is necessary to break away from the container perspective based on the trinity of territory-population- culture."

After several failed attempts for last two decades, the reform bill of the PM Marin’s government was finally passed through the Eduskunta (Finnish Parliament) in June 2021. The core aims of the bill are to create 21 wellbeing services counties (hyvinvointialueet), to transfer the responsibility to provide social and health services from municipalities to the newly established administrative organizations, and to develop Future Health and Social Services Centres (Tulevaisuuden sosiaali- ja terveyskeskukset) for the improvement of service accessibility and the reduction of inequality in service provision. The first elections to constitute 21 county councils were held on 23 January, 2022. During the election campaign, the key issues were about how to fix both inequality and inefficiency simultaneously and how to reform the decision-making system related to social and health services. The findings from this study on the Finnish case demonstrate that the role of public organizations will be emphasized and strengthened in the new service delivery system, and the three-tier governance of “central government-wellbeing services counties-municipalities” will replace the existing two-tier governance of “central government- municipalities.”"

The purpose of this study is to develop smart product-service system (Smart PSS) solutions based on the needs of the disabled and the elderly and for their practical use. To propose an inclusive integrated platform, we integrate Smart PSS into a major area of life.Methods Based on the literature review, the expanded living area of the disabled and the elderly was established, and we developed the main themes of Smart PSS. This was derived from analyzing Smart PSS cases for the disabled and the elderly with a perspective of consumers. In addition, a proto-research persona was established by deriving a persona variable related to the use of Smart PSS. Based on the main themes and persona of Smart PSS, in-depth interviews with consumers and persons concerned were conducted to derive core needs and service development directions for each persona. Conducting in-depth interviews with information and communications technology(ICT) and policy experts to develop Smart PSS solutions was considered feasible.Results The results of this study are divided into two main categories. First, developing Smart PSS solutions were derived by the needs for each persona of the physically disabled, deaf, blind, and elderly, and based on this, we proposed a scenario that embodies the solution utilization process. Second, we integrated service functions that can be connected and integrated on a scenario-based basis, and we derived four inclusive integrated platforms according to the purpose, function, and utilization space of the solution, which was presented as 'Smart Home Integration Platform', 'Healthcare Integration Platform', 'Mobility Integration Platform', and 'Communication Integration Platform'. Specifically, we proposed a service blueprint framework suitable for smart PSS modeling, and through this, we visualized and designed each platform with a blueprint.Conclusions This study is meaningful in that it develops a Smart PSS solution based on the core needs of the disabled and the elderly and proposes an inclusive integrated platform by integrating it based on scenarios. Through this, we are able to propose criteria for basic service functions and standards for inclusive values. In addition, we develop a blueprint framework for Smart PSS that visualizes data flow based on touchpoint connections.

Through the structural equation model (SEM), this study investigated the relationship between hybrid work satisfaction, leadership's effect on performance, and performance through job characteristics. This study demonstrated that hybrid work satisfaction had a positive effect on both work performance and organizational performance. In the case of leadership, transactional leadership had a positive effect on organizational performance but a negative effect on individual job performance, and transformative leadership had a positive effect on both job performance and organizational performance. In addition, both leaderships had a positive effect on work autonomy. This study demonstrated that the higher the workload and work autonomy were recognized, the higher the job performance and organizational performance were recognized. In terms of the mediating effect of job characteristics, work autonomy had a mediating effect between 'hybrid work satisfaction - performance' and 'leadership - performance'. In the case of workload recognition, it had a mediating effect only between 'hybrid work satisfaction - performance'. This study will not only approach timely research topics theoretically and empirically but also provide policy and practical implications to personnel managers in the public sector based on the analysis results."

In MVT, thetransverse shear stress fields are obtained from the third-order zigzag model, whereas the displacement fields ofthe conventional first-order model are considered to amplify the benefits of numerical efficiency. Additionally,a transverse displacement field with a smooth parabolic distribution is introduced to accurately predict thethermal behavior of composite structures. Furthermore, the concept of Laplace transformation is newlyemployed to simplify the viscoelastic problem, similar to the linear-elastic problem. To demonstrate theperformance of the proposed theory, the numerical results obtained herein were compared with those availablein the literature."

A Study on Design and Fabrication Methodologies with Heat-Induced Self-Reinforcing Polymer,2022,"['Material Computation', 'Computing Material', 'Polymer', 'Digital Form Finding', 'Viscoelasticity', '메테리얼 컴퓨테이션', '컴퓨팅 메티리얼', '폴리머', '디지털 폼 파인딩', '점탄성']",,"(Background and Purpose) This research paper aims to investigate a unique design process that digitally manipulates the morphological transformations of a heat-induced self-reinforcing polymer. The principle of the heat-induced contractile polymer has long been implemented in various industries such as packaging and fashion. While other industries have embraced the full potential of the particular soft material, it is still a relatively new material to be further explored in the field of architecture. Yet, with the application of computational tools to architectural form-making and fabrication methodologies, morphological and structural behaviors of heat-induced polymer could become an active material for architectural projects. (Method) There are two modes distinguished in the presented research methodology. First of all, the author conducts the physical investigation of the material system of heat-induced polymers as a design driver. In this stage, the author computes the material behavior of the polymer sheet considering the material thickness of the polymer sheet and the traits of contractile deformation based on the time of heat exposure and the level of temperature on the material. Second, the author explores the digital investigation of a transition system of the physical properties to digital simulation then from the digital model to a fabricatable artifact based on the physical investigation of the heat-induced polymer sheet. In this stage, A series of computational strategies are applied to evaluate and analyze the design that eventually led to the making process. Finally, the latter part of this research paper showcases a built case study titled De:flatable. The study demonstrates the process of digitally comprehending the morphological transformation of a soft material, ultimately realizing the most optimal form through rapid prototyping with varying parameters. (Results) The presented paper proves the resilience of the design process and aims to revisit the reciprocity of physical and digital, of formal and structural, and of design and fabrication through comparing the physical scale models and digital form-finding prototypes. And in lieu of the spirit of recalibration, the research is experimentation in imprecision. (Conclusions) Not only an imprecision by the nature of the polymer’s intrinsic soft materiality but the imprecision of the digital translation of the morphological behavior of viscoelasticity. But as the following research demonstrates, it is within the imprecision and the infidelity of both physical material and computation tools that interpret the material that leads to the production of a form and a design process that hints at new possibilities in architectural design."

Previously, the number of studies that defined smoothness with the concept of curvature has been limited. The parameters were the two physical characteristics of curvature: the number of waves and the amplitude of them. The purpose of the study was to observe which of the two parameters influences the perception of smoothness and to examine the relationship between the sense of aesthetic beauty and smoothness. The visual stimuli used in the study were transformed three-dimensional spheres, based on the combination of the three levels of the two parameters of nine distinct conditions. We analyzed the three responses that measured the preference of each visual stimuli, the familiarity score, and the smoothness evaluation score, each with the linear mixed model whose fixed effects were the two parameters and random effects were the participants’ individual differences. Nearly the eighty percent of the variance of the smoothness evaluation score was explained by the linear model with the two key parameters and their interaction. The physical characteristics of a viewed object were far more significant than individual differences such as personality factors and the manner of art appreciation.In conclusion, the study examined the perception of smoothness based on the change of the physical characteristics of a shape. The study further recognized the relationship between smoothness and the aesthetic preference. No significant influence of the participants’ individual difference such as gender, the degree in fine arts, personality factors, and the manner of art appreciation was observed. The amplitude of waves, rather than the number of them, was far more significant to the perception of smoothness."

Tensor Product Based Polytopic LPV System Design of a 6-DoF Multi-strut Platform,2022,"['Convex combinationpolytopic LPV', 'HOSVD', 'multi-strut platform', 'tensor product.']",,"Multi-strut platform is widely used for precise instrument vibration isolation. In this paper, a NewtonEuler based 6-DOF 12-strut platform model is proposed. Nonlinearity of platform dynamic component is derived by establishing polytopic linear parameter varying (LPV) system. To guarantee the linearization accuracy of LPV system while reducing model elements to a real-time computing level. Tensor product(TP) model transformation and truncated high-order singular value decomposition(HOSVD) are used to decompose LPV system high-order tensor into unique principle basis. Then low-rank approximation of system is implemented by discarding minor singular basis vectors, for the sake of minimizing storage space and computing complexity. And then the parameter varying system is represented by convex combination of discretized system vertexes. So quadratic regulator method can be applied to vertex linear time-invariant subsystem controller to construct the global controller. Performance of the proposed multi-strut platform is demonstrated through hardware in loop simulation."

Because the rotation or scaling operation is frequently involved in copy-move forger, the conventional convolutional neural network is not effectively applied in detecting copy-move tampering. Therefore, we divide the input into rotation-invariant and scaling-invariant features based on the wavelet coefficients. Each of the features is input to different branches having the same structure, and is fused in the combination module. Each branch comprises feature extraction, correlation, and mask decoder modules. In the proposed network, VGG16 is used for the feature extraction module. To check similarity of features generated by the feature extraction module, the conventional correlation module used. Finally, the mask decoder model is applied to develop a pixel-level localization map. We perform experiments on test dataset and compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art tampering localization methods.

Unlike Japanese claims that it was compiled by making 『the Annals of King Cheoljong(哲宗)』 a model in respect for the ‘tradition’ of Joseon, 『The Annals of King Gojong』 should be understood within colonial historical studies, because it was compiled by Yiwangjik(李王職) for the collection and editing process of modern historical records, like 『Joseon History』 by Joseon History Compilation Committee. It is imperative for the crtique of colonial historical studies within the colonial period and overcoming the limitations to historical records for the study of Korean modern history to find out how 『The Annals of King Gojong』 was compiled.Japanese Imperial Household Agency(宮內省) asked Asami Rintaro to compile 『The Annals of Yitaewang(李太王)』 immediately after the death of King Gojong, which was compiled, but never disclosed. While Oda Shogo took the lead to compile 『Annals of Gojong and Sunjong』 in Yiwangjik, Dabohashi Giyoshi compiled historical records from coronation year of King Gojong to June 1894 in volume 4 of chapter 6 in 『Joseon History』. It is necessary to compare 『The Annals of Yitaewang』, 『The Annals of King Gojong』, and 『Joseon History』, which were compiled by Japanese imperialism.As 『The Annals of King Gojong』 was compiled as the history of the dynasty, highlighting perfunctory royal protocals, whose pioneering figure was shown in 『The Annals of Yitaewang』 by Asami Rintaro, That is the reason why 『The Annals of King Gojong』 lays the foundation of distortion of King Gojong era, although it was insisted to be compiled in respect for the ‘tradition’ of Joseon. As the history of the Great Han Emipre was compiled as the ‘annals’ of the dynasty, in which the system of historiographer was abolished after the Gabo Reformation, it led to dwindle down transformed social aspects in the era of the Great Han Empire and the process of infringement of sovereignty by Japanese imperialism. There were massive materials collected from the time of Old Customs Investigation, and Kiguchi Kenjo led the collection of modern historical records, however, those materials were not reflected in the compilation of 『The Annals of King Gojong』. In 『Sillogpyeonchansungan』, which was supervised by Japanese, including Oda Shogo, most of historical records were based upon 『Daily Records of the Royal Secretariat(承政院日記)』, 『Ilsungrok(日省錄)』, and the offical gazette. The perfunctory history of King Gojong era was compiled by excerpting only from the chronicles without public and private documents, including government documents of the Great Han Empire.『Joseon History』 chapter 6, volume 4, by Joseon History Compilation Committee was compiled until June 1894, and the era of the Great Han Empire and the era before and after annexation were put aside for 『The Annals of King Gojong』. Thus they could avoid the embarrassment to open sensitive historical records in this era. As a result, the compilation of 『The Annals of King Gojong』 in the form of ‘tradition’ by Yiwangjik, and 『Joseon History』 based upon modern historical method by Joseon History Compilation Committee divided roles, and shaped the recognition framework of modern history by colonial historical studies. In this context, the compilation of annals by Yiwangjik was not separate from the works of Joseon History Compilation Committee, and was pursued hand in hand.Distortion of history of King Gojong era was made by selective exclusion of historical records or intentional contextual arrangement. Fundamental question can be raised about whether it can be ‘actual proof’ in the strict sense when historical records showing modern images in King Gojong era were thorough..."

This study drew design guidelines from the factors of clothing disposal and reuse to propose ways to extend the longevity of clothing. It sets the design goals for the longevity extension of clothing as flexibility, originality, durability, and adjustability and drew a specific design guideline. The design methods used to achieve such goals are as follows. First, the design that is flexible in terms of physical changes needs to increase its activity and to be changeable, by applying pleats, rubber bands and elastic materials to the parts with many physical changes and movements. Second, it is necessary to reinforce the brand identity, create design that is flexible in terms of fashion and design very rare and attractive products, for the goal of original design beyond fashion. Third, it is necessary to increase the quality of clothing and improve the durability which can be decreased by washing and wearing. Fourth, it is necessary to create the design that can produce various styles, preserve the state of clothing and maintain its hygienic conditions by using removable detailed designs, shape-transformation designs and the designs which can be adjusted to climate changes and states, for the goal of adjustable design with better functionality. The findings provide ideas for fashion experts to pay more attention to the extending the longevity of clothing products and to develop eco-friendly designs and strategies."

In FT-IR spectra, the new appeared bands at 1009 cm-1 and 1132 cm-1 confirmed the successful polymerization between hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) and phloretin (Pht). While the SEM results showed that the size of the microspheres was strongly dependent on the HCCP:Pht mole ratio. The crystalline nature of the PCTPPT microspheres was checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and provided evidence for the successful preparation of the microspheres. The thermal stability of the PCTPPT microspheres was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The obtained TGA results showed that the increase in thermal stability was attributed to the highly cross-linked covalently bonded structure of PCTPPT microspheres. The particle size distribution was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the results showed that the decreased HCCP:Pht mole ratio increases the size of the microspheres. The PCTPPT-3 microspheres were used as drug carriers for a model drug camptothecin (CPT). The experimental findings showed a cumulative release of 41.0% in pH 4.0 and 32.6% in pH 7.4 after 350 h and the PCTPPT-3/CPT microspheres have good drug loading capability and controlled release property for CPT."

This study also focused on the stance of Russian government towards social welfare-related workers among diverse crossroads. The situations of the times required a more firm social welfare system and more professionalized social welfare workers. At that time, social welfare-related workers were warriors to fight in the front lie of Russian social welfare field. The purpose of this study is to analyze the stance of Russian government towards social welfare-related workers in the age of transportation and classification of related policies and fundamentally understand Russian government’s real intention towards the weak. During the regime transition, Russian government cut down on finances of social welfare system and even reduced or privatized social welfare facilities that protected the social weak, under the pretext of efficient distribution of national finances. Undoubtedly, the pain of the social weak was aggravated in this process. What was the stance of Russian government towards social welfare-related workers, who played a role as the last rescue line for the social weak, this time? This study demonstrates that Russian government was indifferent to, or intentionally neglected social welfare workers. This indifference or intentional negligence of Russian government towards social welfare-related workers led to a low-quality social welfare service and ultimately played a decisive role in increasing the difficulty of the social weak. According to the Titmuss social welfare model theory, the stance of Russian government towards social welfare-related workers in the age of transformation can be classified into a residual type. Considering the tough situation that the social weak faced at that time, also, it is hard to say that this stance of Russian government was a good choice, from the perspective of social welfare."

The Korean church also faces various problematics and challenges from the inside and outside such as the individualistic and privatized approach to the Gospel, an inherited problem of prosperity theology, an inability to communicate with society, a loss of social trust and decline of its public image, the spread of atheism among young generation, and the emergence of a Nano society. New understandings of mission in missioloy—an emphasis of the publicity of the Gospel, a more expanded horizon of mission, a laity centered mission, the importance of local community in mission, and the emergence of metaverse as new field of mission—require an alternative model of mission and mission education.  In response to these contemporary challenges and risks with holistic gospel, this essay attempts to reconceptualize traditional understandings of mission and, especially, to pose holistic mission education in dialogue with public theology. First, three traditions of public theology in the Scriptures and history of theology and church are discussed: 1) the formation of a just and equal community, 2) the transformation of unjust and unequal realities, 3) conversations with the world and an apology to the world through the Gospel. Grounded in these three traditions of public theology, this essay explores the essential characteristics of contemporary public theology. The final section is devoted to presenting the aims of education, educational principles (contextual and hermeneutic principle, holistic principle, and principle of trinitarian praxis) and main contents and methods of education(formation of mission spirit and studying Bible and theology, equipping with competence of formation of just and equal community, of transformation of unjust and unequal realities, and of conversation and communication of Gospel)."

This paper proposes an object-based image retrival (OBIR) problem of finding an image containing an object same as a given image. Traditional image retrieval techniques use global or local features to search for similar images, which makes it difficult to obtain object information if a given image has a complex background or if the object of the image is small. To address this, we propose object embedding and image retrieval techniques using the latest object recognition models, DETR (Detection Transformer) and Bag of Visual Words (BoVW), which can represent object information regardless of background. This paper conduct a comparative experiment with existing image retrieval techniques using COCO data mainly used in object recognition problems and AID, Oxford & Paris data used in existing image retrieval techniques, and show that DETR-based BoVW outperforms existing methods in OBIR problems."

These results indicate that the textural properties of MWW were well preserved after acid treatment and incorporation of titanium. An adsorptive-oxidative desulfurization (AODS) system was successfully developed on the basis of a model oil containing dibenzothiophene (DBT) with the as-prepared Ti- MWW being the catalyst and adsorbent and cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) being the oxidant. The parameters influencing the desulfurization performance were systematically investigated. These parameters include the Ti-MWW dosage, the reaction temperature, the stirring speed, the molar ratio of CHP to DBT and the additions of olefins and aromatics to the system. The conversion rate of DBT reached 99.6% via the catalytic oxidation process and the turnover frequency was 40.1 h1. Meanwhile, the oxidation products of DBT were removed by Ti-MWW adsorption. The recycling and regeneration performance of Ti-MWW were also investigated, and the DBT conversion reached 99.5% using the regenerated Ti-MWW.

Accordingly, discussions on how to cope with the conflict between innovation and regulation have also taken a new turn. Under the judgment that there is a limit to easing the conflict between innovation and regulation through the previous regulatory reform method, discussions were made on a new deregulation mechanism that can alleviate the conflict between the two. As a result, a system that preemptively suspends or exempts existing regulations on the premise of certain conditions, that is, a regulatory sandbox system, was introduced.Korea's regulatory sandbox system is operated in a form that further develops the model of countries that have introduced and operated the sandbox system, such as the UK and Japan. Basically, it is assumed that the regulatory sandbox system is applied to all new industries, not specific fields such as finance. In addition, focusing on the “Test-Bed” system, it is assumed that (i) the “Quickly check” system that checks the existence of regulations and (ii) the “Temporary Permission” system that allows preemptive market launch on the premise of securing safety. Regulatory sandbox system has received great social attention in that it can bring about various advantages such as efficiently supporting corporate innovative activities and improving consumer benefits. As a result, by the end of December 2021, the number of regulatory sandbox approvals exceeded expectations was recorded, and remarkable results such as actual investment, sales, and employment growth were also achieved.However, as Korea regulates the regulatory sandbox system through a number of individual laws, it has a number of tasks in terms of efficient operation or activation of the system, including institutional and practical conflicts. In this study, the significance and performance of the regulatory sandbox system were specifically reviewed, and the justification of the system was clarified based on this. Then, it was judged that companies seeking innovation need to use the regulatory sandbox system as much as possible, and the balance between promoting innovation(or convergence) and consumer protection was reviewed."
Linear Pseudospectral Entry Guidance Algorithm Using Differential Flat Output for High Lift-to-Drag Ratio Entry Vehicle,2022,"['Entry guidance algorithm', 'Differential flatness', 'Optimal control', 'Gaussian pseudospectral method']",,"This paper aims at proposing an entry guidance algorithm for high lift-to-drag ratio entry vehicle, which is based on linear pseudospectral model predictive control and differential flatness theory. The algorithm consists of two phases: descent phase and glide phase. First, the longitudinal plane of the entry process is differentially flat, and the nonlinear system in the longitudinal plane can be transformed into a linear system using the properties of the differential flat system. Then, considering quadratic performance index, the entry longitudinal plane guidance problem is transformed into a linear optimal control problem with terminal constraints. Collocation with Legendre–Gaussian points is used to translate them into a set of algebraic equations. And then, the guidance commands of longitudinal plane, which reduce terminal errors, can be derived in an analytical manner in the form of polynomials. Finally, the heading angle error corridor is used to control the lateral plane motion to obtain the final guidance commands. To evaluate the guidance performance and robustness of the proposed algorithm, nominal trajectory simulation and Monte Carlo simulation were carried out for different target positions. The results show that this method has high computational efficiency, high numerical accuracy, strong adaptability, and robustness, which is applicable for many entry scenarios."

Existing models of the tectonic history of the region provide contrasting interpretation of the timing of formation of the crust (Mesozoic to Cenozoic), crust type (from hyper-extended continental crust to oceanic crust), and formation process (from parallel/fan-shaped rifting to transformation faulting). To help determine the age of the oceanic crust, the geothermal gradient was measured at three stations in the south of abyssal plain at depth of 2,160-2,250 m below sea level. Heat flow measurement stations were located perpendicular to the spreading axis over a 40 km-long transect. In-situ thermal conductivity measurement, corrected by the laboratory test, gave observed marine heat flows of 55 to 61 mW/m2. All measurements were taken during Arctic expeditions in 2018 (ARA09C expedition) and 2021 (ARA12C expedition) by the Korean ice-breaking research vessel (IBRV) Araon. Given the assumption of oceanic crust, the results correspond to formation in the Late Cretaceous (Mesozoic). The inferred age supports the hypothesis of formation activated by the opening of the Makarov Basin during the Late Mesozoic-Cenozoic. This would make it contemporaneous with rifting of the Chukchi Border Land immediately east of the abyssal plain. The heat flow data indicate the base of the gas hydrate stability zone is located 332-367 m below the seafloor, this will help to identify the gas hydrate-related bottom simulating reflector in the future seismic survey, as already identified on the Chukchi Plateau. Further geophysical surveys, including heat flow measurements, are required to increase our understanding of the formation process and thermal mantle structure of the abyssal plain."

A model and governing equations for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses of swash-plate type hydraulic piston pumps were built, and simulation results regarding the internal flow field of the pump were obtained. By analyzing the internal flow of the swash-plate type hydraulic piston pump, we can confirm the time-dependent stroke of each piston as the pump rotates. We also verified that by analyzing the pulsating flow against the slope of the swash plate, the simulation results match well with the experimental results. The natural frequency of the system was computed to be approximately 380 Hz by applying and analyzing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of each swash plate slope evaluated."

The farmer production groups have gradually transformed and emerged into strong cooperatives or associations. The purpose of this study was to examine the factors affecting farmers’ participation in FPGs. Data were collected from primary and secondary sources. A total of 140 respondents participated in a field survey in three kumb ban (village groups) in the Xepon District. Descriptive statistics and binary logistics regression models were used to analyze the data. The results show that the education level of household head, farmland size, access to credit, and perceived trust for farmer production group membership are significantly different from those who are non-members of the groups. However, non-members of FPGs face more constrain in accessing the market, as compared to the members of FPGs. The empirical results from the Binary Logit Model indicate that education level of headed household, farmland size, access to credit, perceived trust, and constraint to market are factors that significantly determine farmers’ participation in FPGs. This study contributes to the empirical literature by providing a better understanding of farmer participation in the groups. The government of Laos should consider and promote access to credit, farmer learning, and market integration to improve farmers' participation in FPGs."
An Abnormal Pattern Detection Scheme Based on GCN and DBSCAN in a Large-Scale Graph,2022,"['Anomaly Detection', 'Abnormal Pattern Detection', 'GCNs', 'DBSCAN', 'Large-Scale Graph']",,"In recent decades, anomaly detection has undoubtedly become one of the most important areas of research. This is because applications such as financial transactions, medical fraud, and anomaly detection can be used to solve a wide range of real-life problems. Data from these applications can be modeled using large graphs of many different nodes and edges. Because of the size and heterogeneity of the data contained in the graph, it is a very difficult task to detect abnormal patterns. In this paper, we proposed a method for detecting abnormal patterns in a large homogeneous graph. The proposed method consisted of two steps. In the first step, the graph was transformed into a vector using a semi-supervised graph neural network (GCN).The second step was based on DBSCAN, an unsupervised clustering method. Various performance evaluations were performed to show the superiority of the proposed method. Experimental results showed that the proposed method could detect abnormal nodes with high accuracy in homogeneous static graphs."
A Siamese hybrid neural network framework for few-shot fault diagnosis of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles,2022,"['fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles', 'few-shot learning', 'fault diagnosis', 'metric learning', 'deep learning']",,"As fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (FW-UAVs) are used for diverse civil and scientific missions, failure incidents are on the rise. Recent rapid developments in deep learning (DL) techniques offer advanced solutions for fault diagnosis of unmanned aerial vehicles. However, most existing DL-based diagnostic models only perform well when trained on massive amounts of labeled data, which are challenging to collect due to the complexity of the FW-UAVs systems and service environments. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel framework, Siamese hybrid neural network (SHNN), to achieve few-shot fault diagnosis of FW-UAVs in an intelligent manner. “State map” strategy is firstly proposed to transform raw flight data into similar and dissimilar sample pairs as input. The proposed SHNN framework consists of two identical networks that share weights with each other, and each subnetwork is designed with a hybrid one-dimensional conventional neural network and long short-term memory model as feature encoder, whose generated feature embedding is used to measure the similarity of input pairs via a distance function in the metric space. In comprehensive experiments on a real flight dataset of an FW-UAV, the SHNN framework achieves competitive results compared to other models, demonstrating its effectiveness in both binary and multi-class few-shot fault diagnosis."
Finite-time Fault-tolerant Control of Robotic Systems with Uncertain Dynamics,2022,"['Backstepping', 'fault-tolerant control', 'finite-time control', 'observer', 'robotic systems.']",,"Control of nonlinear robotic systems suffering from actuator failure is a significant, yet challenging problem. In this paper, an observer-based fault-tolerant control method is proposed for robotic systems with external disturbances and modeling discrepancy. Technically, based on the state transform, an unknown input observer is designed to estimate the lumped unknown input. With the aid of the proposed observer, the estimate error is ensured to decay to zero within finite time. Subsequently, the estimated unknown input is utilized to compensate the compound unknown input of the faulty system. The analytical results proved that the tracking error of the closedloop system converges to zero in finite-time, even in the presence of actuator faults. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

In this regard, material production is typically achieved based on transformation technology, mediated via microinjection, in which a target gene is inserted into eggs containing an embryo. However, an essential step in the microinjection procedure is egg fixation, which can be a time-consuming and laborious task. Therefore, in this study, using the 3DCADian program, we adopted a 3D printing approach to model egg liners and glue drawers, which can contribute to facilitating egg alignment and fixation, thereby enhancing transformation efficiency by reducing time consumption and fatigue. After rendering using Fusion 360, the two supplementary tools were produced by printing with nylon resin (PA12) and Sinterit Lisa Pro.Subsequent analysis of the time required to fix eggs on glass slides using the two manufactured tools, revealed that the processing time was reduced by approximately 18.6% when the two tools were used compared with when these tools were not used. These innovations not only reduced fatigue but also contributed to more effective use of the microscope and manipulator for microinjection. Consequently, we believe that with additional research and refinement, the egg liner and glue drawer developed in this study could be used to enhance silkworm transformation efficiency and study similar transformation systems in other industrial insects."

I’ve trailed the last 20 years of the Namwon N cooperative and store, which was considered a hub space for local civil society but was recently transformed into a delocalized franchise store. I analyzed the case from the perspective of the ‘clashes of scale’ and the theory of demutualization. The cooperative is specifically constituted of two different organizations. One consists of cooperatives based on the particular local space and face-to-face relationships, and the other is the central association of all cooperatives whose scale is far more abstract and market-oriented. In this study, I meticulously scrutinized the negotiation process and the struggle between these two in as much detail as possible. At the beginning, the local cooperative leaded the social movement this was in the name of “local food” and “for agriculture and for farmer”. The participation for solidarity was the key asset of itself. However, through all of these processes - capitalistic instrumentalization, delocalization of human resources and finance, loss of sense of place, invisibility of agriculture and farmers in the region, a medicalized policy and so forth. Rights of consumers, food safety, democratic autonomous participation of individuals are considered as the most valuable things in recent times. The local cooperative has increasingly become another sort of hub space solely for delivering the agendas from the central association to the individuals within the local community such as: a campaign booth. Historically, there was a friendly social practice among the neighbors they shared democratic agendas in the stores. However, after 20 years the store which previously held significant social value has now merely become a franchise store which is based on the capitalization of the food industry."
Communication Resource Allocation Strategy of Internet of Vehicles Based on MEC,2022,"['Allocation of Communication Resources', 'Genetic Algorithm', 'Internet of Vehicles', 'Knapsack Problem', 'MEC']",,"The business of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is growing rapidly, and the large amount of data exchange has causedproblems of large mobile network communication delay and large energy loss. A strategy for resourceallocation of IoV communication based on mobile edge computing (MEC) is thus proposed. First, a model ofthe cloud-side collaborative cache and resource allocation system for the IoV is designed. Vehicles can offloadtasks to MEC servers or neighboring vehicles for communication. Then, the communication model and thecalculation model of IoV system are comprehensively analyzed. The optimization objective of minimizingdelay and energy consumption is constructed. Finally, the on-board computing task is coded, and theoptimization problem is transformed into a knapsack problem. The optimal resource allocation strategy isobtained through genetic algorithm. The simulation results based on the MATLAB platform show that: Theproposed strategy offloads tasks to the MEC server or neighboring vehicles, making full use of systemresources. In different situations, the energy consumption does not exceed 300 J and 180 J, with an averagedelay of 210 ms, effectively reducing system overhead and improving response speed."
Hall Current and Viscous Dissipation Impact on MHD Mixed Convection Flow towards a Porous Exponentially Surface with its Engineering Applications,2022,"['hall current', 'porous medium', 'mixed convection', 'MHD', 'thermal radiation', 'viscous dissipation', 'numerically']",,"Power generators, Hall accelerators, and flight MHD all require high levels of Hall current. The influence of Hall current and viscous dissipation on time-independent hydro-magnetic mixed convective radiative flow across a porous heated surface has thus been investigated using numerical computing and mathematical modeling in the current study. The fluid is electrically conducted and varies exponentially. It is assumed that the wall temperature and elongation rate will vary with specific exponential shapes. A solid uniform magnetic field B0 is employed normally to the surface. The mathematical model of PDEs for incompressible flow is transformed into ODE by applying a numerical technique based on a finite-difference structure which includes a three-stage Lobatto IIIa scheme with the help of MATLAB. The obtained solution depends on the convergence constraints involving the radiation parameter R, magnetic parameter M, porosity parameter Ω, Hall parameter m, buoyancy parameter ε, temperature distribution parameter a, Eckert number Ec, Prandtl number Pr, and convective term bh. Graphs of the velocity and temperature profiles are explained via pertinent parameters. Skin friction factor, and Nusselt number are also evaluated and presented graphically and in tabular form. Results clarify that temperature profile reduces by increasing values of temperature distribution parameter whereas opposite behavior is noted for positive values of the buoyancy parameter."

The proposed solution converges faster than the simplified Parlange Solution, and is very close to the Philip Solution, with a difference of less than 5%. The proposed solution has strict analytical steps and clear mathematical significance, which can be regarded as a supplement to the Parlange Model in a key step."

Samples were characterized by small-angle X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, granulometric analysis, and nitrogen adsorption techniques.The PEI loading rate and CO2 adsorption-desorption performance were determined via thermogravimetric analysis. The effects of pore expansion, heteroatom Al incorporation, PEI loading rate, and Si/Al ratio on CO2 adsorption performance were examined. For the first time, the amount of PEI impregnated in PM41 was increased beyond 55 wt%, and the low-Si/Al-ratio PM41Ax support was used to load PEI in a novel procedure. Results show that at the same PEI loading rate, PM41 is always superior to M41 regarding adsorption capacity and adsorption rate. For a PEI loading rate >50 wt%, the superiority is amplified, reaching 15.9% and 21.3%, respectively. The use of the high-Al-containing PM41Ax support further increases adsorption capacity and adsorption rate by 13.4% and 9.6%, respectively.The presented reaction has a hybrid adsorption characteristic that includes both chemisorption and physisorption.Avrami’s fractional-order kinetic model describes the adsorption best. Over the entire time scale, the adsorption rate is determined by several kinetic diffusion-controlled processes. The intraparticle diffusion and equilibrium adsorption are two predominant rate-limiting steps, and their control ranges change with temperature. After five cycles of adsorption and desorption, the desorption ratio was as high as 99%, and the working capacity still retained 96.5% of the original capacity. In addition, the presence of water vapor increased the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents presented in this study. These advantages make them successful iin capturing CO2 in the post-combustion scenario."
Thinking multiculturality in the age of hybrid threats: Converging cyber and physical security in Akkuyu nuclear power plant,2022,"['Nuclear power plants', 'Nuclear security', 'Security culture', 'Nuclear security culture', 'National culture', 'Cyber-physical security']",,"Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) are the most protected facilities among all critical infrastructures (CIs). In addition to physical security, cyber security becomes a significant concern for NPPs since swift digitalization and overreliance on computer-based systems in the facility operations transformed NPPs into targets for cyber/physical attacks. Despite technical competencies, humans are still the central component of a resilient NPP to develop an effective nuclear security culture.Turkey is one of the newcomers in the nuclear energy industry, and Turkish Akkuyu NPP has a unique model owned by an international consortium. Since Turkey has limited experience in nuclear energy industry, specific multinational and multicultural characteristics of Turkish Akkuyu NPP also requires further research in terms of the Facility's prospective nuclear security. Yet, the link between “national cultures” and “nuclear security” is underestimated in nuclear security studies. By relying on Hofstede's national culture framework, our research aims to address this gap and explore possible implications of cross-national cultural differences on nuclear security. To cope with security challenges in the age of hybrid threats, we propose a security management model which addresses the need for cyber-physical security integration to cultivate a robust nuclear security culture in a multicultural working environment"

This study employed both OLS and Tobit models to test the hypotheses.Findings - A conventional wisdom can argue that MNC subsidiaries are more willing to give charitable donations than local firms do because they may perceive philanthropy in the host country is a good opportunity to reduce liabilities of foreignness (H1-1). On the other hand, one can argue that MNC subsidiaries are less willing to give charitable donations than local firms do because they have operational flexibility when they are coerced to engage in corporate philanthropy by host country government stakeholders (H1-2). Empirical results support the prediction that MNC subsidiaries are less likely to give charitable donations than local firms do in Korea.Research implications or Originality - Our findings can provide useful insights to researchers and managers in the sense that MNC managers can increase or decrease their charitable donations depending on the institutional contingencies in different host countries. These institutional contingencies are particularly important within a transforming context such as Korea."

The photocatalytic activityof various ZnO/CSW photocatalysts was evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) under simulatedsunlight irradiation. The results showed that various ZnO/CSW photocatalysts exhibited much higher photocatalyticactivity than pure ZnO and CSW. Among various ZnO/CSW photocatalysts, the photocatlytic activity of ZnO/CSW increased as increasing the ZnO loading amount from 1.2% to 8.7%, but decreased when the ZnO loadingamount was beyond 8.7% due to the increasing crystalline size of ZnO and recombination of photogenerated hole/electronpairs. Besides ZnO loading amount, MB initial concentration and the dosage of photocatalyst also had significantinfluence on MB degradation rate, and MB degradation rate over ZnO/CSW reached 95.4% under optimum conditions.Kinetics study revealed that the photocatalytic degradation of MB over ZnO/CSW can be described by thepseudo-first-order kinetic model, and the apparent rate constant k versus ZnO loading amount L, MB initial concentrationC0 and the dosage of photocatalyst D can be described as: k=0.5237L0.5193C00.3074D0.4589."

Fault-tolerant control system for once-through steam generator based on reinforcement learning algorithm,2022,"['Once-through steam generator', 'Reinforcement learning', 'DQN algorithm', 'Incremental action']",,"Based on the Deep Q-Network(DQN) algorithm of reinforcement learning, an active fault-tolerance method with incremental action is proposed for the control system with sensor faults of the oncethrough steam generator(OTSG). In this paper, we first establish the OTSG model as the interaction environment for the agent of reinforcement learning. The reinforcement learning agent chooses an action according to the system state obtained by the pressure sensor, the incremental action can gradually approach the optimal strategy for the current fault, and then the agent updates the network by different rewards obtained in the interaction process. In this way, we can transform the active fault tolerant control process of the OTSG to the reinforcement learning agent's decision-making process. The comparison experiments compared with the traditional reinforcement learning algorithm(RL) with fixed strategies show that the active fault-tolerant controller designed in this paper can accurately and rapidly control under sensor faults so that the pressure of the OTSG can be stabilized near the set-point value, and the OTSG can run normally and stably"

And second, in order to explain dehumanization caused by the camp, we used the public sphere among Arendt's concepts. The public domain is a forum where unique personalities form relationships. The city of COVID-19 has restricted and reduced these public spaces by transforming cities into concentration camps. In order to overcome this limitation and the narrowing of public space, we need Arendt's spirit of responsibility, forgiveness, and promise.

Although Western churches and Korean churches. which have experienced digital transformation amidst 4th industrial revolution and COVID-19 pandemic, consider metaverse as the future of Christian ministry, researches on metaverse preaching have only begun. The only precedent research of metaverse preaching in Korea introduced concepts and kinds of metaverse on a basic level and proposed a couple of possible models for metaverse preaching in tandem with the types of metaverse. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and evaluate how metaverse’s characteristics would impact preaching more specifically.As a result of the analysis of the media characteristics of metaverse with recognition of such a need, the author shows that metaverse provides the field where users can have action experiences autonomously and it enables to construct user-oriented digital storytelling experience in metaverse. Based on this understanding, the researcher analyzes the examples of metaverse preaching that were performed in Western churches and Korean churches. They include metaverse preaching at Church of Fools in UK, Life Church, Cornerstone Church of Yuba City, VR Church in US, and metaverse preaching in Korean churches. Particulary, the researcher shows that the metaverse preaching at VR Church takes a form of digital storytelling by using metaverse space and that it fits to the listener-oriented sermon and hearer’s experience of homiletical journey, which contemporary homileticians have claimed as elements of a desirable model of preaching. In addition, the author points out the possibilities and limits of this model and argues that Korean churches should make critical reflections on what metaverse preaching would fruit in interaction with Korean culture."
The Parametric Fashion Design Using Grasshopper -Focused on Skirt Silhouette-,2022,"['fashion design process', 'generative design', 'Grasshopper', 'parametric design', 'parametric design thinking (PDT)']",,"The purpose of this study is to explore a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of skirt shape concepts by manipulating circumferences and lengths via parametric design in the fashion design concept stage. This study also intends to propose a modeling method that can judge and transform the shape through immediate parameter adjustment. We looked at cases that utilized parametric design in other fields of fashion design, reviewed and analyzed the variables used in each study, and constructed parameters suitable to implement skirt fashion design. The traditional design elements required for skirt design, namely waist and hip circumferences, were set as variables in this study. The parametric design was developed to generate ideas of two skirt silhouettes (tight and flared) and three lengths (mini, knee-length, and maxi). To apply the skirt design implemented through variables to the actual 3D human shape, the shape data of women in their 20s and 30s were randomly selected from the 5th human data of Size Korea. Skirt design silhouette modeling was performed by adjusting the variable values according to body type. Parametric design has the potential to help develop design ideas in the field of fashion design, considering the method and characteristics of parameters of the variety of variables and rapid modification. Furthermore, if systematic research on variables and options among fashion design elements is conducted, the possibility of converging them into customization or co-design fashion design processes could be confirmed."

These quantum structures were preparedwith the help of Benzonitrile solvent using Liquid Phase Exfoliation and solvothermal-assistedLiquid Phase Exfoliation, respectively. On one hand, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy shows nosign of phosphorus oxidation in both phosphorene and black phosphorus quantum dots solutions.Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy showed a shift in B2gandA2gphonon modes for phosphorene and blackphosphorus quantum dots as compared to bulk black phosphorus. On the other hand, structural characterizationvia high-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging and electron diffraction patternsshowed a high degree of crystallinity in both quantum structures with no sign of aggregations. Opticalproperties characterization showed the expected increase in the bandgap value for both quantum structures,which were supported by theoretical calculations using density functional theory and effectivemass approximation. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the quantum confinement observed in phosphoreneis weakened to the expected extent, relative to that in BPQDs, by the loss of two confinement dimensions.Appropriate models, describing the bandgap and effective mass dependence as a function of theconfinement regime, are presented."

To evaluate the quality of tea extract, rapid estimation of the antioxidant activity of tea extract is essential. This study proposed Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-NIR) combined with partial least squares (PLS) regression to estimate antioxidant activities as a new quality control technique measure. Total polyphenol content (TPC), DPPH radical scavenging activity (DPPH), and ABTS radical scavenging (ABTS) activity were measured as antioxidant activity potential. To increase the accuracy of the PLS model, the NIR spectrum is preprocessed using the standard normal variate (SNV) and multiplicative scattering correction (MSC) methods. The best calibration model accuracy is obtained using the MSC preprocessed spectrum. The RC2 values of the TPC, DPPH, and ABTS were 0.6789, 0.7973, and 0.7551, respectively. These results of the MSC preprocessed spectrum indicated that the antioxidant activities of bamboo leave extracts could be estimated using PLS models and FT-NIR detection."
CV Driven Resyllabification of Personal Names in Ẹdo,2022,"['Ẹdo', 'personal name', 'syllable', 'resyllabification', 'CV phonology']",,"Nouns in the Ẹdo language have been analysed as obligatorily beginning with a vowel. This paper examines personal names as one instance in which that previously conclusive assumption is violated. The synchronic data analysed in this study show that personal names are freely transformed in such a way that they are used with word initial consonants. The study considers this phenomenon as a resyllabification process that seeks to modify personal names to a CVCV syllable pattern. The study analysed personal names that were collected from Ẹdo speakers across the three local government areas that make up Benin city, the capital of Edo state, Nigeria. The study relies on the principles of the CV-phonology model that began in Clements & Keyser and finds that many Ẹdo personal names are functional with or without the word-initial vowels, a re-syllabified name may become meaningless, have adjusted meaning or retain its original meaning. The paper concludes that resyllabification in multi-syllabic personal names is gradual and the overall goal is to reduce them to CVCV syllable patterns."
Three-dimensional human activity recognition by forming a movement polygon using posture skeletal data from depth sensor,2022,"['feature representation', 'human action and activity recognition', 'Kinect sensor', 'trajectory']",,"Human activity recognition in real time is a challenging task. Recently, a plethora of studies has been proposed using deep learning architectures. The implementation of these architectures requires the high computing power of the machine and a massive database. However, handcrafted features-based machine learning models need less computing power and very accurate where features are effectively extracted. In this study, we propose a handcrafted model based on three-dimensional sequential skeleton data. The human body skeleton movement over a frame is computed through joint positions in a frame. The joints of these skeletal frames are projected into two-dimensional space, forming a “movement polygon.” These polygons are further transformed into a one-dimensional space by computing amplitudes at different angles from the centroid of polygons. The feature vector is formed by the sampling of these amplitudes at different angles. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using a support vector machine on four public datasets: MSR Action3D, Berkeley MHAD, TST Fall Detection, and NTU-RGB+D, and the highest accuracies achieved on these datasets are 94.13%, 93.34%, 95.7%, and 86.8%, respectively. These accuracies are compared with similar state-of-the-art and show superior performance."
Role of Hypothalamic Reactive Astrocytes in Diet-Induced Obesity,2022,"['gliotransmitter', 'high-fat diet', 'hypothalamus', 'obesity', 'reactive astrocytes']",,"Hypothalamus is a brain region that controls food intake and energy expenditure while sensing signals that convey information about energy status. Within the hypothalamus, molecularly and functionally distinct neurons work in concert under physiological conditions. However, under pathological conditions such as in diet-induced obesity (DIO) model, these neurons show dysfunctional firing patterns and distorted regulation by neurotransmitters and neurohormones. Concurrently, resident glial cells including astrocytes dramatically transform into reactive states. In particular, it has been reported that reactive astrogliosis is observed in the hypothalamus, along with various neuroinflammatory signals. However, how the reactive astrocytes control and modulate DIO by influencing neighboring neurons is not well understood. Recently, new lines of evidence have emerged indicating that these reactive astrocytes directly contribute to the pathology of obesity by synthesizing and tonically releasing the major inhibitory transmitter GABA. The released GABA strongly inhibits the neighboring neurons that control energy expenditure. These surprising findings shed light on the interplay between reactive astrocytes and neighboring neurons in the hypothalamus. This review summarizes recent discoveries related to the functions of hypothalamic reactive astrocytes in obesity and raises new potential therapeutic targets against obesity."

Inverse system optimal control of interleaved boost converters,2022,"['Interleaved boost converter', 'Inverse system theory', 'Optimal control', 'Constant power load']",,"When compared with the conventional boost converter, the interleaved boost converter (IBC) has the advantages of low current stress. Thus, they have been widely used in DC microgrids. However, the IBC is a multiple input single output (MISO) high-order nonlinear system. To simplify the controller design, a reduced order model of an interleaved boost converter is proposed in this paper. By selecting an appropriate output function, the nonlinear reduced order system is transformed into a pseudo-linear system through the inverse system theory. Then an optimal controller is designed based on the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory. As a result, the output voltage can track the reference value. In addition, a current balance controller is designed to balance the interphase inductor current. Simulation results of a 3-phase IBC show that when compared with PI control, the proposed control strategy has better regulation performance. Finally, the correctness and eff ectiveness of the proposed control strategy are further verifi ed by experiment on 2-phase IBC."

Various audio-visual experiences can be brought by adapting popular network novels into films, which are not available in network novels. The readership of the network novel can also be transformed into the audience of the movie, thus increasing the box office of the movie. Moreover, the movie can also promote the publication and sales of the network novel, so that the network novel can be spread secondarily and expand its influence. The network novel’s film adaptation refers to the process of adapting the network novel into a screenplay and then making it into a film. Unlike traditional novel adaptations, network novel adaptations are movies or network blockbusters that are broadcast on TV platforms, in cinemas and online. Currently, the main methods of adapting network novels to the film are reproduction adaptation and rewriting adaptation.The network novel was first adapted into a movie in 2000 and has been around for almost 21 years now. The development process of a network novel’s film adaptation is mainly divided into the exploratory, the development and the prosperity. There are 132 movies adapted from network novels that have been shown in cinemas and on mainstream online platforms from 2000 to 2021. The network novel film adaptation model has been formed and gradually improved as the three Internet giants Baidu, iQIYI and Youku join the film industry, and occupy a place in the U.S. market.As the market for film adaptations of network novels continues to expand, a number of problems have emerged along with it. Firstly, There are problems with the creation of network novels. Secondly, there are problems with the process of film adaptation of network novels. Finally, There are problems with filmmaking. The corresponding countermeasures to improve these problems are: first, countermeasures related to network novels, including improving the quality of network novels, improving the literary quality of network writers, and protecting the copyright of network writers. Second, film adaptation-related countermeasures, including the need for film teams to explore novel film adaptation themes, consider the relationship between business and art when adapting films, and coordinate the relationship between literature and audiovisuals. Third, countermeasures related to film production, including directors and filmmakers need to control the quality and quantity of films, conduct market research, actively involve audiences in film production, and establish alliances between network novels and films. In the context of the rapid development of network novel websites and the increasing number of popular and richly-themed network novels being adapted into movies or network movies, this paper has the practical significance of research and the value of continuing in-depth research."

A study of female space in Miwa Komatsu's works,2022,"['female painting', 'feminine space', 'Miwa Komatsu', 'spatial relevance', 'aesthetic activities', '여성회화', '여성공간', '고마츠미우(Miwa Komatsu)', '공간관련성', '심미활동']",,"Starting from the cognitive perspective, this paper interprets contemporary female art works from the perspective of space as the main research content. It shows that the aesthetic research of female art should pay attention to the individual perception model, and carry out research through the situational space environment. Through the research and cognition of the inner space and outer space of the unique female art, a comprehensive space is formed, the method of space epistemology is established, the single picture space is rethought, and the contemporary female works are reinterpreted from the overall artistic space.“Since the 20th century, under the influence of the feminist movement, scholars began to pay attention to the research on women. Before the 1970s, the research on women mainly tended to be carried out from the Angle of sociology and history. With the development of “new art history” and “new historiography” in the Western academic circle, the 1970s began with the development of the new history of art and history later studies on women gradually penetrated into the field of art history.” The modeling and expression of space has always been an important proposition of art. Space has the characteristics of reconstruction, diversity, ductility and so on, and its meaning will change with the transformation of time and space. With the development of science and technology and the inspiration of contemporary philosophical thoughts, the unknown world is constantly being explored explore, many new space art form created, multi-dimensional space art form more and more applications since the middle of the 20th century by artists, art history research in the following changes: except as and the form of traditional research on the map, began to attach importance to the research of other social factors for the global history of exploration These changes reflect that the academic research on the history of art has shifted from exploring the content and form of images to the external factors related to artistic production demand and other outside space. taking painting research as an example, in the traditional cognition, painting as a space art mainly refers to the form composition in a plane space, and this space is only a static material existence form. However, if we compare this space art with the 20th century since the space theory of contact, we will open a new cognitive dimension, give us a new inspiration , namely the form of our plane space visible to the naked eye is not the whole painting space meaning, it besides we can directly see the line of color shape and structure layout of the paintings inside space to outside, still contain the social history Therefore, female paintings are included in a comprehensive space as a comprehensive space of inside and outside painting to understand female works.What is a “feminine space”? Female space is not the physical boudoir space in the traditional Chinese sense, but represents the sum of all historical social and psychological Spaces. “Female space” becomes women's independent individual “large than life”. “Female space” is a core concept that is clearly put forward by Wu Hung in the 《reinventing Stereotypes: The Twelve Flowers of War and a Dream of red Mansions》, it refers to “a real or imaginary place represented by the cognitive imagination as a woman.” “Feminine space” is a unique art expression of the space of a comprehensive, is a combination of paint inner space and outer space is a space covers two-dimensional picture three-dimensional visual space and the original experience of space and aesthetic space, is a collection of various space and the structural connection, is a kind of integrated study on space, from space perspective and an approach to overall art."

Low Complexity Mode Selection for H.266/VVC Intra Coding,2022,"['Versatile Video Coding', 'Intra coding', 'Rough mode decision', 'Most probable mode', 'Rate distortion optimization']",,"The newest video compression standard, called Versatile Video Coding (H.266/VVC), outperforms its predecessor High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) by up to 50% in the matter of coding performance. The achievement results from the integrating of several sophisticated tools such as 32 extended angular modes for intra coding, advanced partitioning structure, and additional transform selection. However, these tools negatively deliver the computational cost of the VVC Test Model (VTM) in all-intra encoding configuration. The existing fast intra coding algorithms achieve a significant saving in computational time with a comparable rate distortion (RD) performance of VVC plus additional computational complexity. In this paper, we study the original strategy of VVC intra mode decision and analyze the correlation among the sum of absolute transformed differences (SATD) costs of the rough mode decision (RMD) and the RD costs of the rate distortion optimization (RDO) processes. Based on the useful correlations with an effective threshold formulation, we propose a fast intra prediction mode selection for the most time-consuming RDO process by selecting a small candidate set based on the SATD costs and calculating the time-consuming RD costs for only intra prediction modes of the small candidate set without a significant overhead. According to the experimental results, our proposed system can reduce up to 27.38% and on average 21.07% of the computation complexity of VTM version 5.0 with an insignificant quality degradation."

This side information is obtained before writing data into flash memories and incorporated during the encoding stage. We show that flash memories under ICI problem can be transformed into the model of memory with defective cells due to the unique asymmetry property between write (page write) and erase (block erase) operations. Then, the channel coding for memory with defective cells is employed to combat ICI. Simulation results support that the proposed scheme with the ICI side information can effectively improve the decoding failure probability."
Impact of Channel Integration Quality on Customer Engagement in Omni-channel Retailing: The Moderating Effect of Consumer Empowerment,2022,"['Omni-channel Retailing', 'Channel Integration Quality', 'Customer Engagement', 'Consumer Empowerment']",,"Consumers are now no longer satisfied with using a single channel to shop and then desire a smooth and consistent purchasing experience across channels. By integrating different channels and services, an omni-channel strategy allows consumers to choose their preferred channel to complete their shopping tasks. Therefore, large retailers in China have recently been transforming into omni-channel retail formats to secure their competitive advantage. To better implement this strategy and optimize its effectiveness, it is important to understand how consumers respond to the quality of channel integration. Based on social exchange theory (SET), the main purposes of this study are to explore the impact of channel integration quality on consumer engagement in the Chinese omni-channel retailing environment and to further examine whether there is a moderating effect of consumer empowerment on this relationship. To test this research model, we collected data from 330 respondents by conducting an online questionnaire in China. The results indicated that the two dimensions of channel integration (breadth of channel-service choice and transparency of channel-service configuration) positively affected two dimensions of customer engagement (conscious attention and enthusiastic participation), respectively. The findings also show that consumer empowerment only positively moderates the relationship between breadth of channel service choice and conscious attention, whereas it negatively moderates the relationship between transparency of channel-service configuration and conscious attention/enthusiastic participation. Given these results, this study deepens our understanding of the impact of the quality of channel integration on customer engagement in the context of omni-channel retailing in China and sheds light on how retailers can attract consumers with different levels of empowerment."
Auranofin attenuates hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease via NRF2 and NF-κB signaling pathways,2022,"['Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease', 'Hepatic fibrosis', 'Auranofin', 'Antioxidants', 'Lipid accumulation']",,"Background/Aims: We aim to evaluate the effects of auranofin, a known antioxidant, on hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, contributing to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) development in vivo and in vitro.Methods: Transcriptome analysis of LX-2 cells was that expression patterns of genes changed by auranofin, and their related pathways were estimated. We used the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) program to determine the pathway involved in overall genetic change. In vitro, LX-2 and HepG2 cells were treated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and palmitic acid (PA), respectively, and the antifibrotic and antiadipogenic effect function of auranofin was evaluated.Results: Transcriptome analysis revealed that auranofin decreased the expression of 15 genes, including thrombospondin 1, endothelin 1 (ET-1), fibronectin 1, and LOX. The molecular functions of these genes are involved in collagen binding. GSEA of the overall gene expression pattern revealed that many genes increased in the reactive oxygen species pathway and decreased in the inflammatory response. Auranofin decreased nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and IκBα in TGF-β1-induced LX-2 cells, thereby reducing ET-1 and fibrosis. Furthermore, increased pNRF2 in PA-induced HepG2 cells led to increased antioxidant marker expression and decreased lipid accumulation. In the bile duct ligation model mice, auranofin reduced the fibrosis area and increased the survival rate. Auranofin reduced liver fibrosis and lipid accumulation in NASH model mice fed on a Western diet.Conclusions: Auranofin inhibits lipogenesis and fibrosis formation and is a proposed candidate for NASH treatment."

This study meta-analyzed 88 research paper on leadership and followership variables for members of domestic organizations from 2000 to 2021. The major findings are as follows: First, The effect size between the followership and the leadership model was found in the order of authentic leadership, ethical leadership, and servant leadership. Although there were many studies that set the variables of transactional leadership and transformational leadership, the effect size with followership was not high. Second, the leadership component factors with the highest followership and effect size was individual consideration, intellectual stimulation, and ideal influence. Through this, it can be seen that the follower-centered approach is effective for leadership with high followership and effect size. This study has practical significance in that it presents a leadership model and component factors that affect followership by analyzing the effect size as an investigation into the study of leadership and followership variable setting conducted in Korea. In addition, it has academic significance in that it suggests the necessity and implications of a relational view of leadership and followership."
Feasibility of UHPC shields in spent fuel vertical concrete cask to resist accidental drop impact,2022,"['Ultra-high performance concrete', 'Vertical concrete cask', 'Numerical simulation', 'Accidental drop', 'Optimal design']",,"Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) has been widely utilized in military and civil protective structures to resist intensive loadings attributed to its excellent properties, e.g., high tensile/compressive strength, high dynamic toughness and impact resistance. At present, aiming to improve the defects of the traditional vertical concrete cask (VCC), i.e., the external storage facility of spent fuel, with normal strength concrete (NSC) shield, e.g., heavy weight and difficult to fabricate/transform, the feasibility of UHPC applied in the shield of VCC is numerically examined considering its high radiation and corrosion resistance. Firstly, the finite element (FE) analyses approach and material model parameters of NSC and UHPC are verified based on the 1/3 scaled VCC tip-over test and drop hammer test on UHPC members, respectively. Then, the refined FE model of prototypical VCC is established and utilized to examine its dynamic behaviors and damage distribution in accidental tip-over and end-drop events, in which the various influential factors, e.g., UHPC shield thickness, concrete ground thickness, and sealing methods of steel container are considered. In conclusion, by quantitatively evaluating the safety of VCC in terms of the shield damage and vibrations, it is found that adopting the 300 mm-thick UHPC shield instead of the conventional 650 mm-thick NSC shield can reduce about 1/3 of the total weight of VCC, i.e., about 50 t, and 37% floor space, as well as guarantee the structural integrity of VCC during the accidental drop simultaneously. Besides, based on the parametric analyses, the thickness of concrete ground in the VCC storage site is recommended as less than 500 mm, and the welded connection is recommended for the sealing method of steel containers"

To improve the dynamic and steady performance of the linear servo system, the feedback linearization control method is adopted in this paper. By coordinate transformation and state feedback, the affi ne nonlinear model of the motor is decoupled and linearized into an independent current subsystem and linear velocity subsystem. Based on the linearization model, a dynamic sliding mode controller is designed to reduce the dependence of feedback linearization control on the mathematical model of PMLSM and improve the robustness of the servo system.

Fundamentals and machine learning in forecast of won-dollar exchange rate,2022,"['exchange rate forecast', 'machine learning', 'long short-term memory', 'empirical mode decomposition']",,"There are two issues in exchange rate forecast. One is the low explanatory power of economic fundamentals for high frequency exchange rate. The other is the usefulness of machine learning for exchange rate prediction. This paper tries to reconcile those issues by trying to use fundamentals to predict daily exchange rate with machine learning. To match monthly frequency fundamentals with daily exchange rate, linear interpolation is used to transform monthly data to daily. To reduce the noise, daily exchange rates are decomposed to trend and cyclical components using empirical model decomposition (EMD). Regression of trend part of exchange rate on fundamental variables show that the macroeconomic fundamentals have some explanatory power for daily exchange rate. For the forecast, long short-term memory (LSTM) of recurrent neural network (RNN) is applied to trend and cycle part separately. Based on the regression result, fundamental variables are used as input features of LSTM of trend component. Lagged variables are used for LSTM of cyclical part.Forecasts from the two LSTM models are added to get predictors of exchange rate. Results show that trend-cycle LSTM forecasts are better than the traditional random walk predictors."

Deep learning (DL) method which is attracting widespread interest has proven to be an efficient approach to measure the similarity between image pairs in quick and accurate manner by extracting complex and detailed features from satellite images. However, Image matching of VHR satellite images remains challenging due to limitations of DL models in which the results are depending on the quantity and quality of training dataset, as well as the difficulty of creating training dataset with VHR satellite images. Therefore, this study examines the feasibility of DL-based method in matching pair extraction which is the most time-consuming process during image registration. This paper also aims to analyze factors that affect the accuracy based on the configuration of training dataset, when developing training dataset from existing multi-sensor VHR image database with bias for DL-based image matching. For this purpose, the generated training dataset were composed of correct matching pairs and incorrect matching pairs by assigning true and false labels to image pairs extracted using a grid-based Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for a total of 12 multi-temporal and multi-sensor VHR images. The Siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN), proposed for matching pair extraction on constructed training dataset, proceeds with model learning and measures similarities by passing two images in parallel to the two identical convolutional neural network structures. The results from this study confirm that data acquired from VHR satellite image database can be used as DL training dataset and indicate the potential to improve efficiency of the matching process by appropriate configuration of multi-sensor images. DL-based image matching techniques using multi-sensor VHR satellite images are expected to replace existing manual-based feature extraction methods based on its stable performance, thus further develop into an integrated DL-based image registration framework."

But it is difficult to apply to high dimensional data due to the sparseness of the data and the limitation of the total number of attributes that can be selected for node partitioning. In this paper, we propose a dimension reduction method for unsupervised outlier detection in high dimensional data. Dimension reduction is performed by linear transformation maximizing kurtosis, and in the transformed space, outlier detection by Isolation Forest is applied. Kurtosis is a statistical measure that can be interpreted as the degree of the presence of outliers in the distribution. A linear transformation is found by using a simple one-layer neural network where a subset of features having the highest kurtosis is used as input features and an objective function, which maximizes kurtosis in output nodes, is set. The experimental results using text data demonstrated the high detection performance of Isolation Forest modeled in the space transformed by the proposed dimension reduction method"

In this method, a Gaussian process model is implemented as a dynamic transformation model of the system, and energy loss term is added to cost function. By learning the optimal impedance regulation strategy, a balance could be achieved between error and energy. With reinforcement learning, the input state is changed to the average value over a time period to reduce signal interference and improve data efficiency. The results show that the learning-based variable impedance control method is efficient and can help complete position/force control tasks successfully with only a few interactions, thus significantly reducing the interaction time."

Second, the precise linearized high-order system of SVG was transformed into two completely independent decoupled fi rst-order linear systems, and realize complete decoupling of active current and reactive current. Finally, SMC was used to design both the voltage outer loop and the current inner loop. Simulations ware carried out for the SVG mathematical model under three conditions which were inductive load, capacitive load and sudden change load. The results of those simulation showed that the controller designed by the proposed control strategy has the advantages of quick reactive power compensation, strong robustness and anti-interference performance."
Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Subsequent Acute Pulmonary Inflammatory Response,2022,['Traumatic brain injury · Acute lung injury · Inflammation'],,"Objective : The influence of moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) on acute pulmonary injury is well established, but the association between acute pulmonary injury and mild TBI has not been well studied. Here, we evaluated the histological changes and fluctuations in inflammatory markers in the lungs to determine whether an acute pulmonary inflammatory response occurred after mild TBI.Methods : Mouse models of mild TBI (n=24) were induced via open-head injuries using a stereotaxic impactor. The brain and lungs were examined 6, 24, and 72 hours after injury and compared to sham-operated controls (n=24). Fluoro-Jade B staining and Astra blue and hematoxylin staining were performed to assess cerebral neuronal degeneration and pulmonary histological architecture.Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was done to measure inflammatory cytokines.Results : Increased neuronal degeneration and the mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β were observed after mild TBI. The IL-6, TNF-α, and TGF-β levels in mice with mild TBI were significantly different compared to those of sham-operated mice 24 hours after injury, and this was more pronounced at 72 hours. Mild TBI induced acute pulmonary interstitial edema with cell infiltration and alveolar morphological changes. In particular, a significant infiltration of mast cells was observed. Among the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α was significantly increased in the lungs at 6 hours, but there was no significant difference 24 and 72 hours after injury.Conclusion : Mild TBI induced acute pulmonary interstitial inflammation and alveolar structural changes, which are likely to worsen the patient’s prognosis."

For these, it analyzed three typical writing textbooks being used in colleges and examined the ways of presentation on forming integrated knowledge by text qualitative analysis methods. The analysis procedure and the presentation followed Creswell’s spiral analysis model It is a method model which repeats the procedure from material collection and analysis to presentation circularly. This examination illustrates three dimensions of the units in forming content knowledge. Also, it suggested those should be all treated for the more systematic education: the units of the whole text, the paragraphs, and the sentences. In the next chapter, the standards and contents of knowledge integration were suggested in each process. For the process of knowledge selection, the suitability and the contradictoriness between the text materials and author’s thesis were proposed as the standards and contents. For the process of organization and integration, the corresponsive integration, contradictive integration, background integration, synthetic integration were suggested. Finally the procedure knowledge such as correct expression and spelling, source indication were shown for the process of expression and citation.  Furthermore, it showed, in terms of expression, the process of paraphrasing frequently practiced in writing textbooks needs to be exercised in the three dimensions including summarization, connection, and interpretation(or transformation). This result, however, calls for the further study about the subdividing processes to enhance the adequateness to writing textbooks in the level of universities and for a more refined syllabus on the systematic knowledge integration. Accordingly, it suggested the tasks mentioned above for further study."
The Impact of Fasciation on Maize Inflorescence Architecture,2022,"['Maize', 'Inflorescence architecture', 'Fasciation', 'Crop yields']",,"How functional genetics research can be applied to improving crop yields is a timely challenge. One of the most direct methods is to produce larger inflorescences with higher productivity, which should be accompanied by a balance between stem cell proliferation and lateral organ initiation in meristems. Unbalanced proliferation of stem cells causes the fasciated inflorescences, which reflect the abnormal proliferation of meristems, derived from the Latin word ‘fascis’, meaning ‘bundle’. Maize, a model system for grain crops, has shown tremendous yield improvements through the mysterious transformation of the female inflorescence during domestication. In this review, we focus on maize inflorescence architecture and highlight the patterns of fasciation, including recent progress."

This research aims two main contributions. First, we analyze the relationship between the Capesize used ship, which is a typical type in the raw material transportation market, and the freight market, for which mixed empirical analysis results are presented. Second, we present an empirical analysis model that considers the structural transformation proposed in the Hyunsok Kim and Myung-hee Chang(2020a) study in quantile-regression. In structural change investigations, the empirical results confirm that the quantile model is able to overcome the problems caused by nonstationarity in time series analysis. Then, the long-run relationship of the co-integration framework divided into long and short-run effects of exogenous variables, and this is extended to a prediction model subdivided by quantile. The results are the basis for extending the analysis based on the shipping theory to artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches."
Particulate Reinforcements in Dicyanate Composites with Nanoporous Aluminum Fumarate as Reactive Filler: Thermal Properties,2022,"['particle reinforcement', 'high-temperature properties', 'thermal analysis', 'hybrid nanocomposite.']",,"In this work, the synthesized nanoporous aluminum fumarate (Al_FA_A) metal organic framework (MOF) hasbeen used as reactive filler for the bisphenol-A dicyanate (BADCy) resin system. The use of Al_FA_A is interesting dueto the involvement of double bonds (fumarate) in triazine during polymerization. The thermal properties of the polymersformed with and without reactive filler were evaluated under different curing temperatures, prepolymerizations and postpolymerizations conditions. All the samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) andEvolved gas analysis. On the contrary, the cure chemistry was determined by non-isothermal model free kinetic methods.This study provides a new path to utilize the MOFs as reactive nanoparticle fillers to obtain multifunctional materials."

Cell proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) expression were induced by heptapeptide. The reduced cell viability under photoaging condition through ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation was increased by heptapeptide. And UVA-induced apoptosis, matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MMP-1) expression, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level were decreased by heptapeptide. In addition, the inhibition of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/smad signaling under UVA irradiation which resulting in reduction of ECM expression was also recovered by heptapeptide. We also tested the effect of heptapeptide under another photoaging condition through heat shock, and pre-treatment of heptapeptide prevented the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and MMP-1 expression induced by heat shock.From these results, it has been shown that the heptapeptide has protective effects on fibroblasts through the up-regulation of cellular activity and through the decreasing of intracellular ROS level induced by UVA irradiation or heat shock. It is expected that the dermal protection effect of heptapeptide can be applied as a new cosmetic material in the future."

Given the premise that encryption is used as a means of de-identification, there is no question that it is difficult or difficult to identify information, but various views are possible on the result.From the perspective of a business that implements a blockchain-based service model, there is room for recognizing encrypted information as anonymous information and determining that it is not subject to protection under the Personal Information Protection Act. However, in view of the flow of technological development, perfect encryption cannot exist, and when performing forensic work using additional information, there is room for backtracking the original information before encryption. In other words, it cannot be regarded as anonymous information that cannot be re-identified.This paper intends to examine what encryption information on the block is, focusing on the recent blockchain-based distributed identity authentication service. And based on the results of the review, we would like to present an independent opinion that, among the encrypted information, the issuance of qualification verification information is not personal information under the Personal Information Protection Act, and the DID and public key are identifiable information and not pseudonymous information. In reality, while the flow of digital transformation is accelerating and new technologies such as block chain are developing, there is a gap with these technological developments in the discussions within the law, such as the Personal Information Protection Act. It is a situation where the problem must be solved in a form that seeks specific validity by the interpretation of academia or judges for each case.Although the technology-neutral viewpoint of the provisions of the law is valid, it is necessary to specify standards to avoid arbitrary judgment of judges in subordinate statutes or guidelines. Looking at the issues that need to be supplemented, ① whether public key encryption, a block chain technology, can be viewed as pseudonymous processing, or ② whether the process of decrypting encrypted information using an encryption key and re-identification through the combination of additional information of pseudonymous information is considered the same?, ③ It concludes with a discussion of the distinction between ‘other information’ when reviewing identifiable information and ‘additional information’ for re-identification potential when processing pseudonyms. Legal rights that can be linked to new technologies, such as the Personal Information Protection Act, need to be adjusted in accordance with the flow of technological development. By clarifying the relevant standards in the guidelines, it is reasonable to secure predictability for blockchain-based service providers and at the same time safely protect the personal information of the service users."

If the normal message patterns displayed on the VMS system are learned, it would be possible to detect and respond to the anomalous messages quickly. This paper proposes a method for detecting anomalous messages by learning the normal patterns of messages using a bi-directional generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) network. In particular, the proposed method was trained using the normal messages and their system parameters to minimize the corresponding negative log-likelihood (NLL) values. After adequate training, the proposed method could detect an anomalous message when its NLL value was larger than a pre-specified threshold value. The experiment results showed that the proposed method could detect malicious messages and cases when the system error occurs."

A Privacy-preserving and Energy-efficient Offloading Algorithm based on Lyapunov Optimization,2022,"['Mobile edge computing', 'Computing offloading', 'Usage pattern', 'Privacy protection', 'Lyapunov optimization']",,"In Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), attackers can speculate and mine sensitive user information by eavesdropping wireless channel status and offloading usage pattern, leading to user privacy leakage. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Privacy-preserving and Energy-efficient Offloading Algorithm (PEOA) based on Lyapunov optimization. In this method, a continuous Markov process offloading model with a buffer queue strategy is built first. Then the amount of privacy of offloading usage pattern in wireless channel is defined. Finally, by introducing the Lyapunov optimization, the problem of minimum average energy consumption in continuous state transition process with privacy constraints in the infinite time domain is transformed into the minimum value problem of each timeslot, which reduces the complexity of algorithms and helps obtain the optimal solution while maintaining low energy consumption. The experimental results show that, compared with other methods, PEOA can maintain the amount of privacy accumulation in the system near zero, while sustaining low average energy consumption costs. This makes it difficult for attackers to infer sensitive user information through offloading usage patterns, thus effectively protecting user privacy and safety."

To this end, the concept of narrative was first examined, and it was derived that narrative competence and language were closely related. Chomsky’s theory(Language Acquisition Device, Transformational generative grammar), Bakhtin’s Dialogic theory and Bruner’s Language Acquisition Assistant System, which synthesizes them, were considered. Bruner accepted both the innate and interactive perspectives of language, and in connection with the narrative, explained the occurrence of narratives with an endogenous approach and plight-modeling approach, and proposed thought mode of narrative as a concept contrasting with the thought mode of paradigm. Based on Bruner's narrative theory and the lexical meaning of care, the concept of narrative care as ‘educational care’ and ‘educational management’ was presented. In order to implement narrative care for elementary school students, whose cognitive, affective, and physical development is the most prominent, the role of elementary school teachers is a ‘The observer of classroom narrative’ based on educational care, ‘The operator of narrative curriculum of classroom’ based on educational management, and ‘The narrative inquirer on classroom’ who conducts a narrative inquiry consisting of reflection and practice, is presented so that care and management can work well."
"Isolation, characterization and methylene blue adsorption: Application of cellulose from olive sawdust",2022,"['Olive Sawdust', 'Alkaline Treatment', 'Cellulose', 'Crystalline Structure', 'Organic Dyes', 'Absorption']",,"This research work is based on the isolation of cellulosic fibers from Tunisian olive sawdust (TOS) by alkaline treatment using a solution of NaOH at different concentrations: 5% w/v (TOS5) and 20% w/v (TOS20). The valorization of these cellulosic supports was assessed by the adsorption ability of methylene blue (MB), chosen as a model compound of organic dyes. SEM and FTIR analyses have shown that alkaline treatment produces a delignification of TOS and an elimination of hemicellulose. A transformation of cellulose I to cellulose II was shown by XRD following the decrease of the crystallinity indices passing from TOS5 (~37%) to TOS20 (~30%). The spectroscopic study confirmed that the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds have a primordial role in the forms and the structural stability of the cellulosic substrates. Thereby, the deconvolution of OH stretching vibration band confirmed the transition from cellulose I to cellulose II by the occurrence of a new band at 3,080 cm1 for TOS20. The increase of iodine adsorption values (ISV) from 40 mg·g1 for TOS5 to 65mg·g1 for TOS20 is behind the improvement of the accessibility of cellulosic support with alkaline treatment of TOS. The adsorption of MB onto the surface of cellulosic substrates in aqueous mixtures was studied quantitatively. The corresponding isotherms in basic medium have shown the formation of a monolayer following the Langmuir model characterized by 14mg·g1, 52 mg·g1 and 76 mg·g1 onto the TOS, TOS5 and TOS20, respectively. The desorption efficiency of MB in acid medium increased with 37%, 57% and 71% for TOS, TOS5 and TOS20, respectively. Hence, the extracted cellulosic fibers are likely to be a promising adsorbent for the removal of organic dye from aqueous solutions."

Among the 5 different candidate antibodies, appropriate antibody could be sorted out within 30 minutes through rBSM. In addition, selected antibodies were applied to two representative LFIA based techniques, sandwich assay and competitive assay. Among these methods, sandwich assay showed more effective VLP detection method. Through applying selected antibodies and techniques to the commercialized mass production lines, an VLP detecting LFIA kit was developed with a detection limit of 1012 copies/g of VLPs in real samples. Since this proposed method in this study could be easily transformable into other combinations with bioreceptors, it is expected that this technique would be applied to LFIA kit development system and bioreceptor quality management."

For this purpose, the main research contents include the meaning of master plot analysis of self-narrative, the method of implosion or transformation of master plot through analysis, and the preparation of steps for creation of novel writing education using this. Literature research and meta-analysis were used as research methods, including Abbott's discussion of the master plot concept, literature research on plot-related discourse, meta-analysis of literary therapy studies related to self-description, and analysis of Center for Story-based Strategy(CSS). The research process is as follows. First, a master plot utilization model of self-narrative was derived through literature study and meta-analysis on the self-narrative concept and narrative transformation strategy program in literature therapy. As a result, the stages of novel writing using the master plot of self-narrative were prepared as follows. First, 'to effectively collide with the catalytic narrative', second, 'to find the voices of the master plot', and third, 'to find the starting point and to reconstruct the counter plot'. The first step consists of three steps: 'Selecting a Catalyst Narrative', 'Listening to a Catalyst Narrative and Forming a Response', and 'Deinterpreting the Reaction's Attribution and Meta-Interpretation. The second step consists of three steps: ‘Rhetoric Analysis of master plots’, ‘Archeological Analysis of master plots’, and ‘Network analysis of master plots’. The third step also consists of three steps: ‘Finding the starting point of the master plot and positioning the intervention’, ‘Transforming the plot at the intervention point’, and ‘Creating and sharing a counter plot’. Through the above research, it was intended to revitalize novel writing in terms of creative education and to heal through renewal of self-narrative in terms of literary therapy. This is because rewriting self-narrative is a work that secures narrative identity as the owner of the narrative that drives life, and through this, seeks to become a master of a more mature life and creator of the narrative."
Development of real time responding hydrogen fueling protocol and its risk assessment,2022,"['Hydrogen Fueling Protocol', 'Hydrogen Refueling Station', 'Compressed Hydrogen Storage System', 'Average Pressure Ramp Rate', 'Real-time Responding HFP']",,"Existing hydrogen fueling protocols (HFP), such as SAE J2601, have limitations in low efficiency and limited applicability for various vehicle types. They use lookup tables or formulas constructed by simulation and do not calculate the optimal fueling strategy in real-time. To address this issue, we proposed a real-time responding HFP (RTR-HFP) in our previous study and further improved the RTR-HFP in this study. We introduced a tuning parameter to transform the simplified model from the extreme case to the real case, and we can determine a less conservative pressure ramp rate (PRR) by RTR-HFP in real-time. In addition, to avoid unstable fueling issues when the storage system pressure is too low, we integrated the RTR-HFP with the existing table-based strategy and determined the best PRR while restricting the upper bound on PRR. Furthermore, we performed a risk assessment of the fueling system and found a solution to ensure the safety integrity level in the control system."

Speed Sensorless Control of Bearingless Induction Motors Based on Adaptive Flux Observer,2022,"['Bearingless induction motor', 'Adaptive flux observer', 'Sensorless', 'Suspension performance']",,"To realize the speed self-identifi cation of the suspension rotor in the low-cost operation control of a bearingless induction motor (BIM), a speed sensorless control strategy based on the adaptive fl ux observer is proposed. Firstly, the stability condition of the observer is analyzed by the small-signal linearization method, and the output errors of the observer in two stationary coordinate systems are transformed into the rotor magnetic fi eld rotating coordinate, and condition of the error feedback matrix satisfying the observer stability is obtained. Secondly, based on the construction of the full-order model of the controlled object, a feedback loop containing the measured object and its variable is designed, and a reduced-order speed observer is constructed to realize the speed self-identifi cation of the BIM. Finally, simulation and experimental verifi cation research are carried out on the BIM speed sensorless vector control system. Both simulation and experiment results show that the proposed speed self-identifi cation method can not only realize speed sensorless operation under no-load, speed change, an abrupt change of load eff ectively, but also make the motor has a good suspension performance."
Improving colorization through denoiser with MLP,2022,"['Colorization', 'Color constancy', 'GAN', 'Pix2pix', 'Back propagation']",,"Colorizing black and white photos and movies enhances the old versions, and make them more interesting to see. Therefore, we became interested in image colorization, which plays an essential role in the field of computer vision. Recently, deep learning techniques for image colorization have progressed remarkably. In this study, colorization is carried out using a novel deep learning model for vivid coloring. The model consists of two components: Pix2Pix as a generative adversarial network (GAN), and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) of a denoiser. The Pix2Pix primarily generates the color image for a given grayscale image as input, and the MLP transforms the colored image into a vivid color image by filtering out noise. In our experiments, the grayscale images used as input images were images of natural objects and artifacts. We observed that the predicted images provided as output images were more neatly colored through the proposed method."

The linear economy model, which takes resources, manufactures products, and discards them, has led to unsustainable consumption of resources and energy. It can be said that the core of the discussion on the circular economy is to start from the recognition that excessive consumption of resources is the root cause of all environmental problems and to shift to an economic structure that minimizes the use of resources and energy by increasing the circulation of resources. Therefore, the transition to a circular economy can be said to be a solution to all environmental problems, such as climate change, environmental pollution, and biodiversity loss, and a means of implementing sustainable development. The transition to a circular economy goes beyond environmental policy requiring paradigm shift of economy. Korea, which has entered the ranks of advanced countries after a period of high growth, should set sustainability as its number one goal and establish a circular economy as its means. In order to build a circular economy, the transition to a digital economy must be accompanied. A new business model using the 4th industrial revolution technology can maximize the efficiency of resource use and lead to economic development and decoupling of resource use. Korea has long been implementing a resource recycling policy as a part of its waste policy. However, approaching the circular economy in the last stage of resource use has only limited effect. The circular economy should not be approached as a part of waste policy, but rather as a macroscopic industrial policy or economic policy. Basically, the circular economy should aim to eliminate the concept of waste itself. Companies should maximize product safety and durability from the production stage, and design products so that repair, reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing are possible. From the stage of production and consumption before waste is generated, the use of resources should be reduced and the lifespan of the product should be extended to the maximum. To this end, the policy should be expanded from the aspect of waste management to a more proactive aspect. The national procurement system should also induce companies to transform into a circular economy by purchasing goods with a small resource and energy footprint. The transition to a circular economy requires a government-wide response. Since the transition to a circular economy is not a task that can be achieved in a short period of time, policies to promote the transition must be consistently pursued."

To evaluate the severity of psoriasis, the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score have been used in clinical trials and studies. This clinical indicator is subjective, so to overcome these shortcoming, various automatic psoriasis analysis methods based on deep learning have been studied. However, the limited number of data and psoriasis characteristic such as ambiguity of severity deteriorate model performance. One of the simple and powerful methods to overcome these problem is data augmentation. Data augmentation should be used according to data characteristics. Therefore, we analyzed and compared the classification results applied with five data augmentation methods, Geometric transformation, CutMix, Visual Corruptions, AutoAugment, RandAugment, and explored data augmentation method suitable for psoriasis severity classification. We used the EfficientNet B2 for psoriasis severity classification. As a result, when RandAugment or the combination of Geometric transform and Visual Corruptions were used, it showed the best classification performance with an accuracy of 87.5%. In addition, we confirmed the effect of data augmentation for improving model performance and the difference in performance according to single or multiple applications of the data augmentation methods. Through these results, our study can be applied to various studies as a data augmentation method suitable for psoriasis disease image."
Quantitative evaluation method for machining accuracy retention of CNC machine tools considering degenerate trajectory fluctuation,2022,"['Accuracy retention', 'Fluctuation degree', 'Machine tool', 'Quantitative evaluation']",,"Accuracy retention is an important performance index of CNC machine tools. At present, research on the evaluation of machining accuracy retention of CNC machine tools mainly focuses on accuracy value of a fixed time point or different time periods, but studies on the fluctuation degree of degradation trajectory related to time change are limited. Extracting simple and effective degradation characteristics of machining accuracy and then evaluating machining accuracy retention considering fluctuation of degradation trajectory are necessary.The volume error model of CNC machine tools is established on the basis of multibody system theory in this study. Three-dimensional volume error vector is transformed into one-dimensional machining accuracy degradation by calculating offset distance between spatial error and origin points. Degradation data obtained via regular measurement and calculation are used to establish the complete degradation trajectory model of the CNC machine tools machining accuracy using radial basis function interpolation method according to the fluctuation degree of degradation trajectory, and concepts of average degradation rate and average degradation amount are defined. Lastly, examples showed that these two indicators can intuitively reflect fluctuation degree of machining accuracy degradation of CNC machine tools and effectively and quantitatively evaluate accuracy retention of CNC machine tools. The quantitative evaluation method of accuracy retention of CNC machine tools defined in this study considers the fluctuation degree of accuracy degradation trajectory. The quantitative evaluation index of accuracy retention demonstrates satisfactory engineering application because it can reflect not only the accuracy change of a single machine tool but also accurately compare the accuracy retention between different machine tools."

To analyze this, the authors established a creative direction analysis model constituting five elements: brand heritage, trend, democratization, brand status, and persona, drawing on the luxury brand architecture by Kapferer and Bastien. Thus, Galliano has maintained anonymity as a heritage of Maison Margiela, expanding the existing Replica lines, and introduced fashion shows focusing on current issues or social phe- nomena. As a democratization strategy, he directed the brand to associate with more popular brands or expanded dif- fusion lines to secure broader customer base, while demonstrating couturier-like showmanship in the media and establishing his own persona. His direction for Maison Margiela recreates and expands brand heritage by transforming the brand philosophy. Therefore the new creative direction communicates with the wider public and diversifies customer bases through democratization strategies, while building Galliano’s own persona."

A number of studies conducted various analyzes for the purpose of revitalizing export performance in the ASEAN region, and presented strategic suggestions for expanding export performance. In general, the focus is on securing export competitiveness, emphasizing the importance of acquiring various knowledge necessary for local activities. This corresponds to a company's dynamic capabilities and is related to its ability to acquire and utilize diverse local information. Dynamic absorption capacity was divided into explorative learning, exploitative learning, and transformative learning and applied to this study. On the other hand, there are studies that focus on the institutional characteristics of the local market. In general, there are achievements based on cultural distance, and it is argued that local formal and informal institutional characteristics affect business activities. In this study, according to these discussions, an analysis model was established that integrated the knowledge-based perspective and FTA utilization capabilities for SMEs entering CLM. For informal institutional characteristics, GLOBE items were used, and 8 hypotheses were established including the moderating effect of the relevant factors. Hypothesis testing was performed using the structural equation model using PLS. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the factors of dynamic absorption capacity had an overall positive effect on the FTA utilization performance. At the same time, FTA utilization capacity was also having a positive effect on export performance. These results show the importance of FTA utilization capabilities in SMEs' export activities. It also indicates that there is a positive relationship between the dynamic absorption capacity and the FTA utilization capacity.

Conventionalmethods for acne treatment have various side effects such as inflammation, dryness, peeling, cutaneous irritation and scalingof the skin. The novel wound dressing coated with nanoparticles containing drug was fabricated as a drug delivery system foracne treatment. In this present, Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanoparticles containing clindamycin were successfully prepared bythe electrospraying method and coated on the surface of cotton fabric. The final drug loaded nanoparticles were characterizedusing Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD),Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and biodegradation. The increasing clindamycin concentration in electrosprayingsolution led to reverse effects on the viscosity, electrical conductivity and affect on the diameter of nanoparticles. At variousconcentrations of clindamycin, spherical nanoparticles with uniform size were formed from PVA solution. Also, drug releaserate was investigated using both in vitro dissolution and permeation methods during 720 min. Fractional release curvesobtained exhibited short term release of clindamycin within first 60 min and slower release rate until 720 min. The releaserate of clindamycin was higher from PVA nanoparticles containing 10 % W/W drug than those loaded with 5 % W/W drug.Release plots were analyzed based on Korsmeyer-Peppas model, suggesting Fickian diffusion as the dominant clindamycinrelease mechanism from the PVA nanoparticles. Moreover, the drug release profile of PVA nanoparticles coated cotton fabricwas found to be lower than that for the drug loaded nanoparticles. This study suggests wound dressing coated with PVAnanoparticles as a novel drug delivery vehicle for short term administration of clindamycin for treatment of acne scars."

The process of diagnosing bearing faults using machine learning is as follows. First, the features, including the fault characteristic of the vibration signals, are extracted, and these features are selected to reduce the dimension of the features. These features are input into the machine learning classifier to diagnose the system's health. In addition to machine learning methods, CNN, one of the deep learning methods, is widely used.Since the deep learning model extracts features by itself, only the preprocessing process of converting the bearing signals into 2D is needed. The fault classification accuracy of two vibration signal transformation methods as preprocessing methods for the CNN model was compared. This paper compares the bearing fault classification performance of several machine learning commonly used and the CNN model for the lab-made wind turbine machinery testbed. By comparing different feature extraction, feature selection, and classification methods, the most appropriate pipeline is selected for the testbed. Also, grad-cam, an explainable AI(XAI) technique, is applied to interpret the CNN based classification in terms of interested frequency bandwidth. The XAI analysis was verified by designing preprocessing filters based on the grad-cam outputs for enhancing classification performance."

The biggest innovation strategy of the major convenience store brands in recent years are introducing the O2O (Online to Offline) platform and presenting new products and services beyond the boundaries of online and offline to transform themselves into Omni Channel stores. The study is designed to analyze the effect of innovativeness of convenience store as a stimulus in O2O platform which customers perceive on store loyalty, the final response to external stimuli, through customer engagement with convenience store brands. Specifically, the innovativeness of convenience stores was divided into types of core activities in corporate marketing and focused on innovations in services, products(proposals), promotions and experiences. Research design, data, and methodology: Various hypotheses have been developed to achieve this research purpose. The data were collected from 1,128 questionnaires the age between 15 and 60 who had experience using retail store apps and delivery apps and were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 and SmartPLS 3.3.7 program. Measurement model analysis was carried out to assess convergent and discriminant validity. Also, common method bias was tested using the values of VIF (variance inflation factor). The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling with SmartPLS 3.3.7 program. Results: First, service innovation has a positive effect on cognitive engagement. Second, product, promotion and experience innovation have a positive effect on cognitive and affective engagement. Third, cognitive influences affective engagement. Finally, both cognitive and affective engagement affect store loyalty, but affective engagement has a stronger effect on store loyalty than cognitive engagement. Conclusions: All four types of innovation and cognitive engagement have a positive effect on emotional engagement, which has a stronger effect on store loyalty than cognitive engagement. Thus, while innovation can build loyalty through emot ional engagement, innovation strategies must be designed and pursued with caution in terms of impact through cognitive engagement may not achieve the planned goals."

Strauss emphasized that modern man overemphasized reason, and argued that human beings have rather become instruments of reason oppressed by reason.Strauss has diagnosed that modern people are in a state of psychological crisis because they lose the intrinsic innocence of human beings. Accordingly, as Strauss continued to criticize instrumental reason in his works, and to overcome this crisis of modern people, he tried to remember and reproduce the mythical archetype, the fundamental model of human life. In this regard, this study examines the problems of modern society caused by excessive blind faith in Logos through Botho Strauss’s ‘Big and Small’ and ‘The Time and The Room’. In addition, it examines how Mythos, the spiritual source of human beings, which Strauss proposes as an alternative to overcome the problem of reason-centered life, was accepted, transformed, and portrayed.Strauss portrays the way in which the relationship between family and interpersonal relationships of modern people who are captivated by instrumental reason is no longer a relationship of true love or trust, but a relationship that is purposeful and goal-oriented through two works. Also, through the events unfolding in the historical time of this world and the mythical time that is being repeated forever, the ancient harmonious and pure mythical world is presented as an utopia.Strauss emphasized that modern people can overcome the spiritual crisis of modern society by avoiding the rational-centered, purpose-oriented life and by repeating and reproducing the mythical archetype that is the spiritual source and proprietor of man in his works."

Based on this the direction of Korean language education reform for the development of Korean language education in China and the quality change of talent training were suggested. According to the aforementioned policies, it is necessary for Korean language education to transform from language ability-oriented to training compound talents with comprehensive ability and “Korean+expertise”. To cultivate such talents, at the macro level, the Korean language department should seek diversified talent training models that cultivate “Korean+” compound talents through domestic and international cooperation, and college-enterprise cooperation, aiming for the demand for social and economic development and industrial restructuring. In addition, it is necessary to improve students' comprehensive abilities while focusing on human nature education. On the other hand, at the microscopic level, an interdisciplinary approach is required to establish the curriculum system and faculty. In textbook development and class design, it is necessary to focus on integrating the contents of ideological and political education and enhancing students' humanity qualities and comprehensive abilities."

AI시대에 교사의 역할은 종래와 같은 ‘가르치고 기른다’는 ‘Teaching’의 역할만으로는 한계가 있다. 현재 ‘Teaching’ 부분은 온라인 학습이나 AI 등의 Technology로 대체되기 시작하고 있으며, 향후에는 그 속도가 한층 더 가속되어 갈 것이다. 이제 교사에게는 ‘끌어내고, 늘리다’는 의미의 ‘Coaching’의 역할이 보다 중요해졌고, 학생에게는 학습(learning)이 훨씬 더 중요해졌다.기업에 초점을 맞춰 봐도, ‘산업혁명’이라고 표현될 만큼 충격이 큰 구조적 변화가 이 Technology와 Society의 작용으로 발생하는 결과로서 산업구조가 어떻게 변화할지에 대한 확실한 예측을 하는 것은 지극히 어렵다. 여기에 덧붙여 한국은 고령화와 인구감소라고 하는 사회문제를 안고 있다. 가히 세계에서 가장 복잡한 ‘문제를 가진 국가’라 할 수 있다. 2030년의 시장환경과 산업구조가 불투명한 가운데, 어떠한 타개책을 생각하며, 어떻게 ‘2030’의 세계를 열어 가면 좋은가? 이러한 타개책의 방안으로 제시할 수 있는 것이 사회구성원의 공통가치의 창조(CSV: Creating Shared Value)이다.회사에서도 CSV의 중요성을 강조하여 CSV 경영으로의 진화가 매우 중요한 경영과제의 하나가 되었다. 종래의 자기 회사에 대한 가치창출을 자기 완결형으로 추구하는 에고형 모델에서 CSV에 의한 장래 에고형 모델로의 패러다임 전환이 일어나는 상황에서 한국 사회와 기업이 얼마나 대응할 수 있는가가 성공적인 조직 경영의 갈림길이 될 것이다. 그 중에서 필자는 네덜란드와 미국에서의 교육경험에 의한 사례연구법이 제시한 ‘미래에 선택할 조직’의 ‘형태’를 제안하였다. 1. 교사와 직장인의 파트타임제 도입, 2. PBL(Project-based Learning) 구현장의 제공, 3. 다양한 이해관계자와 협업하는 마음자세 이상의 3가지를 바탕으로 AI 시대 교육에 공헌하는 새로운 기업과 교육기관의 형태에 대해 기술하였다.","As the technology represented by artificial intelligence (AI) leads the 4th industrial revolution and they bring about changes in the industrial structure, it is predicted that employment and labor will also change significantly. With the rapid development of science and technology, more and more people are worried that computers can take away human jobs, and verification has been made. Even in the Industrial Revolution up to now, there have been many ‘disappearing jobs,’ but there are also ‘new jobs.’ However, the transformation brought about by the 4th industrial revolution is considered to be of a different quality from the past, which said that “people become unnecessary.” Therefore, this study conducted a review of the technology required in the AI ​​era, using prior research and insurance reports from various institutions as a clue. As a result, it turns out that in the AI ​​era, communication technology is the key to distinguishing what AI can do from what humans can do. After that, as one of the communication skills nurturing methods, the research was conducted focusing on the possibility of liberal arts (artes liberales).What education is really needed in the 21st century? With the advent of the AI ​​(Artificial Intelligence) era, the era has come when we have to rethink the essential attitude of education itself from the ground up. In the age of AI, the role of a teacher is limited only to the role of ‘teaching’, which is ‘teaching and nurturing’ as in the past. Currently, the ‘teaching’ part is starting to be replaced by technology such as online learning or AI, and the speed will further accelerate in the future. Now, the role of ‘coaching,’ which means ‘to draw out and increase,’ has become more important.Even if we focus on the company, it is extremely difficult to predict with certainty how the industrial structure will change as a result of the multiplication of this technology and society, which is a structural change with a large impact to be described as an ‘industrial revolution.’ In addition, Korea faces social problems such as aging and population decline. Indeed, it can be said to be the most advanced ‘task developed country’ in the world. With the market environment and industrial structure of 2030 unclear, what kind of countermeasures do you think and how should we open the world of ‘2030’? What can be suggested as a hint for a solution is the CSV (Creating Shared Value) of members of society.The importance of CSV in companies is increasing even more, and the evolution to CSV management is finally becoming one of the important management tasks. In the paradigm shift from the conventional ego-type system type, which is this model that pursues value creation for one’s own company in a self-conclusive type, to a future ecosystem that adds ‘representative power’ and ‘order-type power’ by CSV, Korean society and How much a company can respond will be the turning point for successful management in the SDGs era. Among them, I would like to suggest the ‘form’ of the ‘company to be chosen in the future’ suggested by the case study method based on educational experience in the Netherlands and the United States. I would like to describe 1. Introduction of part-time system (teachers and office workers), 2. Provision of a project-based learning implementation space, 3. A mindset of collaborating with various stakeholders, based on the above three factors, a new type of company that contributes to education in the AI ​​era."
"The health effects of low blood lead level in oxidative stress as a marker, serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase level, in male steelworkers",2022,"['Lead', 'Occupational exposure', 'Oxidative stress', 'Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase']",,"Background: This study aimed to investigate the association between lead exposure and serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γGT) levels as an oxidative stress marker in male steelworkers. Methods: Data were collected during the annual health examination of workers in 2020. A total of 1,654 steelworkers were selected, and the variables for adjustment included the workers' general characteristics, lifestyle, and occupational characteristics. The association between the blood lead level (BLL) and serum γGT level was investigated by multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. The BLL and serum γGT values that were transformed into natural logarithms were used in multiple linear regression analysis, and the tertile of BLL was used in logistic regression analysis. Results: The geometric mean of the participants' BLLs and serum γGT level was 1.36 ㎍/dL and 27.72 IU/L, respectively. Their BLLs differed depending on age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, drinking status, shift work, and working period, while their serum γGT levels differed depending on age, BMI, smoking status, drinking status, physical activity, and working period. In multiple linear regression analysis, the difference in models 1, 2, and 3 was significant, obtaining 0.326, 0.176, and 0.172 (all: p < 0.001), respectively. In the multiple linear regression analysis stratified according to drinking status, BMI, and age, BLLs were positively associated with serum γGT levels. Regarding the logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio of the third BLL tertile in models 1, 2, and 3 (for having an elevated serum γGT level within the first tertile reference) was 2.74, 1.83, and 1.81, respectively. Conclusions: BLL was positively associated with serum γGT levels in male steelworkers even at low lead concentrations (< 5 ㎍/dL)."

Specifically, the reader has been identified as modificating and transforming the traditional reader role through activities such as expanding the interface with the author in a multifaceted way, evaluating the author’s literary project proposal, or playing the role of co-creator proposed by the author. Based on this, the literary educational implications were that a model of diverse relationships between literary works and readers should be presented, that learners’ experiences of active participation in literary culture should be activated, and that a multifaceted link between literary reading and creating should be explored."

For highly accurate topography characteriza- tion, a large number of training images with various background conditions are required. Since the real lunar topography images are difficult to obtain, it should be helpful to be able to generate mimic lunar image data artificially on the basis of the planetary analogs site images and real lunar images available. In this study, we aim to artificially create lunar topography images by using the location information-based style transfer algorithm known as Wavelet Correct Transform (WCT2). We conducted comparative experiments using lunar analog site images and real lunar topography images taken during China's and America's lunar-exploring projects (i.e., Chang’e and Apollo) to assess the efficacy of our suggested approach. The results show that the proposed techniques can create realistic images, which preserve the topography information of the analog site image while still showing the same condition as an image taken on lunar surface. The proposed algorithm also outperforms a conventional algorithm, Deep Photo Style Transfer (DPST) in terms of temporal and visual aspects. For future work, we intend to use the generated styled image data in combination with real image data for training lunar topography objects to be applied for topographic detection and segmentation. It is expected that this approach can significantly improve the performance of detection and segmentation models on real lunar topography images."

Based on Javascript and JQuery, the logistics system realizes real-time monitoring, collection of historical status data, statistical analysis and display, intelligent recommendation and other functions. In order to strengthen the cooperation of warehouse storage, enhance the utilization rate of resources, and achieve the purpose of real-time and visual supervision of transportation equipment and cargo tracking, this paper studies the VNF dynamic deployment and SFC routing problem in the network load change scenario based on the logistics system. The BIP model is used to model the VNF dynamic deployment and routing problem. The optimization objective is to minimize the total cost overhead generated by each SFCR. Furthermore, the application of the SFC mapping algorithm in the routing topology solving problem is proposed. Based on the concept of relative cost and the idea of topology transformation, the SFC-map algorithm can efficiently complete the dynamic deployment of VNF and the routing calculation of SFC by using multi-layer graph. In the simulation platform based on the logistics system, the proposed algorithm is compared with VNF-DRA algorithm and Provision Traffic algorithm in the network receiving rate, throughput, path end-to-end delay, deployment number, running time and utilization rate. According to the test results, it is verified that the test results of the optimization algorithm in this paper are obviously improved compared with the comparison method, and it has higher practical application and promotion value."

For this, an understanding of the US strategy for global hegemony, which is the biggest key variable in this war, must be preceded. The liberalism and realism of the existing international politics have limitations that are dependent on actual change due to the lack of understanding of the substantive nature of hegemony. Among the theory of system transition, Modelski and Thompson's leading technology and the principle of co-evolution of hegemony are approaching the essence of hegemony. Another master of system transformation theory, Giovanni Arigi, explains the cycle of hegemony by transposition of the material and financial accumulations, and at the same time, identifies the differentiation of US hegemony by internalizing protection costs, production costs, and transaction costs. However, there is no clear explanation as to why this cycle does not apply to the present-day United States.Richard Baldwin's theory, which explains the history of modern capitalism from the movement of goods to the movement of knowledge, makes it possible to infer that the establishment and domination of the knowledge-based global vertical division of labor makes the continuity of current American hegemony possible. In particular, Germany is a strategically important partner for the United States as a key hub constituting this global value chain. The recent US-China conflict stems from China's threat to the US' top position in this system. The Ukrainian War demonstrates the mosaic warfare, a war system based on the new Knowledge production and distribution system such as AI and Starlink, proving that the United States is a leader in the technology-based global vertical division of labor system, while at the same time gives opportunity to break Germany, which is strengthening its ties with China, from China."

It shows that the municipality has focused on urban development and land use planning tools to attain the two objectives of housing construction and reduction in construction costs. The second major finding is that the housing policy was considered as an axis of social policy, especially in association with full financial support for families with children. Third, the Munich Mix accommodated market expectations, but it is also co-creating social value and transformation through policy interventions. Taken together, these findings suggest several courses of action for affordable housing and the social mix in Korea, including collaborative governance through public-private partnerships (PPP), the need for a new philosophy of housing policies with inclusive designs, and new financing models for affordable housing construction. However, despite the government’s continuing efforts in Munich, it still does not seem to be enough for them to solve the housing problems due to (1) a lack of aggressive policy intervention to pursue housing and rental price stability, (2) insufficient supply of publicly-owned vacant lands for housing construction, (3) delay in resolving the issues of land expropriation and compensation, (4) the placing of an excessive financial burden and redemption on the private sector, and (5) a chronic issue of housing provision."
디자인 인공지능을 활용하기 위한 조형 언어 연구 -베이비 스키마 조형 언어를 중심으로-,2022,"['Baby schema', 'Artificial intelligence design', 'Digital design language', 'GPT3', '베이비 스키마', '인공지능 디자인', '디지털 조형언어', 'GPT3']",,"(Background and purpose of research) With the emergence of a new design system known as artificial intelligence (AI) design, various discussions and studies beyond creative applications are being actively conducted. This study aims to discuss correct AI-based design research through the automatic generation of shapes based on a baby schema for cuteness and linguistic definitions of shape elements. Focusing on the visual and formative characteristics of the baby schema, which expresses cuteness considering universal aesthetic factors, the precise meaning of formative language and correct formative design methods are explained. From the perspective of evolutionary aesthetics and neuroaesthetics, we therefore explore the relationship between the digital language of AI and the supernormal stimulation and peak-shift cuteness of spatial modeling elements, aiming to derive and quantify human modeling language as a digital language for AI. (Method) To study the visual form of baby schemas using a digital formative language, first, through research on baby schemas as universal aesthetics, the likability mechanism behind cuteness is defined from an evolutionary aesthetic viewpoint. Second, through prior neurological research, the close relationship between the aesthetic sense of sculpture and language is examined. Third, the possibility of transforming Babiskima’s reduced plastic language into the digital plastic language of artificial intelligence is confirmed. Fourth, the baby schema’s eight digital modeling elements were verified through AI modeling experiments. (Results) To reproduce the aesthetic sense of sculpture with AI, we attempted to reconstruct the linguistic structure and found there is a difference in perception between humans and AI in interpreting phenomena. We also found that for the correct presentation, we needed to use the reduced-structure aesthetic language that composes the baby schema. This is a reminder that not only AI but also designers themselves must exercise correct cognitive thinking.(Conclusion) Cuteness can be defined as a concept of supernormal stimulus because it is an essential mechanism for human survival, which we reduced to a language of form. Pretty shapes, textures, colors, and environments serve as supernormal stimuli for the cognitive mechanisms of our aesthetic intelligence. Then, through a defined formative language, AI can be used to structurally reproduce the form of cuteness as a grammar of cuteness. This study will hopefully serve to guide the correct use and imagination of formative language as a means of expressing designers’ aesthetic sense."

Even when there is insufficient data in the reliability analysis, successful results can be derived if an appropriate prior distribution is used. In this paper, by analyzing the failure information of old parts that have been discontinued, the gamma distribution and the simple uniform distribution were proposed as prior distributions for new parts by considering average values and deviations. Here, by mathematically transforming the likelihood function, the Bayesian reliability characteristics of new parts with no failure characteristics were studied. It was found that it is possible to calculate the quantitative reliability value of zero failures information, which cannot be done in classical statistics. Also, in the case of the prior distribution developed with the uniform distribution and the gamma distribution, both prior distributions can produce quantitative values, but the model of the prior distribution made from the gamma distribution is expected to give a more explicit effect to field technicians in interpreting the posterior distribution."

The criteria for judging soundness include whether stock prices are determined by long-term equilibrium variables, whether there is a trend among non-long-term equilibrium variables, and whether long-term equilibrium variables of overseas stocks are identified during the Korean stock price determination process. Further, a co-integration test is performed using the VAR model which comprises the stock prices from Korea and the United States, and their long-term economic equilibrium variables. Furthermore, a transformation error correction model with a VAR type consisting of differences and cointegration errors in Korean stock prices is derived. Accordingly, the trend of long-term equilibrium variables is estimated using the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition of Korean stock prices. Furthermore, a test for its presence is performed. According to the empirical analysis conducted using monthly Korean data; the influence of the long-term equilibrium variable trend in the Korean economy tends to increase the stock prices following a financial crisis."

However, few studies have explored the internal mechanism of action between inclusive leadership and innovative behavior. This study investigates how inclusive leadership influences employees' innovative behavior through error management climate and self-efficacy. Taking error management climate and self-efficacy as intermediary variables, the author constructs a theoretical, conceptual model of the dual-path mechanism of inclusive leadership on employees' innovative behavior based on multiple mediating variables. The author conducts an online questionnaire survey of on-the-job employees of Chinese Internet technology companies and adopts SPSS21.0 and AMOS 24.0 to carry out an empirical analysis of the questionnaire survey data.

The research methods are thought and design theory, design thinking theory, and collision/fusion theory of design thought.Pre-modern design thought encompassed the transformation of traditional Chinese design against the advancement of Western design into 'classicism'. The modern design thought was represented by Bauhaus's 'minimalism' as the most dominant thought. In the contemporary design ideology, 'modernism', which emphasizes 'function' and 'artistic', takes its place as a symbol.Pre-modern design theories and forms show a style that combines the traditional ideas of ‘high engineering’ with Western ‘rococo style’. As for modern design theory and form, Western ‘minimalism’ has taken a dominant position in China. Contemporary design theories and forms represent the embodiment of the restoration of 'humanism' and 'artisticity'.In conclusion, I have three things: First, Chinese design thought are represented by pre-modern 'classicism', modern 'minimalism', and contemporary 'modernism'. Second, the 'modernism' trend has established itself as a dominant trend in all eras of China since the modern era and seeks a Chinese 'new style' in line with the revival of traditional design.

Test fractions were assayed for antiradical activities using electron spin resonance spectrometry, β-carotene-linoleate model and Folin-Ciocalteu assay; and antimicrobial activity against 2 Gram-negative bacteria, 4 Gram-positive bacteria and 2 fungal species using the disc diffusion assay. All fractions were also subjected to Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis to identify types of functional groups present. It was found that the hydrophilic extracts (H<sub>2</sub>O fractions) possessed the most effective radical scavenging activity (p < 0.05) while the lipophilic extracts (PE fractions) the most active antimicrobial activity, especially against Gram-positive bacteria (p < 0.05). Total oxidation substrates content was found to be highest in the PE fractions of jellyfish bell and oral arms (p < 0.05).

Invertebrate insects, such as black soldier flies, grasshoppers, mealworms, housefly larvae, and crickets, have been used as human food and as feed for nonruminants and aqua culture while for ruminants their use has been limited. Insects can be mass-produced, parti­cipating in a circular economy that minimizes or eliminates food- and feed-waste through bioconversion. Although the model for formula-scale production of insects as feed for domestic animals has been explored for a number of years, significant production and transformation to being a conventional protein resource remains to be deeply investigated. This review will focus on the nutritional composition of various insects and their potential use as alternative protein sources, as well as their potential use to promote and support sustainable animal production. Furthermore, nutritional compositions, such as high protein, lauric acid omega 6, and omega 3, and bioactive compounds, such as chitin, are of great potential use for animal feeding."
"Evolution and Sedimentation Mechanisms of Estuarine Beach in the Nakdong River Estuary, Korea: Natural and Human Impact",2022,"['Estuarine beach', 'Nakdong River', 'Each evolution', 'Sediment transport', 'Quasi-equilibrium']",,"Dadae Beach located in the Nakdong River estuary has been continuously evolving as the result of natural and anthropogenetic activities. Due to the geographic characteristics of an estuarine beach, in which the estuary, ocean, and human activities converge, it is very difficult to identify the factors shaping changes in the sedimentary environment and present quantitative results. Nevertheless, this study presents a survey of hydrological characteristics that reveals major depositional mechanisms and the factors impacting the sedimentary environment by analyzing morphological variations over the last five decades. We found that Dadae Beach has transformed from a marine system to an estuarine system through three major stages of evolution over the last five decades and has now reached a quasi-equilibrium state. The depositional mechanism contributing to the deposition of Dadae Beach is mainly driven by rainfall during the wet season. In addition, the strengthening of ocean energy during the dry season causes erosion. By proposing a new evolutionary history of Dadae Beach which had previously been considered a byproduct of the barrier island generation process of the Nakdong River, we suggest a novel conceptual model for estuarine beach evolution."

A Study on the Improvement of Color Detection Performance of Unmanned Salt Collection Vehicles Using an Image Processing Algorithm,2022,['HSV'],,"The population of Korea's solar salt-producing regions is rapidly aging, resulting in a decrease in the number of productive workers. In solar salt production, salt collection is the most labor-intensive operation because existing salt collection vehicles require human operators. Therefore, we intend to develop an unmanned solar salt collection vehicle to reduce manpower requirements. The unmanned solar salt collection vehicle is designed to identify the salt collection status and location in the salt plate via color detection, the color detection performance is a crucial consideration. Therefore, an image processing algorithm was developed to improve color detection performance. The algorithm generates an around-view image by using resizing, rotation, and perspective transformation of the input image, set the RoI to transform only the corresponding area to the HSV color model, and detects the color area through an AND operation. The detected color area was expanded and noise removed using morphological operations, and the area of the detection region was calculated using contour and image moment. The calculated area is compared with the set area to determine the location case of the collection vehicle within the salt plate. The performance was evaluated by comparing the calculated area of the final detected color to which the algorithm was applied and the area of the detected color in each step of the algorithm. It was confirmed that the color detection performance is improved by at least 25-99% for salt detection, at least 44-68% for red color, and an average of 7% for blue and an average of 15% for green. The proposed approach is well-suited to the operation of unmanned solar salt collection vehicles."
Towards Improving Causality Mining using BERT with Multi-level Feature Networks,2022,"['Causality Mining', 'Relation Network', 'Multi-level Relation Network', 'Relation Classification', 'Cause-effect Relation Classification']",,"Causality mining in NLP is a significant area of interest, which benefits in many daily life applications, including decision making, business risk management, question answering, future event prediction, scenario generation, and information retrieval. Mining those causalities was a challenging and open problem for the prior non-statistical and statistical techniques using web sources that required hand-crafted linguistics patterns for feature engineering, which were subject to domain knowledge and required much human effort. Those studies overlooked implicit, ambiguous, and heterogeneous causality and focused on explicit causality mining. In contrast to statistical and non-statistical approaches, we present Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) integrated with Multi-level Feature Networks (MFN) for causality recognition, called BERT+MFN for causality recognition in noisy and informal web datasets without human-designed features. In our model, MFN consists of a three-column knowledge-oriented network (TC-KN), bi-LSTM, and Relation Network (RN) that mine causality information at the segment level. BERT captures semantic features at the word level. We perform experiments on Alternative Lexicalization (AltLexes) datasets. The experimental outcomes show that our model outperforms baseline causality and text mining techniques."
Extraction of raspberry ketone from red raspberry and its intervention in the non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease,2022,"['Red raspberry ketone', 'Extraction and purification', 'NAFLD', 'Functional food']",,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by diffused hepatocyte bullous fat in the liver, which is not caused by alcohol or drugs like amiodarone and tamoxifen. Presently, no drug is approved for NAFLD treatment. Therefore, it’s important to extract effective components from natural plants to alleviate NAFLD. In this study, we extracted and purified raspberry ketone, a natural phenolic compound from red raspberry ( Rubus ideaus L.) by an ultrasonic-assisted ethanol extraction method. The structure of red raspberry ketone (RRK) was determined using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and the purity of RRK was found as 80.06 ± 1.19%. After 28 days of intragastric administration of RRK, the bodyweight of NAFLD model rats decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Besides, the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and total triglyceride (TG) decreased and the content of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in serum increased drastically. Moreover, the level of liver damage indicators (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase) and the levels of glucose, insulin, free-fatty acid, tumor necrotic factor-α in the liver decreased distinctly. The levels of TG and malondialdehyde in the liver decreased, whereas the levels of superoxide dismutase, total glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase drastically increased. We also found that RRK reduced the uneven size of liver cells and blurred boundaries of hepatic lobules, and alleviated hepatic steatosis and inflammation caused by NAFLD. We inferred that RRK could relieve NAFLD progression by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and alleviating oxidative stress in vivo. This study sheds new light on the use of RRK as a functional food for NAFLD prevention."
Multiobjective reliability-based design optimization approach using the gray system and evidence theory,2022,"['Multi-objective reliability-based design optimization', 'Multi-objective weight quantitative', 'Evidence theory', 'Grey incidence analysis', 'Ideal attribute deviation degree']",,"Aimed at the subjectivity of selecting the weight of each objective function in the process of multiobjective reliability-based design optimization (MRBDO), this study proposed a multiobjective weight quantitative analysis method by combining the gray incidence analysis method and evidence theory. This method derived the weight of each objective function from the uncertainty information of design variables, and effectively avoided the subjectivity of weight selection. First, the ideal attribute interval number and the interval number matrix of uncertain design variables were defined based on the gray system theory. On the basis of the definition of the information structure sequence, the gray incidence coefficient (GIC) matrix of measures with ideal attribute deviations was derived. Second, the basic probability assignment of each objective function and model under uncertainty variables was derived based on the DempsterShafer evidence theory. The Dempster-Shafer evidence synthesis rule was used to fuse the multisource evidence information to obtain the weight of each objective function. Then, an MRBDO problem was converted into a single-objective reliability-based design optimization (SRBDO) problem, which is relatively easier to address. Third, the performance measurement analysis (PMA) method was used to transform the reliability constraint into an optimized iterative process, and the MRBDO solution was obtained based on the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox and Symbol Toolbox. Finally, the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method were verified through a numerical example and a small aeroengine gear reduction system."
Severe Weather Traffic Scene Reconstruction using Inherent Augmented Style Encoding Adversarial Network,2022,"['generative adversarial network', 'image generation', 'image reconstruction', 'scene classification', 'object detection']",,"Vision classification and object detection is a critical task for autonomous systems, essentially for driving assistant systems. Lots of research contributing to improving the vision classification system, especially the Artificial Intelligence (AI) visual analysis technologies have been elevated notably the interest in driving assistance systems. The deep learning-based visual classification methods achieved enormous accuracy in classifying visual scenes in the different fields of vision application. However, the visual classifiers still face some difficulties in working under extreme weather conditions. For example, examining the scenes in severe weather conditions,  especially during rainy nights and foggy weather, is the main challenge for vision algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithm struggles to identify the common contexts of the scenes. This paper introduced an adversarial scene reconstructing model that restores dark and uncleared scenes to transform explicit scenes like daytime. After that, the reconstructed image is applied to a recognition algorithm to recognize the autonomous vehicle's visual actions."
PointMS: Semantic Segmentation for Point Cloud Based on Multi-scale Directional Convolution,2022,"['Deep learning', 'point cloud', 'semantic segmentation', 'spatial structure information.']",,"In the field of point cloud scene segmentation with deep learning, the ability of the network to extract spatial structure information limits the performance of semantic segmentation. This work proposes a novel framework named PointMS, which handles the semantic segmentation of point cloud scene, to solve the problem of missing local feature information due to the lack of spatial structure information on the training stage. The structure of framework utilizes spatial structure information of point cloud and balances the extraction of global feature and subtle feature when processing point cloud data. Firstly, a multi-scale combination module (SIFT-MS) is used to extract local features of different scales for enhancing the perception of local structure information at each point. Secondly, the process of feature transmission often leads to the loss of information, so a feature supplement module (FSM) is proposed to complete the information lost after feature transformation through the effective combination of global feature and subtle feature. This module integrates the features of different locations to supplement the information lost in feature conversion. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is efficient for semantic segmentation of S3DIS dataset. SIFT-MS module and FSM module can effectively improve the performance of the semantic segmentation model of point cloud."
Exploring reward effi cacy in traffi c management using deep reinforcement learning in intelligent transportation system,2022,"['DRL', 'edge computing', 'ITS', 'PPO', 'traffic signal']",,"In the last decade, substantial progress has been achieved in intelligent traffic control technologies to overcome consistent difficulties of traffic congestion and its adverse effect on smart cities. Edge computing is one such advanced progress facilitating real-time data transmission among vehicles and roadside units to mitigate congestion. An edge computing-based deep reinforcement learning system is demonstrated in this study that appropriately designs a multiobjective reward function for optimizing different objectives. The system seeks to overcome the challenge of evaluating actions with a simple numerical reward. The selection of reward functions has a significant impact on agents’ ability to acquire the ideal behavior for managing multiple traffic signals in a large-scale road network. To ascertain effective reward functions, the agent is trained withusing the proximal policy optimization method in several deep neural network models, including the state-of-the-art transformer network. The system is verified using both hypothetical scenarios and real-world traffic maps. The comprehensive simulation outcomes demonstrate the potency of the suggested reward functions."
“Citizened by Friendship”: Feeling Intimate beyond the Nation-State in Michael Ondaatje’s Anil’s Ghost,2022,"['Michael Ondaatje', 'Anil’s Ghost', 'intimacy', 'friendship', 'Sri Lankan civil war']",,"Michael Ondaatje’s Anil’s Ghost centers on solving the case of Sailor. Set in the midst of the Sri Lankan war, the novel features Anil Tissera, a Sri Lankan born forensic specialist who works for an international human rights organization based in Geneva, coming across an unidentified skeleton while conducting research in her native place. Suspecting the skeleton to be a victim of government violence, Anil commits herself to the recuperation of the skeleton’s identity. The investigation leads to an unexpected collaboration with two local male figures, Sarath, an archeologist affiliated with the Sri Lankan government, and Ananda, a former artisan who currently works as a gem-pit worker. The process of solving Sailor’s case gives rise to a structure of feeling that radically transforms their relationship. Three strangers who differ in nationality, gender, profession, and even language come to feel deeply drawn to each other. Attending to the novel’s interest in tracing a model of burgeoning friendship connecting three strangers, this essay examines how feelings of intimacy explored in the form of friendship in Anil’s Ghost departing from its common association with the private and familial to gain social and political meaning in the Sri Lankan civil war context. By focusing on intimacy’s communal dimension and transformative powers, this essay argues that the novel’s exploration of friendship as a model of affective community, not only critically responding to the Sri Lankan civil war’s conflict and violence, gives shape to a flexible social imagination that embraces the tensions and risks of difference."

When rewriting his unfinished Greek fragments into a first-person narrative in 1819, John Keats conducts a major reassessment of Moneta’s role in the project, the Roman equivalent of Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory and the mother of the Muses. He redefines Moneta’s relation to the poet-narrator, the poem’s main protagonist who is engaged in an increasingly self-conscious quest for knowledge of his true self and merits and who eventually undergoes a radical transformation into a superior Olympian god of music and poetry, replacing his Titanic predecessor. The goddess of memory and oral culture embodies an alternative discourse surprisingly decentered and polyvocal in nature. The conventional assumption that writing is a product of the solitary genius is obscured now by an interwoven fabric of discussion, feedback, narrative interventions, negotiations, and textual instability. In so doing, the second-generation English Romantic refutes the assumption that poetic power is a product of a heroic mind and philosophical solipsism rather than a result of a dialogic quest for knowledge."

Ellis)의 유대해방신학은 출발한다. 유대인의 특수한 경험이 어떻게 보편적 인류를 위한 정의와 평화의 공동체 실현이란 과제로 이어질지 질문한다. 엘리스는 콘스탄틴 유대교로 대표되는 유대 정복주의를 비판하면서, 예언자적 해방 전통에 입각해서 유배자의 삶을 실천할 것을 주장한다. 유배의 삶이란 지배적 종교의 가치와 기준을 거절하고 거리를 둔 채 억눌린 자들을 철저하게 품어내는 신실한 삶을 의미한다. 유대해방신학은 무엇으로부터의 해방이라는 질문과 더불어 무엇을 위한 해방인가라는 질문을 동시에 다룬다. 이를 통해 억압의 경험이 자기 정당화의 도구가 아니라 자기 초월의 가능성으로 이해되어야 한다. 그리고 자신의 정체성에 관한 현재적 이해는 해방의 미래적 과제로 열려져야 한다.유대해방신학은 이제 억압자와 피억압자의 적대적 이분법적 구조를 넘어서서 보다 인간답고 정의로운 공동체를 향한 연대적 실천이 필요함을 강조한다. 본 논문은 이를 위한 기반으로 생명의 상호관계성에 관한 적극적 해석과 나는 타자와의 관계 그 자체라는 인식 가운데 나와 타자가 분리될 수 없음을 주장한다. 마지막으로 새로운 해방의 과제를 수행할 도덕적 주체는 개별적이면서도 공동체적 속성을 가진 유기적 도덕 주체일 필요가 있음도 제안하고 있다.","The violence of religion resulted from an unjust alliance between Christian church and state-power has appeared as anti-Semitism in the western history and culminated in the tragic event of Holocaust. Since Holocaust, mainline Jewish theology mostly has focused on the fundamental aspects of Zionism. Israel as a state-power has strongly attempted to empower Israel itself. The nationalism that Jewish identity should be firmly defined has flourished. Empowerment issues often made it happen to use imperialistic violence against neighbor states and an essentialized Jewish Identity intensified a tendency of nationalistic exclusivity. As a result, Jews as victims in the event of Holocaust came to make Palestinian people another victim. From this critical viewpoint, a Jewish theology of liberation named by Marc H. Ellis started. He raised a question of how the particularity of Jewish experiences can be transformed into supporting a task of realizing a more just humane community. While criticizing Constantine Judaism as Jewish triumphalism, Ellis insists a life of exile based on prophetic liberative traditions. Practicing exile in the harsh reality means to refuse major values and standards of the dominant religion and to embrace the oppressed with fidelity. A Jewish theology of liberation always deals with one question of what we have to be liberated from and at the same time the other question of for what we have to liberate ourselves. Through the process of answering these two questions, oppressed experiences should not be used as an unjust tool of self-justification but as a possibility of self-transcendence. The current understanding of self-identity has to be led into some liberative tasks of the future.A Jewish theology of liberation now makes it clear that we need to overcome a hostile dualistic relation between oppressors and the oppressed and go beyond it toward the practice of solidarity toward a more just humane community. To participate in this practice of solidarity, the thesis suggests that an intentional but responsible interpretation of radical interrelatedness as a religious biodiversity and a critical understanding of inseparability between self and others should be claimed. Finally it also suggests that a model of organic moral agent who is individualistic and at the same time communal should be needed in order to practice a responsible task for a more just humane community."

Sufficient discussion, public support, and social consensus are needed to accommodate and support refugees. This study analyzed how public attitudes toward refugees shifted over time, focusing on the 2018 Jeju Yemeni refugee problems (about 550 Yemenis applied for refugee status on Jeju Island), where there was domestic controversy over the increase in the number of refugees. The subject of analysis is 359,984 comments on 13,481 articles from major daily newspapers and news broadcasters in 2015–2021. Analysis of individual comments was conducted through sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP). For this, KcBERT, a Korean Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, was used. In addition, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to understand the influence relationship. The analysis showed that the proportion of negative public opinion on refugees was high both before and after the Jeju Yemen refugee crisis; negative public opinion increased overwhelmingly; and the reasons for this were more diverse. In addition, negative public opinion on the positive and negative ratios immediately increased as a result of the impact analysis but this did not affect the overall trend. We draw theoretical and practical implications based on these results."

The discussion focused on the process of confirming that these works have been functioning as a kind of “Ye-ack” within the ritual or social trend.In the process of re-contextualizing “Guji-ga” songs into “Hea-ga,” the poetic and musical traditions are confirmed. The songs of the “Guji-ga” series have been divided into cases related to social and political problems and those related to personal problems regarding utility while maintaining the constancy of the shamanic song. This trend proves that public witchcraft has been useful for the integration of heterogeneous groups or the resolution of conflicts according to the transformation of the times and cultural history. This point is equivalent to the function or utility of music and art.“Hwangjo-ga” is a poem that has been re-functionalized to have ritual and political utility by selecting a collective lyric folk song that spread widely at the time. In this respect, the appearance of “Hwangjo-ga” contains the political intention of King Yuri to promote stability and harmony by relying on collective sensibility through ritual or ritualistic reasons. In other words, “Hwangjo-ga” fully supports the universal tradition and the sadistic tradition of Korean poetry history, 謠) into the ga (歌).“Dosolga” is a work in which poetry has been re-operated to suit the times. Like in previous studies, the poetry of “Dosolga” is a series of works ranging from the creation of “Dosolga” of King Yuri to that of “Dosolga” of Wolmyeongsa. These songs support magical and ritualistic perceptions about strengthening royal authority and social stability and form a tradition of poetry and music. Additionally, the “Dosolga” of Wolmyeongsa is meaningful in its emergence and transmission as a clue to the poetic and musical tradition that has continued until the age of eight in that it combines the magical power of “songs” and “singing.”As such, the branch of ancient poetry allows us to examine the reality of traditional ga-ack and Ye-ack thinking. The view that the ancient city is limited to a single species and is regarded as a corrosive product that has been cut off before the appearance of incense sticks should be changed. The ancient poetry group is also of significance as a model of our poetry history that triggered poetic tradition and traditional Ye-ack in the lullaby of ritual and music (Ga-ack) used in it."

An optimized deployment strategy of smart smoke sensors in a large space,2022,"['NB-IoT', 'optimized deployment strategy', 'smart smoke sensors', 'large space', 'intelligent optimization algorithm', 'coverage accuracy', 'deployment cost']",,"With the development of the NB-IoT (Narrow band Internet of Things) and smart cities, coupled with the emergence of smart smoke sensors, new requirements and issues have been introduced to study on the deployment of sensors in large spaces. Previous research mainly focuses on the optimization of wireless sensors in some monitoring environments, including three-dimensional terrain or underwater space. There are relatively few studies on the optimization deployment problem of smart smoke sensors, and leaving large spaces with obstacles such as libraries out of consideration. This paper mainly studies the deployment issue of smart smoke sensors in large spaces by considering the fire probability of fire areas and the obstacles in a monitoring area. To cope with the problems of coverage blind areas and coverage redundancy when sensors are deployed randomly in large spaces, we proposed an optimized deployment strategy of smart smoke sensors based on the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm. The deployment problem is transformed into a multi-objective optimization problem with many constraints of fire probability and barriers, while minimizing the deployment cost and maximizing the coverage accuracy. In this regard, we describe the structure model in large space and a coverage model firstly, then a mathematical model containing two objective functions is established. Finally, a deployment strategy based on PSO algorithm is designed, and the performance of the deployment strategy is verified by a number of simulation experiments. The obtained experimental and numerical results demonstrates that our proposed strategy can obtain better performance than uniform deployment strategies in terms of all the objectives concerned, further demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy. Additionally, the strategy we proposed also provides theoretical guidance and a practical basis for fire emergency management and other departments to better deploy smart smoke sensors in a large space."
데이터 증강을 위한 순환 생성적 적대 신경망 기반의 아스팔트와 콘크리트 균열 영상 간의 변환 기법,2022,[],,"The safe use of a structure requires it to be maintained in an undamaged state. Thus, a typical factor that determines the safety of a structure is a crack in it. In addition, cracks are caused by various reasons, damage the structure in various ways, and exist in different shapes. Making matters worse, if these cracks are unattended, the risk of structural failure increases and proceeds to a catastrophe. Hence, recently, methods of checking structural damage using deep learning and computer vision technology have been introduced. These methods usually have the premise that there should be a large amount of training image data. However, the amount of training image data is always insufficient. Particularly, this insufficiency negatively affects the performance of deep learning crack detection algorithms. Hence, in this study, a method of augmenting crack image data based on the image translation technique was developed. In particular, this method obtained the crack image data for training a deep learning neural network model by transforming a specific case of a asphalt crack image into a concrete crack image or vice versa . Eventually, this method expected that a robust crack detection algorithm could be developed by increasing the diversity of its training data."

In this study, we expand earthquake information such as occurrence time, hypocentral location, and magnitude to produce a dataset for applying to machine learning, reducing the dimension of the expended data into dominant features through principal component analysis. The dimensional extended data comprises statistics of the earthquake information from the Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalog containing 36,699 seismic events. We perform data preprocessing using standard and max-min scaling and extract dominant features with principal components analysis from the scaled dataset. The scaling methods significantly reduced the deviation of feature values caused by different units. Among them, the standard scaling method transforms the median of each feature with a smaller deviation than other scaling methods. The six principal components extracted from the non-scaled dataset explain 99% of the original data. The sixteen principal components from the datasets, which are applied with standardization or max-min scaling, reconstruct 98% of the original datasets. These results indicate that more principal components are needed to preserve original data information with even distributed feature values. We propose a data processing method for efficient and accurate machine learning model to analyze the relationship between seismic data and seismic behavior."
A Domain-independent Dual-image based Robust Reversible Watermarking,2022,"['Domain-independent', 'Dual-image', 'Reversible watermarking', 'Robust Watermarking']",,"Robust reversible watermarking has attracted widespread attention in the field of information hiding in recent years. It should not only have robustness against attacks in transmission but also meet the reversibility of distortion-free transmission. According to our best knowledge, the most recent robust reversible watermarking methods adopt a single image as the carrier, which might lead to low efficiency in terms of carrier utilization. To address the issue, a novel dual-image robust reversible watermarking framework is proposed in this paper to effectively utilize the correlation between both carriers (namely dual images) and thus improve the efficiency of carrier utilization. In the dual-image robust reversible watermarking framework, a two-layer robust watermarking mechanism is designed to further improve the algorithm performances, i.e., embedding capacity and robustness. In addition, an optimization model is built to determine the parameters. Finally, the proposed framework is applied in different domains (namely domain-independent), i.e., Slantlet Transform and Singular Value Decomposition domain, and Zernike moments, respectively to demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed dual-image robust reversible watermarking framework."
Hand Gesture Control for Human–Computer Interaction with Deep Learning,2022,"['Hand gesture', 'Human computer interaction', 'Deep learning', 'Object detection']",,"The use of gesture control has numerous advantages compared to the use of physical hardware. However, it has yet to gain popularity as most gesture control systems require extra sensors or depth cameras to detect or capture the movement of gestures before a meaningful signal can be triggered for corresponding course of action. This research proposes a method for a hand gesture control system with the use of an object detection algorithm, YOLOv3, combined with handcrafted rules to achieve dynamic gesture control on the computer. This project utilizes a single RGB camera for hand gesture recognition and localization. The dataset of all gestures used for training and its corresponding commands, are custom designed by the authors due to the lack of standard gestures specifi cally for human–computer interaction. Algorithms to integrate gesture commands with virtual mouse and keyboard input through the Pynput library in Python, were developed to handle commands such as mouse control, media control, and others. The mAP result of the YOLOv3 model obtained 96.68% accuracy based on testing result. The use of rule-based algorithms for gesture interpretation was successfully implemented to transform static gesture recognition into dynamic gesture."

From an anti-feminist point of view, it was mainly discussed limited to the shape of the consumer, which is the main driving force behind ‘reckless commercialism’ and ‘aesthetic flaws in the work’. However, female readers in the feminist camp were evidence of a new aesthetic trend, a sign of improving women’s social status, and furthermore, a map that determined the direction of the feminist movement.This thesis examines the traces of the women’s liberation literature theory that has discussed women’s liberation literature as a powerful means of women’s liberation movement since the late 1980s. The feminist movement ,which was active from the mid-1980s and continued until the 1990s, was carried out with a plan to positively develop the image of a woman as a transformational subject as the ideal type of female readers. In particular, the differences in the positions of each camp on women’s liberation literature are characteristic of claiming different female readers as well as ideal models of different narratives, characters, and events, and uttering towards them."
New Fault Detection Method for Low Voltage DC Microgrid with Renewable Energy Sources,2022,"['Absolute detail energy', 'DWT', 'Fault detection', 'LVDC microgrid', 'PSCAD']",,"With the development of renewable energy sources (RES), the use of microgrids is becoming more prevalent. The low voltage direct current (LVDC) microgrid provides numerous advantages, including increased convenience, improved efficiency, loss reduction, and simple integration with PV and BESS. There are currently no perfect fault detection methods for LVDC microgrids. Solutions, such as protection relays and coordinates, must be found as soon as possible to reduce costs and provide better quality DC power. This paper proposes a new fault detection method for LVDC microgrid with RES for the development of an effective method. A 1500 Vdc (+ 750 Vdc) LVDC distribution system in South Korea composed of PV, BESS, and load, which are major elements in the LVDC microgrid, was modeled using PSCAD s/w. Further, we developed a fault detection algorithm using various fault analyses. The proposed new fault detection method consists of instantaneous current change rate, the detail coefficient of the discrete wavelet transform, and absolute detail energy. As a result of the simulation and performance verification, the proposed fault detection method demonstrates reliable operation in several cases."
Human Fetal Cartilage-Derived Progenitor Cells Exhibit Anti-Inflammatory Effect on IL-1β-Mediated Osteoarthritis Phenotypes In Vitro,2022,"['Cartilage progenitor cells', 'Anti-inflammation', 'Poly(I-C)', 'Osteoarthritis', 'In vitro']",,"BACKGROUND: In this study, we have investigated whether human fetal cartilage progenitor cells (hFCPCs) have antiinflammatory activity and can alleviate osteoarthritis (OA) phenotypes in vitro.METHODS: hFCPCs were stimulated with various cytokines and their combinations and expression of paracrine factors was examined to find an optimal priming factor. Human chondrocytes or SW982 synoviocytes were treated with interleukin- 1b (IL-1b) to produce OA phenotype, and co-cultured with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I-C))-primed hFCPCs to address their anti-inflammatory effect by measuring the expression of OA-related genes. The effect of poly(I-C) on the surface marker expression and differentiation of hFCPCs into 3 mesodermal lineages was also examined.RESULTS: Among the priming factors tested, poly(I-C) (1 lg/mL) most significantly induced the expression of paracrine factors such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, histocompatibility antigen, class I, G, tumor necrosis factor- stimulated gene- 6, leukemia inhibitory factor, transforming growth factor-b1 and hepatocyte growth factor from hFCPCs. In the OA model in vitro, co-treatment of poly(I-C)-primed hFCPCs significantly alleviated IL-1b-induced expression of inflammatory factors such as IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and IL-1b, and matrix metalloproteinases in SW982, while it increased the expression of cartilage extracellular matrix such as aggrecan and collagen type II in human chondrocytes. We also found that treatment of poly(I-C) did not cause significant changes in the surface marker profile of hFCPCs, while showed some changes in the 3 lineages differentiation.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that poly(I-C)-primed hFCPCs have an ability to modulate inflammatory response and OA phenotypes in vitro and encourage further studies to apply them in animal models of OA in the future."

This is to analyze real-time image information with the object detection and tracking technologies and to obtain manufacturing data. The research team collects object motion information for each frame by applying YOLO (You Only Look Once) and DeepSORT as object detection and tracking algorithms. Thereafter, the motion information is converted into two pieces of manufacturing data (production performance and time) through post-processing. A dynamically moving factory model is created to obtain training data for deep learning. In addition, operating scenarios are proposed to reproduce the shop-floor situation in the real world. The operating scenario assumes a flow-shop consisting of six facilities. As a result of collecting manufacturing data according to the operating scenarios, the accuracy was 96.3%."
GCNXSS: An Attack Detection Approach for Cross-Site Scripting Based on Graph Convolutional Networks,2022,"['Web security', 'Cross-site Scripting', 'Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN)']",,"Since machine learning was introduced into cross-site scripting (XSS) attack detection, many researchers have conducted related studies and achieved significant results, such as saving time and labor costs by not maintaining a rule database, which is required by traditional XSS attack detection methods. However, this topic came across some problems, such as poor generalization ability, significant false negative rate (FNR) and false positive rate (FPR). Moreover, the automatic clustering property of graph convolutional networks (GCN) has attracted the attention of researchers. In the field of natural language process (NLP), the results of graph embedding based on GCN are automatically clustered in space without any training, which means that text data can be classified just by the embedding process based on GCN. Previously, other methods required training with the help of labeled data after embedding to complete data classification. With the help of the GCN auto-clustering feature and labeled data, this research proposes an approach to detect XSS attacks (called GCNXSS) to mine the dependencies between the units that constitute an XSS payload. First, GCNXSS transforms a URL into a word homogeneous graph based on word co-occurrence relationships. Then, GCNXSS inputs the graph into the GCN model for graph embedding and gets the classification results. Experimental results show that GCNXSS achieved successful results with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, FNR, FPR, and predicted time scores of 99.97%, 99.75%, 99.97%, 99.86%, 0.03%, 0.03%, and 0.0461ms. Compared with existing methods, GCNXSS has a lower FNR and FPR with stronger generalization ability."
si-Tgfbr1-loading liposomes inhibit shoulder capsule fibrosis via mimicking the protective function of exosomes from patients with adhesive capsulitis,2022,"['Adhesive capsulitis', 'Rotator cuff tear', 'Circulating exosomes', 'miRNAs', 'Liposomes']",,"Background: Adhesive capsulitis is a common shoulder disorder inducing joint capsule fibrosis and pain. When combined with rotator cuff tear (RCT), treatments can be more complex. Currently, targeted therapy is lacking. Since adhesive capsulitis is reported to be related to circulating materials, we analyzed the contents and biology of circulating exosomes from RCT patients with and without adhesive capsulitis, in an attempt to developing a targeting treatment. Methods: Samples from a consecutive cohort of patients with RCT for surgery were collected. Circulating exosomal miRNAs sequencing were used to detect differentially expressed miRNAs in patients with and without adhesive capsulitis. For experiments in vitro, Brdu staining, CCK-8 assay, wound healing test, collagen contraction test, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot were conducted. Histological and immunofluorescent staining, and biomechanical analysis were applied in a mouse model of shoulder stiffness. The characteristics of liposomes loaded with siRNA were measured via dynamic light scattering or electron microscopy. Results: Circulating exosomal miRNAs sequencing showed that, compared to exosomes from patients without adhesive capsulitis, miR-142 was significantly up-regulated in exosomes from adhesive capsulitis (Exo-S). Both Exo-S and miR-142 could inhibit fibrogenesis, and the anti-fibrotic effect of Exo-S relied on miR-142. The target of miR-142 was proven to be transforming growth factor β receptor 1 (Tgfbr1). Then, liposomes were developed and loaded with si-Tgfbr1. The si-Tgfbr1-loading liposomes exhibited promising therapeutic effect against shoulder stiffness in mouse model with no evidence toxicity. Conclusion: This study showed that, in RCT patients with adhesive capsulitis, circulating exosomes are protective and have anti-fibrotic potential. This effect is related to the contained miR-142, which targets Tgfbr1. By mimicking this biological function, liposomes loaded with si-Tgfbr1 can mitigate shoulder stiffness pre-clinically"

The prophetic voice, often avoided by preachers because of its severity, needs to be heard by the Church today. The significance of preaching on the prophets is highlighted in that the book is the earliest written prophetic text that initiates the prophetic tradition. Furthermore, the prophetic texts serve as a bridge between the Old and New Covenant that is renewd in Christ.The purpose of this study is to propose a homiletic guideline on the eighth-century prophets toward the 21st-century audeience in the light of the prophetic sequence. The Day of Yahweh was proclaimed by the prophets; however, that day was neither the Israelites expected nor what they desired. The day was to be a day of darkness and destruction. The prophets stood squarely in the tradition of Moses and pronounced Istaelite’s sin and warned God’s judgment. While they lamented nation’s demise, they looked forward to the final restoration. This research proposes homiletic methodologies preaching on the eighth-century prophets. The prophetic preachers should; 1) focus on evil beneath the surface of social problems; 2) seek reconciliation in transforming character; 3) preach eschatological “NO” and “YES”; 4) nurture the 21st century remnant to strive for hope. Then the sermonic model that contains homiletic suggestions will be offered."

The book mainly narrates the story of Yohan, who left the Korean Peninsula after the Korean War and came to Brazil seeking a new life.The first part of this paper analyzes the intrusive memories of Yohan induced by the trauma of the Korean War. The intrusive memories are characterized by three aspects: the fixation of war traumatic memory, the interweaving of war memory and childhood memory, and the sensory reproduction of traumatic memory. The second part expounds on the role of time and space shifts in healing Yohan's trauma and the reconciliation between the past and the present.Yohan's gradual relief from Korean War's trauma is mainly reflected in his spatial awareness of North Korea and Brazil. It is also exhibited in, his consciousness of the past and present, -from the confusion and collision of the two pairs at first to the integration and distinct boundaries between them at the end. The third part of this paper discusses how Yohan cast off his subjectivity and integrated himself with the Other  to fight against trauma. The shift in Yohan's focus throughout the novel and the rotation of Yohan's subject and object identity in the process of gift delivery reveal his self-identification and self-transcendence as a mode for him to encounter trauma. The last part explains how Yohan, alienated from his mother tongue, reshapes his psychology and memory while acquiring a new language. With the aid of a new language, Yohan transformed the recent memory into a medium covering the memory of the past, making it difficult for the trauma to survive in the new vision created by this medium.By analyzing the trauma and recovery of the protagonist in Snow Hunters, this paper reveals the author's transnational imagination for war trauma recovery. In the novel, the author places the background of the Korean War in the same narrative space as distant Brazil. He gradually integrates the self  and the Other , transforms the subject and object, and dispels the war trauma in the unified rhythm of different nationalities. Through literary writing, the novel shows the power of a community in reducing the discrepancies between nations, whereby humankind can jointly resist trauma."

The celadon stools were designated and managed as treasures due to their high art-historical value in the form of demonstrating the excellence of celadon manufacturing techniques and the fanciful lifestyles during the Goryeo Dynasty. However, one of the items, which appeared to have been repaired and restored in the past, suffered a decline in aesthetic value due to the aging of the treatment materials and the lack of skill on the part of the conservator, raising the need for re-treatment as a result of structural instability. An examination of the conservation condition prior to conservation treatment found structural vulnerabilities because physical damage had been artificially inflicted throughout the area that was rendered defective at the time of manufacturing. The bonded surfaces for the cracked areas and detached fragments did not fit, and these areas and fragments had deteriorated because the adhesive trickled down onto the celadon surface or secondary contaminants, such as dust, were on the adhesive surface. The study identified the position, scope, and conditions of the bonded areas at the cracks UV rays and microscopy in order to investigate the condition of repair and restoration. By conducting Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR) and portable x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy on the materials used for the former conservation treatment, the study confirmed the use of cellulose resins and epoxy resins as adhesives. Furthermore, the analysis revealed the addition of gypsum(CaSO4·2H2O) and bone meal(Ca10 (PO4)6(OH)2) to the adhesive to increase the bonding strength of some of the bonded areas that sustained force. Based on the results of the investigation, the conservation treatment for the artifact would focus on completely dismantling the existing bonded areas and then consolidating vulnerable areas through bonding and restoration. After removing and dismantling the prior adhesive used, the celadon stool was separated into 6 large fragments including the top and bottom, the curved legs, and some of the ring design. After dismantling, the remaining adhesive and contaminants were chemically and physically removed, and a steam cleaner was used to clean the fractured surfaces to increase the bonding efficacy of the re-bonding. The bonding of the artifact involved applying the adhesive differently depending on the bonding area and size. The cyanoacrylate resin Loctite 401 was used on the bonding area that held the positions of the fragments, while the acrylic resin Paraloid B-72 20%(in xylene) was treated on cross sections for reversibility in the areas that provided structural stability before bonding the fragments using the epoxy resin Epo-tek 301-2. For areas that would sustain force, as in the top and bottom, kaolin was added to Epo-tek 301-2 in order to reinforce the bonding strength. For the missing parts of the ring design where a continuous pattern could be assumed, a frame was made using SN-sheets, and the ring design was then modeled and restored by connecting the damaged cross section with Wood epos. Other restoration areas that occurred during bonding were treated by being filled with Wood epos for aesthetic and structural stabilization. Restored and filled areas were color-matched to avoid the feeling of disharmony from differences of texture in case of exhibitions in the future. The investigation and treatment process involving a variety of scientific technology was systematically documented so as to be utilized as basic data for the conservation and maintenance."

It is estimated that it has been used since the Three Kingdoms period, and is mainly excavated along with various burial items from tombs after the Goryeo period.However, archaeological research on scissors is quite inexperienced, so it is hardly used to reveal life in the past. Even today, the scissors excavated from the ruins are either omitted or briefly introduced in the category of household ironware or women's items. It is thought that this is because, in the end, due to the lack of research, various archaeological discussions that can be developed through scissors were not presented.Therefore, as part of the basic research on scissors, I tried to focus on understanding the precedence and posterior relationship along with the formal classification of relics, and to briefly look at the development of scissors.In Korea, three types of scissors were used: 'Ribbon-shaped', '8-shaped', and 'X-shaped'. Among them, the 8-shaped scissors are in the shape of the shoulder and blade, X-shaped scissors were considered to reflect the timing as significant changes in the appearance were found in the shape of the handle.Scissors of each type were mainly used during the Three Kingdoms period, North-South states period-Goryeo period, and Goryeo-Joseon period, respectively. However, unlike today's various types of scissors, which are used together according to their use, in the past, when the next type of scissors appeared, it seems that the previous type of scissors was not used anymore. This type of transformation is clearly observed from the end of the Goryeo to the early Joseon period.In addition, Korean scissors were found to have a close relationship with Chinese scissors. This is because many similarities arefound in the model composition, transition process, and time of use of the scissors.Although it was not possible to come to a more specific conclusion due to the limitations of the data, if more cases of excavation of scissors accumulate in the future and related studies progress, it will be possible to understand the full story of the transition of scissors more clearly."

However, it was Russia where Nietzsche’s ideas had the greatest repercussion. It is a well-known fact that Nietzsche had a tremendous influence on Russian culture, literature and thought at the Silver Age.Nietzsche’s ideas were introduced into Russia in the early 1890s. Nietzsche’s influence on Russian thought that started from this time gradually increased and reached its peak in 1914 when World War I broke out. This thesis examines the acceptance of Nietzsche in Russia, especially Nikolai Grot’s interpretation of Nietzsche published in 1893, which is the initial stage of acceptance of Nietzsche. To this end, it was first examined how the ideological topography at the time Russia accepted Nietzsche had an effect on acceptance and interpretation of Nietzsche in Russia, and in this context, the cause and result of Nikolai Grot's interpretation of Nietzsche were to be derived.Although there are many studies of Nietzsche by Russian philosophers and writers, the reason for paying attention to Grot’s interpretation of Nietzsche is as follows. The first is that it is the first study in Russia to compare Nietzsche with other Russian thinkers. Grot contrasts Tolstoy’s Christian altruism with Nietzsche’s anti-Christian individualism in his thesis. The second is that Grot’s interpretation of Nietzsche through comparison with Tolstoy became a model for later acceptance of Nietzsche’s ideas in Northeast Asia.The unique spiritual and historical characteristics of Russia at the end of the 19th century became the basis for creating discourse of Nietzscheanism and Tolstoyanism, and this discourse structure, which was later transmitted to Northeast Asia via Japan, is transformed and accepted in each country’s situation. In this way, a huge map of Nietzsche acceptance in Northeast Asia was formed."

H철H의 서사가 가시화된 지역으로는 소설이 유비 적으로 그려보인 산업사가 실제적으로 펼쳐진 부산이 적절해 보인다. 부산은 조 선산업의 도시였고, 오늘날 커피산업으로 도시를 유지하고자 욕망한다. 부산이 커피산업의 인프라를 구축하고자 시도한다는 것은 커피산업을 통해 도시의 인프 라 자체를 재구축하겠다는 의지이며, 이는 재구축될 자리에 앞서 있던 어떤 인 프라가 문제를 일으켰기 때문으로 볼 수 있다.트러블과 함께 존재하는 부산의 인프라는 몇 겹의 레이어를 지닌다. 그 레이 어 내부에는 생태와 경제를 잇는 위기 시대의 관계적 인프라로서 ‘재첩’이 있었 다. 재첩잡이를 통한 생계의 양상은 ‘구제(salvage)’라는 개념을 통해 이해할 수 있다. 서부산 주민들의 회고는 이러한 구제 활동이 다양한 크래프트를 통해 이루어지고 있었음을 증명한다. 생태적-장인적 실천으로서의 크래프트는 주민들 이 그들의 살아 있는 경험을 스스로 이해할 수 있도록 하며, 물질성에 환원할 수 없는 방법으로 체현과 지식 사이의 연결을 긍정한다. 그리고 크래프트는 구 제를 통해 정동적 축적(affective accumulation)을 통해 어소시에이션을 만 든다. 그러나 크래프트를 발동시킨 재첩이라는 커먼즈는 공단과 하굿둑이라는 산업적 인프라에 의해 붕괴되었다. 이는 정동적 관계의 붕괴다.오늘날 공단은 다시 한번 카페로 그 모습을 바꾸어가고 있고, 부산은 ‘커피도 시’로의 변신을 꿈꾼다. 산업사회의 접속력에 다름 아닌 크래프트를 전제에 둔 어소시에이션은 플랫폼화된 커피도시에서 기능적 역할에 따라 분리되고, 이에 따라 어소시에이션은 개인으로 해체되어 커피의 소비자 또는 생산자로 결정(화) 된다. 독립적이고 자율적인 소비자 또는 기업가적인 생산자로서의 정체성은 플 랫폼 모델이 그 성공과 실패에 대한 책임을 개인에게 전가하는 경로이다.","Kim Sum’s novel Iron (2008) is a bio-political narrative that focuses on conflict within the “Animacy Hierarchy.” This conflict is not a conflict over the scientific classification of the organic body, but rather derives from the discriminatory and exclusionary classifications concerning what a body does and can do. Kim Sum’s Iron is not just a universal history of industrial capitalism. Rather, it can also be read as a work of realism. As an industrialized city, Busan is a fitting setting for the story and its depiction of industrial history. Formerly sustained by its shipbuilding industry, Busan is now trying to develop itself into a base for the coffee industry to revitalize its infrastructure.Busan’s infrastructure and its problems have multiple layers. Among these layers are “clams,” which are a relational infrastructure in an era of crisis, connecting ecology and economy. Maintaining one’s livelihood through clam digging can be understood through the term “salvage.” The recollections of citizens of western Busan prove that these salvage practices are maintained through a diverse set of craft skills. Craft as an ecological, artisanal practice enables residents to understand their experiences and affirms the connection between experience and knowledge in a way that cannot be reduced to materiality. However, the commons that sustained clam digging was destroyed by the industrial infrastructure of industrial parks and estuarine dams.Currently, industrial parks are being converted into cafés, and Busan dreams of transforming itself into a “coffee city.” Associations based on the premise of craft, which corresponds to the connectivity of industrial society, are separated according to their functional role in a platformized coffee city, and accordingly, the association is dismantled as an individual is determined or crystallizes as a consumer or producer of coffee. The identity of an independent and autonomous consumer or entrepreneurial producer is the path through which the platform model places responsibility for its success and failure on the individual."

It is seen that such a phenomenon originates from the clash between liberalism and democracy within liberal democracy. To confirm this, I briefly review the process in which the phase of democracy has changed within the theoretical tradition of liberalism. For classical liberal theorists such as Tocqueville, Hobbes and Locke, the notions of democracy and equality have only the secondary importance compared to the notion of liberty containing the implication of supporting a market economy based on the guarantee of private property rights. And democracy can be seen as a dangerous thing that might suppress freedom through tyranny of the majority. Since the 19th century, the liberal democracy theorists such as Jeremy Bentham and James Mill seem to have expressed a more positive view of democracy by claiming for universal suffrage. However, even for them, the most important reason for supporting democracy has lain in the protection of property rights. They saw social inequality as inevitable. J. S. Mill can be seens as a more active supporter of democracy in that he understood that citizenship could grow by participating in the political process democratically. But just like Tocqueville, he shows a regressive attitude of suggesting plural voting as a result of distrusting the intellectual level of the laboring masses and worrying about tyranny of the mass. The new political rationality being disseminated in the neoliberal era is resolving this dilemma within the liberal tradition by transforming the meanings of freedom and democracy into the domination of market rationality. These political theories and ideologies of our times are directing toward the gradual reduction of political freedom of citizens. This can never be the final state of completed democracy. We must not give up the possibility of a better democratic society. The ideally completed model of a desirable democracy cannot exist in reality. The model for future society would be found in the process of thinking about and improving the current deficiencies."

It can be seen that contemporary Korean society demands the succession of the movement, which has already been developed in various forms. Looking at the the Korean Protestant Monastery, the following meanings can be drawn from the ethical and missionary aspects. First, it is worth paying attention to the aspect of the monastic movement, which is connected with public theology. From the perspective of the Korean Protestant Monastery Movement, since it has historically transformed churches and society, the significance of its existence can be highly evaluated in public theology. As Korean Protestantism has played an important role during the Enlightenment period, the Japanese colonial era, the Korean War, and the economic development process, the monastic movement has also participated as an part of Protestant church. Second, the monastic movement can be a typical model for realizing community ethics in contrast to individualism. Historically, monasteries have existed as Christian institutions that find expression in both very personal and communal - paradoxical - form. Community ethics in monastery movement is not separated from social issues and rather emphasizes various virtues and unique biblical narratives. Third, the monastic movement focuses on the formation of spirituality that James Smith and others call “the liturgy”. Spaces of the liturgy that actually affect many people have the ethical and theological characteristics by being constructed on the worldview. Liturgical acts can be found in many areas around us, and the importance of monasteries needs to be emphasized as a space for spiritual formation."

Using such a perspective, this study describes the hierarchical structure that forms between classes or socio-economic groups within individual growth regimes, and also systematically explains how structural changes in power relationships between socio-economic groups occur when other structural changes take place from one growth regime to another. Using this perspective of dependence and balancing, this study confirms that from the period of Fordism to the period of Finance-led growth regime, the dependence relationships between labor, manager, and finance were transformed, resulting in a reversal of power relationships and hierarchy.

Although the animal style art has been regarded as the representative and prevalent art style in many ancient nomadic cultures that originated in their natural environment, many scholars have contradictorily wanted to interpret the meaning of their characters and the manufactural regions as a result of the advanced cultural influences from the giant neighboring imperial states like ancient Persia or China. However, there are many disputes on the meaning and stylistic features of the “animal style” art in ancient Eurasian continent. In this paper, I classified the animals in the ancient Central Asian artifacts into two basic categories: animals that exist in the real world and fantastic animals that exist in the imaginations of the humans. In my opinion, the imaginary animals are more significant as those creatures might be the hybrids envisioned from varied features of several real-life animals to visually represent special, invisible, supernatural, or mythical existences.In this paper, I will research on the iconographic features and cultural meaning of the fantastic animals in ancient Xiongnu artifacts, which were made in the later period of the ancient Central Asian animal style arts. These fantastic animals can be classified into four groups according to their zoomorphic features. The first group is related to the so-called Chinese dragon or serpent. The second group is related to the griffin or a monstrous vulture. The third group is related to feline-like beasts. The last group is related to the animal with one horn, or so-called unicorn. However, every fantastic animal in ancient Xiongnu artifacts reveals varied appearance and it is difficult to find similarities between them. Additionally, there are diverse visual transformations among the same groups based on the excavated regions. Many fantastic animals in Xiongnu artifacts are represented as a part of the “animal combat” scenes, but several examples are represented solely as themselves. The most important sole iconographic image is the winged animal with a horn, which was a new fantastic animal in Xiongnu culture excavated from Gol Mod II site in 2011. In Mongolia, this fantastic animal is called “Bers,” a kind of mythical animal in ancient Xiongnu culture. This fantastic animal is an original Mongolian creature in ancient Xiongnu period.In the previous studies on the fantastic animals portrayed in ancient Xiongnu period, many scholars have strictly focused only on the influence of Han Chinese culture, disregarding the cultural and regional originalities of Xiongnu people and the traditionalism in the ancient nomadic culture. However, the material culture of Xiongnu people shows the diverse and vast interrelationships and exchanges across the entire Eurasian continent to the contemporary Egypt in the north of Africa. It means that the cultural interpretation on the Xiongnu culture must be a much wider view of the ancient nomadic culture than the narrow view of the ancient Chinese historical records written by the Chinese who might have been complete outsiders among the Xiongnu and ancient nomads. The famous fantastic animal from Gol Mod II site bears no relationship to the contemporary Han China, but it might have originated from the ancient Near East and Persia. According to the zoomorphic features, the animal iconography might be related to the ancient Near Eastern fantastic animal named “Lion-Griffin,” but the style is originally created in ancient Mongolia with many eccentric variations. In my opinion, this newly created fantastic animal of Gol Mod II site might be the antecedent model of “Simurgh,” the famous fantastic animal in the late Persian myth and culture.The fantastic animal in the ancient Xiongnu period in Mongolia had represented d..."

Since the early Joseon Dynasty, Hyojado Folding Screen has been produced by the royal family for the education of the crown prince and used as a gift to the people who practiced filial piety. In addition, it was made as a genealogy commemorating the royal event, so it was possible to confirm the diversity of use.  These works can be largely classified into 《효자도병풍(folding screen of filial piety, hyojado byeongpung)》, which inherited the royal court painting style, and 《hyojado byeongpung》, which was transformed and developed based on the 『Oryun Haengsildo』 published in the Jeongjo Dynasty. In the case of 《hyojado byeongpung》, which inherited the royal style of painting, there is an icon that serves as a model like the collection of Leeum and Wonkwang University Museum discussed this time. In the case of the Leeum collection, the folk museum collection, and the personal collection(3), it seems that the same series of icons were used. The collection of Wonkwang University Museum is considered to be a work that shares the same iconography as a personal collection(1)(2), the collection of the Gyeonggi University Museum, and the collection of the Onyang Folk Museum. The works that inherited this style of royal painting were continuously produced until the first half of the 20th century, and the collection of Wonkwang University Museum is a work that confirms it. In addition, many of the works based on 『Oryun Haengsildo』 were those that copied the basic icon as it is, and some that emphasized the decorative effect by adding more landscape and landscape backgrounds. There were paintings that emphasized only important scenes of filial piety, and paintings that accommodated other materials such as flowers and birds in scenes of filial piety.  The production of these various 《hyojado byeongpung》 may be related to the purpose of its use. Although the educational function of filial piety, which is the most basic in Joseon, which advocates Confucianism, takes precedence in 《hyojado byeongpung》, I think that the desire to nurture filial piety worked from the point of view of private consumers. In the Joseon Dynasty, by practicing filial piety and raising filial piety, the aristocrats and the common people could receive the glory of the family and the benefits of real life. Therefore, it is thought that the Hyojado Folding Screen, which depicts filial piety that can be imitated in Joseon society, has been steadily produced as a visual material that has been useful for children’s education.",

Among Japanese historians of the colonial historiography of Korea, Takahashi, who stood out as an exception in his delving into the realm of thought and philosophy, valued “spirit” as the source of outward phenomena, through which he tried to define the national characteristics of Korea. In doing so, he expanded the scope of his research from language and literature to Confucianism, Buddhism, and new religions. The discourse of sadaejuui, which was the conclusion he reached, constituted his attempt to construct a philosophical discourse of sadaejuui distinct from the political discourse of sadaejuui more commonly discussed at the time. In so doing, the thrust of the argument he ultimately intended lay in the spiritual foreign dependency of Korean thought, rather than its unoriginality, as it was commonly articulated. This indicated an eternally unchanging nature that would reemerge time and again while merely changing its object of dependency, switching from China in the past to the U.S. at the time, even as it would continue to shift elsewhere in the future. In that sense, Takahashi’s discourse of sadaejuui resists equation with Sinophilism based on an admiration for Chinese civilization in and of itself. Rather, in English, its meaning is more closely aligned with the term “dependency” than “Sinocentrism.” However, while the discourse appears to emerge as a result of inductive reasoning, it in fact originated in a deductive approach which took as its starting point “Japan’s unique culture and thought” as the exemplary model it had in mind. As such, he argues that Korea failed to transform foreign ideas from an autonomous perspective so as to successfully synthesize them because, unlike Japan, it lacked a national body or structure of state (J. kokutai) which, in his view, led to its subordination to Japan."

For this purpose, this thesis focuses on Ambrose of the Milan Church, who had an influnence comparable to the Roman Church in the 4th century, and analyzes his sacramntal theology showing the connection and difference with philosophical thought. This study specifically investigates how Neoplatonism influenced Ambrose or how Ambrose dealt with Neoplatonism.  Ambrose’s explanation of sacramental theology gives the impression that he is recalling the subjects and terms dealt with in the Platonic tradition, specifically, in the Neo-Platonic thought. The factors appearing in Neoplatonic thoughts of Plotin and Porphyry, ‘acension of soul’, ‘selfconsciousness’, ‘awareness of God through self-looking’, ‘similarity’ and ‘prison of soul’ can be seen as overlapping images in education to remind of the meaning of the sacraments. The overlapping factors appeared in the parable of the ascension of the ealge based on Psalm 105:5, the explanation of the similarity of death in Romans 6:5, and the explanation of where Christ dwells based on Matthew 25:6.  Ambrose did not use these elements of Neoplatonic thought indiscriminately in sacramental theology. He did not combine Christian truth with Neoplatonic thought and transform it into something new. Wenn Neoplatonic thought discussed the ‘ascension of soul’, Ambrose went one step further and explained the ‘incompetence of soul’. Wenn ‘self-consciousness’ was discussed in Neoplatonic thought, Ambrose spoke about ‘awareness of sin’ and ‘self-identity as a new creature’. In addition, the schema of ‘model and prototype’ of Neoplatonic thought appeared as a schema of ‘exemplary and actual’ (figura et veritas) to Ambrose, and ‘eye’ in Neoplatonic thought was expressed in terms of ‘mind’ to Ambrose. He knew the factors of Neoplatonic thought, and he knew the limits of it. Therefore, he did not identify Neoplatonic thought with Christian truth, but rather explained the core truth of Christianity using the framework of Platonic thought. This is found in the fact that he did not actively accept anything that was contrary to Neoplato’s thought and maintained the original form of Christian truth."

Meanwhile, as China went through the New-Culture Movement and the May Fourth Movement, modern sciences and thoughts were flooded in China, and mass public movements dramatically arose daily. Li Yunjae as a foreign student in China published his articles regarding on Chinese Character Revolution, Mongolian Independence Movement, political history of the Republic of China, student movements, labor movements, literature revolution, trends of public opinion, and so on, so he helped Koreans’ understanding China and their pursuing methods for saving their country. As he paid his attention to New Culture Movement emphasizing Chinese Character Revolution, and as he held up and introduced the Cultural Revolution of Hu Shi, he stimulated Korea’s Verbal-written Language Unity Movement, and emphasized the history of Chinese dramas as a method of sinology. As he supported China’s patriotic movements, he evaluated the May Fourth Movement as the most honorable popular movement in history, and defended the freedom of assembly and association and seriously considered human rights. As he supported China’s patriotic movements, he evaluated the May Fourth Movement as the most honorable popular movement in history, and defended the freedom of assembly and association and seriously considered human rights. Like such ways, Yi Yunjae, regardless of his major field, was strongly influenced by contemporary Chinese New Culture Movement and popular movements, and circulated them in Korea through mass-media.Right after coming back to Korea, Yi Yunjae participated into educational, academical, and journalistic activities. As he studied modern history, he wrote a lot of historic essays and historic stories, through which he excavated historic figures in order to find leadership for his colonized homeland. Also, he put his efforts in educating general public about his homeland’s history. He emphasized the perpetuality and excellency of his nation’s history, and the historical lesson of historical heroes resisting foreign invasions. Yi Yunjae also led the Hangeul Movement; as he was influenced by the Chinese Literary Revolution, he asserted systematic usage and standardization of Hangeul and participated in compiling a Hangeul dictionary. He was cautious about reckless acceptance of western thoughts, emphasized moral and ethical cultivations, such as self and mutual reliance for the first step to overcome the colonized reality. He highly regarded Dan-gun history and Gaecheonjeol not to forget the national origin, and especially highlighted ‘hongyikyingan’ and ‘jaeseyihwa’. With his strong nationalist tendency, Yi Yunjae mastered scientific methodologies and modern academic thoughts through studying in Beijing, got interested not only in his class works but also in state of affairs, and devised the way to save his homeland through educational and journalistic activities. Yi Yunjae’s educational and journalistic activities were the combination and transformation of the modern knowledge and western thoughts attained by studying in Beijing and of nationalism. He was a model of the intellectual activist."

U²Net-based Single-pixel Imaging Salient Object Detection,2022,"['Fourier transform', 'Salient object detection', 'Single-pixel imaging']",,"At certain wavelengths, single-pixel imaging is considered to be a solution that can achieve high quality imaging and also reduce costs. However, achieving imaging of complex scenes is an overhead-intensive process for single-pixel imaging systems, so low efficiency and high consumption are the biggest obstacles to their practical application. Improving efficiency to reduce overhead is the solution to this problem.

These changes are made possible by the use of new technologies invented in the automobile in each era, broadening the scope of design applicable to automobiles.In transition to an electric car system with motors, more advanced technologies have been incorporated into the automobile industry, and new technologies that will emerge in the near future will change the car’s exterior design differently from what it is now. Therefore, research is needed to analyze and predict these changes. This paper aims to provide feature analysis and propose designs for changes in the exterior design of near-future commercial electric sedans.The research method and process referred to the relevant thesis data to macroscopically summarize the technologies applied from the beginning of automobiles to the present and the changes in appearance accordingly. In addition, the scope of the commercial sedan’s exterior design was narrowed down to organize important design elements in the sedan exterior design and analyzed the change elements based on technological development. Representative elements of change were analyzed as examples of Mercedes-Benz’s two sedan models, and the design trends of other automobile brands were compared and contrasted to provide a basis for the argument. In addition, based on the derived design trend, a new external design was proposed for commercial electric sedans in the near future. In addition, ideas that can be applied to the expanded greenhouse were proposed together by combining them with newly announced screen technology, and other character line location changes were also proposed. So, These design changes are expected to significantly change the exterior design of near-future commercial electric sedans. Finally, through this study, it is expected to be of little help to research automobile design trends."

The behavior of these aerosols iscrucial to estimate the in-containment source term as a part of nuclear reactor safety analysis. In thiswork, the evolution of sodium aerosol characteristics (mass concentration and size) is simulated usingHAARM-S code. The code is based on the method of moments to solve the integro-differential equation.The code is updated to FORTRAN-77 and run in Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation 4.0 (on Desktop). Thesodium aerosol characteristics simulated by HAARM-S code are compared with the measured values atAerosol Test Facility. The maximum deviation between measured and simulated mass concentrations is30% at initial period (up to 60 min) and around 50% in the later period. In addition, the influence ofhumidity on aerosol size growth for two different aerosol mass concentrations is studied. The measuredand simulated growth factors of aerosol size (ratio of saturated size to initial size) are found to bematched at reasonable extent. Since sodium is highly reactive with atmospheric constituents, the aerosolgrowth factor depends on the hygroscopic growth, chemical transformation and density variations besides coagulation. Further, there is a scope for the improvement of the code to estimate the aerosoldynamics in confined environment"

In the late 1960s, some artists began a campaign against plans to demolish it, which lead to the conception and development of Industriekultur as the German counterpart to the concept of “industrial heritage.” Based on field research and related literature, this study examines it through four categories: mining architecture, social movement, museum, and exhibition concepts. De-industrialization requires a restructuring of the economy, urban spaces, and lifestyles. A social movement against such changes in urban spaces, caused by de-industrialization, began in the Ruhr area. It was aided by social and political upheavals in the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in the successful institutionalization of Industriekutlur. Th is led to the transformation of the Zollern colliery into a museum depicting the social and cultural history of miners. Despite criticisms for its de-politicization of industrial heritage, the Zollern remains a core institution (re)presenting labor in the historical context."

The problem with Korean universities is that basic science becomes weaker in the restructuring process. To solve this problem, we should understand that basic science is closely related to general education in undergraduate education. The way to solve this issue is to establish an independent academic structure to be responsible for general and liberal education, so called “Korean Liberal Arts College”. Among a few versions of the “Korean Liberal Arts College”, the National General (Liberal) Education College in the context of University System Innovation debate is proposed as a college that will provide undergraduate courses in the university system. This college will be evolved to be responsible for the general (liberal) education in undergraduate courses at the national level."
입체 유닛조형의 시각적 효과에 관한 연구 : 사각형 및 육각형 유닛의 플렉서블 디자인 패턴(FDP) 효과 검증을 중심으로,2022,"['플렉서블 디자인 패턴', '입체 유닛조형', '시각적 효과', 'Flexible Design Pattern', 'Cubic Unit Modelling', 'Visual Effect']","본고는 육각형 및 사각형 유닛 기반의 입체유닛 개발과 이의 인상조사를 통해 ‘플렉서블 디자인 패턴(Flexible Design Pattern : 이하 FDP라 칭함)’의 시각적 효과를 객관적으로 검토하여, FDP의 생성원리 및 디자인지침을 제안한 것이다. 결과적으로 피험자 76명을 대상으로 한 인상평가를 통해 육각형은 물론 사각형 유닛기반의 입체패턴에서도 FDP효과가 발생된다는 것을 밝혔다. 여기서 FDP효과의 생성은 첫째, 중첩시 나타나는 대소 셀의 형상 및 크기차이. 둘째, 유닛 전개의 규칙성 유무에 의해 좌우된다는 형상 원칙을 도출하고, 세부적인 디자인 지침(①대소 셀 형상은 대칭성 유무로 구분하여 디자인한다. ②대소 셀이 중첩됨으로써 나타날 수 있는 예상치 못한 형상을 감안하여 셀의 입체형상은 돌기형으로 디자인하며 높이 차이를 둔다. ③대소 셀의 중첩 및 배치에 있어 다양한 대칭적 조작을 통해 변화와 질서를 조율한다. ④대소 셀을 중첩시 셀의 형상 및 크기차이를 조율하면서 배치시킨다.)을 제안했다. 결국 FDP는 셀 및 유닛이 중첩되면서 최소단위가 되는 형태소가 기존 셀의 형상과는 전혀 다른 모습으로 변형되고, 대칭적 형태 및 대칭적 반복조작에 의해 생성되는 질서와 융합되면서 변화와 질서가 어우러진 미의 수준으로 발전되는 것이라고 사료된다.","This paper suggests generation principle & design guideline of FDP by objectively examining visual effect of Flexible Design Pattern(hereinafter referred to as FDP) through cubic unit development of hexagonal & square unit base & investigation of its physiognomy. Consequently, it is disclosed that FDP effect also arises in cubic pattern based on not only hexagonal but also square unit through evaluation of 76 subjects’ physiognomy. Here, the generation of FDP effect draws out: first, shape of large & small cells appearing in superposition and difference in their sizes, second, figure principle that figure depends on existence/unexistence of regularity of unit expansion. Then, it designs by detailed design guideline (① The shape of large & small cell is designed by dividing existence/unexistence of symmetry. ② The cubic shape of cell is designed in protuberance to make difference of height by considering unexpected shape which may appear by superposition of large & small cell. ③ In case that large & small cell is superposed or placed, variation & order is tuned through diverse symmetrical manipulation. ④ In case that large & small cell is superposed, layout is done by tuning cell shape & size.) Eventually, it is thought that FDP harmonizes with order that is generated by symmetrical shape & symmetrical repetitious manipulation and develops to the level of beauty as morpheme that becomes the least unit when cell & unit superposes and is transformed to shape which is completely different from the shape of existing cell."

코로나19 팬데믹 이후 소상공인의 유통 환경 변화와 대응 방안,2022,"['코로나19 팬데믹', '유통 4.0', '디지털 전환', '유통환경 변화', '소상공인', '유통정책', 'Covid19 pandemic', 'Retail 4.0', 'Digital transformation', 'Retail market surroundings', 'Small Businesses', 'Policy options']","코로나바이러스감염증-19, 코로나19가 팬데믹으로 전 세계에 확산되면서 정치·경제·사회·문화 전 분야에 많은 영향을 주었다. 이에 따라 국내에서는 2020년 3월부터 코로나19 방역 정책을 시작했고, 이 과정에서 소상공인과 자영업자들의 피해가 발생해왔다. 그런데 코로나19의 발생과는 별개로 이미 4차 산업혁명과 유통4.0의 변화가 이미 소상공인, 중소기업, 자영업자 등 취약한 경제주체에 영향을 미치고 있었다.본 연구는 우리나라 소상공인의 경영환경과 유통환경의 변화에 대해 2차 자료를 중심으로 분석하여 코로나19 이후에 소상공인의 번영을 위해 필요한 정책이 무엇인지를 탐색하였다. 또, 코로나19 팬데믹 이전과 이후의 뉴스 데이터를 분석하여 소상공인과 자영업자를 위한 정부의 정책이 무엇인지도 규명하였다. 그 결과, 코로나19 팬데믹과 무관하게 소상공인과 자영업자들은 유통시스템의 진화 과정에서 상권쇠퇴, 경쟁심화, 비용의 증가 등으로 어려움을 겪고 있다는 사실을 알 수 있었다. 코로나19 팬데믹은 소상공인들이 이미 대면하고 있던 경영환경 및 유통환경 변화의 속도를 높였을 뿐이며, 소상공인을 위한 정책 방안은 코로나19 팬데믹과 무관하게 4차 산업혁명과 유통 4.0에 따른 변화에 대응하는 것이 필요하다는 것이었다.그리고 다음과 같이 몇 가지 정책을 제언하게 되었다. 먼저, 소상공인의 디지털 전환을 지원해야 한다. 이미‘한국판 뉴딜 종합계획’에는 소상공인이게 온라인 판로 지원과 스마트화가 포함되어 있다. 다만, 코로나19 팬데믹을 겪으면서 빨라진 디지털화, 비대면화에 맞는 신속한 정책적 지원이 필요한 것이다. 둘째, 자생력을 강화하기 위해 마케팅 지원, 특히 판로 확보가 이루어져야 한다. 소상공인들의 자생력은 궁극적으로 매출과 이익이 있어야 보장되게 된다. 따라서 마케팅 역량을 강화하고, 최대한의 유통 채널을 확보할 수 있도록 소상공인 중심의 디지털 유통 플랫폼의 확보가 필요하다. 셋째, 소상공인, 자영업자, 골목상권, 전통시장 등 대상에 맞는 맞춤형 비즈니스 모델을 개발해야 할 것이다. 단순히 이들을 위한 지원이 아니라, 모두가 참여해서 비용을 줄이고 발생하는 이익을 공유할 수 있는 새로운 비즈니스 모델을 개발하는 것이다. 마지막으로, 단기적으로는 코로나19 팬데믹의 방역과정에서 발생한 손실 보상과 지원도 시급한 것이다. 전술한 바와 같이 코로나19 팬데믹이 소상공인 등의 경영 및 유통 환경의 변화를 가속화시키면서 동시에 생존 여력을 현저히 저하시킨 점에 주목해야하기 때문이다.",
