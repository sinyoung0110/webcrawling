Random Forest를 활용한 산사태 피해 영향인자 평가: 충주시 산사태를 중심으로,2024,"['landslide damage area', 'variable importance', 'random forest', 'frequency ratio', '산사태 피해면적', '변수 중요도', '랜덤포레스트', '빈도비율']",,"Landslides are natural disasters that causes significant property damage worldwide every year. In Korea, damage due to landslides is increasing owing to the effects of climate change, and it is important to identify the factors that increase the prevalence of landslides in order to reduce the damage they cause. Therefore, this study used a random forest model to analyze the importance of 14 factors in influencing landslide damage in a specific area of Chungju, Chungcheongbuk-do province, Korea. The random forest model performed accurately with an AUC of 0.87 and the most-important factors were ranked in the order of aspect, slope, distance to valley, and elevation, suggesting that topographic factors such as aspect and slope more greatly influence landslide damage than geological or soil factors such as rock type and soil thickness. The results of this study are expected to provide a basis for mapping and predicting landslide damage, and for research focused on reducing landslide damage."
Random Forest를 이용한 자세 분류 알고리즘,2024,"['앉은 자세 분류', '랜덤 포레스트', '영상 처리', '변수 중요도', '가중치', 'Sitting posture', 'Random forest', 'Image process', 'Variable importance', 'Weight']",,"As computer usage time increases, many people experience neck and back ailments due to poor sitting posture. To prevent these ailments, various methods have been proposed, including research on classifying posture through video recordings and measuring posture by attaching sensors to the body or clothing. However, existing studies still have limitations such as the data acquisition environment, low accuracy, and limited posture classification. To address these limitations, this study proposes a method to classify postures that negatively affect the health of modern individuals, including forward head posture, reclining posture, leaning to the left, leaning to the right, and correct posture. In the proposed method, videos are recorded from the front, and the face and shoulders are detected to calculate coordinates and angles. The importance of five variables is then measured to assign weights to these variables, and they are applied to a random forest algorithm to classify postures. Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved 98% accuracy and demonstrated optimal performance compared to existing studies using video data."

Therefore, there is a need to establish improvement measures that reflect the domestic situation. Method: Using Random Forest, accident severity analysis was conducted on data from accidents occurring on 10 specific routes with high accident rates among national highways from 2019 to 2021. Factors influencing accident severity were identified. Result: The analysis of the top 10 variable importance using the SHAP package revealed that among highway traffic accidents, the variables with a significant impact on accident severity are the age of the perpetrator being between 20 and less than 39 years, the time period being daytime (06:00-18:00), occurrence on weekends (Sat-Sun), seasons being summer and winter, violation of traffic regulations (failure to comply with safe driving), road type being a tunnel, geometric structure having a high number of lanes and a high speed limit. A total of 10 independent variables were found to have a positive correlation with highway traffic accident severity. Conclusion: As accidents on highways occur due to the complex interaction of various factors, predicting accidents poses significant challenges. However, utilizing the results obtained from this study, there is a need for in-depth analysis of the factors influencing the severity of highway traffic accidents. Efforts should be made to establish efficient and rational response measures based on the findings of this research."

Consequently, research on SM monitoring has been actively conducted both domestically and internationally. In this study, a high-resolution (10m) SM estimation model for the Yeongsan River watershed was developed using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the European Space Agency and the Random Forest (RF) method. The model was trained and validated with SAR imagery from May 2015 to August 2023 and SM data collected from four ground observation sites. Statistical verification was conducted for the estimated values. Statistical analysis of the Sentinel-1 and RF-based SM model estimates against independent observed data yielded a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.75 and an index of agreement of 0.83, indicating significant statistical performance. For further validation, the high-resolution SM estimates were used to calculate watershed-averaged SM and compared with precipitation data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5-Land and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)/ Sentinel-1 SM data. The validation results showed an increase in watershed-averaged SM estimates in response to precipitation events (R = 0.30). Additionally, when comparing the watershed-averaged SM estimates derived from the model and those from SMAP/Sentinel-1 with site observed data, the model (R = 0.37) demonstrated higher accuracy than SMAP/Sentinel-1 (R = 0.28). Seasonally, the highest watershed-averaged SM (32.60%) was observed in autumn, while the lowest (30.66%) was observed in winter. This analysis suggests that the model developed in this study is capable of simulating precipitation events and seasonal variations."

This study aims to predict user perceptions of the monetization of sports streaming services and their views on price appropriateness by employing the random forests algorithm, a machine learning technique. The findings reveal that in the model predicting user perceptions of monetization, a strengthened sports fan identity through paid sports streaming significantly contributes to a positive perception of monetization. Additionally, increased viewing time and high satisfaction with the paid streaming service after subscription are predictors of positive attitudes toward monetization. In the model predicting perceptions of price appropriateness, service satisfaction and content satisfaction were found to have significant predictive power.

"sEMG 신호를 이용한 Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost 기반 팔꿈치 각도 분류 성능 비교",2024,"['sEMG', 'Random Forest', 'SVM', 'XGBoost', 'Classification']",,"This study aimed to develop a machine learning model for classifying elbow angles using sEMG signals. Previous research in rehabilitation and robotic arm control has often combined sEMG and IMU sensors to measure muscle activity and precise angles. However, in rehabilitation, utilizing sEMG signals alone may be more practical than using multiple sensors. The use of sensors like IMUs increases equipment costs and complicates data pro- cessing, making interpretation more challenging. In contrast, sEMG signals reflect muscle activation and can predict angles simply and effectively, making them suitable for assessing elbow movements. This study classified elbow flex- ion and extension angles into 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90° using only sEMG sensors. sEMG data were collected from the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles and analyzed using Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost models to eval- uate angle classification performance. The experimental results showed high accuracy for all three models, with SVM and XGBoost demonstrating particularly superior performance. These findings suggest that sEMG signals alone can effectively predict elbow angles in applications such as rehabilitation and arm control, providing a valuable tool for assessing and aiding recovery of motor functions in rehabilitation therapy."

Due to smart contracts, security, transaction speed, transparency and reliability are guaranteed, and secure cryptocurrency transactions are possible in blockchain technology. However, there are fatal vulnerabilities in smart contracts, and technologies are being developed to suppress and supplement them. Among them, one of the important problems occurring in the Ethereum network, a vulnerability to gas limit, exists. A gas limit vulnerability is used as a fee required when a smart contract is executed in Ethereum, but it can manipulate this gas cost to induce contract suspension, interfere with optimization, and cause DoS attacks. This consumes only the victim's gas, causes network congestion, and damages. In this paper, we propose a technique to prevent gas limitation vulnerabilities by detecting transaction data occurring in the Ethereum network in real time. Through this technique, it is possible to minimize indiscriminate gas loss and prevent gas limitation vulnerabilities in advance by detecting abnormal transactions."
"Random Forest, XGBoost, LGBM 조합형 Stacking 모델을 이용한 풍력 발전량 예측 성능 평가",2024,,,"Wind power is highly variable due to the intermittent nature of wind. This can lead to power grid instability and decreased efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to improve wind power prediction performance to minimize the negative impact on the power system. Recently, wind power prediction using machine learning has gained popularity, and ensemble models in machine learning have shown high prediction accuracy. RF, GB, XGB and LGBM are decision tree-based ensemble models and have high predictive performance in wind power, but these models have problems from over-fitting and strong dependence on certain variables. However, the stacking model can improve prediction performance by combining individual models and compensate for the shortcomings of each model. In this study, The MAE of RF, XGB and LGBM is 310.42 kWh, 217.07 kWh and 265.20 kWh, respectively, while the stacking model based on RF, XGB and LGBM is 202.33 kWh. Stacking models can improve prediction performance. Finally, it is expected to contribute to electricity supply and demand planning."
A Study on Diabetes Management System Based on Logistic Regression and Random Forest,2024,"['Diabetes diagnosis', 'Logistic regression', 'Random forest']",,"In the quest for advancing diabetes diagnosis, this study introduces a novel two-step machine learning approach that synergizes the probabilistic predictions of Logistic Regression with the classification prowess of Random Forest. Diabetes, a pervasive chronic disease impacting millions globally, necessitates precise and early detection to mitigate long-term complications. Traditional diagnostic methods, while effective, often entail invasive testing and may not fully leverage the patterns hidden in patient data. Addressing this gap, our research harnesses the predictive capability of Logistic Regression to estimate the likelihood of diabetes presence, followed by employing Random Forest to classify individuals into diabetic, pre-diabetic or nondiabetic categories based on the computed probabilities. This methodology not only capitalizes on the strengths of both algorithms-Logistic Regression's proficiency in estimating nuanced probabilities and Random Forest's robustness in classification-but also introduces a refined mechanism to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Through the application of this model to a comprehensive diabetes dataset, we demonstrate a marked improvement in diagnostic precision, as evidenced by superior performance metrics when compared to other machine learning approaches. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating diverse machine learning models to improve clinical decision-making processes, offering a promising avenue for the early and accurate diagnosis of diabetes and potentially other complex diseases."
"Forest Vertical Structure Mapping from Bi-Seasonal Sentinel-2 Images and UAV-Derived DSM Using Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost",2024,"['Forest vertical structure', 'Bi-seasonal analysis', 'Support vector machine', 'Extreme gradient boost', 'Random forest']",,"Forest vertical structure is vital for comprehending ecosystems and biodiversity, in addition to fundamental forest information. Currently, the forest vertical structure is predominantly assessed via an in-situ method, which is not only difficult to apply to inaccessible locations or large areas but also costly and requires substantial human resources. Therefore, mapping systems based on remote sensing data have been actively explored. Recently, research on analyzing and classifying images using machine learning techniques has been actively conducted and applied to map the vertical structure of forests accurately. In this study, Sentinel-2 and digital surface model images were obtained on two different dates separated by approximately one month, and the spectral index and tree height maps were generated separately. Furthermore, according to the acquisition time, the input data were separated into cases 1 and 2, which were then combined to generate case 3. Using these data, forest vetical structure mapping models based on random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boost(XGBoost)were generated. Consequently, nine models were generated, with the XGBoost model in Case 3 performing the best, with an average precision of 0.99 and an F1 score of 0.91. We confirmed that generating a forest vertical structure mapping model utilizing bi-seasonal data and an appropriate model can result in an accuracy of 90% or higher."
Open‑circuit fault diagnosis of three‑phase PWM rectifier circuits based on transient characteristics and random forest classification,2024,"['Three-phase PWM rectifier', 'Transient characteristics', 'Random forest classification', 'IGBT open-circuit fault']",,"Fault diagnosis is becoming increasingly important in improving the reliability of power electronic devices. The research in this paper focuses on the issue of the faulty operation that can occur after partial IGBT open-circuit faults in three-phase PWM rectifier circuits. To promptly and effectively diagnose faults and to determine their locations, a fault diagnosis method based on transient characteristics and random forest classification is proposed. First, the characteristics of single and double IGBT open-circuit faults in three-phase PWM rectifier circuits are analyzed. It is discovered that these faults do not immediately manifest. Instead, they exhibit fault characteristics in the corresponding time sequence. Then the random forest classifier is trained using transient fault samples from the three-phase PWM rectifier circuit. Finally, generalized testing is performed on data that was not involved in the training process, with an accuracy rate of over 98%. The use of frequency distribution graphs for visual analysis of the diagnostic results solves the problem of diagnosing multiple IGBT open-circuit faults."
Imbalanced data fault diagnosis method for nuclear power plants based on convolutional variational autoencoding Wasserstein generative adversarial network and random forest,2024,"['Imbalanced data fault diagnosis', 'Nuclear power plants', 'Feature selection', 'Convolutional variational autoencoding', 'gradient-penalty Wasserstein generative', 'adversarial network', 'Random forest']",,"Data-driven fault diagnosis techniques are significant for the stable operation of nuclear power plants (NPPs).However, in practical applications, the fault diagnosis of NPPs usually faces imbalance data problems with small fault samples and much redundant data which results in low model training efficiency and poor generalization performance. Thus, this paper proposes a convolutional variational autoencoding gradient-penalty Wasserstein generative adversarial network with random forest (CVGR) to reduce the impact of imbalanced samples on fault diagnosis. Firstly, a feature selection method based on the random forest is used to identify the most relevant measurements and reduce the impact of redundant data on fault diagnosis. Then, variational autoencoding is introduced into gradient-penalty Wasserstein generative adversarial to effectively extract original sample features and generate high-quality samples with high rationality and diversity. In addition, the convolutional neural network is used to extract the features of mixed samples to realize intelligent fault diagnosis. Finally, several experiments based on the Fuqing Unit 2 full-scope simulator under different operating conditions are used to validate the performance of the CVGR in data enhancement and intelligent fault diagnosis. The results show that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the imbalance data problem, which gives insights into intelligent fault diagnosis of NPPs."
"A Novel Approach for Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Multi-mode Processes Based on PCA, Random Forest, and K-means Clustering",2024,"['Diagnosis', 'fault detection', 'multi-mode processes', 'random forest.']",,"The multi-mode nature of many processes poses a challenge to fault detection and diagnosis tasks, as their non-monotonous behavior renders the traditional monitoring approaches incapable of capturing such varying patterns. This study introduces the F-DINAMITE algorithm, a novel fault detection and diagnosis method incorporating principal component analysis, random forest, and k-means clustering, aiming to identify normal and faulty operational conditions while reducing false alarms and detection errors and providing fault diagnosis capabilities. The novel features of F-DINAMITE include the tailored selection of the number of clusters to minimize the false alarm rate and the automatic update of the fault database when new faults are identified. We validated the proposed method with a case study of a complex building HVAC system, where the algorithm analyzed faults in air dampers and cooling valve systems, testing its detection and diagnosis performance. Moreover, we assessed its false alarm rate while monitoring normal operation data. F-DINAMITE achieves a reduction in false alarm and misdetection rates, compared to those of conventional PCA, while successfully diagnosing faults. This methodology could significantly contribute to maintenance in complex processes by expediting fault detection and reducing associated costs. Nevertheless, future research must focus on conducting a more comprehensive assessment of F-DINAMITE’s performance with more real-life case studies or high amounts of synthetic data."
Ranking Acoustic Cues for English Focus Prosody  with Random Forests,2024,"['focus', 'post-focus', 'prosody', 'acoustic features', 'ranking', 'random forests', 'English']",,"This study measured prosodic parameters related to English focus prosody, and ranked the cues that play a significant role in featuring English focus prosody using a random forest model. To achieve this research objective, we directly compared two focus conditions: broad focus and discourse-new focus. The broad focus condition was isolated, while the discourse-new focus condition was induced using a Q&A format. The findings revealed that both focus and post-focus regions exhibited distinct prosodic cues. In the focus regions, the primary distinguishing factor between the two focus conditions was duration, followed by intensity, pitch range, maximum pitch, mean pitch, and so on. Conversely, in the post-focus regions, mean absolute slope emerged as the foremost determinant in distinguishing between the two focus conditions. The remaining parameters were subsequently ranked in the following order: intensity, mean pitch, maximum pitch, duration, pitch range, minimum pitch, and so forth. In essence, different sets of acoustic cues demonstrated varying levels of influence on the focus and post-focus regions, each characterized by unique acoustic parameters, which ultimately defined the distinctive prosodic features of each region."

However, there are many existing customer reviews. Some online shopping platforms address this issue by ranking customer reviews according to their usefulness.However, we propose an alternative method to rank customer reviews, given that this system is easily manipulable. This study aims to create a ranking model for reviews based on their usefulness by combining product and seller service aspects from customer reviews. This methodology consists of six primary steps: data collection and preprocessing, aspect extraction and sentiment analysis, followed by constructing a regression model using random forest regression, and the review ranking process. The results demonstrate that the ranking model with service considerations outperformed the model without service considerations. This demonstrates the model's superiority in the three tests, which include a comparison of the regression results, the aggregate helpfulness ratio, and the matching score."

This study aims to select the most suitable model to estimate tropical forest aboveground biomass in Vietnam, helping to manage and monitor changes in biomass at regional and local scales. The study identified the optimal model for estimating forest aboveground biomass and minimizing the number of input variables while achieving satisfactory model performance. A total of 59 input variables, including topography, texture features, and vegetation indices, from satellite data were used in four non-parametric algorithms and a conventional parametric model, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to predict biomass and evaluate changes aboveground biomass over 10 years in two tropical forests in Vietnam. The results indicated that all models had good estimation performance with R2 ranging from 0.615 to 0.754. For RF, MLR, and XGBoost, vegetation indices contributed the highest model weights, occupying 77.71% – 92.48%. For ANN and SVM, textural and topographic features were the majority of the model weights (73.74 – 96.36%). The RF model performed the best using 59 variables (R2 = 0.754, MAE = 78.5 Mg∙ha−1, and %RMSE = 13.57%) and ten variables (R2 = 0.745, MAE = 85.8 Mg∙ha−1, and %RMSE = 16.17%). The biomass map using the RF and ten variables achieved a good degree of fitting of 0.76, so it was suitable for managing and monitoring forest biomass in Vietnam. The results indicated a sharp decrease in the areas of dense and very dense forests from 2013 to 2021 and a gradual increase in 2023."
"Tree Species Assemblages, Stand Structure, and Regeneration in an Old-Growth Mixed Conifer Forest in Kawang, Western Bhutan",2024,"['natural stand reference', 'nature conservation', 'nurse log', 'phytosociology', 'primary forest']",,"Old-growth mixed-conifer forests in Bhutan are characterized by remarkable tree species compositional heterogeneity. However, our knowledge of tree species assemblages and their structural attributes in these forests has been limited. Therefore, forest classification has been reliant on a single dominant species. This study aimed to distinguish tree species assemblages in an old-growth mixed conifer forest in Western Bhutan and to describe their natural compositional and stand structural characteristics. Furthermore, the regeneration status of species was investigated and the quantity and quality of accumulated coarse woody debris were assessed. Ninety simple random sampling plots were surveyed in the study site between 3,000 and 3,600 meters above sea level. Tree, standing deadwood, regeneration, and coarse woody debris data were collected. Seven tree species assemblages were distinguished by Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Indicator Species Analysis, representing five previously undescribed tree species associations with unique set of consistent species. Principal Component Analysis revealed two transitional pathways of species dominance along an altitudinal gradient, highly determined by relative topographic position. The level of stand stratification varied within a very wide range, corresponding to physiognomic composition. Rotated-sigmoid and negative exponential diameter distributions were formed by overstorey species with modal, and understorey species with negative exponential distribution. Overstorey dominant species showed extreme nurse log dependence during regeneration, which supports the formation of their modal distribution by an early natural selection process. This allows the coexistence of overstorey and understorey dominant species, increasing the sensitivity of these primary ecosystems to forest management."

Gaertn) with Compatible Associated and Naturally Grown Tropical Timber Tree Species in a Field Experiment at Madhupur Sal Forest, Bangladesh",2024,"['associated species', 'mono plantation', 'mixed plantation', 'naturally grown species', 'Shorea robusta']",,"This study aimed to develop a mixed plantation strategy, with Sal (Shorea robusta) as the primary tree species, along with four associated and two naturally grown tree species. Using a randomized complete block design (RCBD), the field experiment involved a control group (mono plantation) and three mixed plantation groups, each replicated four times, totaling 80 replicates (40 in 2019 and 40 in 2020). Survival rate, height and collar diameter growth of seedlings were recorded in both mono and mixed plots in July 2021. Statistical analyses, including one-way ANOVA on means from three replicate plots (p＜0.05) and a Tukey HSD test, were conducted to assess differences between treatments. Significant differences in survival rates were found among mono plantations, with TMono04 showing the highest survival rate (88% to 91%). However, there were no significant differences in survival rates among seedlings in mixed plantations. Notably, survival rates were lower in mono plantations compared to mixed plantations. Mono plantations showed significant differences in height growth across both 2019 and 2020 plots, with TMono05 achieving the highest height growth (101.1 cm to 123.6 cm). Similarly, mixed plantations showed significant differences in height growth, with TMixed7 displaying the most substantial growth (116.4 cm to 138.2 cm). Overall, mixed plantations showed greater height growth compared to mono plantations. Significant variations in collar diameter growth were noted in both the 2019 and 2020 mono plantation plots, with TMono01 showing the highest growth (10.2 mm to 11.1 mm). Similarly, among mixed plantations, a significant difference in collar diameter growth was observed, with TMixed4 exhibiting the highest growth (10.4 mm to 13.1 mm). Overall, mixed plantations showed higher collar diameter growth compared to mono plantations. The findings suggest that planting Sal trees alongside compatible associated and naturally grown tree species in the Sal forests is preferable over establishing mono plantations."
GeoAI-Based Forest Fire Susceptibility Assessment with Integration of Forest and Soil Digital Map Data,2024,"['forest fire susceptibility assessment', 'forest map', 'soil map', 'machine learning', 'random forest']",,"This study assesses forest fire susceptibility in Gangwon-do, South Korea, which hosts the largest forested area in the nation and constitutes ~21% of the country’s forested land. With 81% of its terrain forested, Gangwon-do is particularly susceptible to wildfires, as evidenced by the fact that seven out of the ten most extensive wildfires in Korea have occurred in this region, with significant ecological and economic implications. Here, we analyze 480 historical wildfire occurrences in Gangwon-do between 2003 and 2019 using 17 predictor variables of wildfire occurrence. We utilized three machine learning algorithms―random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine―to construct wildfire susceptibility prediction models and identify the best-performing model for Gangwon-do. Forest and soil map data were integrated as important indicators of wildfire susceptibility and enhanced the precision of the three models in identifying areas at high risk of wildfires. Of the three models examined, the random forest model showed the best predictive performance, with an area-under-thecurve value of 0.936. The findings of this study, especially the maps generated by the models, are expected to offer important guidance to local governments in formulating effective management and conservation strategies. These strategies aim to ensure the sustainable preservation of forest resources and to enhance the well-being of communities situated in areas adjacent to forests. Furthermore, the outcomes of this study are anticipated to contribute to the safeguarding of forest resources and biodiversity and to the development of comprehensive plans for forest resource protection, biodiversity conservation, and environmental management."
Effects on Heart Rate Variability and EEG of Type of Participation in Health Tourism Programs Involving Stays in Hot Springs and Forests in Asan,2024,"['brain wave', 'forest healing', 'health tourism program', 'heart rate variability', 'hot spring']",,"Background and objective: Health tourism, which involves activities for health promotion and therapeutic travel, is gainingattention as a means of stress and fatigue relief. While therapeutic programs involving forests and hot springs have beenreported to have positive effects, there is a lack of research on the combined benefits of these environments, as well ascomparative studies of static and dynamic health tourism. Therefore, this study aimed to examine changes in stress levelsby analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) and electroencephalograms (EEG) taken from participants in different types ofhealth tourism programs involving stays in hot springs and forests.Methods: A total of 20 adults (9 males and 11 females) were randomly assigned to either the Relax Tour program (N=10)or the Activity Tour program (N=10). Both health tour programs, which included forest walking and aquatic exercise in hotsprings, were implemented. To ensure homogeneity between the groups, physical characteristics, EEG, and HRV wereassessed using independent samples t-tests. The effects of the health tourism participation type on EEG and HRV wereanalyzed using a two-way mixed-design ANOVA. When significant differences were found, post-hoc analyses wereconducted using the Bonferroni method.Results: An HRV analysis showed no significant differences between the groups; however, significant changes wereobserved based on the time points measured. An EEG analysis showed a significant increase in alpha waves in the ActivityTour group, while the Relax Tour group also showed a trend toward improvement in alpha waves.Conclusion: The increase in alpha and beta waves in the Activity Tour group after participation in the health tourismprograms involving hot springs and forest activities suggests that physical activity has a positive effect on the participants’relaxation and concentration. On the other hand, both groups showed a decrease in RMSSD and SDNN for HRV, whichseems to be related to the accumulated fatigue of the participants from the program activities. Therefore, in the future,when implementing health tourism programs based on hot springs and forests, it seems necessary to consider long-termeffects, and ways in which the design of such programs could be optimized to increase effectiveness."
The impact of ketamine on outcomes in critically ill patients: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials,2024,"['critical care', 'critical illness', 'intensive care unit', 'ketamine', 'pain management']",,"Background: This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of ketamine in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients.Methods: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library; the search was performed initially in January but was repeated in December of 2023. We focused on ICU patients of any age. We included studies that compared ketamine with other traditional agents used in the ICU. We synthesized evidence using RevMan v5.4 and presented the results as forest plots. We also used trial sequential analysis (TSA) software v. 0.9.5.10 Beta and presented results as TSA plots. For synthesizing results, we used a random-effects model and reported differences in outcomes of two groups in terms of mean difference (MD), standardized MD, and risk ratio with 95% confidence interval. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB tool for RCTs. Our outcomes were mortality, pain, opioid and midazolam requirements, delirium rates, and ICU length of stay.Results: Twelve RCTs involving 805 ICU patients (ketamine group, n=398; control group, n=407) were included in the meta-analysis. The ketamine group was not superior to the control group in terms of mortality (in five studies with 318 patients), pain (two studies with 129 patients), mean and cumulative opioid consumption (six studies with 494 patients), midazolam consumption (six studies with 304 patients), and ICU length of stay (three studies with 270 patients). However, the model favored the ketamine group over the control group in delirium rate (four studies with 358 patients). This result is significant in terms of conventional boundaries (alpha=5%) but is not robust in sequential analysis. The applicability of the findings is limited by the small number of patients pooled for each outcome.Conclusions: Our meta-analysis did not demonstrate differences between ketamine and control groups regarding any outcome except delirium rate, where the model favored the ketamine group over the control group. However, this result is not robust as sensitivity analysis and trial sequential analysis suggest that more RCTs should be conducted in the future."
Total Phenolic and Starch Content of Arrowroot Tuber in The Agroforestry System,2024,"['Intercropping', 'Falcataria moluccana', 'Maranta arundinacea', 'medicinal plant', 'functional food crops']",,"Indonesia’s tropical forest management faces several challenges owing to the growing demand for forest resources and increasing population. The forestry sector plays a significant role in supporting food security programs by harnessing the potential of forest resources.One solution to sustainable forest management and optimal forest land use is agroforestry techniques. Arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) is tolerant to heavy shade and is a promising functional food crop that can contribute to food security programs. Starch content in arrowroot tuber plays an important role in meeting nutritional requirements and overcoming several health problems. Arrowroot tubers also contain phenolic compounds, the largest group of compounds that act as natural antioxidants in plants. This study aimed to analyze the total phenolic and starch contents of arrowroot tubers cultivated in agroforestry systems.We used a Randomized Complete Block Design with a planting pattern as treatment for the species combinations of Falcataria moluccana þ arrowroot (FA), F. moluccana þ arrowroot þ Amomum cardamomum (FAC), and monoculture arrowroot (MA) with three blocks/replications.The arrowroot tubers were harvested from nine-month-old plants and composite samples representing each treatment were analyzed for total phenolic and starch contents. The total phenolic content in the arrowroot tubers was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Starch content was measured using the Modified Somogyi method, which involves preparing reagents, followed by hydrolysis and the reducing sugar determination methods.The results revealed that the planting pattern significantly affected starch content. The highest starch content was observed in the MA pattern of 23.99%, followed by the FAC and FA planting patterns of 22.75% and 18.44%, respectively. The planting pattern did not significantly affect phenolic content. The MA, FAC, and FA patterns yielded the highest to lowest phenolic contents of 218.02, 212.62, and 210.04 mg/g, respectively. Furthermore, the planting pattern significantly affected the total phenolic of tuber yield per plant, with the highest value of 214.48 mg yielded by MA pattern. Thus, agroforestry practices can maintain the phenolic and starch content of arrowroot tubers. The development of arrowroot in agroforestry system will be prospective not only for meeting food demand, but also for supporting forestry multi-business and social forestry programs to achieve sustainable forest management."
Estimating above-ground biomass of trees outside forests using multi-frequency SAR data in the semi-arid regional landscape of southern India,2024,['Above ground biomass · Random forest · Sentinel-1 · ALOS PALSAR · Synthetic aperture radar · Trees · Semi-arid'],,"Trees outside forests are vital for sustainable resource management and play a crucial role in the sequestration of carbon. This study attempted to estimate the above ground biomass (AGB) of trees outside forests utilizing the datasets of ALOS PALSAR-2 (L-band) and Sentinel-1 (C-band), with a focus on a semi-arid region in Sri Sathya Sai district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Here, we employed random forest (RF) algorithm integrating AGB observed over a large-scale ecological plot and remote sensing technology for generating 3 models (Model-1 (M1), Model-2 (M2), and Model-3 (M3)). Backscattering coefficients (VV and VH) and H-α dual pol decomposition parameter, anisotropy (A) from Sentinel-1 were applied for M1, and the backscattering coefficients (HV and HH) and the band ratio (HV/HH) from ALOS PALSAR-2 data were utilized in M2. M3 is the ensemble of parameters from both sensors. Validating the three models found that the R2 values fall between 0.44 and 0.64, the RMSE between 1.89 t/ha and 2.49 t/ha, and the MAE between 1.56 t/ha and 1.99 t/ha. The results of the study suggest that both Sentinel-1 and ALOS PALSAR-2 data can be employed for AGB estimation in semi-arid regions incorporating machine learning algorithms like RF. The results of the study are crucial for sustainable land management and reducing uncertainty using data from large-area ecological plot and multi-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR)."
연합 Isolation Forest,2024,"['Federated Learning', 'Isolation Forest', 'Non-IID Data', 'Outlier Detection']",,"Outlier detection is the task of detecting data that significantly deviates from normal patterns and is applied in a variety of application fields. However, most outlier detection techniques are designed to be applied to centralized data, making it difficult to properly respond to privacy protection or limitations in data collection and sharing. In this paper, we propose a method for learning Isolation Forest in a federated learning environment that shares a global machine learning model while maintaining independent storage of data among clients. In the proposed method, instead of learning complete isolation trees from each client, we construct Isolation Forest that can reflect various data distributions among clients by increasing the height of the tree by 1 in a randomly selected client and repeating this process until a limited tree height is reached. Experimental results in a federated learning environment in which normal data consists of data of multiple classes and clients include only some of the normal classes demonstrate that the Isolation Forest by the proposed method obtains high outlier detection performance in a federated learning environment of non-IID data."
Impact of environmental conditions on the early growth of the endangered Korean fir (Abies koreana E.H.Wilson): insights for conservation and restoration strategies,2024,"['South Korea', 'Subalpine Forests', 'Ecological Restoration', 'Biodiversity', 'Endangered Species']",,"Environmental factors are crucial elements that significantly influence the growth and development of plants. This study investigated the impact of environmental conditions (light, air temperature, air humidity, etc.) on the early growth of juvenile Korean fir (Abies koreana E.H.Wilson). Using random forest models and scatterplot matrix analyses, we examined the complex relationships between juvenile Korean fir early survival and various environmental factors. Specifically, a one-way ANOVA was conducted to assess the impact of light regulation in shading experiments on the growth of Korean fir seedlings. Additionally, a t-test was performed to compare the growth differences of Korean fir seedlings in two restoration sites with different canopy coverages. The results confirmed that light conditions significantly affect the growth of Korean fir seedlings, with better early growth observed in shaded conditions compared to full sunlight. Furthermore, field restoration site surveys indicated that the growth of height and root collar diameter of restored Korean fir seedlings was better in areas where the canopy coverage of the existing forest was between 60% and 75%. These findings suggest that the prerequisite for the restoration of the endangered Korean fir seedlings is the achievement of optimal light conditions during the early establishment phase."
Effects of stochastic intraspecific seed dispersal variation on dispersal distance predictions in a temperate forest in Japan,2024,['deterministic simulation Ogawa Forest Reserve seed dispersal stochasticity'],,"The incorporation of seed dispersal models into conservation practices plays a pivotal role in predictingfuture ecosystems. Seed dispersal significantly influences plant population dynamics; however, ourunderstanding of its implications at a landscape scale remains limited. We investigated how differentseed dispersal processes impact the distributions of individual species within a 20 km  20 km plotcentered around a temperate old-growth forest reserve in Japan. We hypothesized that random variationin seed dispersal (i.e., stochastic processes) and variation mediated by distance (i.e., deterministic pro cesses) would explain landscape-scale species distributions more effectively than deterministic seeddispersal processes alone. We evaluated 16 tree species with different seed dispersal modes by simu lating seed dispersal processes. Stochastic simulations predicted higher dispersal distances for the ma jority of species. The findings of this study suggest that stochastic simulations are a more reliable tool foridentifying dispersal restrictions in the context of climate change and biodiversity loss, highlighting thesignificance of using stochastic simulations for analyzing seed dispersal patterns in temperate forests,rather than more conventional deterministic methods."
Comparative efficacy of chemical peels and laser treatments in melasma: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,2024,"['chemical peels', 'laser treatments', 'melasma', 'meta-analysis', 'post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation', 'randomized controlled trials']",,"Melasma is a chronic pigmentation disorder that is difficult to treat due to its recurrent nature. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of chemical peels and laser treatments in reducing pigmentation and associated risks like post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). To compare chemical peels and laser treatments for melasma, focusing on their effectiveness in reducing pigmentation severity (Melasma Area and Severity Index) and assessing risks like PIH. We analyzed 15 randomized controlled trials comparing outcomes of chemical peels (e.g., glycolic acid, salicylic acid) and laser treatments (e.g., Q-switched Nd, fractional lasers). Outcomes included melasma severity reduction, PIH incidence, and patient satisfaction. Data were synthesized using standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and forest and funnel plots were used to evaluate efficacy and publication bias. Lasers showed higher efficacy in reducing melasma severity (SMD=0.82, 95% CI [0.60, 1.04], p<0.001) than chemical peels (SMD=0.65, 95% CI [0.45, 0.85], p=0.015). However, lasers had a higher risk of PIH, especially in darker skin types (Fitzpatrick IV–VI), while chemical peels were safer with fewer complications. Laser treatments effectively reduce melasma severity but increase PIH risk. Chemical peels, though slower, are safer for patients prone to adverse effects. Combination therapies and maintenance strategies may improve long-term outcomes in melasma"
Effect of simulated dust storm conditions on the physiological features of wild pistachio,2024,"['Dry sediment', 'chlorophyll', 'antioxidant enzymes', 'proline', 'carbohydrate']",,"Dust storms are a common natural phenomenon in the world, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world. This phenomenon, like other natural hazards, can have harmful effects on the plants. This study investigates the effects of dust under simulated conditions on the biochemical properties of wild pistachio (Pistacia atlantica). Two-year-old seedlings were provided by a state nursery. As a completely randomized design, seedlings were put in simulated dust chamber. The dust was applied at concentrations of 5000, 7000 and 9000 mg/m3 for 10 weeks with intervals of 12 days. At the same time, ten seedlings were selected as control seedlings. At the end of each dusting period, the leaves of the treated and control seedlings were collected from the middle part of the crowns and stored in the freezer for further analysis. The results showed a decrease in chlorophyll pigments and carotenoids with increasing dust concentration, while carbohydrates and catalase and peroxidase enzymes increased. No significant differences were observed in the proline content of the treated and control seedlings. This could be due to the short time of treatment as well as the intensity of the induced dust storm stress. In conclusion, the results can be considered as basic information on the variations of physiological characteristics of forest trees to natural dust storms and their adaptability to climatic changes."
Effect of arbuscular mycorrhizae on the growth of Cinchona officinalis L.

This study aimed to determine the effect of the commercial product Myco Grow® on the growth of C. officinalis in nursery. A randomized design was used with two treatments, one with Myco Grow® application (WM) and the other without incorporating this commercial product (NM). Each treatment had three replicates consisting of 30 plants each.Monthly evaluations were performed, during which the number of dead plants, plant height, and plant diameter were recorded. Additionally, at the end of the study, the anhydrous weight of leaves, stems, and roots; leaf area; mycorrhizal frequency; mycorrhizal colonization index; and the length of extra-radicular mycelia were determined. The WM treatment achieved 36.6% lower mortality, 38.01% greater height, and 48.52% greater diameter than the NM treatment.Additionally, inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) improved the anhydrous weights of the leaves, stems, roots, and leaf area by 84.31%, 84.28%, 70.85%, and 76.91%, respectively.Regarding the three fungal variables analyzed for the WM treatment; mycorrhizal frequency was 87%, AM application led to a mycorrhizal intensity of 7.7% and an extra-radicular mycelium length of 90.3 cm. This study confirmed that AM positively influences the growth of C. officinalis in the nursery and can be used to sustainably produce this species on a large scale."
"Effect of synthetic fertilization dose on the diameter increase, height and mortality of Cinchona officinalis L. (Rubiaceae)",2024,"['Fertilizer', 'percentage mortality', 'cinchona tree', 'forest nursery']",,"Cinchona officinalis, is a South American tree species, commonly used for medicine, and is currently threatened by agricultural expansion and cattle ranching. The objective was to determine the effect of chemical fertilization on the nursery growth to increase growth potential and survival of C. officinalis. A completely randomized design with six treatments and three replicates was used; 20 C. officinalis plants were used per replicate. Two months after transplanting the C. officinalis seedlings to the polyethylene bags, inorganic fertilizer (YaraMila® HYDRAN) was applied. Monthly evaluations were carried out and the number of dead plants, plant height, diameter and number of leaves were recorded. The highest mortality rate was recorded when fertilizer was applied (73%) while in the non-fertilized treatment mortality reached 36%. Regarding the increase in height, diameter and number of leaves in all cases, the best results were obtained in the fertilized treatments, exceeding by 85, 70 and 17% (respectively) those obtained in the treatment to which fertilization was not applied. This study shows the effects that the application of fertilizers to C. officinalis plants at the nursery level can have on growth and mortality variables, the results suggest the use of this product for a sustainable and large-scale production of this species taking into consideration the appropriate dosage."
"Composition and diversity of woody plant species in agro-ecosystems of Uluguru Mountains, Tanzania",2024,"['Crop fields', 'hedgerows', 'homegardens', 'richness', 'evenness', 'Eastern Arc mountains']",,"Woody plant species are important components of agro-ecosystems that determine their productivity and biodiversity conservation in tropical mountain landscapes. This study investigates woody plant species composition and diversity through simple random sampling of sixty (10 × 10 m) plots in crop fields, hedgerows, and homegardens at Uluguru Mountains, Morogoro, Tanzania. In total, 85 woody plant species, representing 82 genera and 40 families were recorded. The most species-rich families were Proteaceae (with 323 individuals), Lauraceae (205), and Meliaceae (185).

Hedgerows recorded the maximum richness, followed by homegardens and lastly crop fields. Present agro-ecosystems should be promoted to enhance the restoration and conservation of agro-biodiversity in mountain landscapes."
Material Selection for Restoration of Genetic Diversity of  Abies koreana on Mt. Jirisan in South Korea,2024,"['expected heterozygosity', 'genetic diversity', 'population genetics', 'sampling strategy', 'simple sequence repeat', 'sub-alpine coniferous']",,"A strategy is required for selecting appropriate materials for the restoration of Abies koreana on Mt. Jirisan, where the habitat of A. koreana is continuously shrinking. The current study aimed to analyze the genetic characteristics of A. koreana in three subpopulations (Banyabong, Byeoksoryeng, and Cheonwangbong) on Mt. Jirisan using 10 nuclear simple sequence repeat (nSSR) markers and calculate the sampling distance for each subpopulation for avoiding genetically similar samples. Based on the calculated sampling distance, we proposed the size of a sample containing more than 95% of the alleles at a frequency greater than 0.05. AMOVA showed that the difference in genetic variation across subpopulations of A. koreana on Mt.Jirisan was small, approximately 3% of the total. Spatial genetic structure analysis results suggested that it would be appropriate to collect samples of the Banyabong subpopulation at intervals of 10 m or more, when sampling A. koreana, whereas for the Byeoksoryeong and Cheonwangbong subpopulations, samples should be collected at intervals of 20 m or more.Results of random sampling of 5 to 30 individuals indicated that, by applying a 10 m distance within the Banyabong subpopulation, more than 95% of the total alleles with a frequency ≥ 0.05 were secured when more than 25 individuals were extracted. Therefore, as a restoration strategy for A. koreana on Mt. Jirisan, we proposed the collection of more than 25 samples, keeping 10 m distance within the Banyabong subpopulation, which has a relatively high genetic diversity."
Cross-Specific Amplification of SSR Markers in Dalbergia latifolia and Dalbergia sissoo - A Case for Hybrid Seed Production,2024,"['Dalbergia sissoo', 'Dalbergia latifolia', 'SSR markers', 'breeding behavior', 'hybrid seed production']",,"Dalbergia sissoo and Dalbergia latifolia are the two most important timber wood species that are indigenous to the Indo-Pak subcontinent producing very high-quality timber. Its wood is used to produce high-quality furniture. Due to overexploitation and dieback disease, their production is seriously hampered and threatens their genetic diversity. Several ecotypes are tolerant to dieback thus offering an opportunity to develop a superior hybrid for the establishment of plantations for hybrid seed production. Hybrid evaluation can only be done by using DNA markers such as SSR markers. Cross-specific amplification of SSR markers is a cost-effective way of producing DNA markers for species lacking genetic information. Here, we report for the first-time successful cross-amplification of SSR markers in Dalbergia latifolia and added new SSR markers in D. sissoo. Cross-species amplification resulted in 13 successful SSR markers in D. latifolia and an addition of 14 markers in D. sissoo of expected sizes. Six SSR markers were further selected randomly to validate the breeding behavior of both species. A diverse DNA profile of seed progenies matched to different pollen donors deviated from the same mother suggested cross-pollination is the most likely mechanism of seed production in D. sissoo and D. latifolia. However, the results must be validated by using a large sample size and through controlled pollinations. SSR markers thus developed will be useful in the conservation and development of superior hybrids for sustainable development and production of commercial populations in Dalbergia sissoo and D. latifolia."
Maturity Effects on the Nutritional Composition of Cleome gynandra L. (A Wild Vegetable),2024,"['nutritional composition', 'wild vegetables', 'Cleome gynandra', 'fertilizers']",,"Cleome gynandra L. is cultivated for its nutritional benefits. Nutritional composition of most vegetable plant increases with relative growth rate. Therefore, the contribution of organic (e.g. goat manure) and inorganic fertilizers (such as NPK) to optimum nutritional composition and productivity of Cleome gynandra is poorly understood. The nutritional benefit at different growth stages is required to optimize its utilization as a vegetable. Therefore, the relationship between relative growth rate and proximate analysis of C. gynandra was investigated. Three treatments (control, 100 kg N/ha and 8 t goat manure/ha) were arranged in a randomized complete block design in field and glasshouse trials. 100 kg N/ha of inorganic fertilizer influenced more proximate constituents such as vitamin C, protein and ash while 8 t of organic fertilizer increased the crude lipid and phytate contents. The field trial was more favourably compared to the glasshouse. The ash content ranged between 6.49-19.64%, fibre 9.62-26.13%, lipid 1.07-6.94%, vitamin C ranged between 68.33-279.7 mg/100 g, protein 36.55-53.82; phytate 0.74-2.91 mg/100 g; oxalate 1.33-2.63 mg/100 g. It further reveals the concentrations of protein, vitamin C, and fibre can be explored better in the 2nd, 6th and 8th weeks respectively. The overall analysis of the proximate parameters analysed on the field and in the glasshouse showed variations in the nutritional composition of Cleome gynandra."
Inclination of Residents’ Access to Flood Management Interventions and Forestry Land Use Approaches in Contiguous Floodplains of South-Western Nigeria,2024,"['tree planting', 'forest conservation', 'flooding', 'nature-based solutions', 'environmental interventions']",,"The recurrent flood occurrence in the contiguous floodplains of South-Western Nigeria despite provisions of mitigation measures by government is an intricate issue of concern to environmental managers. Therefore, this study assessed inclination of residents to flood management interventions and forestry land use approaches (FLUA) in contiguous floodplains of South-Western Nigeria. A qualitative data using primary data collection with structured questionnaire and scheduled interview was used. A multistage (4-staged) random sampling was used for sample size selection of 250 residents. Collected data were analysed using frequencies, percentages, mean scores, and tested with chi-square and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Most residents were inclined to access constructed canals by government (74.4%), dredging and channelisation of river (72.8%), and drainage system (35.6%) whereas utilisation of FLUA showed tree planting (mean=1.8) which ranked 1st as the most popular FLUA, followed by conservation of trees (mean=1.6) which ranked 2nd. From the chi-square test, there is significant relationship between residents’ level of use of FLUA and residents’ access to drainage system (χ2=33.22, p=1×10-4), dredging and channelization of river (χ2=106.09, p=1×10-4). Furthermore, the CCA showed significant association and positive correlation between access to dredging/channelization and tree conservation in upland area (β=0.898, p=0.00, R2=0.382), sustenance of natural environment (β=0.774, p=0.00, R2=0.399) and landscaping of the environment (β=0.810, p=0.00, R2=0.417). The low R2 values suggests that the independent variables in the regression model did not effectively explain the variation in the dependent variables. The importance from residents’ inclination to accessing flood management interventions revealed reduction in flooding despite abysmally low utilization of FLUA in the contiguous floodplains’ communities of South-Western Nigeria."
Evaluation of nutrient loading technique potential of domestic tree species to promote forestation,2024,"['Luxury consumption', 'Pinus thunbergii', 'Quercus acutissima', 'Reclaimed tideland', 'Zelkova serrata']",,"Reclaimed lands, including reclaimed tidelands, usually have poor soil conditions, such as low nutrient and organic matter contents and poor soil structures, which hamper adaptation and survival of newly transplanted tree seedlings. Nutrient loading technique is the concept of accumulating more nutrient in plant parts while maintaining biomass, which can increase growth and survival rates after transplanting in nutrient poor soils.However, possibility of nutrient loading on domestic tree species has not been evaluated in Korea. This study was conducted to test and select the optimum nutrient loading models for domestic tree species. Three nutrient loading models, including conventional (constant fertilizer dose), exponential (increasing fertilizer dose as exponential curve), and modified exponential (exponential increase but compensate initial fertilization), were tested for three tree species; Pinus thunbergii, Quercus acutissima, and Zelkova serrata. Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse from June to September in 2020, and selected amount of fertilizer was applied weekly.Three seedlings were collected randomly every 4 weeks in each tree species and nutrient loading model, and dry matter and nitrogen (N) concentration in each part, including root, stem, and leaf, were analyzed, and seeding height was measured. Seedling height was not different with nutrient loading models for all tree species.For P. thunbergii, dry matter and N content were the highest with the conventional and modified exponential models, and for Q. acutissima and Z. serrata, the modified exponential model was the best. The modified exponential model resulted in the highest nutrient loading efficiency due to the compensation of N supply at the beginning of growing stage and the higher N supply rates at the late growing stage compared to the conventional model. However, survival rate of seedlings for exponential model decreased after middle growing stage because of toxicity of excessive N fertilization due to rapid supply of N. Therefore, diverse rate of N fertilization needs to be tested to select the optimum nutrient loading models for each species. Furthermore, field study is needed to test if nutrient loaded seedings grow better than conventional seedlings at poor soil condition lands."

This study developed an automated scoring model for two descriptive items in first-year middle school mathematics using the Random Forest algorithm, evaluated its performance, and explored ways to enhance this performance. The accuracy of the final models for the two items was found to be between 0.95 to 1.00 and 0.73 to 0.89, respectively, which is relatively high compared to automated scoring models in other subjects. We discovered that the strategic selection of the number of evaluation categories, taking into account the amount of data, is crucial for the effective development and performance of automated scoring models. Additionally, text preprocessing by mathematics education experts proved effective in improving both the performance and interpretability of the automated scoring model. Selecting a vectorization method that matches the characteristics of the items and data was identified as one way to enhance model performance. Furthermore, we confirmed that oversampling is a useful method to supplement performance in situations where practical limitations hinder balanced data collection. To enhance educational utility, further research is needed on how to utilize feature importance derived from the Random Forest-based automated scoring model to generate useful information for teaching and learning, such as feedback. This study is significant as foundational research in the field of mathematics descriptive automatic scoring, and there is a need for various subsequent studies through close collaboration between AI experts and math education experts."

To achieve this, WVC occurrence data were collected nationwide, and spatial clustering analysis was conducted. Additionally, hotspot areas were identified, and the influence of various environmental factors on these hotspots was quantitatively analyzed using the Random Forest model. The analysis revealed that WVCs exhibited distinct changes in clustering patterns at approximately a 1 km distance. Among the key environmental factors influencing the hotspots, speed limits were identified as the most significant factor, followed by the number of lanes, mean elevation, population, and core area. By systematically analyzing the spatial distribution and influencing factors of wildlife-vehicle collisions, this study provides scientific evidence for mitigating WVCs. The findings are expected to be practically utilized in establishing tailored mitigation strategies for specific road sections, selecting locations for ecological corridors, managing road speed limits, and formulating effective wildlife protection policies."

Thus, a latent profile analysis was conducted to classify various latent types of emotional well-being and explore the variables that predict the risk group for emotional well-being using a random forest. Data from 6,212 second-year high school students who responded to the 7th year survey of the KELS 2013 were analyzed, and 170 predictors related to students, families, and schools were included in the model. Through the analysis, the latent profiles of high school students’ emotional well-being were classified into four distinct groups: High Emotional Well-being, Upper-Middle Emotional Well-being, Lower-Middle Emotional Well-being, and Low Emotional Well-being. The results indicate that factors such as self-concept, relationships with parents and peers, career maturity, academic or examination stress, and sense of community were significantly influential in categorizing students into the Low Emotional Well-being group, compared to the first three groups.Educational Impact and Implications : To improve the emotional well-being of high school students, social dimensions, such as relationships with parents or peers, sense of community, individual student self-concept, career path, and academic-related variables, should be considered. The results of this study can be used to develop educational programs based on the level of students’ emotional well-being and to establish related educational policies."

연합 학습 환경에서의 랜덤 포레스트 알고리즘 최적화 전략 연구,2024,"['연합 학습', '랜덤 포레스트', '분산 환경', 'Federated Learning', 'Random Forest', 'Distributed Environment']",,"Federated learning has garnered attention as an efficient method for training machine learning models in a distributed environment while maintaining data privacy and security. This study proposes a novel FedRFBagging algorithm to optimize the performance of random forest models in such federated learning environments. By dynamically adjusting the trees of local random forest models based on client-specific data characteristics, the proposed approach reduces communication costs and achieves high prediction accuracy even in environments with numerous clients. This method adapts to various data conditions, significantly enhancing model stability and training speed. While random forest models consist of multiple decision trees, transmitting all trees to the server in a federated learning environment results in exponentially increasing communication overhead, making their use impractical. Additionally, differences in data distribution among clients can lead to quality imbalances in the trees. To address this, the FedRFBagging algorithm selects only the highest-performing trees from each client for transmission to the server, which then reselects trees based on impurity values to construct the optimal global model. This reduces communication overhead and maintains high prediction performance across diverse data distributions. Although the global model reflects data from various clients, the data characteristics of each client may differ. To compensate for this, clients further train additional trees on the global model to perform local optimizations tailored to their data. This improves the overall model’s prediction accuracy and adapts to changing data distributions. Our study demonstrates that the FedRFBagging algorithm effectively addresses the communication cost and performance issues associated with random forest models in federated learning environments, suggesting its applicability in such settings."

However, their centralized nature often poses challenges when dealing with distributed, decentralized, and private data sources. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a paradigm allowing distributed learning without compromising privacy. Nevertheless, porting ensemble methods like random forests into the federated environment introduces unique challenges, especially in handling non-IID data distributions. This study presents a federated random forest approach that employs a novel ensemble construction method. Rather than growing trees independently in each client, our approach ensures each decision tree in the ensemble is iteratively and collectively constructed across clients. After this, the clients adjust the leaf nodes of each tree, and a global server aggregates these updates across clients. This strategy allows the ensemble to better reflect the data's heterogeneity across different clients, enhancing its performance on non-IID data. Furthermore, we show that the proposed federated random forest method inherently facilitates incremental learning, effectively addressing the dynamic expansion of the federation, which allows the update of the existing ensemble model by seamlessly integrating data from newly participating clients without full retraining. This method maintained high performance with reduced complexity, as our experimental results confirmed."

RF and BRF models were made up using the well-known KDDTrain+ data and evaluated with KDDTest+ data. The difference in the performance of RF and BRF was the tendency for BRF to have higher recall and lower accuracy compared to RF in intrusion types included in minority classes. Despite the decrease in accuracy, this effect of BRF can be expected to reduce serious damage by detecting intrusion types with high probabilities."

The results show that foreign factors such as exchange rates and external interest rate differentials contribute more to the determination of domestic long-term interest rates than domestic factors such as output and inflation. This suggests that the contribution of foreign factors to changes in domestic long-term interest rates has increased as international interest rates have become more synchronized due to the Fed's quantitative easing policy and global capital mobility. We also analyzed the partial effects of individual variables on long-term interest rates and found that the U.S. long-term interest rate has the highest explanatory power. Random forest models have the advantage of capturing non-linear relationships between variables while further improving model accuracy. It is expected that various algorithms in the field of machine learning, such as the random forest algorithm used in this article, can help solve various economic and financial problems if they are utilized appropriately."

In this study, we sought to assess the optimal levels of nitrogen fertilization for the cultivation of rice based on based on measurements of leaf spectral reflectance and the use of a random forest classification model.On the basis of the standard fertilization rate, we applied four levels of nitrogen fertilization (0%, 50%, 100%, and 200%) and measured plant height, tiller number, SPAD values, chlorophyll concentrations, and spectral reflectance of rice leaves at different stages of growth. With an increase in rate of nitrogen fertilization, we recorded increases in plant height, the number of tillers, SPAD values, and leaf chlorophyll concentrations. In contrast, we recorded reductions in the spectral reflectance of leaves in the 550 and 710 nm wavelength regions in response to an increase nitrogen fertilization. On the basis of these findings, wavelengths highly correlated with nitrogen fertilization levels were extracted using a PSL model and used as input variables for constructing a random forest classification model. The performance of the model was found to vary throughout the growth period, with a classification accuracy ranging from 76.2% to 91.2%. We speculate that this variability in classification accuracy can be attributed to the timing of nitrogen fertilization, which determines nitrogen availability, and contributes to changes in chlorophyll levels during the heading and mature stages of growth. Thus, nitrogen fertilization levels can effectively be assessed using spectral reflectance in the late growth stages, during which the changes in chlorophyll concentrations are more pronounced. In the future, we will investigate whether obtaining sufficient spectral reflectance data for different treatment at specific growth stages of growth can contribute to enhancing the accuracy of the model developed herein, thereby enabling a more precise classification of nitrogen fertilization levels at the different stages of rice growth."

랜덤포레스트를 이용한 기상 환경에 따른 이상기온 분류,2024,"['Random forest', 'Imbalance data', 'Over-sampling', 'Climate crisis', 'Abnormal temperature']",,"Many abnormal climate events are occurring around the world. The cause of abnormal climate is related to temperature. Factors that affect temperature include excessive emissions of carbon and greenhouse gases from a global perspective, and air circulation from a local perspective. Due to the air circulation, many abnormal climate phenomena such as abnormally high temperature and abnormally low temperature are occurring in certain areas, which can cause very serious human damage. Therefore, the problem of abnormal temperature should not be approached only as a case of climate change, but should be studied as a new category of climate crisis. In this study, we proposed a model for the classification of abnormal temperature using random forests based on various meteorological data such as longitudinal observations, yellow dust, ultraviolet radiation from 2018 to 2022 for each region in Korea. Here, the meteorological data had an imbalance problem, so the imbalance problem was solved by oversampling. As a result, we found that the variables affecting abnormal temperature are different in different regions. In particular, the central and southern regions are influenced by high pressure (Mainland China, Siberian high pressure, and North Pacific high pressure) due to their regional characteristics, so pressure-related variables had a significant impact on the classification of abnormal temperature. This suggests that a regional approach can be taken to predict abnormal temperatures from the surrounding meteorological environment. In addition, in the event of an abnormal temperature, it seems that it is possible to take preventive measures in advance according to regional characteristics."

In order to achieve this goal, the turnover intention of the youth panel data from 2010 to 2021 was determined as a predictor. In addition, a total of 24 variables belonging to personal characteristics, job-related factors, and organizational structure factors referenced in previous studies were used as explanatory variables. The analysis was conducted using the random forest technique. Looking at the importance index of variables over time, it was found that variables such as ‘job location’, ‘company size’, ‘job satisfaction’, ‘major agreement’, and ‘payment satisfaction’ were prominent among the top variables of importance. In addition, variables such as ‘performance evaluation satisfaction’, ‘job satisfaction’, ‘job satisfaction’, ‘self-satisfaction’, and ‘job satisfaction’ showed the highest importance from 2016 to 2021. Considering the frequency of major predictors over time, variables such as ‘job satisfaction’, ‘job location’, and ‘child status’ could be identified. Finally, it was found that the ‘employment type’ variable had less consideration for turnover than in the past. Through these results, to solve the problem of youth turnover, it is necessary to change the working environment suitable for the current youth generation. For example, companies should implement flexible working hours, flexible working hours, and vitalization of workplace childcare facilities, and consider the loss of awareness of lifelong workplace."

It aims to categorize swing voters and consistent loyal voters while exploring the factors that impact changes in party support among voters. We used a machine learning-based random forest prediction model, which has gained popularity in the social science realm, to analyze shifts and continuity in the party support patterns observed in the voting behavior of Korean voters at the group level. Taking a different approach to previous research, this study examines the voting decisions using all accessible survey data and questions, without making any theoretical or deductive assumptions regarding electoral behavior. We analyze how Korean voters’ party loyalty responded to various signs of major changes in the voter political landscape, such as the impeachment of the incumbent president, two regime changes, and deepening political polarization, focusing on whether voters swing. According to the research results, the partisan voting behavior of Korean voters was found to be quite consistent and sustainable even amid changes in the dynamic political environment over the past 10 years. The machine learning model, developed using data from the voter awareness survey conducted during the 19th Presidential Election, demonstrated accuracy that extended beyond that specific year. Furthermore, it showed a relatively high level of accuracy in predicting voting patterns in the 2017 and 2012 presidential elections. The findings imply that swing voters continue to exist in Korean politics even amid the deepening partisan polarization, and that they could play a major role in shaping election results."

To determine if a model performing well on balanced data also performs well on imbalanced data, the three models’ performances are measured under two conditions: when the training dataset is balanced and when it is imbalanced. The performances of the trained models on the first test dataset are evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, normalized confusion matrix, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The performances on the second test dataset are assessed in terms of accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, and recall. The results demonstrate that the Random Forest Classifier has the best performance among the three models regardless of the balance of training data."

Unsupervised machine learning techniques can be a new approach to deriving important crash risk indicators. This paper applies a multi-stage methodology using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques systematically to evaluate crash risks. The proposed multi-stage methodology is composed of three stages. In the first stage, select variables that can classify risky and general traffic flow well using K-means clustering and Random forest. The second stage is the combination of variables that were derived in the first stage to construct important variable sets for detecting crash precursors. Lastly, third stage, crash prediction models with variable sets, which are selected from the second step, were developed using the support vector machine method. For the real-time crash prediction model, individual vehicle trajectory data were collected from commercial vehicles and used. As a result of this study, the multi-stage models that include variable selection through a combination of K-means clustering and Random Forest methods improved the predictive performance.

Additionally, to address the fragmentation issue where some grids are classified with different climate characteristics despite being in regions with homogeneous climate traits, a filtering technique was applied, and the LCZ classification characteristics were compared according to the filtering radius. Using satellite images, ground reference data, and the supervised classification machine learning technique Random Forest, classification maps without filtering and with filtering radii of 1, 2, and 3 were produced, and their accuracies were compared. Furthermore, to compare the LCZ classification characteristics according to building types in urban areas, an urban form index used in GIS-based classification methodology was created and compared with the ranges suggested in previous studies. As a result, the overall accuracy was highest when the filtering radius was 1. When comparing the urban form index, the differences between LCZ types were minimal, and most satisfied the ranges of previous studies. However, the study identified a limitation in reflecting the height information of buildings, and it is believed that adding data to complement this would yield results with higher accuracy.

BAGAN-GP uses an autoencoder in the early stage of learning to infer the distribution of the major class and minor class and initialize the weights of the GAN. To resolve the weight clipping problem where the weights are concentrated on the boundary, the gradient penalty method is applied to appropriately distribute the weights within the range. Data augmentation techniques such as SMOTE, ADASYN, and Borderline-SMOTE are linearity-based techniques that connect observations with a line segment and generate data by selecting a random point on the line segment. On the other hand, BAGAN-GP does not exhibit linearity because it generates data based on the distribution of classes. Considering the generation of data with various characteristics and rare defective data, MO1 and MO2 techniques are proposed. The data is augmented with the proposed augmentation techniques, and the performance is compared with the cases augmented with existing techniques by classifying them with MLP, SVM, and random forest. The results of MO1 is good in most cases, which is believed to be because the data was augmented more diversely by using the existing oversampling technique based on linearity and the BAGAN-GP technique based on the distribution of class data, respectively."

Therefore, finding an intelligentdiagnosis method to detect the clogging status is of great importance. In this study, a deep residual network-basedmethod for diagnosing cutterhead clogging on shield tunneling machines is proposed. First, working state data ofthe shield tunneling machine is screened out, and parameters reflecting the clogging state are selected for furtheranalysis. After eliminating extreme outliers, an empirical formula is proposed to label the data. At the same time,several time-domain features of the selected excavation parameters within every five minutes are extracted. Thesefeatures are then fed into the proposed model as the input data to realize clogging detection. Because the originaldataset is imbalanced, the combination of f1-score and accuracy is used to evaluate the performance of the proposedmodel. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm reaches 95.71%, which is 1.21%, 2.84%,9.84%, 6.04%, and 0.86% higher than the support vector machine-based, random forest-based, AdaBoost-based,extreme gradient boosting-based and deep neural network-based methods. The f1 score of the proposed modelis 0.923, which is also 0.038, 0.042, 0.269, 0.169 and 0.02 higher than those compared methods. Therefore, theproposed deep residual network-based method can accurately detect cutterhead clogging conditions."

Traditionally, sparse vectors using TF-IDF have been commonly applied in conventional machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest. However, with the recent advancements in embedding models, the level of semantic understanding of sentences has significantly improved, and these models have been increasingly employed for solving domain-specific problems. In this study, we calculate dense vector representations using embedding models and apply them as feature values to traditional machine learning algorithms. The experiment was conducted using a spam/non-spam email dataset, and we validated the models through 10-fold cross-validation, utilizing five embedding models and four classification algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate a 2.6% improvement in the F-score when applying dense vectors with SVM, compared to using sparse vectors.

However, criticism has surfaced, contending that studies exclusively focused on teachers' viewpoints inadequately capture principal leadership in an objective manner. Consequently, there is a growing call for a thorough evaluation of leadership that encompasses the perceptions of both school administrators and teachers.To address this issue, this study employed the random forest technique on the 1st year data from the Korean Education and Employment Panel II. The objective was to discern factors predicting variations in the perception of principal leadership between school administrators and teachers. Subsequent to this, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), school fixed effect model, and school random effect model analyses were conducted employing variables identified for their substantial predictive power through the random forest analysis. This approach facilitated an investigation into principal leadership factors influencing differences in self-evaluation.The findings indicated that positive perceptions among teachers regarding the relationship between the principal and teachers, the conduct of school affairs meetings, teachers' competency, and the efficacy of the school management committee were associated with a reduction in the divergence in the perception of principal leadership between school administrators and teachers. Conversely, a more favorable perception among school administrators concerning the relationship between the principal and teachers, the operation of the curriculum council and student council, and the competencies of teachers in the school resulted in an augmented difference in perception of principal leadership between school administrators and teachers.Based on above results, this study aims to diminish the perceptual gap in principal leadership between school administrators and teachers. Recommendations encompass encouraging teachers to perceive themselves as active members and leaders within the school organization, cultivating an awareness of their roles and responsibilities, and actively participating in problems-solving processes. Furthermore, it is proposed that school administrators should objectively acknowledge their school's functioning and relationships with its members, making concerted efforts to enhance communication within the school community."

Water quality, river environment, and meteorological data were collected and analyzed at six locations along the Nakdong River in Gyeongsangbuk-do and Daegu City. The primary objective was to establish correlations between various environmental factors and validate the utility of predicting algae(cyanobacteria) occurrences.Methods:Cyanobacteria was designated as the dependent variable for correlation analysis. Water quality parameters associated with algal growth, including chlorophyll-a, water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen(DO), total nitrogen(TN), and total phosphorus(TP), were utilized as key indicators. Additionally, meteorological data such as air temperature, humidity, cloud cover, precipitation, and solar radiation, as well as flow rate and flow quantity, which are indicators of water body stability, were utilized. The collected data were verified and corrected for accuracy before analyzing correlations between cyanobacteria occurrence and the independent variables. Furthermore, cyanobacteria occurrence was predicted using a random forest algorithm, with a linear regression model serving as a baseline for comparison.Results and Discussion:The data presented a normal distribution. Correlation analysis indicated that previous cyanobacteria occurrences had a significant influence on current occurrences. Water temperature showed a positive correlation with cyanobacteria, while DO exhibited a negative correlation. Flow quantity and flow rate were inversely correlated with cyanobacteria cell density. In terms of meteorological data, air pressure negatively correlated with cyanobacteria occurrence, while air temperature showed a positive relationship. Substantial precipitation significantly reduced cyanobacteria concentrations; however, this effect was less pronounced during periods of low rainfall. The linear regression model, with an R2 value of 0.734, demonstrated considerable explanatory power, indicating its effectiveness in accounting for the variability of the dependent variable.Conclusion:The random forest, built on the linear regression model, successfully captured the overall trend of cyanobacteria occurrence when compared with field measurements. The model consistently maintained predictive performance by effectively recognizing complex data patterns, suggesting its potential for reliable prediction of cyanobacteria occurrence trends in aquatic ecosystems."

This study examines the meteorological drivers behind this trend using long-term observations and a Random Forest model. We analyzed annual trends of meteorological factors at three Automated Synoptic Observing Systems (ASOS) stations (Seoul, Suwon, Incheon) and observed a steady increase in insolation by 0.8% per year, with less significant changes in temperature and relative humidity. Analysis of the ozone data reveals that observed increasing trends remained generally similar among stations, implying shared major drivers influencing these trends. Correlation analyses between meteorological factors and maximum daily 8-hour average (MDA8) ozone anomalies indicated that insolation, sun duration, and temperature had positive associations, whereas relative humidity and cloud fraction showed negative correlations. Insolation emerged as the most influential factor, followed by temperature and relative humidity. We used the Random Forest model to calculate the contributions of meteorological variables to ozone changes. The model explained 69% of the observed variance in surface ozone, with predictions closely tracking observed median values. Meteorological factors, particularly increasing insolation, were significant drivers of the ozone increase in the SMA. Further investigations into the rising trend of insolation and the natural and anthropogenic factors contributing to this increase are necessary for understanding various aspects of photochemical air pollution and developing practical policies for air quality management."

However, after applying imbalance handling techniques such as SMOTE, the predictive performance for the minority class improved significantly. In particular, the Random Forest model, when combined with the SMOTE-Tomek Links technique, showed the highest predictive performance, making it the most suitable model for default prediction. These results suggest that effectively addressing data imbalance is crucial in developing accurate default prediction models, and the appropriate use of sampling techniques can greatly enhance predictive performance."

Additionally, a polynomial regression model was partially introduced to improve the accuracy of victim estimation in cases where the random forest model had not sufficiently learned from the data. The model was applied to Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea, as a case study area, and it predicted a high number of disaster victims in major flood-affected areas. The results confirmed that factors such as population, terrain, and building types—beyond just the flood area—contributed to these predictions.With the incorporation of additional data for model training and factors such as the distance to evacuation facilities in the future, this model is expected to become a crucial tool for urban planning and disaster management strategy development."

Unlike traditional store customers, online shoppers gather information through various media and make purchase decisions based on product reviews and purchase patterns. This study excludes personal basic characteristics such as gender, age, and occupation and instead collects and utilizes customer behavior data such as searches, cart additions, and page views to predict purchase likelihood. Given the difficulties in collecting basic characteristic data due to privacy concerns, the analysis method using only behavior data becomes even more important. This study used machine learning models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression to predict purchasing customers from behavior data. The performance of each model was evaluated to identify the most effective one, providing a reference for companies in selecting purchase prediction models. Additionally, we compared the purchase amounts between focusing marketing resources on identified potential buyers and distributing marketing resources equally to all customers to analyze the cost efficiency of targeted marketing. This study presents ways for online agricultural and fisheries retailers to better understand customer purchase behavior and efficiently allocate marketing resources to maximize sales. By providing a research framework and proposing prediction models, this study aims to offer methodologies for effective management strategies based on predictions from customer behavior data. Through analyzing customer behavior data, companies can develop more sophisticated targeted marketing strategies, ultimately leading to increased sales and cost savings."

클라우드 환경에서 메트릭 로그와 머신러닝을 이용한 지능형 장애 탐지 모델 고찰,2024,"['Failure Detection', 'Server Logs', 'Machine Learning', 'Decision Tree Algorithm', 'Random Forest']",,"This paper describes the process of building and optimizing a machine learning model using server metric logs to predict game service failures. Of 334 servers in operation for the game service, 29 logs were utilized, and the simultaneous connection drop was utilized. We loaded the first years metric log, which had one billion records, to the cloud. Due to the low frequency of failures, we extracted data from one to three hours before, and from one to three days before, the failure time to generate the dataset. The proposed model uses classification algorithms for machine learning, and performs the best on date-based datasets. The decision tree algorithm and random forest showed predictive performances of more 0.98. When applying machine learning with four metrics and two servers selected, both the decision tree algorithm and random forest performed at 1.0 with zero undetected errors. Unlike past studies, after selecting 126 metrics programmatically, we found higher performance from unexpected metrics. By leveraging these metrics, we could achieve high predictive performance regardless of the number of servers. Findings show that data extraction at a certain point in time is useful for failure prediction, and identifying the importance of metrics through a programmatic approach after machine learning is effective for building predictive models."

The training dataset consisted of concrete mixture sample data at this curing age, along with samples subjected to a total load not exceeding 2,350 kg. The objective was to train a machine learning model to create a more practical predictive model suitable for real-world applications.METHODS : Three machine learning models—random forest, gradient boosting, and AdaBoost—were selected. Subsequently, the prepared dataset was used to train the selected models. Model 1 was trained using concrete sample data from the 28th curing day, followed by a comprehensive analysis of the results. For Model 2, training was conducted using data from the 28th day of curing, focusing specifically on instances where the total load was 2,350 kg or less. The results were systematically analyzed to determine the most suitable machine learning model for predicting the compressive strength of concrete.RESULTS : The machine learning model trained on concrete sample data from the 28th day of curing with a total weight of 2,350 kg or less exhibited higher accuracy than the model trained on weight-unrestricted data from the 28th day of curing. The models were evaluated in terms of accuracy, with the gradient boosting, AdaBoost, and random forest models demonstrating high accuracy, in that order.CONCLUSIONS : Machine learning models trained using concrete mix data based on practical and real-world scenarios demonstrated a higher accuracy than models trained on impractical concrete mix data. This case illustrates the significance of not only the quantity but also the quality of the data during the machine learning training process. Excluding outliers from the data appears to result in better accuracy for machine learning models. This underscores the importance of using high-quality and practical mixed concrete data for reliable and accurate model training."
Sensitivity of Translation Universals to Genre/Register Variations: Focused on Corporate Reporting,2024,"['Translation universal', 'genre variation', 'corpus linguistics', 'corporate reporting', 'conditional inference tree', 'random forest']",,"This article aims to determine which specific linguistic feature more effectively distinguishes translated texts (TTs) from non-translated texts (NTTs) in the corporate reporting genre by adopting representative and comparable corpora with the help of conditional inference trees (CIT) and random forests (RF). Based on the widely explored translation theory of translation universals (TUs) and ample empirical evidence in this area, we selected linguistic features that were proven effective in showing the differences between TTs and NTTs. Among the numerous features known to represent the four categories of TUs— simplification, explicitation, normalization, and leveling out—we selected ten factors to find out how effective they are in distinguishing TTs from NTTs. After encoding ten factors in two monolingual, specialized corpora that consist of a total of 58 English management forewords of sustainability reports including TTs and NTTs, we analyzed the encoded data with conditional inference trees (CIT) and random forests (RF). The results show that, unlike our expectations, only simplification plays a significant role in identifying TTs from NTTs. This contrasts sharply with previous studies on the Korean-English language pair. The results not only confirm the considerable impact of genre variations on TU behaviors but also present the effectiveness of CIT and RF in corpus-based translation studies."

TPOT, which utilizes genetic algorithms to automate the generation of optimal machine learning pipelines, was used to build models. Additionally, Random Forest (RF) was implemented as a benchmark to evaluate TPOT’s applicability. Predictions were generated with lead times of 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours, and model accuracy was evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and root-mean-square error (RMSE).Results and Discussion:The predictions from both TPOT and RF showed high accuracy for shorter lead times, with NSE values exceeding 0.99 for the 1-hour predictions. However, predictive accuracy decreased as lead time increased, likely due to greater uncertainty in rainfall forecast data, particularly for the 12-hour predictions. Despite this trend, TPOT-derived models maintained more stable and accurate performance compared to RF models across all lead times.Conclusion:This study demonstrates the applicability of TPOT-based AutoML techniques in predicting hourly water levels in agricultural reservoirs. Future work should explore strategies to mitigate the decline in accuracy for longer lead times."

Compared with the verification dataset, the overall performance of the models indicated that the Random Forest(RF) showed the highest accuracy. The highest performance of the Random Forest(RF) model can be explained by its ability to combine multiple decision trees for a final prediction. Furthermore, the performance based on wildfire severity showed that all machine learning algorithm models had lower detection performance in heat damage areas compared with crown and surface fire areas. Crown and heat damage areas have similar spectral reflectance patterns, and heat damage and surface fire areas are considered to have shown lower performance due to the complex canopy structure.

The ultimate goal of this article is to provide a big data analysis of 330 reviews of the movie Noryang and to evaluate the Naive Bayes model, the Random Forests model, the DNN model, and the LSTM model in machine learning and deep learning. A point to note is that the name Yi, Sun-shin was the most widely used by viewers, followed by the word movie, and the word general, in that order. A major point of this article is that the name Yi, Sun-shin and the word movie showed up twice as the first keyword. This in turn implies that these keywords are the most noteworthy ones. The sentiment analysis argues that about 75% of viewers think of the film as well-made and that they were highly satisfied with it. In this paper, we used the Naive Bayes model, the Random Forests model, the DNN model, and the LSTM model and made them predict whether each review is positive or negative. The Random Forests model works well for our data, whereas the Naive Bayes model does not. When learning took place 25 times, the DNN model worked well for our data (its accuracy rate is 82.76%). When it comes to the LSTM model, its accuracy did not improve even though learning took place 9 times. Yet, the LSTM model is slightly better than the DNN model with respect to the accuracy rate of test data."

Especially, life satisfaction–overall was a top-5 determinant in the graph random forest, which considers life satisfaction as an emotional connection and a group interaction.Conclusion Improving an individual’s life satisfaction as a personal condition is expected to strengthen the individual’s emotional connection as a group interaction, which would reduce the risk of the individual’s mental disease in the end. This would bring an important clinical implication for highlighting the importance of a patient’s life satisfaction and emotional connection regarding the diagnosis and management of the patient’s mental disease."
기후변화 시나리오의 기온상승에 따른 낙동강 남세균 발생 예측을 위한 데이터 기반 모델 시뮬레이션,2024,"['Climate change scenarios', 'Cyanobacteria', 'Harmful algal bloom (HAB)', 'Machine learning', 'Nakdong river']",,"Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) are caused by the rapid proliferation of cyanobacteria and are believed to be exacerbated by climate change. However, the extent to which HCBs will be stimulated in the future due to increased temperature remains uncertain. This study aims to predict the future occurrence of cyanobacteria in the Nakdong River, which has the highest incidence of HCBs in South Korea, based on temperature rise scenarios. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were used as the basis for these scenarios. Data-driven model simulations were conducted, and out of the four machine learning techniques tested (multiple linear regression, support vector regressor, decision tree, and random forest), the random forest model was selected for its relatively high prediction accuracy. The random forest model was used to predict the occurrence of cyanobacteria. The results of boxplot and time-series analyses showed that under the worst-case scenario (RCP8.5 (2100)), where temperature increases significantly, cyanobacterial abundance across all study areas was greatly stimulated. The study also found that the frequencies of HCB occurrences exceeding certain thresholds (100,000 and 1,000,000 cells/mL) increased under both the best-case scenario (RCP2.6 (2050)) and worst-case scenario (RCP8.5 (2100)). These findings suggest that the frequency of HCB occurrences surpassing a certain threshold level can serve as a useful diagnostic indicator of vulnerability to temperature increases caused by climate change. Additionally, this study highlights that water bodies currently susceptible to HCBs are likely to become even more vulnerable with climate change compared to those that are currently less susceptible."

In baseball, there is an award called the “Golden Glove” given to the best player in each position. The selection of the Golden Glove winners is based on votes from media personnel such as reporters, broadcast PDs, and commentators, making it difficult to establish clear criteria and important variables for each position. Therefore, the aim of this study is to design a predictive model for the Golden Glove winners based on the statistics of candidates and winners from the Korean professional baseball league between 2003 and 2022, using logistic regression analysis and machine learning techniques. The study also compares and analyzes the performance of the designed predictive models to identify the most suitable model for predicting the Golden Glove winners. The models include logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and XGBoost, with hyperparameters specified for each model. Z-scores, which standardize values, and min-max normalization, which scales values, were used to present the models in two different forms. After optimizing variables, the performance of each model was evaluated.<BR/>  First, in designing the Korean professional baseball Golden Glove prediction model, the logistic regression model used L1, L2, and elasticnet as kernels, the support vector machine model used rbf and poly as kernels, and no significant variables were identified in the nonlinear models. The random forest model used gini and entropy as criteria, and the XGBoost model used exact, approx, and hist as criteria. To increase the F1 score, variables were removed one by one, and the selected variables for each position differed between models.<BR/>  Second, the comparison of the machine learning prediction models revealed that although there were differences in performance across positions, the support vector machine model 2 and XGBoost model showed high prediction accuracy and F1 scores, while the logistic regression and random forest models showed relatively lower accuracy and F1 scores. Overall, the models that were standardized using min-max (model 2) demonstrated better prediction abilities than those standardized using z-scoring (model 1).<BR/>  Therefore, to predict the Golden Glove winners, it is advisable to use the XGBoost model 2 with min-max normalization, and it is believed that including defensive statistics in future models will yield even better results."
Machine Learning Model for Reduction Deformation of Plastic Motor Housing for Automobiles,2024,"['Injection molding', 'Machine learning', 'Optimization', 'Plastic motor housing']",,"The purpose of this paper is to introduce a fusion method that combines the design of experiments (DOE) and machine learning to optimize the bias of plastic products. The study focuses on the plastic motor housing used in automobiles, which is manufactured through plastic injection molding. Achieving optimal molding for the motor housing involves the optimization of various molding conditions, including injection pressure, injection time, holding pressure, mold temperature, and cooling time. Failure to optimize these conditions can lead to increased product deformation. To minimize the deformation of the motor housing, the widely used Taguchi method, which is one of the design of experiment techniques, was employed to identify the injection molding conditions that affect deformation. Machine learning was then applied to various models based on the identified molding conditions. Among the models, the Random Forest model emerged as the most effective in predicting deformation amounts. The validity of the Random Forest model was also confirmed through verification. The verification results demonstrated the excellent prediction accuracy of the trained Random Forest model. By utilizing the validated model, molding conditions that minimize deformation were determined. Implementation of these optimal molding conditions led to a reduction of approximately 5.3% in deformation compared to the conditions before optimization. It is noteworthy that all injection molding outcomes presented in this paper were obtained through robust injection molding simulations, ensuring both research objectivity and speed."

To address this, research has been conducted on water quality prediction techniques utilizing AI technology. This study developed an AI-based predictive model for automating the process control of chlorine disinfection, targeting the prediction of residual chlorine concentration downstream of sedimentation basins in water treatment processes. The AI-based model, which learns from past water quality observation data to predict future water quality, offers a simpler and more efficient approach compared to complex physicochemical and biological water quality models. The model was tested by predicting the residual chlorine concentration downstream of the sedimentation basins at Plant, using multiple regression models and AI-based models like Random Forest and LSTM, and the results were compared. For optimal prediction of residual chlorine concentration, the input-output structure of the AI model included the residual chlorine concentration upstream of the sedimentation basin, turbidity, pH, water temperature, electrical conductivity, inflow of raw water, alkalinity, NH3, etc. as independent variables, and the desired residual chlorine concentration of the effluent from the sedimentation basin as the dependent variable. The independent variables were selected from observable data at the water treatment plant, which are influential on the residual chlorine concentration downstream of the sedimentation basin. The analysis showed that, for Plant, the model based on Random Forest had the lowest error compared to multiple regression models, neural network models, model trees, and other Random Forest models. The optimal predicted residual chlorine concentration downstream of the sedimentation basin presented in this study is expected to enable real-time control of chlorine dosing in previous treatment stages, thereby enhancing water treatment efficiency and reducing chemical costs."

Moreover, the predictive power of spreads varies across different economic conditions, increasing during periods of heightened economic volatility. Our analysis also highlights the persistent influence of spreads on business cycles, extending over a considerable period before and after cyclical turning points.Research Implications – These findings imply that financial market participants should monitor both term spread and credit spread to predict business cycle fluctuations.

Risk Factor Analysis of Cryopreserved Autologous Bone Flap Resorption in Adult Patients Undergoing Cranioplasty with Volumetry Measurement Using Conventional Statistics and Machine-Learning Technique,2024,['Bone flap resorption · Cranioplasty · Random forest · Machine learning'],,"Objective : Decompressive craniectomy (DC) with duroplasty is one of the common surgical treatments for life-threatening increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Once ICP is controlled, cranioplasty (CP) with reinsertion of the cryopreserved autologous bone flap or a synthetic implant is considered for protection and esthetics. Although with the risk of autologous bone flap resorption (BFR), cryopreserved autologous bone flap for CP is one of the important material due to its cost effectiveness. In this article, we performed conventional statistical analysis and the machine learning technique understand the risk factors for BFR.Methods : Patients aged >18 years who underwent autologous bone CP between January 2015 and December 2021 were reviewed. Demographic data, medical records, and volumetric measurements of the autologous bone flap volume from 94 patients were collected. BFR was defined with absolute quantitative method (BFR-A) and relative quantitative method (BFR%). Conventional statistical analysis and random forest with hyper-ensemble approach (RF with HEA) was performed. And overlapped partial dependence plots (PDP) were generated.Results : Conventional statistical analysis showed that only the initial autologous bone flap volume was statistically significant on BFR-A. RF with HEA showed that the initial autologous bone flap volume, interval between DC and CP, and bone quality were the factors with most contribution to BFR-A, while, trauma, bone quality, and initial autologous bone flap volume were the factors with most contribution to BFR%. Overlapped PDPs of the initial autologous bone flap volume on the BRF-A crossed at approximately 60 mL, and a relatively clear separation was found between the non-BFR and BFR groups. Therefore, the initial autologous bone flap of over 60 mL could be a possible risk factor for BFR.Conclusion : From the present study, BFR in patients who underwent CP with autologous bone flap might be inevitable. However, the degree of BFR may differ from one to another. Therefore, considering artificial bone flaps as implants for patients with large DC could be reasonable. Still, the risk factors for BFR are not clearly understood. Therefore, chronological analysis and pathophysiologic studies are needed."

Data Mining Approach to Predicting Soil Moisture Based on Meteorological Factors and Flow Rates,2024,"['deep neural network', 'granger causality test', 'random forest', 'support vector regression', 'time lags']",,"Accurate predictions of the soil moisture, a major limitation related to crop growth, are essential for effective irrigation planning, yield predictions, and proper water resource management. Current attempts to predict soil moisture levels have relied on historical soil moisture data; however, obtaining this type of data can be challenging for farmers engaged in outdoor cultivation. Therefore, this study aimed to predict current soil moisture contents based only on meteorological and flow rate data without previous soil moisture information. To predict the soil moisture, data mining approaches, in this case random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and deep neural network (DNN), were employed. Through the Granger causality test, explanatory variables were determined at different time lags extending to three hours as model inputs for soil moisture predictions. The predictive performance of the models was found to be improved when all meteorological and flow rate data ranging from the previous to the current time could be used as opposed to only data from the current time. The results obtained for the test set showed that the best performance was achieved by the DNN model when it applied explanatory variables from “t” to “t-3” time points with a RMSE of 1.542 and a  value of 0.580. These results can enable real-time soil moisture data monitoring for farmers who currently lack access to soil databases. The constructed model is expected to serve as a framework for future studies that consider various environmental factors, such as soil characteristics, topography, and vegetation patterns"
What factors most significantly predict student satisfaction with K-MOOC?

Framework for hourly demand forecasting of bike-sharing stations: case study of the four main gate areas in Seoul,2024,"['Bike-sharing', 'demand forecasting', 'time-series clustering', 'random forest', 'urban network', 'temperature']",,"Shared bicycles represent a sharing economy for solving complex urban traffic problems. Therefore, their demand has been steadily increasing since the introduction of shared bicycles in Seoul. The demand for shared bicycles is influenced not only by temporal characteristics but also by various factors such as the characteristics of the city, the environment around shared bicycle rental station, and physical urban network. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to discover the factors affecting the demand for shared bicycles and develop models that predict the demand for each shared bicycle rental station over time, reflecting the influence of these factors. In this study, 263 shared bicycle rental stations in the four main gates at the centre of Seoul were classified through time-series clustering analysis, and the demand of each rental station was estimated by time using the random forest method. Consequently, it was found that the amount of rental and return an hour before and the temperature and precipitation an hour before were significant factors in predicting the demand for the next period. Furthermore, it was found that the cluster model considering the characteristics of time-series changes was more accurate than the models that were not cluster-specific. It is expected that future research will monitor the inventory of bicycles at rental stations and establish strategies for relocation using the predicted demand obtained by the framework of the analysis."

The results of the latent growth model analysis to examine the changes in happiness in early adulthood showed a statistically significant decrease in happiness from college students to employed and job seekers, and then to the COVID-19 situation, and confirmed that there were individual differences in the changes in happiness. In addition, the covariance between the initial value and the rate of change was inversely correlated, but statistical significance was not secured. The predictors of happiness in early adulthood were determined by random forest importance index analysis, and 'stress level', 'self-concept/emotional stability', 'overall health', 'suicidal ideation', and 'expectation of living standards in 10 years' were included in the top five variables at all orders based on the amount of node impurity reduction. For the relationship between happiness and these variables, partial dependence plots showed that 'stress level' and 'suicidal ideation' had an inverse linear relationship, and 'self-concept/emotional stability', 'general health', and 'standard of living expectation in 10 years' had a positive linear relationship. Therefore, higher stress level and suicidal ideation predicted lower happiness, while being emotionally stable, having a higher perception of one's general health, and having a higher standard of living expectation in 10 years predicted higher happiness. On the other hand, the distribution of the top 20 variables excluding these variables differed at each level, suggesting that the predictors of happiness may differ depending on the time and environment. Based on these results, we aimed to provide meaningful implications for enhancing happiness in early adulthood."

The random forest technique was used to select variables with high predictive power for school violence victimization. Subsequently, the statistical relationship between the selected variables and school violence victimization was examined using the first difference model. The results showed that, first, psychological characteristics such as depression and negative emotions significantly influenced school violence victimization for both middle and high school students. Second, in middle schools, school characteristics such as school climate and strengthened student guidance and supervision reduced the likelihood of school violence victimization. Third, in high schools, no school characteristics were found to have a positive effect on mitigating students' experience of school violence. This indicates that programs like WEE Class and Cultural and Arts Education activities may function differently at the high school level compared to middle schools. Based on these findings, the study suggests strengthening school violence prevention activities linked with the Student-Centered Integrated Support Project and providing comprehensive support for students with high levels of depression or negative emotions."

Fault Detection of NPC Inverter Based on Ensemble Machine Learning Methods,2024,['Ensemble Machine Learning Methods · Fault detection · NPC inverter · Random forest method'],,"Three-level neutral point clamped (NPC) inverters have been widely adopted in diferent appliances, but their growing use leads to increased susceptibility to faults in the system. It is therefore essential to design precise and efcient methods that can detect inverter faults to ensure optimal control and prevent serious damage to the system. However, the most accurate fault diagnosis methods often require signifcant amounts of time to collect input data such as current and voltage images, or they involve lengthy data rows that are not commonly applicable to real-time applications. To compensate for these drawbacks, ensemble machine learning (EML) methods are proposed to detect open-circuit faults that only require one single point as an input. Moreover, the proposed methods were trained using DC-link voltage diference, time, and three phase currents to improve the accuracy of open-circuit fault detection. The feasibility and efectiveness of the proposed method are verifed through simulation and experimentation. The present work also presents a comprehensive comparison of EML methods. The results show that Random Forest (RF) and Bootstrap Aggregating (bagging) methods achieve high performance compared to other EML methods, with an accuracy of 97%, without requiring additional circuitry. Additionally, the results show that incorporating time and DC-link voltage diferences, along with three-phase current, improves the performance of EML methods."

Job satisfaction, being inherently multidimensional, is examined in the specific occupational contexts of makeup and nail art, with five key variables identified: development of technical competence, opportunities for self-expression, quality of interaction with clients, work-life balance, and job security. To evaluate the relative importance of these variables on job satisfaction, the study employed a Random Forest model and conducted SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to interpret the contributions of individual variables and their interaction patterns. The results reveal that in Shanghai, the development of technical competence is the most influential factor for job satisfaction. In Qingdao, the quality of client interaction outweighs work-life balance, while in Yiwu, opportunities for self-expression emerge as the primary driver of job satisfaction, with job security playing a significant complementary role. The complex effects of interactions among these factors on job satisfaction were further clarified through SHAP analysis. For instance, in Shanghai, technical competence amplifies the positive effects of client interaction quality, whereas in Yiwu, the combination of creative self-expression and job security substantially enhances job satisfaction. These findings provide a robust theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding the key determinants of job satisfaction among makeup and nail art professionals.

Ask1.0 built a scoring model based on a random forest algorithm using 476 high school students' essays as data, and compared the scoring results with human scoring. The scoring model's performance showed an accuracy of .58~.63 in content, organization, and expression, and vocabulary-based features such as 'vocabulary total score' and 'abstraction index' were the most important features that influenced the scoring. In Ask1.0, feedback was provided by extracting relevant features and comparing the extracted features with the average value of the A-grade (writing level) data as an indicator, and by setting key feedback features for each content, organization, and expression area, we aimed to provide specific information on what needs to be improved in student writing. The significance of this study is that it sought to build an optimal scoring model in a small-scale data environment and provide practical feedback on writing performance based on it. Subsequent studies will improve the quality and quantity of training data, and field applications will be conducted to verify the effectiveness of the program and identify further improvements."

It presents a solution to the traditional issues of collaborative filtering such as data sparsity, cold start problem, increased computational complexity, and difficulties in applying big data. We reduce the dimension of the data-matrix greatly, by first utilizing methods from the Random Forest model to predict user preferences for product categories, and in turn using these predictions as a basis for forming groups of users with similar preferences through k-means clustering. We demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the recommendation system with real-world big data from an actual e-commerce company. With our proposed method we were able to create a user specific recommendation system based on the entire dataset of over 7 million transactions with 214,638 unique items, all the while greatly improving computational efficiency by only using 221MB of memory. The results of our study suggest that our proposed collaborative filtering approach combined with machine learning algorithms offers a different perspective in the development of collaborative filtering based recommendation systems, providing new groundwork for future research."

To this end, 223 variables were utilized from the responses of Korean students, parents, teachers, and schools that participated in PISA 2022. Regarding the research model, the top 20 variables predicting grit were identified by applying a mixed-effects random forest technique capable of analyzing multilevel data. Additionally, a causal discovery algorithm based on a structural causal model was employed to generate a causal graph for grit and related variables. The findings follow. First, the primary variables predicting grit were exclusively identified from students’ responses, with most variables pertaining to noncognitive domains such as students’ beliefs, attitudes, emotions, and behaviors. Second, five of the identified variables (i.e. curiosity, emotional control, math efficacy, cooperation, and studying before and after school) had a direct causal effect on grit. By controlling for the causal pathways of related covariates, the pure causal effect between variables could be estimated. The results of this study offer significant implications for the theoretical understanding of the concept of grit and for practical interventions aimed at enhancing grit through a comprehensive comparison and analysis of the relationships between variables that causally influence students grit using large-scale data.Educational Implications : This study is important for educational practice because of the clear method employed to identify the key factors for creating programs to boost grit among young people, such as career counseling and educational activities. To build grit in students, we should work to enhance their noncognitive skills, such as curiosity and self-efficacy, and help them manage their emotions and cooperate with others."

A study of glass and carbon fibers in FRAC utilizing machine learning approach,2024,"['artificial neural network', 'carbon fiber', 'glass fiber', 'M5P Tree-based model', 'Marshall stability', 'random forest', 'support vector machine']",,"Asphalt concrete (AC), is a mixture of bitumen and aggregates, which is very sensitive in the design of flexible pavement. In this study, the Marshall stability of the glass and carbon fiber bituminous concrete was predicted by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and M5P Tree machine learning algorithms. To predict the Marshall stability, nine inputs parameters i.e., Bitumen, Glass and Carbon fibers mixed in 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100 percentage (designated as 100GF:0CF, 75GF:25CF, 50GF:50 CF, 25GF:75CF, 0GF:100CF), Bitumen grade (VG), Fiber length (FL), and Fiber diameter (FD) were utilized from the experimental and literary data. Seven statistical indices i.e., coefficient of correlation (CC), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), relative absolute error (RAE), root relative squared error (RRSE), Scattering index (SI), and BIAS were applied to assess the effectiveness of the developed models. According to the performance evaluation results, Artificial neural network (ANN) was outperforming among other models with CC values as 0.9147 and 0.8648, MAE values as 1.3757 and 1.978, RMSE values as 1.843 and 2.6951, RAE values as 39.88 and 49.31, RRSE values as 40.62 and 50.50, SI values as 0.1379 and 0.2027 and BIAS value as -0.1 290 and -0.2357 in training and testing stage respectively. The Taylor diagram (testing stage) also confirmed that the ANN-based model outperforms the other models. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that the fiber length is the most influential in all nine input parameters whereas the fiber combination of 25GF:75CF was the most effective among all the fiber mixes in Marshall stability."
Prediction of RC T-Beams Shear Strength Based on Machine Learning,2024,"['Reinforced concrete T-beams', 'Shear strength', 'Machine learning (ML)', 'Extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost)', 'Decision tree model (DT)', 'Random forest model (RF)']",,"The contribution of shear resisted by flanges of T-beams is usually ignored in the shear design models even though it was proven by many experimental studies that the shear strength of T-beams is higher than that of equivalent rectangular cross-sections. Ignoring such a contribution result in a very conservative and uneconomical design. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate the capability of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the shear capacity of reinforced concrete T-beams (RCTBs) by incorporating the contribution of the flange. Five machine learning (ML) techniques, which are the Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), are trained and tested using 360 sets of data collected from experimental studies. Among the various machine learning models evaluated, the XGBoost model demonstrated exceptional reliability and precision, achieving an R-squared value of 99.10%. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach is utilized to identify the most influential input features affecting the predicted shear capacity of RCTBs. The SHAP results indicate that the shear span-to-depth ratio (a/d) has the most significant effect on the shear capacity of RCTBs, followed by the ratio of shear reinforcement multiplied by the yield strength of shear reinforcement (), flange thickness (), and flange width (). The accuracy of the XGBoost model in predicting the shear capacity of RCTBs is compared with established codes of practice (ACI 318-19, BS 8110-1:1997, EN 1992-1-2, CSA23.3-04) and existing formulas from researchers. This comparison reinforces the superior reliability and accuracy of the machine learning approach compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface platform is developed, effectively simplifying the implementation of the proposed machine-learning model. The reliability analysis is performed to determine the value of the resistance reduction factor (ϕ) that will achieve a target reliability index (= 3.5)."

Classification of Manners of the Prevocalic Alveolar Consonants in Machine Learning Using Dynamic Formant Transitions of Vowels in Korean Spontaneous Speech,2024,"['coarticulation', 'manner contrasts', 'dynamic formant transitions', 'machine learning']",,"The present study tried to classify the prevocalic manners of alveolar consonants using the formant transitions of the vowel in a Korean spontaneous speech corpus. Random forest and neural network models were trained and tested on selections of F1, F2, and F3 samples taken at the vowel onset and target of the vowel. It was found that prevocalic manners could not be manifested properly by the samples of any one or two formants, taken singly at the vowel onset or doubly at the vowel onset and target. Rather, both models trained on all the F1, F2, and F3 measurements taken doubly at the vowel onset and target, manifested the prevocalic manners robustly, though the random forest model outperformed the neural network model.

Instrumental motivation, intrinsic motivation towards mathematics, self-efficacy in mathematics, and beliefs about intelligence were used as independent variables for prediction based on the data from the second grade of middle school and the first grade of high school. Logistic models, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) models, and Random Forest models were applied, and the optimal prediction model was sought by comprehensively considering various indicators. In the case of using the data from the second grade of middle school, the MLP model showed superior predictive power compared to other models. In the case of using the data from the first grade of high school, all models did not show good predictive power. The model based on the data from the second grade of middle school was deemed to have practical applicability. These results suggest that while the affective domain regarding mathematics is an important factor in the choice of a STEM major, more diverse variables and complex models are needed for predicting majors during high school years. Additionally, while recognizing the limitations of machine learning models, more theoretical discussions are needed on the relationship between major selection and the affective elements of mathematics, and it is hoped that various prediction models will be developed and used in actual practice."

In Korea, the one-dimensional consolidation theory is applied during the design phase, and measurement-based prediction techniques (e.g., the hyperbolic method) are employed during the construction phase. However, these methods are limited because they may not fully reflect the site-specific characteristics or require long-term monitoring. Thus, in this study, ensemble-based deep learning models (i.e., the random forest, gradient boosting machine, XGBoost, and LightGBM models) were developed using the final fill height and ground information to improve the accuracy of the final settlement predictions and analyze the correlations with the input variables. In addition, a database was constructed from the measurement results and borehole data collected from six sites in Busan Port. The prediction results demonstrate that the random forest model achieved the highest accuracy with an average mean absolute error of 0.51 m and a mean absolute percentage error of 8.38%. In addition, the other models demonstrated high performance within specific data distributions; however, they tended to exhibit increased prediction errors when encountering out-of-distribution data. Shapley additive explanations analysis showed that the final fill height, plasticity index, consolidation ratio, clay layer thickness, and natural moisture content were the most significant contributors to predicting the final settlement."

Results indicate that SINDy-based features enabled high classification accuracy, with random forest achieving 97.39% accuracy on the balanced MIT-BIH data. In the binary classification experiments with the PTB-XL dataset, XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy of 92.98%. These findings suggest that differential-equation-based feature extraction offers a promising alternative to traditional ECG classification methods, combining high accuracy with interpretability. Future research will explore refining differential equations to capture complex ECG dynamics more precisely, as well as extending this approach to multicycle ECG patterns to further enhance classification accuracy."

Additionally, we applied the shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method, which is an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique, to identify the covariates that most influenced the prediction of physician visit counts."

This study employed two statistical models from species distribution modeling, namely Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), as well as two machine learning models, Random Forest (RF) and Maximum Entropy Algorithm (MaxEnt). To minimize uncertainties inherent in statistical models, an ensemble model was applied to integrate and address these variabilities. The prediction of potential habitats for Lilium cernuum demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with AUC values exceeding 0.9 across all four models. MaxEnt achieved the highest AUC value (0.983, sd = 0.007), while GAM recorded the lowest (0.903, sd = 0.048). The results revealed that areas with a very high probability of Lilium cernuum distribution are currently concentrated along the Baekdudaegan mountain range, extending from Jirisan National Park in South Korea to the Hamgyeongnam-do region in North Korea, primarily in high-altitude forested areas. By 2070, under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, potential habitats are projected to shift to the Primorskiy region in Russia. These findings suggest that with ongoing climate change, the current potential habitat of Lilium cernuum, primarily located along the Baekdudaegan range on the Korean Peninsula, is expected to contract significantly by 2070, with a concomitant northward migration toward the Central Sikhote-Alin mountain range in the Primorskiy region of Russia, favoring high-altitude forested zones."

This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models to improve the diagnostic performance of MCT for asthma.Methods: Data from 1,501 patients with asthma symptoms who underwent MCT bet-ween 2015 and 2020 were analyzed. The patients were grouped as either the training (80%, n = 1,265) and test sets (20%, n = 236) depending on the time of referral. The conventional model (provocative concentration that causes a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]; PC20 ≤ 16 mg/mL) was compared with the prediction models derived from five ML methods: logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and artificial neural network. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curves (AUPRC) of each model were compared. The prediction models were further analyzed using different input combinations of FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow at 25%–75% of forced vital capacity (FEF25%–75%) values obtained during MCT.Results: In total, 545 patients (36.3%) were diagnosed with asthma. The AUROC of the conventional model was 0.856 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.852–0.861), and the AUPRC was 0.759 (95% CI, 0.751–0.766). All the five ML prediction models had higher AUROC and AUPRC values than those of the conventional model, and random forest showed both highest AUROC (0.950; 95% CI, 0.948–0.952) and AUROC (0.909; 95% CI, 0.905–0.914) when FEV1, FVC, and FEF25%–75% were included as inputs.Conclusions: Artificial intelligence-based models showed excellent performance in asthma prediction compared to using PC20 ≤ 16 mg/mL.

Traditional methods such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) model use clinical factors. This study examined the predictive power of the FRAX score and machine-learning algorithms trained on FRAX parameters.Methods: We analyzed the data of 2,147 female participants from the Ansan cohort study. The FRAX parameters employed in this study included age, sex (female), height and weight, current smoking status, excessive alcohol consumption (>3 units/d of alcohol), and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoporotic fracture was defined as one or more fractures of the hip, spine, or wrist during a 10-year observation period. Machine-learning algorithms, such as gradient boosting, random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression, were employed to predict osteoporotic fractures with a 70:30 training-to-test set ratio. We evaluated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores to assess and compare the performance of these algorithms with the FRAX score.Results: Of the 2,147 participants, 3.5% experienced osteoporotic fractures. Those with fractures were older, shorter in height, and had a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as higher FRAX scores. The AUROC for the FRAX was 0.617. The machine-learning algorithms showed AUROC values of 0.662, 0.652, 0.648, and 0.637 for gradient boosting, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, respectively.Conclusion: This study highlighted the immense potential of machine-learning algorithms to improve osteoporotic fracture risk prediction in women when complete FRAX parameter information is unavailable."

This study analyzes the factors contributing to the regional gap in fertility rates and derives policy implications. The government and local authorities are implementing a range of policies to address the issue of low fertility. To establish an effective strategy, it is essential to identify the primary factors that contribute to regional disparities. This study identifies these factors and explores policy implications through machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence. The study also examines the influence of media and public opinion on childbirth in Korea by incorporating news and online community sentiment, as well as sentiment fear indices, as independent variables. To establish the relationship between regional fertility rates and factors, the study employs four machine learning models: multiple linear regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression. Support Vector Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest significantly outperform linear regression, highlighting the importance of machine learning models in explaining non-linear relationships with numerous variables. A factor analysis using SHAP is then conducted. The unemployment rate, Regional Gross Domestic Product per Capita, Women's Participation in Economic Activities, Number of Crimes Committed, Average Age of First Marriage, and Private Education Expenses significantly impact regional fertility rates. However, the degree of impact of the factors affecting fertility may vary by region, suggesting the need for policies tailored to the characteristics of each region, not just an overall ranking of factors."

VKOSPI, similar to the VIX index in the U.S., reflects market expectations of future volatility and is crucial for risk management and financial derivatives pricing. Traditional forecasting models, such as the Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) model, have been widely used in this domain. However, this research introduces a novel Multi-Input Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which incorporates a wide range of explanatory variables, including general financial variables, stock market fund flows and stock market transaction trend, to improve predictive accuracy.The Multi-Input LSTM model is designed to sequentially process categorized variables through multiple input layers, allowing it to capture complex patterns that are missed by simpler models. The study, based on data from January 2016 to March 2023, compares the forecasting performance of the Multi-Input LSTM with various other machine learning models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and linear models like LASSO and Elastic Net. With a total of 216 explanatory variables, including lagged values, the models are tested across different forecast horizons, including 1 day, 5 days, 10 days, and 22days.The results show that machine learning models, particularly non-linear ones such as LSTM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, outperform the HAR model, especially for longer forecast periods. The Multi-Input LSTM demonstrates superior accuracy, particularly when the variables about stock market transaction and stock market fund flow are included, highlighting their importance in predicting volatility. Furthermore, the study uses rigorous statistical tests to validate the enhanced performance of the Multi-Input LSTM model over traditional approaches.The study contributes to the growing field of machine learning in finance, demonstrating that advanced models like the Multi-Input LSTM can effectively handle the complexities of financial time series data."

In previous research on this topic, a common issue was the arbitrary selection of variables representing individual circumstances, which leads to subjective classification of individual types based on these variables. To address this problem, our study uses machine learning techniques to identify significant circumstances, categorize individual types, and analyze income inequality of opportunity in Korea. Specifically, we employ conditional inference trees and conditional random forest models. The key findings of our study are as follows. First, when comprehensively considering various circumstances, income inequality of opportunity in Korea shows a decreasing trend. Second, parental circumstances, related to parental education statuses, industries in which parents were engaged, and occupational statuses of parents, have substantial impacts on income inequality of opportunity. This supports the validity of existing studies that used parental education as a proxy for circumstances that individuals may experience. Third, the impact of regional factors such as birthplace and the growing place on income inequality of opportunity has increased over time. Last, the structure of income inequality of opportunity in Korea has been more complex over time. Compared to the previous studies, this study has the following advantages. We use machine learning techniques to classify individual types based on data without subjective variable selection.

Furthermore, the dockless system of shared E-Scooters maximizes user convenience through effects such as enhanced integration with public transportation and improved proximity to destinations. However, indiscriminate operation of shared E-Scooter services leads to temporal and spatial imbalances in supply and demand. Short-term demand prediction studies conducted to balance the supply and demand of shared E-Scooters. However, considering aspects of transportation planning such as enhancing intermodal connectivity, there is a need for predictive models that reflect usage patterns of shared E-Scooters over time. This study aims to develop trip generation models by time period and weekday-weekend categories using shared E-Scooter trip data. To model demand patterns over time, shared E-Scooters were divided into overall, weekday peak, weekday non-peak, weekend peak, and weekend non-peak categories to develop trip generation models. The trip generation models primarily consist of factors such as population, centrality, cultural area, and average distances. Unlike the findings of previous studies, factors such as commercial areas, male ratio, and bus stop density were not included in the composition of the shared E-Scooter trip generation model. The results of this study could serve as a reference for future policy-making related to the supply and demand of shared E-Scooters."

Selecting Optimal Algorithms for Stroke Prediction: Machine LearningBased Approach,2024,"['Stroke prediction', 'Machine learning', 'KNHANES', 'XGBoost']",,"In this paper, we compare three models (logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) for predicting stroke occurrence using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). We evaluated these models using various metrics, focusing mainly on recall and F1 score to assess their performance. Initially, the logistic regression model showed a satisfactory recall score among the three models; however, it was excluded from further consideration because it did not meet the F1 score threshold, which was set at a minimum of 0.5. The F1 score is crucial as it considers both precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a model's accuracy. Among the models that met the criteria, XGBoost showed the highest recall rate and showed excellent performance in stroke prediction. In particular, XGBoost shows strong performance not only in recall, but also in F1 score and AUC, so it should be considered the optimal algorithm for predicting stroke occurrence. This study determines that the performance of XGBoost is optimal in the field of stroke prediction."

서식지 기후특성을 고려한 SSP 시나리오에 따른 남방계 식물의 서식지 예측,2024,"['climate  change', 'species  distribution  model', 'southern  lineage  plants', 'habitat  shifts', 'conservation  planning']",,"Climate  change  poses  significant  risks  to  biodiversity  and  ecosystems  globally,  necessitating comprehensive strategies for conservation and adaptation. This study aimed to analyze future habitat changes according to climate characteristics for southern lineage plants distributed in South Korea by applying  SSP  scenarios.  The  study  targeted  southern  lineage  plants  among  the  Korean  Peninsula climate change adaptation target plants of the Korea Forest Service and used 6 bioclimatic variables generated from SSP climate scenario data of Korea Meteorological Administration. In addition, the best model was selected among 10 species distribution models (SDMs). As results of this study, Random Forest (RF) was selected as the final model to be applied. The type classification of southern lineage plants considering climate characteristics was classified into three groups: temperature-sensitive group (15 species), precipitation-sensitive group (7 species), and combined-sensitive group (58 species) using the characteristics of the top two variables with the highest model contribution among six bioclimatic variables. The habitats of all 80 southern lineage plants expanded to the east coast, west coast, and inland in both scenarios, and showed faster changes in the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The variables that had the greatest influence on habitat change were identified as temperature (BIO1) and daily temperature range (BIO2), as well as annual precipitation (BIO12) and precipitation of dry period (BIO14), play an important role in determining the distribution of southern plants. In the temperature-sensitive group, habitats move along the southern region and two coastlines, but in the precipitation-sensitive group, the pattern is distinct, especially the movement toward inland is clearly evident. Different habitat change patterns were observed in each of the three groups, suggesting the possibility of biodiversity redistribution between regions. This study provides valuable insights into the ecological impacts of climate change, emphasizing the need for proactive measures to address the spread of subtropical invasive species and pests. The findings offer a scientific basis for policy development and conservation strategies, particularly in urban and agricultural areas. Future research should integrate additional environmental factors, such as soil properties and human activities, to refine predictions and develop more comprehensive adaptation strategies."

Among these, compost piles are receiving heightened attention as a source of pollution. This study utilized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery for the efficient detection and management of compost. The basic data consisted of multispectral UAV imagery, including Red, Green, Blue, Rededge, and NIR bands, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The analysis compared object-based image analysis with a random forest classifier (OBIA-RF) and deep learning-based instance segmentation using Mask R-CNN. In the accuracy evaluation based on Intersection Over Union (IoU) 75 %, OBIA-RF was analyzed with precision of 0.4356, recall of 0.7273, and F1 score of 0.5128, while Mask R-CNN was analyzed with precision of 0.6923, recall of 0.9818, and F1 score of 0.8120. While OBIA is useful, it shows limitations in handling spatial and spectral data, leading to partial misclassifications within the compost boundaries. Mask R-CNN, in contrast, effectively maintains spatial and contextual data, ensuring more precise identification and delineation of compost piles. This research underscores the potential of UAV-based remote sensing combined with advanced image analysis techniques in environmental management. These methods offer a more efficient and comprehensive alternative to conventional field surveys for monitoring agricultural non-point source pollution."

We used various machine learning techniques, including the random forest classifier (RFC), XGBoost classifier, logistic regression, and their ensemble method (RFC-XGC-LR). The models were developed using recursive feature elimination with crossvalidation for feature selection and evaluated using multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).Results: The 16 items on the HB personality scale were identified as optimal features to predict high HB symptom scores requiring further clinical evaluation. The ensemble model slightly outperformed the other models, with an accuracy of 0.80 and an AUROC of 0.86, in the test set. Notably, item 16 (“I often feel guilty easily ”) of the HB personality scale showed the greatest importance in predicting HB vulnerability across all models. Although all models showed consistent performance across training, validation, and test sets, the RFC model exhibited signs of slight overfitting, with a higher AUROC of 0.97 in the training dataset compared to 0.85 in the validation and 0.86 in the test datasets.Conclusion: Machine learning models, particularly the ensemble method, show capabilities promising for screening individuals with high HB symptom scores based on personality traits, potentially facilitating early referral for clinical evaluation. These models can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the HB risk assessment in clinical settings, potentially aiding early intervention and prevention strategies."
NEURAL  OPERATOR  BASED  REYNOLDS  AVERAGED  TURBULENCE MODELLING,2024,"['The Reynolds-averged Navier-Stokes', 'Neural Operator', 'Fourier Neural Operator', 'Galilean Invariance.']",,"The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are commonly used in industrial applications due to their computational efficiency. However, the linear eddy viscos- ity model (LEVM) used in RANS often fails to accurately capture the anisotropy of Reynolds stress in complex flow conditions. To enhance RANS predictive accuracy, data-driven clo- sure models, such as Tensor Basis Neural Network (TBNN) and Tensor Basis Random Forest (TBRF), have been proposed. However existing models, including TBNN and TBRF, have limitations in capturing the nonlocal patterns of turbulence models, resulting in irregular and unsmooth predictions. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are considered as an alternative approach, but their reliance on discretization poses challenges when dealing with arbitrarily de- signed meshes in RANS simulations. In this study, we propose a nonlinear convolutional neural operator as the RANS closure model. Our model satisfies Galilean invariance, can learn nonlo- cal physics, and recovers high-resolution physics even when trained on undersampled grids. The model outperforms existing TBNN and TBRF models, successfully predicting smooth fields of Reynolds stress in flows with adverse pressure gradients, separations, and streamline curvature, where existing models struggle or fail to provide accurate predictions."

Nationwide spatiotemporal prediction of foot and mouth disease in Iran using machine learning (2008–2018),2024,['Foot-and-mouth disease · Spatiotemporal prediction · Machine learning · Imbalanced classification'],,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals such as sheep, cattle, goats, and buffalo. It is recognized as one of the most destructive animal diseases, primarily attributed to its signifi cant financial impact. We used a machine learning model to predict FMD occurrence at the county level in Iran from 2008 to 2018 using historical data on cases of FMD, so the monthly occurrence of FMD per county was predicted using spatial and temporal lags using the Random Forest (RF) classifier. The cost-sensitive balancing and Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (Borderline SMOTE) methods were also used to handle the imbalanced classification. The results revealed that after applying the cost-sensitive balancing method, the model’s performance, as measured by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, was 81%. However, when we implemented the Borderline SMOTE Oversampling technique, the method performance increased from 81 to 88%. We also found that our proposed model’s performance is better than when we use climate-related features to predict disease occurrence. The methodologies and f indings of this study provide valuable insights for decision-makers to make informed decisions, mitigating county-level FMD occurrences and preventing economic losses."

The subjects were sixth-grade students and their parents from the Third Wave of the 2012 GEPS (Gyeonggi Education Panel Study) and the CSAT English grades from the Tenth Wave follow-up data. Using variables identified as significant in previous studies (learning motivation, class attitudes, understanding of English class, and English academic achievement), this study explored whether these factors predict English grades on the CSAT using the random forest technique and conducted path analysis. The results indicated that 1) the strongest predictor for CSAT English grades was English academic achievement, followed by an understanding of English class. Class attitudes and learning motivation (introjected regulation motivation and intrinsic motivation), which are the main variables of interest derived from previous studies, were also selected as top variables, and path analysis was finally conducted. 2) Analyses of variables’ direct and mediating effects indicated that learning motivation significantly influenced class attitudes and the understanding of English class. Intrinsic motivation positively affected understanding of English class and class attitudes, whereas introjected regulation motivation positively affected understanding of English class but negatively affected class attitudes. Class attitudes affected the understanding of English class and English academic achievement, understanding of English class affected English academic achievement and English grade on the CSAT, and English academic achievement directly affected English grades on the CSAT. As a result, the paths that mediated between introjected regulation motivation and CSAT English grades through class attitudes, understanding of English class, and English academic achievement were nonsignificant, whereas those originating from intrinsic motivation were positive. These findings highlight the importance of promoting intrinsic motivation in elementary English education and the necessity of forming specific class attitudes. Furthermore, early English learning during elementary school can significantly influence subsequent academic achievement."

Leveraging these properties, numerous detection algorithms have been developed and extensively studied. This study proposes a novel approach that detects elliptical shapes and approximates arbitrary objects as ellipses for detection. Using this methodology, the edges of an image are first extracted, a fundamental step in object detection, by dividing the image into small patches for generating machine learning data. The edge extraction process uses random forest machine learning, which provides robustness and efficiency in capturing edge features. Subsequently, object outlines are classified using density-based clustering techniques, enabling the identification of potential objects within the image. These identified objects are subsequently formulated as ellipse candidates using the five-dimensional parametric conic equation of an ellipse for each set of points. Multiple ellipses are generated via least squares ellipse fitting, ensuring a comprehensive representation of object shapes within the image. Finally, rigorous verification processes are employed to select the most suitable ellipse candidates as detection items. Extensive experimentation across five public datasets validates the efficacy of the proposed method, showcasing that objects with diverse shapes can be detected by approximating these shapes as ellipses.

For acquired data from 3,657 survivors and 1,455 deaths, six ML models (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost], light gradient boosting machine, and categorical boosting [CatBoost]) were constructed using fivefold cross-validation to predict mortality. Through these models, 44 clinical variables measured on the day of admission were compared with six sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) components (PaO2/FIO2 [PF], platelets (PLT), bilirubin, cardiovascular, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and creatinine).The confidence interval (CI) was obtained by performing 10,000 repeated measurements via random sampling of the test dataset. All results were explained and interpreted using Shapley’s additive explanations (SHAP).Results: Of the 5,112 participants, CatBoost exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.800 (95% CI, 0.756–0.840) using clinical variables. Using the SOFA components for the same patient, XGBoost exhibited the highest AUC of 0.678 (95% CI, 0.626–0.730). As interpreted by SHAP, albumin, lactate, blood urea nitrogen, and international normalization ratio were determined to significantly affect the results. Additionally, PF and PLTs in the SOFA component significantly influenced the prediction results.Conclusion: Newly established ML-based models achieved good prediction of mortality in patients with sepsis. Using several clinical variables acquired at the baseline can provide more accurate results for early predictions than using SOFA components. Additionally, the impact of each variable was identified."

The dried fruit of four medicinal plant species were used: Cornus officinalis, Lycium chinense, Lycium barbarum, and Schisandra chinensis. Hyperspectral images of the samples were obtained corresponding to 150 wavelength bands in the 400–1000 nm range. For the training dataset, the average reflectance spectrum per berry was extracted. The accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the performance of each classification model. The LR model performed best, with accuracy of 0.99 and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 1 for all samples.

In this respect, the MLML method with 3 layers is proposed. In the fi rst layer, decision tree, random forest, neural network, naive bayes, and support vector machine algorithms are used. After executing this layer, 5 diff erent classifi cation results are transferred to the second layer where k-nearest neighbor algorithm is utilized. In the last layer, the results are improved using the linear regression algorithm. Thanks to our method, images in the input dataset are classifi ed into three groups: cancer, not cancer, and early-stage cancer. The multi-layer architecture is utilized to make joint decisions with diff erent machine learning algorithms and remove the limitations of each algorithm so that more accurate decisions can be made. Fourteen feature extraction algorithms that were not previously used in skin cancer images are employed. Inclusion of age, gender, and region of the lesion in the decision-making process in addition to image features also contributes to obtaining better classifi cation results. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using four metrics. The conducted experiments showed that the MLML technique achieved 88.81% accuracy, 88.89% precision, 99.17% recall, and 93.75% F1-score in classifying skin cancer images. Finally, the results were compared with other relevant studies in the literature to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."

CAN (Controller Area Network) bus technology enables fast and efficient data communication between various electronic devices and systems within a vehicle, providing a platform that integrates and manages a wide range of functions, from core systems to auxiliary features. However, this increased connectivity raises concerns about network security, as external attackers could potentially gain access to the automotive network, taking control of the vehicle or stealing personal information. This paper analyzed abnormal messages occurring in CAN and confirmed that message occurrence periodicity, frequency, and data changes are important factors in the detection of abnormal messages. Through DBC decoding, the specific meanings of CAN messages were interpreted. Based on this, a model for classifying abnormalities was proposed using the GRU model to analyze the periodicity and trend of message occurrences by measuring the difference (residual) between the predicted and actual messages occurring within a certain period as an abnormality metric. Additionally, for multi-class classification of attack techniques on abnormal messages, a Random Forest model was introduced as a multi-classifier using message occurrence frequency, periodicity, and residuals, achieving improved performance. This model achieved a high accuracy of over 99% in detecting abnormal messages and demonstrated superior performance compared to other existing models."
A Machine Learning Approach to ADHD Diagnosis Using Mutual Information and Stacked Classifiers,2024,"['EEG', 'ADHD', 'Machine learning', 'Mutual information', 'PCA', 'Stacked classifier']",,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental conditionin children characterized by impairments in attention, hyperactivity, and impulse control.Despite extensive research, the underlying cause of ADHD remains unclear. Electroen-cephalography (EEG), a noninvasive method for recording brain activity, is valuable forstudying ADHD-related neural patterns. This study explored the potential of EEG data todifferentiate children with ADHD and Healthy Controls (HC) to enhance diagnostic accuracy.We analyzed EEG recordings from 61 children with ADHD and 60 healthy controls. TheEEG data comprised signals from 19 scalp channels. Our primary objective was to develop amachine learning model capable of classifying ADHD subjects with ADHD from HC usingEEG data as discriminatory features. To select the most relevant features, we utilized mutualinformation (MI), a measure of the statistical dependence between two variables. The topfeatures were selected based on their minimum MI values, ensuring that they captured mean-ingful information from both ADHD and HC groups. Principal component analysis (PCA)was employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving the essential features, aiming tomitigate computational complexity. The selected features were then used to train ten differentclassifiers: random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),extra tree classifier (ET), XGBoost (XGB), support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression(LR), adaboost, classification and regression trees (CART), and gradient boosting machines(GBM). A stacked classifier was constructed by combining the outputs of all ten individualclassifiers, with the MLP acting as a meta-classifier. The stacked classifier outperformedindividual models, achieving an impressive accuracy of 92%. Its precision (91%) and sen-sitivity (93%) were also higher than those of the individual models, indicating its ability tocorrectly identify ADHD-positive cases. Furthermore, the specificity of the stacked classifier(93%) was superior, highlighting its improved proficiency in correctly classifying HC. Thiscomprehensive evaluation established the stacked classifier as an effective approach for ADHDclassification, surpassing the performance of several standalone models. Our proposed methodoffers a noninvasive, objective, and cost-effective method for identifying children with ADHD,leading to earlier diagnosis, intervention, and improved treatment outcomes."

Emphasis has been placed on the critical importance of securing a golden time of 5 minutes to effectively respond to such fire incidents and minimize losses. However, achieving timely arrival at fire scenes within this crucial time frame is challenging due to high residential density and increased traffic. Particularly in Seoul, where population density is notably high, the risk of both human casualties and property damage is elevated compared to other regions. Consequently, optimal route selection and efficient spatial deployment of firefighting resources are essential for securing the golden time. This study conducted a comprehensive assessment of fire risk by considering actual fire truck speeds, arrival times, road characteristics, and building features in Seoul using Random Forest and network analysis. We identified areas where achieving the golden time is difficult and fire risk is substantial. Additionally, using kernel density and hot spot analysis, improvement strategies were proposed by selecting optimal locations for fire truck proximity, and the resulting effects were quantitatively analyzed. This study revealed that among the road characteristics, turning frequency impede fire truck speeds during both peak and off-peak hours, and the number of lanes enhance dispatch speed, but the impact difference between the peak and non-peak times was about four times. At the Dong-level, Sa-dang and Jeongneung-dong showed high fire vulnerability based on both peak-hour golden time accessibility and fire risk assessment. At the Gu-level, Gangnam-gu, Gwanak-gu, and Songpa-gu demonstrated heightened vulnerability due to their history of frequent fire incidents. To mitigate fire vulnerability, 17 key improvement areas were identified and then analyzing the effect of fire truck proximity deployment to these locations during peak hours revealed significant enhancement when positioned near Nonhyeon Elementary School, Geumjeong Central Market, and the vicinity of Banghwa Gas Station. This study contributes to understanding how road characteristics impact fire truck response speeds during peak and off-peak times. Furthermore, it provides a quantitative evaluation of implementing measures to secure the golden time and reduce fire risk in vulnerable areas. These results are expected to inform optimal decision-making for emergency fire vehicle operations, considering time frames and road conditions."

Temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation were selected as relevant meteorological variables for solar power prediction. All data was preprocessed by removing their systematic components to use only their residuals and the residual of solar data were further processed with weighted adjustments for homoscedasticity. Four models, MLR (Multiple Linear Regression), RF (Random Forest), DNN (Deep Neural Network), and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), were employed for solar power prediction and their performances were evaluated based on predicted values utilizing observed meteorological data (used as a reference), 1-day-ahead forecast data (referred to as fore1), and 2-day-ahead forecast data (fore2). DNN-based prediction model exhibits superior performance in both regions, with RNN performing the least effectively. However, MLR and RF demonstrate competitive performance comparable to DNN. The disparities in the performance of the four different models are less pronounced than anticipated, underscoring the pivotal role of fitting models using residuals. This emphasizes that the utilized preprocessing approach, specifically leveraging residuals, is poised to play a crucial role in the future of solar power generation forecasting."

It is a technology that allows for the understanding of past and present system operations and the prediction of future states. This study presents a method for modeling four types of facilities using both physics-based and data-driven modeling techniques through digital twins. First, for the battery energy storage system, a physics-based equivalent circuit modeling method was applied to simulate the chemical reactions and electrical relationships of the battery cells through internal parameters.This approach was then expanded to the battery pack level to evaluate the accuracy of the digital twin about the terminal voltage. For the electrolyzers, a physics-based equivalent circuit modeling method was initially used to reflect the electrochemical and thermodynamic characteristics of the electrolysis mechanism. This approach was then expanded from the cell level to the system level, and a data-driven deep neural network model was additionally developed to evaluate the accuracy of the digital twin regarding output voltage. The hydrogen fueling facility was modeled using a physics-based gas equation of state that considers the energy and enthalpy of hydrogen gas. Additionally, a data-driven random forest model was employed to determine the accuracy regarding the internal pressure of the hydrogen tank. Lastly, the electric vehicle charging facility was modeled using a physics-based equivalent circuit model to simulate the nonlinear charging profile, and a data-driven support vector machine model was built to estimate charging demand patterns. The performance of the digital twin modeling for the four facilities was evaluated based on the normalized mean absolute error metric, yielding results of 1.26%, 2.50%, 2.93%, and 5.47%, demonstrating highly favorable outcomes."

This may adversely affect the overall traffic flow by affecting not only autonomous vehicles but also the driving environment of manual vehicles. Therefore, to minimize the traffic problems and adverse effects that may occur in mixed traffic situations involving manual and autonomous vehicles, an autonomous vehicle driving support system based on traffic operation optimization is required. The main purpose of this study was to build a big-data-classification system by specifying data classification to support the self-driving of Lv.4 autonomous vehicles and matching it with spatio-temporal data.METHODS : The research methodology is explained through a review of related literature, and a traffic management index and big-dataclassification system were built. After collecting and mapping the ITS history traffic information data of an actual Living Lab city, the data were classified using the traffic management indexing method. An AI-based model was used to automatically classify traffic management indices for real-time driving support of Lv.4 autonomous vehicles.RESULTS : By evaluating the AI-based model performance using the test data from the Living Lab city, it was confirmed that the data indexing accuracy was more than 98% for the KNN, Random Forest, LightGBM, and CatBoost algorithms, but not for Logistics Regression.The data were severely unbalanced, and it was necessary to classify very low probability nonconformities; therefore, precision is also important. All four algorithms showed similarly good performances in terms of accuracy.CONCLUSIONS : This paper presents a method for efficient data classification by developing a traffic management index to easily fuse and analyze traffic data collected from various institutions and big data collected from autonomous vehicles. Additionally, EdgeRSU is presented to support the driving of Lv.4 autonomous vehicles in mixed autonomous and manual vehicles traffic situations.

The occurrence of hypoxic water masses can drastically alter marine ecosystems and lead to significant socio-economic damage. For the effective management of marine water quality and ecosystems, it is essential to predict changes in DO concentrations and identify the factors influencing the occurrence of hypoxic water masses. This study aims to predict the bottom DO concentrations in the coastal waters near Masan Bay, where the occurrence of hypoxic water masses has recently become a concern. Marine environmental data, hydroclimatic data, ocean current data, and land-based pollution source data were collected for model training. All collected data were combined, missing values were removed, and the data were augmented using a neural network model-based data synthesis method. To mitigate the non-stationarity of the data, the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) was used for data decomposition, and cross wavelet transform (CWT) was normalized to obtain wavelet coherence. These wavelet coherences were compared to select the model input variables. The output variable of the model was set to the bottom DO concentration. The model was trained using random forest regression, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network algorithms. To evaluate the performance of the model, root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), adjusted coefficient of determination (adjusted R²), and correlation coefficient were used. The evaluation results showed that the predictive performance of the models varied; however, the performance was lower in regions with abrupt changes in bottom DO concentrations, and the models only approximated the seasonal variability. In conclusion, this study identified the factors influencing changes in bottom DO concentrations in semi-enclosed coastal bays. Future improvements could enable real-time prediction of hypoxic water mass occurrences, providing early warnings and supporting marine environmental restoration and regulation policies, as well as evaluating the reduction of pollution loads in coastal total maximum daily load (TMDL) management. Furthermore, when integrated with existing numerical models, precise theoretical interpretation of the prediction results is possible. If the data processing methods and the quantity and quality of data are improved, accurate prediction of changes in bottom DO concentrations will be achievable."

This study develops a prediction model for the chloride diffusion coefficient using data from concrete bridges located in marine exposure zones (atmospheric, splash, tidal), an aspect that has not been considered in previous studies. Chloride profile data obtained from these bridge substructures were utilized. After data preprocessing, machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), were optimized through hyperparameter tuning. The performance of these models was developed and compared under three different variable sets. The first model uses six variables: water-to-binder (W/B) ratio, cement type, coarse aggregate volume ratio, service life, strength, and exposure environment.The second model excludes the exposure environment, using only the remaining five variables. The third model relies on just three variables: service life, strength, and exposure environment factors that can be obtained from precision safety diagnostics. The results indicate that including the exposure environment significantly enhances model performance for predicting the chloride diffusion coefficient in concrete bridges in marine environments.Additionally, the three variable model demonstrates that effective predictions can be made using only data from precision safety diagnostics."

One method to increase prediction accuracy is building machine learning models for each cluster which is generally created based on only attribute similarities using cluster analyses. However, spatial data requires clustering to additionally reflect spatial similarities, as considering spatial autocorrelation in a model leads to an increase in prediction accuracy. Therefore, this study explores the impact of spatial clustering with spatial similarities on machine learning prediction accuracy. Specifically, it compares the prediction accuracies of machine learning models generated based on clusters that consider only attribute similarities and those that consider both spatial and attribute similarities. The machine learning techniques employed consist of linear regression model, random forest, and gradient boosting for predicting average daily ridership. The independent variables consist of 11 variables explaining land, population, facility characteristics. The analysis results show that considering both spatial and attribute similarities yields significantly higher prediction accuracy across all models. This study can contribute to the literature on spatial data analyses by demonstrating that considering spatial similarity can improve prediction accuracy when applying spatial data to machine learning."

The existence of spatial heterogeneity often violates the assumption that sub-study areas have the same population, necessitating the creation of local machine learning models. Subway ridership also exhibits spatial heterogeneity, and creating local models based on the composition of spatially similar regions could improve prediction accuracies. This study explores the impact of spatially constrained hierarchical clustering on the prediction accuracy of machine learning models. Specifically, the prediction accuracies are compared between models created for each cluster and the entire model by varying the number of clusters. Subway ridership is utilized as the response variable, and the machine learning techniques employed are linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting. The results indicate that as the number of clusters increases, the prediction accuracy of the cluster model tends to exceed that of the entire model across most techniques. However, when the number of clusters exceeds a certain threshold, this tendency remains constant, highlighting the necessity of estimating the appropriate number of clusters to improve prediction accuracy. This study is expected to provide a research base for enhancing spatial machine learning by investigating the impact spatially constrained hierarchical cluster-based machine learning models."
A Method for Generating Malware Countermeasure Samples Based on Pixel Attention Mechanism,2024,"['Malware', 'Generative Adversarial Networks', 'Deep Learning', 'Pixel Attention Mechanism', 'Adversarial Samples']",,"Studies have shown that malware has become a primary means of attacking the Internet. Therefore, adversarial samples have become a vital breakthrough point for studying malware. By studying adversarial samples, we can gain insights into the behavior and characteristics of malware, evaluate the performance of existing detectors in the face of deceptive samples, and help to discover vulnerabilities and improve detection methods for better performance. However, existing adversarial sample generation methods still need help regarding escape effectiveness and mobility. For instance, researchers have attempted to incorporate perturbation methods like Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and others into adversarial samples to obfuscate detectors. However, these methods are only effective in specific environments and yield limited evasion effectiveness. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a malware adversarial sample generation method (PixGAN) based on the pixel attention mechanism, which aims to improve adversarial samples' escape effect and mobility. The method transforms malware into grey-scale images and introduces the pixel attention mechanism in the Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) model to weigh the critical pixels in the grey-scale map, which improves the modeling ability of the generator and discriminator, thus enhancing the escape effect and mobility of the adversarial samples. The escape rate (ASR) is used as an evaluation index of the quality of the adversarial samples. The experimental results show that the adversarial samples generated by PixGAN achieve escape rates of 97%, 94%, 35%, 39%, and 43% on the Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network (CNN_RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory (CNN_LSTM) algorithmic detectors, respectively."
Using Machine Learning Models to  Identify Factors Associated With  30-Day Readmissions After Posterior  Cervical Fusions: A Longitudinal  Cohort Study,2024,"['Machine learning', 'Predictive modeling', 'Readmission', 'Spine', 'Costs', 'Posterior cervical fusion']",,"Objective: Readmission rates after posterior cervical fusion (PCF) significantly impact patients and healthcare, with complication rates at 15%–25% and up to 12% 90-day readmission rates. In this study, we aim to test whether machine learning (ML) models that capture interfactorial interactions outperform traditional logistic regression (LR) in identifying readmission-associated factors.Methods: The Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database was used to identify patients who underwent PCF between 2004–2017. To determine factors associated with 30-day readmissions, 5 ML models were generated and evaluated, including a multivariate LR (MLR) model. Then, the best-performing model, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), was compared to the LACE (Length patient stay in the hospital, Acuity of admission of patient in the hospital, Comorbidity, and Emergency visit) index regarding potential cost savings from algorithm implementation.Results: This study included 4,130 patients, 874 of which were readmitted within 30 days.When analyzed and scaled, we found that patient discharge status, comorbidities, and number of procedure codes were factors that influenced MLR, while patient discharge status, billed admission charge, and length of stay influenced the GBM model. The GBM model significantly outperformed MLR in predicting unplanned readmissions (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.846 vs. 0.829; p < 0.001), while also projecting an average cost savings of 50% more than the LACE index.Conclusion: Five models (GBM, XGBoost [extreme gradient boosting], RF [random forest], LASSO [least absolute shrinkage and selection operator], and MLR) were evaluated, among which, the GBM model exhibited superior predictive performance, robustness, and accuracy. Factors associated with readmissions impact LR and GBM models differently, suggesting that these models can be used complementarily. When analyzing PCF procedures, the GBM model resulted in greater predictive performance and was associated with higher theoretical cost savings for readmissions associated with PCF complications."

For the development of the AI model, 53,432 pitches judged as ball/strike from March 9, 2024, to May 29, 2024, in KBO were collected. The AI model based on the Random Forest algorithm demonstrated excellent predictive performance with an accuracy of 97.99%, precision of 96.62%, recall of 96.29%, F1 score of 96.46%, and AUC of 98.91%. The analysis through TTA, which involved altering the stadium information for each team, revealed that the average consistency for all teams ranged from 0.981 to 0.983. This confirmed that the AI model maintained consistent performance even when the stadium changed. The standard deviation was very low, ranging from 0.003 to 0.005, indicating minimal variation in ball/strike judgments across different stadiums. The pitches where TTA predictions failed were primarily at the upper and lower boundaries of the strike zone.

Without appropriate maintenance, the performance of aging structures can deteriorate, diminishing their utility. Predicting the safety performance of these structures with time characteristics is an effective strategy for maintenance planning and can  appropriately pre-determine the duration and cost for their safety performance. This research predicts the safety grade of domestic road facilities including bridges, tunnels, and retaining walls. A database for each facility type was constructed to perform the safety performance evaluations, detailed safety inspections, and precision safety diagnostics. Ordinary bridges, NATM tunnels, and reinforced concrete retaining walls were selected since they are the most common structural types in the database. The safety grade prediction model was developed based on machine learning techniques considering the service life of the structures. Three regression-based machine learning algorithms were used to develop an optimal prediction model: decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The accuracy and confusion matrix for the three machine learning models were compared. In the comparative results, the XGBoost model resulted in the highest accuracy of 100 % for the road bridges, road tunnels, and retaining walls, effectively reflecting the time characteristics."
Impact of Esophageal Motility on Microbiome Alterations in Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Patients With Negative Endoscopy: Exploring the Role of Ineffective Esophageal Motility and Contraction Reserve,2024,"['Contraction reserve', 'Esophageal motility disorders', 'High-resolution manometry', 'Ineffective esophageal motility', 'Microbiota']",,"Background/AimsIneffective esophageal motility (IEM) is common in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and can be associated with poor esophageal contraction reserve on multiple rapid swallows. Alterations in the esophageal microbiome have been reported in GERD, but the relationship to presence or absence of contraction reserve in IEM patients has not been evaluated. We aim to investigate whether contraction reserve influences esophageal microbiome alterations in patients with GERD and IEM.MethodsWe prospectively enrolled GERD patients with normal endoscopy and evaluated esophageal motility and contraction reserve with multiple rapid swallows during high-resolution manometry. The esophageal mucosa was biopsied for DNA extraction and 16S ribosomal RNA gene V3-V4 (Illumina)/full-length (Pacbio) amplicon sequencing analysis.ResultsAmong the 56 recruited patients, 20 had normal motility (NM), 19 had IEM with contraction reserve (IEM-R), and 17 had IEM without contraction reserve (IEM-NR). Esophageal microbiome analysis showed a significant decrease in microbial richness in patients with IEM-NR when compared to NM. The beta diversity revealed different microbiome profiles between patients with NM or IEM-R and IEM-NR (P = 0.037). Several esophageal bacterial taxa were characteristic in patients with IEM-NR, including reduced Prevotella spp. and Veillonella dispar, and enriched Fusobacterium nucleatum. In a microbiome-based random forest model for predicting IEM-NR, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 was yielded.ConclusionsIn symptomatic GERD patients with normal endoscopic findings, the esophageal microbiome differs based on contraction reserve among IEM. Absent contraction reserve appears to alter the physiology and microbiota of the esophagus."

We performed a study to compare taxonomic profiles of gut microbiota of ED and healthy males.Materials and Methods: A total of 43 ED patients and 16 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) with a cutoff value of 21 was used to evaluate erectile function. All participants underwent nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity test. Samples of stool were sequenced to determine the gut microbiota.Results: We identified a distinct beta diversity of gut microbiome in ED patients by unweighted UniFrac analysis (R2=0.026, p=0.036). Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfse) analysis showed Actinomyces was significantly enriched, whereas Coprococcus_1, Lachnospiraceae_FCS020_group, Lactococcus, Ruminiclostridium_5, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG_002 were depleted in ED patients. Actinomyces showed a significant negative correlation with the duration of qualified erection, average maximum rigidity of tip, average maximum rigidity of base, tip tumescence activated unit (TAU), and base TAU. Coprococcus_ 1, Lachnospiraceae_FCS020_group, Ruminiclostridium_5, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG_002 were significantly correlated with the IIEF-5 score. Ruminiclostridium_5 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG_002 were positively related with average maximum rigidity of tip, average maximum rigidity of base, ΔTumescence of tip, and Tip TAU. Further, a random forest classifier based on the relative abundance of taxa showed good diagnostic efficacy with an area under curve of 0.72.Conclusions: This pilot study identified evident alterations in the gut microbiome composition of ED patients and found Actinomyces was negatively correlated with erectile function, which may be a key pathogenic bacteria."

This analysis is particularly relevant given the growing emphasis on learner identity in global education. First, to predict the self-management capabilities of these students, eight machine learning regression models—Linear Regression, SVR, KNN, GBM, Bagging Regressor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost—were compared. XGBoost was identified as the most effective model, demonstrating low errors and high explanatory power. Next, the selected XGBoost model was applied to analyze the importance of variables in predicting self-management competency, using the Gain value as the evaluation criterion. It was analyzed that ‘setting a goal (meta-cognition) and studying while thinking about that goal’, ‘(attitude to work) even if it is difficult, I will choose what I like’, and ‘(meta-cognition) I can find and do what I need or task’ are relatively important variables compared to other variables. Additionally, a partial dependence plot was generated to examine the correlation between explanatory variables and response variables. It can be inferred that higher levels of metacognition and a more positive attitude toward work are associated with greater self-management abilities among general high school students."

Ensemble Based Optimal Feature Selection Algorithm for Efficient Intrusion Detection in Wireless Sensor Network,2024,"['IDS', 'Ensemble method', 'feature selection', 'sensor network', 'filter method', 'decision tree.']",,"Wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of large number of sensor nodes that are deployed in geographical locations to collect sensed information, process data and communicate it to the control station for further processing. Due the unfriendly environment where the sensors are deployed, there exist many possibilities of malicious nodes which performs malicious activities in the network. Therefore, the security threats affect performance and life time of sensor networks, whereas various security aspects are there to address security issues in WSN namely Cryptography, Trust Management, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). However, IDS detect the malicious activities and produce an alarm.These malicious activities exploit vulnerabilities in the network layer and affect all layers in the network. Existing feature selection methods such as filter-based methods are not considering the redundancy of the selected features and wrapper method has high risk of overfitting the classification of intrusion. Due to overfitting, the classification algorithm fails to detect the intrusion in better manner. The main objective of this paper is to provide the efficient feature selection algorithm which was suitable for any type classification algorithm to detect the intrusion in an effective manner. This paper, the security of the network is addressed by proposing Feature Selection Algorithm using Chi Squared with Ensemble Method (FSChE). The proposed scheme employs the combination of decision tree along with the random forest classification algorithm to form ensemble classifier. The experimental results justify the feasibility of the proposed scheme in terms of attack detection, packet delivery ratio and time analysis by employing NSL KDD cup data Set. The obtained results shows that the proposed ensemble method increases the overall performance by 10% to 25% with respect to mentioned parameters."

Volunteers were recruited to rate beauty perception for a subset of SVIs to create a dataset. This dataset was used to train a random forest model to predict beauty perception scores for all SVIs in the study area. Additionally, we examined the impact of streetscape visual elements on beauty perception.The results reveal an uneven spatial distribution of streetscape visual elements and distinct differences in beauty perception between residents and tourists. Korean residents generally perceive greater beauty and show a preference for modernized, bustling commercial environments, while Chinese tourists favor areas that combine greenery with historical and cultural features. Elastic Net Regression results indicate the strongest positive correlation with beauty perception for both groups is with trees, while buildings and walls exhibit negative correlations. These findings provide valuable references for street planning and design, offering scientific support for future urban street evaluation and spatial optimization and promoting the growth of urban tourism."

CAN (Controller Area Network) bus technology enables fast and efficient data communication between various electronic devices and systems within a vehicle, providing a platform that integrates and manages a wide range of functions, from core systems to auxiliary features. However, this increased connectivity raises concerns about network security, as external attackers could potentially gain access to the automotive network, taking control of the vehicle or stealing personal information. This paper analyzed abnormal messages occurring in CAN and confirmed that message occurrence periodicity, frequency, and data changes are important factors in the detection of abnormal messages. Through DBC decoding, the specific meanings of CAN messages were interpreted. Based on this, a model for classifying abnormalities was proposed using the GRU model to analyze the periodicity and trend of message occurrences by measuring the difference (residual) between the predicted and actual messages occurring within a certain period as an abnormality metric. Additionally, for multi-class classification of attack techniques on abnormal messages, a Random Forest model was introduced as a multi-classifier using message occurrence frequency, periodicity, and residuals, achieving improved performance. This model achieved a high accuracy of over 99% in detecting abnormal messages and demonstrated superior performance compared to other existing models."

Therefore, it is crucial to swiftly identify the chemical substance involved in an incident and respond appropriately when such incidents occur. Conventional studies on chemical substance identification have utilized chemical sensors and visual information. However, methods based on chemical sensors are challenging to apply when sensors are unavailable, and approaches relying on visual information face difficulties in detecting substances with identical or colorless characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel artificial intelligence-based hazardous chemical detection system using spectral spectrum data to address the challenge of distinguishing hazardous chemicals with the same color or those that are colorless. The paper introduces a technique for constructing artificial intelligence training data and a hazardous chemical detection model based on spectral spectrum data. The proposed artificial intelligence training data construction method improved the accuracy of data extraction by applying clustering to raw spectral spectrum data for extraction. Additionally, based on the extracted data and reflecting the characteristics of material spectral spectrum data, we proposed a hazardous chemical detection model implemented using the random forest algorithm. We validated the performance of the model through in-house experiments. The AI-based hazardous chemical detection system proposed in this paper is expected to minimize the damage from chemical incidents through rapid identification, even in cases where hazardous chemicals lack visual characteristics, enabling proactive response measures."

Based on the purpose of the study, the group was divided into two groups(g1: job seekers or the employed, g2: graduate students) in accordance with the characteristics of the data. Next, to find out which variables affect the prediction of college graduates’ career status through creating a prediction model, not only were classic statistical models created using logistic regression and discriminant analysis, but machine learning models were also made using the Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random forest, and XGboost algorithms. In a consequence of the analysis, the SVM prediction models turned out to be the best prediction rates(82.12%). Therefore, the final predictive model was decided to SVM model, and it was analyzed to the main predictive variables from the SVM model. Thus, the top predictive variable was the number of people who could call for the help belonging to personal environmental factors. It means personal feature factors were the key factors predicting college graduates’ career status. Therefore, it is necessary to examine how personal feature factors(intelligence, values, competencies) affect their careers. Furthermore, the importance of social relationships in college graduates’ careers needs to be reexamined as social relationships were the key factors in all the machine learning models."

An effective way to prevent dropouts is to predict students at risk of dropping out early and provide them with focused management and support programs. There have been studies on predicting dropouts using machine learning algorithms, but there are limitations to their practical application in various universities, such as small dataset size and insufficient performance. In this paper, we propose a college student dropout prediction system that can be practically utilized. To ensure the universal application of the proposed model, training features are selected from basic academic data. A dataset of 54,771 samples was used, and a prediction model was developed for the prediction period of one to four semesters by considering long-term prediction for early detection of at-risk students. The random forest and gradient boosting models achieved AUC scores of about 0.92 to 0.98. Short-term predictions showed excellent performance a precision of more than 0.83 at recall of 0.8 and, and long-term predictions also showed high predictive power with F1 scores of 0.64 to 0.72, confirming its practical application. In addition, we synthesized the prediction results by period and suggested practical applications in student information system."

In South Korea, the number of heat-related illnesses has exceeded fatalities from heavy rain and typhoons, showing a growing trend. Thus, proactive measures are urgently needed. This study aimed to predict the number of heat-related illness occurrence using sociodemographic and meteorological factors from 229 districts in South Korea. Data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (2021–2023), including heat-related illness cases, 24 of 35 sociodemographic variables and 32 of 70 meteorological variables, were anlyzed for model development. A prediction model was built using machine learning models (Ridge, Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, LightGBM) to forecast the number of heat-related illnesses per 100,000 people. The XGBoost model (R² = 0.76) showed the highest explanatory power. Sociodemographic factors such as non-urban population (%), apartment housing area (%), nursing medical institutions status, and population over 65 years old (%) were the most important variables contributing to the increased occurrence of heat-related illnesses. Among meteorological variables, variables indicating sustained high temperatures, such as consecutive days with minimum temperature ≥ 25°C and cumulative days with maximum temperature ≥ 29°C, showed higher importance. These results emphasize that the number of heat-related illnesses is influenced not only by social systems and structures, but also by combined effects of vulnerable populations and meteorological factors. Thus, comprehensive strategies addressing both sociodemographic and meteorological factors are needed for effective prevention."

Method: Following the guidelines of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses), a total of 17 articles (16 on muscular strength and 12 on muscle hypertrophy, with 11 duplicates) were finally selected for inclusion through literature search and selection process. By applying meta-analysis as the research method, it was confirmed heterogeneity of effect sizes, mean effect size, and publication bias.   Results: A moderate level of heterogeneity (I²=43.2%) among studies was confirmed for muscular strenth, and a mean effect size of 0.54 was calculated using a random effect model. Through a funnel plot and Egger test, the absence of publication bias (p >.05) was confirmed. It was concluded that higher-load training is more effective for improving muscular strength compared to lower-load training. For muscle hypertrophy, the absence of heterogeneity (I2=0%) among studies was confirmed, and a mean effect size of 0.021 was calculated using a fixed-effect model. There was no publication bias (p >.05), and it was observed that the improvement of muscle hypertrophy showed similar exercise intervention effects between higher-load and lower-load training.  Conclusion: It was concluded that while muscular strength aligns closely with the existing guidelines of the ACSM, muscle hypertrophy can also be similarly improved with lower-load training compared to higher-load training."
