Machine Learning-Based Mapping of Daily Methane Concentration in Rice Paddies Using Meteorological Data and Satellite Images: A Case of South Korea,2024,"['Methane emission', 'Rice paddy', 'Machine learning', 'Meteorological data', 'Satellite image']",,"Methane from rice fields has a strong greenhouse effect and its accurate estimation is essential to combat climate change. In this study, we conducted an analysis based on the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model using Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from VIIRS and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and FluxNet ground observations of the Cheorwon rice paddy region. This was used to estimate methane emissions from rice paddy fields in South Korea and to create a gridded spatial information map of methane concentrations. Using data with a spatial resolution of 1.5 kilometers, we identified detailed changes within the region and generated daily maps to analyze daily changes and seasonal characteristics. To predict methane concentration, we considered the correlation between meteorological factors such as latent heat flux, humidity, soil moisture, and soil temperature and methane emissions as key variables. Latent heat flux and humidity were selected as key variables considering that the migration of methane gas is affected by the evapotranspiration process. In addition, soil moisture, which creates the anaerobic conditions necessary for methane production, and soil temperature, which affects the activity of methanogenic microorganisms, were included in the analysis. Taking these various factors into consideration, we analyzed methane emission data from rice fields in Korea and visualized them on a map to understand the pattern of methane production in response to changing weather conditions. The developed model showed a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 28.97 in the 5-fold cross-validation and an average correlation coefficient of 0.87 and MAE of 35.46 in the Leave One Year Out (LOYO) cross-validation. These results are expected to contribute to the understanding of methane generation patterns under changing weather conditions and accurate methane emission estimation. In addition, the developed model and the constructed methane concentration map can be utilized as an important basis for establishing greenhouse gas reduction policies in the agricultural sector and effective climate change response strategies in the future."

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating R&D efficiency. However, traditional DEA models heavily rely on the selection of input and output variables, which can limit their effectiveness. To overcome this dependency and improve the robustness of DEA, this study proposes a novel methodology that integrates machine learning techniques with DEA for determining the most suitable input and output variables.

Those with fractures were older, shorter in height, and had a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as higher FRAX scores. The AUROC for the FRAX was 0.617. The machine-learning algorithms showed AUROC values of 0.662, 0.652, 0.648, and 0.637 for gradient boosting, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, respectively.Conclusion: This study highlighted the immense potential of machine-learning algorithms to improve osteoporotic fracture risk prediction in women when complete FRAX parameter information is unavailable."
Development of a Real-Time Anomaly Detection System for Dry Vacuum Pumps Using Low-Cost IoT Devices and Machine Learning,2024,"['Anomaly detection', 'Machine learning', 'IoT device', 'Low-cost', 'Vacuum pump']",,"Data-driven health diagnosis methods based on machine learning have been receiving a lot of attention with the hope that they can open a new era for mechanical researchers and engineers. Machine learning algorithms including deep learning can show insights or state trends through complicated electro-mechanical sensor signals, but it is difficult for machine learning algorithms to go beyond the given data boundaries and to generalize their inferring rules from one case to the other. Researchers have even artificially damaged common mechanical parts in their experiments to collect fault signals for machine learning training. Creating and gathering the sensor signals covering a variety of machine status may be time-consuming or impossible in reality. Anomaly detection for dry vacuum pumps started from the recognition that the artificially induced fault signals may not reflect the natural malfunctioning state of the pumps. Anomaly detection algorithms use only normal data for training, so abnormal state data is not necessarily required. In this research several anomaly detection algorithms were tested and compared with time-domain input features and frequency-domain input features when acceleration signals were injected in for training. A long short-term memory based autoencoder (LSTM-autoencoder) scheme with discrete wavelet transformed (DWT) input signals was chosen for the finalist due to its superior capability capturing the nature of normal state characteristics. The output of LSTM-autoencoder’s loss could be used as an indicator of the machine’s health deterioration. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated that the developed algorithm worked well on low-cost Internet of Things devices such as Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino Mega 2560 boards for real-time monitoring."

Prediction of RC T-Beams Shear Strength Based on Machine Learning,2024,"['Reinforced concrete T-beams', 'Shear strength', 'Machine learning (ML)', 'Extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost)', 'Decision tree model (DT)', 'Random forest model (RF)']",,"The contribution of shear resisted by flanges of T-beams is usually ignored in the shear design models even though it was proven by many experimental studies that the shear strength of T-beams is higher than that of equivalent rectangular cross-sections. Ignoring such a contribution result in a very conservative and uneconomical design. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate the capability of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the shear capacity of reinforced concrete T-beams (RCTBs) by incorporating the contribution of the flange. Five machine learning (ML) techniques, which are the Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), are trained and tested using 360 sets of data collected from experimental studies. Among the various machine learning models evaluated, the XGBoost model demonstrated exceptional reliability and precision, achieving an R-squared value of 99.10%. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach is utilized to identify the most influential input features affecting the predicted shear capacity of RCTBs. The SHAP results indicate that the shear span-to-depth ratio (a/d) has the most significant effect on the shear capacity of RCTBs, followed by the ratio of shear reinforcement multiplied by the yield strength of shear reinforcement (), flange thickness (), and flange width (). The accuracy of the XGBoost model in predicting the shear capacity of RCTBs is compared with established codes of practice (ACI 318-19, BS 8110-1:1997, EN 1992-1-2, CSA23.3-04) and existing formulas from researchers. This comparison reinforces the superior reliability and accuracy of the machine learning approach compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface platform is developed, effectively simplifying the implementation of the proposed machine-learning model. The reliability analysis is performed to determine the value of the resistance reduction factor (ϕ) that will achieve a target reliability index (= 3.5)."

Although several non-destructive computer vision-based systems have been developed for this purpose, the infl uence of diff erent colour spaces on machine-learning model performance dur ing the ripeness stage classifi cation of strawberries remains underexplored. In this context, three machine-learning models, namely Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), support vector machine (SVM) and feed-forward artifi cial neural networks (FANN), were combined with four colour spaces (RGB, HLS, CIELab and YCbCr) and biometrical characteristics to evaluate the eff ectiveness of colour spaces on the performance of machine-learning models for classifying strawberry ripeness. For this purpose, 1210 samples were collected and manually classifi ed into four ripeness stages. A dataset was created by combining each colour space value, biometrical properties, and corresponding ripeness stage, which was used as inputs to the models.The results indicated that FANN with CIELab colour space achieved the highest accuracy of 96.7%, followed by GNB and SVM, both having equal accuracy of 95.46% in CIELab colour space. The least accuracy of 92.15% was observed in RGB colour space with the GNB classifi er.

This study proactively identifies the risk of student loan defaults and analyzes the key causal factors for it in order to suggest policies that enhance financial stability. To this end, this study utilizes data from the Korea Student Aid Foundation (KOSAF), a national institution, and, using various machine learning models, constructs a model to predict student loan default. The analysis applies the Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM models, thereafter using SHAP analysis to interpret the factors influencing loan defaults. The key results reveal that the CatBoost model demonstrates superior performance, depending on the type of school and loan. Key risk factors for higher default risk included being a student of humanities, social sciences, Art and Physical Education and education; being male; and securing grades below 80. Conversely, the factors that reduced default risk included studying Medical Science, attending metropolitan universities, having grades above 90, and being under 24. Based on these findings, policies for loan screening and delinquency management are suggested to enhance financial stability. This study emphasizes the use of machine learning techniques and explainable AI (XAI) models to improve the accuracy of student loan default predictions and provide valuable policy insights. This study adds to existing literature by identifying the factors for both direct and incomecontingent loan default."

The ultimate goal of this article is to provide a big data analysis of 330 reviews of the movie Noryang and to evaluate the Naive Bayes model, the Random Forests model, the DNN model, and the LSTM model in machine learning and deep learning. A point to note is that the name Yi, Sun-shin was the most widely used by viewers, followed by the word movie, and the word general, in that order. A major point of this article is that the name Yi, Sun-shin and the word movie showed up twice as the first keyword. This in turn implies that these keywords are the most noteworthy ones. The sentiment analysis argues that about 75% of viewers think of the film as well-made and that they were highly satisfied with it. In this paper, we used the Naive Bayes model, the Random Forests model, the DNN model, and the LSTM model and made them predict whether each review is positive or negative. The Random Forests model works well for our data, whereas the Naive Bayes model does not. When learning took place 25 times, the DNN model worked well for our data (its accuracy rate is 82.76%). When it comes to the LSTM model, its accuracy did not improve even though learning took place 9 times. Yet, the LSTM model is slightly better than the DNN model with respect to the accuracy rate of test data."

If mortality rates in patients with sepsis can be predicted early, medical resources can be allocated efficiently. We constructed machine learning (ML) models to predict the mortality of patients with sepsis in a hospital emergency department.Methods: This study prospectively collected nationwide data from an ongoing multicenter cohort of patients with sepsis identified in the emergency department. Patients were enrolled from 19 hospitals between September 2019 and December 2020. For acquired data from 3,657 survivors and 1,455 deaths, six ML models (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost], light gradient boosting machine, and categorical boosting [CatBoost]) were constructed using fivefold cross-validation to predict mortality. Through these models, 44 clinical variables measured on the day of admission were compared with six sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) components (PaO2/FIO2 [PF], platelets (PLT), bilirubin, cardiovascular, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and creatinine).The confidence interval (CI) was obtained by performing 10,000 repeated measurements via random sampling of the test dataset. All results were explained and interpreted using Shapley’s additive explanations (SHAP).Results: Of the 5,112 participants, CatBoost exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.800 (95% CI, 0.756–0.840) using clinical variables. Using the SOFA components for the same patient, XGBoost exhibited the highest AUC of 0.678 (95% CI, 0.626–0.730). As interpreted by SHAP, albumin, lactate, blood urea nitrogen, and international normalization ratio were determined to significantly affect the results. Additionally, PF and PLTs in the SOFA component significantly influenced the prediction results.Conclusion: Newly established ML-based models achieved good prediction of mortality in patients with sepsis. Using several clinical variables acquired at the baseline can provide more accurate results for early predictions than using SOFA components.

However, security vulnerabilities and performance limitations remain significant challenges in IoT blockchain networks. This work proposes a novel approach that combines transaction representation and machine learning techniques to address these challenges. Various clustering techniques, including k-means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Hierarchical clustering, were employed to effectively group unlabelled transaction data based on their intrinsic characteristics. Anomaly transaction prediction models based on classifiers were then developed using the labelled data. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure were used to identify the minority class representing specious transactions or security threats. The classifiers were also evaluated on their performance using balanced and unbalanced data. Compared to unbalanced data, balanced data resulted in an overall average improvement of approximately 15.85% in accuracy, 88.76% in precision, 60% in recall, and 74.36% in F1-score. This demonstrates the effectiveness of each classifier as a robust classifier with consistently better predictive performance across various evaluation metrics. Moreover, the k-means and GMM clustering techniques outperformed other techniques in identifying security threats, underscoring the importance of appropriate feature selection and clustering methods. The findings have practical implications for reinforcing security and efficiency in real-world IoT blockchain networks, paving the way for future investigations and advancements."

Quality inspection of micro-holes is costly and redrilling defective holes can lead to imperfection owing to the misalignment in re-aligning the removed specimens. Thus this paper proposes an in-situ, automatic inspection method using photodiode data and machine learning models to detect defects in real-time during the fabrication of SK5 steel plates with 1064 nm Nd:YAG Laser machines to reduce the workload and increase the quality of products. Further, it explores the possibility of generalizing the models to 51 different scenarios of fabrication by classifying unseen data into 51 classes. A dataset of around 1,500,000 time series data points was generated using an optical probe while drilling over 56,000 holes into test specimens. 15 different combinations of thickness and diameter were drilled using suggested parameters. An additional 12 potential defect-prone conditions were designed to obtain data during conditional drilling. Hole quality was measured for each hole using OGP 3D profile microscope measuring machine.

Machine learning force field based phonon dispersion prediction,2024,,,"First-principles calculations on phonon dynamics using density functional theory (DFT) have proven powerful in estimating the phonon dispersion of crystalline structures. However, it remains a challenging task for defective structures due to the computational cost. The main computational bottleneck of the phonon calculation is obtaining the interatomic force constants in many supercells with different configurations of displacements. Here, we employed a machine learning-based force fields (MLFFs) to accelerate DFT calculations of interatomic force constants of Si-doped HfO2. We find that the specific phonon band originated from ferroelectric phase disappears, and imaginary modes are enhanced upon the introduction of a 10 % concentration of Si dopants, which is in good agreement with experimental results. This work demonstrates that MLFFs can be a promising application for predicting the phonon dispersion of both crystalline and defective structures."

DNA methylation, influenced by both genetic predispositions and environmental exposures, plays a significant role in sarcopenia occurrence. This study employed machine learning (ML) methods to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) capable of diagnosing sarcopenia in middle-aged individuals.We also investigated the relationship between muscle strength, muscle mass, age, and sarcopenia risk as reflected in methylation profiles.Methods: Data from 509 male participants in the urban cohort of the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study_Health Examinee study were categorized into quartile groups based on the sarcopenia criteria for appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI) and handgrip strength (HG). To identify diagnostic biomarkers for sarcopenia, we used recursive feature elimination with cross validation (RFECV), to pinpoint DMPs significantly associated with sarcopenia.An ensemble model, leveraging majority voting, was utilized for evaluation. Furthermore, a methylation risk score (MRS) was calculated, and its correlation with muscle strength, function, and age was assessed using likelihood ratio analysis and multinomial logistic regression.Results: Participants were classified into two groups based on quartile thresholds: sarcopenia (n = 37) with ASMI and HG in the lowest quartile, and normal ranges (n = 48) in the highest. In total, 238 DMPs were identified and eight probes were selected using RFECV.These DMPs were used to build an ensemble model with robust diagnostic capabilities for sarcopenia, as evidenced by an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94. Based on eight probes, the MRS was calculated and then validated by analyzing age, HG, and ASMI among the control group (n = 424). Age was positively correlated with high MRS (coefficient, 1.2494; odds ratio [OR], 3.4882), whereas ASMI and HG were negatively correlated with high MRS (ASMI coefficient, −0.4275; OR, 0.6521; HG coefficient, −0.3116; OR, 0.7323).Conclusion: Overall, this study identified key epigenetic markers of sarcopenia in Korean males and developed a ML model with high diagnostic accuracy for sarcopenia. The MRS also revealed significant correlations between these markers and age, HG, and ASMI. These findings suggest that both diagnostic models and the MRS can play an important role in managing sarcopenia in middle-aged populations."

Furthermore, reducing the threshold results in more signifi cant decreases in PM levels, achieved by allocating additional power to blowers and air conditioners."
Comparative analysis of machine learning-based dose assessment algorithms for TL dosimetry,2024,"['Dose assessment algorithm', 'ANN', 'LightGBM', 'TLD', 'Machine Learning', 'Dosimetry']",,"This paper explores the implementation of machine learning-based algorithms for TL dose assessment. It focuses on the radiation field classification, performance quotient evaluation, and shallow and deep dose equivalent assessment of ANN and LGBM, in comparison to the traditional method of DT. We evaluate these algorithms based on the element response data measured by TLD. A data set was built for training, and the base element responses of test categories were amplified, and normalized to 1 mSv Cs-137 within the range of ±3 %. Both algorithms consist of five subset models for classifying radiation fields and identifying ratios of mixed fields. The LGBM showed the best accuracy in classifying considered radiation fields and the lowest performance quotients.By comparing the tolerance levels of deep dose and shallow dose equivalents among the three algorithms, the LGBM yields the smallest difference between the predicted and true dose equivalents. This smaller difference implies the LGBM offers the least bias and standard deviation in the expected value, giving higher accuracy and precision in dose assessment over the traditional DT method.

Finding the optimal LP is a critical decision that impacts both the reload safety and the economic feasibility of the nuclear fuel cycle. While simulated annealing (SA) is a widely accepted technique to solve the LP optimization problem, it suffers from the drawback of high computational cost since LP optimization requires three-dimensional depletion calculations.

Comparative evaluation of machine learning techniques in predicting fundamental meteorological factors based on survey data from 1981 to 2021,2024,['Climate change · Climate prediction · Prediction techniques · Machine learning'],,"Predicting the meteorological factors of the climate in the medium and long term is a significant challenge with socio-economic and environmental implications, given its complex and chaotic nature. The current short-term weather predictions the Iraqi meteorological organization offers are less valuable. As a result, this study introduces four machine-learning methods—artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forest (RF), and K nearest neighbors—to forecast six meteorological factors: total precipitation (TPRE), minimum temperature (MINT), maximum temperature (MAXT), relative humidity (RHUM), top-of-atmosphere radiation (TOAR), and wind speed (WIND) up to 1, 3, 6, and 12 months ahead in four Iraqi governorates.Data on these factors from 1981 to 2021 were extracted from the Modern-ERA Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 dataset. The findings indicate that the RF algorithm outperformed other algorithms regarding prediction accuracy, while the SVR algorithm exhibited the least accuracy. Moreover, TPRE had the lowest performance with an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 19.002; conversely, RHUM and WIND showed much better performance with average RMSE values of 7.259 and 0.192 respectively. The highest performance was observed for MINT (MAXT and TOAR prediction with average-RMSE values of 2.346, 2.244, and 5.314, respectively). The present study’s findings will bring significant advantages in safeguarding human lives and property and promoting health, security, and economic prosperity."
Risk Factor Analysis of Cryopreserved Autologous Bone Flap Resorption in Adult Patients Undergoing Cranioplasty with Volumetry Measurement Using Conventional Statistics and Machine-Learning Technique,2024,['Bone flap resorption · Cranioplasty · Random forest · Machine learning'],,"Objective : Decompressive craniectomy (DC) with duroplasty is one of the common surgical treatments for life-threatening increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Once ICP is controlled, cranioplasty (CP) with reinsertion of the cryopreserved autologous bone flap or a synthetic implant is considered for protection and esthetics. Although with the risk of autologous bone flap resorption (BFR), cryopreserved autologous bone flap for CP is one of the important material due to its cost effectiveness. In this article, we performed conventional statistical analysis and the machine learning technique understand the risk factors for BFR.Methods : Patients aged >18 years who underwent autologous bone CP between January 2015 and December 2021 were reviewed. Demographic data, medical records, and volumetric measurements of the autologous bone flap volume from 94 patients were collected. BFR was defined with absolute quantitative method (BFR-A) and relative quantitative method (BFR%). Conventional statistical analysis and random forest with hyper-ensemble approach (RF with HEA) was performed. And overlapped partial dependence plots (PDP) were generated.Results : Conventional statistical analysis showed that only the initial autologous bone flap volume was statistically significant on BFR-A. RF with HEA showed that the initial autologous bone flap volume, interval between DC and CP, and bone quality were the factors with most contribution to BFR-A, while, trauma, bone quality, and initial autologous bone flap volume were the factors with most contribution to BFR%. Overlapped PDPs of the initial autologous bone flap volume on the BRF-A crossed at approximately 60 mL, and a relatively clear separation was found between the non-BFR and BFR groups. Therefore, the initial autologous bone flap of over 60 mL could be a possible risk factor for BFR.Conclusion : From the present study, BFR in patients who underwent CP with autologous bone flap might be inevitable. However, the degree of BFR may differ from one to another. Therefore, considering artificial bone flaps as implants for patients with large DC could be reasonable. Still, the risk factors for BFR are not clearly understood. Therefore, chronological analysis and pathophysiologic studies are needed."

Classification of Similarly Colored Medicinal Berries using Hyperspectral Images and Machine Learning Models,2024,"['classification model', 'evaluation metrics', 'logistic regression', 'medicinal plant', 'red fruits']",,"As the misuse of medicinal plants increases due to misclassifications brought about by similarities in the external characteristics (color, size, shape) of plants and their fruits, accurate identification techniques must be developed. Spectral information can be used to identify various characteristics of medicinal plants in wavelength ranges that cannot be seen by the naked eye. This study develops a non-destructive identification and classification technology for medicinal plants using hyperspectral imaging combined with machine learning models to eliminate the misidentification of medicinal berries that are very similar in size, shape, and color. Four models were used to classify different plant species: the logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) models. The optimal classification model was selected based on classification performance indicators. The dried fruit of four medicinal plant species were used: Cornus officinalis, Lycium chinense, Lycium barbarum, and Schisandra chinensis. Hyperspectral images of the samples were obtained corresponding to 150 wavelength bands in the 400–1000 nm range. For the training dataset, the average reflectance spectrum per berry was extracted. The accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the performance of each classification model. The LR model performed best, with accuracy of 0.99 and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 1 for all samples. The LR model produces very accurate results, and the classification system based on it is fast and non-destructive. The machine-learning-based hyperspectral imaging classification system can be applied and scaled up to the industrial level, effectively eliminating the misuse of medicinal plants through accurate identification of these plants."

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was used to accurately distinguish apples from leaves, with apple pixels classified as red and leaf pixels as green. The performance of the SVM model was evaluated using various metrics. Key evaluation metrics included IoU (Intersection over Union), Precision, Recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision). The results showed an IoU of 0.48, a Precision of 0.51, a Recall of 0.90, and an mAP of 0.48.

Estimating the causal impact of non-traditional household structures on children’s educational performance using a machine learning propensity score,2024,"['Family structure', 'Immigrant family', 'Academic performance']",,"Over the past two decades, family structures have diversified. International migration has led to a rise in the number of families in which at least one parent is foreign-born. Increases have also been observed in both the rate of partnership separation, leading to a greater number of single-parent households and an increase in the number of families where grandparents have assumed caring responsibilities for their grandchildren. Evidence indicates a strong relationship between family structure and children’s educational outcomes. Parental involvement is well documented as a key ingredient for the educational success of children. Drawing on Taiwanese multi-wave survey data (Taiwan Assessment of Student Achievement) and a machine-learning-based propensity score algorithm for multiple treatments, this paper aims to determine the various relationships between children from different household structures (two-parent households, skipped generation households, single-parent households, and immigrant households) and their cognitive knowledge (measured by test scores). Key findings reveal that children from skipped generation households achieve the lowest performance scores and that those from immigrant households tend to perform even better than children from traditional two-parent households in certain disciplines. Our results suggest that policy interventions targeted at providing remedial education and/or financial assistance are needed to support children from skipped generation families to redress existing educational disadvantages in Taiwan."

There are, however, still differing opinions on the effect of syngas addition on the knocking phenomenon under boosted conditions: Some suggest that syngas reduces knock by inhibiting end-gas auto-ignition, while others claim that syngas increases knock due to the high pressure rise rate caused by the excessive flame speed of hydrogen. Therefore, this study examines the syngas addition effect on knock intensity and unveils the black box relation between combustion processes and knock intensity with syngas using machine learning based surrogate models. A boosted single-cylinder research engine equipped with a syngas injector and a gasoline port injector was utilized to gather the data over a range of boost levels and spark timing, and seven machine learning based surrogate models were trained on the combustion data. The selected regression model predicted knock intensity given an input space comprising engine control factors and calculated combustion phase data. The regression models were auto-tuned to find the best predicting model over 20,000 samples. The results show the trained model can explain knocking intensity over 70%. Syngas addition extends the knock limit in all boost conditions, and the effect is stronger as increasing the intake pressure. In addition, the model showed the initial flame kernel development phase has the strongest relation with knock intensity compared to other combustion phases."

The intervals were categorized as “<6 months,” “6 months to 3 years,” “3 years to 5 years,” and “>5 years.” The regression model aimed to predict survival time (in months). We used attribute weights to gain insights into the model, highlighting features with a significant impact on predictions and offering valuable insights into the model’s behavior and decision-making process. Results: The gradient boosting trees algorithm achieved an 81.55% accuracy in the classification model, while the random forest algorithm excelled in the regression model, with a root mean square error of 22.432. Notably, radiation doses around the affected areas significantly influenced survival duration. Conclusions: Machine learning demonstrated the ability to provide high-accuracy predictions of survival periods in both classification and regression problems.

Comparison and Identification of Optimal Machine Learning Model for Rapid Optimization of Printed Line Characteristics of Aerosol Jet Printing Technology,2024,"['Machine learning', 'Multi-objective optimization', 'Electrical conductivity', 'Printed line quality', 'Aerosol jet 3d printing']",,"Among the various direct-write (DW) techniques, aerosol jet printing (AJP) has the advantages of high resolution (~ 10 μm) and flexible working distance (2-5 mm). On this basis, it has emerged as a promising DW technology to precisely customize complex electrical functional devices. However, the micro-electronic devices fabricated using AJP suffer from low electrical performance because of inferior printed line geometric characteristics. Specifically, high edge roughness lines are detrimental to the uniformity of the formed electrical functional devices. In addition, the low controllability of the printed line width may induce overlap of narrowly spaced circuits or unnecessary intertrack voids, which will hinder the wide application of AJP technology in advanced electronic manufacturing industry. Therefore, ensuring high precision of the line width and low edge roughness is of primary importance for AJP technology. In this research, a machine learning framework is proposed for rapid optimization of printed line characteristics. In the proposed framework, SHGFR and CGFR were considered as input variables, and line width and line roughness were taken as the target responses. Three representative machine learning algorithms, tree-based random forest regression, kernel-based support vector machine, and Bayesian-based Gaussian process regression, were then adopted for model development. Subsequently, the identified optimal machine learning model was integrated with a NSGA-III for rapid optimization of printed line characteristics, and experiments validated the effectiveness of the adopted approach."
Machine Learning Model for Reduction Deformation of Plastic Motor Housing for Automobiles,2024,"['Injection molding', 'Machine learning', 'Optimization', 'Plastic motor housing']",,"The purpose of this paper is to introduce a fusion method that combines the design of experiments (DOE) and machine learning to optimize the bias of plastic products. The study focuses on the plastic motor housing used in automobiles, which is manufactured through plastic injection molding. Achieving optimal molding for the motor housing involves the optimization of various molding conditions, including injection pressure, injection time, holding pressure, mold temperature, and cooling time. Failure to optimize these conditions can lead to increased product deformation. To minimize the deformation of the motor housing, the widely used Taguchi method, which is one of the design of experiment techniques, was employed to identify the injection molding conditions that affect deformation. Machine learning was then applied to various models based on the identified molding conditions. Among the models, the Random Forest model emerged as the most effective in predicting deformation amounts. The validity of the Random Forest model was also confirmed through verification. The verification results demonstrated the excellent prediction accuracy of the trained Random Forest model. By utilizing the validated model, molding conditions that minimize deformation were determined. Implementation of these optimal molding conditions led to a reduction of approximately 5.3% in deformation compared to the conditions before optimization. It is noteworthy that all injection molding outcomes presented in this paper were obtained through robust injection molding simulations, ensuring both research objectivity and speed."
Molecular structural descriptor‐assisted machine learning for organic photovoltaics with perylenediimide acceptors,2024,"['machine learning', 'molecular structural descriptor', 'organic photovoltaic', 'perylenediimide', 'quantitative structure–property relationship']",,"Although organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have evolved over the last two decades, the discovery of new materials and optimization of numerous considerations for high-performance devices remain challenging. To reduce these laborious processes and expedite the advancement of OPVs, we constructed machine learning (ML) models that predict photovoltaic parameters. We designed a unique descriptor that divides the molecular structure into smaller units and translates them into a concise matrix. This allows the ML model to easily track structural units and understand which units are important for predicting target performance, enabling the ML model to prioritize crucial units. Therefore, without requiring additional data from measurements or calculations, the ML models can extract chemical properties from molecular structural information and accurately predict the photovoltaic parameters. The ML models that predict the photovoltaic parameters, including the open-circuit voltage, shortcircuit current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency, all show remarkably superior prediction performance, with Pearson correlation coefficients exceeding 0.68. Consequently, in this article, we propose a highly precise and reliable predictive OPV-ML platform that can robustly screen for unnecessary experiments and accelerate OPV development."

This study used graph machine learning to identify hidden networks and predict mental health conditions in the middle-aged and old.Methods Data came from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2016–2018), with 2,000 participants aged 56 or more. The dependent variable was mental disease (no vs. yes) in 2018. Twenty-eight predictors in 2016 were included. Graph machine learning with systematic hyper-parameter selection was conducted.Results The area under the curve was similar across different models in different scenarios. However, sensitivity (93%) was highest for the graph random forest in the scenario of 2,000 participants and the centrality requirement of life satisfaction 90. Based on the graph random forest, top-10 determinants of mental disease were mental disease in previous period (2016), age, income, life satisfaction–health, life satisfaction–overall, subjective health, body mass index, life satisfaction–economic, children alive and health insurance. Especially, life satisfaction–overall was a top-5 determinant in the graph random forest, which considers life satisfaction as an emotional connection and a group interaction.Conclusion Improving an individual’s life satisfaction as a personal condition is expected to strengthen the individual’s emotional connection as a group interaction, which would reduce the risk of the individual’s mental disease in the end. This would bring an important clinical implication for highlighting the importance of a patient’s life satisfaction and emotional connection regarding the diagnosis and management of the patient’s mental disease."
A Research on Machine Learning Agent in Rogue-like game,2024,"['Unity', 'Machine Learning', 'Unity ML Agent', 'Rogue-like']",,"Collecting large amounts of data in the real world is expensive and has clear limitations.Simulation-generated environments, on the other hand, offer the opportunity to efficiently generate the necessary data and to try different things easily and quickly. In this research, we utilized one of the tools that addresses these challenges, by the Unity Machine Learning tool, to study an efficient automation model that responds to the characteristics of the rogue-like genre.For testing purposes, we implemented a simple game, implanted an agent into the main character of the game, and fed the agent with code to shoot and avoid hostile. The implemented ML Agent successfully recognized the hostile targets and responded by shooting and dodging them. However, instead of learning to prioritize the hostile targets over time by reinforcing itself and shooting the high-risk targets first, it consistently fired in only one of the 360-degree directions given to it at the beginning, which we didn’t expected, so we improved the code. By utilizing the RayPerceptionSensor-Component2D element to directly feed the agent's sensors with information about hostile targets, we found that the agent was able to utilize its ray sensor to detect them and make much more precise aimed shots. In fact, it outperformed the original model by an average of 3.81x, proving that Unity ML Agentcan collect data through reinforcement learning in the roguelike genre."

The study aims to conduct experimental programs to analyze the implications of utilizing various quantities of stone dust and fly ash as a substitute for sand and cement on foam concrete's fresh, hardened, and non-destructive testing (NDT) properties. The study explores foam concrete's compressive, splitting, permeability, pulse velocity, and microstructural properties and its potential as an alternative to conventional concrete in saline environments while integrating machine learning techniques like SVM and ANN for predicting compressive strength. The experimental study utilized three foam concrete batches with varying filler and binder proportions: Batch I with 100% sand and different fly ash percentages, Batch II with stone dust replacing sand and cement replaced by fly ash, and Batch III with 100% stone dust and different fly ash and cement ratios, all consistently using a foaming agent at 0.5% by binder weight. The study observed that replacing approximately 30% of cement with fly ash yielded the highest compressive strength, while substituting over 40% of sand with stone dust also showed promising results, achieving peak compressive strengths of 13-14 MPa. The study findings further revealed that the water absorption and permeability rate were minimal, and the rebound hammer, microstructure, and pulse velocity were ultimate when cement was replaced with roughly 30% fly ash. The experiments' outcomes are utilized to develop advanced machine learning methods for forecasting its strength. The ML technique demonstrates that an inferior regression coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) support vector machine (SVM) contrasts dramatically with a larger R<sup>2</sup> value for the artificial neural networks (ANN), showing an excellent projection with experimental data."

Granger causality in machine learning model: Application to KOSPI and Asian stock market indices,2024,"['그레인저 인과', '기계학습', '인공신경망', '벡터자기회귀모형', 'Granger causality', 'machine learning', 'neural network', 'vector autoregression']","본 논문에서는 기계학습을 이용한 예측모형에 그레인저 인과 검정을 도입하고자 한다. 현재 기계학습을 이용한 예측은 여러 분야에서 다양하게 사용되고 있지만 통계적인 가설검정 방법은 아직 확립되어 있지 않은 상황이다. 이러한 이유로 본 연구에서는 예측 오차들의 차이를 통하여 인과 검정을 시도한다. 추정 계수의 속성이 밝혀져 있지 않은 관계로 비모수 방법의 하나인 윌콕슨 부호순위 검정을 이용한다. 제시된 검정방법을 KOSPI와 아시아 주요 주식시장간의 인과관계 분석에 적용하였다. 시계열분석방법과 기계학습 방법을 이용하여 인과관계를 검정한 결과를 비교하여 다음의 두 가지 결론을 도출하였다. 첫째, 기계학습을 이용하는 경우 시계열 분석 방법보다 더 많은 인과관계를 찾아낼 수 있다. 둘째, 기계학습 모형에서는 인과관계가 존재하는 경우 그 관계의 정도가 매우 강하다는 것을 알 수 있다. 이러한 두 가지의 발견은 기계학습 모형이 설명변수와 피설명변수간의 모든 가능한 형태의 인과관계를 고려하여 예측하기 때문으로 볼 수 있다.","Granger causality test is introduced into machine learning model. Following Granger (1969), prediction errors are compared for the test. Since no formal statistical test is established in machine learning, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test is used to derive statistical significance. Causality relationships between KOSPI and major Asian stock market indices are analyzed. From the comparisons of vector autoregression (VAR) and neural network models, two major findings are derived. First, neural network model identifies more causality relationships. Second, the Granger causalities between KOSPI and one of the Asian stock indices are more transparent in neural network model than in time series model. These results may be due to the fact that neural network model incorporates almost all possible shapes of functional relationships between target and feature variables. The neural network model finds more predictability because it extracts all available predictive sources from feature variables."
Identifying Cluster Patterns in Relationship Between Municipal Revenue Configuration and Fiscal Surplus: Application of Machine Learning Methodologies,2024,"['Government Fiscal Surplus', 'Machine Learning Methodologies', 'Revenue Configuration', 'Cluster by Financial Sources']",,"Net surplus serves as a crucial indicator of how efficiently local governments utilize their resources. This study aims to analyze and categorize the patterns of net surplus across 75 local governments in Korea. By employing machine learning techniques such as K-means clustering and silhouette analysis, this research delves into surplus patterns, revealing insights that differ from those provided by traditional analytical methods. Machine learning enables a broader spectrum of discoveries, leading us to identify three distinct clusters in the net surplus of Korean local finances. The characteristics of these three clusters show that the wealthiest cities have the highest surplus ratios. In contrast, mid-sized municipalities, constrained by limited central government support and scarce local resources, exhibit the lowest surplus ratios. Interestingly, a significant number of cities maintain a median surplus ratio even under challenging fiscal conditions. Additionally, we identify critical thresholds that differentiate the three clusters: a grant-in-aid ratio of 19.31%, a debt ratio of 3.52%, and a local tax ratio of 25.58%. This identification of thresholds is a key contribution of our study, as these specific thresholds have not been previously addressed in the literature."

"p27 Cell Cycle Inhibitor and Survival in Luminal-Type Breast Cancer: Gene Ontology, Machine Learning, and Drug Screening Analysis",2024,"['Breast Neoplasms', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Gene Ontology', 'Machine Learning', 'Prognosis']",,"Purpose A widely distributed cell cycle inhibitor, p27, regulates cyclin-dependent kinase-cyclin complexes. Although the prognostic value of p27 has been established for various types of carcinomas, its role in luminal breast cancer remains poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the functional enrichment of p27 and identify potential drug targets in patients with luminal-type breast cancer.Methods Clinicopathological data were collected from 868 patients with luminal-type breast cancer. Additionally, publicly available data from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset (1,500 patients) and the Gene Expression Omnibus database (855 patients) were included in the analysis. Immunohistochemical staining for p27, differential gene expression analysis, disease ontology analysis, survival prediction modeling using machine learning (ML), and in vitro drug screening were also performed.Results Low p27 expression correlated with younger age, advanced tumor stage, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor negativity, decreased cluster of differentiation 8+ T cell count, and poorer survival outcomes in luminal-type breast cancer. The METABRIC data revealed that reduced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) expression (encoding p27) was associated with cell proliferation-related pathways and epigenetic polycomb repressive complex 2. Using ML, p27 emerged as the second most significant survival factor after N stage, thereby enhancing survival model performance. Additionally, luminal-type breast cancer cell lines with low CDKN1B expression demonstrated increased sensitivity to specific anticancer drugs such as voxtalisib and serdemetan, implying a potential therapeutic synergy between CDKN1B-targeted approaches and these drugs.Conclusion The integration of ML and bioinformatic analyses of p27 has the potential to enhance risk stratification and facilitate personalized treatment strategies for patients with breast cancer."

Image reconstruction method of gamma emission tomography based on prior-aware information and machine learning for partial-defect detection of PWR-type spent nuclear fuel,2024,"['Safeguards', 'Spent nuclear fuel', 'Partial defect', 'Gamma emission tomography', 'Monte Carlo simulation', 'Machine learning algorithm']",,"Spent nuclear fuel (SNF) requires accurate and effective supervision to prevent radiation release to the public and the environment. Gamma emission tomography (GET) has been used to inspect partial-defects at the pin-by-pin level through the acquisition of tomographic images. However, due to the high density of nuclear fuel rods, GET shows relatively low accuracy for the central region. This study proposes an image reconstruction method for the internal fuels based on Monte Carlo simulation and machine learning algorithm. The gammas from the SNF were measured with the GET device and the sinograms were reconstructed with Maximum-Likelihood Expectation- Maximization (MLEM) with prior-aware information of SNF, and image quality was improved with the machine learning technique. Our results show that the MLEM with prior-aware information could dramatically improve the image quality and the denoising technique with the machine learning could clearly correct the over-and under-estimation. Based on the results of quantitative validation of the proposed reconstruction method, the pattern classification accuracy was calculated to be about 100 %. These techniques enabled the image acquisition of the central fuel rod and increased accuracy in partial defect detection. For further study, the performance of the proposed reconstruction method will be evaluated based on the experiment data."

Modelling Uncertainties and Sensitivity Analysis of Landslide Susceptibility Prediction under Different Environmental Factor Connection Methods and Machine Learning Models,2024,"['Landslide susceptibility prediction', 'Uncertainty issue', 'Sensitivity analysis', 'Connection method', 'Machine learning']",,"The utilization of different connection methods between landslides and environmental factors introduces uncertainty in landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP). Investigating and identifying the characteristics of this uncertainty and determining more suitable connection methods are of significant importance for LSP. This study uses original 12 environmental factors data as well as calculated data from five connection methods, namely, probability statistics (PS), frequency ratio (FR), information volume (IV), index of entropy (IOE), and weight of evidence (WOE), as model input variables. Then, four machine learnings logistic regression (LR), Bayesian networks (BN), support vector machines (SVM) and C5.0 Decision Trees (C5.0 DT) are combined with the calculated data and the original data to create 24 unique combinations of connection methods and models. Under these 24 combinations, the uncertainty analysis of LSP modeling is conducted, using Huichang County of China as an example. The analysis entails accuracy assessment, statistical analysis of landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs), distribution patterns of LSIs and sensitivity analysis of the two uncertainty issues. The results show that: 1) LSP accuracies of the FR-, IV- and IOE-based models are comparable, but are lower than those of the WOE-based models, with those of the PS-based models being the worst. WOE has better nonlinear connection performance than the other methods. 2) LSP accuracies of individual models are slightly lower than those of coupled models, but their modeling efficiencies are higher than those of coupled models. 3) The machine learning is more sensitive than the connection method for LSP. In short, WOE-C5.0 DT has the lowest LSP uncertainty while a single machine learning can produce satisfied LSP results with high modelling efficiency."

JAK2 Loss Arising From Tumor-Spread-Through-Air-Spaces (STAS) Promotes Tumor Progression by Suppressing CD8+ T Cells in Lung Adenocarcinoma: A Machine Learning Approach,2024,"['JAK2', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Tumor Spread Through Air Spaces (STAS)', 'CD8+ T Cells', 'Machine Learning']",,"Background: Tumor spread through air spaces (STAS) is a recently discovered risk factor for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The aim of this study was to investigate specific genetic alterations and anticancer immune responses related to STAS. By using a machine learning algorithm and drug screening in lung cancer cell lines, we analyzed the effect of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) on the survival of patients with LUAD and possible drug candidates.Methods: This study included 566 patients with LUAD corresponding to clinicopathological and genetic data. For analyses of LUAD, we applied gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), in silico cytometry, pathway network analysis, in vitro drug screening, and gradient boosting machine (GBM) analysis.Results: The patients with STAS had a shorter survival time than those without STAS (P < 0.001). We detected gene set-related downregulation of JAK2 associated with STAS using GSEA. Low JAK2 expression was related to poor prognosis and a low CD8+ T-cell fraction. In GBM, JAK2 showed improved survival prediction performance when it was added to other parameters (T stage, N stage, lymphovascular invasion, pleural invasion, tumor size). In drug screening, mirin, CCT007093, dihydroretenone, and ABT737 suppressed the growth of lung cancer cell lines with low JAK2 expression.Conclusion: In LUAD, low JAK2 expression linked to the presence of STAS might serve as an unfavorable prognostic factor. A relationship between JAK2 and CD8+ T cells suggests that STAS is indirectly related to the anticancer immune response. These results may contribute to the design of future experimental research and drug development programs for LUAD with STAS."

This study seeks to enhance the suitability of clothing design by applying the new analytical methodology of machine learning techniques to better capture and classify the unique body shapes of Korean women.In this study, machine learning techniques such as K-means clustering, Silhouette analysis, and Decision Tree analysis were used to classify the lower body shapes of Korean women in their twenties and identify standard body shapes useful for slacks design. The results showed that the lower body of the age group could be classified into three categories: 'small stature' (the majority), 'tall with an average lower body volume,' and 'medium height with a fuller lower body' (the smallest share). The three-cluster approach is validated through Silhouette analysis, which minimizes misclassification.Decision Tree analysis then further defines the criteria for these clusters, highlighting waist height and hip depth as the most significant factors, achieving a classification accuracy of 90.6%. While this study is not directly related to Robotic Process Automation, its detailed analysis of body shapes for slacks patterns can aid RPA in clothing production.

Machine Learning Algorithm Comparison for the Performance Evaluation of Manual Welding Process,2024,"['Manual welding', 'Welding training', 'Performance evaluation', 'Shipbuilding assembly process', 'Machine learning']",,"With the development of technology, the shipbuilding industry has seen a rise in automated welding processes. However, manual welding continues to be a necessary and in-demand skill. Unfortunately, the supply of both high-skilled and unskilled welders has steadily declined over the past decade, leading to a shortage of professional manpower. To address the issue of manpower shortage, a proposal has been made to provide timely and efficient training program for unskilled welders. However, evaluating the effectiveness of the training has proven challenging due to the lack of clear criteria for assessing the performance. This paper conducts an effective performance evaluation of unskilled welders using powerful machine learning algorithms. The evaluation is based on a dataset collected from both high-skilled and unskilled welder groups in manual welding processes. A comparison study is conducted to determine the most suitable algorithm. The goal is to identify the positive and negative parameters in the training of the manual welding process and provide an effective education strategy for unskilled welders. Additionally, the paper aims to find the algorithm with the highest accuracy. Overall, this study seeks to provide a solution to the shortage of manual welding professionals through the development of an efficient education strategy."
"Machine Learning Complex Interactions Among Recovery, Precipitation, and Recrystallization for Nb Micro-Alloyed Steels",2024,['Machine learning · Static softening · Static recrystallization · Micro-alloyed steels'],,"Static softening behaviors that mainly includes recovery and recrystallization play the important role in controlling themicrostructure and mechanical properties of micro-alloyed steels during hot rolling, which is the essence for optimizing thecontrolled rolling processes. Chemical compositions and deformation conditions are the key factors to the static softeningbehaviors, but their quantitative influences are not clear due to the complex interactions among softening, precipitation, andhot deformation. In the present work, an integrated machine learning (ML) system for the static softening behaviors underdifferent chemical compositions and deformation conditions is established, based on ML modeling of strain-induced precipitationand the data collected from the published literatures. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was usedto determine the recovery and recrystallization model parameters for different niobium (Nb) micro-alloyed steels. Supportvector machine (SVM) was used to establish the relationships between these parameters and compositions and processingparameters. By using the integrated ML system, the effects of compositions and deformation conditions on the static softeningcritical temperature (SSCT), static softening behavior were predicted. The predictions were compared with the measuredvalues, indicating that the ML system can accurately predict static softening behaviors for different steel grades under differentprocessing conditions, which lays a foundation for the accurate design of controlled rolling processes."

In this study, various machine learning (ML)-based models using facial expressions, the analgesia nociception index (ANI), and vital signs were developed to predict postoperative pain intensity, and their performances for predicting severe postoperative pain were compared.Methods: In total, 155 facial expressions from patients who underwent gastrectomy were recorded postoperatively; one blinded anesthesiologist simultaneously recorded the ANI score, vital signs, and patient self-assessed pain intensity based on the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). The ML models’ area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) were calculated and compared using DeLong’s test.Results: ML models were constructed using facial expressions, ANI, vital signs, and different combinations of the three datasets.

The researchers aimed to identify the main parameters that affect the compressive strength of these confined columns. They used models to analyze and study the relationship between these parameters and the compressive strength. The study found that certain parameters had an inverse relationship with compressive strength. These parameters include the column diameter, CFRP fracture strain, and modulus of elasticity. On the other hand, the CFRP thickness and concrete strength exhibited a positive relationship with the compressive strength. The study also determined that the influence of column diameter and CFRP thickness was greater compared to the influence of CFRP fracture strain and elastic modulus on the compressive strength. To predict the compressive strength, the researchers developed a machine learning algorithm-based compressive strength prediction model. They found that a backpropagation (BP) neural network model showed high prediction accuracy and robustness in predicting the strength. Additionally, the researchers' model was analyzed, and it was found that while the calculated values from their model aligned well with the experimental results, there were some issues with overestimating or conservatively estimating the compressive strength in certain cases."

Digital Forensic Investigation on Social Media Platforms: A Survey on Emerging Machine Learning Approaches,2024,"['machine learning', 'digital forensics', 'natural language processing', 'social media forensics']",,"An online social network is a platform that is continuously expanding, which enables groups of people to share their views and communicate with one another using the Internet. The social relations among members of the public are significantly improved because of this gesture. Despite these advantages and opportunities, criminals are continuing to broaden their attempts to exploit people by making use of techniques and approaches designed to undermine and exploit their victims for criminal activities. The field of digital forensics, on the other hand, has made significant progress in reducing the impact of this risk. Even though most of these digital forensic investigation techniques are carried out manually, most of these methods are not usually appropriate for use with online social networks due to their complexity, growth in data volumes, and technical issues that are present in these environments. In both civil and criminal cases, including sexual harassment, intellectual property theft, cyberstalking, online terrorism, and cyberbullying, forensic investigations on social media platforms have become more crucial. This study explores the use of machine learning techniques for addressing criminal incidents on social media platforms, particularly during forensic investigations. In addition, it outlines some of the difficulties encountered by forensic investigators while investigating crimes on social networking sites."
Machine learning Anti-inflammatory Peptides Role in Recent Drug Discovery,2024,"['Anti-inflammatory', 'Peptides', 'Machine learning.']",,"Several anti-inflammatory small molecules have been found in the process of the inflammatory response, and these small molecules have been used to treat some inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Numerous tools for predicting anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs) have emerged in recent years. However, conducting experimental validations in the lab is both resource-intensive and time-consuming. Current therapies for inflammatory and autoimmune disorders often involve nonspecific anti-inflammatory drugs and immunosuppressants, often with potential side effects.

Applying a twodimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to a dataset of 12,143 avian influenza virus genomes from 64 countries, encompassing 119 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) types, we achieved significant classification accuracy. The pathogenicity was determined based on the presence of H5 or H7 subtypes, and our models, ranging from zero to six mid-layers, indicated that a four-layer model most effectively identified highly pathogenic strains, with accuracies over 0.9.To enhance our approach, we incorporated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and one-class SVM for abnormality detection, improving model robustness through bootstrapping. Furthermore, the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) algorithm was fine-tuned via hyperparameter optimization to corroborate the findings. The PCA identified distinct clustering for pathogenic HA, yielding an AUC of up to 0.85. The optimized K-NN model demonstrated an impressive accuracy between 0.96 and 0.97.

The proposed HLM is evaluated for root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA’s) randomized battery usage data set (RBUDS).The results indicate that the recommended HLM is more accurate and has a smaller error margin than existing ML models."
Using Machine Learning Models to  Identify Factors Associated With  30-Day Readmissions After Posterior  Cervical Fusions: A Longitudinal  Cohort Study,2024,"['Machine learning', 'Predictive modeling', 'Readmission', 'Spine', 'Costs', 'Posterior cervical fusion']",,"Objective: Readmission rates after posterior cervical fusion (PCF) significantly impact patients and healthcare, with complication rates at 15%–25% and up to 12% 90-day readmission rates. In this study, we aim to test whether machine learning (ML) models that capture interfactorial interactions outperform traditional logistic regression (LR) in identifying readmission-associated factors.Methods: The Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database was used to identify patients who underwent PCF between 2004–2017. To determine factors associated with 30-day readmissions, 5 ML models were generated and evaluated, including a multivariate LR (MLR) model. Then, the best-performing model, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), was compared to the LACE (Length patient stay in the hospital, Acuity of admission of patient in the hospital, Comorbidity, and Emergency visit) index regarding potential cost savings from algorithm implementation.Results: This study included 4,130 patients, 874 of which were readmitted within 30 days.When analyzed and scaled, we found that patient discharge status, comorbidities, and number of procedure codes were factors that influenced MLR, while patient discharge status, billed admission charge, and length of stay influenced the GBM model. The GBM model significantly outperformed MLR in predicting unplanned readmissions (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.846 vs. 0.829; p < 0.001), while also projecting an average cost savings of 50% more than the LACE index.Conclusion: Five models (GBM, XGBoost [extreme gradient boosting], RF [random forest], LASSO [least absolute shrinkage and selection operator], and MLR) were evaluated, among which, the GBM model exhibited superior predictive performance, robustness, and accuracy. Factors associated with readmissions impact LR and GBM models differently, suggesting that these models can be used complementarily. When analyzing PCF procedures, the GBM model resulted in greater predictive performance and was associated with higher theoretical cost savings for readmissions associated with PCF complications."
Theorizing the Role of Machine Translation in L2 Reading Comprehension: Validating the Theory and Exploring the Learning Potential through MT Use,2024,"['machine translation', 'CI model', 'L2 reading', 'L1 reading', 'learning potential', 'translanguaging']",,"This study investigates the theoretical dimensions of how machine translation (MT) plays a role in relation to L1 reading competence in L2 reading comprehension. Leveraging Kintsch’s Construction-Integration (CI) model for L2 reading proposed by Oh (2014), our research posits that MT mediation enhances the textbase by alleviating constraints related to L2 proficiency. This, in turn, facilitates a more effective utilization of L1 reading resources, contributing to an enriched situation model. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted an empirical study with 89 college students enrolled in a general English course at a South Korean university. Participants engaged in reading activities under two conditions: a pre-MT (reading without MT) and a post-MT (reading with MT). The comprehensive model, incorporating a textbase indicated by L2 vocabulary, grammar, and sentence parsing, and a situation model represented by L1 reading competence, was examined through structural equation modelling across these conditions. Additionally, we analyzed learning potential scores (LPS)—reflecting the difference between the two conditions—using hierarchical multiple regression to identify significant predictors of enhanced comprehension with MT use. Our findings confirm the validity of the models, demonstrating the textbase as a key mechanism through which MT influences reading comprehension. The results also underscore the significance of L1 reading competence and L2 parsing ability as key predictors for LPS. These findings are discussed within the context of the changing multiliteracies landscape, contributing to the broader discourse on language education and technology integration."
Machine Learning for Movement Pattern Changes during Kinect-Based Mixed Reality Exercise Programs in Women with Possible Sarcopenia: Pilot Study,2024,"['Resistance training', 'Sarcopenia', 'Machine learning', 'Movement', 'Augmented reality']",,"Background: Sarcopenia is a muscle-wasting condition that affects older individuals. It can lead to changes in movement patterns, which can increase the risk of falls and other injuries. Methods: Older women participants aged ≥65 years who could walk independently were recruited and classified into two groups based on knee extension strength (KES). Participants with low KES scores were assigned to the possible sarcopenia group (PSG; n=7) and an 8-week exercise intervention was implemented. Healthy seniors with high KES scores were classified as the reference group (RG; n=4), and a 3-week exercise intervention was conducted. Kinematic movement data were recorded during the intervention period. All participants' exercise repetitions were used in the data analysis (number of data points=1,128). Results: The PSG showed significantly larger movement patterns in knee rotation during wide squats compared to the RG, attributed to weakened lower limb strength. The voting classifier, trained on the movement patterns from wide squats, determined that significant differences in overall movement patterns between the two groups persisted until the end of the exercise intervention. However, after the exercise intervention, significant improvements in lower limb strength in the PSG resulted in reduced knee rotation range of motion and max, thereby stabilizing movements and eliminating significant differences with the RG. Conclusion: This study suggests that exercise interventions can modify the movement patterns in older individuals with possible sarcopenia. These findings provide fundamental data for developing an exercise management system that remotely tracks and monitors the movement patterns of older adults during exercise activities."

Electroen-cephalography (EEG), a noninvasive method for recording brain activity, is valuable forstudying ADHD-related neural patterns. This study explored the potential of EEG data todifferentiate children with ADHD and Healthy Controls (HC) to enhance diagnostic accuracy.We analyzed EEG recordings from 61 children with ADHD and 60 healthy controls. TheEEG data comprised signals from 19 scalp channels. Our primary objective was to develop amachine learning model capable of classifying ADHD subjects with ADHD from HC usingEEG data as discriminatory features. To select the most relevant features, we utilized mutualinformation (MI), a measure of the statistical dependence between two variables. The topfeatures were selected based on their minimum MI values, ensuring that they captured mean-ingful information from both ADHD and HC groups. Principal component analysis (PCA)was employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving the essential features, aiming tomitigate computational complexity. The selected features were then used to train ten differentclassifiers: random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),extra tree classifier (ET), XGBoost (XGB), support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression(LR), adaboost, classification and regression trees (CART), and gradient boosting machines(GBM). A stacked classifier was constructed by combining the outputs of all ten individualclassifiers, with the MLP acting as a meta-classifier. The stacked classifier outperformedindividual models, achieving an impressive accuracy of 92%. Its precision (91%) and sen-sitivity (93%) were also higher than those of the individual models, indicating its ability tocorrectly identify ADHD-positive cases. Furthermore, the specificity of the stacked classifier(93%) was superior, highlighting its improved proficiency in correctly classifying HC. Thiscomprehensive evaluation established the stacked classifier as an effective approach for ADHDclassification, surpassing the performance of several standalone models.

Our method was evaluated on the CANERCorpus, a specialized dataset containing annotated texts from Classical Arabic literature. The Naive Bayes (NB) approach achieved an F-measure of 80%, with precision and recall levels at 86% and 75%, respectively. These results indicate a significant improvement over traditional methods, particularly in dealing with the intricate structure of Classical Arabic. The study highlights the potential of ML in overcoming the challenges of ANER and provides directions for further research in this domain."

Therefore, this study developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict PCa in Korean men and evaluated its usability.Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 928 patients who underwent prostate biopsies at Kangwon National University Hospital between May 2013 and May 2023. Of these, 377 (41.6%) were diagnosed with PCa, and 551 (59.4%) did not have cancer. For external validation, clinical data from 385 patients aged 48–89 years who underwent prostate biopsies from September 2005 to September 2023 at Wonju Severance Christian Hospital were also included. Twenty-two clinical features were used to develop an ML model to predict PCa. Features were selected based on their contributions to model performance, leading to the inclusion of 15 features. A meta-learner was constructed using logistic regression to predict the probability of PCa, and the classifier was trained and validated on randomly extracted training and test sets at an 8:2 ratio.Results: The prostate health index, prostate volume, age, nodule on digital rectal examination, and prostate-specific antigen were the top 5 features for predicting PCa. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the meta-learner logistic regression model was 0.89, and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.828, 0.711, and 0.909, respectively. Our model also showed excellent prediction performance for high-grade PCa, with a Gleason score of 7 or higher and an AUC of 0.903.Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of the model using external cohort clinical data and achieved an AUC of 0.863.Conclusions: Our ML model excelled in predicting PCa, specifically clinically significant PCa. Although extensive cross-validation in other clinical cohorts is needed, this ML model is a promising option for future diagnostics."

This research proposeda domain knowledge combined with ML method to increase interpretability while ensuring the accuracy of ML modelsand verifies the generality of the ML approach in fatigue crack growth (FCG) modelling. LZ50 steel single edge notchtension (SENT) specimens were tested for short crack (SC) growth rate and microstructure characterization under variousR-controls. Based on the test results, the SC growth process was divided into 3 stages: microstructural short crack (0–145 μm),physical short crack (145–1000 μm), and long crack (1000 μm–fracture). Following the analysis of 8 semi-empirical FSCGrate equations with different driving forces, 6 impact variables that may affect the FCG rate characteristics were identified.Random forest and Pearson correlation analysis were used to investigate the influence of each feature on the FCG rate and therelationships among the features. The main influential features for the short crack symbolic regression (SCSR) model werefound to be |ΔK–ΔKat|, Δγxy, |a–at|, and eα(1−R). After considering these 4 input features, the predicted FSCG rate equationgenerated by the SR model has a concise mathematical structure. Finally, an elastic net multiple linear regression methodwas proposed to determine the parameters of the predicted equation, while retaining the physical characteristics of eachparameter.

Discrimination of Feature Influence Model for Obesity Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques,2024,"['Obesity', 'Machine learning', 'Classification', 'Obesity features', 'SelectKBest', 'Feature Subset (FSS)']",,"It has been generally observed that a set of clinically established features can be used to predict obesity. Due to lifestyle habits, most of the population deviates from the suggested treatment to control the state of obesity. This study is an experimental analysis of the effect of related features on the classification of obesity. Two research questions have been designed: “With what degree of accuracy can obesity be categorized using a feature vector (FS) with 16 features?” (RQ1), and, “Can a feature subset (FSS) classify the disease with an accuracy of over 90% compared to the accuracy obtained in RQ1?” (RQ2). It was observed that an FS comprising 16 features reflected an accuracy of 96.68% in the classification of obesity in RQ1, and an FSS comprising four features (selected using the SelectKBest algorithm) exhibited an accuracy of 88.38% on the same dataset. Since 88.38% is 91.42% of 96.68%, the FSS attains accuracy over 90% concerning FS in classifying obesity. Three machine learning (ML) models were selected based on the best accuracy values in the literature. Moreover, both RQ1 and RQ2 have far better accuracy than other methods."
Local quantile ensemble for machine learning methods,2024,"['ensemble learning', 'quantile averaging', 'quantile crossing', 'tree-based models', 'variance reduction']",,"Quantile regression models have become popular due to their benefits in obtaining robust estimates. Some machine learning (ML) models can estimate conditional quantiles. However, current ML methods mainly focus on just adapting quantile regression.  In this paper, we propose a local quantile ensemble based on ML methods, which averages multiple estimated quantiles near the target quantile.  It is designed to enhance the stability and accuracy of the quantile fits.  This approach extends the composite quantile regression algorithm that typically considers the central tendency under a linear model.  The proposed methods can be applied to various types of data having nonlinear and heterogeneous trend.  We provide an empirical rule for choosing quantiles around the target quantile. The bias-variance tradeoff inherent in this method offers performance benefits. Through empirical studies using Monte Carlo simulations and real data sets, we demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve quantile estimation accuracy and stabilize the quantile fits."
Fault Detection of NPC Inverter Based on Ensemble Machine Learning Methods,2024,['Ensemble Machine Learning Methods · Fault detection · NPC inverter · Random forest method'],,"Three-level neutral point clamped (NPC) inverters have been widely adopted in diferent appliances, but their growing use leads to increased susceptibility to faults in the system. It is therefore essential to design precise and efcient methods that can detect inverter faults to ensure optimal control and prevent serious damage to the system. However, the most accurate fault diagnosis methods often require signifcant amounts of time to collect input data such as current and voltage images, or they involve lengthy data rows that are not commonly applicable to real-time applications. To compensate for these drawbacks, ensemble machine learning (EML) methods are proposed to detect open-circuit faults that only require one single point as an input. Moreover, the proposed methods were trained using DC-link voltage diference, time, and three phase currents to improve the accuracy of open-circuit fault detection. The feasibility and efectiveness of the proposed method are verifed through simulation and experimentation. The present work also presents a comprehensive comparison of EML methods. The results show that Random Forest (RF) and Bootstrap Aggregating (bagging) methods achieve high performance compared to other EML methods, with an accuracy of 97%, without requiring additional circuitry. Additionally, the results show that incorporating time and DC-link voltage diferences, along with three-phase current, improves the performance of EML methods."

In developing countries, the main challenge is to maintain road conditions regularly. Roads can deteriorate from time to time. Monitoring the conditions of the roads, which may degrade with time, is very difficult, resulting in a delay in transportation and damage to the vehicles moving on the roads. Poor road conditions cause road accidents. A model is being proposed to monitor the conditions of the road surface by smartphone sensors. Accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS sensors are deployed in the mobile phones, which will help to collect data on the road conditions. After collecting the data about the road conditions, various machine learning approaches, such as supervised, multi-layered, and multiclass, are applied to data filtration. Road conditions are divided into three categories to achieve this methodology: potholes, deep traverse cracks, and smooth roads. This categorization helped in analyzing the road surface condition through smartphone sensors over all three axes instead of taking it over a single axis.

Reentry Risk and Safety Assessment of Spacecraft Debris Based on Machine Learning,2024,"['Debris distribution', 'Reentry disintegration', 'Machine learning', 'Risk assessment']",,"Uncontrolled spacecraft will disintegrate and generate a large amount of debris in the reentry process. Ablative debris may cause potential risks to the safety of human life and property on the ground. Therefore, predicting the landing points of spacecraft debris and forecasting the degree of risk of waste to human life and property is very important. In view that it is difficult to predict the reentry process and the reentry point in advance, the debris generated from reentry disintegration may cause ground damage for the uncontrolled space vehicle on the expiration of service. In this paper, we adopt the object-oriented approach to consider the spacecraft and its disintegrated components as consisting of simple basic geometric models and introduce three machine learning models: the support vector regression (SVR), decision tree regression (DTR), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to predict the velocity, longitude, and latitude of spacecraft debris landing points for the first time. Then, we compare the prediction accuracy of the three models. Furthermore, we define the reentry risk and the degree of danger, and we calculate the risk level for each spacecraft debris and make warnings accordingly.

Coupled Kernel Extreme Learning Machine and Cuckoo Search for Aerodynamic Modeling and Stability Analysis of Spinning Projectiles,2024,"['Spinning projectile', 'aerodynamic model', 'kernel extreme learning machine', 'cuckoo search', 'nonlinear angular motion', 'dynamic stability']",,"The deformation of spinning projectiles induces alterations in their aerodynamic characteristics, thereby influencing flight stability. To assess the stability of spinning projectiles, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) is employed to develop the aerodynamic model of spinning projectiles. A mixed kernel is formulated by incorporating Gaussian and polynomial kernel functions to enhance the generalization ability of the model. The parameters of model are subsequently optimized using the cuckoo search (CS). Based on verifying the accuracy of the model by comparing the prediction results with the CFD results, the Lyapunov exponent method is adopted to investigate the impact of elastic deformation on the nonlinear angular motion stability of spinning projectiles, thereby revealing the mechanism of deformation on the attraction basin and stability for the angular motion. The findings reveal that the CS-based KELM with mixed kernel exhibits good reliability and accuracy in predicting the aerodynamic characteristics of spinning projectiles, with the maximum error between the predicted results and the CFD results remaining below 5%; as the deformation amplitude increases, the deformation-induced variation of yawing moment plays a leading role in the reduction of attraction basin; during the transition from convergence to divergence in the angular motion, the deformation can induce cluster oscillations prior to divergence, where the deformation-induced decrease of pitching damping moment significantly shapes the progression of the angular motion instability."
Modeling Method for Classification of Piano Music Style based on Big Data Mining and Machine Learning,2024,"['Big data mining', 'Machine learning', 'Piano music', 'Hidden Markov']",,"With the progress of music digitalization, various styles of music have been produced, and effective classification of music has become an important research direction. In this research, a model for piano-music style classification was constructed based on big data mining and machine learning algorithms. The input music signal was dealt with using framing, signal enhancement, and windowing. The Meldor Frequency Coefficient (MFC) and emotional features in the signal were extracted and fused to obtain combined features. The extracted feature vectors were input into a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for training and then a hidden Markov model (HMM) for classification and recognition. However, it was found that during the HMM training process, the algorithm produces large differences in the randomly selected initial matrix parameters, which cause the results to be trapped at a local optimum and affect the accuracy of model classification and recognition. To optimize the parameters, a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the classification model. The average Relative Percent Difference (PRD) was 2.402, the run time was 2.117 s, and the accuracy was 97.074%, which means the model can efficiently and accurately classify piano music styles."
Classification of Manners of the Prevocalic Alveolar Consonants in Machine Learning Using Dynamic Formant Transitions of Vowels in Korean Spontaneous Speech,2024,"['coarticulation', 'manner contrasts', 'dynamic formant transitions', 'machine learning']",,"The present study tried to classify the prevocalic manners of alveolar consonants using the formant transitions of the vowel in a Korean spontaneous speech corpus. Random forest and neural network models were trained and tested on selections of F1, F2, and F3 samples taken at the vowel onset and target of the vowel. It was found that prevocalic manners could not be manifested properly by the samples of any one or two formants, taken singly at the vowel onset or doubly at the vowel onset and target. Rather, both models trained on all the F1, F2, and F3 measurements taken doubly at the vowel onset and target, manifested the prevocalic manners robustly, though the random forest model outperformed the neural network model. The former model was further trained on additional predictors. Vowel identity facilitated model classification substan- tially more than F0, gender, speaking rate, and vowel duration. The contribution of the latter predictors was rather marginal."
Impact of Mitophagy-Related Genes on the Diagnosis and Development of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma via Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms,2024,"['ESCC', 'mitophagy-related genes', 'prediction model', 'machine learning', 'single-cell RNA-seq']",,"As a treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which is common and fatal, mitophagy is a conserved cellular mechanism that selectively removes damaged mitochondria and is crucial for cellular homeostasis. While tumor development and resistance to anticancer therapies are related to ESCC, their role in ESCC remains unclear. Here, we investigated the relationship between mitophagy-related genes (MRGs) and ESCC to provide novel insights into the role of mitophagy in ESCC prognosis and diagnosis prediction. First, we identified MRGs from the GeneCards database and examined them at both the single-cell and transcriptome levels. Key genes were selected and a prognostic model was constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. External validation was performed using the GSE53624 dataset and Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed to identify PYCARD as a gene significantly associated with survival in ESCC. We then examined the effect of PYCARD on ESCC cell proliferation and migration and identified 169 MRGs at the single-cell and transcriptome levels, as well as the high-risk groups associated with cancer-related pathways. Thirteen key genes were selected for model construction via multiple machine learning algorithms. PYCARD, which is upregulated in patients with ESCC, was negatively correlated with prognosis and its knockdown inhibited ESCC cell proliferation and migration. Our ESCC prediction model based on mitophagy-related genes demonstrated promising results and provides more options for the management and clinical treatment of ESCC patients.Moreover, targeting or regulating PYCARD levels might offer new therapeutic strategies for ESCC patients in clinical settings."
Corrosion area detection and depth prediction using machine learning,2024,"['Ship corrosion', 'Corrosion detection', 'Depth predicting', 'Machine learning']",,"Corrosion reduces the thickness of a structure, making it less safe and reducing its lifespan. In particular, ships are vulnerable to corrosion because they are always submerged in seawater. This corrosion is identified through regular inspections of the ship structure, and gradually increases in scope if no action is taken at an early stage. In this study, we developed a model to detect the corrosion areas and predict the depth of corrosion in the detected areas. The corrosion area detection model used a machine learning model based on Mask R-CNN. The 35,753 images were used to map corrosion images and measured corrosion depths.

Nationwide spatiotemporal prediction of foot and mouth disease in Iran using machine learning (2008–2018),2024,['Foot-and-mouth disease · Spatiotemporal prediction · Machine learning · Imbalanced classification'],,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals such as sheep, cattle, goats, and buffalo. It is recognized as one of the most destructive animal diseases, primarily attributed to its signifi cant financial impact. We used a machine learning model to predict FMD occurrence at the county level in Iran from 2008 to 2018 using historical data on cases of FMD, so the monthly occurrence of FMD per county was predicted using spatial and temporal lags using the Random Forest (RF) classifier. The cost-sensitive balancing and Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (Borderline SMOTE) methods were also used to handle the imbalanced classification. The results revealed that after applying the cost-sensitive balancing method, the model’s performance, as measured by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, was 81%. However, when we implemented the Borderline SMOTE Oversampling technique, the method performance increased from 81 to 88%. We also found that our proposed model’s performance is better than when we use climate-related features to predict disease occurrence. The methodologies and f indings of this study provide valuable insights for decision-makers to make informed decisions, mitigating county-level FMD occurrences and preventing economic losses."
DNS key technologies based on machine learning and network data mining,2024,"['data management', 'domain name system', 'internet traffic', 'machine learning', 'neural network', 'security']",,"Domain Name Systems (DNS) provide critical performance in directing Internet traffic. It is a significant duty of DNS service providers to protect DNS servers from bandwidth attacks. Data mining techniques may identify different trends in detecting anomalies, but these approaches are insufficient to provide adequate methods for querying traffic data in significant network environments. The patterns can enable the providers of DNS services to find anomalies. Accordingly, this research has used a new approach to find the anomalies using the Neural Network (NN) because intrusion detection techniques or conventional rule-based anomaly are insufficient to detect general DNS anomalies using multi-enterprise network traffic data obtained from network traffic data (from different organizations). NN was developed, and its results were measured to determine the best performance in anomaly detection using DNS query data. Going through the R<sup>2</sup> results, it was found that NN could satisfactorily perform the DNS anomaly detection process. Based on the results, the security weaknesses and problems related to unpredictable matters could be practically distinguished, and many could be avoided in advance. Based on the R<sup>2</sup> results, the NN could perform remarkably well in general DNS anomaly detection processing in this study."
Predicting the compressive strength of eco-friendly concrete incorporating natural pozzolans: A hybrid machine learning modeling with SHAP and PDP analyses,2024,"['compressive strength', 'eco-friendly concrete', 'hybrid machine learning', 'natural pozzolans', 'parametric analysis']",,"The construction and materials sector is actively striving to mitigate the environmental consequences of cement production in concrete by integrating alternative and supplemental cementitious materials while reducing carbon emissions. Because of their pozzolanic reactions, natural pozzolans (NPs) have become prominent in this area. The aim of this research is to accurately predict the compressive strength of normal-weight concrete that contains NP by investigating the impact of several elements, including cement, NP content, water and aggregate quantity, and superplasticizer content. For doing this, the research examined data gathered from various sources, which led to the creation of a dataset consisting of 496 mix ratios with strengths. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using numerous advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms, including extreme gradient boosting (XGB), adaptive boosting (ADB), and bagging regressor (BAG), as well as hybrid ML techniques such as XGB-ADB and XGB-BAG. The purpose was to extensively examine the concrete mix materials and evaluate their influence on strength. The collected dataset was divided into two groups: training and testing. Statistical tests were conducted to ascertain the correlations between the input parameters and strength. Furthermore, the algorithms' performance was assessed using four separate statistical assessment criteria. The hybrid XGB-BAG model exhibited superior accuracy (test R<sup>2</sup> = 0.901) in comparison to other models. All other models also demonstrate adequate performance (R<sup>2</sup> greater than 0.80) for the use of predicting the compressive strength of NP-concrete. In addition, the SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) study indicated that cement, NPs, and superplasticizers had a beneficial impact on strength. In summary, the research indicates that the hybrid XGB-ADB model, when combined with the indicated input parameters, can effectively forecast the compressive strength of NP-concrete."
Understanding Corporate Bond Defaults in Korea Using Machine Learning Models,2024,"['Corporate bond default', 'Credit risk', 'Default prediction model', 'Accounting-based model', 'Machine learning']",,"We investigate corporate bond defaults from 1995 to 2020 using hand‐collected data from hard‐copy publications in Korea. Using an under‐sampling method, we construct default prediction models based on machine learning models as well as a logistic model. The empirical results show that the random forest model outperforms the others. However, regardless of the models used, model performance in financial crisis periods is significantly worse than it is in non‐crisis periods. This finding suggests the need for additional information to improve model performance during crises when the default prediction is the most relevant. Furthermore, the dominant predictor of defaults before the global financial crisis was the debt ratio, while subsequently, the coverage ratio has become the most important predictor."

Model 1 was parameterized with only clinical symptoms and blood tests, excluding contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) images available at the initial visit, whereas model 2 was created with the addition of the MDCT information to the model 1 parameters. Although model 2 was expected to be superior to model 1, we wanted to independently determine this conclusion. A total of 210 patients who visited the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Dankook University Dental Hospital from March 2013 to August 2023 was included in this study.

In both models, the C-reactive protein level was the most important variable, followed by DM.Conclusion: This study provides unprecedented data on the use of ML for successful prediction of ICU admission based on initial examination results.These findings will considerably contribute to the development of the field of dentistry, especially oral and maxillofacial surgery."
Selection of informative markers using machine learning approaches and genome-wide association studies to improve genomic prediction in Hanwoo cattle: a simulation study,2024,"['Extreme gradient boosting', 'Genome-wide association studies', 'Genomic prediction', 'Gradient boosting machine', 'Quantitative trait loci']",,"The present study deploys a comparison of Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in selecting optimum subsets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be used in genomic prediction in cattle. The data simulation was carried out for 6,000 animals and 47,841 SNPs which include 43,633 polygenic markers and 4208 quantitative trait loci (QTL) using QMSim software. The genomic prediction was conducted with the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) method using the BLUPF90 program. The accuracy of prediction was computed in three different types, namely, Empirical all SNPs, Empirical QTL, and theoretical accuracy, Accuracy PEV . Among the three models, the highest Empirical all SNPs accuracy 0.79 was derived for GBM followed by 0.77 for XGBoost and 0.76 for GWAS. The Empirical QTL accuracy was almost equal for all three models. The maximum theoretical accuracy was obtained for GWAS which was 0.93, whereas GBM and XGBoost obtained 0.86 and 0.85 accuracy levels respectively. Our results indicate that all three models comparably performed in genomic predictions; however, subsets selected by both GBM and GWAS reported higher prediction accuracies compared to the whole SNP set. The number of QTL selected as a proportion of the total number of SNPs was superior in GWAS. These observations can be validated using real data which could enable further optimization of the analysis process."

However, machine learning (ML) approaches can help to mitigate these problems. We aimed to determine which ML models best predicted HF severity and hospital readmissions and could be used in a patient selfmonitoring mobile application. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, we collected the data of patients admitted with HF to the Siloam Diagram Heart Center in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Data was analyzed using the Orange data mining classification method. ML support algorithms, including artificial neural network (ANN), random forest, gradient boosting, Naïve Bayes, tree-based models, and logistic regression were used to predict HF severity and hospital readmissions. The performance of these models was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, and F1-scores. Results: Of the 543 patients with HF, 3 (0.56%) were excluded due to death on admission. Hospital readmission occurred in 138 patients (25.6%). Of the six algorithms tested, ANN showed the best performance in predicting both HF severity (AUC = 1.000, accuracy = 0.998, F1-score = 0.998) and readmission for HF (AUC = 0.998, accuracy = 0.975, F1-score = 0.972). Other studies have shown variable results for the best algorithm to predict hospital readmission in patients with HF. Conclusions: The ANN algorithm performed best in predicting HF severity and hospital readmissions and will be integrated into a mobile application for patient self-monitoring to prevent readmissions."

Our focus centers on the assessment of RF and analog electrical characteristics, with a keen eye on the high-temperature eff ects. The influence of temperature on device performance is meticulously evaluated in comparison to a reference device operating at room temperature.

The findings from the fresh characteristics test indicate that mixes’ optimal flowability and passing qualities can be achieved using different concentrations of marble powder (MP) alongside a consistent amount of silica fume (SF) and fly ash (FA). Moreover, the incorporation of 10% MP along with 10% FA and 20% SF in HSSCC significantly improved the compressive strength by 14.68%, while the splitting tensile strength increased by 15.59% compared to the reference mix at 56 days. While random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and their ensemble models exhibit strong coefficient correlation (R2) values, the GB model demonstrates more precision, indicating reliable predicted outcomes of the mechanical properties. Following subsequent testing, it has been demonstrated that incorporating SCMs improves the NDT properties of HSSCC and enhances its durability. The finer MP, SF, and FA particles enhanced microstructural performance by minimizing voids and cracks while improving the C–H–S bond. As noticed by its lower CO2-eq per MPa for SCMs, the HSSCC mix with up to 15% MP inclusion increased mechanical strength while reducing the environmental footprint, making it an eco-friendly concrete alternative."
Genetic classification of various familial relationships using the stacking ensemble machine learning approaches,2024,"['familial relationships', 'Korean family', 'STR marker', 'likelihood ratio', 'genetic classification', 'machine learning', 'stacking ensemble model']",,"Familial searching is a useful technique in a forensic investigation.

Modeling CO2 Loading Capacity of Diethanolamine (DEA) Aqueous Solutions Using Advanced Deep Learning and Machine Learning Algorithms: Application to Carbon Capture,2024,['Carbon capture · Diethanolamine (DEA) · CO 2 loading capacity · Recurrent Neural Networks · Intelligent model'],,"Several carbon capture techniques have been developed in response to the notable rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) levels. The utilization of diethanolamine (DEA) as an absorption method is prevalent in various industries due to its high reactivity and cost-effi ciency. Hence, comprehending the equilibrium solubility of CO2 in DEA solutions is an essential step in developing and optimizing absorption procedures. In order to predict the CO2 loading capacity in the DEA solutions, four advanced deep learning and machine learning models were developed: recurrent neural networks (RNN), deep neural networks (DNN), random forest (RF), and adaBoost-support vector regression (AdaBoost-SVR). The models predict the capacity of CO2 loading as a function of temperature, CO2 partial pressure, and the concentration of DEA in the solution.Intelligent models were developed employing an extensive database which includes new experimental data points published within recent years, which were not considered in the previous studies. The RNN model was found to outperform other models based on graphical and statistical assessments, as evidenced by its lower root mean square error ( RMSE = 0.285 ) and standard deviation ( SD = 0.032 ), and higher determination coeffi cient ( R2 = 0.992 ). While the RNN model resulted in the highest accuracy in predicting CO2 absorption, the DNN, RF, and AdaBoost-SVR models also demonstrated satisfactory accuracy in predicting CO2 solubility, placed in the following ranking. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the four developed models, revealing that the CO2 partial pressure has the strongest eff ect on the CO2 loading capacity. Furthermore, a trend analysis was performed on the RNN model, demonstrating that the developed model has a high degree of accuracy in following physical trends. The binary interaction analysis was conducted with two varying parameters and one constant parameter in the RNN model through 3-D image plots, which illustrated the simultaneous eff ect of two independent parameters on CO2 loading. Finally, outlier detection was conducted by employing the Leverage method to fi nd outlier data points in the data bank, demonstrating the applicability domain of intelligent models."

The second stage focus on the fault subcomponents inside the main components further, in which the time generative adversarial network (TimeGAN) is adopted to enhance the fault code data samples, then the enhanced data in the form of grayscale images is input into the Vision Transformer (ViT) to train the subcomponent early warning model. The proposed method is validated with real SCADA data, the results show the efectiveness of the proposed method."
Applications of Big Data and AI-Driven Technologies in High-Dimensional Data Analysis: Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction Using Machine Learning Models with Factor Analysis,2024,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Factor Analysis', 'Corporate Data', 'Bankruptcy Prediction']",,"Artificial intelligence techniques have been developed in the prediction of corporate bankruptcy over time. The first step in the analysis of real-world data on bankrupt companies is to include multicollinearity, which has an adverse impact on biased estimation and possibly causes large errors. Studies in finance have presented potential problems affected by a strong association between the features and the outcome in the dataset, but examining the role of the factor analysis techniques which handle bias in the corporate data is at a nascent stage. The integrative big data analytics can be utilized to combine unsupervised learning to understand the structures of high-dimensional data with supervised learning to classify the target outcome efficiently. In this study, the results of the big data analytics show that random forest classification with factor analysis outperforms other big data analysis techniques in terms of predictive accuracy. The goal of this study is to minimize the gap between the theoretical concepts of artificial intelligence techniques and the analysis of real-world financial data, in addition to developing big data analytics methods on high-dimensional data with strongly associated corporate features. The method proposed in this study can be applied to similarly structured data which may contribute to understanding the interplay between corporate bankruptcy and financial features."

Machine Learning Modeling of the Mechanical Properties of Al2024- B4C Composites,2024,"['Artificial neural network (ANN)', 'Aluminum-based composite', 'Density', 'Mechanical performance', 'Index of relative importance']",,"Aluminum-based composites are in high demand in industrial fields due to their light weight, high electrical conductivity, and corrosion resistance. Due to its unique advantages for composite fabrication, powder metallurgy is a crucial player in meeting this demand. However, the size and weight fraction of the reinforcement significantly influence the components' quality and performance. Understanding the correlation of these variables is crucial for building high-quality components. This study, therefore, investigated the correlations among various parameters-namely, milling time, reinforcement ratio, and size-that affect the composite's physical and mechanical properties. An artificial neural network model was developed and showed the ability to correlate the processing parameters with the density, hardness, and tensile strength of Al2024-B<sub>4</sub>C composites.

In this paper, an artificial neural network has been used to predict the compressive strength of concrete for four cases, namely concrete without cement replacement, and binary, ternary, and quaternary cement concretes corresponding to one, two and three different SCMs in the mix. To predict the strength accurately, a total of 1013 data were collected from 37 literature and trained using two training algorithms namely Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian Regularization (BR). The best predictions were achieved using one hidden layer with 14 and 15 neurons for LM and BR algorithms respectively. A high accuracy has been achieved with a correlation factor of 0.97 and 0.966 using the BR and LM algorithms respectively, with a20-index of 83%. Generally, the BR algorithm gives a better overall performance, while underestimating the compressive strength compared to LM. Sensitivity analysis has also been investigated using linear and quadratic regressions. The findings showed that the highest contributors to concrete strength were cement and water, while the lowest contributor was coarse aggregate."

A Wind Speed Forecasting Method Based on Machine Learning for Operating Unguided Submunitions from a Cluster Munition,2024,"['Wind speed forecasting', 'Artificial Neural Network (ANN)', 'Ballistic weapon', 'Non-linear regression']",,"Wind forecasting is essential when operating ballistic weapons, including an aircraft-mounted cluster munition. Simple linear wind models are commonly employed for wind forecasting. This paper presents a novel approach for predicting wind direction and speed at intermediate altitudes from the release point to the ground. It is based on ANN-based nonlinear regression function trained on wind historical data collected at observation stations where wind is measured at 10-min intervals using wind observation equipment. The dataset used for ANN training was obtained by processing and utilizing data downloaded from the Korea Meteorological Administration Open MET Data Portal. This dataset includes valuable information such as measurement locations, dates, times, altitudes, wind directions, and wind speeds for eleven observation stations in South Korea. Also, we propose a method to employ spatial interpolation techniques for wind speed prediction in areas without observation stations, thus developing a wind speed prediction model for the entire South Korean region. The spatial interpolation technique utilized the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method, which assigns greater weight to the actual values from nearby observation stations when performing interpolation. To evaluate the performance of the proposed WSP-ANN model, a comparative analysis was conducted with the predictions of the common launch acceptability region approach (CLARA)’s simple linear wind model proposed by the United States Air Force and SAE International. The results clearly demonstrated that the proposed WSP-ANN model outperforms the CLARA’s simple linear wind model in terms of wind prediction performance."

The instrumented indentation technique is a minimally invasive approach that can be conveniently used to determine the residual stress in structural materials in service. Because the indentation behavior of a structure with residual stresses is closely related to the elastic-plastic behavior of the indented material, an accurate understanding of the elastic-plastic behavior of the material is essential for evaluation of the residual stresses in the structures. However, due to the analytical problems associated with solving the elastic-plastic behavior, empirical equations with limited applicability have been used. In the present study, the impact of the non-equibiaxial residual stress state on indentation behavior was investigated using finite element analysis. In addition, a new nonequibiaxial residual-stress prediction methodology is proposed using a convolutional neural network, and the performance was validated. A more accurate residual-stress measurement will be possible by applying the proposed residual-stress prediction methodology in the future."

Microscopic images are often used to assess stomatal characteristics in plants; however, this can be a challenging task. By utilizing Matterport’s Mask R-CNN implementation as the foundational model, fine-tuning was conducted on a dataset of 810 microscopic images of Hedyotis corymbosa leaves’ surfaces for automated stomatal pores detection. The outcomes were promising, with the model achieving a convergence of 98% mean average precision (mAP) for both detection and segmentation. The training loss and validation loss values converged around 0.18 and 0.37, respectively. Regression analyses demonstrated the statistical significance (p values ≤ 0.05) of predictor parameters. Notably, the tightest cluster of data points was observed in stomata pore area meas- urements, followed by width and length. This highlights the precision of the stomatal pore area in characterizing stomatal traits. Despite challenges posed by the original dataset’s low-resolution images and artifacts like dust, bubbles, and blurriness, our innovative utilization of the Mask R-CNN algorithm yielded commendable outcomes. This research introduces a robust approach for stomatal phenotyping with broad applications in plant biology and environmental studies."

In this study, we conducted comprehensive metabolomic analyses of kimchi cabbage grown in diverse environments throughout the year. We identiﬁ ed 15 primary metabolites, 10 glu- cosinolates, and 12 hydrolysates, providing valuable insights into the metabolic composition of kimchi cabbage. Using this data, we developed predictive models for taste and quality diﬀ erentiation in kimchi cabbage based on the season of cultivation. Three regression models, including Orthogonal Partial Least Squares regression (OPLS), Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, and Random Forest regression, were employed to predict seasonal variation. The models exhibited high accuracy, with R   values ranging from 0.77 to 0.95, indicating their potential for distinguishing seasonal diﬀ erences. Nota- 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 bly, hydroxyglucobrassicin, 5-oxoproline, and inositol consistently emerged as signiﬁ cant metabolites across all models. Additionally, we developed regression models for predicting sweetness and bitterness in kimchi cabbage. Metabolites such as malic acid, fructose, and glucose were positively correlated with sweetness, while neoglucobrassicin and glucobras- sicin were negatively correlated. Conversely, metabolites like glucoerucin and glucobrassicin were positively correlated with bitterness, while malic acid and sucrose were negatively correlated.

Quantification of methane emissions in rice paddies: A machine learning approach with rice cultivar and transplanting date,2024,"['CH4', 'Climate change', 'Multiple linear regression (MLR)', 'Prediction', 'Rice cultivation']",,"Estimates of methane (CH4) emissions from rice paddies are crucial to assess the contribution of rice production in mitigating or adapting climate change. This study aimed to develop a predictive model for estimating the CH4 emissions in rice paddies, and suggest rice production strategies for sustainable agriculture. The parameters for constructing the CH4 emissions predictive model were obtained from field-based experiments from 2022 to 2023 in Daejeon, South Korea and separated as follows: climatic factors (i.e., mean temperatures of atmosphere, soil, and water, annual total precipitation), cultivation factors (i.e., cultivar and transplanting date), and soil properties (i.e., pH, organic matter, and bulk density). Additionally, before the developing the predictive model, each variable underwent significance test (p < 0.05). The statistical relationship and regression analysis of the CH4 emissions were followed the Pearson correlation method and multiple linear regression (MLR) algorithm, respectively. Consequently, the CH4 emissions had the negative correlation with the mean water temperature, total precipitation, transplanting date, and bulk density, where the mean water temperature had the highest negative coefficient at -0.824. In contrast, the CH4 emissions were raised by the increase in the mean atmospheric temperature (+0.231) and organic matter content (+0.391). The predictive model for forecasting the CH4 emissions had the coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.836, which exhibits the reliability of 84% for estimating the CH4 emissions. In predictive model, soil bulk density (+18.2933) had the highest influence, while total precipitation exhibited the lowest coefficient at -0.0426. The statistical metrics, which showed the range and occurrence of residuals in the predictive model, were evaluated at 8.802 kg ha-1 and 7.235%, respectively. These findings serve as a valuable tool for establishing strategies to estimate the CH4 emissions in rice production, whereas expanding the dataset to include various experimental regions was needed to enhance the model’s performance."

Here, we present a novel approach to identify the associations of ewe metabolites and classify the outcome by including the interactions of ewe metabolites in the network. After using metabolite sub-networks as clusters, we implement lasso for logistic regression to determine the onset of hypoxia. We tested different clustering methods in order to validate the associations of ewe metabolites which may infer the mechanism of significant metabolic processes. We validated, in terms of accuracy and balanced F-score, the performance of classification method to determine whether the onset of hypoxemia is correctly identified. Our study shows that there exist strongly interacting ewe metabolites and that specific metabolites are strongly associated with hypoxia. The proposed approach can be applied to similarly structured metabolite datasets to predict health outcomes."

Data were enhanced through histogram stretching, facilitating the identification of marine plastic debris. Various indices were derived to facilitate the creation of training sets for six models. Each model underwent five tests using a support vector machine and random forest classifiers. Key spectral bands such as B6 (red-edge 2), B8 (near infrared), and B11 (SWIR 1) were pivotal in the classification process. This study illustrates the effectiveness of SVM and RF algorithms in detecting plastic debris, showcasing true and false detection rates. Spectral profiles of various plastic items, including bags, fishnets, and bottles, were analyzed, revealing strong near-infrared reflectance and low red-edge reflectance. Plastic pixels were categorized based on the percentage of plastic coverage, influencing reflectance intensity. Accuracy assessments for the six tests in both the models are presented, highlighting three significant plastic debris groupings near the coast and one near Vedaranyam, with the remaining detections not classified as plastic debris. An automatic floating plastic recognition system was developed and tested in the Nagapattinam area using the best-performing model, identifying floating plastic with an 80–95% accuracy. The Floating Debris Index was the most crucial for identifying marine floating plastic. The study concludes that the distinct reflectance characteristics of plastic facilitate its identification among marine debris, with model accuracies."

Research on replacement drivers is limited due to their widespread nature. This study examined the levels of presenteeism and absenteeism among replacement drivers in comparison to those of paid male workers in the Republic of Korea.Methods This study collected data for replacement drivers and used data from the 6th Korean Working Conditions Survey for paid male workers over the age of 20 years. Propensity score matching was performed to balance the differences between paid workers and replacement drivers. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals for presenteeism and absenteeism by replacement drivers. Stratified analysis was conducted for age groups, educational levels, income levels, and working hours. The analysis was adjusted for variables including age, education, income, working hours, working days per week, and working duration.Results Among the 1,417 participants, the prevalence of presenteeism and absenteeism among replacement drivers was 53.6% (n = 210) and 51.3% (n = 201), respectively. The association of presenteeism and absenteeism (adjusted OR [95% CI] = 8.42 [6.36−11.16] and 20.80 [95% CI = 14.60−29.62], respectively) with replacement drivers being significant, with a prominent association among the young age group, high educational, and medium income levels.Conclusion The results demonstrated that replacement drivers were more significantly associated with presenteeism and absenteeism than paid workers. Further studies are necessary to establish a strategy to decrease the risk factors among replacement drivers."

These changes transcend specific academic disciplines, positioning AI as essential knowledge for everyone. Consequently, the importance of formulating AI-related policies and education is increasingly emphasized worldwide. Additionally, as the significance of data-driven decision-making grows, the demand for skills such as data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning is rising.Universities should teach these skills to students to equip them with practical abilities. However, most universities only distinguish between IT majors and non-majors, offering the same curriculum to both groups. This approach does not adequately consider students' diverse learning backgrounds and levels, leading to various problems and difficulties in course content and teaching methods.To address these issues, it is crucial to consider students' diversity and provide them with the autonomy to choose courses that match their levels and interests. This selective, level-based learning approach is expected to result in high satisfaction with AI-related courses, regardless of prior AI learning experience.In this study, we proposed a revised AI liberal arts curriculum comprising three detailed courses: AI and Data Foundations, AI and Machine Learning, and AI Development and Practice. This redesigned curriculum allows students to choose personalized learning pathways and implements an Engaged Learning (EL) model. The study analyzed satisfaction levels regarding course content, evaluation methods, and the EL model by dividing students into two groups based on their prior AI learning experience.The findings confirmed that allowing students to select courses aligned with their levels and interests is more important than their prior AI knowledge. Additionally, implementing the Engaged Learning model proved effective for course delivery.

The main findings follow. First, “self-efficacy in mathematics subjects, assignments, and learning” emerged as the most significant factor in the basic learning skill achievements of vocational school students. Second, the use of digital and ICT tools connected to subject classes and learning was positively related to basic learning skill achievements, whereas general digital and ICT usage, unrelated to learning, showed a negative relationship. Third, students who had educational experience supplementing basic skills during their elementary school years are now more likely to achieve basic learning skills. Lastly, the family environment plays a crucial role in supporting the basic learning skill achievements of vocational school students, with “warm interest” in students’ school life being more important than socioeconomic background factors, such as parents’ educational level or income.

Teachable Machine을 활용한 운동 상해 가능성 예측모델 구현,2024,"['Injury Prediction Model', 'Teachable Machine in Exercise', 'Exercise injuries', 'Weight training']",,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop a model that can predict the probability of injuries occurring during weight training by utilizing machine learning algorithms for data analysis.Method: For this purpose, this study utilized Google’s machine learning tool and Teachable Machine. The exercise movements chosen were Deadlift and Overhead Press, commonly used in weight training, while the injury movement was defined as the back rounding. Participants were trained to differentiate between “correct movements” and “injury movements,” which were then used to train the Teachable Machine to develop an injury identification model. The model’s error rate was then assessed using evaluation participants to determine its actual error rate.Results: The Deadlift identification model and the Overhead Press identification model both achieved a class accuracy of 1.00 for both correct and injury-inducing postures, with a confusion matrix of 0. The learning rate per epoch and loss graph per epoch peaked early in the training process. The error rate of the injury identification model was 19% for the Deadlift identification model and 12% for the Overhead Press identification model.Conclusion: The high accuracy per class and the result of the confusion matrix indicate effective hyperparameter adjustment. The overfitting observed in the learning rate and loss graph per epoch is likely due to the limited diversity in the training data, a characteristic of the study. The higher-than-expected error rate in the injury identification model is attributed to the constraints of the 2D posture estimation inherent in the Teachable Machine Pose Project, which relies on a Skeleton-Based Model that limits the representation of the human body in a 2D space."

Musical Genre Classification Based on Deep Residual Auto-Encoder and Support Vector Machine,2024,"['Deep Residual Auto-Encoder', 'MFCC', 'Music Artificial Intelligence', 'Musical Genre Classification']",,"Music brings pleasure and relaxation to people. Therefore, it is necessary to classify musical genres based on scenes. Identifying favorite musical genres from massive music data is a time-consuming and laborious task. Recent studies have suggested that machine learning algorithms are effective in distinguishing between various musical genres. However, meeting the actual requirements in terms of accuracy or timeliness is challenging. In this study, a hybrid machine learning model that combines a deep residual auto-encoder (DRAE) and support vector machine (SVM) for musical genre recognition was proposed. Eight manually extracted features from the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) were employed in the preprocessing stage as the hybrid music data source. During the training stage, DRAE was employed to extract feature maps, which were then used as input for the SVM classifier. The experimental results indicated that this method achieved a 91.54% F1-score and 91.58% top-1 accuracy, outperforming existing approaches. This novel approach leverages deep architecture and conventional machine learning algorithms and provides a new horizon for musical genre classification tasks."
How machine translation systems handle relative clause attachment: A comparative analysis,2024,"['AI', 'machine translation', 'relative clauses attachment', 'structural ambiguity', '인공지능', '기계번역', '관계절 부착', '구조적 중의성']",,"The use of machine translators (MTs) in teaching and learning English has increased in recent years. This study investigates how English-to-Korean and Korean-to-English MTs handle relative clause (RC) attachment. A total of 72 sentences-36 English and 36 Korean-were collected from 16 research articles on RC attachment. The collected RC attachment items were categorized into three types: ambiguous, high attachment (HA), and low attachment (LA). English RCs with ambiguity (n=18) were translated into ambiguous Korean RCs; LA preference sentences (n=16) were translated into Korean RCs as LA. However, Korean RCs with ambiguity (n=34) were translated into ambiguous English RCs or HA preference sentences. Results showed that RCs with ambiguity in English and Korean were translated differently into the target language. The main cause of this distinction seemed to be that Korean RCs involving genitive case -uy were translated into English RCs using prepositions such as of and the genitive -’s. These two possible structures resulted in two different outcomes in English: (i) NP-of-NP structures, where ambiguity is preserved, or (ii) NP’s NP structures, where only HA preference was possible. These findings suggest that RC attachment is translated differently between the two languages by MTs."
Analysis of Relative Clauses in English-to-Korean Machine Translation Systems’ Output,2024,"['AI', 'machine translation', 'relative clauses', '인공지능', '기계번역', '관계절']",,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools for teaching and learning English as a foreign language has become increasingly functional in Second Language Acquisition (SLA). This study aimed to explore the potential of English-to-Korean machine translators (MTs) as interactive tools for language learning, specifically for Korean EFL learners. The study assessed the accuracy of two commonly used MTs in converting English Relative Clauses (RCs) into Korean equivalents by analyzing translation data from research articles. A total of 60 articles provided 513 examples of RCs. The study analyzed the output of MTs in three ways: (i) whether the translated meaning accurately represented the targeted form, (ii) what types of errors the Korean translations made, and (iii) how the results compared to previous works on Korean-to- English translation of RCs. The results showed that currently available English-to- Korean MTs could produce semantically correct translations at high rates (around 95%). However, they make errors such as omitting lexical elements, resulting in structural ambiguity. Compared to previous works, the accuracy rate has gradually improved. These findings suggest that MTs have great potential as aids in English reading and writing instruction."

The evaluation of credit risk holds great significance in the financial realm, impacting both companies and individuals. While credit risk prediction has been explored using statistical and machine learning techniques, their application to tax arrears prediction remains underexplored. We forecast individual local tax defaults in Republic of Korea using machine and deep learning algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq). Our model incorporates diverse credit and public information like loan history, delinquency records, credit card usage, and public taxation data, offering richer insights than prior studies. The results highlight the superior predictive accuracy of the CNN model. Anticipating local tax arrears more effectively could lead to efficient allocation of administrative resources.

Multi-dimensional Contextual Conditions-driven Mutually Exclusive Learning for Explainable AI in Decision-Making,2024,"['Mutually Exclusive Learning', 'Multi-dimensional Contextual Conditions', 'Explainable AI (XAI)', 'Mutually Exclusive Decision-Making']",,"There are various machine learning techniques such as Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Network Learning, and so on. In recent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are popularly used for Generative AI based on Reinforcement Learning. It makes decisions with the most optimal rewards through the fine tuning process in a particular situation. Unfortunately, LLMs can not provide any explanation for how they reach the goal because the training is based on learning of black-box AI. Reinforcement Learning as black-box AI is based on graph-evolving structure for deriving enhanced solution through adjustment by human feedback or reinforced data. In this research, for mutually exclusive decision-making, Mutually Exclusive Learning (MEL) is proposed to provide explanations of the chosen goals that are achieved by a decision on both ends with specified conditions. In MEL, decision-making process is based on the tree-based structure that can provide processes of pruning branches that are used as explanations of how to achieve the goals. The goal can be reached by trade-off among mutually exclusive alternatives according to the specific contextual conditions.Therefore, the tree-based structure is adopted to provide feasible solutions with the explanations based on the pruning branches. The sequence of pruning processes can be used to provide the explanations of the inferences and ways to reach the goals, as Explainable AI (XAI). The learning process is based on the pruning branches according to the multi-dimensional contextual conditions. To deep-dive the search, they are composed of time window to determine the temporal perspective, depth of phases for lookahead and decision criteria to prune branches. The goal depends on the policy of the pruning branches, which can be dynamically changed by configured situation with the specific multi-dimensional contextual conditions at a particular moment. The explanation is represented by the chosen episode among the decision alternatives according to configured situations. In this research, MEL adopts the tree-based learning model to provide explanation for the goal derived with specific conditions. Therefore, as an example of mutually exclusive problems, employment process is proposed to demonstrate the decision-making process of how to reach the goal and explanation by the pruning branches. Finally, further study is discussed to verify the effectiveness of MEL with experiments."

Material-Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using Property-Concatenated Transfer Learning in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing,2024,"['Wire arc additive manufacturing', 'Anomaly detection', 'Transfer learning', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Quality monitoring', 'Material property']",,"Wire arc additive manufacturing is a promising additive manufacturing process because of its high deposition rate, and material diversity. However, the low quality of melted parts is a critical issue, owing to the difficulty in establishing design rules for process–structure–property–performance. Previous studies have resolved this challenge by deriving anomaly detection models for quality monitoring and have largely relied on machine learning by training melt pool image data. Acquiring sufficient data is a key to obtaining reliable models in machine learning; however, an issue arises from concerning the cost intensiveness in high-cost materials. We propose a material-adaptive anomaly detection method to detect balling defects in a target material using property-concatenated transfer learning. First, transfer learing is applied to derive convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models from a source material and transfer them to a target material, wherein data are insufficient and machine learning rarely achieves high performance. Second, material properties are concatenated on transfer learning as additional features onto image features, contrary to typical transfer learning where CNNs only extract image features. We perform experiments in a gas tungsten arc welding system with low-carbon steel (LCS), stainless steel (STS), and inconel (INC) materials. Our models achieve best classification accuracies of 82.95%, 89.47%, and 84.22% when transferring from LCS to STS, LCS to INC, and STS to INC, respectively, compared with 78.03%, 86.37%, and 73.63% obtained using typical transfer learning. The proposed method can effectively resolve the data scarcity by model transfer from sufficient datasets in low-cost materials to rare datasets in high-cost materials. Moreover, it outperforms typical transfer learning because material properties are learned as manufacturing-knowledge features, accounting for melting and hardening characteristics of materials."

Federated Learning of Lung Nodule Detection Based on Dual Mechanism Differential Privacy Protection,2024,"['Lung Nodule Detection', 'Medical Image Detection', 'Data Privacy', 'Federated Learning', 'Differential Privacy']",,"With the development of society, data privacy is becoming more and more important, and a large number of laws have been promulgated in many countries and regions. Such a strict legal environment brings about the problems of small scale and fragmentation of data, and federated learning holds a very good prospect in solving these problems. Lung cancer has the highest incidence rate and mortality rate in the world. Lung nodule detection can effectively prevent lung cancer. Therefore, we propose federated learning for lung nodule detection, which collaboratively builds shared machine learning models without exposing local datasets. However, semi-honest adversaries and malicious adversaries can steal data privacy by participating in federated learning, and it is not enough to protect privacy by federated learning alone. Therefore, differential privacy is often used to protect privacy in federated learning. In this paper, the experimental analysis shows that the higher the degree of differential privacy perturbation, the lower the model accuracy, and the better the privacy protection effect. Because differential privacy is data used to achieve data protection, it hides the real original data, and the loss of data after differential privacy technology processing leads to the loss of model accuracy. We propose dual mechanism differential privacy applied to federated learning, which retains certain original characteristics without degrading the privacy protection performance by manipulating data subspace. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on real data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

This study developed an anomaly-detection method based on unsupervised machines and deep learning for a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). We present a hybrid anomaly detection approach based on unsupervised learning techniques using the autoencoder (AE), Isolation Forest (IF), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithms. An oversampling approach that increased the detection rate was also examined. A hybrid approach that combined deep learning algorithms and traditional machine learning algorithms was highly effective in setting the thresholds for anomalies without subjective human judgment. It achieved precision and recall rates respectively of 88.2% and 92.8% when combining two AEs, IF, and LOF while using an oversampling approach to learn more unknown normal data improved the detection accuracy. This approach achieved precision and recall rates respectively of 88.2% and 94.6%, further improving the detection accuracy compared with the hybrid method. Therefore, in NIDS the proposed approach provides high reliability for detecting cyberattacks."

Comparative analysis of chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) diagnosis in rat kidneys using an artificial intelligence deep learning model,2024,['Deep learning · Histopathology · Chronic progressive nephropathy · YOLOv8 · Mask R-CNN · SOLOv2'],,"With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), technologies based on machines and deep learning are being used in many academic fields. In toxicopathology, research is actively underway to analyze whole slide image (WSI)-level images using AI deep-learning models. However, few studies have been conducted on models for diagnosing complex lesions comprising multiple lesions. Therefore, this study used deep learning segmentation models (YOLOv8, Mask R-CNN, and SOLOv2) to identify three representative lesions (tubular basophilia with atrophy, mononuclear cell infiltration, and hyaline casts) of chronic progressive nephropathy of the kidney, a complex lesion observed in a non-clinical test using rats and selected an initial model appropriate for diagnosing complex lesions by analyzing the characteristics of each algorithm. Approximately 2000 images containing three lesions were extracted using 33 WSI of rat kidneys with chronic progressive nephropathy.Among them, 1701 images were divided into first and second rounds of learning. The loss and mAP50 values were measured twice to confirm the performances of the three algorithms. Loss measurements were stopped at an appropriate epoch to prevent overfitting, and the loss value decreased in the second round based on the data learned in the first round. After measuring the accuracy twice, detection using Mask R-CNN showed the highest mAP50 in all lesions among the three models and was considered sufficient as an initial model for diagnosing complex lesions. By contrast, the YOLOv8 and SOLOv2 models showed low accuracy for all three lesions and had difficulty with segmentation tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes a Mask R-CNN as the initial model for segmenting complex lesions. Precise diagnosis is possible if the model can be trained by increasing the input data, thereby providing greater accuracy in diagnosing pathological images."

Ensemble Learning Based on Feature Selection and Distance Normalization for Enhancing Corn and Weed Classification,2024,"['Handcrafted', 'Ensemble learning', 'Information gain', 'Chebyshev normalization', 'Weed']",,"Weeds need to be removed from the immediate areas surrounding crops as they compete for soil nutrients. Farmers currently clear weeds manually, which is both tiring and imprecise. Therefore, researchers have developed artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning or non-handcrafted methods to facilitate precise detection. However, these methods have yet to achieve real-time inference speeds. Consequently, this study adopts a handcrafted approach that employs visual leaf features for classification via ensemble learning. The objective is to employ feature selection and data normalization to create an accurate and efficient machine-learning model. The experimental findings obtained in this work demonstrate that Information Gain effectively reduces features by 50%, from 22 to 11, while maintaining accuracy. Chebyshev normalization emerges as the most suitable normalization technique, as it significantly enhances classification accuracy in ensemble learning. The accuracy obtained when using histogram gradient boosting is found to be 0.92 with an inference time of 5.955 ms per image. These outcomes illustrate that handcrafted features achieve higher accuracy than non-handcrafted methods, ultimately improving efficiency and enabling real-time implementation."

Supervised Learning in Model Reference Adaptive Sliding Mode Control,2024,"['Adaptive control', 'adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC)', 'back-propagation algorithm', 'chattering reduction', 'model reference adaptive control (MRAC)', 'online learning algorithms.']",,"The well known back-propagation algorithm has revolutionized machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly in neural network applications. Although gradient descent-based algorithms are utilized in control applications, they are not as prevalent as in neural network applications. This discrepancy can be attributed to the successful development of various adaptation laws which ensure system stability while meeting the required design criteria. Many of these laws can be found in model reference adaptive control (MRAC) and adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC). This paper investigates the applicability of the Brandt-Lin (B-L) learning algorithm, mathematically equivalent to the back-propagation algorithm, in adaptive control applications. We find that combining the B-L learning algorithm with SMC yields a robust controller suitable for model reference adaptive sliding mode control (MRA-SMC). The controller is applicable to linear and a class of nonlinear dynamic systems and is suitable for efficient implementation. We derive the stability criteria for this controller and conduct simulations to study the adaptation’s impact on chattering. Our work exemplifies one approach to adopt the back-propagation algorithm in control applications."

Initially, the utilization ofimpedance control is not confined to merely adjusting the desired trajectory but is also instrumental in ensuringactive compliance control during the robot-assisted bathing procedure. Furthermore, an iterative learning control(ILC) is devised to estimate the iteration-invariant dynamic parameters, which are intricate and challenging to precisely ascertain in practical applications. To mitigate the effect of divergent initial conditions in ILC, a trajectoryreconstruction method is introduced, thus ensuring the convergence of tracking errors even when starting from random initial states. Moreover, an adaptive sliding mode control mechanism is proposed to counteract non-parametricexternal disturbances and the torque generated through human-machine interaction during the bathing process. Theconvergence of the double closed-loop system in both the time and iterative domains is demonstrated through theapplication of the composite energy function method. Eventually, the efficacy and superiority of the control strategyoutlined in this paper are jointly verified through co-simulation employing MATLAB and ADAMS."

EPDR: An Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Disease Research System with Horizontal Federated Learning in the Internet of Medical Things,2024,"['Internet of Medical Things', 'Machine Learning', 'Federated Learning', 'Privacy-Preserving']",,"The combination of machine learning (ML) and the Internet of Medical Things has emerged as one of the most critical modes for disease diagnoses and treatments. As the medical data in IoMT is sensitive, it is urgent to protect the data privacy when training a ML model. Therefore, researchers are exploring federated learning (FL), a distributed ML framework that enables participants to model together without sharing data. Nevertheless, existing works neglect to verify the reliability of the participants, the integrity, and the credibility of messages.

Differential Authentication Scheme for Electric Charging System through Light Gradient Boosting Machine,2024,"['Differential authentication', 'Data-driven', 'Electric vehicle charging patterns', 'Machine learning']",,"The network security of Plug-and-Charge (PnC) technology in electric vehicle charging systems is typically achieved through the well-known Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which causes high communication overhead. To reduce this overhead, a differential authentication method employing different schemes for individual users has been proposed. However, decisions use a simple threshold approach and no quantitative performance evaluation should be made. In this study, we determined each user’s trust using several machine learning algorithms with their charging patterns and compared them. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional approach by 41.36% in terms of round-trip time efficiency, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the TLS overhead. In addition, we show the simulation results for three user authentication methods and capture the performance variations under CPU busy waiting scenarios."
Selecting Optimal Algorithms for Stroke Prediction: Machine LearningBased Approach,2024,"['Stroke prediction', 'Machine learning', 'KNHANES', 'XGBoost']",,"In this paper, we compare three models (logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) for predicting stroke occurrence using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). We evaluated these models using various metrics, focusing mainly on recall and F1 score to assess their performance. Initially, the logistic regression model showed a satisfactory recall score among the three models; however, it was excluded from further consideration because it did not meet the F1 score threshold, which was set at a minimum of 0.5. The F1 score is crucial as it considers both precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a model's accuracy. Among the models that met the criteria, XGBoost showed the highest recall rate and showed excellent performance in stroke prediction. In particular, XGBoost shows strong performance not only in recall, but also in F1 score and AUC, so it should be considered the optimal algorithm for predicting stroke occurrence. This study determines that the performance of XGBoost is optimal in the field of stroke prediction."

Attention-Based Deep Learning Framework for  Action Recognition in a Dark Environment,2024,"['Human Action Recognition', 'Infrared View Action Recognition', 'Action Recognition in Low Light', 'Activity Recognition', 'Cognitive Computing in Our Daily Lives', 'Video Processing', 'Action Recognition at Night', 'Human-Machine Interaction']",,"Human interactions and action recognition (HIAR) are critical tasks in video analytics and understanding. While HIAR has garnered significant attention in the visible spectrum, other modalities, such as infrared (IR), have posed significant challenges in achieving accurate action recognition (AR) due to hazy surface textures and inappropriate features. Current mainstream approaches typically consider either action or contextual information to recognize human action and interactions in the IR spectrum. We propose a convolutional block attention-based action and interaction recognition network (AIR-Net) that reflects both action, contextual features and can be utilized in the dark, as well as visually light environments in a broad range of applications such as surveillance, security, and healthcare. The proposed method is mainly categorized into three steps. Firstly, the video stream is passed through pre-processing, which transforms the IR input data into a sequence of frames. Next, the action features are extracted, aided by a backbone model followed by a convolutional block attention module, while contextual features are extracted using a fine-tuned InceptionV3 network. Finally, a two-stream bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network is applied to acquire temporal patterns individually. These sequence patterns are intelligently fused and forwarded to the associated unistream BiLSTM, which learns expedient information for action and interaction recognition. A comprehensive ablation study over two benchmark datasets (InfAR and NTU-RGB+D) demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the recognition performance is marginally improved on InfAR by 2.5% and achieved 80.94% on NTU-RGB+D."

Side Information Extraction using Bernoulli Distribution based Deep Learning Technique for Video Transmission,2024,['Distributed video coding (DVC) · Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) · Side information (SI) · Bernoulli distribution based convolution neural network (BDCNN)'],,"One method for improving the quality of the transmission of video is video encoding. The video encoding technique must compresses the video fles which does not compromise the quality of it. Further, the technique must be suited for any type of devices and the platforms. Studies have been focusing on new video codes frameworks called DVCs (Distributed Video Codings). Prior designs have used DWTs (Discrete Wavelet Transforms) and ELMs (Extreme Learning Machines) in domainbased DVC frameworks. ELM algorithm also resulted in several defects such as poor robustness, overftting problem and poor controllability. To overcome this issue, a new hybrid SI generation scheme utilizing DWTs and BDCNNs (Bernoulli Distribution based Convolution Neural Networks) is proposed in transforming domain-based DVC frameworks. The proposed system works in three phases where the frst stage uses three-level two-dimensional DWTs and Haar wavelets extract approximates coefcients. In the second step, the SAIWCSOs (Simulated Annealing Inertia Weight-based Chicken Swarm Optimisations) technique is used to achieve detailed coefcients optimization after BDCNNs provide the approximated estimation coefcients for the present frameworks. In the third stage, level by- level IDWT techniques retrieve eventual estimated frame Side Information in the spatial domains. The efectiveness of the codec is increased by the higher SI quality. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the suggested system performs better than the current technology regarding PSNR, MSE, and RMSE. When compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the suggested method achieves maximum levels of efectiveness of 30%, 35%, and 32%, correspondingly."

Dollar bars were generated based on intraday data for all KOSPI and KOSDAQ stocks from January 2017 to December 2023, and samples were taken from data touching the lower Bollinger Band intraday. Additionally, labeling considering the volatility of individual stocks was conducted using the triple barrier method, and the random forest model was trained on 12 features, including entry time, Bollinger Band width, and deviation. The results showed that the proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 57.4%, with precision, recall, and F1 score all measured at 0.541. This indicates that the model demonstrates significant performance in predicting three states: rise, fall, and unchanged. Feature importance analysis using MDI, MDA, and SFI confirmed that Bollinger Band width, entry time, and disparity are critical variables for the model’s predictions. Backtesting the proposed model revealed a cumulative return of 34.77% and a Sharpe ratio of 2.77, even after accounting for a 0.2% trading cost, surpassing the performance of the KOSPI and KOSDAQ over the same period. When probability-based filtering was applied, even better performance was observed. Future research should consider incorporating macroeconomic data and applying other machine learning models to compare and analyze predictive capabilities."

To this end, in order to predict factors that affect donations between the MZ generation and the senior generation, various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression analysis, are applied to build a model to determine variables that affect donation intention, and provide statistical verification and evaluation indicators.In this study, differences in donation intention by generation were expected as a variable affecting donation intention, and the senior generation was expected to show a higher donation intention tendency than the younger generation.However, although the research results were not statistically significant, the younger generation showed a higher intention to donate, and these results are interpreted to mean that value consumption and ethical consumption, which are important to today's MZ generation, also influenced donations.However, there were differences between generations in the amount of donations, and higher donation amounts were confirmed among the senior generation (those in their 50s or older) than the younger generation. In addition, the results of the logistic regression analysis showed that previous donation experience had a positive effect on future donation intention, and the more motivation and importance of donation and various social participation activities online and offline, the more active one became in donating."

The analysis focuses on 885 technology-based startups participating in the TIPS (Tech Incubator Program for Startups) initiative, selected for their capability to monitor follow-on investment activities. The determinants examined include (1) startup-specific variables: industry sector, proportion of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) majors, geographic location, revenue size, founder characteristics, equity structure, and 13 related indicators; (2) characteristics of early-stage investors: investor type, investment method, geographic location, and 4 associated indicators; and (3) investment network variables: degree centrality, community structure, closeness centrality, and 4 network-related metrics. The study hypothesizes that the scale of follow-on investments varies depending on the attributes of the startups, the characteristics of early-stage investors, and the structural properties of the investment network. To test these hypotheses, data preprocessing techniques were employed to generate machine learning-based models, analyzing the influence of each variable. The findings aim to provide empirical insights into the determinants shaping the follow-on investment landscape in technology-driven startups. The empirical analysis results indicate that the explanatory power of the model improved when including investment network analysis variables. It was found that variables such as revenue, business sector, and investment network cohesion group of TIPS startups significantly influenced follow-up investments. The study suggests that investment network characteristics have a greater impact on follow-up investment stages than corporate information variables, such as startup characteristics and operator attributes. However, it acknowledges the limitation that the investment network among startups is indirect, based on the investment relationships between startups and investors. In future studies, supplementing with network data on direct interactions between startups or between startups and investors could better reflect the direct influence of startups and investors within the investment network. Additionally, this study provides valuable insights as an exploratory approach by quantitatively comparing and evaluating the classification and predictive performance of 7 machine learning methods."

However, due to the nature of the financial markets, obtaining large amounts of stock price data is a time-consuming and expensive endeavor. The lack of data for model building can lead to various problems such as low generalization ability and poor prediction ability. Therefore, this paper proposes a new methodology for analyzing financial markets using adversarial generative neural network-based virtual data generation simulation. In order to overcome the heavy-tail phenomenon, which is one of the limitations of the geometric Brownian motion model in modern financial theory, we approximate the actual stock return distribution by inputting random numbers extracted from the GAN to simulate future stock price fluctuations that reflect the actual market behavior. Afterward, we trained the machine learning model on the two datasets, the generated data and the real data, and developed a trading strategy to compare the trading performance. The experimental results showed that utilizing the fictitious stock price data generated by the proposed methodology improved overall performance on trading metrics, and these results suggest a new solution to overcome the limitations of financial data.

EMG utilizes small electrodes within muscles to detect and interpret user movements, presenting a viable input method. To classify user gestures based on EMG data, machine learning techniques are employed, necessitating the preprocessing of raw EMG data to extract relevant features. EMG characteristics can be expressed through formulas such as Integrated EMG (IEMG), Mean Absolute Value (MAV), Simple Square Integral (SSI), Variance (VAR), and Root Mean Square (RMS). Additionally, determining the suitable time for gesture classification is crucial, considering the perceptual, cognitive, and response times required for user input. To address this, segment sizes ranging from a minimum of 100ms to a maximum of 1,000ms are varied, and feature extraction is performed to identify the optimal segment size for gesture classification. Notably, data learning employs overlapped segmentation to reduce the interval between data points, thereby increasing the quantity of training data. Using this approach, the paper employs four machine learning models (KNN, SVC, RF, XGBoost) to train and evaluate the system, achieving accuracy rates exceeding 96% for all models in real-time gesture input scenarios with a maximum segment size of 200ms."

However, previous machine learning models for predicting the penetration rate have struggled with imbalanced data between normal and abnormal penetration rates. This study aims to enhance the performance of machine learning-based anomaly detection for the penet- ration rate by utilizing a data augmentation technique to address this data imbalance. Initially, six input features were selected through correlation analysis. The lowest and highest 10% of the penetration rates were designated as abnormal classes, while the remaining penetration rates were categorized as a normal class. Two prediction models were developed, each trained on an original training set and an oversampled training set constructed using SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique): an XGB (extreme gradient boosting) model and an XGB-SMOTE model. The predic- tion results showed that the XGB model performed poorly for the abnormal classes, despite performing well for the normal class. In contrast, the XGB-SMOTE model consistently exhibited superior performance across all classes. These findings can be attributed to the data augmentation for the abnormal penetration rates using SMOTE, which enhances the model’s ability to learn patterns between geological and operational factors that contribute to abnormal penetration rates. Consequently, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of employing data augmentation to manage imbalanced data in anomaly detection for TBM penetration rates."

First of all, RGB image data of chestnuts treated using 51 two-knife peeling process conditions were acquired. The developed model was constructed with two stages of K-means clustering and ranking systems. The Jaccard similarity index for a performance evaluation of the models was calculated. The first clustering stage was a process of separating the chestnut and background from the original image. The average Jaccard similarity index of the first clustering step was 0.92. The second clustering step was the division process of the peeled chestnut into three regions (outer shell, inner shell, and kernel). The percentage of each region was derived by dividing the number of pixels in each region by the total number of pixels in the image. The Jaccard similarity indices of the outer shell, inner shell, and kernel were 0.96, 0.88, and 0.74, respectively. As a result, machine learning-based clustering with a ranking system was proposed to analyze whether the peeling rate affects the improvement of the peel efficiency and production efficiency in the domestic chestnut industry."

To address the class imbalance in the training data, eight sampling techniques were applied. Both the original and sampled datasets were trained using XGBoost to develop a classification model and evaluate its performance.The results indicated that the model trained on data sampled using a combination of SMOTE and ENN exhibited the highest accuracy and better classified the minority class of grammatical collocations. The most influential features were 'frequency', 'minimum entropy', and 'variance of average distance'. However, limitations were identified, as the frequency and information of adjacent words alone were insufficient to fully capture the contextual meaning and grammatical characteristics of collocations. Future research should utilize transformer-based pre-trained models and embedding techniques to extract features that reflect the contextual meaning and functions of grammatical collocations.

Particularly, this attack method is characterized by its stealthiness, as victims can be redirected to phishing pages or led to download malicious software simply by scanning a QR code, making it difficult for them to realize they have been targeted. In this paper, we have developed a classification technique utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify the maliciousness of URLs embedded in QR codes, and we have explored ways to integrate this with existing QR code readers. To this end, we constructed a dataset from 128,587 malicious URLs and 428,102 benign URLs, extracting 35 different features such as protocol and parameters, and used AutoML to identify the optimal algorithm and hyperparameters, achieving an accuracy of approximately 87.37%.

Methods: To explore the characteristics and risk factors of SAMS reports, we analysed the KIDSKAERS DB from 2016 to 2020. We included reports with a causality category level of “possible” or higher. Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to identify distinctive patterns within the dataset, with a particular focus on variables such as sex, age, statin type, contraindicated drugs and concomitant drugs. The reporting characteristics were described according to the cluster. Results: Four clusters of AE reports were distinguished by hierarchical clustering: atorvastatin- and rosuvastatinassociated AE (cluster 1), pitavastatin- and simvastatin-associated AE (cluster 2), rosuvastatin-associated AE (cluster 3), and atorvastatin-associated AE (cluster 4).Cluster 1 had a relatively higher proportion of men (57 cases, 50.9%) and a higher mean age (64.8 years) than the other clusters. Concomitant drug use was more common in cluster 1 (56 cases, 50.0%) than in other clusters (33.5%–46.2%), and all serious AEs were observed in cluster 1. Conclusion: Using hierarchical clustering, we found four distinct clusters based on SAMS report characteristics. Our findings further emphasize that patients prescribed statins, especially elderly male patients taking rosuvastatin and atorvastatin concomitantly with other medications, should be closely monitored for the development of rhabdomyolysis.

Enhancing not just the inherent model performance but also accounting for model characteristics and preprocessing data are crucial elements for precise dam inflow prediction. Particularly, existing rainfall data, derived from snowfall amounts through heating facilities, introduces distortions in the correlation between snow accumulation and rainfall, especially in dam basins influenced by snow accumulation, such as Soyang Dam. This study focuses on the preprocessing of rainfall data essential for the application of ML&DL models in predicting dam inflow in basins affected by snow accumulation. This is vital to address phenomena like reduced outflow during winter due to low snowfall and increased outflow during spring despite minimal or no rain, both of which are physical occurrences. Three machine learning models (SVM, RF, LGBM) and two deep learning models (LSTM, TCN) were built by combining rainfall and inflow series. With optimal hyperparameter tuning, the appropriate model was selected, resulting in a high level of predictive performance with NSE ranging from 0.842 to 0.894. Moreover, to generate rainfall correction data considering snow accumulation, a simulated snow accumulation algorithm was developed. Applying this correction to machine learning and deep learning models yielded NSE values ranging from 0.841 to 0.896, indicating a similarly high level of predictive performance compared to the pre-snow accumulation application. Notably, during the snow accumulation period, adjusting rainfall during the training phase was observed to lead to a more accurate simulation of observed inflow when predicted. This underscores the importance of thoughtful data preprocessing, taking into account physical factors such as snowfall and snowmelt, in constructing data models."

Leveraging a dataset comprising 93 macroeconomic and financial variables spanning from August 2004 to June 2023, we employ various machine learning methods, including XGBoost and LSTM. While month-on-month inflation rates exhibit lower persistence, year-on-year rates demonstrate high persistence. Machine learning methods notably enhance month-on-month inflation forecasting accuracy. However, for year-on-year inflation forecasting, these methods perform less favorably compared to the random walk model. This underscores the necessity of caution when applying machine learning to highly persistent time series. Interestingly, converting month-on-month forecasts into year-on-year predictions yields reduced forecast losses and, in some cases, significantly outperforms the random walk model. Our results offer valuable insights for practitioners and policymakers seeking to leverage machine learning for inflation forecasting, emphasizing the nuanced impact of time series persistence on forecasting effectiveness."

However, most methods proposed in previous research have shown low accuracy or limitations in scalability. Additionally, there is limited research on the use of machine learning algorithms with excellent predictive performance for product performance prediction through online review analysis, and there is insufficient empirical research applying explainable machine learning techniques in the context of online review analysis. Therefore, this study proposes a framework that extracts a product attribute system from online review text reflecting product attributes based on natural language processing technology and predicts and explains performance through machine learning models. To validate the framework, 'running shoes' products and online reviews were collected from Coupang and the product's attributes were measured using Word2Vec, and the attribute hierarchy was classified through hierarchical clustering. Using review attributes and main keywords, product attributes and sentiment scores were predicted at the sentence level using LSTM, and scores for each top attribute were calculated for each product. The relationship between product attribute scores and product performance (i.e., overall satisfaction [rating], popularity [number of online reviews]) was learned as a predictive model, and the importance of product attributes and the relationship between product attributes and product performance were analyzed at the entire product group level. This study provides theoretical and practical implications by proposing a framework that can obtain implications for product improvement and new product development by analyzing online reviews with natural language processing technology and machine learning algorithms."

Compared with the verification dataset, the overall performance of the models indicated that the Random Forest(RF) showed the highest accuracy. The highest performance of the Random Forest(RF) model can be explained by its ability to combine multiple decision trees for a final prediction. Furthermore, the performance based on wildfire severity showed that all machine learning algorithm models had lower detection performance in heat damage areas compared with crown and surface fire areas. Crown and heat damage areas have similar spectral reflectance patterns, and heat damage and surface fire areas are considered to have shown lower performance due to the complex canopy structure. Machine learning based burn severity estimation provide critical baselines for rapid recovery planning and greenhouse gas emissions calculations."

A total of 195 datasets, including 94 experimental data and 101 literature data, were analyzed to evaluate correlations among LH, P-wave velocity (VP), dry density (Density), and UCS. The analysis of the relationship between LH and UCS showed variable correlations by rock type, with igneous rocks showing the highest correlation (R2 = 0.74) and metamorphic rocks showing the lowest (R2 = 0.12). In comparing prediction methods, machine learning models significantly outperformed both linear (R2 = 0.626) and non-linear regression (R2 = 0.644) approaches. Among various machine learning models tested, XGBoost demonstrated the highest performance (R2 = 0.902, RMSE = 16.282), particularly  when combining  multiple  variables  (LH,  VP,  Density,  Rock type).

It outlines and proposes theories and algorithms for predicting the strokes of articulation jacks used in a shield TBM and calculating the three-dimensional path coordinates of the shield TBM based on these predictions. To predict the strokes of articulation jacks, two methods were applied: a machine learning model based on the random forest regressor, and an iterative calculation method to satisfy a preset allowable error. For the iterative calculation, optimization methods were applied to reduce computation time. The mean and variance of the relative errors from the iterative calculation with allowable error were found to be relatively smaller than the predictions of the machine learning model. However, even with optimization methods applied, the iterative calculation method  showed  limitations  in  the  allowable  error  that  could  be  applied  in  terms  of computation time. Therefore, it would be better to apply the machine learning model when real-time calculation speed is crucial. On the other hand, when pre-calculated results can be used during construction, the iterative calculation can be applied to achieve higher accuracy."

Effective nutrient runoff management is crucial for sustainable agriculture and ecosystem protection. This study proposes a new methodology for nutrient management by evaluating the predictability of nutrient runoff loads under various best management practices (BMPs) scenarios using a machine learning model. The Agricultural Policy and Environmental Extender (APEX) model was employed to simulate the effectiveness of BMPs in reducing nutrient runoff across farmlands within riparian and drinking water protection zones. Additionally, the predictability of nutrient runoff reduction was assessed using six machine learning models, with the best model selected based on cross-validation performance. Results indicate that the filter strip scenario within the APEX model was the most effective, achieving a nutrient runoff reduction efficiency of 61.6%. Xtreme Gradient Boosting demonstrated superior predictive performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.75, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.65, total nitrogen (T-N) and an R2 of 0.55 and NSE of 0.48 for total phosphorus. These findings suggest that nutrient runoff reduction can be effectively evaluated using topographical and meteorological data alone. This study provides a methodological framework for predicting nutrient runoff loads and assessing the impacts of BMPs in agricultural watersheds."

In particular, the properties of the data used to train machine learning models change over time, causing the model to become less accurate or behave differently than it was designed to. This phenomenon is called drift. Drift can occur for a variety of reasons, including data collection issues or market volatility. Data drift is difficult to detect immediately and can lead to inaccurate predictions, compromising business decisions based on it. The actions required to manage drift will depend on the type, extent, and nature of the drift. To take appropriate action, it is important to establish repeatable procedures for identifying drift, controlling and assessing data quality, setting thresholds for drift rates, and configuring proactive warnings. In this paper, we propose a two-step data quality assessment framework that can manage drift problems that occur in machine learning projects through data quality assessment indicators. In addition, evaluation indices and evaluation procedures according to drift type for drift detection are also defined."

In non-cooperative contexts, since a receiver does not know communication parameters used by a transmitter, it has to estimate the communication parameters from a received data without any prior knowledge about the parameters to recover information from the received data. Specifically, it becomes more challenging under the condition of scant received data. Recently, estimation of interleaver parameter from scant received data has been researched. However, this method requires additional computational complexity in order to achieve an improved estimation performance.

To bridge the gap in the field of SMEs default prediction research, this study aims to evaluate the accuracy of ML for predicting loan defaults of startups. To this end, we compares which ML model is most accurate for predicting loan defaults of domestic startups and established companies, and how its performance differs from statistical models. The main findings from the empirical results are summarized as follows: Firstly, AdaBoost has been evaluated as highly accurate and stable for predicting short- to long-term (1 to 3 years) loan defaults in startups, while support vector machines showed good performance for 1-year predictions in established company. Secondly, the accuracy of loan default prediction for startups using statistical models, such as the logistic regression, was found to be nearly equivalent to that of ML. However, there were ML techniques that performed worse than statistical models. Thirdly, financial features provide significant explanatory power in predicting loan defaults of startups. Debt capacity ratio and liquidity ratios were effective for both short- and long-term loan default predictions in startups and established businesses. The analysis suggests that while machine learning significantly improves the accuracy of predicting loan default for SMEs, it has the drawback of lower interpretability of predictive variables. Therefore, its usefulness varies depending on the purpose of use. This paper contributes by evaluating the usefulness of multiple ML and the effectiveness of financial features for predicting the loan default of startups through an intertemporal validation method."

TPOT, which utilizes genetic algorithms to automate the generation of optimal machine learning pipelines, was used to build models. Additionally, Random Forest (RF) was implemented as a benchmark to evaluate TPOT’s applicability. Predictions were generated with lead times of 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours, and model accuracy was evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and root-mean-square error (RMSE).Results and Discussion:The predictions from both TPOT and RF showed high accuracy for shorter lead times, with NSE values exceeding 0.99 for the 1-hour predictions. However, predictive accuracy decreased as lead time increased, likely due to greater uncertainty in rainfall forecast data, particularly for the 12-hour predictions.

Despite substantial investments by the South Korean government, effective solutions remain elusive. This study employs machine learning techniques to develop an urban decline prediction model centered on population change rates, a critical indicator of urban decline. Among the models tested, Gradient Boosting achieved the highest performance with a Recall value of 0.92. The analysis identified three primary drivers of population loss and urban decline: employment and industry-related factors such as the proportion of manufacturing employment, housing and residential environment conditions, and social welfare-related variables. Manufacturing was found to play a pivotal role in predicting urban decline, yet its influence has been underexplored in prior research. Rather than solely focusing on fertility rates and birth incentives, this study highlights the importance of industrial restructuring, improved housing conditions, and raising social awareness to promote urban regeneration. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers to efficiently allocate resources and implement effective urban revitalization initiatives."

Regression models for the copper loss are determined using the simulation results and the machine learning technique. From the regression model, optimal high-frequency transformer designs and Pareto front(in terms of transformer 2-dimensional area and loss) are obtained using NSGA-II.

By developing a container-based real-time data collection automation system that reflects the specificity of idol data, we secure the stability and scalability of idol data collection and compare and analyze the clusters of successful idols through a K-Means clustering-based outlier detection model.As a result, we were able to identify commonalities among successful idols such as gender, time of success after album release, and association with new media. Through this, it is expected that we can finally plan optimal comeback promotions for each idol, album type, and comeback period to improve the chances of idol success."

Individuals or corprate businesses may have less access to sensitive information than large distribution companies, making it difficult to select an effective location. Accordingly, this study proposed a model that can predict sales of new super stores using easily accessible commercial district information. At this time, the model applied the broken-line regression method to dived the analysis object into two areas before/after the break-point, and separately estimated sales by fitting ridge regression to each area. Through this, it is expected that it will be possible to identify various relationships between sales and influencing factors.As a result of the analysis, a clear difference in relationship between the two areas appeared starting from the break-point, and the sales prediction accuracy through the regression model was also found to be at a good level."

Data from 8,394 forests sold via ONBID from 2016 to 2023 were analyzed, including property details, bid information, and economic indicators like population, taxes, and land price changes. PCA and MLR were used to identify key independent variables, and DT, RF, SVR, and XGB algorithms were employed to improve winning bid price accuracy. MAE and MAPE assessed prediction performance. Key factors increasing winning bid prices include the previous year’s land price change rate, number of inquiries, number of creditors requesting distribution, initial bid price, final bid price, and land size. Factors decreasing winning bid prices are whether a property is landlocked, whether the appraisal report contains the word “impossible,” the previous year’s local income tax in the area where the land is located, and whether the property is sold as partial ownership. Initially, the previous year’s land price change rate increased winning bid prices but decreased as the auction progressed. SVR demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy, followed by MLR, DT, RF, and XGB. Hyperparameter optimization enhanced predictive accuracy, particularly challenging for first-round bids. MAPE improved to 4.17% from the second to the sixth rounds. This study effectively predicts winning bid prices with high accuracy, would apply to auctions and real estate, and be valuable for general land price evaluations."

In this research, through digital soil mapping to predict the spatial distribution of forest soil properties, we developed digital soil maps of forest soil pH across South Korea. Upon employing various machine learning methods, the random forest algorithm emerged as the most accurate. Key environmental factors influencing the distribution of forest soil pH were identified, including geographic, topographic, and parent material variables. The spatial distribution of forest soil pH revealed higher pH values in areas with alkaline bedrock (limestone and basalt) and lower pH values in areas dominated by gneiss parent material. Notably, highly acidic soils (pH < 4.5) were found in the metropolitan area, southwestern Chungcheong region, and the southern coast. Strongly acidic soil can negatively affect vegetation growth environment and carbon sequestration capacity, so anthropogenic factors that accelerate acidification should be reduced and continuously managed through periodic monitoring."

In this study, a model to predict TOC was developed using XGBoost (XGB), a representative ensemble machine learning algorithm. Independent variables for model construction included water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration, BOD, COD, suspended solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and discharge. To quantitatively analyze the impact of various water quality parameters used in model construction, the feature importance of input variables was calculated. Based on the results of feature importance analysis, items with low importance were sequentially excluded to observe changes in model performance. When built by sequentially excluding items with low importance, the performance of the model showed a root mean squared error-observation standard deviation ratio (RSR) range of 0.53 to 0.55.

Quantitative analysis of color in urban environments is a complex process that has been difficult to implement in the past. However, with recent rapid advances in Machine Learning, it has become possible to analyze city colors using photos shared by tourists. This study selected Dali City, a popular tourist destination in China, as a case study. Photos of Dali City shared by tourists were collected, and a method to measure large-scale city colors was explored by combining machine learning techniques. Specifically, the DeepLabv3+ model was first applied to perform a semantic segmentation of tourist sharing photos based on the ADE20k dataset, thereby separating artificial elements in the photos. Next, the K-means clustering algorithm was used to extract colors from the artificial elements in Dali City, and an adjacency matrix was constructed to analyze the correlations between the dominant colors. The research results indicate that the main color of the artificial elements in Dali City has the highest percentage of orange-grey. Furthermore, gray tones are often used in combination with other colors. The results indicated that local ethnic and Buddhist cultures influence the color characteristics of artificial elements in Dali City.

Data from the ‘2020 Graduates Occupational Mobility Survey’ (2019GOMS) conducted by the Korea Employment Information Service (KEIS) was utilized, analyzing 4,018 four-year university graduates aged 34 or younger. To predict initial wages and identify key influencing factors, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting techniques were employed. The university and workplace locations were categorized into four types: ‘metropolitan-metropolitan’, ‘metropolitan-provincial’, ‘provincial-metropolitan’, and ‘provincial-provincial’. The analysis revealed that these location combinations significantly influence initial wages. Notably, the ‘metropolitan-metropolitan’ and ‘metropolitan-provincial’ types showed higher initial wages, while the ‘provincial-provincial’ type was the lowest. These results suggest that the hierarchical structure among universities and the concentration of resources in the metropolitan area are exacerbating wage disparities. Furthermore, job characteristics - such as organization size and regular employment status - were found to have a greater impact on initial wages than individual factors like human capital. Major, GPA, and university satisfaction were also identified as important variables, with their effects varying by gender. This study provides new insights into regional imbalances and gender differences in the youth labor market through machine learning techniques, and presents policy implications for improving the work environment of provincial university graduates.

Our primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative information in predicting the delinquency of loan applicants. This assessment involved comparative analyses between scores generated from alternative data sources and credit scores established by credit bureaus.This study has explored the largest number of alternative information sources among domestic empirical studies. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on the usefulness of alternative information as a complementary factor to credit information, this study has demonstrated that alternative information alone can also provide excellent performance when a diverse range of alternative information is used.The model we developed produced an alternative score with higher predictive power, achieving an AUC of 87%, compared to the standard credit scores from credit bureaus, which had AUCs of 84% and 82% respectively. This demonstrates that the alternative score not only outperforms standard credit scores but also exhibits a high level of robustness.A key finding of our research is that by utilizing a sufficient amount of alternative data, it is possible to achieve higher predictive accuracy than standard credit scores, even without relying on demographic variables. This enables a fairer evaluation of loan applicants, particularly for financially marginalized groups such as non-salaried workers and younger individuals who lack traditional credit histories.Furthermore, contrary to concerns that the utilization of alternative data in credit scoring may exacerbate social stratification, this study demonstrates that alternative data can provide significant benefits to those who have been disadvantaged by the traditional credit scoring system, which has primarily focused on salaried individuals and may have led to conservative evaluations for other groups. This suggests that alternative data not only enhances the accuracy of credit evaluations but also increases financial inclusion.Additionally, our research underscores the importance of adhering to data privacy regulations when utilizing alternative information, as the use of alternative data becomes more prevalent in credit scoring.Overall, this study highlights the potential of alternative data to improve the credit scoring system by enhancing accuracy and inclusivity. The findings suggest that integrating alternative information into credit evaluation models can provide considerable benefits, both in terms of predictive performance and in promoting financial inclusion for underserved populations, especially thin-filers."

We examined various variables -including job satisfaction, family life satisfaction, health satisfaction, and environmental satisfaction- to identify both linear and nonlinear relationships affecting happiness within complex contexts. Notably, the findings reveal that feelings of alienation experienced during SNS (Social Network Service) use negatively impact happiness, and that interpersonal trust is a key factor in mitigating this adverse effect. By performing individual-level predictions, we confirmed that the influence of the same variables on happiness can vary based on individual characteristics and contexts. These results suggest that policy efforts are needed to alleviate feelings of alienation from SNS use and to enhance interpersonal trust to improve personal happiness. The significance of this study lies in its precise and detailed discussion of the factors affecting the happiness of Koreans through machine learning."

However, in Korea, the designflood level for coastal areas typically relies on the average water level according to the tide, ignoring this interaction. This studyaimed to address this gap by developing a machine learning-based compound flood level model that incorporates the interactionsbetween rainfall and tides. It also evaluated the adequacy of the design water level in the Taehwa River basin, a representativetidal river. Before developing the model, Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) was used to identify the components of the compoundflood level. The DWT results indicated that the compound flood level comprised three elements: rainfall-runoff, tides, and noise.A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was then created using these elements as input to estimate the compound flood levelfor a 200-year frequency, which is the design frequency of the Taehwa River. The compound flood level calculated by the modelwas 6.15 m, which is higher than the established design flood level of the Taehwa river (5.79 m). This discrepancy indicates thatthe current flood measurements for the Taehwa River are inadequate in accounting for compound flooding. Based on these findings,we recommend incorporating the compound flood concept when calculating the design water levels in coastal areas."

The lithium-ion battery performance degradation model is an equivalent circuit-based model, but it reflects various electrochemical phenomena, including side reactions on the surface of the anode active material, including the formationof a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, the loss of positive electrode active material due to mechanical stress-induced fatigue failure is included, and the corresponding decrease in the amount of cyclable lithium.

The developed performance degradation model and parameter estimation method were verified based on actual experimental data. Since it is impossible to observe the inside of the battery, correct answers to the battery parameters cannot be obtained, so the model and parameter estimation algorithm are indirectly verified through errors of voltage and temperature. As a result of the verification, the errors in voltage and temperature were found to be 0.676% and 0.207%, respectively."

Unsupervised machine learning techniques can be a new approach to deriving important crash risk indicators. This paper applies a multi-stage methodology using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques systematically to evaluate crash risks. The proposed multi-stage methodology is composed of three stages. In the first stage, select variables that can classify risky and general traffic flow well using K-means clustering and Random forest. The second stage is the combination of variables that were derived in the first stage to construct important variable sets for detecting crash precursors. Lastly, third stage, crash prediction models with variable sets, which are selected from the second step, were developed using the support vector machine method. For the real-time crash prediction model, individual vehicle trajectory data were collected from commercial vehicles and used. As a result of this study, the multi-stage models that include variable selection through a combination of K-means clustering and Random Forest methods improved the predictive performance. This study proposes a new approach to selecting important variables that cannot be found by supervised learning when developing a crash prediction model. It is expected that more crashes can be prevented by performing proactive traffic safety management using the methodology suggested in this study."

Of 334 servers in operation for the game service, 29 logs were utilized, and the simultaneous connection drop was utilized. We loaded the first years metric log, which had one billion records, to the cloud. Due to the low frequency of failures, we extracted data from one to three hours before, and from one to three days before, the failure time to generate the dataset. The proposed model uses classification algorithms for machine learning, and performs the best on date-based datasets. The decision tree algorithm and random forest showed predictive performances of more 0.98. When applying machine learning with four metrics and two servers selected, both the decision tree algorithm and random forest performed at 1.0 with zero undetected errors. Unlike past studies, after selecting 126 metrics programmatically, we found higher performance from unexpected metrics. By leveraging these metrics, we could achieve high predictive performance regardless of the number of servers. Findings show that data extraction at a certain point in time is useful for failure prediction, and identifying the importance of metrics through a programmatic approach after machine learning is effective for building predictive models."

It is critical to achieve reliable protection of the power generation system in harsh environments. The single signal makes it diffi cult to identify the initial fault accurately due to the little impact by a small-turn short-circuit on the electromagnetic fi eld. Thus, this paper proposes a novel framework for multi-source information fusion fault diagnosis in VFRMs by extracted current signals manually and vibration signals automatically. Firstly, the armature winding short-circuit fault characteristics of the current and vibration signals in the VFRM are analyzed. Secondly, a multi-source fusion framework based on a kernel extreme learning machine combined with a multiscale convolutional neural network is presented according to the structural characteristics of the VFRM. Then, the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is applied for achieving decision-level fusion. Finally, a four-phase 8/10-pole VFRM prototype with diff erent AWSC faults is used to validate the proposed method. The results indicate that the fault diagnosis rate of the proposed method is 97.28%, which is 10.37% and 3.7% higher than vibration and current signals, respectively. It is more reliable and eff ective to identify diff erent AWSC faults accurately in the early stages."

However, the aging infrastructure continues to cause issues such as pipe failures and water quality concerns, creating operational difficulties. To solve these issues, performance assessments are used to quantitatively evaluate the system conditions and ensure effective maintenance. In Korea, these assessments are based on a scoring system that combines direct and indirect assessments. However, direct assessment of all pipes is limited by cost and time constraints. To address this issue, a deep neural network is used to assess the aging of water distribution systems. This study develops a framework to estimate direct results from indirect data by analyzing the correlation between indirect and direct assessments. Additionally, data augmentation is considered to compensate for the lack of training data in direct assessments, improve the reliability of performance assessments, and support better prioritization in system maintenance."

Key factors such as age, clinical features, and lifestyle choices were examined to assess their impact on BAG and the overall neurobiological health of individuals with MDD.Results  The findings indicate that MDD patients frequently experience accelerated brain aging, particularly in elderly populations, with BAG serving as a valuable biomarker for assessing biological aging rates. The review highlights the urgent need for more granular approaches, considering variables such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Specific local brain aging patterns were observed in regions related to emotional regulation, suggesting that localized BAG changes may provide critical insights into the pathophysiology of MDD and its neurobiological underpinnings.Conclusions BAG is a significant biomarker for evaluating accelerated brain aging in MDD, informing personalized treatment strategies. Future research should incorporate diverse clinical characteristics and advanced neuroimaging techniques in representative samples to enhance the clinical applicability of BAG and deepen the understanding of its role in depression and biological aging."

We evaluated the coverage performance of the analyzed machine learning-based fuzzers against real-world programs with four different file formats and bug detection performance against the LAVA-M dataset. The results showed that AFL-HIER, which applied seed clustering and seed scheduling with reinforcement learning outperformed in coverage and bug detection. In the case of supervised learning, it showed high coverage on tcpdumps with high code complexity, and its superior bug detection performance when applied to hybrid fuzzing.

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based architecture (BFLSID) to support federated learning and improve intrusion detection in IoT networks. We have also developed a distributed storage system that integrates InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Hyperledger Fabric to ensure the security of model training and detection results."

The AHRS provides orientation by processing signals from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer. Numerous rule-based filtering algorithms have been developed to estimate orientation based on IMU signals. However, several studies have recently been conducted to develop machine-learning-based algorithms. In this study, the methodology and estimation performance of IMU-based orientation estimation algorithms were reviewed by using rule-based filtering and machine learning approaches. A total of 37 papers were selected after searching the databases of IEEE Xplore, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Rule-based filtering algorithms were divided into Kalman and complementary filters depending on the weight calculation process. Approaches were also categorized into the direct estimation of the orientation and the correction of the error terms in the orientation or angular velocity. The machine learning algorithms were divided into the following: a combined method that estimated or corrected orientation by combining machine learning model with a rule-based filtering algorithm; and an end-to-end method that directly estimated orientation through the model. Results showed that although the machine learning algorithms could reliably perform attitude estimation, the rule-based filtering algorithms still demonstrated superior performance in the estimation of 3D orientation, including attitude and heading."

Predicting the safety performance of these structures with time characteristics is an effective strategy for maintenance planning and can  appropriately pre-determine the duration and cost for their safety performance. This research predicts the safety grade of domestic road facilities including bridges, tunnels, and retaining walls. A database for each facility type was constructed to perform the safety performance evaluations, detailed safety inspections, and precision safety diagnostics. Ordinary bridges, NATM tunnels, and reinforced concrete retaining walls were selected since they are the most common structural types in the database. The safety grade prediction model was developed based on machine learning techniques considering the service life of the structures. Three regression-based machine learning algorithms were used to develop an optimal prediction model: decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).

In this paper, we present the development of a cloud monitoring program by applying a machine learning-based Python module ""cloudynight"" on all-sky camera images obtained at Miryang Arirang Astronomical Observatory (MAAO). The machine learning model was built by training 39,996 subregions divided from 1,212 images with altitude/azimuth angles and extracting 16 feature spaces. For our training model, the F1-score from the validation samples was 0.97, indicating good performance in identifying clouds in the all-sky image. As a result, this program calculates ""Cloudiness"" as the ratio of the number of total subregions to the number of subregions predicted to be covered by clouds. In the robotic observation, we set a policy that allows the telescope system to halt the observation when the ""Cloudiness"" exceeds 0.6 during the last 30 minutes. Following this policy, we found that there were no improper halts in the telescope system due to incorrect program decisions. We expect that robotic observation with the 0.7 m telescope at MAAO can be successfully operated using the cloud monitoring program."

Specifically, the study utilized text classification algorithms, including Multinomial Naive Bayes and ensemble methods (Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting), to train models on strategic and issue frames within news data. These models were then applied to classify news articles reporting on the 20th South Korean presidential election. The results indicated that the Multinomial Naive Bayes model exhibited superior performance, and approximately two-thirds of the analyzed articles were categorized under the strategic frame. The proposed election education plan takes into account the elements of media literacy, such as access, analysis, evaluation, and creation. It includes election news exploration through media, election news frame analysis, news frame classification and evaluation using artificial intelligence machine learning, and election news writing based on issue frames."

This study aims to derive a market diversification system by analyzing the cluster classification and industry specialization of the market through the pre- and post-COVID-19 sales of alley markets in subway station areas. Based on the flow of sales, the study classified commercial districts into four types: active, recovering, maintaining, and declining. Through the analysis of the LQ index, we found that the more specialized the market, the more it declines and is disadvantaged by the post-COVID-19 agglomeration economy. Furthermore, the diversification index, a machine learning-based diversification system, was established in order to build a resilient market district by deriving the recommended industries for each market. The findings can be used as a basis for providing diversification strategies and as a method for constructing resilient alley markets to promote connectivity between industries in social disaster situations."

The most typical GA system is the optical marker tracking system (OMC), but it has several drawbacks, and thus more recently, machine learning-based markerless motion capture technologies have been introduced with automatic skeleton tracking algorithms. For ensuring the practical application of the MMC method in the gait analysis, the accuracy of estimated joint positions needs to be verified. To quantify the accuracy of MMC pose estimation at a gait, scatters of keypoint positions from the Mediapipe pose estimation become the noise while the knee joint angle was chosen as a representative signal. Also, using one of these markerless gait analysis systems, a quantitative validation has been performed. The variance of the key points measured while walking was quantified as noise, and the knee joint angles were compared between the case where noise was assumed to occur at the maximum and the normal case. The validation process focused on three lower extremity joint angles and compared with two other motion capture methods, i.e., with optical maker and inertia sensor. The knee joint gait angle showed the best correlation (0.92 mean CORA score) while the worst correlation (0.47 mean CORA score) was obtained."

This study proposes a novel approach that detects elliptical shapes and approximates arbitrary objects as ellipses for detection. Using this methodology, the edges of an image are first extracted, a fundamental step in object detection, by dividing the image into small patches for generating machine learning data. The edge extraction process uses random forest machine learning, which provides robustness and efficiency in capturing edge features. Subsequently, object outlines are classified using density-based clustering techniques, enabling the identification of potential objects within the image. These identified objects are subsequently formulated as ellipse candidates using the five-dimensional parametric conic equation of an ellipse for each set of points. Multiple ellipses are generated via least squares ellipse fitting, ensuring a comprehensive representation of object shapes within the image. Finally, rigorous verification processes are employed to select the most suitable ellipse candidates as detection items.

Thus, it is essential to investigate the variables that predict depression in this age group. Both personal and environmental factors influence depression of middle school students, which necessitates a holistic analysis with large-scale data. Particularly, the Korean Children and Youth Panel 2018 (KCYPS 2018) was utilized to predict depression in middle school students with machine learning techniques: group Mnet and random forest. After comparison of prediction performance, group Mnet was selected as the final technique, identifying 42 predictors out of 305 explanatory variables. Variables consistent with previous research included self-esteem, emotional problems, physical symptoms, grit, cyber-delinquency experience, subjective health status, the degree of happiness, relationships with friends, and parenting style. In contrast, some variables measuring academic lethargy and cooperativeness were not consistent with previous findings. This study also identified six new variables that contribute to depression prediction. Specifically, a career choice factor, time spent watching TV on weekends, and presence of favorite celebrity or athlete were negative predictors of depression, while pretentious characteristics, time spent with parents on weekends, and reading from smartphones were positive predictors. Further investigation into the newly identified variables or those inconsistent with previous studies will enhance the student mental health support system and, consequently, improve the quality of life of students."

The existence of spatial heterogeneity often violates the assumption that sub-study areas have the same population, necessitating the creation of local machine learning models. Subway ridership also exhibits spatial heterogeneity, and creating local models based on the composition of spatially similar regions could improve prediction accuracies. This study explores the impact of spatially constrained hierarchical clustering on the prediction accuracy of machine learning models. Specifically, the prediction accuracies are compared between models created for each cluster and the entire model by varying the number of clusters. Subway ridership is utilized as the response variable, and the machine learning techniques employed are linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting. The results indicate that as the number of clusters increases, the prediction accuracy of the cluster model tends to exceed that of the entire model across most techniques.

Because nuclear power plant structure are usually constructed by material of reinforced concrete, the aging deterioration of R.C. have no small effect on structural behavior of nuclear power plant structure. Therefore, aging deterioration of R.C. nuclear power plant structure should be considered for exact prediction of seismic responses of the structure. In this study, a machine learning model for seismic response prediction of nuclear power plant structure was developed by considering aging deterioration. The OPR-1000 was selected as an example structure for numerical simulation. The OPR-1000 was originally designated as the Korean Standard Nuclear Power Plant (KSNP), and was re-designated as the OPR-1000 in 2005 for foreign sales. 500 artificial ground motions were generated based on site characteristics of Korea. Elastic modulus, damping ratio, poisson’s ratio and density were selected to consider material property variation due to aging deterioration.

Although polygraph examination is most common in criminal procedure, but it has little admissibility of evidence due to the weakness of scientific basis. In 1990s to support the weakness of scientific basis about polygraph, Farwell and Donchin proposed the P300-based concealed information test technique. The P300-based concealed information test has two strong points. First, the P300-based concealed information test is easy to conduct with polygraph. Second, the P300-based concealed information test has plentiful scientific basis. Nevertheless, the utilization of P300-based concealed information test is infrequent, because of the quantity of probe stimulus. The probe stimulus  contains closed information that is relevant to the crime or other investigated situation. In tradition P300-based concealed information test protocol, three or more probe stimuli are necessarily needed. But it is hard to acquire three or more probe stimuli, because most of the crime relevant information is opened in investigative situation. In addition, P300-based concealed information test uses oddball paradigm, and oddball paradigm makes imbalance between the number of probe and irrelevant stimulus. Thus, there is a possibility that the unbalanced number of probe and irrelevant stimulus caused systematic underestimation of P300 amplitude of irrelevant stimuli. To overcome the these two limitation of P300-based concealed information test, one-probe P300-based concealed information test protocol is explored with various machine learning algorithms. According to this study, parameters of the modified one-probe protocol are as follows. In the condition of female and male face stimuli, the duration of stimuli are encouraged 400ms, the repetition of stimuli are encouraged 60 times, the analysis method of P300 amplitude is encouraged peak to peak method, the cut-off of guilty condition is encouraged 90% and the cut-off of innocent condition is encouraged 30%. In the condition of two-syllable word stimulus, the duration of stimulus is encouraged 300ms, the repetition of stimulus is encouraged 60 times, the analysis method of P300 amplitude is encouraged peak to peak method, the cut-off of guilty condition is encouraged 90% and the cut-off of innocent condition is encouraged 30%. It was also conformed that the logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), K Neighbors (KNN) algorithms were probable methods for analysis of P300 amplitude. The one-probe P300-based concealed information test with machine learning protocol is helpful to increase utilization of P300-based concealed information test, and supports to determine a person’s truthfulness and credibility with the polygraph examination in criminal procedure."

Through a systematic literature review, this study identified and selected 38 papers related to AI education. Keywords were then extracted based on the titles and summaries of these papers. A keyword frequency analysis was performed on the keywords, document frequencies, and indicator data using the machine learning TF-IDF method. A total of 49 core words were extracted by analyzing co-occurring words in the literature. To analyze the connection structure and strength among these related words, the relative centrality of words and documents was analyzed. This analysis verified the degree of relationship, and a cluster composed of words with similarities was derived through CONCOR analysis. According to the findings of the analysis, “education,” “ethics,” “generative,” “study,” and “development” emerged as the main keywords. Furthermore, in the N-GRAM network graph analysis, words such as “development,” “emphasis,” “education,” and “results” exhibited high relative frequency and centrality. These results indicate that research necessary for practical AI education can be conducted by analyzing and identifying trends in AI education research."

Statistical analyses were performed using Python 3.7.6.Results : In the training dataset, most models achieved high accuracy (0.986), with Bagging Classifier and Extra Trees Classifier demonstrating excellent performance (AUC 0.974). The test dataset also showed high accuracy (0.998) across models, but AUC scores varied. AdaBoost Classifier (AUC 0.812), Random Forest Classifier (AUC 0.786), and MLP Classifier (AUC 0.736) performed particularly well.Conclusion : This study employed machine learning techniques to classify cutaneous adverse reactions associated with second-generation (cefoxitin) and first-generation (cephalothin) cephalosporins, which have relatively high adverse event risks, and to predict potential cutaneous reactions in new cases. The models incorporated cross-reactivity possibilities based on cephalosporin chemical structures and demonstrated high predictive accuracy. These findings are expected to contribute to the development of safer antibiotic use guidelines based on scientific evidence."

Unfortunately, research on the characteristics of wave breaking and the prediction of the wave breaker index for gravel beaches has been limited. This study aims to forecast the wave breaker in dex for gravel beaches using representative linear-based machine learning techniques known for their high predic tive performance in regression or classification problems across various research fields. Initially, the applicability of existing empirical formulas for wave breaker indices to gravel seabeds was assessed. Various linear-based machine learning algorithms were then employed to build prediction models, aiming to overcome the limitations of existing empirical formulas in predicting wave breaker indices for gravel seabeds. Among the developed ma chine learning models, a new calculation formula for easily computable wave breaker indices based on the model was proposed, demonstrating high predictive performance for wave height and depth of wave breaking on gravel beaches. The study validated the predictive capabilities of the proposed wave breaker indices through hydraulic model experiments and compared them with existing empirical formulas. Despite its simplicity as a polynomial, the newly proposed empirical formula for wave breaking indices in this study exhibited exceptional predictive performance for gravel beaches."

Instrumental motivation, intrinsic motivation towards mathematics, self-efficacy in mathematics, and beliefs about intelligence were used as independent variables for prediction based on the data from the second grade of middle school and the first grade of high school. Logistic models, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) models, and Random Forest models were applied, and the optimal prediction model was sought by comprehensively considering various indicators. In the case of using the data from the second grade of middle school, the MLP model showed superior predictive power compared to other models. In the case of using the data from the first grade of high school, all models did not show good predictive power. The model based on the data from the second grade of middle school was deemed to have practical applicability. These results suggest that while the affective domain regarding mathematics is an important factor in the choice of a STEM major, more diverse variables and complex models are needed for predicting majors during high school years. Additionally, while recognizing the limitations of machine learning models, more theoretical discussions are needed on the relationship between major selection and the affective elements of mathematics, and it is hoped that various prediction models will be developed and used in actual practice."

Big data-based machine learning models (hereafter ML prediction models) have been acclaimed for making breakthrough advancements in various predictive tasks. However, considerable criticism exists regarding using these ML prediction models. Specifically, the fact that ML prediction models depend on correlation rather than causation raises the question of whether their predictions can be genuinely good. This paper will address this question by distinguishing prediction problems into two types. Predictions for decision-making can be divided into ‘predictions for prior intervention’ and ‘predictions for reactive intervention’. These two distinct types of predictions contribute to decision-making in different ways. For prior intervention, causal knowledge is strongly required for good predictions, whereas for reactive intervention, correlational knowledge alone can suffice for good predictions. Therefore, using ML prediction models based on correlations can constitute good prediction activities in the context of reactive interventions."

Analog data collected from these sensors was used in classification models for anomaly detection. Since the classification accuracy was around only 93%, commonly used hyperparameter optimization techniques such as Grid search, Random search, and Bayesian Optimization were applied to increase accuracy. In addition, Response Surface Method based on Design of Experiment was also used for hyperparameter optimization. However, it was found that there were limits to improving accuracy with these methods. The reason is that the sampling data from an analog signal does not reflect the patterns hidden in the signal. Therefore, in order to find pattern information of the sampling data, we obtained descriptive statistics such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and percentiles of the analog data, and applied them to the classification models.

This Blue-green algal bloom is expected to increase in intensity and frequency due to the increase in algae's residence time in the water body after the construction of the Nakdong River weir, as well as the increase in surface temperature due to climate change. In this study, in order to respond to the expected increase in green algae phenomenon, an algal bloom forecast system based on hydro-meteorological factors was presented for preemptive response before issuing a algal bloom warning. Through polyserial correlation analysis, the preceding influence periods of temperature and discharge according to the algal bloom forecast level were derived. Using the decision tree classification, a machine learning technique, Classification models for the algal bloom forecast levels based on temperature and discharge of the preceding period were derived. And a algal bloom forecast system based on hydro-meteorological factors was derived based on the results of the decision tree classification models. The proposed algae forecast system based on hydro-meteorological factors can be used as basic research for preemptive response before blue-green algal blooms."

However, research on the biological pump in this area is limited. We developed machine learning models to estimate net community production (NCP), a measure of biological pump, with high spatial and time scales of 4 km and 8 days, respectively. The models were fed with the input parameters of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, mixed layer depths, and photosynthetically active radiation and trained with observed NCP derived from high resolution measurements of surface O2/Ar. The root mean square error between the predicted values by the best performing machine model and the observed NCP was 6 mmol O2 m-2 d-1, corresponding to 15% of the average of observed NCP. The NCP in the central part of the Ulleung Basin was highest in March at 49 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 and lowest in June and July at 18 mmol O2 m-2 d-1. These seasonal variations were similar to the vertical nitrate flux based on the 3He gas exchange rate and to the particulate organic carbon flux estimated by the 234Th disequilibrium method. To expand this method, which produces NCP estimate for spring and summer, to autumn and winter, it is necessary to devise a way to correct bias in NCP by the entrainment of subsurface waters during the seasons."

However, the integrity of data analysis is compromised if data quality is not adequately ensured, potentially leading to biased interpretations. This is particularly critical for water level data, essential for water resource management, which often encounters quality issues such as missing values, spikes, and noise. This study addresses the challenge of noise-induced data quality deterioration, which complicates trend analysis and may produce anomalous outliers. To mitigate this issue, we propose a noise removal strategy employing Wavelet Transform, a technique renowned for its efficacy in signal processing and noise elimination. The advantage of Wavelet Transform lies in its operational efficiency - it reduces both time and costs as it obviates the need for acquiring the true values of collected data. This study conducted a comparative performance evaluation between our Wavelet Transform-based approach and the Denoising Autoencoder, a prominent machine learning method for noise reduction.. The findings demonstrate that the Coiflets wavelet function outperforms the Denoising Autoencoder across various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The superiority of the Coiflets function suggests that selecting an appropriate wavelet function tailored to the specific application environment can effectively address data quality issues caused by noise. This study underscores the potential of Wavelet Transform as a robust tool for enhancing the quality of water level data, thereby contributing to the reliability of water resource management decisions."

Especially, data processing for the model input and designing the model to solve the objective function are critical to achieve the model performance.

The hydrodynamic model for the downstream reach of the Han River was calibrated by considering the spatial distribution and temporal variation of Manning’s roughness coefficient in unsteady flow conditions. In the following error correction procedure, the systematic errors of the hydrodynamic model were captured using long short term memory (LSTM) model. To assess the model accuracy, performances of the hydrodynamic model, two LSTM based models (LSTM1 and LSTM2), and the hybrid model were compared. Regarding inputs, LSTM1 considers the historical observations only, and LSTM2 considers not only the historical observations that used in LSTM1 but also the prescribed boundary conditions required for the hydrodynamic forecast model. The root-mean-square errors were used for the evaluation of model performance. The hybrid model significantly improved the forecasting accuracy of flood water levels compared to individual models, which indicates that the hybrid model is able to take advantage of complementary strengths of both the hydrodynamic model and the LSTM model. The LSTM-based hybrid model also outperformed the hybrid model based on artificial neural network, resulting in less than 10 cm of root-mean-square error for 3-hour lead time forecasting of the flood water level."

From September 1 to September 8, 2023, we gathered 12,945 reviews for a total of 7,218 doctors from different specialties and hospital locations. By employing a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, we extracted variables from the collected social big data and estimated their effects.Results When considering the total rating as the dependent variable and controlling for factors such as doctors’ characteristics (experience, number of languages, specialties, detailed fields, number of certificates, treatment attitudes), hospital characteristics (number of insurance, waiting times, speed of treatment, employee kindness, number of ratings and reviews), and review content characteristics (number of words used in the review, sentiment of the review), it was found that dialogic communication had a positive impact on the total rating. Furthermore, it was noted that dialogic communication was particularly effective in cases where hospitals and doctors had less experience with negative evaluations related to treatment speed, treatment attitude, and employee kindness.Conclusions This study confirmed the effectiveness of organization-public dialogic communication in the realm of online information search and health communication. It employed the latest techniques and included the largest sample size to date, with a total of 13,000 participants. Additionally, the study unveiled the role of organization-public dialogic communication in influencing the decision-making process of medical consumers, based on the accessibility-diagnosis model. Furthermore, the study utilized machine learning methodology to develop an algorithm that can automatically determine whether reviews are related to organization-public dialogic communication, rather than relying on self-report data. These findings emphasize the importance of organization-public dialogic communication from the perspective of PR practitioners.

Most methods for estimating the number of victims rely on probabilistic functions and physical indicators, which are limited in their ability to reflect the nonlinear interactions among various variables discussed in the literature. To address these limitations, a random forest model that incorporates flood-related and characteristic variables and effectively captures these nonlinear interactions was developed. Additionally, a polynomial regression model was partially introduced to improve the accuracy of victim estimation in cases where the random forest model had not sufficiently learned from the data. The model was applied to Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea, as a case study area, and it predicted a high number of disaster victims in major flood-affected areas. The results confirmed that factors such as population, terrain, and building types—beyond just the flood area—contributed to these predictions.With the incorporation of additional data for model training and factors such as the distance to evacuation facilities in the future, this model is expected to become a crucial tool for urban planning and disaster management strategy development."

COVID-19 상황에서 관중 동원 비율이 관중 수에 어떤 영향을 주었는지 분석하여 지역별, 연도별, 방역 비율에 따라 관중 수 차이를 확인하였다. 연구 대상은 COVID-19 이전인 2018~2019시즌, COVID-19로 인해 영향을 받았던 2020~2021시즌과 COVID-19 이후인 2022년 시즌의 관중 수 자료를 수집하여 분석하였다. 도출된 연구 결과를 통한 주요 결론은 다음과 같다. 첫째, 지역 감염자 수가 증가할수록 관중 동원에 영향을 받았다는 점이다. 특히 수도권 지역에서는 비수도권 지역에 비해 COVID-19 감염자가 늘어날수록 관중 동원이 줄어들었음을 알 수 있었다. 둘째, 방역 수칙으로 인한 관중 동원 비율의 변화는 2020시즌에 의미 있는 차이가 있었지만, 2021시즌에는 동원 비율이 상승하여도 COVID-19 확산으로 인해 관중 증가는 나타나지 않았음을 볼 수 있었다. 셋째, 관중 수 변화 예측을 위해 최소제곱법(Ordinary Least Squares : OLS)과 XGBoost 모델을 사용하여 분석을 진행하였을 때, OLS 모델보다는 XGBoost가 더 좋은 성능을 보임을 확인할 수 있었고, 관중 수를 OLS 모델보다높은 정확도로 예측하였음을 알 수 있었다.","The purpose of this study is to focus on how the pandemic situation affected the change in the number of KBO spectators.By analyzing how the crowd mobilization ratio affected the number of spectators in the COVID-19 situation, the difference in the number of spectators was confirmed according to the region, year, and quarantine ratio. The subjects of this study collected and analyzed data on the number of spectators during the 2018-2019 season before COVID-19, the 2020-2021 season affected by COVID-19, and the 2022 season after COVID-19. The main conclusions from the derived research results are as follows. First, as the number of local infected people increased, the crowd mobilization was affected. In particular, in the metropolitan area, the number of spectators decreased as the number of COVID-19 infected increased compared to the non-metropolitan area. Second, the change in the crowd mobilization rate due to the quarantine rules had a significant difference in the 2020 season, but in the 2021 season, even if the mobilization rate increased, the increase in spectators did not appear due to the spread of COVID-19. Third, when the analysis was conducted using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and the XGBoost model to predict changes in the number of spectators, it was confirmed that XGBoost performed better than the OLS model, and it was found that the number of spectators was predicted with higher accuracy than the OLS model."

Text pre-processing, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based text summarization model were used. Manual categorization was added to supplement the unsupervised learning process. Seven topics were identified using LDA, from which five specific topics (‘side effects’, ‘treatment’, ‘army’, ‘interaction’, and ‘infectiousness’) were derived. Subsequently, manual classification was conducted based on these five topics. Manual summary and LSTM-based text summarization results were consistent. Numerous individuals sought information about the potential for curing latent tuberculosis and the risk of tuberculosis development. Moreover, questions related to the interpretation of test results and interactions with other substances were widespread. Concerning side effects, issues predominantly revolved around drug discontinuation due to skin problems and elevated liver function tests. The findings reveal the prevalent concerns and inquiries of society regarding latent tuberculosis. The identified topics offer valuable insights into the key aspects of interest related to this condition."

For the analysis, we applied explainable machine learning (XML) techniques, including random forest and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithms. The results showed that the top determinants predicting participation in traditional method-dependent learning for adult learners were perceived lifelong learning effectiveness, job-related goal orientation, learning orientation, lifelong learning accessibility, and age. In contrast, for online media-based learning, the top determinants predicting adult learners' participation were age, job-related goal orientation, learning orientation, perceived lifelong learning effectiveness, and educational level. Lastly, while the relationships between each predictor and participation in informal learning were generally positive, a deeper interpretation is required depending on the type and measurement method of each variable. These findings suggest that adult learners' participation in informal learning can be considered a reflection of their demographic factors, as well as their perceptions and expectations regarding lifelong learning.

Our study addresses this challenge by proposing an on-device AI-based real-time machine fault diagnosis system that utilizes continual learning. Our proposed system includes a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a continual learning algorithm, and a real-time monitoring service. First, we developed a lightweight 1D CNN model to reduce the cost of model deployment and enable real-time inference on the target edge device with limited computing resources. We then compared the performance of five continual learning algorithms with three public bearing fault datasets and selected the most effective algorithm for our system. Finally, we implemented a real-time monitoring service using an open-source data visualization framework. In the performance comparison results between continual learning algorithms, we found that the replay-based algorithms outperformed the regularization-based algorithms, and the experience replay (ER) algorithm had the best diagnostic accuracy. We further tuned the number and length of data samples used for a memory buffer of the ER algorithm to maximize its performance. We confirmed that the performance of the ER algorithm becomes higher when a longer data length is used. Consequently, the proposed system showed an accuracy of 98.7%, while only 16.5% of the previous data was stored in memory buffer. Our lightweight CNN model was also able to diagnose a fault type of one data sample within 3.76 ms on the Raspberry Pi 4B device."

Additionally, we intend to utilize the Q-learning algorithm, which possesses the characteristics of temporal difference (TD) learning, to automati- cally update and adapt to dynamic situations. This means that Q-learning can effectively consider dynamic environments by sensi- tively responding to changes in the state space and selecting optimal dispatching rules accordingly. The state space includes information such as inventory and work-in-process levels, order fulfilment status, and machine status, which are used to select the optimal dispatching rules. Furthermore, we aim to minimize total tardiness and the number of setup changes using reinforcement learning. Finally, we will develop a dynamic dispatching system using Q-learning and compare its performance with conventional static dispatching methods."

Next, we developed a multi-corpus text preprocessing algorithm to standardize the training data for machine learning. Additionally, we created a data script to generate Korean sign language animations, incorporating a code conversion process. This approach reduced labor-intensive preprocessing costs and enabled the conversion of sign language text into executable code with an average accuracy of 87.6%.

Traditional diagnostic methods for depression primarily rely on subjective assessments, including self-reported surveys and psychiatric consultations, which often lack objectivity and consistency. To address these limitations, this study developed a machine learning-based depression prediction model using ensemble learning techniques and applied SHAP to quantitatively analyze the contribution of individual features to model predictions. The study utilized real-world data collected over three years from 160 participants using smartwatches. To increase the size and diversity of dataset, a segmentation technique was applied resulting in 3,080 independent samples. The dataset included sleep metrics, heart rate, step count, and PHQ-9 survey results. Ensemble learning models were trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among these, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost achieved the highest accuracy of 99.50%. SHAP analysis identified key predictors of depression, with sleep metrics specifically variability in individual sleep duration and average night sleep duration emerging as the most significant contributors across all ensem- ble learning models. Specifically, night sleep duration, variability in overall sleep states, proportion of Deep sleep during night sleep, variability in REM sleep duration, and proportion of REM sleep during total daily sleep were found to be important features for detection MDD. Future work aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and robustness by expanding the datasets and feature variables, integrating advanced deep learning, and leveraging explainable AI with wearable device data to enable personalized, early detection and intervention for depression prevention and management."

To address this issue, this study proposes a noise reduction method that combines a Wave-U-Net-based deep learning model with a Wiener filter. Clean audio signals and various types of noise were synthesized to create a dataset consisting of clean signals (data1), signals with noise reduction applied (data2), and signals with an additional Wiener filter applied (data3). The dataset was generated at noise levels ranging from SNR 0 dB to 30 dB in 5 dB increments, and each model was trained using these datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed noise reduction method, the performance of Simple CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting), and SVM (Support Vector Machine) was measured on each dataset. Experimental results showed that noise reduction had a positive effect on performance in the SNR 0 dB to 5 dB range, but in environments with SNR levels above 10 dB, noise reduction led to performance degradation. This degradation is likely due to over-suppression of noise in lower-noise environments, which can distort the signal or result in unnecessary signal processing that harms the original signal quality. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of noise reduction in complex noise environments and highlights the need for further research to develop methods that maintain performance in higher SNR environments, particularly above 10 dB."

In particular, it is crucial for port safety management to consider not only incidents directly 'at-port' but also those in the surrounding 'near-port' areas, including the port influence area. This is significant because of the potential for high crash severity at near port areas, given the substantial truck traffic that could lead to large-scale crashes. Therefore, developing management strategies for port city safety requires identifying key risk factors that influence crash severity in each port area. During this process, because the key factors influencing crash severity may vary as one gets closer to the port center, it is essential to take into account the size of the port influence area. This study collected and matched both crash and weather data to consider various variables. Additionally, this study developed four machine learning-based crash severity models, including Naive Bayes Classification, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine.

However, some corrections deviated from the intended meaning, or introduced new errors during the correction process.Conclusions  This suggests that learners need education to consider various aspects beyond simply replacing awkward or incorrect expressions when recognizing and correcting errors. Furthermore, machine translation er-rors frequently necessitate more comprehensive revisions than merely addressing individual aspects.

Facial vitiligo, specifically affecting the face, significantly impacts patients' appear- ance, thereby diminishing their quality of life. Evaluating the efficacy of facial vitiligo treatment typically relies on subjective assessments, such as the Facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI), which can be time-consuming and subjective due to its reliance on clinical observations like lesion shape and distribution. Various machine learning and deep learning methods have been proposed for segmenting vitiligo areas in facial images, showing promising results. However, these methods often struggle to accurately segment vitiligo lesions irregularly distributed across the face. Therefore, our study introduces a framework aimed at improving the segmentation of vitiligo lesions on the face and providing an evaluation of vitiligo lesions. Our framework for facial vitiligo segmentation and lesion evaluation consists of three main steps. Firstly, we perform face detection to minimize background areas and identify the face area of interest using high-quality ultra- violet photographs. Secondly, we extract facial area masks and vitiligo lesion masks using a semantic segmentation net- work-based approach with the generated dataset. Thirdly, we automatically calculate the vitiligo area relative to the facial area. We evaluated the performance of facial and vitiligo lesion segmentation using an independent test dataset that was not included in the training and validation, showing excellent results. The framework proposed in this study can serve as a useful tool for evaluating the diagnosis and treatment efficacy of vitiligo."

While some universities utilize ChatGPT in education, concerns about information errors and limitations remain. As with the advent of machine translators, its use is inevitable and cannot be fully restricted. Therefore, the role of educators is to help students understand its characteristics, review processes and outputs, and encourage independent thinking and judgment. When new tools emerge, we must continually explore how to use them effectively within the relevant fields.This study examines the potential and limitations of using ChatGPT as an auxiliary tool for foreign language learning through practical application in dialogue tasks. For learners who lack immediate access to native speakers, ChatGPT offers a secondary method for practicing and experiencing conversations, providing some positive utility. Although this research is based on observations of a small group of participants and cannot be fully generalized, it offers insights into the specific characteristics of ChatGPT in language learning. Additionally, it explores learners’ responses and psychological changes in learning, proposing considerations for other educational contexts.To effectively use ChatGPT in language learning, it is crucial to set the learner’s proficiency level, define specific conversational contexts, and specify the desired response length. Many studies also emphasize the need to educate learners on prompt input methods. However, beyond basic settings, allowing students to explore and develop questioning skills on their own could be more effective in the long run. Encouraging learners to think independently and formulate better questions can itself be a valuable learning process.

연합 학습 환경에서의 랜덤 포레스트 알고리즘 최적화 전략 연구,2024,"['연합 학습', '랜덤 포레스트', '분산 환경', 'Federated Learning', 'Random Forest', 'Distributed Environment']",,"Federated learning has garnered attention as an efficient method for training machine learning models in a distributed environment while maintaining data privacy and security. This study proposes a novel FedRFBagging algorithm to optimize the performance of random forest models in such federated learning environments. By dynamically adjusting the trees of local random forest models based on client-specific data characteristics, the proposed approach reduces communication costs and achieves high prediction accuracy even in environments with numerous clients. This method adapts to various data conditions, significantly enhancing model stability and training speed. While random forest models consist of multiple decision trees, transmitting all trees to the server in a federated learning environment results in exponentially increasing communication overhead, making their use impractical. Additionally, differences in data distribution among clients can lead to quality imbalances in the trees. To address this, the FedRFBagging algorithm selects only the highest-performing trees from each client for transmission to the server, which then reselects trees based on impurity values to construct the optimal global model. This reduces communication overhead and maintains high prediction performance across diverse data distributions. Although the global model reflects data from various clients, the data characteristics of each client may differ. To compensate for this, clients further train additional trees on the global model to perform local optimizations tailored to their data. This improves the overall model’s prediction accuracy and adapts to changing data distributions. Our study demonstrates that the FedRFBagging algorithm effectively addresses the communication cost and performance issues associated with random forest models in federated learning environments, suggesting its applicability in such settings."

In the past, wave prediction was primarily based on numerical models grounded in physical principles; however, these methods require extensive computational resources. Recently, many researchers have applied machine learning methods to overcome these limitations. In this study, we utilized ensemble learning, a type of machine learning approach, to predict wave heights based on data collected from ocean observation stations in Korea. After determining the input variables of the model through correlation analysis, we applied and compared models using both bagging and boosting ensemble methods. The results indicated that, among the ensemble learning models, the boosting models outperformed the bagging models. This study is limited by its reliance on data from a single observation station. Therefore, future work will involve conducting research using data from multiple observation stations across various sea areas to validate the generalizability of the proposed model."

Students were asked to participate in a series of writing sessions, where they wrote English texts with the help of MT at their discretion. A variety of data were collected for qualitative analysis, including questionnaires, student texts, reflection journals, and interviews. It was found that students exhibited divergent strategies to take advantage of technological affordances. The main purpose of MT use by the more proficient student was to construct cohesion and coherence in writing and search for sophisticated vocabulary, whereas the other student used MT mainly for identifying and addressing her difficulties in terms of grammar and vocabulary. Despite their different purposes of MT use, both students took MT as a self-directed learning tool. These findings shed light on the educational potential of MT, which could be implemented in a writing classroom to assist not only English learners, but also instructors."

This study analyzed 426 sentences from MTs’ output in two ways: (1) whether the product accurately reflected the Korean cases and (ii) what types of errors were made. All the sentences were extracted from academic journal articles because they were meticulously crafted to include Korean case markers. The overall results demonstrated that two MTs could produce correct case markers in Korean to English sentences at high rates (around 95%). Still, they made errors such as ungrammatical sentences due to dropping the subject. The study implies that MTs hold significant promise as help in English writing classrooms."

Patients diagnosed with circadian sleep disorders, narcolepsy, or periodic limb movement disorders were excluded. From the actigraphy data, three types of data were selected from the first 5 days, namely, sleep-wake status, activity count, and light exposure per epoch. The data were processed into a two-dimensional array with four instances, namely, 24-hour full-day data and data for 6, 8, and 10 hours timepoints after sleep onset, and then analyzed. Using a CNN, we attempted to classify the processed data into PSG-based diagnoses.Results: Overfitting of the training data was observed. The CNN showed near-perfect accuracy on the test data, but failed to classify the validation data (area under the curve: 24-hour full-day data: 0.6031, 6 hours after sleep onset: 0.5148, 8 hours: 0.6122, and 10 hours: 0.5769).Conclusions: The lack and inaccuracy of data were responsible for the results. A higher sampling rate and additional ancillary data, such as PSG or heart rate variability data, are necessary for accurate classification. Additionally, alternative approaches to machine learning, such as transformers, should be considered in future studies."

The analyzed work is Kim Young-ha’s “The Empire of Light,” and the human translation is Xue Zhou’s “光之帝國”. There are 153 types of mimetic words in the original text, and the number of times they appear is 396. As a result of analyzing the translation situation of Korean mimetic words, Google Translate omitted the most cases without preserving the meaning of the original text, and also had the most translation errors. In contrast, Baidu omitted fewer words than human translators, and its translation results were also the most similar to human translation. Through this, we can infer that among the three types of machine translators, Google Translate has the least amount of data because deep learning has not progressed as much as the other two translators for Korean mimetic words, while Baidu Translate has the most data because deep learning has progressed the most."

Traditional Russian grammar classes are predominantly lecture-based. However, when learners are encouraged to explore linguistic phenomena using corpora, they can participate in the learning process as active researchers, as opposed to passive recipients of information. Moreover, with advancements in artificial intelligence and machine translation, students who major in foreign studies require not only foreign language proficiency but also the ability to analyze texts in that language. Therefore, examining the theoretical foundations of corpora and annotation systems as well as exploring their educational applications have become urgent tasks for these students.This study reviewed prior discussions on DDL as well as educational applications of the Russian National Corpus (RNC) in Russia. Based on the review’s findings, it proposed several discovery learning tasks that use the RNC in Russian language education. At the lexical/semantic level, tasks were designed to learn the concepts of synonyms and polysemy and to observe semantic changes in words. By contrast, at the morphological/syntactic level, tasks were proposed to analyze the parts of speech and syntactic functions of homonyms. Additionally, tasks were presented to analyze the various syntactic functions of infinitives using dependency trees. While this study primarily used the main corpus and the syntactic corpus of the RNC, future research should develop tasks that use other subcorpora within the RNC."

The idiomatic expressions related to 'Gan+predicate' were directly analyzed using the three translators, and the Chinese translations were classified into correctly translated sentences and mistranslated sentences. The study found that while all three translators had functionality for translating Korean idioms into Chinese, there were differences in their recognition and translation quality of idioms. Additionally, examples of common errors in the three translators were analyzed. The translation errors were broadly categorized into cases where the idiom was recognized but translated inappropriately into Chinese, and cases where the idiom was not recognized and was translated literally into Chinese. Through this analysis, the study highlights the lack of contextual understanding of idioms and the limitations of the idiom databases in the three translators, proposing that future translation tools utilize large-scale corpora to develop deep learning models and databases of idiomatic expressions that take into account the linguistic and cultural differences between Korea and China."

We decompiled 1,318 malware-infected files and 1,236 benign files provided by CIC-AndMal-2020. The decompiled files were very large and contained unnecessary code for training, requiring a preprocessing step to remove it. Training and evaluation results showed that RoBERTa achieved the highest evaluation accuracy. However, BERT exhibited higher training performance, and in prediction results for 451 benign and 597 malware files, BERT slightly outperformed RoBERTa. BART generally showed lower performance compared to BERT and RoBERTa. The differences in training, evaluation, and prediction results between BERT and RoBERTa seem to be due to the lack of diversity in the dataset and the absence of sophisticated preprocessing. Nevertheless, this experiment confirms that BERT and RoBERTa can both achieve significant performance in the field of malware detection. In future work, the proposed model is expected to achieve even better performance by improving the preprocessing steps."

However, due to time constraints for analyzing a large number of samples, a machine learning-based mineral composition analysis model was developed. This model demonstrated reasonable reliability for samples with usual compositions but showed poor performance for unusual samples. Consequently, a clustering model has recently been developed to classify the unusual samples, allowing experts to handle. The purpose of this study is to examine the applicability of the clustering model, developed using XRD data from the Ulleung Basin in previous study, using samples from different regions. Research data consist of intensity profile from XRD experiment and its mineral composition analysis for a total of 54 sediment samples from the Korea Plateau, located northwest of the Ulleung Basin. Because the intensity of samples in the Korea Plateau comprises 7,420 values (3.005-64.996°), differing from 3,100 values (3.01-64.99°) of samples in the Ulleung Basin, linear interpolation was used to align the input feature. Then, min-max scaler was applied to intensity profile for each sample to preserve the trend and peak ratio of the intensity.Applying the clustering model to the 54 preprocessed intensity profiles, 35 samples and 19 samples were classified into expert and machine learning groups, respectively. For machine learning group, false positive was zero among the 19 samples. This means that the clustering model can increase reliability in when mineral composition from machine learning model because unusual sample did not belong to the machine learning group. For the 35 samples in expert group, the 31 samples were classified as false negative (FN). It means that although machine learning model can properly analyze these samples, they were assigned to expert group. However, when these FN samples were analyzed using machine learning based composition analysis model, a high mean absolute error of 2.94% was observed. Therefore, it is reasonable that the samples were assigned to expert group."

One method to increase prediction accuracy is building machine learning models for each cluster which is generally created based on only attribute similarities using cluster analyses. However, spatial data requires clustering to additionally reflect spatial similarities, as considering spatial autocorrelation in a model leads to an increase in prediction accuracy. Therefore, this study explores the impact of spatial clustering with spatial similarities on machine learning prediction accuracy. Specifically, it compares the prediction accuracies of machine learning models generated based on clusters that consider only attribute similarities and those that consider both spatial and attribute similarities. The machine learning techniques employed consist of linear regression model, random forest, and gradient boosting for predicting average daily ridership. The independent variables consist of 11 variables explaining land, population, facility characteristics. The analysis results show that considering both spatial and attribute similarities yields significantly higher prediction accuracy across all models. This study can contribute to the literature on spatial data analyses by demonstrating that considering spatial similarity can improve prediction accuracy when applying spatial data to machine learning."

For the machine learning point sampling, we collected approximately 3% of the total pixels at an identical 250 points per class, referring to a digital land cover map of EGIS. To compare land cover changes, the SVM(Support Vector Machine) model was used. The results of time series analysis shows that areas of wetland and bare soil increased, agricultural and grass decreased, and the areas of built-up, forest, and water did not change significantly over the two years. The monthly f1-score remained between 0.61 and 0.67 and the f1-score in April was the highest. When accuracy verification was performed using the error matrix, water areas showed the highest accuracy. Classes that mainly occur in the context of vegetation activity were often misclassified, and built-up areas were found to be misclassified with classes that see vegetation activity due to seasonal effects. The characteristics of each class were confirmed using variable importance. On average, R, G, B, and NDVI showed high importance values regardless of seasonal conditions, but NIR, SWIR, and Red Edge bands were seasonally affected. Additional studies are expected to improve accuracy by considering the number of samples relative to the class area, the selection of training areas and the selection of indices."

This study implemented a CycleGan deep-learning-based CT image generation from MR images. Three CT generators whose learning is based on T1- , T2- , or T1-&T2-weighted MR images were created, respectively. We found that the T1-weighted MR image-based generator can generate better than other CT generators when T1-weighted MR images are input. In contrast, a T2-weighted MR image-based generator can generate better than other CT generators do when T2-weighted MR images are input.

Accordingly, it is possible to prevent unnecessary waste of national capabilities through the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) and unification of channels, and to provide high-quality security services by realizing simultaneous situation reception, analysis, measures, support, and reporting. To this end, it is necessary to improve the level of security and disaster environment by introducing machine and deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) into the integrated emergency reporting system along with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is also necessary to improve the manpower system in charge of the emergency reporting system. In the case of the organization and manpower in charge of the reporting system, they are distributed and operated by organization, so some organizations repeat shift work with relatively few manpower. As a result, it is difficult for the personnel in charge to have optimal reporting response capabilities due to increased work fatigue and lack of expertise due to frequent job shifts. In particular, the controversy over the 112 report and lack of response regarding the mass casualty accident in Itaewon in October 2022 can be said to be an example of showing limitations such as the operation of the reporting network by manpower. Considering this aspect, it can be said that measures to improve the macro level, such as organizational integration on the emergency reporting system, are necessary. Next, as mentioned above, anyone should be able to use the emergency reporting system in a timely manner in urgent situations, so the target also needs to be improved so that it can be accessed by the disabled and foreigners. For reference, artificial intelligence based on machine learning and deep learning is a technology that allows machines to perform actions by human intelligence, and artificial intelligence based on machine learning and deep learning has the potential to become a real dialogue partner and the subject of creating a discourse that can accurately grasp the context of human speech at a high level, not just a machine. Under these circumstances, the 112 Reporting Operation and Processing Act (abbreviated as 112 Reporting Act) and the 119 Reporting Management and Operation Act (abbreviated as 119 Reporting Act) have been created recently to stipulate the legal basis and methodology for its operation, but there are still insufficient points."

Therefore, learning takes place by using the first derivative of the cost function to find the variable that makes the first derivative equal to 0. Existing methods seek to find the minimum value for one variable. Therefore, making the first derivative of one variable to 0 does not satisfy the minimum value of the cost function. These parts are called partial minima and become an obstacle to machine learning. This may cause machine malfunction and reduce the correct rate of image classification. To avoid this problem, we propose a method that uses the slope direction of the conjugate of the cost function in various ways. It also suggests a method of achieving stable learning by adjusting the learning intensity according to the situation. We confirm that our method is stable and effective through mathematical proofs, geometric models, handwritten o and x classification, and experiments distinguishing general images."

Specifically, this study evaluated the effectiveness of three ensemble techniques—stacking, bag- ging, and boosting—across five levels of data complexity, reflecting the hierarchical structure and varying complexity of standard construction codes. Results indicated that all ensemble mod- els outperformed the base model, with bagging and boosting showing high accuracy in higher- level  codes  (Levels  1-3).  However,  performance  improvements  were  limited  for  lower-level codes (Levels 4-5). These findings suggest that selecting techniques tailored to data complexity can optimize matching accuracy and enhance the potential for automation in construction code applications. Ultimately, precise matching of standard codes to construction items is expected to improve the efficiency and accuracy of construction cost management."
Android Botnet Detection Using Hybrid Analysis,2024,"['Machine Learning', 'Botnet Applications', 'Malware', 'Dynamic', 'Static']",,"Botnet pandemics are becoming more prevalent with the growing use of mobile phone technologies. Mobile phone technologies provide a wide range of applications, including entertainment, commerce, education, and finance. In addition, botnet refers to the collection of compromised devices managed by a botmaster and engaging with each other via a command server to initiate an attack including phishing email, ad-click fraud, blockchain, and much more. As the number of botnet attacks rises, detecting harmful activities is becoming more challenging in handheld devices. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate mobile botnet assaults to find the security vulnerabilities that occur through coordinated command servers causing major financial and ethical harm. For this purpose, we propose a hybrid analysis approach that integrates permissions and API and experiments on the machine-learning classifiers to detect mobile botnet applications. In this paper, the experiment employed benign, botnet, and malware applications for validation of the performance and accuracy of classifiers. The results conclude that a classifier model based on a simple decision tree obtained 99% accuracy with a low 0.003 false-positive rate than other machine learning classifiers for botnet applications detection. As an outcome of this paper, a hybrid approach enhances the accuracy of mobile botnet detection as compared to static and dynamic features when both are taken separately."

First, a mathematical model of the motor efficiency is established, and the current distribution law of the optimal efficiency of the motor in different operating regions is qualitatively analyzed. The control system is based on this current distribution. Second, the sample space is established based on measured data, where the current regression model of the GBDT is introduced. Then by analyzing the importance of characteristic variables, the structure of the model is optimized, and the input and output of the model are reasonably selected, which are embedded into the control system to realize the coordinated control of the current.

Clustering is mainly used for such unsupervised learning. One of the representative methods of such clustering is K-means clustering. Since K-means clustering is a method of determining the number of clusters and continuing to find the central point of the data allocated to the cluster, there is a problem that the clustered group may not be the optimal cluster. In this study, particle swarm optimization algorithm, which determines the motion vector by adding various variables as well as the center point, is applied to K-means clustering. The improved K-means clustering makes it possible to move toward better outcome values even when the center of cluster no longer change. In the conventional clustering method, the center of the cluster moves to the center of the data belonging to the cluster, and clustering ends when the cluster does not change, so other characteristics other than the center value are excluded. Unlike the conventional clustering method, the improved clustering method uses a central value, an average value, and a random value as variables, and a particle swarm optimization algorithm that modifies the vector for each iteration is applied. As a result, improved clustering method derived a better result value than the existing clustering method in the group's fitness index, silhouette score."

While analytic formulas based on well-established interference conditions, such as those employed in single-, double-, and triple-layer antireflective coatings and distributed Bragg reflectors, have provided suitable solutions for traditional optical coatings, they are limited in achieving the intricate spectral characteristics required by multifunctional optical coatings.To overcome this limitation, a variety of machine learning-based design algorithms have been rigorously studied. Among these, binary optimization has proven particularly effective for designing multilayer optical coatings. This approach transforms a given multilayer into a binary vector with multiple bits, where each bit represents one of the constituent materials, and quickly identifies an optimal figureof-merit by analyzing the interactions among the elements of the binary vector. In this review article, we elucidate the principles of binary optimization and explore its applications in the design of multilayers for antireflective coatings for high-numerical-aperture lenses, transparent radiative coolers for energysaving windows, and bandpass filters for thermophotovoltaics. Furthermore, we address the limitations, challenges, and perspectives of machine learning-based optical design to guide directions for future research in this field."

The results revealed 8.4% improvement in accuracy when using a polarized camera over an industrial camera, and a 14% improvement in defect detection accuracy by applying preprocessing. The accuracy improved by up to 7.9% depending on the polarizing camera filter, and the optimal shooting environment and preprocessing process were proposed. The proposed method is expected to be applied to nuts and parts, the accuracy of which has been reduced by noise."
Bi-LSTM model with time distribution for bandwidth prediction in mobile networks,2024,"['bandwidth prediction', 'deep learning', 'handover detection', 'LSTM', 'network recognition']",,"We propose a bandwidth prediction approach based on deep learning. The approach is intended to accurately predict the bandwidth of various types of mobile networks. We first use a machine learning technique, namely, the gra-dient boosting algorithm, to recognize the connected mobile network. Second, we apply a handover detection algorithm based on network recognition to account for vertical handover that causes the bandwidth variance. Third, as the communication performance offered by 3G, 4G, and 5G networks varies, we suggest a bidirectional long short-term memory model with time distribution for bandwidth prediction per network. To increase the prediction accuracy, pretraining and fine-tuning are applied for each type of network. We use a dataset collected at University College Cork for network recognition, hand-over detection, and bandwidth prediction. The performance evaluation indicates that the handover detection algorithm achieves 88.5% accuracy, and the bandwidth prediction model achieves a high accuracy, with a root-mean-square error of only 2.12%."
반도체 칩의 2차원 엑스선 영상에서 배경 제거를 위한 전처리 방법,2024,"['Semiconductor packaging', 'X-ray', 'Deep learning', 'Optimization']",,"Semiconductor packaging technology has advanced in response to the increasing demands for high performance and miniaturization of electronic devices. Wire bonding and bump interconnection methods can detect defects during X-ray inspections in highly integrated semiconductor chips. However, inspection methods using CT scans result in longer scanning times, reducing productivity, and the increased radiation dose can lead to additional defects in the semiconductor chips. To address these issues, this study proposes a preprocessing method that combines deep learning networks, Fourier transform, and machine learning-based optimization techniques. The aim is to improve defect detection in semiconductor chips by removing background information that is not interesting from 2D X-ray projection images.The phantom data for the semiconductor chips was generated using MATLAB, and projection images were acquired using a GPU-based Geant4 simulator (GGEMS). Our proposed method effectively removed the background of semiconductor chip projection images while preserving critical details."

AI-guided investigation of biochar’s efficacy in Pb immobilization for remediation of Pb contaminated agricultural land,2024,"['Heavy metal immobilization', 'Land use', 'UN SDGs', 'Life on land', 'Machine learning', 'Soil remediation']",,"This study evaluated the lead (Pb) immobilization efficiency of biochar in contaminated agricultural soil. The biochar was produced from a range of major biomass residues and pyrolyzed under well-controlled conditions. Ten different types of standard biochar samples were derived from five different feedstocks (i.e., softwood, miscanthus straw, rice husk, oilseed rape straw, wheat straw) and pyrolyzed at 550 ℃ and 700 ℃. Pb-contaminated soil near an abandoned mine was incubated with 2.5% (w w− 1) of biochar. Incubation was conducted for various durations at room temperature under both short-term (21 days) and long-term (214 days) conditions. This variation explicitly accounted for the simulated microplastic contamination during the long-term incubation period. A novel framework has been developed to predict the long-term immobilization effect of various biochar types using a machine-learning approach, following the successful identification of optimal biochar implementations. This prediction method utilizes a small on-field dataset by employing a data augmentation approach, showcasing an innovative approach to forecasting the effects of different biochar types over time. After the incubation period, soil samples were analyzed for their chemical properties. As a result, oil seed rape biochar was the highest in pH, EC, exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+, total nitrogen content, soil organic matter content, and available phosphate.In return, OSR 700 treated soils showed the highest content of exchangeable cations and the lowest content of available Pb after the incubation period. The most efficient biochar for immobilizing lead (Pb) in soil appears to be OSR 700, based on the available evidence."

Here, we analyze 480 historical wildfire occurrences in Gangwon-do between 2003 and 2019 using 17 predictor variables of wildfire occurrence. We utilized three machine learning algorithms―random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine―to construct wildfire susceptibility prediction models and identify the best-performing model for Gangwon-do.

Along with the popularization of high-throughput technologies, community-wide microbial source-tracking methods have been actively developed in recent years. This study aimed to construct a comprehensive fecal microbiome database for community-wide microbial source tracking and apply the database to identify contamination sources in the Miho River, South Korea. Total DNA was extracted from the samples, and the 16 S rRNA gene was amplified to characterize the microbial communities. The fecal microbiome database was validated by developing machine-learning models that predict host species based on microbial community structure. All machine learning models developed in this study showed high performance, where the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was approximately 1. Community-wide microbial source tracking results showed a higher contribution of fecal sources to the contamination of the main streams after heavy rain. In contrast, the contribution of fecal sources remained comparatively stable in tributaries after rainfall. Considering that farms are more concentrated upstream of tributaries compared to the main streams, this result implies that the pathway for manure contaminants to reach the main streams could be groundwater rather than surface runoff. Systematic monitoring of the water quality, which encompasses river water and groundwater, should be conducted in the future. In addition, continuous efforts to identify and plug abandoned wells are necessary to prevent further water contamination."

These findings highlight the importance of debt management in enhancing fiscal soundness and suggest that customized policies are needed based on the cluster type of each local government. This study demonstrates the practical use of data from the Local Fiscal Analysis System and, through unsupervised machine learning-based classification, identifies the unique fiscal characteristics across local governments, emphasizing the need for more efficient fiscal management models. The results can serve as a foundational policy resource for improving fiscal operations and enhancing fiscal soundness in local governments."

To figure out the performance of deep learning based detectors on limited resources, we monitor the performance of several detectors with different H/W resource. On COCO detection datasets, we compare and analyze the evaluation results of detection model in On-Board and the detection model in On-GPU in terms of several metrics with mAP, power consumption, and execution speed (FPS). To demonstrate the effect of applying our detector for the military area, we evaluate them on our dataset consisting of thermal images considering the flight battle scenarios.

It aims to categorize swing voters and consistent loyal voters while exploring the factors that impact changes in party support among voters. We used a machine learning-based random forest prediction model, which has gained popularity in the social science realm, to analyze shifts and continuity in the party support patterns observed in the voting behavior of Korean voters at the group level. Taking a different approach to previous research, this study examines the voting decisions using all accessible survey data and questions, without making any theoretical or deductive assumptions regarding electoral behavior. We analyze how Korean voters’ party loyalty responded to various signs of major changes in the voter political landscape, such as the impeachment of the incumbent president, two regime changes, and deepening political polarization, focusing on whether voters swing. According to the research results, the partisan voting behavior of Korean voters was found to be quite consistent and sustainable even amid changes in the dynamic political environment over the past 10 years. The machine learning model, developed using data from the voter awareness survey conducted during the 19th Presidential Election, demonstrated accuracy that extended beyond that specific year. Furthermore, it showed a relatively high level of accuracy in predicting voting patterns in the 2017 and 2012 presidential elections. The findings imply that swing voters continue to exist in Korean politics even amid the deepening partisan polarization, and that they could play a major role in shaping election results."

Recently, there have been numerous publications on inspecting product quality using machine learning. However, when dealing with small datasets consisting mostly of similar images, the use of machine learning can lead to overfitting and reduced accuracy. Additionally, one limitation of 3D pattern films is the difficulty in detecting contours due to their blurred nature. In this study, we propose a method for inspecting the quality of 3D pattern films using the MLP(Multiplayer Perceptron) model. This involves extracting the width from a specific point to the height in the image histogram of the 3D pattern film, which is then utilized as input for the MLP model. Subsequently, after finding the optimal hyperparameters, the product's quality is evaluated. The proposed approach offers the advantage of using MLP to mitigate the risk of overfitting with a limited number of image data points, thereby achieving high accuracy. Experimental results showed that the proposed method exhibited superior performance with an accuracy of 98.809% compared to other models."

"Study on Automated Forest Change Detection Using Medium- Resolution Satellites: The Case Study of Dogyemyeon, Samcheok City",2024,"['Forest change', 'Medium-resolution satellite imagery', 'Landsat', 'Forest fire']",,"Land use constantly changes due to climate change and human activities. Above all else, monitoring forests is crucial for global carbon management, particularly in the context of climate change. Land use changes in forested areas occur due to various factors such as development projects or natural disasters; forest fires are one of the primary drivers of large-scale forest loss. Therefore, it is essential to detect forest changes including forest fires accurately and to develop an automated system for periodic monitoring. In response, this study proposes a machine learning-based method for automating forest change detection using multi-temporal medium-resolution satellite imagery. As a case study area, the Dogye-eup, Samcheok was selected which experienced rapid forest change following significant forest fires in 2017. To construct spatial datasets for the factors influencing forest changes, key spectral bands were extracted after preprocessing the satellite images, and indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were computed. Additionally, slope values were derived from digital elevation model (DEM) data to further enhance the dataset. Using the training set based on NDVI derived from a forest map and single-season imagery, a forest probability map was generated through a machine-learning model based on artificial neural network (ANN). The final estimate of forest reduction was determined by analyzing seasonal imagery differentials and their summation. This automated approach to extracting training data from satellite imagery and pre-existing datasets offers significant potential to enhance the automation of forest monitoring."

Serious diseases are the main cause worldwide, and 80% of all deaths are disappearing, emerging as a minority problem. In this paper, we identified the main partial code occurrence causes and risk factors through role data analysis using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The NLP model is designed based on Google's pre-learning language model and Transformer. Through this, we evaluate the Japanese incidence rate based on various activities such as patient activity, age, and lifestyle (smoking and drinking). As a result of the analysis, the correlation between efficacy and whether or not to take it is the highest, and the effect that emphasizes efficacy is highlighted.

Unlike patent literature, non-patent literature is not standardized and lacks a unified search system, thus necessitating separate searches for patents and non-patents. This renders the process particularly challenging for the latter. Hence, classification methods used in patent literature are applied to non-patent literature in this study, thus enabling a search system that operates in the same manner as patent-literature searches. The proposal includes the application of machine-learning techniques to recommend or automatically assign patent-classification codes to non-patent literature. For example, a process is reviewed in which international patent classificationcodes are automatically assigned to scholarly papers using machine-learning algorithms. Based on analyzing methods that leverage text-similarity and text-classification algorithms, the automatic classification of non-patent literature through patent-literature text mining is shown to be effective and thus warrants further research. Building a database of non-patent literature coded with patent classifications can result in a more efficient prior-art search process by allowing searches under a unified classification system for both patent and non-patent literatures."
Sarcopenia diagnosis in patients with colorectal cancer: a review of computed tomography-based assessments and emerging ways to enhance practicality,2024,"['Colorectal neoplasms', 'Computed tomography', 'Diagnosis', 'Myosteatosis', 'Sarcopenia']",,"Traditionally, cancer treatment has focused on the stages of the disease; however, recent studies have highlighted the importance of considering the overall health status of patients in the prognosis of cancer. Loss of skeletal muscle, known as sarcopenia, has been found to significantly affect outcomes in many different types of cancers, including colorectal cancer. In this review, we discuss the guidelines for diagnosing sarcopenia, with a specific focus on CT-based assessments. Many groups worldwide, including those in Europe and Asia, have introduced their own diagnostic guidelines for sarcopenia. Seemingly similar yet subtle discrepancies, particularly in the cutoff values used, limit the use of these guidelines in the general population, warranting a more universal guideline. Although CT-based measurements, such as skeletal muscle index and radiodensity, have shown promise in predicting outcomes, the lack of standardized values in these measurements hinders their universal adoption. To overcome these limitations, innovative approaches are being developed to assess changes in muscle mass trajectories and introduce new indices, such as skeletal and appendicular muscle gauges. Additionally, machine learning models have shown superior performance in predicting sarcopenic status, providing an alternative to CT-based diagnosis, particularly after surgery. CT has tremendous benefits and a significant role in visually as well as quantitatively retrieving information on patient body composition. In order to compensate for the limitation of standard cutoff value, 3-dimensional analysis of the CT, artificial intelligence-based body composition analysis, as well as machine learning algorithms for data interpretation and analysis have been proposed and are being utilized. In conclusion, despite the varying definitions of sarcopenia, CT-based measurements coupled with machine-learning models are promising for evaluating patients with cancer. Standardization efforts can improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce the reliance on CT examinations, and make sarcopenia assessments more accessible in clinical settings."

To do so, we examined examples ranging from experimental projects that pioneered computational photography in the 1990s, to computer vision techniques, to art projects using generative adversarial neural network models since the 2010s, and analyzed the structural homologies between them from a techno-aesthetic perspective. Art ex machina, machine-made art that generates new images through machine learning based on the quantitative expansion of vast amounts of image data, creates a mechanism with its own life force through new permutations between huge image data. This creative structure is summarized as an autonomous cybernetic, or bio-cybernetic reproduction that is outside the realm of human programming. From this perspective, a meta-image, which is the relationship between image data, is not a simple replication of past data, but a newly created de-bordered image between data and data. As a result, the key to the relationship between bio-cybernetic reproduction and meta-image is that the two concepts are complementary.

Recently, with the advancement of machine learning technologies, artificial intelligence (AI)-based RUL prediction models for batteries have been actively researched. However, existing models have limitations as the reasoning process within the models is not transparent, making it difficult to fully trust and utilize the predicted values derived from machine learning. To address this issue, various explainable AI techniques have been proposed, but these techniques typically visualize results in the form of graphs, requiring users to manually analyze the graphs. In this paper, we propose an explainable RUL prediction method for lithium-ion batteries that interprets the reasoning process of the prediction model in textual form using SHAP analysis based on large language models (LLMs).

For this purpose, the discussions of Gilbert Simondon and the perspectives of Rosi Braidotti have been referenced. Simondon understands technology as a fundamental factor in the constitution of the human, emphasizing the ensemble relationship between humans and machines. Braidotti, on the other hand, highlights the zoe-geo-techno ensemble, where not only humans and machines but all living beings co-evolve in a mutually cooperative manner. The posthuman, composed of a zoe-geo-techno assemblage, is not an exclusive privilege of humans; rather, it is constituted through transversal relationships with non-human others. These relationships become possible by relinquishing the idea of privilege that places humans at the center of the world. In poetry, such relationships are realized through the gaps that emerge as the poet's consciousness collapses. However, the form of the subject that emerges at this point, and the nature of its relationships, are configured in distinctly different ways.In the works of some poets appear technological entities such as artificial intelligence (AI) robots, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT). From a human perspective, these technological machines are often seen merely as tools to be used for improving life. However, poets breathe life into these machines, depicting them as companions. In these poems, machines are portrayed as cyborg entities that possess both human and machine characters. The poetic egos in these works demonstrate the possibility of coexistence by either opening up a space where reason dissipates as they abandon the will to transform (or modify) the object (as seen in Moon Jung-young’s work), or by engaging in emotional resonance through conversations with machine-human hybrids (as in the works of Kim Hye-young, Yoo Seung-hyun, and Kim Yeon-ah). In these relationships, machines and humans are depicted as mutually independent beings that empathize and cooperate with one another.Meanwhile, some poems depict humans who have been modified or newly born through technology. In these works, human beings are envisioned as hybrids, blending human, animal, and angelic qualities, such as the hybrids created by Shin Hae-wook, or the new human beings with wings and talons in Kim Bok-hee’s poetry. Other examples include the book-AI in Kim Jong-yeon’s work, which creates a new language (or memory) by erasing learned memories, and the bird consisting of only a heart in Lee Won’s poetry. These hybrid entities are evoked through images that intertwine various forms of life and language. From a human perspective, these hybrids might be considered non-human, abnormal, or monstrous beings that do not fit within the conventional subjectivity. Yet, paradoxically, by not belonging to a single species, these entities can transcend the boundaries of the human domain. These hybrids, which are neither human, machine, nor animal, embody the potential to become anything—they exist in the space between ""no longer"" and ""not yet""— and emit the energy of life (zoe) newly generated across the binary division. This energy, representing a poetic force dreaming of a transition to a new world, emerges from the point of nothingness, where the consciousness of the self collapses.Recent poetry can be seen as moving beyond merely deconstructing the established concept of the human, toward exploring a posthuman subjectivity characterized by relational existence. Dialogues and empathy with cyborgs—beings that possess both machineness and humanness—illustrate the possibility of cooperative coexistence between humans and machines, challenging the traditional notion of humans as solely possessing and utilizing technology. Hybrid entities that simultaneously encompass the human, the technological, and the animal realms form a transversal ensemble that, while neither unified nor identical, exist toget..."

Korea, which has consistently been evaluated as a top country, can clearly be said to be a leading country in the world of e-government. The lubricant of e-government is data. Data itself is neither information nor a record, but it is a source of information and records and a resource of knowledge. Since administrative actions through electronic systems have become widespread, the production and technology of data-based records have naturally expanded and evolved. Technology may seem value-neutral, but in fact, technology itself reflects a specific worldview.The digital order of new technologies, armed with hyper-connectivity and super-intelligence, not only has a profound influence on traditional power structures, but also has an a similar influence on existing information and knowledge transmission media. Moreover, new technologies and media, including data-based generative artificial intelligence, are by far the hot topic. It can be seen that the all-round growth and spread of digital technology has led to the augmentation of human capabilities and the outsourcing of thinking. This also involves a variety of problems, ranging from deep fakes and other fake images, auto profiling, AI lies hallucination that creates them as if they were real, and copyright infringement of machine learning data. Moreover, radical connectivity capabilities enable the instantaneous sharing of vast amounts of data and rely on the technological unconscious to generate actions without awareness. Another irony of the digital world and online network, which is based on immaterial distribution and logical existence, is that access and contact can only be made through physical tools. Digital information is a logical object, but digital resources cannot be read or utilized without some type of device to relay it.In that respect, machines in today’s technological society have gone beyond the level of simple assistance, and there are points at which it is difficult to say that the entry of machines into human society is a natural change pattern due to advanced technological development.This is because perspectives on machines will change over time.Important is the social and cultural implications of changes in the way records are produced as a result of communication and actions through machines.Even in the archive field, what problems will a data-based archive society face due to technological changes toward a hyper-intelligence and hyper-connected society, and who will prove the continuous activity of records and data and what will be the main drivers of media change? It is time to research whether this will happen. This study began with the need to recognize that archives are not only records that are the result of actions, but also data as strategic assets. Through this, author considered how to expand traditional boundaries and achieves reterritorialization in a data-driven society."

Subsequently, labels for the characteristic categories of complaints were defined, followed by a comparative analysis of the performance of each classification algorithm using supervised learning.Results in Research: The experimental results showed that the classification accuracy followed the order of CNN < LSTM < Ko-BERT. Thus, it was revealed that for multi-category classification of diverse topics in informal and small-scale text, it is essential to consider sequences and contexts rather than extracting document features.Research Conclusion: The academic contribution of this study lies in comparing and analyzing algorithms from traditional classifiers to the latest deep learning algorithms under the same experimental conditions, thereby elucidating the differences between algorithms. From a practical standpoint, the evaluation of classification performance for informal documents such as complaints in this study could be utilized for processing and classifying low-quality text data of various topics, including small-scale SNS data and other complaints with complex categories, in the future."

Development of an Instantaneously Interpretable Real-Time Dosimeter System for Quality Assurance of a Medical Linear Accelerator,2024,"['Dosimeter', 'Real-time', 'Deep learning', 'Dose rate', 'Multi-leaf collimators']",,"Purpose: Modern radiotherapy delivers radiation doses to targets within a few minutes using intricate multiple-beam segments determined with multi-leaf collimators (MLC). Therefore, we propose a scintillator-based dosimetry system capable of assessing the dosimetric and mechanical performance of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in real time.Methods: The dosimeter was equipped with a scintillator plate and two digital cameras. The dose distribution was generated by applying deep learning-based signal processing to correct the intrinsic characteristics of the camera sensor and a tomographic image reconstruction technique to rectify the geometric distortion of the recorded video. Dosimetric evaluations were performed using a gamma analysis against a two-dimensional array and radiochromic film measurements for 20 clinical cases. The average difference in the MLC position measurements and machine log files was tested for the applicability of the mechanical quality assurance (QA) of MLCs.Results: The agreement of the dose distribution in the IMRT and VMAT plans was clinically acceptable between the proposed system and conventional dosimeters. The average differences in the MLC positions for the IMRT/VMAT plans were 1.7010/2.8107 mm and 1.4722/2.7713 mm in banks A and B, respectively.Conclusions: In this study, we developed an instantaneously interpretable real-time dosimeter for QA in a medical linear accelerator using a scintillator plate and digital cameras. The feasibility of the proposed system was investigated using dosimetric and mechanical evaluations in the IMRT and VMAT plans.

Prediction of permissioned blockchain performance for resource scaling configurations,2024,['Blockchain-as-a-servicePermissioned blockchainResource scalingMachine learning'],,"Blockchain is increasingly offered as blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) by cloud service providers. However, configuring BaaS appropriately for optimal performance and reliability resorts to try-and-error. A key challenge is that BaaS is often perceived as a “black-box,” leading to uncertainties in performance and resource provisioning. Previous studies attempted to address this challenge; however, the impacts of both vertical and horizontal scaling remain elusive. To this end, we present machine learning-based models to predict network reliability and throughput based on scaling configurations. In our evaluation, the models exhibit prediction errors of 1.9%, which is highly accurate and can be applied in the real-world."

This selected region of interest was used as a template to match all other occurrences of the same letter within the Manchu script image. Although the dataset in this study contained only 4,000 images of five Manchu script letters, these letters were collected from twenty-eight writing styles.

In particular, we are working hard to solve various phenomena and problems that arise as the way of working within organizations changes due to the development of digital technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and machine learning. However, since the changes caused by COVID-19 have expanded beyond the level of simply developing individual capabilities to the level of developing the organization as a whole, HRD managers have moved beyond the perception of the organization and its members before COVID-19 and are looking at the current changes from an organizational culture perspective. There is a need to recognize and improve. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to explore how HRD managers within companies are changing their perception of the organizational culture of their organizations as they experience COVID-19, and what the meaning of that change in perception is. To this end, we attempted to examine a narrative research method that explores insights by reconstructing stories about the research topic based on the stories experienced by research participants. Eight research participants were selected using a purposive sampling method, and a more detailed and specific meaning was interpreted using unstructured in-depth interviews, participant observation, and literature research analysis. Research on this is expected to explore how the various roles that HRD managers must perform and the type of organizational culture they aim to pursue and create are changing as perceptions of organizational culture change in the future."

In the case of lower limbmovement, most of the research is on the static state or single movements. Therefore, in this research, we developed adeep-learning model for classifying walking behavior(1: walking, 2: upstairs, 3: downstairs) based on EEG signals in adynamic environment to verify the possibility of classifying EEG signals in a dynamic state.

Anomaly Detection in Predictive Maintenance using Dynamic Time Warping,2024,"['Dynamic Time Warping', 'Predictive Maintenance', 'Anomaly Detection', 'Multiple Facilities']",,"Manufacturing systems face the fundamental challenge of efficient operation by leveraging vast amounts of real-time data collected through technological advancements such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Maintenance systems have evolved to predict and manage equipment failures in advance, with data-driven fault detection being a crucial technology. However, most related research has been limited to single equipment for specific processes, making the direct application in actual manufacturing settings that use various equipment models or types challenging. When using multifacility models, the most crucial aspect is the analysis of variations and errors in the data collected from each facility. To mitigate the risk associated with a sole vendor, different models of equipment is used strategically, even for the same functionality. Consequently, collecting temporally mismatched data is prevalent. The current methodology, which has been predominantly focused on a single-facility approach, faces limitations in its application when dealing with unstructured, unlabeled data, or temporally mismatched data obtained across multiple facilities. This study employed the dynamic time warping (DTW) method to analyze discrepancies in time-series data obtained from multiple equipment groups by leveraging similarity analysis of data peak matching for anomaly detection. Specifically, an approach called auto time windowing is adopted to extract signal periods based on the detailed signal analysis results of the process, enabling the application of DTW. The auto time windowing allows for the accurate automated analysis of signal period by overcoming the limitations of analysis errors caused by noise in the existing data using the threshold of the actual signal. This methodology is validated for two different equipment groups involved in a real-world production process, where parts are attached to products. The results of this study demonstrated an improvement over conventional time-series analysis methods such as the Euclidean method, addressing errors that may occur. This research enhances the analysis theory using DTW for the actual problem of data discrepancies among multiple equipment groups in the manufacturing field, which is not previously considered in existing predictive maintenance (PdM) theories. This validation through case studies effectively contributes to expanding the utilization of PdM."

The protected characteristics under Section 1557 include race, color, national origin, sex, age, and disability. As in other sectors, machine learning-based algorithms present a challenge in applying antidiscrimination law due to their opaque, black-box nature. At the practical level, the tendency of many courts to deny private right of action in a disparate impact claim under Section 1557 acts as a disincentive for people in a protected class to seek legal action.In Korea, the challenges in preventing or mitigating algorithmic bias in healthcare are compounded. First and foremost, no antidiscrimination law exists in the healthcare sector yet. Notwithstanding, the artificial intelligence bills proposed to the National Assembly and the ethical guidelines published by the medical community stipulate that preventing discrimination or bias is essential in developing artificial intelligence, leaving in the vacuum which characteristics should be protected. In addition, health disparity has not been a significant issue in Korean healthcare in general. For Korea, the initial efforts should lay down the necessary first step by defining the protected characteristics that reflect public health research while being compatible with other sectoral antidiscrimination laws."

Factors that increase complexity are, among others, roads and both the azimuth and elevation angle of the sensor. In this study, two different effective HRB detection techniques are proposed. The first method is using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), an extensively used tool for pattern recognition in the field of machine learning. However, domain movement considerably reduces the CNNs performance on the test data in other domains, making it difficult to generalize. Besides, obtaining the dense annotations on the remote sensing images is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, a new object-based approach is proposed that includes multi-resolution segmentation and relief displacement by azimuth angles of the sensor. Both methods were tested using images from four regions in South Korea using VHR (Very High Resolution) satellite imagery from the KOMPSAT-3 and WorldView-3.

Therefore, their use has been increasing lately. Conventionally, resonant type transducers have been applied to enhance the signal to noise ratio. Recently, this diagnostic technology has been combined with array-based sound source localization techniques, making it possible to not only estimate the location of occurrence but also improve the signal through spatial filtering and to ensure a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio even with a broadband sensor such as a microphone. This implies that the signal characteristics of a wide frequency band can be used for diagnosis and it can be expanded from simply identifying the presence or absence of an abnormality to identifying the type and degree of the abnormality. In this study, the acoustic signals induced by gas leakages and partial discharges were measured and the detailed time and frequency characteristics were observed. For this purpose, simulating devices to create the leakage and partial discharge were designed. It was observed that the signal in the frequency band of interest increased dramatically through spatial and high pass filtering. In addition, it was confirmed that a good decision is made in the machine learning-based model using a spectrogram based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to classify the types of abnormality.

As a result, the amount of personal information collected from online services has increased, and concerns about users' personal information leakage and privacy infringement have increased. Online service providers provide privacy policies to address concerns about privacy infringement of users, but privacy policies are often misused due to the long and complex problem that it is difficult for users to directly identify risk items. Therefore, there is a need for a method that can automatically check whether the privacy policy is safe. However, the safety verification technique of the conventional blacklist and machine learning-based privacy policy has a problem that is difficult to expand or has low accessibility. In this paper, to solve the problem, we propose a safety verification technique for the privacy policy using the GPT-3.5 API, which is a generative artificial intelligence. Classification work can be performed even in a new environment, and it shows the possibility that the general public without expertise can easily inspect the privacy policy. In the experiment, how accurately the blacklist-based privacy policy and the GPT-based privacy policy classify safe and unsafe sentences and the time spent on classification was measured. According to the experimental results, the proposed technique showed 10.34% higher accuracy on average than the conventional blacklist-based sentence safety verification technique."
Enhancing Career Fit : A Big Data-driven “Job Matching” System,2024,"['Information Systems Design', 'Big Data', 'Latent Dirichlet Allocation Analysis', 'Decision Systems']",,"Often, a worker’s occupational domain and educational qualifications mismatch, leading to a discrepancy with their actual skill set. This can lead to either underperformance or overperformance, as the competencies required by the company may differ from those possessed by potential employees. This research aims to develop a system for matching user profiles and job vacancies called the Job Matching System. The system can help individuals find jobs that suit their educational background and skills. By collecting large amounts of data from the Jobstreet.co.id website, the system automatically identifies job opportunities in four job categories, which are data analyst, digital marketing, developer, and machine learning. We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach to analyze the gathered data and identify potential topics within large data sets. Based on this information, the database correlates educational background with appropriate job classifications. The Job Matching website has a built-in decision-making tool. Prior knowledge of the worker’s background is required to aid in the matching procedure and facilitate the alignment of competencies with the worker’s preferred industry throughout the matching process."

Acoustic signal-based anomaly detection technology has the advantage of performing fault detection at a low cost compared to conventional image/video-based or other sensor-based anomaly detection technologies. However, utilizing a large amount of acoustic signals collected from sensors requires a lot of computing resources for intensive signal processing and learning. Therefore, it is necessary to consider an acoustic signal-based anomaly detection system that utilizes computing resources efficiently. In this paper, we propose a method for extracting the band energy of acoustic signals using discrete wavelet transform and design a lightweight anomaly detection model. Experiments show that the band energy based on discrete wavelet transform can effectively compress the features of acoustic signals, reduce the data preprocessing time, and enable the construction of a lightweight anomaly detection model."

Throughout  the  investigation,  I  aim  to  identify certain  normative  challenges  in  elevating  current  AI  to  a  level  comparable  to that  of  human  experts.  First,  I  will  narrow  the  scope  by  proposing  the definition of an expert. Along the way, three normative components  of  experts —trust,  explainability,  and  responsibility—will  be  presented.  Subsequently,  I  will suggest why AI cannot become a trustee, successfully transmit knowledge,  or take responsibility. Specifically, the arguments focus on how these  factors regulate expert judgments, which are not made in isolation but within complex social connections and spontaneous dialogue. Finally, I will defend the plausibility of the presented criteria in response to a potential objection, the claim that some  machine  learning-based  algorithms,  such  as  AlphaGo,  have  already  been recognized as experts."
A feasibility study on distinguishing fluor concentrations in liquid scintillators from scintillation events observed by photomultiplier tubes using convolutional neural networks,2024,"['Liquid scintillator · Linear alkyl benzene · 2', '5-Diphenyloxazole · 1', '4-Bis(2-methylstyryl)benzene · Light yield · Pulse shape · Wavelength shift · Convolution neural network']",,"Linear alkyl benzene-based liquid scintillators (LSs) have been extensively used as targets for neutrino detectors in recent decades owing to their environmentally friendly properties, high light yield, and cost efciency. Neutrino events are typically reconstructed from scintillation events observed by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) attached to the detector. A comprehensive understanding of the LS response is required for interpreting reconstructed neutrino events during detector operation. In this study, we investigate the properties of scintillation events such as light yield, waveform, and wavelength shift of the emitted scintillation light at various concentrations of fuor dissolved in the LS. The light yield, waveform, and wavelength shift exhibit a nonlinear relationship with fuor concentration, complicating the determination of fuor concentration from the observed characteristics of the scintillation events. We employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to model this nonlinear relationship between fuor concentration and LS properties. The CNN learns the distinctive features of the scintillation events from observed waveforms and the relative ratio of the light yield below 425 nm to the total light yield detected by a PMT at diferent fuor concentrations. The trained CNN was able to distinguish the scintillation events with diferent 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 1,4-bis(2-methylstyryl)benzene concentrations according to the observed waveform and relative wavelength shift. The classifed scintillation events for each LS sample exhibited clear features for the diferent LS concentrations, emphasizing the discriminative capability of the trained CNN. This research presents the frst demonstration of LS fuor concentration discrimination using machine-learning techniques in PMT-based detectors."
PrivacyGuard: Collaborative Edge-Cloud Computing Architecture for Attribute-Preserving Face Anonymization in CCTV Networks,2024,"['Video De-identification', 'Privacy Protection', 'Face Anonymization', 'Security and Forensics', 'Privacy and Usability']",,"Closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage, a vital component of security and law enforcement, also poses a potential privacy threat. To mitigate this, it's crucial to anonymize personal identifiers in the footage, preventing their unauthorized or unintended use or disclosure. An effective anonymization system should remove sensitive identity information while preserving attributes necessary for other identity-agnostic tasks. Among several biometric personal identifiers, the face is the primary one. However, anonymizing facial images while retaining facial attributes is a challenging task. Furthermore, neural networks, instrumental in face detection and recognition, often come with significant computational demands, making them unsuitable for resourceconstrained edge devices. In a novel approach, our study proposes PrivacyGuard, a modular architecture with two major parts: the image quality assessment and dispatching module, and the attribute-preserving anonymization module. The former categorizes images by quality, sending low-quality images to cloud servers and processing high-quality ones on local edge servers. Simultaneously, the anonymization module leverages lightweight NN models on the edge to generate obfuscated images while preserving the relevant attributes for downstream machine-learning tasks. Experimental results on a diverse dataset (i.e., ethnicities, genders, etc.) demonstrate the model's effectiveness in quality assessment and anonymization while retaining the relevant attributes. The anonymization model achieves an attribute preservation rate of 98%, along with obfuscated identities."

"Toward Improved Site-Adaptation for Direct Normal Irradiance: Exploiting Sky-Condition Classification for Improved Regression-Based, Quantile-Based, and Neural Network Models",2024,['Solar irradiance · Direct normal irradiance · Site-adaptation · Regression · Quantile mapping · Artificial neural network'],,"Site adaptation has become a necessary step in resource assessment for ensuring the bankability of a renewable energy project.The process involves collecting short-term observation data to correct the long-term dataset available from the satellitederived models, which could thus provide a more accurate estimate of the solar resource data. This study aims to enhance the site-adaptation of direct normal irradiance, as its correction remains notably challenging in comparison to global horizontal irradiance due to its larger error, which is often attributed to the complexity of cloud modeling. A new methodology for site-adaptation is proposed that exploits the use of a new indicator variable that describes the correctness of sky-condition classification by the clear-sky index. This variable has dual applications within the context of site adaptation: firstly, it is employed in the two-step binning procedure subsequent to the conventional clear-sky binning during preprocessing, and secondly, it serves as an additional input feature in machine-learning-based site adaptation. The results show that the former method can reduce the mean bias error to a mere 0.4%, while the latter is better for reducing large discrepancies as shown by the lower root mean squared error."

Specifically, we developed methodologies to determine whether mentions, such as full names of herbal formula and their abbreviations, refer to the same concept. Two different approaches were attempted. First, we built a supervised classification model that uses BERT-based contextual vectors and character similarity features of herbal formula mentions in medical texts to determine whether two mentions are identical. Second, we applied a prompt-based querying method using GPT-4o mini and GPT-4o to perform the same task. Both methods achieved over 0.9 in Precision, Recall, and F1-score, with the GPT-4o-based approach demonstrating the highest Precision and F1-Score. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning-based approaches for named entity normalization in traditional medicine texts, with the GPT-4o-based method showing superior performance. This suggests its potential as a valuable foundation for the development of intelligent information extraction systems in the traditional medicine domain."

There are several methods for determining statistical significance or relationships between different database sets. We propose a method that best represents the statistical difference between actual LID-based traffic volume estimates and the VDS values (i.e., true values) for the same road segment.METHODS : A total of 2,496 datasets aggregated for 1-h LID and VDS data were subjected to various statistical analyses to evaluate the consistency of the two datasets. The VDS data were defined as the true values for comparison. Four different statistical techniques (procrutes, 2-sample t-test, paired-sample t-test, and model performance rating scale) were applied.RESULTS : In cases where there is a specific pattern (e.g., traffic volume distribution considering peak and off-peak times), distribution tests such as Procrustes or Kolmogorov-Smirnov are useful because not only the prediction accuracy but also the similarity of the data distribution shape is important.CONCLUSIONS : The findings of this study provide important insight into the reliability of LID-based traffic volume estimation. To evaluate the reliability between the two groups, a paired-sample t-test was considered more appropriate than the performance evaluation measure of the machine-learning model. However, it is important to set the acceptance criteria necessary to statistically determine whether the difference between the two groups in the paired-sample t-test varies according to the given problem."

First, the concept of digital literacy and research trends related to art and digital literacy education were reviewed. Then, Deleuze's image ontology was explored, and based on this, the direction of art and digital literacy education was suggested. Through Cinema, Deleuze said that images are not illusory representations but parts of reality that we must contemplate. He believed that a new reality could be created by deterritorialization from a territorialized perspective, triggered by encountering images. While exploring Deleuze's image ontology, the researcher discovered the possibility that art and digital literacy education could evolve in the creative and innovative direction unique to art. To realize that possibility, the researcher proposes that art and digital literacy education focus on artistic emotional training, the process of becoming a thinking machine, and difference-generating learning."

Satellite remote sensing technology offers a new paradigm for monitoring agricultural crops at large scale. Daily access to satellite imagery from Planet Scope allows opportunities to continuously monitor the Earth’s surface in 3-m resolution with various spectrums. However, satellites on agricultural applications are still in less information to agriculture producers due to the limited access to analytic software. The paper aims to fill the gap between the satellite resources and the agricultural users, specifically to develop satellite image analytic software publicly available for agricultural crop health monitoring.Methods Open-source software, iCalendar, was developed for high-throughput image analysis and visualization of a vegetation index (VI) and a time-series crop growth. Application programing interface (API) was used to automate the image queuing, activation, and download based on user-defined time and area of interest.Results The API was refined to filter unusable data such as multiples of clipped images and duplicates of tile images.iCalendar resulted in the seamless data processing and automated user-friendly visualization of a seasonal VI profile and a corresponding field map calendar, that are key sources of crop production cycle. Machine learning-based segmentation algorithm and radiometric calibration showed the detection and correction of abnormalities in the image.Conclusion The satellite image-based plant monitoring system through open-source software iCalendar provided a significant improvement to spatiotemporal field observation and allows growers and researchers in-season crop health assessment, thereby promoting new management strategies for crop productivity and protection."

As mathematics is an essential subject of the K-12 curriculum, research on automated scoring of constructed mathematical responses is of great importance. However, unlike research on automated scoring in other subjects’ responses, studies for automated scoring of mathematical responses still require further exploration. In this study, we propose classification criteria for mathematical constructed responses including response types and input types, identified 21 studies from 15 academic journals registered in SCOPUS with systematic literature review, and investigated them in detail. As a result, Research on automated scoring of mathematical constructed responses has gradually increased in the 2010s, and mainly focusing on algebra and functions, number and operations at the secondary school level. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, automated scoring models have also evolved from early rule-based and statistical-based models to machine learning-, deep learning-, and large language models. Furthermore, early automated scoring studies which focused solely on single-modal and digital formatted answers are progressing toward automated scoring of multi-modal and handwritten answers. Based on these findings, We propose a framework that can classify research based on response types and input data formats. Finally, we conclude by emphasizing the importance and necessity of research in automated scoring of constructed mathematical responses, and by providing suggestions for future research directions."

The research specifically compares and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of text mining methods based on n-gram and BERT models.This study applies both text mining techniques to the analysis of classical Chinese poetry to evaluate their utility and limitations. The results highlight distinct characteristics and performances of the n-gram and BERT models, emphasizing the need for a complementary approach when analyzing traditional literary texts. While n-gram analysis is effective for identifying simple patterns and understanding the overall structure of the text, the BERT model excels in deeper contextual analysis and semantic interpretation.Through n-gram analysis, this research demonstrates the potential to gain a clearer understanding of a poet’s literary tendencies and thematic intentions by analyzing frequently occurring words and phrases in classical Chinese poetry. Additionally, the construction of ontologies based on these analyses can offer deeper insights into the literary value of the texts.Furthermore, cosine similarity analysis of Kim Chang-hyeop's classical Chinese poetry using the BERT model shows that machine-driven analysis holds promise. However, due to current technological limitations, the tools accessible to researchers are still in their developmental stages and not yet fully optimized. While the results may be readily interpretable by scholars of classical literature, large-scale machine learning applications in classical Chinese poetry require significant computational resources and further technical refinement.This paper proposes a new research methodology for accessing the literary meaning and structure of classical Chinese poetry through text mining techniques. The study suggests that further application and comparison of various text analysis models could lead to more refined and sophisticated literary interpretations."

In this paper, we consider a hierarchical structure across multiple related tasks with a hierarchy of sub-tasks under the same main task, where representations used to solve the sub-tasks share more information through task-specific layers, globally shared layers, and locally shared layers. We thus propose the hierarchical multi-task learning with self-supervised auxiliary task (HiSS), which is a novel approach for hierarchical multi-task learning that incorporates self-supervised learning as an auxiliary task. The goal of the auxiliary task is to further extract latent information from the unlabeled data by predicting a cluster label directly derived from the data. The proposed approach is tested on the Hyodoll dataset, which consists of user information and activity logs of elderly individuals collected by AI companion robots, for predicting emergency calls based on the time of day and month. Our proposed algorithm is more efficient than other wellknown machine learning algorithms as it requires only a single model regardless of the number of tasks, and demonstrates superior performance in classification tasks using various metrics.

Recently, numerous prior studies on image generation using artificial intelligence have emerged, reflecting this growing interest. However, from a practical standpoint, there are several criticisms: the images generated by machine learning often lack the resolution required by designers, and they fall short in providing original images. It is worth examining whether the perspectives of these prior studies are becoming teleologically biased. Therefore, this study aims to explore the gap between interdisciplinary discussions and practical applications, seeking to bridge this gap and integrate AI-generated image creation into practical use. This research is based on a literature review of Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) in machine learning(ml), examining whether the images generated are acceptable from the perspective of product designers. Based on this, we will use text mining methods to perform clustering, information extraction, and sentiment analysis to understand consumer attitudes. Through this approach, we aim to explore the potential use of AI in product design from the standpoint of consumers and practitioners rather than an interdisciplinary perspective."

연합 Isolation Forest,2024,"['Federated Learning', 'Isolation Forest', 'Non-IID Data', 'Outlier Detection']",,"Outlier detection is the task of detecting data that significantly deviates from normal patterns and is applied in a variety of application fields. However, most outlier detection techniques are designed to be applied to centralized data, making it difficult to properly respond to privacy protection or limitations in data collection and sharing. In this paper, we propose a method for learning Isolation Forest in a federated learning environment that shares a global machine learning model while maintaining independent storage of data among clients. In the proposed method, instead of learning complete isolation trees from each client, we construct Isolation Forest that can reflect various data distributions among clients by increasing the height of the tree by 1 in a randomly selected client and repeating this process until a limited tree height is reached. Experimental results in a federated learning environment in which normal data consists of data of multiple classes and clients include only some of the normal classes demonstrate that the Isolation Forest by the proposed method obtains high outlier detection performance in a federated learning environment of non-IID data."
Study on Accelerating Distributed ML Training in Orchestration,2024,"['Distributed Machine Learning', 'ML Model Training', 'Orchestration', 'Parameter Server', 'Resource Allocation']",,"As the size of data and models in machine learning training continues to grow, training on a single server is becoming increasingly challenging. Consequently, the importance of distributed machine learning, which distributes computational loads across multiple machines, is becoming more prominent. However, several unresolved issues remain regarding the performance enhancement of distributed machine learning, including communication overhead, inter-node synchronization challenges, data imbalance and bias, as well as resource management and scheduling. In this paper, we propose ParamHub, which utilizes orchestration to accelerate training speed. This system monitors the performance of each node after the first iteration and reallocates resources to slow nodes, thereby speeding up the training process. This approach ensures that resources are appropriately allocated to nodes in need, maximizing the overall efficiency of resource utilization and enabling all nodes to perform tasks uniformly, resulting in a faster training speed overall.

Data for Al–Zn–Mg–Cu based 7xxx-seriesaluminum alloys with minor elements of Mn, Zr, Cr, Ti, Si and Fe, and their UTS were collected and used for training ofmajor machine learning algorithms. Machine learning with composition-UTS dataset showed better predictability (R2 = 0.82),compared to machine learning with composition-driven elemental property-UTS dataset (R2 = 0.79). Ensemble model withcombination of the two datasets-based models exhibited improved predictability (R2 = 0.83). Synthetic composition-UTSsets that augmented original composition-UTS dataset were generated through noising and denoising processes of diffusionmodel, followed by duplication filtering, compositional validity filtering, and large error filtering between ensemble modelpredictedUTS and diffusion model-generated UTS. The spatial distribution of original compositions and their UTS werefound to be highly correlated with diffusion model-generated synthetic compositions and their UTS in a reduced dimensionof t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Visualization of synthetic compositions using the t-distributed stochasticneighbor embedding map allowed the quick and comprehensive assessment of the local clustering behavior of UTS in orderto locate particular composition pools for desired UTS. Alloy pools expected to have UTS higher than 750 MPa were identifiedinto three composition groups. These alloy groups revealed relatively high content of Zn and Mg, and were designed soas to obtain extra-enhancement of UTS by adding Mn or Cr."

This suggests that machine learning can accurately identify even those factors perceived as less significant. The lower performance observed in FFT and PCA pre-processing models is attributed to the low sampling rate. In contrast, the data augmentation model, trained with the same row count as the FFT and PCA pre-processing model, exhibited superior accuracy, emphasizing the potential of low sampling rate sensors for precise long-term fault diagnosis.

These results indicate that models that encompass ESG data consistently outperform models that do not encompass ESG data in terms of predicting future corporate value. This paper is characterized by its use of an interdisciplinary research methodology that uniquely introduces machine learning techniques, which are rarely used for empirical analysis in the financial and accounting fields. This innovative and futureoriented research method is expected to inspire subsequent scholars in these domains and others in which machine learning techniques are not typically used."
V2V 통신 환경에서 DoS 공격 탐지 모델 개발을 위한 데이터 생성 및 검증,2024,"['Self-Driving Car', 'VANET', 'Denial of Serveice', 'Dataset', 'Machine-learning']",,"In recent years, autonomous vehicles have been using deep learning to recognize road conditions and make driving decisions. In addition, autonomous driving that uses only deep learning technology has limitations, so it utilizes vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) communications. However, VANET communications contains vulnerabilities that can be exposed to cyber-attacks such as denial of service (DoS), and research is underway to defend against them. In this paper, we generate a dataset to develop a machine learning model that can detect DoS attacks in the V2V communications environment of VANETs. The dataset is generated using simulation tools, such as OMNeT++, SUMO, Veins, and INET, to reflect the attributes of V2V communications and characteristics of the attacks. In addition, the attack dataset generated is validated to see if attacks can be detected by various machine learning models. The evaluation results show that the generated dataset can detect DoS attacks with an accuracy of about 97% or higher from most of the trained machine learning models, which is useful for training intrusion detection models."

Martensite start temperature (Ms), transformation temperature for martensite 50 vol.% (M50), and transformation temperature for martensite 90 vol.% (M90) are important transformation temperatures to control the martensite phase fraction. Several researchers proposed empirical equations and machine learning models to predict the Ms temperature. These numerical approaches can easily predict the Ms temperature without additional experiment and cost. However, to control martensite phase fraction more precisely, we need to reduce prediction error of the Ms model and propose prediction models for other martensite transformation temperatures (M50, M90). In the present study, machine learning model was applied to suggest the predictive model for the Ms, M50, M90 temperatures. To explain prediction mechanisms and suggest feature importance on martensite transformation temperature of machine learning models, the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is employed. Random forest regression (RFR) showed the best performance for predicting the Ms, M50, M90 temperatures using different machine learning models. The feature importance was proposed and the prediction mechanisms were discussed by XAI."

However, their centralized nature often poses challenges when dealing with distributed, decentralized, and private data sources. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a paradigm allowing distributed learning without compromising privacy. Nevertheless, porting ensemble methods like random forests into the federated environment introduces unique challenges, especially in handling non-IID data distributions. This study presents a federated random forest approach that employs a novel ensemble construction method. Rather than growing trees independently in each client, our approach ensures each decision tree in the ensemble is iteratively and collectively constructed across clients. After this, the clients adjust the leaf nodes of each tree, and a global server aggregates these updates across clients. This strategy allows the ensemble to better reflect the data's heterogeneity across different clients, enhancing its performance on non-IID data. Furthermore, we show that the proposed federated random forest method inherently facilitates incremental learning, effectively addressing the dynamic expansion of the federation, which allows the update of the existing ensemble model by seamlessly integrating data from newly participating clients without full retraining. This method maintained high performance with reduced complexity, as our experimental results confirmed."

The training and testing dataset comprises data from 52 confirmed, well preserved, and moderately eroded impact craters and a recently discovered impact crater in Korea, Jeokjung Chogye Basin (JCB). The morphometric parameters including rim diameter, floor diameter, and wall width of complex craters and simple craters were tested by Mann Whitney U test and One Sample Wilcoxon signed rank test. The tests showed that those parameters can statistically separate the two types of craters. The Random Forest model classified them with an accuracy of 88.6% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.67, where rim diameter, floor diameter, and wall width were identified as variables with the highest Gini indices. Complex craters are characterized by a large flat diameter and wide wall width compared to simple craters with parabolic bases. The difference is caused by the impact energy when the craters were formed. The study confirmed that using machine learning, the complex craters and simple craters can be separated by checking the SRTM elevation model with machine learning methods. The morphometric parameters of JCB impact crater indicated that the crater is highly a complex crater concluded by both statistical tests and machine learning algorithm."

In Section 2, sentences containing the target MWEs were extracted from a 2-billion-word corpus, and a sample of 14,189 sentences was selected for analysis. The sense of each sentence was manually annotated, and the sentences were morphologically analyzed using a morphological analyzer. In Section 3, the basic concept of TF-IDF is introduced, and the top TF-IDF morphemes for the 7 senses of the target MWEs are examined. In Section 4, the process and results of machine learning on the 14,189 sentences are discussed. It was found that using the top 300 TF-IDF morphemes and the 7 morphemes on either side of the core noun of the MWE as the search span was the most appropriate in terms of machine learning performance and processing speed. It was also found that including grammatical morphemes such as josa and eomi, rather than treating them as stopwords, resulted in a higher F1 score. Additionally, incorporating the grammatical structure of the MWEs (whether they are predicative or modifying) as a feature slightly improved the learning performance. Finally, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model was used for the machine learning, and after tuning, an F1 score of 0.8780 was achieved on the evaluation data."

To address the limitations of the PINN, especially concerning resolution for nonlinear problems, the Physical-Informed Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) is introduced in this paper. The Physics-Informed DeepONet is a deep learning framework crafted to discern solution operators for any given PDEs, even in scenarios lacking paired input/output training data. The proposed framework is able to predict solutions for various types of parameterized PDEs much faster than conventional PDE solvers. Several cases confirm that this approach is effective in establishing previously unexplored paradigms for modeling/simulating nonlinear and non-equilibrium processes in science and engineering."

Tokamak plasma disruption precursor onset time study based on semi-supervised anomaly detection,2024,"['Tokamak', 'Disruption prediction', 'Machine learning', 'Anomaly detection', 'Precursor onset time']",,"Plasma disruption in tokamak experiments is a challenging issue that causes damage to the device. Reliable prediction methods are needed, but the lack of full understanding of plasma disruption limits the effectiveness of physics-driven methods. Data-driven methods based on supervised learning are commonly used, and they rely on labelled training data. However, manual labelling of disruption precursors is a time-consuming and challenging task, as some precursors are difficult to accurately identify. The mainstream labelling methods assume that the precursor onset occurs at a fixed time before disruption, which leads to mislabeled samples and suboptimal prediction performance. In this paper, we present disruption prediction methods based on anomaly detection to address these issues, demonstrating good prediction performance on J-TEXT and EAST. By evaluating precursor onset times using different anomaly detection algorithms, it is found that labelling methods can be improved since the onset times of different shots are not necessarily the same. The study optimizes precursor labelling using the onset times inferred by the anomaly detection predictor and test the optimized labels on supervised learning disruption predictors. The results on J-TEXT and EAST show that the models trained on the optimized labels outperform those trained on fixed onset time labels."

Analyzing the vast amount of files present in a system can be time-consuming and costly. This study proposes a method to identify suspicious files using natural language processing techniques based solely on file paths. To achieve this, the study utilizes the New Technology File System (NTFS) Master File Table (MFT) to obtain paths for all files in the Windows file system. The file paths are converted into vectors that capture their structural characteristics using a word embedding model, which is commonly used in natural language processing. These vectors are then compared using machine learning techniques to classify abnormal file paths.

In general, retail districts have been established from the perspective of usage such as the demand of customers and the supply of retailers. Conversely, this study focused on the transaction of real estate and drew implications by comparing these two approaches. This study analyzed statistics of real estate transaction in Seoul using the spatial fuzzy C-means algorithm which is a spatial clustering technique based on machine learning and compared the results with the generally accepted retail districts stemmed from the perspective of usage. The comparison indicates that: First, the transaction-based approach distinguished core and neighboring retail districts successfully, and the locations of the core retail districts were similar to those of the usage-based approach. Therefore, retail districts could be reliably established using transaction data. Second, despite the similarity in the locations, significant differences were found between the boundaries of the retail districts according to the two approaches. Furthermore, the spatial changes over time, such as the expansion or contraction of retail districts, were identified from the differences. Third, the increase in the prices of retail districts focusing on the transaction was significantly larger than that of retail districts focusing on the usage. This difference indicates that statistical bias in the retail market can occur depending on whether the regionalization is based on usage or transaction."

However, inclusivity is ambiguous and has different meanings in different fields. Therefore, this study analyzes the trends and characteristics of research on inclusivity to understand the context and thematic awareness in the research field, and how researchers understand and utilize inclusivity. In particular, machine learning techniques were applied, such as topic modeling analysis and K-Means++, to conduct a quantitative and objective analysis. As a result of the analysis, the trend of research on inclusivity can be divided into three periods: the first period (2001-2010), when policy discussions were concentrated; the second period (2011-2014), when various research fields such as society, policy, culture, and economics were diversified and developed; and the third period (2015-present), when inclusivity research has rapidly increased and has been firmly established as an independent research field. Next, through topic modeling analysis using machine learning, we found that research on inclusivity is composed of seven topics: 'Regional and urban,' 'Financial and digital technology,' 'Organizational leadership,' 'Education and culture,' 'Civic community,' 'North-South reunification,' and 'Economic growth and welfare.' Of these, the Civic Community topic accounted for the largest proportion. Finally, K-Means++ analysis determined each topic comprising a 'social inclusivity' cluster, a 'policy' cluster, and a 'subtopic' cluster. The conclusions revealed that the social inclusion perspective is the most dominant, that policy content, not just civic engagement and inclusive cities, is important to realize inclusion, and that research on inclusion is developing as a diverse topic influenced by political and social changes."

How Do Fluctuations in Raw Material Prices Affect the Final Product Prices? Can This Be Predicted Utilizing AI Models?,2024,"['Agricultural Product Prices', 'Machine Learning', 'ARIMA', 'VAR', 'LSTM', '농산물 가격', '머신러닝', 'ARIMA', 'VAR', 'LSTM']",,"Globally, prices are soaring, and among these, agricultural product prices are experiencing significant increases. Agricultural products are essential for human survival and have a direct impact, making this a highly sensitive issue. This problem has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war, leading to even greater price hikes. Consequently, this situation places a considerable burden not only on consumers but also on the companies that process and produce these agricultural products. In particular, South Korea, a country with a high dependency on imports, relies on foreign markets for many agricultural products. However, despite this reliance, there is a lack of research on predicting the prices of imported agricultural products. For this reason, this study implements an AI model that predicts the retail prices of final products based on fluctuations in the prices of imported agricultural products, focusing on key research questions (RQs) and the distribution process. In addition, it examines the impact of global issues such as supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19 and the Ukraine-Russia war on price inflation.In this study, the top three imported agricultural products―corn, wheat, and soybeans―are selected as key imported agricultural items, and the prediction model is implemented focusing on the processed foods most commonly consumed in daily life that are manufactured from these products. At this time, key variables are added by taking into account the distribution and manufacturing processes involved in the processing of agricultural products.Specifically, the relationships between these variables are analyzed through correlation analysis, and a prediction model is implemented using big data analysis to select the model with the highest prediction accuracy. In this study, the VAR model showed the highest prediction accuracy among machine learning models, while the LSTM model demonstrated the highest accuracy among deep learning models.In conclusion, the academic implications of this study demonstrate that the impact of the international commodity market and global trade on the production and distribution of domestic companies can be scientifically analyzed and proposed through AI models. Additionally, the study systematically identified and explained the raw material supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic from an academic perspective. Furthermore, the practical implications of this study for companies are significant. By utilizing this research, companies can identify how price fluctuations in imported agricultural products affect the pricing of final products. It allows them to proactively respond to changes in the prices of final products by applying the forecasting model. Additionally, companies can confirm the relationship between the prices of imported agricultural products and the retail prices of final products, gaining a clearer understanding of the costs incurred during domestic and international distribution processes. It can be used to drive innovations in the distribution structure."

Comparison of the performance of various kernels for the survival prediction model,2024,"['kernel function', 'support vector machine', 'Cox model', 'accelerated failure model', 'C-index']",,"With the development of high-throughput technologies for producing genomic data, more advanced statistical methods such as regularization and machine learning techniques have been adapted to survival analysis. However, the clinical information such as age, gender and medical history plays a critical role in constructing a survival prediction model. Machine learning technique such as the support vector machine (SVM) can improve the predictability of the survival model by using the available clinical information. When implementing SVM for a predictive survival model, the clinical kernel was proposed by Daemen \textit{et al}. by equalizing the influence of clinical variables and taking account of the range of these variables. However, this clinical kernel uses the same weight for all clinical variables without considering the different effect of those variables on the survival time. In this study, we proposed a simple kernel, called ensemble kernel, by combining a clinical kernel with model fitting.  Since the proposed ensemble kernel is based on model fitting, two different kernels are considered by using either Cox model or accelerated failure time (AFT) model. We compare the performance of these two ensemble kernels with that of the linear kernel and the clinical kernel by the concordance index (C-index) using the four real data sets. While both linear and clinical kernels use all clinical variables in defining global kernels, the proposed two ensemble kernels can use only significant variables from either a Cox model or an AFT model. The comparative result shows that the proposed two ensemble kernels perform similarly as the existing clinical kernel does and the performance of four kernels vary according to data sets."

모형 기반의 농업분야 기후변화 취약성 평가 방법론 제안: APEX 모형과 회귀모형을 연계한 농경지 양분유출 평가를 중심으로,2024,"['SSP Scenario', 'Nitrogen', 'Phosphorus', 'Process-based Model', 'Machine Learning Model']",,"Scientific, evidence-based vulnerability assessments are vital for predicting and mitigating the climate change risks poses to national systems. This study proposes a climate change vulnerability assessment method by combining a process-based model and machine learning, using nutrient runoff vulnerability in agricultural land as an example. A training dataset was generated using the process-based model APEX (Agricultural Policy and Environmental eXtender) to train a nonlinear regression machine learning model. The trained nonlinear regression model accurately replicated the APEX results, with an R² value of 0.53 for nitrogen in paddy, and 0.72 for nitrogen and 0.71 for phosphorus in upland. This model was then applied to quantify nitrogen and phosphorus discharge at the si (city) and gun (county) levels. The results for each indicator were normalized, and weights were assigned using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Vulnerability assessments were then conducted for mid-term (2041 ~ 2070) and long-term (2071 ~ 2100) future scenarios, and compared with the baseline period (1981 ~ 2010). The results showed that the average nutrient discharge vulnerability score for si and gun units was 31.4 in the baseline period, with a minimum of 0.6 and a maximum of 70.0. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the average score increased to 43.6 in the mid-term future and 54.7 in the long-term future. However, when scenarios of compliance with standard fertilization rates for paddy and a 20% reduction in fertilization rates for upland were applied, the average score dropped to 33.3 in the mid-term future and 44.5 in the long-term future. These results highlight potential policy measures to mitigate the increasing vulnerability due to climate change in the agricultural sector and provide a rapid reference for policymakers when designing effective adaptation strategies."

Estimating Wind Shear Magnitude Near Runways at Hong Kong International Airport Using an Interpretable Local Cascade Ensemble Strategy,2024,['Wind shear · Airport runway · Civil Aviation Safety · Machine learning'],,"The elevated occurrence rate of wind shear (WS) events near airport runways presents one of the major hazards to the safe and efficient operation of landing and takeoff procedures. As a consequence of this, aircraft are more likely to experience the possibility of losing control or encountering hindrances. Hence, it is crucial to assess the factors influencing wind shear occurrence.Previous studies extensively reported the susceptibility of the runways at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) to significant wind shear events. Therefore, in order to estimate WS magnitude near runways at HKIA and assess various contributing factors, this study presents a novel Local Cascade Ensemble (LCE) model with its hyperparameters optimized via a Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to estimate the wind shear magnitude. The pilot report data obtained from HKIA between 2017 and 2021 was employed for the training and evaluation of the TPE-tuned LCE model. The outcomes of the TPE-tuned LCE model were also compared to those of other contemporary machine learning (ML) models. The findings indicated that the TPE-tuned LCE model exhibited better predictive performance in comparison to other models, as assessed by a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.38 knots, a mean squared error (MSE) of 70.28 knots, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 8.38 knots, and coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.79. Subsequently, model interpretation via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique was performed on the outcomes of TPE-tuned LCE. It indicated that that certain runways at HKIA, such as runway 07 C, 07 L, 25 C, and 25R, had a higher likelihood of experiencing elevated wind shear conditions within 1000 ft above the runway level."

Method After collecting and refining daily game data using the pybaseball package, we proceeded to predict hitting outcomes using various machine learning algorithms. Subsequently, we utilized SHAP to explore important variables. Based on this analysis, we defined a new batter evaluation metric. Results Using ball placement instead of launch angle, as with the traditional Barrel metric, resulted in a higher batting average. While the slugging percentage was generally lower for the newly defined hits compared to Barrel hits, the batting average was up to 5 points higher on maximum and averaged 2 points higher. Conclusion Based on these research findings, players can contribute more clearly to the team's offensive strategy by shifting their focus from launch angles, which are difficult to control, to a more strategic aspect of ball placement. Therefore, this study proposes a paradigm shift in batter evaluation and suggests new metrics that prioritize ball placement."

Interlayer Shear Strength (ISS) is recognized as an indicator quantifying the interface bonding quality. Consequently, accurate evaluation and prediction of the ISS is imperative in determining the performance of asphalt pavement structures. By conducting laboratory experiments and employing machine learning (ML) techniques, this research aims to predict and assess the ISS in asphalt pavement. In this regard, the classification and regression trees (CART) model was proposed based on measured data collected from laboratory experiments. Three experimental factors of curing temperature, normal stress, and tack coat application rate were selected as variables. The findings showed that the developed CART model explained over 98% of the experimental data in a relatively short period. The curing temperature was found to have the most significant influence on the ISS, followed by normal stress and tack coat dosage. Moreover, a parametric analysis of the interaction effects of input parameters on the ISS revealed that higher curing temperature and lower normal stress reduced the ISS. In contrast, a high tack coat application rate and low normal stress corresponded to a lower ISS of the asphalt pavement. The outcomes of this study could pave the way for the realization of a reliable and efficient design of interlayer bonding between asphalt pavement layers."

However, pepper cultivation is constrained by various viruses. Especially, Fusarium wilt is an economic problem threatening pepper production in many countries. The peppers were transplanted on May 2, and the multispectral images were taken on June 28, July 27, and August 26. There were 30 sampling points to measure the vegetation of pepper, but Fusarium wilt infection was confirmed in 15 samples on July 27 and 11 samples on August 25. Therefore, the possibility of Fusarium wilt detection on July 27 and August 25 was confirmed using the multispectral image taken on June 28 and July 27. It was possible to build models for detecting infected peppers using machine learning (KNN; K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM; Support Vector Machine, LR; Logistic Regression) and applying backward elimination to remove the 9 VIs ranked via correlation analysis with the ratio of train and test as 8:2, 7:3, and 6:4. In the case of the disease detection on July 27 using the image of June 28, the KNN model with 8 Vis was selected as the best model with a 7:3 ratio. However, the LR model with NDRE was chosen as the best model for disease detection on July 27 and August 25 using the images of June 28 and July 27 with a 8:2 ratio.The performance of the model which excluded the non-infected samples on August 25 was the best with DVI, TCARI, and RVI as 0.783, 0.733, 0.917, and 0.815 for the calibration and 0.909, 0.833, 1.000, and 0.909 for the validation in order of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Although two-wheelers are economically efficient in congested traffic conditions, reckless driving and ambiguous traffic laws for two-wheelers have turned two-wheeler accidents into a significant social issue. Given the high fatality rate associated with two-wheelers, the severity and risk of two-wheeler accidents are considerable. It is, therefore, crucial to thoroughly understand the characteristics of two-wheeler accidents by analyzing their attributes. In this study, the characteristics of two-wheeled vehicle accidents were categorized using the K-prototypes algorithm, based on data from two-wheeled vehicle accidents. As a result, the accidents were divided into four clusters according to their characteristics. Each cluster showed distinct traits in terms of the roads where accidents occurred, the major laws violated, the types of accidents, and the times of accident occurrences. By tailoring enforcement methods and regulations to the specific characteristics of each type of accident, we can reduce the incidence of accidents involving two-wheelers in metropolitan areas, thereby enhancing road safety. Furthermore, by applying machine learning techniques to urban transportation and safety, this study adds to the body of related literature."
기계학습을 이용한 의료폐기물 소각로의 COVID-19 전-후 운전특성 분석,2024,"['Medical Waste Incinerator', 'COVID-19', 'Machine Learning']",,"In Korea, medical waste is placed in special containers and disposed of separately, and it is impossible to open it or analyze its calorific value before incineration. Due to these characteristics, difficulties are arising in the operation of incinerators exclusively for medical waste due to the characteristics of incinerators whose operating conditions are determined based on the calorific value of the waste. In addition, since incinerators require continuous optimization of operating conditions as equipment ages, operation optimization through prediction of operating conditions is necessary.  In this study, the incinerator operation characteristics were analyzed using a Neural Network machine learning model using TMS data from a 20-ton/day commercial medical waste incinerator. In order to exclude abnormal operation conditions such as during the overhaul period, operation data was acquired at points where the combustion chamber temperature was above 850℃, and after learning this, correlation analysis between variables and accuracy of prediction data were analyzed. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that after COVID-19, a strong correlation occurred between variables related to combustion conditions (O2, exhaust gas flow rate, combustion chamber temperature, and combustion exhaust gas flow rate) that were not observed before COVID-19. In the before and after COVID-19 variable prediction results, it was confirmed that the exhaust gas flowrate prediction interval was expanded and the O2 concentration cluster formation trend changed significantly. In summary, it was confirmed that significant changes in incinerator operation characteristics occurred before and after the COVID-19 pandemic due to the high calorific value of COVID-19 medical waste and the same-day-discharge same-day incineration principle."

While existing studies have primarily focused on predicting the onset of go-arounds, relatively little attention has been paid to evaluating aircraft stability and performance after a go-around has been initiated. This study aims to address this gap by systematically assessing the dynamic response and stability of aircraft following a go-around using Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. The methodology involves classifying go-around events into 'near-ground' and 'at-altitude' categories, and analyzing changes in pitch, descent rate, engine performance, and environmental factors after the initiation of the go-around to evaluate its stability and efficiency. The XGBoost machine learning algorithm is employed to model the aircraft’s response post go-around and to predict stability across various go-around scenarios. The findings from this study provide insights that can enhance the safety and efficiency of go-around procedures through systematic analysis of QAR data, contributing to improvements in operational protocols and pilot training programs."

Real time character and speech commands recognition system,2024,"['Computer Vision', 'Character Recognition', 'Speech Recognition', 'Machine Learning system']",,"With the advancement of modern AI technology, the field of computer vision has made significant progress.This study introduces a parking management system that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and speech recognition technologies. When a vehicle enters the parking lot, the system recognizes the vehicle’ s license plate using OCR, while the administrator can issue simple voice commands to control the gate. OCR is a technology that digitizes characters by recognizing handwritten or image-based text through image scanning, enabling computers to process the text. The voice commands issued by the user are recognized using a machine learning model that analyzes spectrograms of voice signals. This allows the system to manage vehicle entry and exit records via voice commands, and automatically calculate paid services such as parking fees based on license plate recognition.The system identifies the text areas from images using a bounding box, converting them into digital characters to distinguish license plates. Additionally, the microphone collects the user's voice data, converting it into a spectrogram, which is used as input for a machine learning model to process 2D voice signal data.Based on the model’ s inference, the system controls the gate, either opening or closing it, while recording the time in real-time.This study introduces a parking management system that integrates OCR and a speech command recognition model. By training the model with multiple users' data, we aim to enhance its accuracy and offer a practical solution for parking management."

Voice data from the call center of a large Korean life insurance company was utilized to ascertain the positive and negative emotions of customers. It was found that positive emotions are closely related to insurance churn indicators. Therefore, the characteristics of consumers related to their emotional tendencies were quantified by using the data on whether they canceled their services as a proxy for positive emotions and applying machine learning techniques to analyze the attributes of canceled customers. The results indicate that consumers are more likely to cancel insurance services if they are older, female, married, have large assets, have low income, receive frequent contract counseling or new product offers, and have multiple products. These characteristics are indicative of a more negative emotional disposition. The significance of this study lies in its adoption of a quantitative paradigm beyond the traditional survey-based emotion assessment approach. From a practical perspective, it provides domestic insurance companies with reliable information on customer dispositions, which can be used to inform their customer retention strategies. Furthermore, the study offers insights that can be applied across various disciplines related to the analysis of individual emotions, including business, psychology, education, and sociology."

The patients were grouped as either the training (80%, n = 1,265) and test sets (20%, n = 236) depending on the time of referral. The conventional model (provocative concentration that causes a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]; PC20 ≤ 16 mg/mL) was compared with the prediction models derived from five ML methods: logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and artificial neural network. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curves (AUPRC) of each model were compared. The prediction models were further analyzed using different input combinations of FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow at 25%–75% of forced vital capacity (FEF25%–75%) values obtained during MCT.Results: In total, 545 patients (36.3%) were diagnosed with asthma. The AUROC of the conventional model was 0.856 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.852–0.861), and the AUPRC was 0.759 (95% CI, 0.751–0.766).

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection technique, we compare the performance of gender classification models before and after applying the proposed feature selection technique using a 3-D gait dataset available on the Internet. Eight machine learning algorithms applicable to binary classification problems were utilized in the experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed feature selection technique can reduce the number of features by 22, from 82 to 60, while maintaining the gender classification performance."

In particular, advanced technology for submarine torpedo counter measure tactics studies counter measure tactics according to changes in the performance of enemy torpedoes and decoy aircraft. In general, the speed of a torpedo is much faster than that of a submarine, so quick and accurate calculations are necessary because it is an emergency situation. Accordingly, in this paper, we apply reinforcement learning, one of the machine learning methods, to calculate enemy torpedo counter measure tactics that can respond to any situation and propose a torpedo counter measure tactic algorithm that can select an evasive course for the ship. We apply a reinforcement learning algorithm that can adapt to various variables that may occur in the maritime environment, and through this, we evaluate the excellence of the algorithm and present its applicability to torpedo counter measure tactics in an actual maritime environment."

Algorithms based on machine learning (ML) models learn complex structural behavior patterns from real-time data collected from sensors, which can provide basic information for evaluating the safety of structures. In this study, a technique for estimating member forces acting on members using strain measurements of a double-spiral fiber sensor system embedded in a carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tube using a fully connected neural network (FCNN) model was developed, and a method for applying this to major members such as offshore wind power support structures, foundation steel pipe piles, and steel pipe members of steel structural systems was proposed. A nonlinear 3D finite element program was used to create a numerical model in which a steel pipe and a CFRP double-spiral sensor system were combined, and the data obtained from the finite element analysis were input into the FCNN model to establish a nonlinear mapping relationship between the input (strain) and the output (member force). The performance of the model was verified through various evaluation indices such as R², MSE, and MAE, and it was confirmed that the proposed AI model showed excellent performance in data suitability and computational efficiency. This study presented an efficient and reliable technical solution for estimating member forces through the behavior of steel pipes using an AI method based on analysis data, and showed the possibility of expanding and applying AI to the structural design and maintenance fields by providing more intelligent tools and methods for SHM such as offshore wind power support structures."

However, a critical issue arises when acquired shares are not immediately destroyed but are strategically utilized for purposes like entrenching management control or influencing corporate governance, diverging from their intended use. These practices can potentially cause market confusion, yet there is a lack of sufficient research efforts to adequately monitor such activities or understand the implications and potential benefits of strategic treasury share utilization. This research adopts a machine learning approach to detect patterns in Korean corporations’ treasury share activities.

Among the various data collected for artificial intelligence learning, the proportion of unstructured data such as images, videos, and texts is increasing recently, and the need for personal information protection in collecting such unstructured data is strongly emerging.In particular, learning of generative artificial intelligence systems requires training to find the optimal way to do trial and error on its own while repeatedly testing various problem-solving methods, and as a result, much more data is needed compared to existing artificial intelligence systems. In this process, it became a problem that computers connected to the Internet randomly collect unstructured data such as all published images, videos, and texts and use them for training.The existing Personal Information Protection Act does not establish the infringement of the legal interests of the information subject by the collection of big data such as artificial intelligence itself, but imposes criminal responsibility, civil damage liability, and administrative responsibility to the personal information controller at the symmetry of the information subject. Therefore, as the amount of unstructured data collected under the artificial intelligence system increased dramatically, the priority was to resolve the gap in related laws and regulations to include unstructured data containing personal information into the Personal Information Protection Act. Accordingly, the Personal Information Protection Act was completely revised in March 2023 and has been gradually 2023 변호사(제56집) 348 implemented since September 2023. Under the revised Personal Information Protection Act, information on collecting unstructured data is 1) granting active rights to information subjects, such as the right of the data subject to automated decisions and the right to request personal information transmission, and 2) defining and regulating standards for unstructured data collection devices.What becomes important in terms of personal information protection with the development of artificial intelligence systems is that artificial intelligence service providers reflect technologies and policies that take into account user privacy from the planning stage when developing products and services. Therefore, it is necessary for the Personal Information Protection Act to move forward in a developmental direction, such as actively preparing pseudonymization standards for unstructured data for artificial intelligence learning, preparing sanctions for big tech companies for the transfer of personal information abroad, and promoting cooperation with artificial intelligence service providers for legitimate unstructured data collection."

Comparative Analysis of Gradient-Boosting Ensembles for Estimation of Compressive Strength of Quaternary Blend Concrete,2024,"['Compressive strength', 'Quaternary blend concrete', 'Gradient-boosting algorithms', 'Ensemble machine learning']",,"Concrete compressive strength is usually determined 28 days after casting via crushing of samples. However, the design strength may not be achieved after this time-consuming and tedious process. While the use of machine learning (ML) and other computational intelligence methods have become increasingly common in recent years, findings from pertinent literatures show that the gradient-boosting ensemble models mostly outperform comparative methods while also allowing interpretable model. Contrary to comparison with other model types that has dominated existing studies, this study centres on a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance of four widely used gradient-boosting ensemble implementations [namely, gradient-boosting regressor, light gradient-boosting model (LightGBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and CatBoost] for estimation of the compressive strength of quaternary blend concrete. Given components of cement, Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), Fly Ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate in addition to the age of each concrete mixture as input features, the performance of each model based on R2, RMSE, MAPE and MAE across varying training–test ratios generally show a decreasing trend in model performance as test partition increases. Overall, the test results showed that CatBoost outperformed the other models with R2, RMSE, MAE and MAPE values of 0.9838, 2.0709, 1.5966 and 0.0629, respectively, with further statistical analysis showing the significance of these results. Although the age of each concrete mixture was found to be the most important input feature for all four boosting models, sensitivity analysis of each model shows that the compressive strength of the mixtures does increase significantly after 100 days. Finally, a comparison of the performance with results from different ML-based methods in pertinent literature further shows the superiority of CatBoost over reported the methods."

Predicting Dyeing Properties and Light Fastness Rating of Recycled PET by Artificial Neural Network,2024,"['Recycled PET', 'Automotive interior', 'Disperse dyes', 'Light fastness', 'Artificial neural network (ANN)', 'Machine learning']",,"Global car manufacturers have been actively exploring strategies to incorporate eco-friendly fiber materials into automotive interiors, with a particular focus on replacing traditional PET (polyethylene terephthalate) fabrics with recycled PET. Light fastness stands out as one of the most crucial features for fabrics utilized in automobile interiors, especially when exposed to sunlight. This is because the interior temperature of a vehicle subjected to sunlight can escalate rapidly, accelerating dye fading due to degradation caused by UV (ultraviolet) radiation. In this study, we undertook the dyeing of recycled PET by adjusting the concentration of anthraquinone-based dispersion dye, renowned for its exceptional light fastness, alongside varying the concentration of a light fastness enhancer. Subsequently, leveraging the dyeing data obtained from the fabric, we developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a machine learning model. This model facilitates the computation of dyeing properties both before and after light fastness tests, enabling the prediction of color differences and light fastness ratings. The generated model underwent training and optimization, achieving R2 values exceeding 0.98 for all dependent variables. To verify the model’s accuracy, computations were conducted on data not included in the dataset. The outcomes indicated that the model could predict dyeing qualities with an average absolute error of approximately 6% compared to the actual values."

However, the extent to which HCBs will be stimulated in the future due to increased temperature remains uncertain. This study aims to predict the future occurrence of cyanobacteria in the Nakdong River, which has the highest incidence of HCBs in South Korea, based on temperature rise scenarios. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were used as the basis for these scenarios. Data-driven model simulations were conducted, and out of the four machine learning techniques tested (multiple linear regression, support vector regressor, decision tree, and random forest), the random forest model was selected for its relatively high prediction accuracy. The random forest model was used to predict the occurrence of cyanobacteria. The results of boxplot and time-series analyses showed that under the worst-case scenario (RCP8.5 (2100)), where temperature increases significantly, cyanobacterial abundance across all study areas was greatly stimulated. The study also found that the frequencies of HCB occurrences exceeding certain thresholds (100,000 and 1,000,000 cells/mL) increased under both the best-case scenario (RCP2.6 (2050)) and worst-case scenario (RCP8.5 (2100)). These findings suggest that the frequency of HCB occurrences surpassing a certain threshold level can serve as a useful diagnostic indicator of vulnerability to temperature increases caused by climate change. Additionally, this study highlights that water bodies currently susceptible to HCBs are likely to become even more vulnerable with climate change compared to those that are currently less susceptible."

Signals from rotating and non-rotating equipment included in the Malfunctioning Industrial Machine Investigation and Inspection (MIMII) dataset were applied to a deep learning model. We applied unsupervised learning methods utilizing the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Domain Adaptation Neural Network (DANN). First, VAEs were utilized to diagnose the fault. The statistical features of the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) coefficients of the acoustic signal were utilized to extract features that can be used regardless of the length of the audio signal. Considering the characteristics of rotating equipment, feature enhancement was performed by applying Magnitude Spectral Subtraction and feature lightweight, and data augmentation was performed by utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on the extracted features. Although VAE can create a fault classifier using only steady-state data, improving and augmenting the features was necessary considering the characteristics of non-rotating and rotating equipment. The increased ambient noise reduced the accuracy, showing that VAE can accurately diagnose failures. The data used for training contains a domain shift between the laboratory environment and the actual operating environment, which represents a problem where a fault classifier trained on data from the laboratory environment may have poor diagnostic performance in the real world. To solve this problem, a Domain Adaptive Neural Network (DANN) was applied. DANN does not require additional data processing and can utilize labels from the source domain to diagnose faults in the target domain. By utilizing the advantages of the above two methods, we showed that fault diagnosis can be adapted even if the environment of a given equipment changes by combining the procedures according to the noise situation."

As the use of lightweight materials such as aluminum and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) increases in the automotive industry, ensuring joint integrity has become critical. Two material combinations were analyzed: CFRP with aluminum vibration damping sheets and galvanized steel (SGACEN) with aluminum vibration damping sheets.

Based on data collected from experimental farms at Sunchon National University and Suncheon Bay cucumber farms, we constructed and compared the performance of models using three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The models were trained using 19 environmental and growth-related variables, including temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration. The LightGBM model showed the best performance (RMSE: 1.9803, R-squared: 0.5891). However, all models had R-squared values below 0.6, indicating limitations in capturing data nonlinearity and temporal dependencies. The study identified key factors influencing cucumber fruit set prediction through feature importance analysis. Future research should focus on collecting additional data, applying complex feature engineering, introducing time series analysis techniques, and considering data augmentation and normalization to improve model performance. This study contributes to the practical application of smart farm technology and the development of data-driven agricultural decision support systems."

Ohwi, Humulus japonicus Siebold & Zucc.., which influence the vegetation landscape and plant growth of large-area natural heritage sites, and the results are as follows.First, when building hyper-spectral libraries, an acquisition technique was presented that takes into account the shape of the measurement object, the material and color of the measurement background, and the measurement distance. In case of acquisition, the front and back sides of the leaves and branches, which are similar to the crown of the plant seen in the aerial hyper-spectral image, are mixed and placed against a black fabric background. In addition, the shooting distance, among a whiteboard for reflection value correction is used, the plant and the equipment, is 10cm was effective, considering equipment specification and external environment condition. Second, through variance analysis and machine learning of the three acquired spectral libraries, it was revealed that they had discriminatory power compared to the spectral libraries of the four comparative plants. As a result of analysis of Robinia pseudoacacia L., Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, using RF(Random Forest) and SVM (Support Vector Machine), discrimination was found with a low error rate of 8-12%, suggesting the possibility of using them as a spectral library in the future. In particular, Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi showed the most significant difference from comparison plants in all wavelength bands. On the other hand, Humulus japonicus Siebold & Zucc.. showed the highest error rate in RF classification, excluding specific wavelength bands, and no consistent trend was found.In order to derive the spectral value of the other vine, which distinguishes it from other plants, it seems necessary to develop an index through band calculation of two or more wavelength. This study has limitations in that it was limited to three species of hazardous plants. Therefore, in the future, various types of spectral libraries should be built according to the growth period of plants, and advanced research should be conducted to monitor the growth environment and detect damage from harmful plants in large-area natural heritage sites using aerial hyper-spectral images."

This suggests that the contribution of foreign factors to changes in domestic long-term interest rates has increased as international interest rates have become more synchronized due to the Fed's quantitative easing policy and global capital mobility. We also analyzed the partial effects of individual variables on long-term interest rates and found that the U.S. long-term interest rate has the highest explanatory power.

To achieve the targeted surface roughness in mold machining, it typically relies on the utilization of cutting models for predicting cutting forces and experimental studies to optimize machining conditions. Because it is difficult to intuitively deduce the correlation between cutting variables and actual surface roughness, experiments are necessary in various machining conditions to adapt to changing machining environments. Furthermore, in micro-machining environments like in this study, various factors such as the difficulty of detecting micro-cutting signals, the lack of established standard models for predicting micro-cutting forces, and increased machining costs make it challenging to secure surface roughness through interpretation models and experiments. Moreover, although the trend of utilizing artificial intelligence in industries is increasing, there exist limitations in applying the technology due to the extensive time, manpower, and costs involved in collecting high-quality data for constructing artificial neural networks. In this study, to overcome these limitations and supplement experimental data necessary for AI learning, a neural network conversion model was proposed to convert surface roughness prediction equations into experimental data. Then, by using the converted formula data as similar-experimental data along with actual experimental data, an artificial neural network model for predicting surface roughness was constructed. The predicted surface roughness data obtained through the proposed method was compared and analyzed against actual surface roughness data. As a result, the prediction model incorporating similar-experimental data achieved an accuracy improvement of over 36% compared to models using only experimental data.

However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of the echo signal due to multipath propagation of the signal, various clutter, ambient noise and reverberation makes it difficult to identify underwater targets using active sonar. Attempts have been made to apply data-based methods such as machine learning or deep learning to improve the performance of underwater target recognition systems, but it is difficult to collect enough data for training due to the nature of sonar datasets. Methods based on mathematical modeling have been mainly used to compensate for insufficient active sonar data. However, methodologies based on mathematical modeling have limitations in accurately simulating complex underwater phenomena. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a sonar signal synthesis method based on a deep neural network. In order to apply the neural network model to the field of sonar signal synthesis, the proposed method appropriately corrects the attention-based encoder and decoder to the sonar signal, which is the main module of the Tacotron model mainly used in the field of speech synthesis.

Because the machine structure operates for a long time, the investigation of the possibility of load learning using Long Short-Term Memory with a memory function for the short and long terms can have important implications for recognizing and predicting accidents and damage during the operation period. Depending on the size of the load, the data entered sequentially tended to be related to predictive accuracy, from relatively old low loads that required long-term memory to large loads that required new and short-term memory. Because the amount of data obtained by structural analysis is insufficient for learning Artificial Neural Networks, its usefulness was confirmed by investigating the possibility of utilizing the data that amplified the data calculated as a result of the structural analysis using the stacked autoencoder."
Leveraging distributed and parallel algorithm for normalized PCA in hyperspectral image analysis,2024,"['Hyperspectral Image Analysis', 'Normalization', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'MapReduce Algorithm', 'Dimensionality Reduction']",,"In recent years, the availability of hyperspectral data has rapidly expanded across diverse fields of study. These data, measured by hundreds of spectral bands, are characterized by high dimensionality, posing significant challenges for analysis. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely-used method for dimensionality reduction. However, sample principal components (PCs) are generally sensitive to difference in scale, and thus hyperspectral datasets with varying scales require proper normalization. Furthermore, the massive volume of hyperspectral data necessitates adopting distributed and parallel computing platforms. In this article, we propose a single-phase MapReduce-based algorithm for normalized PCA on large-scale high-dimensional hyperspectral data by leveraging the distributed and parallel architecture of RHadoop. Our experiment on the Indian Pines dataset underscores the substantial impact of the normalization process on PCA-based feature selection and subsequent machine learning analyses.

It is an inevitable and challenging issue and affects the detection performance of the sensor. A recently developed network model with a deep-learning scheme is considered as a promising solution to overcome such gas sensor drift problems. In this context, we present an improved multi-model ensemble network consisting of tabular data learning network (TabNet), support vector machine (SVM), and long short-term memory (LSTM). The proposed TabNet–SVM–LSTM (TSL) ensemble was implemented by employing a software-based approach for the gas sensor drift compensation without modifying hardware components. To validate the proposed TSL ensemble, a gas sensor drift dataset obtained from the UCI machine learning repository was considered. The dataset spans three years and comprises data from sixteen metal-oxide gas sensors monitoring six distinct volatile organic compounds under tightly controlled operational conditions. The extensive experiments showed that the TSL ensemble can adeptly manage sensor drift and outperform baseline competitive schemes for gas sensor drift compensation."

This study aimed to assess the potential possibility for the growth of Fagus spp. on the Korean mainland from a climatic perspective. To achieve this, the Maximum Entropy model analysis, machine learning among the species distribution models (SDM), was conducted. The analysis was conducted using four cases: Case1_Fm (focused solely on F. multinervis), Case2_Fmj (combining F. multinervis and F. japonica), Case3_Fmc (combining F. multinervis and F. crenata), Case4_Fmjc (combining all three species) and the type created by overlapping the analyses of each species (Case5_Ovlp). The results showed that Case1_Fm had almost no potential for growth on the Korean mainland, while Case2_Fmj to Case5_Ovlp indicated low growth potential in some areas along the east coast. The key environmental variables influencing growth were the maximum temperature of the warmest month (Bio5) and precipitation seasonality (Bio15). Additionally, using WorldClim's Bioclim environmental variables, the study analyzed the environmental characteristics of the entire South Korea, the east coast areas with potential growth, and the occurrence points of the three Fagus spp. Unlike the overall average in Korea, the east coast areas and F. multinervis occurrence points showed less seasonal temperature variation and lower precipitation variability, indicating weaker seasonality. The findings of this study are expected to serve as fundamental data for the cultivation of Fagus spp. as landscaping trees."

However, because it's nearly impossible to precisely estimate the lifespan ofeach building due to the wide range of influencing factors, most studies have used uniform lifespans based on the building's primarystructural type. To address this limitation, 1,812,700 records were analyzed of buildings constructed and demolished in Korea to predict eachbuilding's lifespan with greater accuracy. Based on the previous study, a prediction model was developed using both deep learning andtraditional machine learning methods. This study evaluated whether the building lifespan prediction model experienced overfitting based on thedata period used to create the model. A performance evaluation was also conducted, comparing models using only key factors to those usinga broader set of factors. The results showed that among the machine learning models, the artificial neural network model, a nonlinearapproach, maintained high predictive accuracy without overfitting, regardless of the data period used. The model that used all available factorsperformed better than those based on just a few key factors. This research demonstrates the viability of using big data and AI for buildinglifespan prediction, providing a more reliable method for estimating building lifespan tailored to each building's unique characteristics. Thisapproach meets a growing societal demand for more accurate building lifespan predictions."

Using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a topic modeling technique, this research examined a collection of writings from pre-service teachers enrolled in a constructivist-focused mathematics education course. The analysis identified key topics that emerged, changes in the prominence of these topics over time, and unique characteristics distinguishing the writing of pre-service mathematics teachers from their peers in other disciplines. The findings revealed that writing effectively captured the shifting priorities of pre-service teachers, such as their emphasis on teacher roles and learner-centered instruction. Variability in topic focus throughout the semester may reflect the influence of a changing educational context, particularly in remote or hybrid learning settings. These dynamic shifts underscore the interplay between the pre-service teachers' growing understanding and their evolving learning environments. This study contributes to the expanding literature on pre-service teacher development by demonstrating how machine learning techniques can complement traditional qualitative methods, offering deeper insights into their professional growth. The results suggest that integrating writing analysis into teacher education programs can enhance support for reflective practice and adaptive teaching strategies."
MicroPredict: predicting species-level taxonomic abundance of whole-shotgun metagenomic data using only 16S amplicon sequencing data,2024,['Microbiome · WGS sequencing · 16S rRNA sequencing · Prediction'],,"Background The importance of the human microbiome in the analysis of various diseases is emerging. The two main methods used to profile the human microbiome are 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S sequencing) and whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS). Owing to the full coverage of the genome in sequencing, WGS has multiple advantages over 16S sequencing, including higher taxonomic profiling resolution at the species-level and functional profiling analysis. However, 16S sequencing remains widely used because of its relatively low cost. Although WGS is the standard method for obtaining accurate species-level data, we found that 16S sequencing data contained rich information to predict high-resolution species-level abundances with reasonable accuracy.Objective In this study, we proposed MicroPredict, a method for accurately predicting WGS-comparable species-level abundance data using 16S taxonomic profile data.Methods We employed a mixed model using two key strategies: (1) modeling both sample- and species-specific information for predicting WGS abundances, and (2) accounting for the possible correlations among different species.Results We found that MicroPredict outperformed the other machine learning methods.Conclusion We expect that our approach will help researchers accurately approximate the species-level abundances of microbiome profiles in datasets for which only cost-effective 16S sequencing has been applied."

AI산업의 발전을 위해 무상 이용을 합법화하자는 주장과, 창작에 대한 인센티브 감소 등을 이유로 저작물이 함부로 이용되어서는 안 된다는 주장이다. 생성형 AI는 인간 저작물을 통한 학습을 토대로 문학적, 예술적 결과물을 훨씬 빠르고 저렴하게 제공하므로, 인간저작자는 대체될 수 있는 위험에 처해있다. 이와 같은 현실에서 창작자의 정신적 노력의 산물에 무임승차 하는 것을 ‘사회적 이익’이라는 이름으로 정당화할 수 있을 것인지에 대한 고민이 필요한 시점이다.이에 공정이용 법리의 적용이나 TDM 예외규정의 입법을 통한 저작물의 무상 이용정책보다는, 저작권자에 대한 적절한 보상방법을 강구함으로써 저작권자와 AI 개발자, 이용자 간 이익의 균형을 유지할 수 있는 본질적인 해결책이 필요하다고 본다. 본 논문에서는 AI 학습데이터로 저작물을 무단 이용하는 문제를 해결할 수 있는 새로운 해법으로 ‘확대된 집중관리제도(Extended Collective Licensing)’를 도입할 것과 블록체인기술을 활용한 저작권 거래 시스템을 확립할 것을 제언한다. 저작권 라이선싱은 저작권소유자에 대한 공정한 대우를 보장하고, AI 서비스를 사용하는 기업에 법적 안정성을 제공하며, 산업발전을 가속화 할 수 있는 효과적인 메커니즘이다. 특히 전 세계적으로 머신러닝 목적으로 사용되었거나 사용될 수 있는 저작물에는 수많은 저작권자들이 존재하기 때문에, 확대된 집중관리제도의 적용은 AI를 훈련하는 데 사용되는 저작물을 투명하게 관리하고 저작권법이 추구하는 정당한 대가를 분배하기 위한 AI 시대의 가장 논리적인 대응이라 할 수 있다.","Regarding the issue of using copyrighted works as training data, there are two conflicting claims. One is that free use should be legalized for the development of the AI industry, and the other is that copyrighted works should not be used without permission due to reducing incentives for creation. Generative AI provides literary and artistic outputs much faster and cheaper based on learning from human works, putting human authors at risk of being replaced. In this situation, it is time to consider whether it is reasonable to justify free riding on the works that the creator achieved with a great deal of effort in the name of ‘the social benefit’.Rather than applying fair use doctrine or legislating TDM exception, an substantial solution is required that can maintain the balance between copyright holders, AI developers, and users, such as finding appropriate rewards system. In this paper, I suggest to introduce ‘Extended Collective Licensing (ECL) System’ as a new solution to resolve problems caused by use of copyrighted works without permission and establish a copyright trading system based on blockchain technology. Copyright licensing is an effective mechanism to ensure legitimate rewards to copyright holders, provide legal stability to users and developers of AI services, and accelerate industrial development. Because there are numerous copyright holders worldwide for works that have been used or may be used for machine learning purposes, the adoption of an Extended Collective Licensing System can be said to be the most logical response in the AI era. This system will manage transparently copyrighted works used in AI machine learning and distribute fair compensation guaranteed by copyright law."

In order to apply such a scientific analysis technique, the quality and quantity of data are important, but when the amount of data is insufficient, it is very difficult to apply it to scientific methods such as machine learning and big data analysis. The amount of stock price data of newly listed companies is limited, and the lack of such data can cause problems such as underfitting and overfitting in learning machine learning and artificial neural network models. In this paper, Time-series Generative Adversarial Network (TimeGAN) was applied as a method to expand the stock price data of newly listed companies. TimeGAN provides an effective way to generate synthetic data similar to the real world by modeling the inherent temporal and dynamic characteristics of time series data. We used this model to expand the stock price data of newly listed companies in the Korean stock market from 2019 to 2023, and analyze the statistical effectiveness of the expanded data through PCA and t-SEN techniques, and found that the data generated through TimeGAN well preserves the statistical characteristics of the original data.

In this situation, the ability to accurately predict the possibility of personal credit loan default is becoming important, and this study aims to predict default using standardized credit information data. Various approaches have been attempted in personal credit loan default prediction research, from statistical methods to machine learning, and recently, deep learning methods such as multilayer perceptron have been applied. However, multilayer perceptron does not reflect contextual information between input variables, so it does not show improvement in prediction performance compared to existing machine learning methods. In this study, in order to overcome the shortcomings of the existing multilayer perceptron methodology, the Transformer methodology, which is mainly used in the natural language processing field, was applied to the problem of personal credit loan default prediction, and as a result, it was confirmed that it showed an improvement in prediction performance compared to the existing deep learning and showed the same level of prediction performance as the XGBoost methodology, an ensemble-based decision tree with the best prediction performance among previous methods. The implication of this study is that the Transformer methodology, which is mainly used in natural language processing, can be effective in the problem of predicting personal credit loan defaults using tabular data consisting of various variables. This suggests that, compared to existing traditional modeling techniques, Transformer can better capture complex interactions between high-dimensional data and improve prediction performance. This shows that the Transformer model has the potential to expand its application range in various prediction problems in the financial field."

Therefore, appropriate attention and safety measures are required to prevent serious accidents. This study employed machine learning methodologies, namely artificial neural network (ANN), to develop models for predicting port accident severity. Additionally, oversampling and clustering techniques were applied to augment data for all features of port accident data and to separate accident risk situations based on features. Consequently, a port accident severity model was developed using heterogeneous accident data clustered by features, and its performance was compared and analyzed against a severity model built on non-clustered accident data. Research findings indicate that accident models utilizing clustered data reflecting the heterogeneity of port accident data show better performance than accident models utilizing non-clustered data. Finally, to explain the machine learning model, the ANN model was used to perform explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) analysis and identify key variables influencing severe accidents in ports. This study introduces a high-performance and interpretable analytics model for assessing port accident severity, offering valuable insights for informed decision-making by experts. The findings of this study can play a crucial role in reducing accident severity within port terminals, promoting safety, and contributing to reducing economic losses caused by accidents in ports."

Emphasis was placed on the impact of various baking enhancers on the Mixolab thermo-mechanical properties of wheat flour and consequent alterations in bread texture. The application of baking enhancers positively contributed to dough formation and stability, producing bread with a soft texture. However, a relatively low Pearson correlation coefficient was observed between a single Mixolab parameter and bread texture (r<0.59). To more ac curately predict the texture of bread from the thermo-mechanical features of wheat flour with baking enhancers, five AI models (multiple linear regression, decision tree, stochastic gradient descent, random forest, and multilayer perceptron neural network) were applied, and their prediction performance was compared. The multilayer perceptron neural network model was further utilized to enhance the prediction of bread texture by mitigating overfitting risks. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning (activa tion function [Leaky ReLU], regularization [0.0001], and dropout [0.1]) led to enhanced model performance (R2 = 0.8109 and RMSE = 0.1096)."

Algorithms are problematic because they are secretive and opaque black boxes with little transparency; they operate on the basis of correlation rather than causation, and generate ""predictions"" rather than ""explanations""; their behavior can lack comprehensibility and predictability; and they can override traditional methods of cognition and perception, thus creating the need to control algorithmic decision-making systems.The discussion on the regulation of automated decision-making by privacy norms is based on the fact that the GDPR updates and extends the provisions of the DPD and the recent rapid development and use of artificial intelligence. Algorithmic transparency and accountability have recently been discussed in the U.S., where there is no general law on personal information, in connection with due process, and in Europe in connection with the GDPR, but many issues related to the right to explanation are still being discussed.Domestically, the Credit Information Act was amended by the amendment of the Data 3 Act to grant the right of explanation and objection to automated evaluation results (§36(2)). Although the contents of the Credit Information Act are virtually identical to those of the GDPR, it is limited to the financial sector centered on personal credit evaluation. In March 2023, the Personal Information Protection Act was amended to include a regulation on the rights of information subjects regarding automated decisions (§37(2)), which is almost identical to the GDPR.

We employ Harris corner detection to locate object positions from two types of data. Additionally, we generate reference points for extracting measurement values by utilizing features specific to each measurement area and exploiting the contrast in shading between the background and objects, thus reflecting the slope of each sample. Subsequently, we introduce a method using the Euclidean distance and correction coefficients to predict values, allowing for the prediction of measurements regardless of changes in the wires position. We achieve high accuracy for each measurement type, 99.1%, 98.7%, 92.6%, 92.5%, 99.9%, and 99.7%, achieving outstanding overall average accuracy of 97% across all measurements. This inspection method not only addresses the limitations of conventional visual inspections but also yields excellent results with a small amount of data.

However, such algorithms have yet to produce appropriate results when applied to Korean cultural heritage images, while the number of cases for such applications also remains insufficient. Accordingly, this study attempts to develop a style transfer algorithm that can be applied to styles found among Korean cultural heritage. The algorithm was produced by improving data comprehension by enabling it to learn meaningful characteristics of the styles through representation learning and to separate the cultural heritage from the background in the target images, allowing it to extract the style-relevant areas with the desired color and texture from the style images. This study confirmed that, by doing so, a new image can be created by effectively transferring the characteristics of the style image while maintaining the form of the target image, which thereby enables the transfer of a variety of cultural heritage styles."

Dropout 기법을 활용한 ANN 기반 태양광 발전량 예측 모델의  성능 비교,2024,"['Dropout', 'PV', 'Machine learning', 'Confidence interval']",,"This study investigates the effect of the Dropout technique on the generalizability of PV generation prediction models utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Using solar energy data from Daejeon, South Korea, covering 2017 to 2021, we developed three ANN-based predictive models with Dropout rates of 0%, 10%, and 20%. The Dropout method was implemented during the training phase to mitigate overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons in the network. The model with a 20% Dropout rate (Case 3) demonstrated the most consistent and reliable performance across various metrics. Although all models met the performance criteria based on CV(RMSE), those utilizing appropriate Dropout rates exhibited enhanced stability, particularly during specific timeframes. The results indicate that while Dropout effectively prevents overfitting and enhances prediction stability, variations in dropout rates do not necessarily lead to significant changes in overall model performance. This study highlights the importance of Dropout as a regularization technique within ANN frameworks and suggests further exploration of time-series analysis and other methods to improve solar power forecasting models."

The research analyzed the differences of these rhetorical elements in the most upvoted answers with random answers. A total of 193 answer pairs were randomly selected, with 135 pairs for training and 58 for testing. These answers were then coded in line with the rhetorical principles to refine GPT 3.5-based models. The models achieved F1 scores of .88 (ethos), .81 (pathos), and .69 (logos). Subsequent analysis of 128 new answer pairs revealed that logos, particularly factual information and logical reasoning, was more frequently used in the most upvoted answers than the random answers, whereas there were no differences in ethos and pathos between the answer groups. The results suggest that health information consumers value information including logos while ethos and pathos were not associated with consumers' preference for health information.

1차원 합성곱 오토인코더와 회귀 모델을 결합한 항공기 엔진의 잔여유효수명 예측,2024,"['Aircraft', 'Deep Learning', 'Predictive Maintenance', 'Remaining Useful Life']",,"Purpose: Aircraft engine failures contribute significantly to overall aircraft failures, making up approximately 60% of incidents. In intricate systems like aircraft, the failure of a single component can affect the entire system, thereby posing operational disruptions and safety hazards. Therefore, the accurate prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of aircraft engines is crucial for ensuring safety and optimizing operational efficiency.Methods: To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates a one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder (1D-CAE) and a regression model. The 1D-CAE is trained using sensor data collected from specific aircraft engines. Subsequently, sensor data from other engines undergo encoding through the trained 1D-CAE to extract hidden features. These features are then utilized to train a regression model. The combined use of the 1D-CAE’s encoder and the regression model enables the prediction of the RUL of aircraft engines.Results: Combined with the XGBoost regression model, the proposed approach demonstrated exceptional performance, as evidenced by a root mean squared error of 16.49. This approach outperformed conventional machine learning methodologies that did not incorporate the 1D-CAE.Additionally, our methodology exhibited superior performance compared to those reported in previous studies, resulting in an enhancement of approximately 6%.Conclusion: The integration of the 1D-CAE and regression model provides an effective means of predicting RUL and extends its applicability to diverse fields while mitigating risks and reducing costs associated with system failures."

Consequently, the prediction of ocean heatwaves in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula is becoming increasingly important for marine environmental monitoring and management. In this study, an LSTM model was developed to improve the underestimated prediction of ocean heatwaves caused by the coarse vertical grid system of the Korean Peninsula Ocean Prediction System.

Water stress level classification of sweet  potato using infrared thermal imaging and  plant growth indicators,2024,"['artificial intelligence (AI)', 'machine learning', 'sweet potato', 'water stress', 'yield']",,"Recently, sudden droughts and floods due to the average temperature increase have become frequent and have become an emerging issue worldwide. It has caused serious decline in agricultural yield and product quality. Also, even though sweet potato is well known for growing under harsh environment, its yield can be affected by abnormal climates. Therefore, the importance of water stress monitoring of sweet potatoes has drawn substantial attention.As a result, a lot of research is being conducted. Then, various water stress level monitoring techniques have been recently developed. Therefore, in the current study, a nondestructive evaluation technique has been suggested for the water stress level evaluation of field-grown sweet potatoes. To accomplish this, thermal imagery and support vector machine (SVM) tech- nique was used and a classifier for water stress evaluation (CSE) was developed. In addition, crop water stress index (CWSI) was derived from acquired thermal imagery and plat growth indices was used for developing the CSE. Consequently, the accuracy of the newly developed CSE was about 0.86. This study has demonstrated that CSE can be used to quantify water level stress and control the amount of irrigation water. Furthermore, based on the developed technique, the water stress level of different field-grown crops will be promising."

In this paper, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique to extract ten major topics related to interest rate increases and decreases from financial news data. The extracted topics, along with historical KOSPI index data, are input into an LSTM model to predict the KOSPI index. The proposed model has the characteristic of predicting the KOSPI index by combining the time series prediction method by inputting the historical KOSPI index into the LSTM model and the topic modeling method by inputting news data. To verify the performance of the proposed model, this paper designs four models (LSTM_K model, LSTM_KNS model, LDA_K model, LDA_KNS model) based on the types of input data for the LSTM and presents the predictive performance of each model. The comparison of prediction performance results shows that the LSTM model (LDA_K model), which uses financial news topic data and historical KOSPI index data as inputs, recorded the lowest RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), demonstrating the best predictive performance."

However, research on the differences between the dimensionality reduction rate and model prediction performance is still lacking for building energy-related data. Therefore, this study compared the dimensionality reduction rate and model prediction performance by handling missing values in weather information datasets, which is related to building energy. The missing value-handling methods were divided into removal, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation, and no handling. Dimensionality reduction methods were classified based on principal component analysis and feature selection using the model. Further, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, a gradient boosting method with its own missing data handling capabilities, was used. Consequently, few principal components were required to explain 95% of the variance in the raw data when the missing values were removed than when they were replaced with KNN. Moreover, the dimensionality reduction methods of model building and feature selection outperformed principal component analysis in terms of dimensionality reduction rate and model predictive accuracy. Particularly, the XGBoost model without missing values had the highest accuracy, suggesting that the missing-value handling method of XGBoost may be superior to conventional missing-value handling methods. These results may have important implications for selecting imputation methods in building energy data analysis, considering the effort and cost of missing value handling, and can significantly reduce the cost and effort of data preprocessing."

For example, on a specific day when the actual traffic volume was 640,000, the LSTM model predicted values ranging from 360,000 to 1,000,000, validating its reliability in range-based estimation. This study confirmed that traffic volume estimation is feasible even when using indirect variables, such as weather and foot traffic data."
A counting-time optimization method for artificial neural network (ANN) based gamma-ray spectroscopy,2024,"['Gamma-ray spectroscopy', 'Artificial neural networks', 'Optimum counting-time', 'Virtual spectra']",,"With advancements in machine learning technologies, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are being widely used to improve the performance of gamma-ray spectroscopy based on NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors. Typically, the performance of ANNs is evaluated using test datasets composed of actual spectra. However, the generation of such test datasets encompassing a wide range of actual spectra representing various scenarios often proves inefficient and time-consuming. Thus, instead of measuring actual spectra, we generated virtual spectra with diverse spectral features by sampling from categorical distribution functions derived from the base spectra of six radioactive isotopes: 54Mn, 57Co, 60Co, 134Cs, 137Cs, and 241Am. For practical applications, we determined the optimum counting time (OCT) as the point at which the change in the Kullback–Leibler divergence (ΔKLDV) values between the synthetic spectra used for training the ANN and the virtual spectra approaches zero. The accuracies of the actual spectra were significantly improved when measured up to their respective OCTs. The outcomes demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively determine the OCTs for gamma-ray spectroscopy based on ANNs without the need to measure actual spectra."

In Korea, the one-dimensional consolidation theory is applied during the design phase, and measurement-based prediction techniques (e.g., the hyperbolic method) are employed during the construction phase. However, these methods are limited because they may not fully reflect the site-specific characteristics or require long-term monitoring. Thus, in this study, ensemble-based deep learning models (i.e., the random forest, gradient boosting machine, XGBoost, and LightGBM models) were developed using the final fill height and ground information to improve the accuracy of the final settlement predictions and analyze the correlations with the input variables. In addition, a database was constructed from the measurement results and borehole data collected from six sites in Busan Port. The prediction results demonstrate that the random forest model achieved the highest accuracy with an average mean absolute error of 0.51 m and a mean absolute percentage error of 8.38%. In addition, the other models demonstrated high performance within specific data distributions; however, they tended to exhibit increased prediction errors when encountering out-of-distribution data. Shapley additive explanations analysis showed that the final fill height, plasticity index, consolidation ratio, clay layer thickness, and natural moisture content were the most significant contributors to predicting the final settlement."

The GRU model is then applied to each group, and the forecasting performance of each group is compared. To further improve the model's forecasting accuracy, the study adjusts the data sample size, input window size, and output window size, proposing optimized data input/output window sizes for each group. Two main analyses are conducted: First, whether the forecasting performance shows the same pattern across groups based on demand size volatility and zero demand irregularity is examined. Second, the impact of data sample size and input/output window sizes on each group is individually assessed. The results indicate that using a 10-year data sample size provides the most stable forecasting performance across all groups. Additionally, as the output window size increases, the model's forecasting performance tends to decrease in each group. Conversely, the input window size exhibits a U-shaped relationship with model accuracy across all groups, with the inflection point varying according to data size volatility."

Additionally, legitimate DNS servers are often used as attack agents. Since User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used in these attacks, it is challenging to detect anomalies based on session protocols, as is done in Transmissoon Control Protocol (TCP)-based DDoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting DNS amplification DRDoS attacks by converting attack packets into images and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize these attacks. Although this method may have a lower detection rate compared to approaches that extract and learn specific DDoS characteristics from packets, it offers the advantage of faster detection due to the omission of the data preprocessing step. Given the nature of DDoS attacks, where real-time response is often more critical than achieving near-perfect detection accuracy, this faster detection capability can be particularly valuable in practical scenarios."

의사결정나무 기반 디지털품질경영 예측 모형 개발 연구,2024,"['Digital Quality Management', 'Machine Learning', 'Decision Tree', 'CART', 'Performance Prediction']",,"This study aims to develop a comprehensive predictive model for Digital Quality Management (DQM) and to analyze the impact of various quality activities on different levels of DQM. By employing the Classification And Regression Tree (CART) methodology, we are able to present predictive scenarios that elucidate how varying quantitative levels of quality activities influence the five major categories of DQM. The findings reveal that the operation level of quality circles and the promotion level of suggestion systems are pivotal in enhancing DQM levels. Furthermore, the study emphasizes that an effective reward system is crucial to maximizing the effectiveness of these quality activities.Through a quantitative approach, this study demonstrates that for ventures and small-medium enterprises, expanding suggestion systems and implementing robust reward mechanisms can significantly improve DQM levels, particularly when the operation of quality circles is challenging. The research provides valuable insights, indicating that even in the absence of fully operational quality circles, other mechanisms can still drive substantial improvements in DQM.These results are particularly relevant in the context of digital transformation, offering practical guidelines for enterprises to establish and refine their quality management strategies.

Research on Hot-Threshold based dynamic resource management in the cloud,2024,"['Container Orchestration', 'Cloud Computing', 'Machine learning', 'Resource Scheduling', 'Resource Provisioning', 'Integrated Environmental Management']",,"Recent advancements in cloud computing have significantly increased its importance across various sectors. As sensors, devices, and customer demands have become more diverse, workloads have become increasingly variable and difficult to predict. Cloud providers, connected to multiple physical servers to support a range of applications, often over-provision resources to handle peak workloads. This approach results in inconsistent services, imbalanced energy usage, waste, and potential violations of service level agreements. In this paper, we propose a novel engine equipped with a scheduler based on the Hot-Threshold concept, aimed at optimizing resource usage and improving energy efficiency in cloud environments. We developed this engine to employ both proactive and reactive methods. The proactive method leverages workload estimate-based provisioning, while the reactive Hot-Cold Scheduler consists of a Predictor, Solver, and Processor, which together suggest an intelligent migration flow. We demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses existing challenges in terms of cost and energy consumption. By intelligently managing resources based on past user statistics, we provide significant improvements in both energy efficiency and service consistency."
TomoRay: Generating Synthetic  Computed Tomography of the Spine  From Biplanar Radiographs,2024,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Image conversion', 'Synthetic computed tomography', 'Spine', 'Machine learning']",,"Objective: Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a cornerstone in the assessment of patients with spinal trauma and in the planning of spinal interventions. However, CT studies are associated with logistical problems, acquisition costs, and radiation exposure. In this proof-of-concept study, the feasibility of generating synthetic spinal CT images using biplanar radiographs was explored. This could expand the potential applications of x-ray machines pre-, post-, and even intraoperatively.Methods: A cohort of 209 patients who underwent spinal CT imaging from the VerSe2020 dataset was used to train the algorithm. The model was subsequently evaluated using an internal and external validation set containing 55 from the VerSe2020 dataset and a subset of 56 images from the CTSpine1K dataset, respectively. Digitally reconstructed radiographs served as input for training and evaluation of the 2-dimensional (2D)-to-3-dimentional (3D) generative adversarial model. Model performance was assessed using peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and cosine similarity (CS).Results: At external validation, the developed model achieved a PSNR of 21.139 ± 1.018 dB (mean ± standard deviation). The SSIM and CS amounted to 0.947 ± 0.010 and 0.671 ± 0.691, respectively.Conclusion: Generating an artificial 3D output from 2D imaging is challenging, especially for spinal imaging, where x-rays are known to deliver insufficient information frequently.Although the synthetic CT scans derived from our model do not perfectly match their ground truth CT, our proof-of-concept study warrants further exploration of the potential of this technology."

1차원 ELS 가치 평가를 위한 DeepBSDE의 활용,2024,"['Equity Linked Securities', 'Machine Learning', 'Black-Scholes Equation', 'DeepBSDE']",,"This study aims to price ELS options using the DeepBSDE model, a novel deep learning approach for solving backward stochastic differential equations. ELS options present significant challenges due to their intricate payoff structure and path-dependent nature. We experimented with two types of ELS options: stepdown knock-in and knockout options. The DeepBSDE model shows similar results to those of classical methods like Monte Carlo method and Finite Difference method, but with distinct advantages. While Monte Carlo method provides only the options value without any additional information such as the value of Greeks, and while Finite Difference method offers comprehensive domain information but struggles with multi-dimensional problems, DeepBSDE avoids the curse of dimensionality, making it more practical for usage in multi-asset options. The results of our experiment reveal that despite its initial longer training times, the DeepBSDE model’s inference time is comparable to that of the classical methods, hence minimizing computational burden once the model is trained. Such efficiency makes the DeepBSDE model particularly suitable for markets in countries like South Korea, where stepdown ELS options dominate, constituting 70% of the market transaction. The DeepBSDE model’s flexibility also allows for future extensions to evaluate ELS options with multiple underlying assets and incorporate correlations between such assets.

Regular tests account for a large portion of grades, so if learners do not take the test at a set time and place, it may be disadvantageous to grades. Therefore, this study selected an optimal grade prediction model by collecting data on whether grade assignment is possible without data on regular test results of programming class participants. The results of this study are expected to be able to escape anxiety and stress about tests in that grades can be assigned without regular tests at a set place and time, and that new evaluation criteria can be created by predicting grades from various factors rather than being evaluated through tests."

To efficiently manage such a large amount of data, systematic classification into categories is essential. For effective search and navigation, data is organized into a tree-like hierarchical structure known as a category tree, which is commonly seen in news websites and Wikipedia. As a result, various techniques have been proposed to classify large volumes of documents into the terminal nodes of category trees. However, document classification methods using category trees face a problem: as the height of the tree increases, the number of terminal nodes multiplies exponentially, which increases the probability of misclassification and ultimately leads to a reduction in classification accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new node expansion-based classification algorithm that satisfies the classification accuracy required by the application, while enabling detailed categorization. The proposed method uses a greedy approach to prioritize the expansion of nodes with high classification accuracy, thereby maximizing the overall classification accuracy of the category tree. Experimental results on real data show that the proposed technique provides improved performance over naive methods."

According to our analysis, the reason is the use of the undersampling technique to address the class imbalance problem in the gait dataset. We propose applying oversampling instead of undersampling to solve the class imbalance issue. We also demonstrate the usefulness of anthropometric and spatiotemporal features in gait data-based BMI estimation techniques. Previous studies evaluated the usefulness of anthropometric and spatiotemporal features in the presence of undersampling techniques and reported that their combined use leads to lower BMI estimation performance than when using either feature alone. However, our results show that using both features together and applying an oversampling technique achieves state-of-the-art performance with 92.92% accuracy in the BMI estimation problem."

However, research on translation between spoken language and sign language is relatively lacking compared to research on translation between spoken languages. In particular, sign language-related research requires new approaches that consider the characteristics of sign language. In this study, we propose a Text-to-Gloss method to derive gloss, which is essential for pipeline-based sign language production, by converting spoken language into gloss, the morphemes of sign language. To this end, we propose an approach that extends or replaces dictionaries in pre-trained language models and analyzes the performance differences of these approaches in Text-to-Gloss. Our approach is expected to improve accuracy in pipeline-based sign language production, thereby enhancing communication for the deaf."

Previous research in rehabilitation and robotic arm control has often combined sEMG and IMU sensors to measure muscle activity and precise angles. However, in rehabilitation, utilizing sEMG signals alone may be more practical than using multiple sensors. The use of sensors like IMUs increases equipment costs and complicates data pro- cessing, making interpretation more challenging. In contrast, sEMG signals reflect muscle activation and can predict angles simply and effectively, making them suitable for assessing elbow movements. This study classified elbow flex- ion and extension angles into 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90° using only sEMG sensors. sEMG data were collected from the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles and analyzed using Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost models to eval- uate angle classification performance. The experimental results showed high accuracy for all three models, with SVM and XGBoost demonstrating particularly superior performance. These findings suggest that sEMG signals alone can effectively predict elbow angles in applications such as rehabilitation and arm control, providing a valuable tool for assessing and aiding recovery of motor functions in rehabilitation therapy."

Existing sign language translation studies inadequately consider the unique aspects of sign languages and rely on conventional spoken language machine translation methodologies. Particularly, there is a lack of investigation into gloss vocabulary and tokenization methods within the sign language domain, disregarding the diverse characteristics of sign languages across different countries and employing uniform methods for dictionary building and tokenization. Consequently, our focus lies on exploring language-specific vocabulary and tokenization methods within the sign language domain.

The pristine h-BN monolayer had an electrical band gap of 4.6 eV, indicating its insulating properties. A monovacancy with boron or nitrogen defects introduced a new energy level within the band gap. In the case of divacancy by boron and nitrogen defects, two energy levels emerged (i.e., 1.3 eV and 1.8 eV from the conduction band, respectively) between the band gap, producing an environment conducive to electron excitation from the valence to the conduction band. As defects in the h-BN monolayer increased, the band gap filled gradually with new energy states. Consequently, the electrical properties shifted from insulator to conductor. This research contributes a methodology for predicting the material properties through computational calculations, providing insights into the evolving electrical behavior of h-BN with varying defect densities."

Temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation were selected as relevant meteorological variables for solar power prediction. All data was preprocessed by removing their systematic components to use only their residuals and the residual of solar data were further processed with weighted adjustments for homoscedasticity. Four models, MLR (Multiple Linear Regression), RF (Random Forest), DNN (Deep Neural Network), and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), were employed for solar power prediction and their performances were evaluated based on predicted values utilizing observed meteorological data (used as a reference), 1-day-ahead forecast data (referred to as fore1), and 2-day-ahead forecast data (fore2). DNN-based prediction model exhibits superior performance in both regions, with RNN performing the least effectively. However, MLR and RF demonstrate competitive performance comparable to DNN. The disparities in the performance of the four different models are less pronounced than anticipated, underscoring the pivotal role of fitting models using residuals. This emphasizes that the utilized preprocessing approach, specifically leveraging residuals, is poised to play a crucial role in the future of solar power generation forecasting."

Cervical cancer is influenced by various environmental factors; however, the human papillomavirus (HPV) is detected in 99% of cases, making it the primary attributed cause. Additionally, although cervical cancer ranks 10th in overall female cancer incidence, it is nearly 100% preventable among known cancers. Early-stage cervical cancer typically presents no symptoms but can be detected early through regular screening. Therefore, routine tests, including cytology, should be conducted annually, as early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment. Thus, we employed artificial intelligence technology to forecast the likelihood of developing cervical cancer. We utilized the logistic regression algorithm, a predictive model, through Microsoft Azure. The classification model yielded an accuracy of 80.8%, a precision of 80.2%, a recall rate of 99.0%, and an F1 score of 88.6%. These results indicate that the use of hormonal contraceptives is associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer. Further development of the artificial intelligence program, as studied here, holds promise for reducing mortality rates attributable to cervical cancer."

Shear bearing capacity (SBC) is significant for reinforced concrete structures, and it is essential to develop trustworthy calculation models for structural design. This paper proposes a tree model-based SBC assessment system that considers eight design parameters of reinforced recycled concrete beams (RRCBs). Evaluation results revealed that the extreme gradient boosting model yielded the highest prediction accuracy with an R2of 0.960 and a mean absolute percentage error of 7.343%. To reduce the risk of black-box models, this study conducted feature importance calculations, sensitivity analyses and reliability validation of the prediction results. The findings demonstrated that increasing the hoop reinforcement ratio and beam width significantly improved the SBC of RRCB. The compressive strength and longitudinal reinforcement ratio had positive effects on the SBC, while longitudinal steel bar yield strength had no effect on the SBC. These analyses can be combined with physical mechanisms to better refine the performance design. Furthermore, a comparative study utilizing two commonly used standard formulas was conducted. The results indicated that the SBCs estimated using the tree model are more accurate than those calculated by the standard formulas."
The Impact of Odor Category Similarity on Multimedia Experience,2024,"['EEG', 'Olfactory perception', 'Multimedia', 'Cluster analysis', 'Machine learning']",,"Although we have multiple senses, multimedia mainly targets vision and olfaction. To expand the senses impacted by multimedia, olfactory stimulation has been used to enhance the sense of reality. Odors are primarily matched with objects in scenes. However, it is impractical to select all odors that match all objects in a scene and offer them to viewers. As an alternative, offering a single odor in a category as representative of other odors belonging to that category has been suggested. However, it is unclear whether viewers’ responses to videos with multiple odors (e.g., rose, lavender, and lily) from a category (e.g., flowers) are comparable. Therefore, we studied whether odors belonging to a given category could be similar in behavioral congruency and in the five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) of electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected while viewers watched videos. We conducted questionnaires and EEG experiments to understand the effects of similar odors belonging to categories. Our results showed that similar odors in a specific odor category were more congruent with videos than those in different odor categories. In our EEG data, the delta and theta bands were mainly clustered when odors were offered to viewers in similar categories. The theta band is known to be primarily related to the neural signals of odor information. Our studies showed that choosing odors based on odor categories in multimedia can be feasible."

The complete solution to the problem has not been found yet, therefore only partial information about the structure can be obtained from mass spectra, often in the form of various molecular fingerprints.

More than that, after repeating the procedure described in the original article, we assumed that at least some of their models were most likely overfitted. We streamlined the original approach by predicting multiple types of molecular finger- prints with a single multi-output neural network. We developed a lightweight and performant architecture (called Lite model for brevity) with improved accuracy (0.91 vs 0.89), precision (0.86 vs 0.77), and recall (0.71 vs 0.70) compared to the DeepEI approach. Additionally, the Lite version of the model was more than 100 times faster than the DeepEI approach in training and inference."

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in NICU can enhance clinical decision support and provide valuable assistance in these complex scenarios. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current status and future prospects of AI utilization in the NICU, along with the challenges that must be overcome to realize this. Presently, the primary application of AI in NICU is outcome prediction through the analysis of preadmission and high-resolution data during admission. Recent applications include augmented neuromonitoring via signal quality control and real-time event prediction. In addition, AI can integrate data gathered from various measures and support minimally invasive neuromonitoring to increase patient safety. However, despite the recent surge in AI adoption within the NICU, the majority of AI applications have been limited to simple classification tasks, thus leaving the true potential of AI largely untapped. Emerging AI technologies, such as generalist medical AI and digital twins, harbor immense potential for enhancing advanced neurocritical care through broader AI applications. If challenges such as acquiring high-quality data and ethical issues are overcome, these new AI technologies can be clinically utilized in the actual NICU environment.

Based on this, our study intends to utilize image encoding techniques to perform anomaly detection on time-series data. Data such as force, vibration, and sound from equipment during the manufacturing process are collected and transformed into images using various methods, including Gramian Difference Angular Field, Gramian Summation Angular Field, Markov Transition Field, and Recurrence Plot (RP). The transformed image data is then trained and classified for equipment conditions using various CNN models. Finally, we adopt the RP image encoding method and ResNet50 model, which demonstrated the highest accuracy of 99.6%, and compare them to the top 5 models. Based on the high accuracy demonstrated by the top five models, our proposed approach has proven to have significant performance, exhibiting a high success rate of over 90% even when applied to actual data for CNC-machining process. Through this, we propose a process that utilizes the explainable AI Grad-CAM system to identify the feature layer area of the image and confirm the presence of anomalies.

Designers are using more precise image descriptive words as input in applying prompt windows of Midjourney, the AI platform. This paper observed and analyzed characteristics of image descriptive words on the concepts of a signifier, as well as iconology in the classic text, ‘Macbeth,’ and in the painting, ‘The Last Supper.’ The image descriptive words in Macbeth and the iconography in the painting were seemingly expressed, but the situation changed the words and used signified different meanings. In context, image descriptive words could be used as shape developing tools in the AI platform-based design process. Thus, image descriptive words with precise word usage might be effective in developing more shapes in the AI platform-based design process."

However, there may be a gap between consumers’ self-reported perceptions and their observable actions. In response, this study aimed to investigate consumer purchasing behavior utilizing a big data approach. To this end, this study investigated the purchasing patterns of fashion items, both online and in retail stores, from a data-driven perspective. We also investigated whether individual consumers switched between online websites and retail establishments for making purchases. Data on 516,474 purchases were obtained from fashion companies. We used association rule analysis and K-means clustering to identify purchase patterns that were influenced by customer loyalty. Furthermore, sequential pattern analysis was applied to investigate the usage patterns of online and offline channels by consumers. The results showed that high-loyalty consumers mainly purchased infrequently bought items in the brand line, as well as high-priced items, and that these purchase patterns were similar both online and in stores. In contrast, the low-loyalty group showed different purchasing behaviors for online versus in-store purchases. In physical environments, the low-loyalty consumers tended to purchase less popular or more expensive items from the brand line, whereas in online environments, their purchases centered around items with relatively high sales volumes. Finally, we found that both high and low loyalty groups exclusively used a single preferred channel, either online or in-store. The findings help companies better understand consumer purchase patterns and build future marketing strategies around items with high brand centrality."

The proposed network was constructed using four bottleneck blocks, incorporating depth-wise separable convolution with channel expansion/projection to minimize computational costs. The performance of the proposed network was compared with other networks trained with an identical dataset. Our network demonstrated higher accuracy than other networks. It also had less trainable total parameters. Additionally, we employed the CVzone-based machine learning model to automatically detect face location. The neural network for mask recognition and the face detection model were integrated into a system for real-time door control using Arduino. Consequently, the proposed algorithm could automatically verify the wearing of masks upon entry to intensive care units, thereby preventing respiratory disease infections among patients and medical staff. The low computational cost and high accuracy of the proposed algorithm also provide excellent performance for real-time mask recognition in actual environments."

Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy-Derived Biomarkers With Convolutional Neural Networks,2024,"['Functional neuroimaging', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'Machine learning', 'Brain', 'biomarkers']",,"Objective To date, early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has mainly depended on paper-based neuropsychological assessments. Recently, biomarkers for MCI detection have gained a lot of attention because of the low sensitivity of neuropsychological assessments. This study proposed the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-derived data with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify MCI.Methods Eighty-two subjects with MCI and 148 healthy controls (HC) performed the 2-back task, and their oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were recorded during the task. The CNN model based on fNIRS-derived spatial features with HbO2 slope within time windows was trained to classify MCI. Thereafter, the 5-fold cross-validation approach was used to evaluate the performance of the CNN model.Results Significant differences in averaged HbO2 values between MCI and HC groups were found, and the CNN model could better discriminate MCI with over 89.57% accuracy than the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (89.57%). Specifically, the CNN model based on HbO2 slope within the time window of 20–60 seconds from the left PFC (96.09%) achieved the highest accuracy.Conclusion These findings suggest that the fNIRS-derived spatial features with CNNs could be a promising way for early detection of MCI as a surrogate for a conventional screening tool and demonstrate the superiority of the fNIRS-derived spatial features with CNNs to the MoCA."

It is essential for interpreting the geological characteristics of subsurface by providing accurate images of stratum structures. Typically, geological features are interpreted by visually analyzing seismic sections. However, recently, quantitative analysis of seismic data has been extensively researched to accurately extract and interpret target geological features. Seismic attribute analysis can provide quantitative information for geological interpretation based on seismic data. Therefore, it is widely used in various fields, including the analysis of oil and gas reservoirs, investigation of fault and fracture, and assessment of shallow gas distributions. However, seismic attribute analysis is sensitive to noise within the seismic data, thus additional noise attenuation is required to enhance the accuracy of the seismic attribute analysis. In this study, four kinds of seismic noise attenuation methods are applied and compared to mitigate random noise of poststack seismic data and enhance the attribute analysis results. FX deconvolution, DSMF, Noise2Noise, and DnCNN are applied to the Youngil Bay high-resolution seismic data to remove seismic random noise. Energy, sweetness, and similarity attributes are calculated from noise-removed seismic data. Subsequently, the characteristics of each noise attenuation method, noise removal results, and seismic attribute analysis results are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of each noise attenuation method and the characteristics of each seismic attribute analysis, we propose a suitable noise attenuation method to improve the result of seismic attribute analysis."

Functional hierarchical clustering using shape distance,2024,"['amplitude variation', 'functional data analysis', 'functional hierarchical clustering', 'phase variation', 'shape distance', 'SRVF']",,"A functional clustering analysis is a crucial machine learning technique in functional data analysis. Many functional clustering methods have been developed to enhance clustering performance. Moreover, due to the phase variability between functions, elastic functional clustering methods, such as applying the Fisher-Rao metric, which can manage phase variation during clustering, have been developed to improve model performance. However, aligning functions without considering the phase variation can distort functional information because phase variation can be a natural characteristic of functions. Hence, we propose a state-of-the-art functional hierarchical clustering that can manage phase and amplitude variations of functional data. This approach is based on the phase and amplitude separation method using the norm-preserving time warping of functions. Due to its invariance property, this representation provides robust variability for phase and amplitude components of functions and improves clustering performance compared to conventional functional hierarchical clustering models. We demonstrate this framework using simulated and real data."

In apple cultivation, photosynthesis significantly influences tree growth, as well as the quality and yield of the fruit. Chlorophyll content in leaves is often measured to evaluate this process.

This study aimed to estimate the chlorophyll content of apple leaves using UAV-based hyperspectral imagery. The study’s results showed that the estimation model using hyperspectral data preprocessed with the first derivative and the Support Vector Machine algorithm achieved the highest performance.

Promotion within an organization plays a crucial role in human resource management, as it helps select the desired talents. Various evaluation methods are used to select candidates for promotion. Ensuring a fair evaluation of multiple factors to select individuals who align with the desired talent profile is as crucial as verifying whether each factor is reflected in the actual promotion assessment results. A differential scoring allocation is commonly used to reflect the importance of factors in promotion selection. On the other hand, the impact of those factors on promotion diminishes significantly if the discrimination ability of each evaluation score for promotion candidates is low. This study used the Naive Bayes model to identify factors with significant influence. Moreover, the reputation scores, presently used as reference materials, carry sufficient value as criteria for promotion evaluation. Through this research, it becomes possible to discover the factors genuinely impacting promotions, offering valuable insights for formulating promotion-related policies."

In the personal mobile environment, performance degradation may occur during the training phase of large AI workload due to limitations in memory capacity. In this paper, we extract memory reference traces of AI workloads and analyze their characteristics. From this analysis, we observe that AI workloads can cause frequent storage access due to weak temporal locality and irregular popularity bias during memory write operations, which can degrade the performance of mobile devices. Based on this observation, we discuss ways to efficiently manage memory write operations of AI workloads using persistent memory-based swap devices.

It begins her personal background as a 1.5-generation Vietnamese American and her academic engagement in immigrant faith and the challenges of teaching faith in violent contexts. The work underscores the public dimension and impact of religious education, highlighting its potential for fostering critical capacities for public engagement. However, that study observes a prevalent disconnection between congregational culture and the aim of public engagement, leading to a form of learned helplessness among students and communities. The researcher draws on Paulo Freire’s concepts of “critical hope” and the need for a curriculum that transcends mere content delivery to foster transformative engagement with societal issues. The document critiques the disimigination machine that undermines critical thinking and collective resistance, as articulated by Henry Giroux, and explores the concepts of “learned helplessness” as a barrier to environmental and social activism. The researcher advocates for a theopoetic and theopolitical approach to education that nurtures hope and practical engagement with the world’s injustice. She emphasizes small acts of theopoetic and theopolitical hope as transformative practices, using an example from Ferguson, Missouri, to illustrate how public liturgy and protest can mediate hope and justice. The document concludes with a call for a life-long, life-wide, and life-deep curriculum of enchantment towards responsible participation in societal repair, rooted in Christian hope."

CAN (Controller Area Network) bus technology enables fast and efficient data communication between various electronic devices and systems within a vehicle, providing a platform that integrates and manages a wide range of functions, from core systems to auxiliary features. However, this increased connectivity raises concerns about network security, as external attackers could potentially gain access to the automotive network, taking control of the vehicle or stealing personal information. This paper analyzed abnormal messages occurring in CAN and confirmed that message occurrence periodicity, frequency, and data changes are important factors in the detection of abnormal messages. Through DBC decoding, the specific meanings of CAN messages were interpreted. Based on this, a model for classifying abnormalities was proposed using the GRU model to analyze the periodicity and trend of message occurrences by measuring the difference (residual) between the predicted and actual messages occurring within a certain period as an abnormality metric. Additionally, for multi-class classification of attack techniques on abnormal messages, a Random Forest model was introduced as a multi-classifier using message occurrence frequency, periodicity, and residuals, achieving improved performance. This model achieved a high accuracy of over 99% in detecting abnormal messages and demonstrated superior performance compared to other existing models."

A Method for Generating Malware Countermeasure Samples Based on Pixel Attention Mechanism,2024,"['Malware', 'Generative Adversarial Networks', 'Deep Learning', 'Pixel Attention Mechanism', 'Adversarial Samples']",,"Studies have shown that malware has become a primary means of attacking the Internet. Therefore, adversarial samples have become a vital breakthrough point for studying malware. By studying adversarial samples, we can gain insights into the behavior and characteristics of malware, evaluate the performance of existing detectors in the face of deceptive samples, and help to discover vulnerabilities and improve detection methods for better performance. However, existing adversarial sample generation methods still need help regarding escape effectiveness and mobility. For instance, researchers have attempted to incorporate perturbation methods like Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and others into adversarial samples to obfuscate detectors. However, these methods are only effective in specific environments and yield limited evasion effectiveness. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a malware adversarial sample generation method (PixGAN) based on the pixel attention mechanism, which aims to improve adversarial samples' escape effect and mobility. The method transforms malware into grey-scale images and introduces the pixel attention mechanism in the Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) model to weigh the critical pixels in the grey-scale map, which improves the modeling ability of the generator and discriminator, thus enhancing the escape effect and mobility of the adversarial samples. The escape rate (ASR) is used as an evaluation index of the quality of the adversarial samples. The experimental results show that the adversarial samples generated by PixGAN achieve escape rates of 97%, 94%, 35%, 39%, and 43% on the Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network (CNN_RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory (CNN_LSTM) algorithmic detectors, respectively."

자율무기체계(AWS)의 도덕적 책임 귀속에 대한 고찰: 집단적 책임을 중심으로,2024,"['Autonomous Weapon Systems', 'moral responsibility', 'responsibility gap', 'collective responsibility', 'moral agent', '자율무기체계', '도덕적 책임', '책임 간극', '집단적 책임', '도덕적 행위자']",,"The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have brought remarkable convenience to our lives but have also raised significant legal and ethical concerns, leading to apprehension about the future of these technologies. A critical issue in this context is the “responsibility gap,” arising from the ambiguity surrounding moral responsibility for wrongful outcomes caused by machines integrated with AI. Autonomous Weapon Systems (AWS) have revolutionized warfare, yet their capacity to operate independently, without human intervention, poses risks of unlawful or unethical actions. Traditional individual-centered approaches to moral responsibility are inadequate in addressing such complexities, and assigning responsibility solely to specific individuals or the machines themselves is inappropriate. This paper explores the attribution of moral responsibility for wrongful outcomes caused by AWS through the framework of collective responsibility. It attributes responsibility to the collective entities involved in AWS development and deployment, proposing principles and methods for distributing such responsibility. This approach aims to clarify the ambiguous responsibility arising in warfare and to provide ethical justification for the use of AWS. To this end, Section 2 examines the concept of autonomy as applied to AWS and critically evaluates their status as moral agents. Section 3 lays the groundwork for applying collective responsibility by analyzing genuine collective actions and exploring the feasibility of attributing collective moral responsibility for wrongful acts caused by AWS. In Section 4, three potential models of collective responsibility allocation are assessed, with a focus on the most suitable approach based on participatory intention and contributive impact. The concept of an effective moral agent is introduced to support this framework."
Imaging Evaluation of Peritoneal Metastasis: Current and Promising Techniques,2024,"['Peritoneal neoplasms', 'Diagnostic imaging', 'Molecular imaging', 'Optical imaging', 'Radiomics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning']",,"Early diagnosis, accurate assessment, and localization of peritoneal metastasis (PM) are essential for the selection of appropriate treatments and surgical guidance. However, available imaging modalities (computed tomography [CT], conventional magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], and 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [PET]/CT) have limitations. The advent of new imaging techniques and novel molecular imaging agents have revealed molecular processes in the tumor microenvironment as an application for the early diagnosis and assessment of PM as well as real-time guided surgical resection, which has changed clinical management. In contrast to clinical imaging, which is purely qualitative and subjective for interpreting macroscopic structures, radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) capitalize on high-dimensional numerical data from images that may reflect tumor pathophysiology. A predictive model can be used to predict the occurrence, recurrence, and prognosis of PM, thereby avoiding unnecessary exploratory surgeries. This review summarizes the role and status of different imaging techniques, especially new imaging strategies such as spectral photon-counting CT, fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) PET/CT, near-infrared fluorescence imaging, and PET/MRI, for early diagnosis, assessment of surgical indications, and recurrence monitoring in patients with PM. The clinical applications, limitations, and solutions for fluorescence imaging, radiomics, and AI are also discussed."
"ChatGPT in Student Assessment: Current Trends, Performance Comparison, and Future Prospects – A Systematic Review",2024,"['ChatGPT', 'AI in Education', 'Assessment', 'Student Feedback', 'AI-assisted Grading', 'Machine Learning in Education', 'Automated Feedback']",,"This systematic review examines the application of ChatGPT in student assessment, focusing on trends, performance compared to human raters, and future research needs. The significance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT in grading and feedback is increasingly recognized in educational settings. Based on a systematic review methodology, the review identified and assessed 16 empirical papers published between 2023 and August 2024 that were analyzed through a systematic search in Web of Science and Scopus. Key findings indicate that ChatGPT often applied stricter grading criteria than human raters, particularly for structured tasks like multiple-choice and rubric-based assessments, where it adhered closely to predefined standards, especially in structured tasks, and delivered comprehensive feedback across language, organization, and content. However, its inconsistent performance on subjective tasks, such as creative writing, raised concerns. Despite ChatGPT's potential for efficient grading in extensive assessments, issues related to accuracy, bias, and fairness in culturally sensitive contexts remain. One practical implication for educators is to use ChatGPT as a supplementary tool to reduce grading workload and enhance feedback efficiency, though its limitations necessitate human oversight. Future research should improve prompt design, refine AI algorithms, and ensure AI assessments support rather than replace human pedagogical knowledge. Addressing these areas is crucial for the broader educational application of ChatGPT and for enhancing the reliability and fairness of AI-assisted assessments across diverse educational environments."

Accordingly, in order to minimize property damage or human casualties caused by vehicle fires, vehicle fire risk researches have been conducted on specific types of vehicles, occurrence locations, and ignition factors in accordance with the need for analysis of the factors of vehicle fires. However, previous researches have derived limited vehicle fire analysis results regarding specific factors, showing limitations in analyzing various vehicle fire factors. This paper analyzed the causes and influencing factors of various vehicle fires, focusing on property damage, by applying big data analysis techniques to vehicle fire data from the National Fire Data System. To this end, in the experiment, factors for fire factor analysis of property damage were selected through correlation and significance probability analysis, and the importance of fire factors affecting property damage in vehicle fires was derived using the random forest algorithm. In the experimental results, fire factors that affect property damage are dispatch time(13.4%), fire station distance(13.1%), fire suppression time(12.7%), 119 safety center distance(12.4%), and participation personnel(11.6%) were analyzed in the following order. Through consideration of these analysis results, it was suggested that in order to minimize damage caused by vehicle fires, institutional improvement measures such as improving accessibility to fire sites, organizing appropriate firefighting forces for fire suppression, and providing fire extinguishing equipment are necessary."

Joint streaming model for backchannel prediction and automatic speech recognition,2024,"['automatic speech recognition', 'backchannel prediction', 'block processing', 'multitask learning', 'streaming fashion', 'streaming transformer']",,"In human conversations, listeners often utilize brief backchannels such as ''uh-huh'' or ''yeah.'' Timely backchannels are crucial to understanding and increasing trust among conversational partners. In human-machine conversation systems, users can engage in natural conversations when a conversational agent generates backchannels like a human listener. We propose a method that simultaneously predicts backchannels and recognizes speech in real time. We use a streaming transformer and adopt multitask learning for concurrent backchannel prediction and speech recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with previous works while maintaining a similar single-task speech recognition performance. Owing to the extremely imbalanced training data distribution, the single-task backchannel prediction model fails to predict any of the backchannel categories, and the proposed multitask approach substantially enhances the backchannel prediction performance. Notably, in the streaming prediction scenario, the performance of backchannel prediction improves by up to 18.7% compared with existing methods."

DNN-Based Force Estimation in Hyper-Redundant Manipulators,2024,"['Hyper-redundant manipulator', 'Minimally invasive surgery', 'Surgical robot', 'Force estimation', 'Machine learning']",,"Hyper-redundant manipulators (HRMs) have been applied to many robotic surgery platforms because they can be bent in various directions as they consist of many rigid segments and are operated in a cable-driven manner, allowing remote placement of actuators. However, due to the long kinematic chain and wire stretching when subjected to force, HRMs have disadvantages, including inaccurate positioning and difficulty in building physics-based models. These constraints pose challenges in realizing force feedback using HRMs. In this paper, we present a deep neural network (DNN) based estimation system for the external force exerted on the distal end of the HRMs using tensions and fixed positions of the cables as input data, which can be measured outside the human body. To generate a training dataset for DNN, a physics-based HRM model considering external forces, cable tensions, cable friction, and cable extension was developed. We also proposed the iterative optimization algorithm for the optimal configuration of the HRM. The training dataset was produced through simulation using the physics-based HRM model, and then the DNN-based force estimation model was trained. The HRM prototype was fabricated to verify the reliability of the training dataset and evaluate the performance of the DNN-based force estimation model. The estimated magnitude and angle errors of the external force were 4.8% and 10.4% on average, respectively.

However, training these models requires diverse and abundant data, which demands a significant amount of time and effort. The high cost associated with acquiring such training data often leads to issues like data scarcity and data imbalance. Data augmentation techniques provide effective solutions to address these challenges. In this paper, we focus on researching data augmentation techniques for object recognition models, specifically leveraging the Copy-Paste(Augmentation) technique. The previous researches involved attaching objects based on instance segmentation or visual context. However, we have discovered that using a straightforward approach, such as attaching bounding boxes of the same size to the existing object locations or randomly attaching objects, enhances the model's performance significantly. Furthermore, we propose a method of using the SAM(Segment Anything Model) to extract object instances from images and attaching them. We demonstrate additional experiments applying data augmentation techniques to the attached objects. To prevent existing objects in the image from occluded by the attached objects, we present a method of overlaying them into the image with attached objects. In this paper, we train the object recognition model using YOLO(You Only Look Once) v5 on the Pascal VOC12 dataset, and show better performance when utilizing the proposed data augmentation techniques."

Therefore, it is important to detect equipment abnormalities in advance so that equipment failures can be predicted and repaired before they occur. Most equipment failures are caused by bearing failures, which are essential parts of equipment, and detection bearing anomaly is the essence of PHM(Prognostics and Health Management) research. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing algorithm called SWT-SVD, which analyzes vibration signals from bearings and apply it to an anomaly transformer, one of the time series anomaly detection model networks, to implement bearing anomaly detection model. Vibration signals from the bearing manufacturing process contain noise due to the real-time generation of sensor values. To reduce noise in vibration signals, we use the Stationary Wavelet Transform to extract frequency components and perform preprocessing to extract meaningful features through the Singular Value Decomposition algorithm. For experimental validation of the proposed SWT-SVD preprocessing method in the bearing anomaly detection model, we utilize the PHM-2012-Challenge dataset provided by the IEEE PHM Conference. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance with an accuracy of 0.98 and an F1-Score of 0.97.

The joint approach of hierarchical Bayesian pooling models increases reliability by indirectly and directly identifying regional parameters, borrowing information from surrounding similar regions to supplement the insufficient sample data. Despite the non-parametric method utilizing the Dirichlet process for direct joint modeling, which samples parameters from an infinite parameter space while simultaneously conducting cluster indexing, research has shown its performance to surpass that of parametric joint methods. The non-parametric Bayesian pooling model using the Dirichlet process, which bases the pooling of regions on the inherent similarity exhibited by the observations, does not guarantee optimization of homogeneity within clusters and heterogeneity between clusters due to independent cluster indexing by region. This study proposes a modified Bayesian pooling model that includes minimizing an objective function based on the central distance within clusters as a constraint, thereby minimizing heterogeneity within clusters based on regional similarity while maximizing inter-regional heterogeneity. The performance of the model has also been confirmed to increase."

Considering that the application of artificial intelligence in thyroid cytology has potential for diagnostic routine, our goal was to develop a new supervised convolutional neural network capable of identifying nuclear grooves in Diff-Quik stained whole-slide images (WSI) obtained from thyroid fineneedle aspiration. Methods: We selected 22 Diff-Quik stained cytological slides with cytological diagnosis of PTC and concordant histological diagnosis. Each of the slides was scanned, forming a WSI. Images that contained the region of interest were obtained, followed by pre-formatting, annotation of the nuclear grooves and data augmentation techniques. The final dataset was divided into training and validation groups in a 7:3 ratio. Results: This is the first artificial intelligence model based on object detection applied to nuclear structures in thyroid cytopathology. A total of 7,255 images were obtained from 22 WSI, totaling 7,242 annotated nuclear grooves. The best model was obtained after it was submitted 15 times with the train dataset (14th epoch), with 67% true positives, 49.8% for sensitivity and 43.1% for predictive positive value. Conclusions: The model was able to develop a structure predictor rule, indicating that the application of an artificial intelligence model based on object detection in the identification of nuclear grooves is feasible. Associated with a reduction in interobserver variability and in time per slide, this demonstrates that nuclear evaluation constitutes one of the possibilities for refining the diagnosis through computational models."

So, it is not easy to deal with data imbalance. In this paper, we try to show the data imbalance problem in the basic random forest(RF) model used in network intrusion detection, and present the application and effects of balanced random forest(BRF). RF and BRF models were made up using the well-known KDDTrain+ data and evaluated with KDDTest+ data. The difference in the performance of RF and BRF was the tendency for BRF to have higher recall and lower accuracy compared to RF in intrusion types included in minority classes. Despite the decrease in accuracy, this effect of BRF can be expected to reduce serious damage by detecting intrusion types with high probabilities."

Zusätzlich zu den Gesetzen, die die künstliche Intelligenz selbst regeln, sind auch einzelne Gesetze, die weitere Sonderregelungen enthalten, fortlaufend anzupassen, um dem Entwicklungstrend der künstlichen Intelligenz gerecht zu werden. Die derzeit wichtigste Regelung zum Einsatz künstlicher Intelligenz in der Verwaltung ist die Regelung zur automatischen Disposition gemäß Artikel 20 Grundverwaltungsgesetz. Dieser Artikel sieht vor, dass Verwaltungsbehörden künstliche Intelligenz nutzen können, um verbindliche Verwaltungsakte in einem vollständig automatisierten System zu erledigen, wie es gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist. In diesem Zusammenhang wird diskutiert, ob beim Erlass automatischer Verfügungen verschiedene Verfahren des koreanischen Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetzes zu beachten sind. Es wird darüber diskutiert, ob Verfahren wie Kriterien für die Verfügung, die Anhörung und die Darlegung von Entscheidungsgründen beachtet werden sollten, und wenn ja, in welchem ​​Umfang sie beachtet werden sollten und welche zulässigen Ausnahmen möglich sind. Zukünftig gilt es, Regelungen zu erarbeiten, die die Besonderheiten der Künstlichen Intelligenz widerspiegeln und eine konkrete Geltung gewährleisten."

Sampling rare events using nanostructures for universal Pt neural network potential,2024,,,"The density functional theory (DFT) data-driven approach to generating potential energy surfaces using machine learning has been proven to quickly and accurately predict the molecular and crystal structures of various elements. However, training databases consisting of hundreds of well-known symmetric structures have shown fatal weaknesses in calculating amorphous or nano-scale structures. Ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations create a training set that compensates for these shortcomings, but there are still many rare event structures. Here we introduce a new method to easily enlarge the data diversity and dramatically reduce data points based on the highly defected nano structures for universal machine learned potential. Our potential applies to bulk and nano systems and has been shown to high accuracy and computational efficiency while requiring minimal DFT training data. The developed potential is expected to help observation of structural changes in the Pt-based nano-catalysts that have been difficult to simulate at the DFT-level."

Logistic regression models, support vector machines, and neural networks are representative examples of binary classification models. A popular metric for evaluating the performance of binary classification models is an accuracy. An accuracy represents the proportion of true positives and true negatives among all predictions made by the classifier, essentially indicating the rate of correct predictions. While the accuracy is advantageous due to its intuitive understanding and is widely used in statistics, machine learning, and computer science, it has the drawback of not accounting for the effects of false positives and false negatives. This study presents specific examples where accuracy leads to distorted interpretations and defines a penalized accuracy that can be modified to suit specific purposes. Additionally, we proves the relationship between the maximum likelihood estimation of an Ising model and penalized accuracy, demonstrating the potential for more extended research."

Therefore, while research on haze removal algorithms using machine learning and deep learning techniques is actively conducted, obtaining a sufficient amount of data sets for training realistically is challenging. For this purpose, this paper proposes methods of generating haze synthetic images using random noise with Gaussian distribution or Standard uniform distribution. When the haze distribution is uniformly spread overall, haze is generated by creating random noise, followed by normalization and low-pass filtering. When the haze distribution is localized, haze is generated using filtering in frequency domain and low-pass filtering in the spatial domain. The proposed methods allow users to select the desired haze distribution and generate haze synthetic images with the desired density using simple formulas. Additionally, experiments have shown that when using Gaussian distribution, denser haze generation is possible compared to standard uniform distribution."

Then, the organized method was applied to the NSL-KDD dataset, which is commonly used in intrusion detection research, to construct a model and confirm its effectiveness. While most of the existing studies have highlighted the accuracy of the random forest model with comparing it with other models or the selection method of input features, the method presented in this paper can be an alternative to construct and select an effective structure in the intrusion detection random forest including the maximum depth and number of decision trees and input features without compromising its accuracy of the intrusion detection."

To verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach, the optimization process was executed multiple times, each with varying initial random samples. In the case of the bodycentered cubic design, the optimal PUC was ascertained by examining a mere 2.08 % of the total candidate designs; for the Kelvin cell design, this value was 4.33 %. The effectiveness of the BO-driven approach was validated by comparing it with random sampling method."

Quantitative Evaluation of the Real-World Harmonization Status of Laboratory Test Items Using External Quality Assessment Data,2024,"['Development', 'External quality assessment', 'Harmonization', 'Index', 'Laboratory results', 'Standardization']",,"Background: In recent decades, the analytical quality of clinical laboratory results has substantially increased because of collaborative efforts. To effectively utilize laboratory results in applications, such as machine learning through big data, understanding the level of harmonization for each test would be beneficial. We aimed to develop a quantitative harmonization index that reflects the harmonization status of real-world laboratory tests.Methods: We collected 2021–2022 external quality assessment (EQA) results for eight tests (HbA1c, creatinine, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], and prostate-specific antigen [PSA]). This EQA was conducted by the Korean Association of External Quality Assessment Service, using commutable materials. The total analytical error of each test was determined according to the bias% and CV% within peer groups. The values were divided by the total allowable error from biological variation (minimum, desirable, and optimal) to establish a real-world harmonization index (RWHI) at each level (minimum, desirable, and optimal). Good harmonization was arbitrarily defined as an RWHI value ≤ 1 for the three levels.Results: Total cholesterol, triglyceride, and CEA had an optimal RWHI of ≤ 1, indicating an optimal harmonization level. Tests with a desirable harmonization level included HDL-cholesterol, AFP, and PSA. Creatinine had a minimum harmonization level, and HbA1c did not reach the minimum harmonization level.Conclusions: We developed a quantitative RWHI using regional EQA data.

Machine learning (ML) techniques can predict traffic conditions based on historical data and real-time information.

Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) requires repeated trial and error operations. Applying traditional RL techniques to the optimal control of traffic lights may lead to more serious traffic congestion in some cases. Therefore, this paper combines perceptual control with real-time adaptive control methods to provide a rule-based reasoning method for adaptive intelligent perception and precise control of traffic signals under real-time smart grid-connected hybrid vehicle conditions. IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) devices are utilized to monitor the parking queue length, pedestrian flow, vehicle flow, and traffic flow in each lane in real time to dynamically adjust the green light duration. By adjusting the light priority according to real-time vehicle and road conditions, this method solves the problem of wasting green lights when random accidents occur in a certain lane, optimizes traffic light settings, achieves real-time precise control of lane flow, and improves the adaptability and precision of traffic lights."

The most essential change is that no more ‘knowledge’ or ‘how to convey knowledge’ to learners should be the focus of education.Now, the key to education is that learners need a way to strengthen their ‘competence’. For example, learners are already prepared based on a lot of information and big data, so when a situation and problem arise, how much of their creativity can be used in the right place becomes a gauge of talent training.hen, how should the future of Chinese literature education, which teaches historical and cultural heritage of the past, change? As an alternative to this, this article suggested several possibilities for strengthening the ‘competence’ that can be dealt with in the subjects of “Chinese Literature” and “Language Life and Chinese Character” in the “2022 Chinese Literature Curriculum”. First, how to cultivate creativity, the contents of textbooks worthy of the current trend, third, how to develop convergent thinking through words and translations mixed with foreign words and Chinese characters, and fourth, how learners can use Chinese literature knowledge to solve problems on their own according to changes in circumstances, and fifth, how to strengthen communication through cooperative learning and project-oriented Chinese literature education, etc. were mentioned. Finally, concerns and alternatives about ‘Artificial Intelligence Digital Textbook (AIDT)’ were described, although it has not yet been introduced in Chinese literature subjects."

As a result of operating feedback based on “metacognition” as an educational response plan, the following educational meaning was derived: Self-feedback via self-evaluation activates metacognitive strategies for monitoring and self-regulation. Peer feedback reinforces self-objectification in the process of reviewing others’ writings. Instructors can use self-feedback and peer feedback to improve learners’ writing efficacy and encourage their participation in subsequent classes. Ultimately, a multilayered cascade of feedback that combines peer and instructor feedback with self-feedback is meaningful in that it creates conditions in which learners lead metacognition.Despite some limitations, we expect that the discussion in this paper will be shared as an example of a teaching-learning method in educational settings that recognizes the close relationship between college writing and metacognition."

Based on the results, suggestions were made to reduce the turnover rate of new employees. In this study, decision tree analysis was used as a machine learning technique, and turnover intention was set as a predictor variable, and the explanatory variables were composed of 26 variables belonging to personal factors, organizational factors, and job-related factors based on previous studies. When examining the top variables that affect turnover intentions of new employees, we found that variables such as 'job satisfaction', 'job-education match', 'working status', and 'age' are important. We also found that there are differences in the factors that affect turnover intentions of new employees between genders. For male new hires, 'job satisfaction' was found to be the most influential, followed by 'job-education level match', 'working status', 'age', 'HR system satisfaction', 'job classification', and 'major field of study'. In the case of female new hires, 'match between job and skill level' was found to be the most influential, while variables such as 'job satisfaction', 'working status', 'labor union', 'business type', and 'number of employees' were found to be important in considering a job change. The results suggest that a strategic approach to gender-based staffing is necessary, and at the same time, the turnover of new employees should be addressed in consideration of the fact that the MZ generation has a different concept of workplace than the previous generation."
DNN-Based Active Constraints Screening to Preprocess SCUC Problem,2024,['Deep neural network (DNN)  · Security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC)  · Active constraints'],,"Security-constraint unit commitment (SCUC) determines which generation units must be on and off -line over a time horizon. The computational burden increases from the increase in system size and various constraints.

A preprocessing strategy based on the deep neural network by predicting active voltage and branch constraints is applied to reduce the computation time of the SCUC problem. Numerical results of the modifi ed IEEE 30-Bus system and IEEE 118-Bus system suggest that active constraints can be fi gured out with high probability in a very short time. Moreover, the constraint-reduced SCUC problem can produce competitive results in terms of computational effi ciency with almost no loss of solution quality compared with the full constraints SCUC problem. The proposed approach achieves speedups of between 20 and 40% on diff erent testing examples."
F_MixBERT: Sentiment Analysis Model using Focal Loss for Imbalanced E-commerce Reviews,2024,"['E-commerce reviews', 'Sentiment analysis', 'BERT', 'MixMatch', 'Focal loss']",,"Users' comments after online shopping are critical to product reputation and business improvement. These comments, sometimes known as e-commerce reviews, influence other customers' purchasing decisions. To confront large amounts of e-commerce reviews, automatic analysis based on machine learning and deep learning draws more and more attention. A core task therein is sentiment analysis. However, the e-commerce reviews exhibit the following characteristics: (1) inconsistency between comment content and the star rating; (2) a large number of unlabeled data, i.e., comments without a star rating, and (3) the data imbalance caused by the sparse negative comments. This paper employs Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), one of the best natural language processing models, as the base model. According to the above data characteristics, we propose the F_MixBERT framework, to more effectively use inconsistently low-quality and unlabeled data and resolve the problem of data imbalance. In the framework, the proposed MixBERT incorporates the MixMatch approach into BERT’s high-dimensional vectors to train the unlabeled and low-quality data with generated pseudo labels. Meanwhile, data imbalance is resolved by Focal loss, which penalizes the contribution of large-scale data and easily-identifiable data to total loss. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms BERT and MixBERT for sentiment analysis of e-commerce comments."

Most cardiovascular diseases lead to heart failure due to an imbalance of immunity and attention in health conditions. Hence, immunity-based feature analysis of patients’ records is essential to predict accurate results. The machine learning methods make predictions depending on the extended-lasting features to analyze the health data. But the marginal features expose non-relational feature observation to reduce the classifi cation prediction accuracy. We propose a Deep Spectral Time-Variant Feature Analytic Model (DSTV-FAM) using SoftMax Recurrent Neural Network (SMRNN) in a wireless sensor network to improve cardiac disease prediction accuracy. Initially, the IoT sensor devices collect the data from patient observation to validate the data transmission in route propagation.

Adopting the machine learning technique XGBoost, we identify 24 predictive factors related to demographic structure and determine their importance and direction in election prediction. Our findings reveal, firstly, a notable decrease in voter ratio among both men and women aged 30-50, compared to an increase in the 60+ and 20-29 age brackets, across the 20th and 21st elections. The ‘female-late MZ generation’ demographic emerges as a key predictor, with its growth negatively correlating with support for conservative candidates. The ‘male-traditional generation’ group is identified as a critical predictor of conservative support. However, the ‘male-30s’ group, while being the third most significant predictor, shows that an increase in this demographic results in a decrease in conservative support. Further, our analysis reveals that out of 1,094 towns in the metropolitan area, 834(76.2%) towns experience demographic shifts favoring conservative candidates when comparing data between the 21st and the forthcoming 22nd elections.

Sorcin can trigger pancreatic cancer-associated new-onset diabetes through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as serpin E1 and CCL5,2024,,,"A rise in blood glucose is an early warning sign of underlying pancreatic cancer (PC) and may be an indicator of genetic events in PC progression. However, there is still a lack of mechanistic research on pancreatic cancer-associated new-onset diabetes (PCAND). In the present study, we identified a gene SRI, which possesses a SNP with the potential to distinguish PCAND and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), by machine learning on the basis of the UK Biobank database. In vitro and in vivo, sorcin overexpression induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. Sorcin can form a positive feedback loop with STAT3 to increase the transcription of serpin E1 and CCL5, which may directly induce β-cell dysfunction. In 88 biopsies, the expression of sorcin was elevated in PC tissues, especially in PCAND samples. Furthermore, plasma serpin E1 levels are higher in peripheral blood samples from PCAND patients than in those from T2DM patients. In conclusion, sorcin may be the key driver in PCAND, and further study on the sorcin-STAT3-serpin E1/CCL5 signaling axis may help us better understand the pathogenesis of PCAND and identify potential biomarkers."

K. Rowling)과 셸리(Mary Shelley)의 사례를 포함해 스타일로메트리의 성공 사례들을 소개하면서, 이러한 기법이 저자의 정체 및 문체적 특징을 밝히는 데 효과적임을 설명한다. 동시에 기존의 스타일로메트리 연구가 노출한 여러 한계점을 지적하고, 보다 풍부한 데이터와 정교한 분석 기법의 필요성을 강조한다. 특히 본 연구는 스타일로메트리가 문학 연구를 넘어 비문학 텍스트 분석, 사회·문화적 현상 연구 등 다양한 분야로 확장될 가능성을 탐색한다. 이러한 맥락에서 한국어와 같은 비서양 언어를 위해 특화된 기법 개발의 중요성을 강조한다. 스타일로메트리는 현재보다 더욱 포괄적이고 국제적인 연구 방법론으로 성장할 잠재력이 충분하다. 앞으로 스타일로메트리는 텍스트 분석에 그치지 않고 디지털 미디어와 비텍스트 매체의 연구에도 적용될 수 있는 중요한 도구로 발전할 것이다. 결론적으로 스타일로메트리는 디지털 인문학의 핵심 방법론으로 자리 잡을 것으로 전망되며, 이것은 텍스트 분석 기술의 자동화 및 정밀화, 다학제적 통합을 통해 인문학 전반의 성장을 이끌 것이다.","In a critical examination of Roger Kreuz’s recent work, Linguistic Fingerprints (2023), this study investigates the evolving field of stylometry, focusing on its capabilities and applications in analyzing the unique linguistic traits, or “linguistic fingerprints,” inherent to individual authors. The study traces both the historical origins and contemporary advancements in stylometry, a field that began with late nineteenth-century scholars introducing quantitative methods into literary criticism. A landmark development came in 2002 with John Burrows’s Delta method, now a widely adopted standard for measuring stylistic similarity across texts. Today, stylometry benefits from sophisticated computational tools, such as multivariate analysis and machine learning, which enable researchers to pinpoint authorship and stylistic patterns with remarkable precision across extensive text corpora. This paper not only reviews successful applications of stylometry in literature, legal linguistics, and historical authorship disputes but also addresses the field’s limitations. In examining case studies, including analyses of texts attributed to J. K. Rowling and Mary Shelley, the study illustrates stylometry’s capacity to uncover textual identities and nuanced patterns of authorial influence. Nonetheless, challenges remain, particularly regarding the need for methodological diversity to mitigate potential inaccuracies arising from stylistic overlap among authors with similar linguistic or cultural backgrounds. The study concludes with an outlook on stylometry’s potential as a fundamental tool in digital humanities, envisioning its applications beyond literary analysis to include non-textual media, forensic linguistics, and socio-cultural studies. It emphasizes the importance of developing stylometric methods tailored to a broader range of languages, such as Korean, to enhance the field’s inclusivity and accuracy. Through its multidisciplinary integration and ongoing advancements, stylometry is poised to significantly contribute to digital humanities and humanities research as a whole."
Visual Model of Pattern Design Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network,2024,"['Image processing', 'Texture vision sampling', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Image denoising', 'Feature clustering']",,"The rapid development of neural network technology promotes the neural network model driven by big data to overcome the texture effect of complex objects. Due to the limitations in complex scenes, it is necessary to establish custom template matching and apply it to the research of many fields of computational vision technology. The dependence on high-quality small label sample database data is not very strong, and the machine learning system of deep feature connection to complete the task of texture effect inference and speculation is relatively poor. The style transfer algorithm based on neural network collects and preserves the data of patterns, extracts and modernizes their features. Through the algorithm model, it is easier to present the texture color of patterns and display them digitally. In this paper, according to the texture effect reasoning of custom template matching, the 3D visualization of the target is transformed into a 3D model. The high similarity between the scene to be inferred and the user-defined template is calculated by the user-defined template of the multi-dimensional external feature label. The convolutional neural network is adopted to optimize the external area of the object to improve the sampling quality and computational performance of the sample pyramid structure. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can accurately capture the significant target, achieve more ablation noise, and improve the visualization results. The proposed deep convolutional neural network optimization algorithm has good rapidity, data accuracy and robustness. The proposed algorithm can adapt to the calculation of more task scenes, display the redundant vision-related information of image conversion, enhance the powerful computing power, and further improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of convolutional networks, which has a high research significance for the study of image information conversion."

This study mapping the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) of Changwon City, where active climate and environmental research is being conducted, using the protocol suggested by the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT). Additionally, to address the fragmentation issue where some grids are classified with different climate characteristics despite being in regions with homogeneous climate traits, a filtering technique was applied, and the LCZ classification characteristics were compared according to the filtering radius. Using satellite images, ground reference data, and the supervised classification machine learning technique Random Forest, classification maps without filtering and with filtering radii of 1, 2, and 3 were produced, and their accuracies were compared. Furthermore, to compare the LCZ classification characteristics according to building types in urban areas, an urban form index used in GIS-based classification methodology was created and compared with the ranges suggested in previous studies. As a result, the overall accuracy was highest when the filtering radius was 1. When comparing the urban form index, the differences between LCZ types were minimal, and most satisfied the ranges of previous studies. However, the study identified a limitation in reflecting the height information of buildings, and it is believed that adding data to complement this would yield results with higher accuracy. The findings of this study can be used as reference material for creating fundamental spatial data for environmental research related to urban climates in South Korea."

Predictive policing technologies have revolutionized public safety and crime prevention by enabling advanced data analysis and algorithmic decision-making. However, they also pose significant challenges to constitutional values and fundamental rights. This paper focuses on the potential erosion of key constitutional principles, including the presumption of innocence, due process, and the principle of accountability, in the context of machine learning and data-driven decision-making. It highlights the dual potential of predictive policing technologies to be extensively applied across various stages of criminal justice—from crime prediction during police operations to investigations, bail, sentencing, and corrections—while risking infringements on individual freedoms, privacy, and reinforcing systemic biases.To address these issues, the paper underscores the necessity of clear legal frameworks regulating predictive policing technologies and proposes legislative directions that establish explicit boundaries between permissible and prohibited uses. Key recommendations include the development of criteria that differentiate acceptable and restricted uses based on technology purpose and operational environment, strengthening oversight mechanisms for high-risk AI systems, and implementing mandatory measures such as robust data governance, risk management protocols, and operational logging. Furthermore, recognizing the cross-border nature of AI technology, the paper emphasizes the importance of international cooperation to achieve regulatory interoperability and prevent legal conflicts and regulatory arbitrage resulting from divergent national regulations. Strengthening institutional mechanisms to ensure redress and legal protections for individuals affected by predictive policing technologies is another critical focus, aiming to safeguard fundamental rights through post-incident remedies and recovery procedures.In conclusion, the paper argues for the establishment of a cautious and systematic regulatory framework that balances the transformative potential of predictive policing technologies with the protection of constitutional values and fundamental rights. Regulations should function not as barriers to technological innovation but as essential safeguards to prevent misuse and ensure equitable and safe deployment. Policymakers and regulatory authorities must adopt a balanced approach prioritizing long-term societal impacts over short-term efficiency, thereby creating sustainable legal and social systems to support the responsible use of predictive policing technologies."

Homomorphic encryption (HE) can resolve the concerns by allowing cloud servers to compute on encrypted data without decryption. However, due to the huge computation overhead of HE, simply executing an entire cloud program with HE causes significant computation. Manually partitioning the program and applying HE only to the partitioned program for the cloud can reduce the computation overhead. However, the manual code partitioning and HE-transformation are time-consuming and error-prone. This work proposes a new homomorphic encryption enabled annotation-guided code partitioning compiler, called Heapa, for privacy preserving cloud computing.

At the time of the invention of photography and cinema, the field of 'automatic creation' was established for them in comparison to traditional art genres such as painting. Recently, as AI has been applied to video production, the concept of 'automatic creation' has been expanded, and experimental creations that freely cross the boundaries of literature, art, photography, and film are active.  By utilizing technologies such as machine learning and deep learning, AI automated creation allows AI to perform the creative process independently. Automated creation using AI can greatly improve efficiency, but it also risks compromising the personal and subjective nature of art. The problem stems from the fact that AI cannot completely replace human creativity."

Policymakers are interested in the function of entrepreneurship in reducing unemployment and are increasing policies to support youth entrepreneurship. Most academic research also focuses on youth entrepreneurs. However, in reality, the number of entrepreneurs is higher among middle-aged individuals. With the ageing population, middle-aged entrepreneurship is expected to increase even more, but there is a lack of understanding about middle-aged entrepreneurship. This study utilized quantitative data on entrepreneurship and analyzed the factors influencing entrepreneurial intentions using visualization and machine learning algorithms. The differences between young and middle-aged indivisuals with entrepreneurial intentions were found to be more important in psychological factors than demographic factors. Middle-aged individuals had entrepreneurial intentions despite having a negative or low perception of entrepreneurial attitude, self-efficacy, and recognition of entrepreneurship. In summary, middle-aged individuals had lower confidence in entrepreneurship compared to young people. This study suggests developing entrepreneurship policies that are inclusive of middle-aged individuals, setting policy goals to promote a positive view of middle-aged entrepreneurship, and providing entrepreneurship education, perceived social support, and abolishing age-based entrepreneurship support."
Integrating predictive modeling and causal inference for advancing medical science,2024,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Causality', 'Forecasting']",,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by providing tools for disease prediction, diagnosis, and patient management. This review focuses on two key AI methodologies in healthcare: predictive modeling and causal inference. Predictive models excel in identifying patterns to forecast outcomes but are limited in explaining the underlying causes. In contrast, causal inference focuses on understanding cause-and-effect relationships, which makes effective medical interventions possible. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for causal inference, they face limitations including cost and ethical concerns. As alternatives, emulated RCTs and advanced machine learning techniques have emerged for estimating causal effects, bridging the gap between prediction and causality. Additionally, Shapley values and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations improve the interpretability of complex AI models, making them more actionable in clinical settings. Integrating prediction and causal inference holds great promise for advancing personalized medicine, enhancing patient outcomes, and optimizing healthcare delivery. However, careful application of AI tools is crucial to avoid misinterpretation and maximize their potential."

Currently, feed supply in aquaculture is primarily based on a fixed period and amount, depending on the predetermined feed quantity set by the operator, which does not consider the dynamic feed supply needs of fish. This can lead to under- or oversupply of feed, affecting the fish growth rate and water quality in aquaculture. To address this, a method is proposed in this paper to identify fish hunger levels using machine vision and predict the dissolved oxygen concentration in real time to prevent mass fish mortality due to water quality deterioration, even with additional feed supply. The method aims to verify its performance. Firstly, based on the observation that aquaculture farm operators estimate fish hunger levels by feeding time, a method is proposed to estimate hunger levels using machine vision and feeding time. Next, a combination of time series data decomposition model and pre-trained deep learning model is used to predict the dissolved oxygen concentration in real time."

To be more specific, we could say that there is emergent property if there is causally affecting computational power to the environment for its(or his/her) own future benefit when one individual system that is influenced by the surroundings. It is possible for Artificial Life to activate and affect causally to the environment on the basis of information that it perceived from the circumstances. For an example, in this paper, human brain dish cells that Kagan and others, Australian research team, did is suggested. In the experiments, rat’s and human dish cells and AI are tested. According to the results of the experiments, to learn a specific simulation game it took only 5 minutes for human brain dish while it took more than 90 minutes for an AI. In the mean while, if there is no stimulus rat’s brain dish cells were quicker to adapt to the environment than human’s. Human brain dish cells learned scarcely when there was no stimulus or feedback at all. They, however, learned much better when there were stimuli and feedbacks.This paper distinguishes computational power from computational capacity while it does not differentiate causal power from causal efficacy. Judging by the brain dish cells experiments, distinguishing those two are against the experimental results. In this paper, causal power is given as an example for computational power. Distinguishing computational power from computational capacity is that to differentiate human’s from AI’s. Penrose’s argument on the basis of Gödel’s incompleteness theorem says incomputationability of AI. Incomputationability means it has computational capacity while it has no computational power. Brain dish cells experiments show possibility that artificial life, especially a cyborg form of human brain dish cells combined with machine, can have true Gödel sentence. And they also show us that humans alive can be programmed by deep-learning algorithm. The limit of the experiments is that it does not seem like it would show highly enough autonomy since dish brain cells, by their own innate mechanism, are dependent on the simulation environment. Brain dish cells show us necessary condition for emergence that is computational power, but they do not show us autonomy that is sufficient condition to be considered to have a mind, consciousness, or soul."

One model utilized basic number of occupants and environmental (outdoor CO2, indoor CO2, ventilation system flowrate) data, while the enhanced model incorporated MET, gender, and BMI. Both models were trained on mock-up data collected from a controlled environment, including CO2 concentration, ventilation flow rates, and occupant information. Their performance was evaluated using MAE, CvRMSE, and R². Result: The enhanced model, integrating occupant-specific variables, demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to the traditional model, with MAE and CvRMSE values improving by 3.93% and 6.92%, respectively. These results highlight the importance of detailed occupant data for real-time IAQ management and the potential for greater efficiency in ventilation control and energy savings in sustainable buildings."

Unlike traditional store customers, online shoppers gather information through various media and make purchase decisions based on product reviews and purchase patterns. This study excludes personal basic characteristics such as gender, age, and occupation and instead collects and utilizes customer behavior data such as searches, cart additions, and page views to predict purchase likelihood. Given the difficulties in collecting basic characteristic data due to privacy concerns, the analysis method using only behavior data becomes even more important. This study used machine learning models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression to predict purchasing customers from behavior data. The performance of each model was evaluated to identify the most effective one, providing a reference for companies in selecting purchase prediction models. Additionally, we compared the purchase amounts between focusing marketing resources on identified potential buyers and distributing marketing resources equally to all customers to analyze the cost efficiency of targeted marketing. This study presents ways for online agricultural and fisheries retailers to better understand customer purchase behavior and efficiently allocate marketing resources to maximize sales. By providing a research framework and proposing prediction models, this study aims to offer methodologies for effective management strategies based on predictions from customer behavior data. Through analyzing customer behavior data, companies can develop more sophisticated targeted marketing strategies, ultimately leading to increased sales and cost savings."
Comparison of Normalization Techniques for Radiomics Features From Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Predicting Histologic Grade of Meningiomas,2024,"['Meningiomas', 'Radiomics features', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Normalization', 'Scaling']",,"'Purpose: This study aimed to compare the effects of different normalization methods on radiomics features extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Materials and Methods: Preoperative T1-contrast enhanced MRI data from 212 patients with meningiomas were obtained from two university hospitals. The tumors were segmented using 3D Slicer software, and the PyRadiomics framework was used to extract radiomics features. We developed four experiments to predict the histological grade of meningiomas prior to surgery. The first experiment was performed without normalization.The next three experiments used the StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, and RobustScaler to normalize radiomics features. The PyCaret framework was used for feature selection and to explore an optimized machine learning model for predicting meningioma grades. The prediction models were trained and validated using data from the first hospital. External test data from the second hospital were used to test the performance of the final models.Results: Our testing results demonstrated that meningioma grade prediction performance depends highly on the choice of the normalization method. The RobustScaler demonstrated a higher level of accuracy and sensitivity than the other normalization methods. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and specificity of the RobustScaler method were comparable to those of no-normalization but higher than those of the Standard and MinMaxScaler methods.Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that careful consideration of the normalization method may provide a way to optimize the experimental results."

A systematic review was performed to identify relevant studies from various databases. Studies that described or validated predictive models for CRCLM were included. The methodological quality of the predictive models was assessed. Model performance was evaluated by the reported area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Of the 117 articles screened, seven studies comprising 14 predictive models were included. The distribution of included predictive models was as follows: radiomics (n = 3), logistic regression (n = 3), Cox regression (n = 2), nomogram (n = 3), support vector machine (SVM, n = 2), random forest (n = 2), and convolutional neural network (CNN, n = 2). Age, sex, carcinoembryonic antigen, and tumor staging (T and N stage) were the most frequently used clinicopathological predictors for CRCLM. The mean AUCs ranged from 0.697 to 0.870, with 86% of the models demonstrating clear discriminative ability (AUC > 0.70). A hybrid approach combining clinical and radiomic features with SVM provided the best performance, achieving an AUC of 0.870. The overall risk of bias was identified as high in 71% of the included studies. This review highlights the potential of predictive modeling to accurately predict the occurrence of CRCLM. Integrating clinicopathological and radiomic features with machine learning algorithms demonstrates superior predictive capabilities."

In modern society, awareness of safety is prevalent along with anxiety due to threats to welfare and threats to crime. Anxiety about safety defines the very ontological horizon of our world.Foucault emphasizes the importance of the art of ethical practice in the realm of concrete everyday life in antiquity.

First, the future population values of each demographic group were estimated through machine learning and explainable AI, and the estimates were interpreted. The population estimates showed that all three demographic groups are expected to continue to decline until 2042. The future heat wave vulnerable areas, derived by overlaying population estimates and future heat wave days by demographic group, were predicted to be mainly inland for all three demographic groups. The spatial distribution of future heat vulnerable areas by demographic group showed that the western part of the country is more vulnerable than the eastern part, and that the heat vulnerable areas for the young population will be located in Seoul, the southern part of the Seoul metropolitan area, and metropolitan areas, while the heat vulnerable areas for the working-age population will be located in Seoul, the southern part of the Seoul metropolitan area, and the Chungcheongbuk-do region.

A new surrogate method for the neutron kinetics calculation of nuclear reactor core transients,2024,"['Time-space neutron kinetics calculation', 'Power prediction', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Recurrent neural network']",,"Reactor core transient calculation is very important for the reactor safety analysis, in which the kernel is neutron kinetics calculation by simulating the variation of neutron density or thermal power over time. Compared with the point kinetics method, the time-space neutron kinetics calculation can provide accurate variation of neutron density in both space and time domain. But it consumes a lot of resources. It is necessary to develop a surrogate model that can quickly obtain the temporal and spatial variation information of neutron density or power with acceptable calculation accuracy. This paper uses the time-varying characteristics of power to construct a time function, parameterizes the time-varying characteristics which contains the information about the spatial change of power. Thereby, the amount of targets to predict in the space domain is compressed. A surrogate method using the machine learning is proposed in this paper. In the construction of a neural network, the input is processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a fully connected layer or a deconvolution layer. For the problem of time sequence disturbance, a structure combining convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network is used.It is verified in the tests of a series of 1D, 2D and 3D reactor models. The predicted values obtained using the constructed neural network models in these tests are in good agreement with the reference values, showing the powerful potential of the surrogate models."

We discuss the various observational and modelling approaches used to study ocean surface currents, including satellite remote sensing, in situ measurements, and numerical models. We also highlight the major challenges facing the prediction of ocean surface currents, such as data assimilation, model-observation integration, and the representation of sub-grid scale processes. In this article, we suggest that future research should focus on developing advanced modeling techniques, such as machine learning, and the integration of multiple observational platforms to improve the accuracy and skill of ocean surface current predictions. We also emphasize the need to address the limitations of observing instruments, such as delays in receiving data, versioning errors, missing data, and undocumented data processing techniques. Improving data availability and quality will be essential for enhancing the accuracy of predictions. The future research should focus on developing methods for effective bias correction, a series of data preprocessing procedures, and utilizing combined models and xAI models to incorporate data from various sources. Advancements in predicting ocean surface currents will benefit various applications such as maritime operations, climate studies, and ecosystem management."

Autonomous exploration for radioactive sources localization based on radiation field reconstruction,2024,"['Radioactive source localization', 'Radiation field reconstruction', 'Autonomous exploration', 'Unmanned ground vehicles', 'Gaussian process regression']",,"In recent years, unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have been used to search for lost or stolen radioactive sources to avoid radiation exposure for operators. To achieve autonomous localization of radioactive sources, the UGVs must have the ability to automatically determine the next radiation measurement location instead of following a predefined path. Also, the radiation field of radioactive sources has to be reconstructed or inverted utilizing discrete measurements to obtain the radiation intensity distribution in the area of interest. In this study, we propose an effective source localization framework and method, in which UGVs are able to autonomously explore in the radiation area to determine the location of radioactive sources through an iterative process: path planning, radiation field reconstruction and estimation of source location. In the search process, the next radiation measurement point of the UGVs is fully predicted by the design path planning algorithm. After obtaining the measurement points and their radiation measurements, the radiation field of radioactive sources is reconstructed by the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model based on machine learning method. Based on the reconstructed radiation field, the locations of radioactive sources can be determined by the peak analysis method. The proposed method is verified through extensive simulation experiments, and the real source localization experiment on a Cs-137 point source shows that the proposed method can accurately locate the radioactive source with an error of approximately 0.30 m. The experimental results reveal the important practicality of our proposed method for source autonomous localization tasks."

If there are two people on board, the braking speed will be slower and the weight of the vehicle will increase its braking distance during sudden stops, leading to even more serious damage. Therefore, this paper proposes the illuminance sensors based multiuser boarding detection scheme for electric scooter, which is expected to decrease the risk of accidents and to lessen the likelihood of injury. From the performance evaluation results, it has been shown that the proposed scheme has higher detection ratio than existing schemes and has the detection accuracy of about 83% by means of the machine learning based foot position estimation for the sensed data."
"Exploring class imbalance with under-sampling, over-sampling, and hybrid sampling based on Mahalanobis distance for landslide susceptibility assessment: a case study of the 2018 Iburi earthquake induced landslides in Hokkaido, Japan",2024,"['class imbalance', 'under-sampling', 'over-sampling', 'hybrid sampling', 'Mahalanobis distance']",,"This study focuses on evaluating the performance of the resampling approach using under-sampling, over-sampling, and hybrid sampling techniques in the random forest (RF) model for landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA). For this research, the study area selected was Hokkaido, Japan, which experienced a total of 5,625 landslides as a single event   caused by the 2018 Ibury earthquake. The objective of this study is to address the class imbalance issue and improve the accuracy of LSA. Multiple data sources are utilized to obtain conditioning factors, and objective absence data sampling based on Mahalanobis distance is employed to tackle the unlabeled sample problem. The RF model is used to calculate landslide susceptibility values and generate LSA. These values are then evaluated using two diagnostic tools, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve  (AUROC) and the Precision-Recall curve (AUPRC). These tools help validate and interpret binary classification predictive models for imbalanced data. The results demonstrate improved performance with larger sample sizes, and the resampling approach yields better consistency compared to random sampling within the study area. To enhance the accuracy and consistency of machine learning techniques in reducing landslide risks, the study recommends utilizing hybrid sampling technique and Mahalanobis distance-based  absence data sampling in LSA."

Homomorphic encryption (HE) can resolve the concerns by allowing cloud servers to compute on encrypted data without decryption.However, due to the huge computation overhead of HE, simply executing an entire cloud program with HE causes significant computation.Manually partitioning the program and applying HE only to the partitioned program for the cloud can reduce the computation overhead.However, the manual code partitioning and HE-transformation are time-consuming and error-prone. This work proposes a newhomomorphic encryption enabled annotation-guided code partitioning compiler, called Heapa, for privacy preserving cloud computing.Heapa allows programmers to annotate a program about the code region for cloud computing. Then, Heapa analyzes the annotatedprogram, makes a partition plan with a variable list that requires communication and encryption, and generates a homomorphic encryptionenabledpartitioned programs. Moreover, Heapa provides not only two region-level partitioning annotations, but also two instruction-levelannotations, thus enabling a fine-grained partitioning and achieving better performance. For six machine learning and deep learningapplications, Heapa achieves a 3.61 times geomean performance speedup compared to the non-partitioned cloud computing scheme."
A new surrogate method for the neutron kinetics calculation of nuclear reactor core transients,2024,"['Time-space neutron kinetics calculation', 'Power prediction', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Recurrent neural network']",,"Reactor core transient calculation is very important for the reactor safety analysis, in which the kernel is neutron kinetics calculation by simulating the variation of neutron density or thermal power over time. Compared with the point kinetics method, the time-space neutron kinetics calculation can provide accurate variation of neutron density in both space and time domain. But it consumes a lot of resources. It is necessary to develop a surrogate model that can quickly obtain the temporal and spatial variation information of neutron density or power with acceptable calculation accuracy. This paper uses the time-varying characteristics of power to construct a time function, parameterizes the time-varying characteristics which contains the information about the spatial change of power. Thereby, the amount of targets to predict in the space domain is compressed. A surrogate method using the machine learning is proposed in this paper. In the construction of a neural network, the input is processed by a convolutional layer, followed by a fully connected layer or a deconvolution layer. For the problem of time sequence disturbance, a structure combining convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network is used. It is verified in the tests of a series of 1D, 2D and 3D reactor models. The predicted values obtained using the constructed neural network models in these tests are in good agreement with the reference values, showing the powerful potential of the surrogate models."

Fall Detection Using FMCW Radar to Reduce Detection Errors for the Elderly,2024,"['Contactless Detection', 'Detection Error Reduction', 'Fall Detection', 'FMCW Radar', 'Fused Feature.']",,"Fall accidents pose a significant threat of severe injuries for the elderly, who often need immediate assistance when they fall. Since the use of conventional contact sensors or cameras might be uncomfortable for the user, research on fall detection using non-contact sensors has received considerable attention. While most prior studies have relied heavily on Doppler-based velocity parameters to detect falls, using only Doppler information may lead to erroneous detection of fall-like behavior. As a result, a feature that accounts for additional information is necessary. Addressing this need, this study developed an algorithm for classifying falls by detecting human motions using frequency modulation continuous wave radar, proposing a novel feature to reduce detection errors. The suggested feature was computed using the rangevelocity map of the 2D Fourier transform and evaluated using supervised machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis, attaining an accuracy higher than 91%."

This study regards audit capability as the ability of auditors to produce the optimal production method (‘production capability’) from a production perspective. In addition, the production method of BIG4, which provides differentiated audit quality was judged as the optimal production method according to previous studies. In this study, in order to evaluate whether the capabilities of small and medium－sized registered auditors are improved, the change in production capacity after registering as auditors of small and medium－sized registered auditors was compared and measured using the difference－in－differences method with BIG4 and nonregistered corporations as control groups. This study estimated the input intensity, quality of input, and audit techniques obtained from the external audit performance of audit engagements under the External Audit Act including unlisted companies from 2018 to 2021. In the measurement process, machine learning and text analysis techniques was used to effectively obtain and process necessary information from a large－scale research sample. As a result of the analysis, the relative input strength of small and medium－sized registered auditors was weakened after registration of auditors, and it was confirmed that the proportion of risk assessment input by engagement partners in charge decreased. This study evaluates that the production capacity of small and medium－sized registered auditors has not improved after the registration. This suggests that despite the registration of auditors, small and medium－sized registered auditors have not faithfully implemented integrated management focused on audit quality, and that the auditor registration system needs to be further improved through policy adoption. This study proposes policy improvements such as the introduction of an integrated management system to publicly manage the use of work resources and the distribution of resources in order to lead transition to an organization focused on audit quality rather than an organization focused on the distribution of designated audit engagements."

An Artificial Intelligence-Based Failure Prediction Model for Three-Dimensional Woven Composite of Aircraft Wings,2024,"['3D Woven Composite', 'Aircraft Wing', 'Failure Index', 'Artificial Intelligence']",,"Three-dimensional (3D) woven composites are used to fabricate aerospace structures due to their lightweight properties. Structures made of 3D woven composite have a risk of failure depending on the number of fill yarn layers, which is an important design parameter. It is difficult to predict failure since the 3D woven composites have complex patterns. This paper proposes a method to efficiently predict the failure of 3D woven composite aircraft wings using an artificial intelligence (AI) model. We calculated the mechanical properties of each part that makes up the 3D woven composite wing structures using analytical methods. The yarn pattern is defined using geometric parameters and functions to obtain the mechanical properties. The stiffness and Poisson’s ratio were computed from a weighted average model (WAM) that combines iso-strain and iso-stress assumptions. The strength was obtained by increasing the load based on the local and global failure criteria. The failure index dataset was built using numerical methods. The failure index data are divided into training, validation, and test. An artificial neural network (ANN) learns the training data by forward and backward propagation. Epochs repeat until the errors are minimized through the loss function. The accuracy of the ANN is determined by an f-1 score and an area under the curve (AUC). We compared the results with the accuracy of other machine learning methods. Predicting the failure of the aircraft wings using the ANN is more time efficient than using different failure predicting methods."

Nevertheless, infrastructure improvement using 3D printers and robot technologies and 3D technology and AI-centered software innovation are being carried out in parallel. Image generation AI is being used in jewelry design processes that require creativity, and the need for methodological research on AI is being observed. Designs that are completed from tacit knowledge to human hand skills can also be created by prompt input on the AI platform. The prompt is in the form of natural language that conveys the user's command to the AI. In order for AI to convert and acquire natural language, which is human language, into machine language, the user must communicate effectively, and the method is called prompt engineering. The purpose of this study is to ensure that AI assists design activities and the possibility of productivity-based collaboration tools when using prompt engineering at the jewelry design stage. By analyzing previous studies and specialized books, we derived the prompt engineering elements as ‘concreteness’, ‘conciseness’, ‘structuring’, ‘style’, and ‘reversibility’, and applied them directly to jewelry design work. As a result, it was confirmed that the design quality increased as the structure of prompt engineering was applied. In addition, the potential as a productivity-based collaboration tool was examined by analyzing the correlation with the production time required according to the application of prompt engineering. Finally, it confirmed its meaning as a tool to develop design thinking that reduces the cognitive bias of creators. Learning and applying prompt engineering materializes intangible tacit knowledge and enables efficient design repetition. Through this study, it is expected that the resources involved in creative activities will be saved through AI, and the efficient relocation of the saved resources will be converted into human-specific value work, resulting in a virtuous cycle of the industrial environment."
History and evolution of blood pressure measurement,2024,"['Blood pressure', 'Auscultatory', 'Oscillometry', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Novel technology']",,"Hypertension is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hypertension mostly accompanies no symptoms, and therefore blood pressure (BP) measurement is the only way for early recognition and timely treatment.Methods for BP measurement have a long history of development and improvement. Invasive method via arterial cannulation was first proven possible in the 1800’s. Subsequent scientific progress led to the development of the auscultatory method, also known as Korotkoff’ sound, and the oscillometric method, which enabled clinically available BP measurement. However, hypertension management status is still poor. Globally, less than half of adults are aware of their hypertension diagnosis, and only one-third of them being treated are under control. Novel methods are actively investigated thanks to technological advances such as sensors and machine learning in addition to the clinical needs for easier and more convenient BP measurement. Each method adopts different technologies with its own specific advantages and disadvantages. Promises of novel methods include comprehensive information on out-ofoffice BP capturing dynamic short-term and long-term fluctuations. However, there are still pitfalls such as the need for regular calibration since most novel methods capture relative BP changes rather than an absolute value. In addition, there is growing concern on their accuracy and precision as conventional validation protocols are inappropriate for cuffless continuous methods. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the past and present of BP measurement methods. Novel and emerging technologies are also introduced with respect to their potential applications and limitations."

CNN을 위한 사투리 음성 데이터의 Spectrogram 이미지 변환 적용의 POC 검증,2024,"['Dialect audio data', 'Spectrogram', 'Mel-spectrogram', 'CNN', 'RNN']","본질적으로 음성 데이터는 시계열(Time-series) 데이터이며, 따라서 음성 분류를 위해 ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average) 또는 ES(Exponential smoothing) 알고리즘과 같은 시계열 알고리즘 또는 ML 측면에서는 RNN(Recurrent neural network)을 사용한다. 또 다른 방법으로 RNN 대신에 CNN(Convolutional neural network) 학습 과정의 입력으로 시계 열 숫자 배열이 아닌 오디오 데이터를 나타내는 이미지로 스펙트로그램(Spectrogram)을 사용하는 것이다. 본 논문에서는 시계열 데이터 분석에 RNN 대신에 CNN 기법을 활용하기 위한 음성 데이 터의 Spectrogram 분석과 Mel-spectrogram 분석 이미지를 입력 데이터의 이미지로 사용하며, 사투리 음성의 패턴을 추출하기 위한 CNN 모델을 제안한다. 또한, 제안된 모델의 파이썬 기반 프 로토타입에 의한 POC(Proof of concept)를 수행하여 가능성을 검증하였다.","In essence, audio data is time-series data. Therefore, for audio classification, time-series algorithms such as ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average), ES (Exponential smoothing), or RNN (Recurrent neural network) in machine learning terms are commonly employed. Another method is to use a spectrogram as an image representing audio data rather than a time series number array as the input to the CNN(Convolutional neural network) learning process instead of RNN. In this paper, we use spectrogram analysis and mel-spectrogram analysis images of audio data as input data, using the CNN technique instead of RNN for time series data analysis, and we propose a CNN model to extract patterns of dialect audio. In addition, the feasibility was verified by performing a POC(Proof of concept) using a Python-based prototype of the proposed model."

This situation is due to the fact that the methods of illegal goods transactions through e-commerce are evolving in various ways, but the control of illegal goods by customs authorities has not been able to improve and develop as fast as it should.<BR/>  Therefore, in order to overcome these problems, I propose the following measures for effective control of customs authorities of illicit goods in cross-border e-commerce. First, it is necessary to strengthen public-private cooperation, such as effective information sharing with e-commerce platforms, establishing a self-regulation system for e-commerce platforms through incentives from customs agency, and including e-commerce platforms in AEO certification. Second, it is necessary to establish an e-commerce-specific declaration form that contains accurate and essential information for risk assessment to enable effective risk assessment and control of illicit goods. Third, the use of cutting-edge technologies and techniques, such as AI and machine learning, should be expanded to overcome the limitations of customs manpower and to effectively manage the risk of cross-border e-commerce goods. Fourth, it is urgent to establish a systematic management system based on international cooperation for the management of international mail, the largest source of illicit and dangerous goods."

The top 100 keywords with frequency were selected among the data that completed the first and second data purification processes, and keyword network analysis was conducted by converting them into a 1-mode matrix dataset. In addition, an LDA topic modeling analysis was conducted to automatically derive topics through machine learning analysis using algorithms. As a result of the study, it was found that social awareness of the child care site support policy related to the reduction of the infants and children population includes information on 'stakeholder group', 'stakeholder', 'problem and cause', 'resolution', and 'policy and administration'. In addition, as a result of the topic modeling analysis of the child care site support policy related to the reduction of the infant population, five topics (tax benefits, opportunity provision, legal reinforcement, salary benefits, and system improvement) were derived. Based on these results, it is expected to not only identify various considerations for childcare policies related to the reduction of the infants and children population, but also provide meaningful implications for childcare support policies related to low birthrates."

In particular, the NSSI belief scale and urge to self-injury scale predicted the frequency of NSSI thoughts and behaviors, whereas the urge to self-injury scale and possible future self-injury scale predicted the recency of NSSI thoughts and behaviors. These findings suggest that the scales used in this study hold potential as tools for screening and predicting NSSI in adolescents, which could contribute to the prevention and early intervention strategies."
The Pathophysiology of Syncope and the Role of Transcranial Doppler in its Diagnostic Evaluation,2024,"['syncope', 'pathophysiology', 'transcranial Doppler', 'diagnosis']",,"Syncope, defined as the transient loss of consciousness due to reduced cerebral blood flow, is a common clinical presentation across patients of all age groups; however, it poses diagnostic challenges owing to its varied etiologies, ranging from benign reflex-mediated mechanisms to more severe cardiac or autonomic dysfunctions.Traditionally, the head-up tilt (HUT) test is applied to assess syncope by simulating orthostatic stress; however, its diagnostic yield is limited, particularly in cases lacking obvious systemic hypotension. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography, a noninvasive tool for measuring cerebral blood flow velocity, provides critical insights into cerebrovascular dynamics during syncope episodes and enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly when combined with the HUT test. TCD allows for the real-time monitoring of cerebral autoregulation and blood flow changes, and can be used to identify cerebral hypoperfusion patterns in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, orthostatic hypotension, and orthostatic cerebral hypoperfusion syndrome. Despite the diagnostic value of TCD, challenges such as technical operator dependency, interpretation variability, and the need for standardized protocols persist. Future research directions include the integration of TCD with advanced imaging modalities, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning for data interpretation, and refining personalized diagnostic approaches. Standardization and technological enhancements of TCD applications further hold promise for improving syncope management by providing a nuanced understanding of cerebral hemodynamics. This review explores the pathophysiology of syncope, focusing on the reflex and orthostatic forms, and highlighting the role of TCD in syncope evaluation."

The issues of super-aging, low birth rates, and the resulting regional depopulation are becoming major obstacles to sustainability in most developed countries. In a super-aging society, it is necessary to implement policy responses that satisfy the changed values of life and minimize intergenerational conflicts. For example, the free transportation policy for the elderly not only ensures mobility for senior citizens but also has significant advantages such as increasing economic activity, enhancing urban vitality, and securing diversity in population distribution. Such welfare policies do not exhibit uniform effectiveness due to the varying characteristics of the beneficiary groups. The main objective of this study is to propose a research methodology for policy effectiveness that can respond to future environmental changes. Minimizing the biases inherent in the traditionally used average treatment effects, this study conducted a detailed analysis of the diverse characteristics of individuals or different social strata. To this end, the study analyzed the heterogeneous policy effects of the elderly free subway ride policy, a transportation welfare policy that has become a significant issue in an aging society, focusing on the case of Seoul. In particular, to estimate the complex relationships between factors that can influence policy effects and the treatment process in the analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects, the study utilized a causal ensemble model combining machine learning and causal inference theory. The analysis revealed that in some old urban areas with a high residential rate, elderly individuals did not benefit from the free subway ride policy despite their large numbers. Additionally, it was confirmed that conditions such as life satisfaction, walking environment satisfaction, and cultural and arts budget, besides public transportation infrastructure, had a positive correlation with policy effects. This study is significant in that it calculates heterogeneous treatment effects and suggests a policy effectiveness analysis approach to build a policy roadmap that is inclusive and maximizes social welfare across the city by analyzing individual and class characteristics."

However, these readings may not accurately represent an individual’s typical BP levels. This approach can lead to misdiagnoses, such as white coat or masked hypertension, resulting in either unnecessary treatment or missed diagnoses.Current Concepts: Recent global hypertension guidelines emphasize the importance of home BP monitoring and 24-hour ambulatory BP measurements for more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. However, several barriers exist, such as the high cost of ambulatory BP devices and practical challenges associated with home BP monitoring, which limit their widespread utilization. Despite these challenges, integrating BP measurements into mobile devices offers a promising approach to monitoring BP outside the clinical setting. Various innovative approaches have been developed, including smartwatches utilizing photoplethysmography sensors and machine learning algorithms. However, their accuracy and the need for periodic calibration are areas of concern.Discussion and Conclusion: Mobile device BP monitoring represents a significant advancement in hypertension management, offering the potential for continuous, convenient, and less intrusive monitoring. Despite these potential benefits, challenges such as device accuracy verification, large-scale data interpretation, and calibration must be addressed. The future of hypertension management will likely rely on these technologies, along with traditional methods, to provide better insight into individual BP profiles. This integration promises to improve hypertension diagnosis, management, and ultimately patient outcomes, although further research and development are necessary to overcome the current limitations."

To address these issues, we introduce an interactive visualization tool, LIMEVis, which improves the analysis workflow of LIME by enabling users to explore multiple LIME results simultaneously and modify them directly. With LIMEVis, we could conveniently identify common features in input images that a model seems to mainly consider for category classification. Additionally, by interactively modifying the LIME results, we could determine which segments in an image influence the model's classification."

K-means is sensitive for initialization and has the possibility to be stuck in local optimum because of hill climbing clustering method. Therefore, we need a robust K-means (RK-means) not only to reduce this possibility but also to increase the probability to search the global optimal clustering solution. The objective of this paper is to propose RK-means with best initial solution from good solutions with good central data for each cluster. The central data of each cluster is selected based on Roulette wheel probabilistic selection using sum of relative distance rate of each data. They have a problem in high density data because they deterministically select the central data for just one initial solution of K-medoid. Our proposed initial solution is the good starting point to find the robust solution by K-means with reducing the possibility being stuck in local optimal solutions. The performance of proposed RK-means data clustering is validated using machine learning repository datasets (Iris, Wine, Glass, Vowel, Cloud) comparing to original K-means by experiment and analysis. Our simulation shows that RK-means using probabilistically relative distance rate are better than K-means with random initialization. The minimum squared distance by RK-means with smaller deviation is lower than that by K-means with higher deviation. RK-means is competitive comparing to data clustering methods based on simulated annealing (SA) and hybrid K-means with SA (KSA & KSAK)."

Predicting of load capacity of concrete columns confined with FRP bars and subjected to axial compression at different eccentricity levels,2024,"['axial capacity', 'FRP bars', 'regression analysis', 'RC columns', 'XGBoost algorithm']",,"In this study, two new models were developed to predict the peak axial capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) compressive members having fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars at different eccentricity levels (e/h = 0 and e/h ranges from 0.08 to 1) using two distinct methods: the general regression method and the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. These models were developed based on a wide range dataset comprising tests data of 308 FRP-reinforced concrete samples compiled from the existing literature. Besides, the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed models were assessed using five statistical indicators namely, coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), average absolute error (AAE), standard deviation (SD), and were equated with design codes and previously proposed formulas in the literature. The findings demonstrate that the suggested estimation models were suitable for capturing the axial capacity of FRP-RC compressive members. Particularly, the XGBoost model exhibited outstanding performance with a high R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.98 and minimal RMSE, MAE, AAE and SD values of 259.05 kN, 144.36 kN, 0.11, and 0.14 respectively, indicating excellent efficiency and accuracy compared to both the empirical model proposed and other existing models. This outcome highlights the ability of machine learning models to estimate the axial capacity of FRP-RC compressive members. Consequently, the XGBoost model offers a viable alternative method to empirical models for design applications."

Therefore, it is important to automate and continuously operate frost observation in risk areas to prevent agricultural frost damage. In the existing frost observation using leaf wetness sensors, there is a problem that the reference voltage value fluctuates over a long period of time due to contamination of the observation sensor or changes in the humidity of the surrounding environment. In this study, adatalogger program was implemented to automatically solve these problems.

PINN은 블랙-숄즈 편미분방정식 및 경계 조건을 신경망 훈련 과정에 직접 통합함으로써 유망한 대안을 제공한다. 우리 PINN 모델은 미분 가능성과 목표 데이터 샘플링을 위해 Softplus 함수를 포함한 기술을 사용하여 성능을 향상시킨다. 우리는 모델을 유한 차분법 및 이항 방법과 비교하여 동등한 정확성을 입증했다. 또한, 제거 연구는 손실함수의 미분 가능성과 충격 영역 근처의 목표 데이터의 중요성을 강조한다. 이러한 결과는 복잡한 금융 모델링 작업에 대해 전통적인 수치 방법과 현대적인 기계 학습 접근 방식의 잠재력을 보여준다.","This paper explores the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINNs) to the valuation of American put options. Traditional methods such as the finite difference method and binomial trees are commonly used but face challenges related to computational efficiency. PINNs offer a promising alternative by incorporating the Black-Scholes partial differential equation(PDE) and its boundary conditions directly into the neural network training process. Our PINN model uses advanced techniques, including the Softplus function for smoothing and targeted data sampling, to enhance performance. We benchmarked our model against finite difference methods and binomial methods, demonstrating comparable accuracy. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the importance of smoothness of loss functions and targeted data near shock regions. The results underscore the potential of combining traditional numerical methods with modern machine learning approaches for complex financial modeling tasks."

Despite this growing presence, the expected increase in linguistic diversity on campuses has not been observed. This paper explores the perceptions of both domestic and international students regarding the presence of multilingual signage on and near campus, as well as their perceived reasons for its absence. For this purpose, the students of two universities with similar sizes and language policies were interviewed. The analysis of ethnographic interviews reveals that they only minimally experience the internationalization of universities and the presence of multilingual signage. The prevailing ideology of English as a global language and the marginalized status of international students are stated as key reasons for the lack of multilingual signage. Even international students do not feel a strong need for such signage, given the widespread use of online communities, machine translation technology, and immersive learning of Korean language and culture. However, they also see potential in multilingual signs as tools for university branding and as emotional support for international students. This paper argues that multilingual signage in internationalized universities should be considered not just as communicative tools for information sharing and commanding, but as affective resources for branding and belonging among international students."

The meeting was the naming ceremony of AI and the launch of a new discipline. Leading the meeting were John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky.Along with Herbert Simon and Alan Newell, the Dartmouth Four have been hailed as the founders and pioneers of AI. But the researchers behind the success of neural network-based AI, and more notably deep learning, probably disagree with this interpretation. The groundwork of the new AI, represented by neural networks, robotics, and artificial life, was laid by cybernetics in the 1940s. Launched in 1956, AI focused on simulating human intelligence with digital computers, among the many prospects of machine intelligence presented by cybernetics.Early AI, now called GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI), rejected the tradition of cybernetics while establishing its institutional foundations and persecuting neural networks and artificial brains. This paper draws attention to the history of the time when AI was born in 1956, examines what happened on the path from cybernetics to AI, and why the pioneers of AI tried to distinguish themselves from cybernetics and sever its academic connection."

The analysis was conducted using the Random Forest model (AUC = 0.910) and XGBoost model (Accuracy = 0.808, Kappa = 0.594, F1 – measure = 0.494), which were evaluated as having high classification accuracy during the machine learning model development process. Consequently, factors with a high mean decrease Gini (MDG), representing classification importance, were identified as the presence of cracks (average MDG of both models: 22.1), peak elevation (14.8), and the presence of steps (7.0), indicating that these were significant factors in  determining slow-moving  landslide-prone  areas. The presence  of  cracks  and steps aligned  well with the characteristics of slow-moving landslides, suggesting that their importance should be emphasized in future detailed landslide surveys. However, the influence of the peak elevation was considered somewhat overestimated due to the characteristics of the input data used in the analysis. These findings are expected to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of final judgments in detailed landslide surveys."

Estimating above-ground biomass of trees outside forests using multi-frequency SAR data in the semi-arid regional landscape of southern India,2024,['Above ground biomass · Random forest · Sentinel-1 · ALOS PALSAR · Synthetic aperture radar · Trees · Semi-arid'],,"Trees outside forests are vital for sustainable resource management and play a crucial role in the sequestration of carbon. This study attempted to estimate the above ground biomass (AGB) of trees outside forests utilizing the datasets of ALOS PALSAR-2 (L-band) and Sentinel-1 (C-band), with a focus on a semi-arid region in Sri Sathya Sai district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Here, we employed random forest (RF) algorithm integrating AGB observed over a large-scale ecological plot and remote sensing technology for generating 3 models (Model-1 (M1), Model-2 (M2), and Model-3 (M3)). Backscattering coefficients (VV and VH) and H-α dual pol decomposition parameter, anisotropy (A) from Sentinel-1 were applied for M1, and the backscattering coefficients (HV and HH) and the band ratio (HV/HH) from ALOS PALSAR-2 data were utilized in M2. M3 is the ensemble of parameters from both sensors. Validating the three models found that the R2 values fall between 0.44 and 0.64, the RMSE between 1.89 t/ha and 2.49 t/ha, and the MAE between 1.56 t/ha and 1.99 t/ha. The results of the study suggest that both Sentinel-1 and ALOS PALSAR-2 data can be employed for AGB estimation in semi-arid regions incorporating machine learning algorithms like RF.

The reason for the need for SW safety is simple. SW is used with essential facilities in various areas, but it is difficult to check how it is handled internally. It is also because the wavelength of the problem that occurs is large. In reality, it is difficult to completely control the defects in SW that may appear during the development process. However, it can be said that the SW is safe in a state in which the defect can be accommodated or maintained at a controllable level. SW safety is threatened by various factors such as the complexity of the SW, the environment in which the SW is used, and the way the SW is developed and operated. Above all, SW errors or defects can cause various problems such as property damage, human life damage, and environmental damage, so the government should recognize the importance of SW safety and take measures to prevent it. To this end, SW safety must be considered from the early stages of SW development, and legal maintenance needs to be carried out so that the safety can be guaranteed throughout the entire SW life cycle such as development, test, and operation. SW safety can be materialized through discussions on constitutional safety rights. As AI algorithms are advanced through machine learning, it is becoming difficult for developers to explain the results due to the black-box effect. In this regard, it is an important policy task to improve the system for SW safety rights and SW safety governance as constitutionally derived basic rights. I think this is why SW safety is included in the government's national task. This is because it is not very different from the purpose of the national task in that it is the ultimate goal pursued by SW safety-related legal systems and policies for public safety. Accordingly, for proactive prevention and ex post relief, we would like to propose legislative policy measures for a governance system related to digital safety, including AI, beyond SW safety as a way to increase the policy effect of the absence of safety systems and governance in various distributed areas to realize a safe digital society through securing internal and external security."

From 2021 to 2022, ground observation data in Jeju Island in spring (March to May) were trained through the XGBoost algorithm. The algorithm was trained on observation data up to six hours prior to the occurrence of wind shear and hydraulic jump phenomena, constructing prediction models at one-hour intervals. Each model determines the occurrence and calculates the weighted average probability of occurrence. The performance evaluation using spring data from 2023 showed that both the wind shear and hydraulic jump early warning detection models achieved the highest Probability of Detection (POD) in the one-hour-ahead prediction model. The probabilistic time series distribution indicated that both models predicted occurrences with high probability. This suggests that wind shear and hydraulic jump phenomena can be sufficiently detected in advance through machine learning, potentially aiding decision-making in aviation weather forecasting."

It is now time to consider how to coexist with AI in the realm of religion and ministry. This paper explores the challenges and issues that artificial intelligenceparticularly machine learning and deep learning applied to big dataposes to pastoral care and counseling. The researcher adopted a literature review methodology to analyze and review relevant studies for this research. Artificial intelligence is an engineering technology modeled after human brain neural networks and designed to perform information processing and intelligence roles similar to humans. The development of AI is closely related to the field of psychological counseling, and recently, it has been actively applied in psychological care and mental health, which involves managing human cognition, emotion, and behavior. When AI is used in pastoral care and counseling, its convenience and accessibility are valuable, offering advantages such as improving the training of pastoral counselors and increasing psychotherapeutic efficiency. However, there is also a risk that AI may limit the therapeutic relationship with the client, hinder the experience of God's presence, generate false information, raise human rights issues due to algorithmic bias, and raise ethical issues surrounding privacy and personal information. The use of AI in pastoral care and counseling raises critical questions: Can pastoral care ministries of healing, supporting, guiding, and reconciliation be effectively conducted using AI? Is pastoral counseling with spiritual discernment still possible?  The Korean church and the broader Christian community that practices Christian counseling urgently need to establish ethical guidelines and develop educational programs for the era of AI. They also need to cultivate professional pastoral counselors who are trained in Christian spirituality and scientific and technological approaches to AI."

Despite this, the current Korean Capital Markets Act on the regulation of market price manipulation is not yet appropriate against this phenomenon.In order to prevent price manipulation using algorithms, it is necessary to introduce a ‘legal’ basis for supporting the price determination function of the market into the current Capital Markets Act. This includes specifying the types of [high-frequency] algorithmic transactions that are prohibited, establishing a device to support monitoring of algorithmic transactions, and imposing registration obligations on [high-frequency] algorithmic traders to select and manage them, thereby expanding the supervisors’ authority to intervene timely in the market.In addition, it is necessary to revise the law to effectively sanction those who attempt to manipulate prices through high-frequency trading using algorithms. Articles 176, 178, and 178-2 of the current Capital Markets Act, which require proof of ‘purpose’ (intent to mislead others) in order to punish criminally or impose penalty surcharge on offenders, are no longer serving its purpose. Article 443 of the Capital Market Act, which stipulates criminal penalties for offenders, and Article 429-2 of the Act, which stipulates the basis for imposing penalty surcharge, also require that sanctions be imposed only when the ‘amount of profit accrued/losses avoided by a violation’ can be calculated, but it lacks legitimacy, so urgent revision of the law is necessary. In particular, since algorithmic trading using generative AI capable of machine learning will become more common in the future, discussions on the obligation to establish internal control systems on high-frequency algorithmic traders should be held in parallel.Furthermore, as globalization progresses and each country’s markets become more closely connected, efforts should be made to improve the cooperative system among overseas supervisors and exchanges in order to effectively detect and investigate price manipulation activities of an extraterritorial nature."

Consequently, there is a growing need for technology to detect and monitor these occurrences, especially as the frequency of flooding events rises. To minimize flood damage, continuous monitoring is essential, and flood areas can be detected by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which is not affected by climate conditions. The observed data undergoes a preprocessing step, utilizing a median filter to reduce noise. Classification techniques were employed to classify water bodies and non-water bodies, with the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of each method in flood detection. In this study, the Otsu method and Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique were utilized for the classification of water bodies and non-water bodies. The overall performance of the models was assessed using a Confusion Matrix. The suitability of flood detection was evaluated by comparing the Otsu method, an optimal threshold-based classifier, with SVM, a machine learning technique that minimizes misclassifications through training. The Otsu method demonstrated suitability in delineating boundaries between water and non- water bodies but exhibited a higher rate of misclassifications due to the influence of mixed substances. Conversely, the use of SVM resulted in a lower false positive rate and proved less sensitive to mixed substances. Consequently, SVM exhibited higher accuracy under conditions excluding flooding. While the Otsu method showed slightly higher accuracy in flood conditions compared to SVM, the difference in accuracy was less than 5% (Otsu: 0.93, SVM: 0.90). However, in pre-flooding and post-flooding conditions, the accuracy difference was more than 15%, indicating that SVM is more suitable for water body and flood detection (Otsu: 0.77, SVM: 0.92). Based on the findings of this study, it is anticipated that more accurate detection of water bodies and floods could contribute to minimizing flood-related damages and losses."

Based on this new ontology and worldview, posthuman qualitative research has developed as an approach to understanding the complex entanglements of humans, technology, environment, and animals in contemporary society. Despite the advancement of posthuman discourse, there is a notable lack of concrete and practical discussions on posthuman qualitative research methodologies in Korea. This study aims to present posthuman qualitative research methodologies for educational research, categorized by key intellectual traditions. The traditions include posthuman ethnography, posthuman life history research, posthuman phenomenology, posthuman action research, posthuman ethnomethodology, posthuman autoethnography, posthuman critical qualitative research. This research discusses what posthuman qualitative research methodologies entail within each intellectual tradition and their intended purposes. Furthermore, by presenting and analyzing specific examples from each tradition, the study seeks to aid researchers in understanding and utilizing posthuman qualitative research methodologies. Given the integration of advanced machines and technology in everyday learning and education in Korea, as well as the significant interest in posthumanism among Korean educational researchers, this study is expected to provide more concrete and practical methodological guidance."

With technological advancements overcoming the limitations of medical AI through training with databases, AI technology has made remarkable progress since the inception of deep learning for image processing with convolutional neural networks (CNN) in 2012. The recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have accelerated the utilization of AI through sophisticated natural language processing, enabling machines to identify and understand data regardless of the complexity of the language. This has laid the foundation for the rapid and precise development of generative AI. In the era where generative AI is being utilized without pausing in its developmental speed, we considered the civil liability of AI in our civil law principles, taking into account the inherent characteristics of AI such as unpredictability, opacity, and the black box effect.To do this, we first examined the legal liability considering the stages of AI technology development in discussing the tort liability caused by AI. Even “Weak AI,” created by AI developers, may fall under “Gefahr,” and while not all types, some may apply to strict liability in terms of risk liability. Furthermore, while reviewing civil liability applicable to AI under fault-based and no-fault liability, we also looked at the trends in the EU comparatively.In discussing no-fault liability, particularly under the Product Liability Act, we examined the possibility and implications of applying risk liability to pharmaceutical manufacturing using generative AI technology as a representative example to overcome the limitations of the existing Product Liability Act. Humanity currently lives in an era of rapid technological development and exploding big data, enjoying numerous benefits due to these advancements. As user convenience improves and massive added value is created through technological progress, the meaning of risk liability in the realm of civil liability can gain more significance. Generative AI has already drastically reduced the costs and time required for new drug development, providing substantial profits to pharmaceutical companies. However, even if the existing Product Liability Act is applied, it may be difficult to adequately remedy the harm to victims due to the reasonable alternative possibility defense regarding design defects. In the era of generative AI, we examined the possibility of applying enhanced risk liability by assuming the case of pharmaceutical manufacturing."

This legislative change focuses on developing new evaluation criteria and methodologies for the safety, efficacy, and quality of innovative products through research and development projects. These efforts aim to support the commercialization of products from the early stages of development and to cultivate professional personnel, enabling the new evaluation criteria to be utilized by regulatory authorities and industry alike. While Korea’s regulatory science legislation has been relatively late compared to other countries, this development is significant in establishing the institutional foundation for its operation.Under the Regulatory Science Innovation Act for Food and Drugs, “Regulatory Science for Food, Drugs, etc.” is explicitly defined as the science concerning the technologies, standards, and approaches for the comprehensive safety management of food, drugs, and other related items, including their evaluation for safety, efficacy, quality, and performance, as well as their authorization, approval, and use. However, the Regulatory Science Innovation Act does not explicitly address research and development support for alternatives to animal testing, the use of artificial intelligence(AI) and machine learning(ML), or data management. The law only stipulates that evaluation criteria reflecting regulatory science, such as those for the safety, efficacy, and quality of innovative products, may be disclosed as part of commercialization support. However, there is a pressing need to promote research support for alternative testing methods, as well as for new tools, standards, and approaches. Concrete support for the research and development of modernized testing methods to replace animal testing must also be prioritized.To implement regulatory science, scientific tools and systems for data collection and analysis are needed to study data, people, health systems, and communities. Advancements in life sciences, big data, AI, and omics technologies are driving a predictive and data-driven approach to regulation, and it is crucial to integrate and balance regulation and innovation. The ultimate goal is to achieve the rapid approval of innovative products based on data throughout the entire product development process, streamline regulatory processes, and maximize efficiency and outcomes."

Its significance is increasingly recognized due to its ability to reflect the diverse characteristics of urban environments. In the case of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), the unique political system and social ideology are deeply embedded in urban spaces and society, making it difficult to fully understand the conditions through socioeconomic indicators alone. Therefore, analyzing urban vitality is essential for gaining a deeper understanding of DPRK. This study aims to estimate a regional-level urban vitality indicator that captures the dynamic characteristics of cities in DPRK and to analyze the country’s urban vitality based on this indicator. To achieve this, urban vitality indicators were defined using socioeconomic data from Republic of Korea, and machine learning techniques were applied to estimate the urban vitality indicators for DPRK. A qualitative analysis of DPRK was then conducted based on the estimated values of these indicators. The results of this study demonstrate that areas with higher urban vitality in DPRK are typically those where government-led developments have occurred, while regions with lower urban vitality are primarily agricultural areas, islands, and mountainous regions with limited accessibility. Furthermore, the study found that the actual nighttime power supply is insufficient when compared to the infrastructure levels in major cities of DPRK. The methodology proposed in this study can be expanded to other inaccessible regions, including the DPRK. Therefore, the urban vitality derived from this study is expected to be useful for policymaking in the DPRK and other restricted regions in the future."

The development of AI models/systems and the use of copyrighted works by developers/providers in the training process may constitute direct copyright infringement, ironically, it may be difficult to conclude that the AI model and/or its output created through this series of training processes are infringing works in the above direct infringement conducts. This is a big difference from the situation where conventional copyright infringement is usually accompanied by the presence of infringing works. Therefore, it is also requested to consider whether it is necessary to expand to a certain degree the subject matter and/or scope of traditional reproduction rights in consideration of the social and technological context in which generative AI has emerged. Not impossibly, as alleged by the rights holders in some cases in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, a normative interpretation is possible that ‘even if a copyrighted work used as training data is embodied in an algorithm or mathematical expressions, if it results in the same result as being copied and stored in the AI model itself, this is also tantamount to copying the work’. In addition, from the case of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, we found the following implications: (1) “Difficulties in collecting evidence and jumbling between the parties”, (2) “Difficulties due to the technical characteristics of machine learning(especially in the difficulty of identifying infringed works)”, (3) “Unprofitableness of DMCA and/or CMI(Copyright Management Information)”, and (4) “Reduction of the issues in infringement litigation to the issue of substantial similarity.” With these practical issues in mind, it is necessary to pay attention to the outcome of the cases of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California."

리니언시 제도의 딜레마와 합리적인 제도 운용 방안,2024,"['리니언시', '자진신고자 감면제도', '카르텔', '담합', '부당공동행위', '담합주도자', 'Leniency', 'Voluntary reporting exemption system', 'Cartel', 'Collusion', 'collusion leader', 'Initiator']",,"Cartels are formed through secret collusion among cartel participants, so they tend to leave no evidence behind, and it is difficult for competition authorities to collect information. Accordingly, major countries' competition laws, including 「Korea's Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act」, operate a leniency program that provides benefits for sanctions to voluntary reporters, when participating companies voluntarily report unfair joint practices or provide evidence by cooperating with investigations. Competition authorities' assessment of the effectiveness of the leniency program is very positive.The leniency program, by design, induces cooperation among collusion participants, making it easier for competition authorities to detect and investigate collusion, and at the same time, it provides significant incentives to apply for leniency by exempting or reducing corrective measures, fines, and other sanctions for businesses that voluntarily report. Therefore, businesses calculate the benefits they will receive from applying for leniency or the reduced risk of collusion detection before applying for leniency, and may even attempt to use the leniency program or, at times, use it irregularly, to obtain immunity.On the other hand, in reality, in order to receive the benefits of the leniency program, it is necessary to possess sufficient evidence to prove collusion. However, since businesses that led collusion inevitably have more relevant evidence than businesses that simply participated in collusion, there is a fundamental problem that businesses that led collusion are more likely to receive a reduction in penalties. In addition, even when considering the level of sanctions from the Korea Fair Trade Commission when collusion is detected and the comprehensive risk considering the difficult subsequent legal regulations, it can be seen that the leader has a greater incentive to voluntarily report. However, there is a problem that the predictability of the application of leniency may be low because there is a lot of room for discretion in the interpretation of what a ‘leading role’ is in collusion.Recalling that the core of the leniency program is ‘having an opportunity to stop or prevent unfair joint acts through leniency,’ it is necessary to carefully consider whether the effect of suppressing collusion is greater when allowing leniency for the leader or when limiting leniency.Recently, as collusion methods have become more sophisticated and are being carried out covertly, the need for a leniency program has increased in order to detect anti-competitive collusion, and in this situation, absolutely blocking the use of leniency by the collusion leader may not be an appropriate method for regulating cartel. Therefore, in principle, applications for leniency by the collusion leaders should be permitted, but in cases where the collusion leaders voluntarily report with dishonest intentions or irregular methods, it would be more reasonable to regulate them by establishing separate regulations.In addition, rather than relying solely on leniency when detecting collusion by competition authorities, it would be necessary to utilize IT technologies that can create synergy with the leniency program, data analysis, and machine learning techniques to enhance collusion detection techniques, and to appropriately utilize the reporting individual reward program."
연구개발과정에서 인공지능 기술의 조력으로 인한 진보성 요건 기준의 변화- 미국특허법의 비자명성(non-obviousness) 요건을 중심으로 -,2024,"['인공지능', '특허권', '진보성', '비자명성', '통상의 지식을 가진 자', '용이도출', '시도자명', '연구개발', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Patent Right', 'Inventive Step', 'Non-Obviousness', 'A Person Having Ordinary Skill in the Art', 'Easily-Derived', 'Obvious to Try', 'Research and Development']","진보성 요건은 성공의 보장이 없는 모험적이고 예측 불가능한 기술적 발전, 즉 혁신적인 기술의 발전을 이룬 자들에게 특허라는 독점권으로 보상을 주기 위해 만들어진 법리이다. 진보성을 규정하고 있는 미국 특허법 제103조와 우리나라 특허법 제29조 제2항에 의거하여 청구된 발명이 해당 기술의 통상의 지식을 가진 자에게 자명하거나 쉽게 도출될 수 있다면 이는 특허를 받을 정도의 혁신적인 발명이 아니기에 특허를 받을 수 없다. 인공지능 기술의 도움으로 인간의 능력을 넘어서는 결과물이 나오는 연구개발 패러다임 전환의 시대를 맞아 진보성 요건이 요구하는 혁신적인 개선 정도에 인공지능 기술로 인해 증강된 연구개발 능력을 반영시키는 시도가 필요한 시점이다. 이에 맞추어 진보성 요건의 기준인 ‘통상의 지식을 가진 자’와 ‘자명’ 또는 ‘용이도출’에 대한 새로운 이해와 조정의 필요성에 대해 논의해 보았다. 현재 인공지능 기술이 연구자를 도와 연구개발과정의 효율성을 높이는 기능을 수행하고 있지만, 아직은 연구자의 창조와 창작 역할을대체하는 수준이 아니라는 가정하에 본 연구를 진행한다.우리나라와 미국은 2007년 미국 연방대법원이 KSR 판결을 통해 확립시킨 자신의 창의력, 상식, 배경지식, 익숙한 도구를 활용해서 퍼즐을 맞추듯 선행기술의 가르침을 결합할 수 있는 능력자로 ‘통상의 지식을 가진 자’를 동일하게 정의하고 있다. 통상의 지식을가진 자의 기술 수준을 판단할 때 인공지능 기술이 해당 분야에서 통상적이고 일상적으로 사용되고 있다면 인공지능 기술을 사용하는 통상의 기술자로 기술 수준이 정해져야할 것이다. 하지만, 현재 연구개발 환경에서는 연구자의 인공지능 작업 능력에 따라 결과물의 수준이 달라지기 때문에 발명자의 탁월한 인공지능 기술의 선택과 활용을 ‘인공지능을 활용하는 통상의 지식을 가진 자’로 동일시할 수 없다.연구개발과정에서 적극적으로 활용되는 인공지능 기술로 인해 ‘자명’ 또는 ‘용이도출’ 의 기준이 어떻게 조정되어야 하는지에 대해 연구해 보았다. 미국의 경우 KSR 판결을통해 통상의 기술자가 출원일 당시에 발명자가 찾은 해결안, 즉 청구된 발명을 찾을 수있다는 합리적인 기대가 있어야 자명하다는 기준을 확립시켰다. 연구개발 과정에서 아무리 뛰어난 인공지능 기술을 활용했다고 해도 발명의 진보성에는 연구개발의 결과물의혁신성만 고려하는 것이지, 혁신적인 인공지능 기술의 활용은 반영하지 않는다. 또한 미국 특허청 심사지침에는 KSR 판결 이후 시도자명(obvious to try)을 자명한 결합의 예로들고 있으나, 1980년대의 미국 판례에서 인공지능의 기계학습 과정과 일치하는 상황을정확하게 지목하며 시도자명에 해당하지 않는다는 결론을 내렸다. 우리나라 특허청 심사지침은 용이도출 판단의 근거가 되는 여러 상황을 설명하였지만, 인공지능 기술을 활용하는 경우 용이도출의 근거들을 쉽게 피해갈 수 있게 되었다. 현재는 인공지능의 활용으로 창출된 발명에 대해 진보성 요건의 기준이 특별하게 높은 상황은 아니지만, 추후 해당 영역에 선행기술이 촘촘히 자리를 잡게 되어 혁신의 영역이 없어지거나, 특허의 질과수에 대한 제어가 필요한 경우, 현행 특허제도에서 진보성 요건의 기준을 필요에 따라 조정할 수 있는 능력을 이미 자체적으로 갖추고 있다는 결론을 내린다.","The non-obviousness or inventive step requirement is a legal principle established to reward those who achieve innovative technological advancements with the exclusive rights of a patent, recognizing the risky and unpredictable nature of such works.According to Section 103 of the U.S. Patent Act and Article 29(2) of the Korean Patent Act, an invention is not eligible for a patent if it is considered ‘obvious’ or ‘easily-derived’ by a person having ordinary skill in the relevant field (‘PHOSITA’). As we enter an era of paradigm shifts in research and development, facilitated by artificial intelligence (‘AI’) technologies producing outcomes beyond human capabilities, there is a need to reflect the enhanced research and development capabilities brought about by AI in the degree of improvement required by the non-obviousness criterion. In this context, the study discusses the need for a new understanding and adjustment of the concepts of the ‘PHOSITA’ and what is considered ‘obvious’ or ‘easily-derived’. While current AI technologies assist researchers by increasing the efficiency of the R&D process, this study proceeds on the assumption that AI has not yet reached a level where it can replace the creative and inventive roles of human researchers.In both Korea and the United States, the definition of a ‘PHOSITA’ is aligned, referring to a hypothetical person who uses his/her creativity, common sense, background knowledge, and familiar tools to combine prior art teachings like solving a puzzle. This definition was established through the KSR decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.When assessing the skill level of an ordinary technician, if AI technology is commonly and routinely used in that field, the skill level should be adjusted to an ordinary technician who uses AI technology.However, with current technology, the level of outcomes varies depending on the researcher’s AI proficiency. Therefore, the exceptional AI skills of an inventor cannot be equated with the abilities of a ‘PHOSITA’ who uses AI.This study also examines how the criteria for ‘obviousness’ or ‘easily-derived’ should be adjusted due to the active use of AI technology in the R&D process. In the United States, the KSR decision established that an invention is considered obvious if there is a reasonable expectation that a person of ordinary skill in the art could find the solution identified by the inventor at the time of the patent application. Regardless of how advanced AI technology used in the R&D process might be, the assessment of an invention’s non-obviousness considers only the innovation of the research output, not the innovative use of AI technology. Furthermore, as superior search capabilities of AI technology are utilized in the research and development process, all outcomes can be verified and predicted to a certain extent, making them an ‘obvious to try’ technology with a reasonable chance of success. However, according to a 1980s U.S. case law, situations corresponding to the machine learning processes of AI were specifically identified and concluded not to meet the ‘obvious to try’ standard. The examination guidelines of the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) describe various situations that serve as the basis for determining ‘easily-derived’, but when utilizing AI technology, it has become easy to circumvent these bases for ‘easily-derived’. Currently, the non-obviousness requirement is not particularly difficult for inventions created with the help of AI technology. However, if innovative inventions are pouring out with the help of AI technology, prior arts in this field will quickly become densely populated, leaving no room for further innovation. Or if there arises a need to control the quality and quantity of patents covering such inventions, the current patent system already has the internal capability to adjust the standards for the non-obviousness or the invent..."
