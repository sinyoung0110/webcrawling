The existing literature on factory location has concentrated on piecewise analysis based on historical data, which is constrained by the inability to integrate time series and spatial data. To address this issue, we have developed a hybrid model that combines a Markov-CA model, which is capable of reflecting spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously, with LightGBM's high-performance binary classification algorithm. In particular, the concept of ""continuous directional restrictiveness"" is introduced as a means of controlling the bias of spatial scaling and of optimising the performance of the model through hyperparameter optimisation using Optuna. The model was thus able to effectively reflect the influence of external factors affecting the location decision, utilising solely the coordinate data of past factory locations. Furthermore, optimised parameter values for 10 major factors were derived. Furthermore, the implementation of the ""continuous directional constraint"" can regulate the expansion tendency of the existing CA model. It is anticipated that the hybrid model proposed in this study will serve as a decision-support tool, offering practical assistance to local governments in the planning of industrial parks, companies in the selection of locations, and governments in the formulation of industrial policies."

Currently, fruit sweetness is primarily measured through destructive methods, while non-destructive sweetness meters are limited by partial measurement and surface damage. This study performed regression and time series analyses to predict tomato sweetness using intelligent smart farm datasets from AI Hub. We conducted regression analysis using XGBoost and LightGBM, and time series analysis using LSTM. In the experimental results, regression models recorded negative R² values with high error rates. In contrast, time series analysis using LSTM achieved an acceptable prediction error of MAE 0.224 compared to the typical range of tomato sweetness. This suggests that tomato sweetness is closely related to time series characteristics throughout the growth period. This study demonstrates the feasibility of practical non-destructive sweetness prediction using the LSTM model and is significant in validating the effectiveness of time series analysis techniques for predicting tomato sweetness."

Methods: The language development screening test used in this study was developed so that parents could respond directly online, and a total of 453 parents participated in the screening test. Additionally, 226 randomly generated responses were created using a random number generator. According to the criteria set by the researchers, the response types were categorized into sufficient effort responses, insufficient effort responses, and randomly generated responses. Various machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, LightGBM, and MLP, were used to train the response data, and the accuracy of the model was assessed using K-fold cross-validation. Results: Based on the established criteria, the responses were classified as 220 sufficient effort responses, 233 insufficient effort responses, and 226 randomly generated responses. The ensemble voting demonstrated a high accuracy of approximately 89.7% in detecting insufficient effort responses and randomly generated responses, effectively classifying parents’ insufficient effort responses. Conclusion: The machine-learning-based approach proposed in this study can be effectively utilized not only in web-based language screening for infants and toddlers but also in detecting insufficient effort responses in self-reported surveys. This approach is expected to enhance the reliability of research data and facilitate more accurate assessments."

It focuses on the radiation field classification, performance quotient evaluation, and shallow and deep dose equivalent assessment of ANN and LGBM, in comparison to the traditional method of DT. We evaluate these algorithms based on the element response data measured by TLD. A data set was built for training, and the base element responses of test categories were amplified, and normalized to 1 mSv Cs-137 within the range of ±3 %. Both algorithms consist of five subset models for classifying radiation fields and identifying ratios of mixed fields. The LGBM showed the best accuracy in classifying considered radiation fields and the lowest performance quotients.By comparing the tolerance levels of deep dose and shallow dose equivalents among the three algorithms, the LGBM yields the smallest difference between the predicted and true dose equivalents. This smaller difference implies the LGBM offers the least bias and standard deviation in the expected value, giving higher accuracy and precision in dose assessment over the traditional DT method. The findings from this study further contribute to the adoption of ML-based algorithms for TL dose assessment, underscoring its importance in the field."

Comparative Analysis of Gradient-Boosting Ensembles for Estimation of Compressive Strength of Quaternary Blend Concrete,2024,"['Compressive strength', 'Quaternary blend concrete', 'Gradient-boosting algorithms', 'Ensemble machine learning']",,"Concrete compressive strength is usually determined 28 days after casting via crushing of samples. However, the design strength may not be achieved after this time-consuming and tedious process. While the use of machine learning (ML) and other computational intelligence methods have become increasingly common in recent years, findings from pertinent literatures show that the gradient-boosting ensemble models mostly outperform comparative methods while also allowing interpretable model. Contrary to comparison with other model types that has dominated existing studies, this study centres on a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance of four widely used gradient-boosting ensemble implementations [namely, gradient-boosting regressor, light gradient-boosting model (LightGBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and CatBoost] for estimation of the compressive strength of quaternary blend concrete. Given components of cement, Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), Fly Ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate in addition to the age of each concrete mixture as input features, the performance of each model based on R2, RMSE, MAPE and MAE across varying training–test ratios generally show a decreasing trend in model performance as test partition increases. Overall, the test results showed that CatBoost outperformed the other models with R2, RMSE, MAE and MAPE values of 0.9838, 2.0709, 1.5966 and 0.0629, respectively, with further statistical analysis showing the significance of these results. Although the age of each concrete mixture was found to be the most important input feature for all four boosting models, sensitivity analysis of each model shows that the compressive strength of the mixtures does increase significantly after 100 days. Finally, a comparison of the performance with results from different ML-based methods in pertinent literature further shows the superiority of CatBoost over reported the methods."

Prediction of RC T-Beams Shear Strength Based on Machine Learning,2024,"['Reinforced concrete T-beams', 'Shear strength', 'Machine learning (ML)', 'Extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost)', 'Decision tree model (DT)', 'Random forest model (RF)']",,"The contribution of shear resisted by flanges of T-beams is usually ignored in the shear design models even though it was proven by many experimental studies that the shear strength of T-beams is higher than that of equivalent rectangular cross-sections. Ignoring such a contribution result in a very conservative and uneconomical design. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate the capability of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the shear capacity of reinforced concrete T-beams (RCTBs) by incorporating the contribution of the flange. Five machine learning (ML) techniques, which are the Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), are trained and tested using 360 sets of data collected from experimental studies. Among the various machine learning models evaluated, the XGBoost model demonstrated exceptional reliability and precision, achieving an R-squared value of 99.10%. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach is utilized to identify the most influential input features affecting the predicted shear capacity of RCTBs. The SHAP results indicate that the shear span-to-depth ratio (a/d) has the most significant effect on the shear capacity of RCTBs, followed by the ratio of shear reinforcement multiplied by the yield strength of shear reinforcement (), flange thickness (), and flange width (). The accuracy of the XGBoost model in predicting the shear capacity of RCTBs is compared with established codes of practice (ACI 318-19, BS 8110-1:1997, EN 1992-1-2, CSA23.3-04) and existing formulas from researchers. This comparison reinforces the superior reliability and accuracy of the machine learning approach compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface platform is developed, effectively simplifying the implementation of the proposed machine-learning model. The reliability analysis is performed to determine the value of the resistance reduction factor (ϕ) that will achieve a target reliability index (= 3.5)."

This study aims to develop binary like fatality and injury and multi-class such as fall and struck-by classification models using AutoML to predict the occurrence and types of construction accidents, based on data from the Construction Safety Integrated Management System (CSI) database. The dataset, consisting of 235,665 accident cases from January 2019 to February 2024, includes 54 types of information, with 18 influential accident factors identified. Preprocessed data were trained and tested using AutoML to determine optimal algorithms and influencing factors. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics were used for validation. The binary classification model for predicting fatalities and injuries, developed using the Extra Trees (ET) algorithm, achieved the highest accuracy of 95.9% and an F1 score of 0.2771. For predicting accident types, the multi-class classification model using the LightGBM (LGBM) algorithm recorded the highest accuracy of 57.4% and an F1 score of 0.5503. Feature importance analysis revealed that the accident object was the most critical factor in both models. This research is expected to enhance safety management performance by efficiently identifying the likelihood and types of construction accidents."
자율차와 일반차 혼재된 교통상황에서 Lv.4 자율차의 자율주행 지원을 위한 AI 기반의 빅데이터 분류체계 구축에 관한 연구,2024,"['Traffic management index', 'autonomous vehicle', 'mixed traffic situation', 'data classification system', 'AI modeling']",,"PURPOSES : For autonomous vehicles, abnormal situations, such as sudden changes in driving speed and sudden stops, may occur when they leave the operational design domain. This may adversely affect the overall traffic flow by affecting not only autonomous vehicles but also the driving environment of manual vehicles. Therefore, to minimize the traffic problems and adverse effects that may occur in mixed traffic situations involving manual and autonomous vehicles, an autonomous vehicle driving support system based on traffic operation optimization is required. The main purpose of this study was to build a big-data-classification system by specifying data classification to support the self-driving of Lv.4 autonomous vehicles and matching it with spatio-temporal data.METHODS : The research methodology is explained through a review of related literature, and a traffic management index and big-dataclassification system were built. After collecting and mapping the ITS history traffic information data of an actual Living Lab city, the data were classified using the traffic management indexing method. An AI-based model was used to automatically classify traffic management indices for real-time driving support of Lv.4 autonomous vehicles.RESULTS : By evaluating the AI-based model performance using the test data from the Living Lab city, it was confirmed that the data indexing accuracy was more than 98% for the KNN, Random Forest, LightGBM, and CatBoost algorithms, but not for Logistics Regression.The data were severely unbalanced, and it was necessary to classify very low probability nonconformities; therefore, precision is also important. All four algorithms showed similarly good performances in terms of accuracy.CONCLUSIONS : This paper presents a method for efficient data classification by developing a traffic management index to easily fuse and analyze traffic data collected from various institutions and big data collected from autonomous vehicles. Additionally, EdgeRSU is presented to support the driving of Lv.4 autonomous vehicles in mixed autonomous and manual vehicles traffic situations. Finally, a database was established by classifying data automatically indexed through AI-based models to quickly collect and use data in real-time in large quantities."
