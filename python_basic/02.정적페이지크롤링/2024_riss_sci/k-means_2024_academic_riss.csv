감귤 속성 선호도에 대한 K-MEANS 군집분석 및 잠재계층분석(LCA),2024,"['Citrus', 'Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis', 'K-means Clustering', 'Latent Class Analysis', '감귤', '선택기반 컨조인트 분석', 'K-means', '잠재계층로짓분석', '혼합로짓모형']","본 연구는 Lancaster의 소비자 특성수요이론에 따라 감귤을 속성으로 구분하여 감귤 속성에 대한 소비자 선호도를 이해하고 소비자의 선호 속성 수준에 따라 소비자를 군집화하는 데 목표를 둔다. 이를 위해 감귤의 무게, 크기, 가격, 포장 등 네 가지 속성에 대한 선택 기반 컨조인트 설문조사를 통해 200명의 응답자로부터 데이터를 수집하였으며, K-MEANS 군집분석과 잠재계층분석 등 두 가지 기법으로 소비자를 군집화하고 두 군집 결과를 비교하였다. K-MEANS 군집분석을 수행하기에 앞서 혼합로짓모형으로 개인별 효용 계수와 지불의사가격을 추정하고 주성분 분석(PCA)을 통해 차원을 축소하였다.  K-MEANS 군집분석 및 잠재계층분석으로 각각 3개의 집단으로 군집화한 후 분석 결과 두 군집분석 결과 간에 적당한 일치도를 가지고 결과 간 공유하는 정보는 많지 않았다. 전반적으로 약간의 유사성은 있지만 다른 결과를 나타냈다. K-means 군집분석은 다수의 속성에 대한 선호도를 동시에 고려하여 명확한 소비자 그룹을 식별하였고, LCA는 다양한 속성 조합을 선호하는 소비자 집단을 식별하였다. 본 연구 결과는 향후 감귤 시장에서의 소비자 선호를 더욱 정확하게 이해하고, 이를 바탕으로 효과적인 마케팅 전략을 수립하는 데 활용될 수 있다.","This study aims to understand consumer preferences for citrus by segmenting them based on their attributes according to Lancaster's consumer theory. Data was collected from 200 respondents through a choice-based conjoint survey that included four attributes of citrus: weight, size, price, and packaging. Consumer preferences were clustered using two techniques: K-MEANS clustering and latent class analysis. Individual utility coefficients and willingness-to-pay (WTP) were estimated using a mixed logit model before conducting K-MEANS cluster analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce dimensionality. The results of the two cluster showed some similarities but shared limitd information. K-means cluster analysis is advantageous in identifying distinct consumer groups by simultaneously considering preferences for multiple attributes, while LCA can be used to analyze consumer preferences for a wider range of attribute combinations in more detail, which is advantageous for developing customized marketing strategies targeting specific consumer groups. The results of this study can be used to better understand consumer preferences in the citrus fruit market and to develop effective marketing strategies."

K-means clustering was applied, with the optimal K value determined using the elbow method and silhouette score. The Haversine formula was used to calculate the distances between the analysis sections and weather stations, and Delaunay triangulation and inverse distance weighting (IDW) were employed to interpolate the magnitude of the influencing factors.

These extracted color features were applied to the design of virtual character clothing. First, a bilateral filtering algorithm was used to preprocess the images of Yao embroidery, reducing noise while preserving intricate details. Subsequently, Euclidean distance was calculated in the Lab color space, and the OSTU adaptive binarization method was employed to separate the image from its background. Additionally, K-means clustering was applied multiple times to the color data, and the optimal result was achieved when the number of clusters was set to eight. Through this process, eight major colors of Yao embroidery were extracted. Based on these extracted colors, 3D point cloud analysis was conducted to study the three-dimensional spatial distribution of color points, and a color combination model based on hue, brightness, and saturation was constructed. The results revealed that the color composition of Yao embroidery predominantly consists of high-saturation colors, with strong color contrasts and distinct ethnic characteristics. Ultimately, this study demonstrated the applicability of integrating the color model and design patterns of Yao embroidery into virtual character clothing design, showcasing the potential for incorporating traditional embroidery into digital design. This contributes to the preservation and promotion of intangible cultural heritage and serves as a valuable reference for further research on the color systems of traditional ethnic costumes."

However, in the case of WAV (wheelchair Accessible Vehicle), the safety that may occur in a vehicle accident is still lower than that of regular passenger seats. In particular, in the case of a rear-end collision that may occur in a defenseless situation, it can cause fatal neck injuries to disabled passengers. Therefore, a more detailed design plan must be reflected in the headrest to be applied to WAV. In this study, a multi-cell headrest was proposed to implement local compression characteristic distribution of the headrest during rear-end collision of WAV. Afterwards, a correlation analysis was performed between the passenger's NIC (Neck Injury Criterion) and impact energy absorption using the data set construction through analysis and the clustering results using k-means clustering. As a result of clustering, it was confirmed that data clusters with similar characteristics were formed, and a correlation analysis between NIC and impact energy absorption through the characteristics of each cluster was performed. As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that the softer the cell compression characteristics in Mid3 and Mid6, the more impact energy absorption increases, and the harder the cell compression characteristics in Front2, Mid3, and Mid6, the more effective it is in reducing NIC."
전역 최적화를 위한 강건한 K-means,2024,"['Data Clustering', 'Robust K-means(RK-means)', 'Initialization']",,"K-means is a popular and efficient data clustering method which is one of the most important technique in data mining. K-means is sensitive for initialization and has the possibility to be stuck in local optimum because of hill climbing clustering method. Therefore, we need a robust K-means (RK-means) not only to reduce this possibility but also to increase the probability to search the global optimal clustering solution. The objective of this paper is to propose RK-means with best initial solution from good solutions with good central data for each cluster. The central data of each cluster is selected based on Roulette wheel probabilistic selection using sum of relative distance rate of each data. They have a problem in high density data because they deterministically select the central data for just one initial solution of K-medoid. Our proposed initial solution is the good starting point to find the robust solution by K-means with reducing the possibility being stuck in local optimal solutions. The performance of proposed RK-means data clustering is validated using machine learning repository datasets (Iris, Wine, Glass, Vowel, Cloud) comparing to original K-means by experiment and analysis. Our simulation shows that RK-means using probabilistically relative distance rate are better than K-means with random initialization. The minimum squared distance by RK-means with smaller deviation is lower than that by K-means with higher deviation. RK-means is competitive comparing to data clustering methods based on simulated annealing (SA) and hybrid K-means with SA (KSA & KSAK)."

Accurate classification of CAI using the Y-Balance Test (YBT) is crucial for effective management and timely return to work.Purpose: To compare the effectiveness of K-means clustering and Youden’s J statistic in determining YBT cut-off values for classifying CAI in LWs with a history of ankle sprains.Study design: Retrospective cohort studyMethods: Data from 121 LWs with a history of ankle sprains were analyzed. YBT measures included anterior, posterolateral, and posteromedial reach distances, and composite scores. Cut-off values were determined using Youden’s J statistic and two K-means clustering approaches (Mean and Top 2). Performance metrics including area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios were calculated for each method.Results: The YBT posteromedial direction distance, using Youden’s method, demonstrated the highest discriminative ability for CAI classification (AUC: 0.62, OR: 5.41, 95% CI: 2.09–14.04). The K-means Top 2 method consistently provided higher cut-offs with improved specificity across all YBT measures, notably achieving 87% specificity for the YBT composite score (cut-off: 96.98%).Conclusions: While both methods effectively identify CAI risk, the K-means clustering approach, particularly the Top 2 method, offers higher cut-offs with improved specificity. This suggests potential benefits in occupational health settings where stringent screening criteria are necessary for early identification and management of CAI risk in LWs."

Firstly, using fundamental data of LQ45, three clusters are formed using K-Medoids clustering. K-Means and fuzzy C-Means cluster analysis were also performed as a comparison. Secondly, two stocks with the highest Sharpe ratios from each cluster were chosen to form an optimum portfolio. The optimum portfolio was obtained using non-robust (classic) and robust estimate approaches. The robust estimations used are the Fast Minimum Covariance Determinant (FMCD) and the S estimation. A robust process allows for creating the best-performing portfolio from many stocks, especially as outliers largely impact the outcomes. This study revealed that the portfolio produced by combining K-Medoids clustering and robust FMCD estimation outperformed those created using other approaches."

"A Novel Approach for Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Multi-mode Processes Based on PCA, Random Forest, and K-means Clustering",2024,"['Diagnosis', 'fault detection', 'multi-mode processes', 'random forest.']",,"The multi-mode nature of many processes poses a challenge to fault detection and diagnosis tasks, as their non-monotonous behavior renders the traditional monitoring approaches incapable of capturing such varying patterns. This study introduces the F-DINAMITE algorithm, a novel fault detection and diagnosis method incorporating principal component analysis, random forest, and k-means clustering, aiming to identify normal and faulty operational conditions while reducing false alarms and detection errors and providing fault diagnosis capabilities. The novel features of F-DINAMITE include the tailored selection of the number of clusters to minimize the false alarm rate and the automatic update of the fault database when new faults are identified. We validated the proposed method with a case study of a complex building HVAC system, where the algorithm analyzed faults in air dampers and cooling valve systems, testing its detection and diagnosis performance. Moreover, we assessed its false alarm rate while monitoring normal operation data. F-DINAMITE achieves a reduction in false alarm and misdetection rates, compared to those of conventional PCA, while successfully diagnosing faults. This methodology could significantly contribute to maintenance in complex processes by expediting fault detection and reducing associated costs. Nevertheless, future research must focus on conducting a more comprehensive assessment of F-DINAMITE’s performance with more real-life case studies or high amounts of synthetic data."
Identifying Quality Factors for Surface Defects on Small Steel Bars Using a Two-step Method of Statistical Difference Testing and k-means Clustering,2024,"['Steel manufacturing process', 'Quality improvement', 'Data mining', 'Surface defect', 'Statistical analysis', 'Factor screening']",,"Small steel bars (SSBs) are common steel products, and their surface defects pose a significant quality issue. Despite numerous studies conducted to detect and predict such defects, identifying the underlying causes, or ‘quality factors,’ remains a challenge. Most of the existing methods focused on validation of known factors based on the theories of physical properties and material composition; thus, they lack exploring new quality factors. This study proposes a two-step method for identifying these quality factors, considering two common issues that often arise when analyzing operational data in SSB manufacturing processes: ‘merged measurement’ and ‘variation due to operation dates.’ These issues are resulted because the rolling process is lack of measurement capability and exposed to external environment. They make it difficult to use various analytical methods such as statistical analysis and data mining methods. The proposed method sequentially employs statistical difference testing and k-means clustering, thereby providing a practical heuristic for overcoming the aforementioned difficulties. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated through a case study that highlighted its ability to effectively identify the quality factors critical to surface defects on SSBs."

입자 군집 최적화 알고리즘을 통한 K-평균 군집화 개선,2024,"['Unsupervised learning', 'K-means clustering', 'Particle swarm optimization', 'Silhouette score']",,"Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning, and unlike supervised learning or reinforcement learning, a target value for input value is not given. Clustering is mainly used for such unsupervised learning. One of the representative methods of such clustering is K-means clustering. Since K-means clustering is a method of determining the number of clusters and continuing to find the central point of the data allocated to the cluster, there is a problem that the clustered group may not be the optimal cluster. In this study, particle swarm optimization algorithm, which determines the motion vector by adding various variables as well as the center point, is applied to K-means clustering. The improved K-means clustering makes it possible to move toward better outcome values even when the center of cluster no longer change. In the conventional clustering method, the center of the cluster moves to the center of the data belonging to the cluster, and clustering ends when the cluster does not change, so other characteristics other than the center value are excluded. Unlike the conventional clustering method, the improved clustering method uses a central value, an average value, and a random value as variables, and a particle swarm optimization algorithm that modifies the vector for each iteration is applied. As a result, improved clustering method derived a better result value than the existing clustering method in the group's fitness index, silhouette score."

FP는 실제 특이조성을 가져 전문가분석이 필요하지만 머신러닝이 분석하는 것으로 판단된 것을 의미하기 때문에 FP가 적을수록 머신러닝 모델 적용 시 높은 분석신뢰도를 기대할 수 있다. 전문가분석의 경우 35개 중 31개 시료가 false negative로 배정되었으며, 이는 머신러닝이 분석해도 무방하나 전문가가 분석해야할 시료 수가 전체의 57%임을 의미한다. 그러나 해당 시료들을 머신러닝기반 조성분석모델로 분석할 경우 2.94%의 높은 평균절대오차의 평균을 보이기 때문에 전문가분석 군집으로 배정된 것을 합리적으로 평가할 수 있다.","Mineral composition used to identify the sedimentary environment can be obtained through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. However, due to time constraints for analyzing a large number of samples, a machine learning-based mineral composition analysis model was developed. This model demonstrated reasonable reliability for samples with usual compositions but showed poor performance for unusual samples. Consequently, a clustering model has recently been developed to classify the unusual samples, allowing experts to handle. The purpose of this study is to examine the applicability of the clustering model, developed using XRD data from the Ulleung Basin in previous study, using samples from different regions. Research data consist of intensity profile from XRD experiment and its mineral composition analysis for a total of 54 sediment samples from the Korea Plateau, located northwest of the Ulleung Basin. Because the intensity of samples in the Korea Plateau comprises 7,420 values (3.005-64.996°), differing from 3,100 values (3.01-64.99°) of samples in the Ulleung Basin, linear interpolation was used to align the input feature. Then, min-max scaler was applied to intensity profile for each sample to preserve the trend and peak ratio of the intensity.Applying the clustering model to the 54 preprocessed intensity profiles, 35 samples and 19 samples were classified into expert and machine learning groups, respectively. For machine learning group, false positive was zero among the 19 samples. This means that the clustering model can increase reliability in when mineral composition from machine learning model because unusual sample did not belong to the machine learning group. For the 35 samples in expert group, the 31 samples were classified as false negative (FN). It means that although machine learning model can properly analyze these samples, they were assigned to expert group. However, when these FN samples were analyzed using machine learning based composition analysis model, a high mean absolute error of 2.94% was observed. Therefore, it is reasonable that the samples were assigned to expert group."
K-미학으로서의 ‘멋’과 그 의미 - 조지훈의 ‘멋의 연구’를 중심으로,2024,"['Meot', 'Style', 'K-aesthetics', 'K-culture', 'Jo Ji-hoon', 'Hybrid', '멋', '한류', '풍류', '정체성', '특수성', '보편성', '혼종']","‘멋’은 한국인의 미의식을 대표하는 우리 문화, 예술의 산물이다. 이것은 멋이 우 리 민족의 삶 속에서 생성되고 향유되어 왔다는 것을 의미한다. 흔히 우리 민족을 가리켜 멋을 알고 멋을 낼 줄 아는 민족이라고 말한다. 최치원의 난랑비서(鸞郞碑序) 에 적힌 ‘풍류’라는 말이 잘 보여주듯 우리 민족은 오래 전부터 멋에 민감한 삶의 태 도를 유지해 왔다. 멋과 풍류에 대한 지향은 그에 걸맞은 문화, 예술을 낳았고, 오늘 날 전 세계인들이 열광하는 한류 혹은 K-컬처의 기반이 되었다고 할 수 있다.멋에 대한 논의는 오래전부터 있어 왔고 그것을 학술적인 차원에서 가장 깊이 있 게 고구(考究)한 이가 바로 조지훈이다. 그는 멋의 의미 구조를 형태, 표현, 정신미의 차원에서 자세히 살피고 연구함으로써 멋이 지니는 보편성과 특수성을 밝히는 데 중요한 토대를 제공하고 있다. 그가 제시한 형태, 표현, 정신미의 차원이 드러내는 각각 의 요소들 - 비정제성, 다양성, 율동성, 곡선성, 원숙성, 왜형성, 완롱성, 무실용성, 화 동성, 중절성, 낙천성 등은 멋의 특수성과 보편성을 세분화하고 구체화하고 있다는 점에서 시사하는 바가 크다.그가 제시한 이러한 사실을 통해 우리는 K-컬처로서의 멋의 정체성을 가늠해 볼 수 있다. K-컬처로서의 멋은 한국적인 특수성만으로 성립되는 것이 아니라 그것을 향유하는 세계 각지의 사람들의 참여와 생산을 통해 만들어지는 것이다. K-컬처에서 K는 더 이상 폐쇄적이고 협소한 한국성을 의미하지 않는다. 그것은 글로벌한 보편성을 바탕으로 만들어지고 발전해온 개념이다. K의 정체성이 ‘혼종’에 있다는 사실은 시사하는 바가 크다. 이것은 ‘K-미학으로서의 멋’ 역시 혼종적이어야 한다는 것을 의미한다. 진정한 혼종은 어느 한쪽으로의 흡수가 아닌 섞이는 것들 사 이의 기우뚱한 균형이나 엇박의 리듬감을 유지한 상태에서의 긴장을 말한다. 멋은 우리만의 것이 아니라 그것을 향유하는 사람 모두에게 열려 있는 미지의 ‘K’이다. 누 구든지 멋의 의미 생성에 참여하여 그것의 정체성을 만들어갈 수 있다. 이 과정에서 새로운 문화 혼종성에 기반 한 멋이 탄생하게 된다. 혼종성으로서의 K란 곧 K-미학 으로서의 멋을 말한다.","‘Meot’(Style) is a product of our culture and art that represents the aesthetic conscious- ness of Koreans. This means that the style has been created and enjoyed in the lives of our people. It is often said that our people are those who know the style and how to be stylish. As the word ‘pungryu’ written in Choi Chi-won’s Nanrangbiseo (鸞郞碑序) clearly shows, our people have maintained a lifestyle sensitive to style for a long time. It can be said that the orientation toward style and taste gave rise to appropriate culture and arts. And it became the foundation of the Korean Wave or K-culture, which people around the world are pas- sionate about today.There has been a discussion about style for a long time, and the person who studied it most deeply at an academic level is Jo Ji-hoon. By examining and studying the meaning structure of style in detail in terms of form, expression, and spiritual beauty, he provides an important foundation for revealing the universality and specificity of style. Each of the elements revealed by the dimensions of form, expression, and spiritual beauty he presented - irregularity, diversity, rhythm, curvedness, maturity, distortion, smoothness, im- practicality, harmony, neutrality, optimism, etc. It has significant implications in that it sub- divides and embodies the specificity and universality of style.Through these facts he presented, we can gauge the identity of style as K-culture. The style of K-culture is not established solely through Korean uniqueness. And it is created through the participation and production of people from all over the world who enjoy it.In K-culture, K no longer signifies closed and narrow Korean style. It is a concept that was created and developed based on global universality. The fact that K’s identity is ‘hybrid’ has significant implications. This means that ‘style as K-aesthetics’ must also be hybrid. Truehybridization refers to tension while maintaining a sense of offbeat or a tilted balance be- tween things that are mixed, rather than absorption into one side or the other. The style is not just for us, it is an unknown ‘K’ that is open to everyone who enjoys it. Anyone can participate in creating the meaning of the style and create its identity. In this process, the style based on new cultural hybridity is born. K as hybridity means the style as K-aesthetics."

K-뮤지컬이라는 용어는 CJ EnM의 설립과 동시에 공적인 장에서 언급되면서 민관에서 사용하기 시작했다. 한류의 인프라를 전략적으로 공유하여 뮤지컬의 글로벌화를 추진하던 CJ EnM은 ‘원 아시아 마켓’의 개념을 천명하며 한중일 3국 혹은 동아시아 지역 전체를 하나의 블록으로 구성하여 ‘K’를 글로벌 비즈니스의 콘텐츠로 유통시키려 했다. 동아시아지역을 하나의 뮤지컬 블록으로 상정하는 당시 ‘원 아시아 마켓’의 개념은 한국이 동아시아의 소프트웨어로서 인식되고 있는 2024 년에 실제로 구체화 되고 있다. 현재 동아시아에서 유통되는 K-뮤지컬의 개념은 한국 뮤지컬 현장의 역량과 직접적인 관계를 보이며 무엇보다 ‘한국 시장 안에서 작품성과 흥행성이 보장된’이라는 맥락을 취한다. 이는 K가 곧 ‘한국적인 것’이라는 선험적인 인식과직접적인 상관관계를 보이지 않으며 오히려 동아시아 시장에 다수 수출된 대학로의 중소극장들이 보이는 ‘상업적인 성공’과 더 밀접한 관계를 보이고 있음을 의미한다. 한편 영미권에 진출하기 위한 한국 뮤지컬들은 주로 대극장의 보수성 및 이와 관련된 보편주의를 추구하는 경향이 매우 강하며, 이를 통해 영미권 대극장 뮤지컬의 ‘쇼’적 정체성과 만나는 지점 혹은 뮤지컬의 낭만성을 고취시키는 지점에서 K의 정체성을 조율하고 있다.","This thesis deals with the historical flow and identity of K-musical as an attempt to observe and analyze the contemporary musical scene, where the transnational flow of musicals is further strengthened. The term K-musical was mentioned in the public sector when CJ EnM was established in 2011 and began to be used in the private sector as well. CJ EnM, which was promoting the globalization of musicals by strategically sharing the infrastructure of the Korean Wave, declared the concept of “One Asia Market” and tried to distribute “K” as the content of global business by forming the three countries, Korea, China, and Japan, or the entire East Asian region into one block. At the time, the concept of “One Asia Market” was assumed to be a musical block, and it was actually taking shape in 2024, when Korean musical was recognized as East Asian software. The concept of K-musical currently distributed in East Asia is directly related to the capabilities of the Korean musical field, and above all, takes on the context of “guaranteed workability and box office performance in the Korean market.” This means that “K” does not show a direct correlation with the a priori perception that it is “Korean,” but rather shows a closer relationship with the “commercial success” seen by small and medium-sized theaters in Daehakro that have been exported a lot to the East Asian market.Meanwhile, Korean musicals to advance into the Anglo-American world tend to pursue the conservatism of large theaters and related universalism, and through this, K’s identity is coordinated at the point where it meets the identity of “show” of large British American theater musicals or promotes the romanticity of musicals."

As a result, various papers have been conducted based on machine learning to identify the success factors of idols by utilizing traditional data such as music and recordings. However, there is a limitation that previous studies have not reflected the influence of new media platforms such as Instagram releases, YouTube shorts, TikTok, Twitter, etc. on the popularity of idols. Therefore, it is difficult to clarify the causal relationship of recent idol success factors because the existing studies do not consider the daily changing media trends.To solve these problems, this paper proposes a data collection system and analysis methodology for idol- related data. By developing a container-based real-time data collection automation system that reflects the specificity of idol data, we secure the stability and scalability of idol data collection and compare and analyze the clusters of successful idols through a K-Means clustering-based outlier detection model.As a result, we were able to identify commonalities among successful idols such as gender, time of success after album release, and association with new media. Through this, it is expected that we can finally plan optimal comeback promotions for each idol, album type, and comeback period to improve the chances of idol success."

After the Chinese Civil War, Fairbank and other like-minded Democrats urged the U.S. government to support the Chinese people’s “social revolution” as a means to escape political oppression and economic exploitation. Initially, these liberals aimed to foster non-communist revolutionaries within China by reviving the Third Force and reshaping Taiwan into a democratic model.However, as Mao Zedong’s rule became increasingly oppressive in the 1960s, Fairbank re-evaluated the legacy of China’s authoritarian political tradition and its enduring influence. With this renewed understanding, U.S. liberals of the Democratic Party began to see rapprochement with the PRC as the most viable path for future U.S.– China relations."

For the digital generation who grew up reading RPG (Role Playing Game) games and Harry Potter, which require building a worldview and familiarizing themselves with how to play games, the worldview of making friends and realizing self in an avatar world based on a virtual space that crosses narrative and time and space is a familiar concept. In addition, on SNS, the MZ generation is creating accounts for each of their characteristics and creating fun short-forms freely and flexibly by expressing themselves. The worldview and the multipersona have become a means and play to express myself. In order to inflow these digital generations into the fandom, the Korean entertainment industry is using the worldview to solidify the identity of idol groups and form fandom.

Until now, research on romance web novels has mostly focused on exposing the problematic nature of the romance genre or the commerciality and popularity of web novels. The study considered, when looked from the perspective of subjectivity, the changes related to the spirit of the times more important. So, as a result of comparing the cross-dressing narrative in this work with that of classic novels, it was possible to see that cross-dressing was used as a means to promote romance and, above all, it was possible to find a subject who keeps his or her desires hidden. This is the characteristic unique to romance web novels and deviates from the grammar of existing romance novels. In existing romances, there is an inherent desire to find the perfect ‘me’, and this produces the subject with authenticity. However, in Girl, Hong Gildong, such attempts are absent, and since her desire is limited only to that of the male protagonist, an infantile autistic subject who only recites love, that is, a subject of ‘post-authenticity’, is produced. The subject of ‘post-authenticity’ relies on fantasy, and this fantasy is rooted in a society that values survival and philistinism. Accordingly, the study suggested that the web novel genre should move toward producing a new subject based on imagination rather than on fantasy. It is a nomadic subject, and through ‘becoming the other’, it will be able to set the right direction for the K-narrative in line with the coming era."

The distances between histogram-valued observations are defined using the Wasserstein-Kantorovich distances to group p-dimensional histogram-valued data. Clustering is performed using the sparse k-means clustering method with the distance matrix computed for each dimension. The proposed method maximizes the weighted sums of squared distances between clusters. For various value of k, we apply the sparse k-means clustering method and determine the optimal number of clusters with the Silhouette measure. Simulation studies were conducted to compare the proposed method with the standard k-means clustering method in terms of cluster agreement and selected variables. Additionally, we analyzed real data from the monthly average temperatures of 48 US states. As a result of numerical analysis, it was confirmed that the proposed method shows superior performance and effective variable selection."

Sometimes seen as a friendly neighboring nation that migrated to the Mongolian region long ago, and at other times, as the beloved family of a beautiful wife or the revered lineage of a mother, Korea has been perceived in various ways over a long period. With a surprisingly long-standing connection, Mongolia and Korea share a deep cultural and folkloric affinity, allowing them to unravel them to unravel the mysteries of K-Culture’s past, present, and future. This unique bond is why K-Culture in Mongolia is exceptionally special on the world stage.Particularly during the Pax Mongolica era, the intimate marital ties between the Yuan Empire and Goryeo saw Goryeo women, known for their beauty, achieve a level of cultural dominance unparalleled by any other ethnicity, establishing the international stature of medieval Hallyu(韓流). These Goryeo women, even those taken as tribute women, excelled in various fields such as cuisine, fashion, and the arts, and played a role as elite experts in the Yuan Empire’s royal court. By leading contemporary cultural trends like the “Goryeo style” and “Mongol style,” they were early pioneers of global cultural exchange, facilitating the birth and spread of global K-Culture.Now, the land of rainbows, Solongos, is unequivocally aspired to be the dream society by Mongolia’s future generations. This aspiration is quickly becoming a reality within their everyday life spaces."
한국형 그릿(K-GRIT) 척도의 하위요인 간 구조적 예측경로와 삶의 의미와의 관계,2024,"['Korean version of Grit scale', 'structure development', 'meaning in life', '한국형 그릿 척도', '구조적 예측경로', '삶의 의미']",,"The purpose of this study is to examine the structural relations among the three subscales (i.e., effort-persistence, passion-enthusiasm, and passion-meaning), which comprise the Korean version of Grit (K-GRIT). Furthermore, its additional objective is to explore whether each subscale predicts the presence of meaning and the search for meaning. A total of 270 self-reported data were subjected to structure equation modeling for analyses. We found that passion-enthusiasm, effort-persistence, and effort-persistence were sequentially related implying that each subscale undergoes a corresponding development. Moreover, each of the three subscales made a distinct prediction regarding the meaning in life. Passion-meaning predicted both the presence of meaning and the search for meaning, while effort-persistence predicted the presence of meaning. Contrarily, passion-enthusiasm failed to predict any dimension of the meaning in life.The importance of the present study lies in the fact that the three subscales of the K-GRIT progress in a particular sequence and have differential predictability of the meaning in life. These findings are significant in that they can serve as a foundation for Grit interventions, taking into account the developmental progression of grit subscales."

The research is designed to assess how different levels of title comprehensibility influence consumer behavioral intentions, particularly the intention to view K-contents. Moreover, it seeks to determine if the impact of title comprehensibility level on consumer evaluations varies according to personal need for structure(NFS).Research Methods: This study conducted an experimentation method. The experimental design consisted of a between-groups experiment with a 2 (Level of Comprehensibility : low vs. high) x 2 (Need for Structure: low vs. high) design. Cell mean contrast analysis was used for hypothesis verification.Results in Research: Experimental findings indicate that intentions to watch K-movies fluctuate based on the levels of NFS. Specifically, individuals with a lower NFS exhibit increased viewing intentions for movies with lower comprehensible titles as opposed to those with higher comprehensible titles. Conversely, individuals with a higher NFS demonstrate greater viewing intentions for movies with titles of higher comprehensibility compared to those with lower comprehensibility.Research Conclusion: This research extends the application of the comprehensibility concept to the titles of K-Contents. It not only broadens the theoretical discourse on the effectiveness of key message conveyance and consumer reaction but also deepens the understanding of naming strategies for K-Contents. From a practical perspective, this investigation highlights the importance of title comprehensibility in garnering consumer interest and molding viewing intentions for content creators and marketers within the K-Content sphere. Such insights are crucial for the judicious selection of titles and the formulation of global naming strategy tailored to K-Contents."

In addition, Korean cultural contents, which are produced, distributed, and accepted through transnational capital, have been utilized hybridization strategies to spread the styles of global media and cultural industries. At the same time, we also found that it has issues of Orientalism and problematic stereotyping in terms of content or stories. By employing plural methodological approaches, mainly combining textual analysis and in-depth interviews, we were able to analyze the meanings expressed in the texts and simultaneously examine the responses of global audiences. For instance, conducting interviews with audiences from various nationalities including domestic users as well as those from China, Japan, and Turkey allowed us to understand diverse perspectives and viewpoints of global audiences towards K-content. This approach enabled us to grasp how these perspectives are negotiated, perceived, or discursively produced. One may find this study useful in providing industrial and policy implications by offering pragmatic and theoretical insights, surrounding the diffusion of K-culture."

This model facilitates the precise determination of the blossom infection timing and identification of primary inoculum sources, akin to Maryblyt, predicting flower infections and the appearance of symptoms on various plant parts, including cankers, blossoms, and shoots. Nevertheless, K-Maryblyt has undergone significant improvements: Integration of Phenology Models for both apple and pear trees, Adoption of observed or predicted hourly temperatures for Epiphytic Infection Potential (EIP) calculation, incorporation of adjusted equations resulting in reduced mean error with 10.08 degree-hours (DH) for apple and 9.28 DH for pear, introduction of a relative humidity variable for pear EIP calculation, and adaptation of modified degree-day calculation methods for expected symptoms. Since the transition to a model-based control policy in 2022, the system has disseminated 158,440 messages related to blossom control and symptom prediction to farmers and professional managers in its inaugural year. Furthermore, the system has been refined to include control messages that account for the mechanism of action of pesticides distributed to farmers in specific counties, considering flower opening conditions and weather suitability for spraying. Operating as a pivotal module within the Fire Blight Forecasting Information System (FBcastS), K-Maryblyt plays a crucial role in providing essential fire blight information to farmers, professional managers, and policymakers."

The purpose of this study is to reveal the ritualistic attributes shown in the music video 〈Unforgiven〉 and to examine the modern meaning of these ritualistic attributes. In order to compare the 〈Danggeumaegi〉 ritual as a performance of the ‘Danggeumaegi myth’ and the music video 〈Unforgiven〉 as a performance of the song ‘Unforgiven’, both are viewed from the perspective of a play by the theory of Martin Esslin’s ‘five sign systems common to all dramatic media’. We transformed the five systems into ‘(1) the outer system outside the play, (2) the performer’s action sign system, (3) the performer’s non-action sign system, (4) the visual signs other than the performer.

Despite the long gap between 〈Danggeumaegi〉 and 〈Unforgiven〉 and the formal differences in ritual and music video, both of them depict the oppression and resulting pain felt by women as the weak in a patriarchal social structure in their narrative content. It was revealed that it shows a similar ritual structure in that it reflects and attempts to resolve these problems in reality through performances such as dance and song. However, 〈Danggeumaegi〉 suggested to women that they should solve real-life problems through ‘each individual’s patience’ from masculine perspective internalized by women. 〈Unforgiven〉 is significantly different in that it reflects the perspectives of today’s young women and proposes a solution through ‘resistance through solidarity among women.’ In the end, the ritualistic nature of the music video 〈Unforgiven〉 shows that for modern Korean women, who seem to be free in everything, there is still gender discrimination and oppression of women as a “hand-down from the dark era” and the resulting pain of women. This can be interpreted to mean that a ritual function such as ‘Hanpuri’ is needed to resolve the issue."

If the current situation continues, which focuses on the economic effects it creates rather than focusing on ‘culture,’ the essence of K-culture, the wonderful cultural symbol of ‘K-culture’ will eventually decline with only its shell remaining. Therefore, the possibility of the proliferation of K-culture results in whether it is possible to restore ‘culture,’ its origin, to the center of ‘K-culture.’ At this time, the reinstatement of this culture does not simply mean that ‘Korean culture’ should be emphasized or that it should be removed from the perspective of policy and industry. The Korean culture that K-culture has lost is necessary to focus on the ‘Korean element’ in the form of fragments inside the contents and restore and expand it gradually and indirectly highlight it."

As part of the ‘2022 Sejong Academy of Culture’ project, teaching and learning using K-culture content was designed and conducted, and the pedagogical meaning was analyzed through a learner survey.Based on the character analysis of traditional Korean goblins, the characters of goblins embodied in the drama were analyzed and reflected in teaching and learning. In the introductory stage, questions about Korean goblins and dramas were presented. In the development stage, basic information on dramas, introduction of contents, characteristics and characteristics of goblins, and activities to explore the narrative structure were presented. In the final stage, intercultural activities related to learners’ own stories were presented.In order to verify the effectiveness of the teaching and learning contents, about 70 minutes of training contents and surveys were conducted on 100 learners enrolled in King Sejong Institute in Colombia. As a result of the survey, high satisfaction was shown with the subject, content, and materials of the class. In particular, positive evaluation was conducted on active interaction, acquisition of cultural knowledge, interesting learning materials, and instructor’s expertise and attitude. Improvement opinions were presented regarding the expansion of class time, improvement of PPT design, and demand for deep cultural knowledge.The fantasy of the goblin character served as a common denominator with the story tradition of Colombia, which had a positive effect on understanding and empathy.Accordingly, we believe that continuous research is needed on finding parts that can empathize with foreign learners in Korean cultural contents and dramas and how to effectively present them."

To this end, the paper provides an overview of translated Korean literary works and feminism-related books, and examines two works that have been crucial to the start of the ‘K-literature boom’ in Japan: Kim Ji-young, Born 1982 (2016, Japanese edition 2018) by Cho Nam-joo, and the special issue on ‘Korea·Feminism·Japan’ (Fall 2019) of the literary magazine Bungei, with a focus on the editors and translators involved. Furthermore, it explores the influence of gender factors on the selection and translation of texts through the specific example of We Need a Language: Feminists Don’t Keep Quiet (2016, Japanese edition 2018) by Lee Min-kyung, a representative work of the ‘feminism reboot’ era. This paper reveals that a key element in the publication of the Japanese editions of the three texts discussed is the collaboration and solidarity between female editors and translators. The translation of feminist texts can be seen as a political and practical effort to build solidarity and community based on feminist values, transcending national borders. However, the meaning and impact of this process are dynamically shaped through the interaction of diverse actors, making it an unpredictable process of cultural transfer."

Along with the recent craze for the multi-sensory experience in museums and exhibition spaces, many fragrance goods, such as perfumes, candles, diffusers, air fresheners, bath bombs, and perfume paper, have been released in order to strengthen the emotional bond with the fandom. Accordingly, this study comprehensively studies the K-POP idol scent goods released since the 2000s and examines their meaning in relation to the big 3 entertainment companies brand identity strategies. After examining the definition, role of scent marketing for K-POP goods, we diachronically and comprehensively covered all K-POP idol's official fragrant goods, and then analyzed the cases and content characteristics of three big entertainment companies (SM, YG, and HYBE). SM, as the cradle of K-POP idol culture, launched the most popular and rich scented goods, whereas YG, emphasizing its experimental artist persona, launched collectible products with signature scents, and HYBE, a latecomer in the domestic entertainment industry, has released fewer types and quantities of goods but shows a strong interest in sustainability in content and design and pursues social value. However, the fact that they are all focusing on a single (MZ) generation and single sensory-oriented products, and the lack of customization are left as future research issues. We hope that this study contributes to future research on sustainable scent goods by developing branding that functions as a space for true empathy and communication between artists (brands) and fandoms (consumers)."

Thirty five patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder joint between February 1 and March 31, 2023 were selected and retrospectively analyzed. The assessment included image evaluations based on the application of the JET technique, examining signal-to-noise ratio, mean-to-standard deviation ratio, and the occurrence of motion artifacts. In the group in which the JET technique was applied, all image evaluation parameters showed statistically significant improvements (p<0.05). Through this study, the introduction of the JET technique in shoulder joint magnetic resonance imaging examinations was found not only to reduce motion artifacts, but also to enhance image quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and mean-to-standard deviation ratio. These results suggest that the JET technique can be beneficial in terms of acquiring shoulder joint images and may contribute to broader applications in various anatomical regions."

In recent years, the impact of K-pop fandom's voluntary gifting activities through global media platforms on the globalization of K-pop industries has been studied from the perspective of fandom economics. The exchange of fan creations among K-pop fans without expecting any economic reward, the celebrations they organize for band-related anniversaries, and their donations and volunteer activities are understood as ""promotional labor” that (re)produces K-pop's brand value. In terms of ""gift” theory, anthropology and cultural studies have historically evaluated art and cultural production as ""free gifts” aimed at mutual recognition and social solidarity rather than transaction and exchange. Similarly, recipient studies in media have explored the cultural impact of gifting activities as the productive consumption of fandom and the potential for their empowerment as active recipients. More recently, however, it has also been understood as irrational and ostentatious consumption and has become a social issue that requires an in-depth examination of its complex nature. Therefore, this study conducted in-depth interviews with 10 people who have been involved in gifting activities in K-pop fandom for a long time to discuss the socio-cultural meaning of gift exchange in terms of qualitative research."

By analyzing the interaction between modern popular culture and ancient religious texts, this research seeks to investigate how the narrative of the biblical wilderness can be reinterpreted and received by contemporary youth. Contents and Method: This study analyzes the image of 'KWANGYA' as depicted in the worldviews of Korean pop songs by artists such as Lee Yuk-sa, Kim Min-ki, and aespa. It examines how this image connects with the symbolic aspects of the biblical wilderness. In the Bible, the wilderness is a space symbolizing trials and overcoming, spiritual growth and self-discovery, and the coexistence of chaos and order. These characteristics are observed not only in Lee Yuk-sa's poem 'Wilderness' during the Japanese colonial period but also in the imagery of the wilderness in the 1970s-80s folk songs and 2020s K-Pop songs. In particular, in K-Pop, the wilderness is utilized as a symbolic space where protagonists undergo and overcome various challenges and trials, leading to spiritual growth and self-discovery. This study aims to explore the possibilities of how the biblical wilderness narrative can be newly received by contemporary youth through this interaction between modern popular culture and ancient religious texts.  Conlusion: The wilderness in K-Pop symbolizes the trials, self-discovery, and spiritual growth experienced by youth, encapsulating the process of finding order within chaos, much like the biblical wilderness. This research contributes to understanding how popular culture and religious symbolism interact to create contemporary meaning, showing how the message of the Bible is reinterpreted and received in today's culture. Based on these findings, it is suggested that Christian education today should consider reinterpreting and utilizing biblical symbols within new cultural contexts."

After confirming the basic information of the research participants and analyzing the original data by categorizing husband violence, wife violence, parental violence, and child violence into 4 categories based on criminal history and domestic violence incident factors, 3 categories and 73 meaning contents were derived. This study attempted to identify the factors of anxiety, self-differentiation, triangular relationships, and family projection processes through qualitative content analysis studies on experiences of violence. The research results are as follows:. First, as the anxiety of domestic violence offenders decreased and violence decreased without emotional reflex behavior, the previously undifferentiated level of self-differentiation improved. Second, there was a positive effect of detriangulating the family triangle of domestic violence perpetrators and forming an autonomous relationship.Third, the effect of stopping violence was found as the multigenerational transfer process was interrupted due to the family projection of domestic violence offenders. Based on these results, positive results emerged where emotional stability and cyclical interaction were observed while confirming immature behaviors in the family of domestic violence perpetrators.

Nevertheless, despite that importance, historical research into pansori performance itself has been relatively overlooked within the field of pansori studies relative to text-centered studies of its literature and musical traits. Studies on the format and historical aspects of contemporary pansori performance have been relatively scarce and only recently initiated in pansori studies. However, this is insufficient compared to the prevalence of current pansori performances in various venues including festivals and pansori performers’ concerts.After examining the planning and performance of pansori post-twentieth century, this study explores representative performances garnering attention from the performing arts and pansori communities in 2023. These include performances at the Jeonju International Sori Festival, the World Pansori Festival’s Pansori 20-hour Relay Project commemorating the 20th anniversary of UNESCO listing, and the K-VOX Festival held in Paris, France. These cases confirm that the various pansori performances held in 2023 shared a focus on wanchang(full-length) format performance, master, middle-aged master, young master, novice, and global performers in their planning. Such designed reinvigorated and expanded the concert performance of pansori and confirmed the performances’ effective preservation of the meaning and festivity of the pansori concert, thereby expanding the participation of various performers and audiences. Pansori as contemporary performing art is made possible by the existence of the “sori-pan”(pansori concert), through modern planning, imbued with a contemporary imagination and performing a timely role. This study, which began with the reorganization of contemporary pansori history from the perspective of performance planning, argues the necessity of contemporary research into pansori performance studies, emphasizing the need to expand them text-centered research to the dynamics of planning, performance, and appreciation."

After examining Gypsy performers’ reworkings of the Rákóczi music as illustrated in the verbunkos repertoire, this study discusses how Liszt adopted the main features of the Gypsy model while (re)creating his own version in an artistic manner through the case of his Hungarian Rhapsodies. Consequently, all of the discussions help to shed light on the significance of Liszt’s use of Rákóczi as a critical response to the existing verbunkos repertoire, as part of his contemporary heroic Hungarian March, and as a pursuit of creative arrangement."

By political perspective, I mean the perspective of 'political theology' as distinguished from liberal politics, and I argue that this perspective allows for a different understanding of the literary field and Lee Kwang-soo in the early to mid-1920s than has been previously understood. From the perspective of today's literary field, Lee Kwang-soo was a unique and major player in the literary field at the time, regardless of his will, but if Lee Kwang-soo rejected the institution of the literary field itself, that is, he rejected “competition” and carried out a plan to eliminate “enemies of the people”, Lee Kwang-soo should be read not as one of the many actors who constituted the literary scene established by the Dongin generation in the 1920s, but as another major actor who competed with the literary scene established by the Dongin generation and produced a new scene in the history of Korean literature in the 1920s. This paper will argue that Lee Kwang-soo's activities in the early to mid-1920s after his return to Korea are not 'regressive' but highly 'political' (theological), and offer a new way of understanding the literary practice of his time."
The Meaning of Spiritual Capacity (indriya) in Awakening and Cultivation,2024,"['Spiritual capacity (indriya', '根機)', 'Chan/Sŏn 禪', 'Jiao/Kyo 敎', 'sudden (頓) and gradual (漸)', 'Chinul 知訥']",,"Spiritual capacity/faculty (genji, Kor. kŭn’gi 根機, Skt. indriya), a soteriological term referring to a Buddhist adept’s religious aptitude for cultivating the path, is usually presented in three sequential levels—superior, intermediate, and inferior. The distinct levels of the spiritual capacity are commonly viewed as hierarchical, and consequently, the awakening and cultivation experienced by adepts with different levels of spiritual capacity also tend to be considered to have hierarchical implications. For instance, in the East Asian Buddhist tradition, Chan/Sŏn 禪, a meditative approach that transcends linguistic understanding and intellectual knowledge, is typically seen as suited for those with superior or sharp spiritual capacity. In contrast, Jiao/Kyo 敎, which emphasizes doctrinal study based on scriptural learning, is viewed as an approach for those with inferior or dull capacity. This distinction in spiritual capacities have been connected not only to Chan/Sŏn and Jiao/Kyo but also to the soteriological approaches, namely, sudden (dun, Kor. ton 頓) and gradual (jian, Kor. chŏm 漸), which have often been associated with each. Ultimately, this distinction has led to a tendency to regard Chan/Sŏn as superior to Jiao/Kyo, and the sudden approach superior to the gradual. However, it is necessary to reconsider this prevailing view, since, strictly speaking, the fact that the methods of cultivation and awakening differ according to spiritual capacity is a separate issue from the hierarchy of these soteriological methods. In fact, Korean Sŏn masters, such as Pojo Chinul 普照知訥 (1158–1210), was well aware of the differences in the soteriological approaches based on the varying capacities of practitioners but did not view these methods hierarchically, instead advocating for practices like the sudden awakening followed by gradual cultivation (Kor. tono chŏmsu 頓悟漸修). This paper examines Chinul’s stance, which embraces both the sudden and gradual approaches, as well as Sŏn and Kyo, against the backdrop of contemporary debates in Korea regarding sudden and gradual. Through an analysis of Chinul’s works, such as Excerpts from the “Dharma Collection and Special Practice Record” with Personal Notes (Pŏpchip pyŏrhaengnok chŏryo pyŏngip sagi 法集別行錄節要幷入私記) and Resolving Doubts About Observing the Meditative Topic (Kanhwa kyŏrŭi non 看話決疑論), this study aims to elucidate the significance of the differences in spiritual capacity in relation to awakening and cultivation."

Before modern times, manure was one of the important resources in Korean society, centered on agriculture. Thus, this paper explores the evolving cultural understanding and practical utility of human waste in agricultural practices. The latter part examines Kim Dong-in’s fictional excursus on excrement to illustrate the shifts in attitudes and practices. Specifically, it analyzes the novel as an expression of resistance against the hygiene policy made during the Japanese colonial era and at the same time as a colonial appropriation juxtaposed with divergent logics of modernity and urbanization alongside a new health regime that became preoccupied with the problem of excrement. This study draws on the significant aforementioned studies to analyze Kim’s use of the grotesque and scientific discovery to scrutinize excess, marginality, and cultural feelings of shame and disgust, exposing the contradictions of modern colonial society and identity."

Labor-management relations in Korea have been gradually improving since 2004, with disputes decreasing and instances of labor-management cooperation increasing. Nevertheless, labor-management relations are causing conflict. It cannot be said that the conflicting labor-management relationship has been completely resolved and a win-win, cooperative labor-management relationship has been formed.Germany attempted to expand the internal flexibility of existing employees rather than expanding the so-called external flexibility due to institutional reform of the labor market, and this was effective, and what made it possible was Germany's corporatism, or cooperative labor-management relationship, which worked well.Thanks to Germany's constant innovation and maintenance of the institutional framework for social dialogue, Germany has advanced economically and socially even in an unfriendly environment. Conflicts in German society are becoming more acute, and gaps and disparities between groups are growing.However, this does not mean that there has been a social rift. Germany is the only country in the world that is enjoying a boom and is achieving results close to full employment in terms of employment. However, research on what cooperative labor-management relations mean and what methods and measures are needed to transform them into cooperative labor-management relations are still insufficient. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the elements of corporatism and make related suggestions through theoretical research on cooperative labor-management relations.To summarize this study, cooperative labor-management relations and corporatism are based on mutual trust between labor and management and human-centered management. e For labor-management stability, labor and management cooperate, information has to be shared through a transparent management participation system and extensive dialogue and participation."

In the case of the K-means method, the elbow method and silhouette score were used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K). Moreover, in the case of the mean-shift method, Scott’s rule of thumb and Silverman’s rule of thumb were used to determine the optimal cluster bandwidth.RESULTS : The optimal cluster sets were selected for the rut depth (RD), annual average daily traffic (AADT), and annual maximum temperature (AMT) for each clustering technique, and their similarities with the original data were investigated. Additionally, the correlation improvement between the dependent and independent variables were investigated by calculating the clustering score (CS). Consequently, the K-means method was selected as the optimal clustering technique for the preprocessing of PMS data. The K-means method improved the correlations of more variables with the dependent variable compared to the mean-shift method. The correlations of the variables related to high temperature—such as the annual temperature change, summer days, and heat wave days—were improved in the case wherein the AMT, a climate factor, was used as an independent variable in the K-means clustering method.CONCLUSIONS : The applicability of the clustering methods to preprocessing of PMS data was identified in this study. Improvements in the pavement performance prediction model developed using traditional statistical methods may be identified by developing a model using clustering techniques in a future study."

The CS-DSTLC transmitter performs channel shuffling by finding the optimal shuffling matrix that maximizes the received signal-to-noise ratio among total K shuffling matrices. For the correct de-shuffling at the receiver, the shuffling index can be feed-forwarded from the transmitter or estimated by the k-means clustering algorithm. However, feed-forward and k-means clustering-based de-shuffling methods degrade the data rate due to signaling overhead and shuffling errors, respectively. In this work, considering the signaling overhead and shuffling error rate, a CS-DSTLC system data rate model is designed. The optimal number of shuffling matrices K and de-shuffling methods are then suggested. Simulation results show that the data rate can be maximized using the feed-forward-based method in high-order modulation, yet the k-means clustering-based method achieves a higher data rate in low-order modulation. Also, it is verified that the data rate enhancement can be improved by choosing an optimal K for a given frame length."

As a result of the analysis, the trend of research on inclusivity can be divided into three periods: the first period (2001-2010), when policy discussions were concentrated; the second period (2011-2014), when various research fields such as society, policy, culture, and economics were diversified and developed; and the third period (2015-present), when inclusivity research has rapidly increased and has been firmly established as an independent research field. Next, through topic modeling analysis using machine learning, we found that research on inclusivity is composed of seven topics: 'Regional and urban,' 'Financial and digital technology,' 'Organizational leadership,' 'Education and culture,' 'Civic community,' 'North-South reunification,' and 'Economic growth and welfare.' Of these, the Civic Community topic accounted for the largest proportion. Finally, K-Means++ analysis determined each topic comprising a 'social inclusivity' cluster, a 'policy' cluster, and a 'subtopic' cluster. The conclusions revealed that the social inclusion perspective is the most dominant, that policy content, not just civic engagement and inclusive cities, is important to realize inclusion, and that research on inclusion is developing as a diverse topic influenced by political and social changes."

Conventional risk assessment predominantly relies on subjective expert judgment, resulting in issues of consistency and reliability. To mitigate these limitations, this study applies dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), followed by K-means clustering, to classify new risk levels. The clustering results using PCA demonstrated more distinct cluster separation compared to LDA, and also showed superior performance in terms of the silhouette coefficient and other clustering metrics. This suggests that the existing risk level labels may not adequately capture the underlying data structure. Furthermore, the inconsistency observed between LDA-based clustering results and current risk labels indicates potential reliability issues in the present labeling approach. To resolve this, new risk levels were assigned using PCA and K-means clustering, with cluster risk levels evaluated based on risk scores. A quantitative analysis of key risk factors was also conducted to establish criteria for risk classification and assess the impact of each variable on the different risk levels. This study proposes a data-driven, objective, and quantitative approach to risk level evaluation, aiming to improve the efficiency and reliability of road slope management."

Quantitative analysis of color in urban environments is a complex process that has been difficult to implement in the past. However, with recent rapid advances in Machine Learning, it has become possible to analyze city colors using photos shared by tourists. This study selected Dali City, a popular tourist destination in China, as a case study. Photos of Dali City shared by tourists were collected, and a method to measure large-scale city colors was explored by combining machine learning techniques. Specifically, the DeepLabv3+ model was first applied to perform a semantic segmentation of tourist sharing photos based on the ADE20k dataset, thereby separating artificial elements in the photos. Next, the K-means clustering algorithm was used to extract colors from the artificial elements in Dali City, and an adjacency matrix was constructed to analyze the correlations between the dominant colors. The research results indicate that the main color of the artificial elements in Dali City has the highest percentage of orange-grey. Furthermore, gray tones are often used in combination with other colors. The results indicated that local ethnic and Buddhist cultures influence the color characteristics of artificial elements in Dali City. This research provides a new method of color analysis, and the results not only help Dali City to shape an urban color image that meets the expectations of tourists but also provide reference materials for future urban color planning in Dali City."

After selecting the cluster head, the entrance of a spiteful node occurs in the cluster. The THDCNN is proposed for classifying a cluster node as i) a black hole attack node or ii) a normal node. If a black hole attack node is found, the attack node information is communicated to an individual CH, which makes a final decision. Otherwise, the standard node data is encrypted with the enhanced identity-based encryption algorithm. Finally, the proposed method prevents the normal node data from the attacker. Thus, the proposed method attains higher accuracy and lower computational time than other methods."

The approach involves pre-constructing clusters based on chapter similarity to reduce computational load during recommendations, thereby improving processing speed, and applying GNN to the graph of clusters as nodes to enhance recommendation accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the use of GNN resulted in an approximate 19.7% increase in recommendation accuracy, as measured by the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric, and an approximate 27.7% increase in precision defined by similarities. These findings are expected to contribute to the development of a learning system that recommends more suitable video chapters in response to learners queries."

The procedure for conducting this study was as follows: First, this study investigated various examples of LOD definitions. Second, BIM LODs were clustered into similar levels using random number generation for the initial classification and K-means clustering analysis. Third, the definitions of the BIM LOD stages were standardized using the sentence extraction summarization method through NLP (Natural Language Processing). Fourth, the validity of the standardized BIM LOD definitions was evaluated through TF-IDF and cosine similarity analysis, showing approximately 3.7% improvement in performance.

Rapidly  growing  countries, including China and India, demonstrate high growth rates but face challenges related to  resource  management  and  environmental  sustainability.  Low-efficiency  countries, such  as  Bangladesh  and  Brazil,  are  characterized  by  low  per  capita  fisheries production  and  require  capacity  building,  infrastructure  development,  and  technical support to improve fisheries efficiency. This clustering approach offers a data-driven foundation  for  designing  targeted  strategies  to  enhance  food  security  and  promote sustainable  fisheries  development.  Future  research  should  consider  incorporating additional  economic,  social,  and  environmental  factors  to  provide  a  more comprehensive analysis"

However, in the L-C interoperation training conducted in 2022, there was an attempt to integrate the entity-level model of the KCTC system (L-system) with the unit-level model of the ChangJo-21 model (C-system). Each entity data generated on the L-system battlefield was transmitted to the C-system in the form of aggregated unit information (unit center point coordinates and unit combat power) at the divisional level. This arithmetic mean logic imposed limitations on the training. In other words, there were cases where unit center points were calculated in places where there were no actual entities or where entities could not move. This situation created unrealistic situation in the intelligence assets and firepower assets operated within the C-system. In this study, we explore three aspects of the interoperation approach to enhance the practicality of division-level LVC training to be applied after 2027. Firstly, we verify the feasibility of simulating entity(squad) in the ChangJo-21 model. Secondly, we propose a logic for calculating unit center point coordinates by applying the K-Means algorithm instead of arithmetic mean, and finally, we suggest an approach to distinguish center point coordinate calculation rules based on branches."

This anthropometric data is widely used to diagnose consumer body shapes and develop optimal clothing sizes. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, excels in predicting such body shape classifications. This study seeks to enhance the suitability of clothing design by applying the new analytical methodology of machine learning techniques to better capture and classify the unique body shapes of Korean women.In this study, machine learning techniques such as K-means clustering, Silhouette analysis, and Decision Tree analysis were used to classify the lower body shapes of Korean women in their twenties and identify standard body shapes useful for slacks design. The results showed that the lower body of the age group could be classified into three categories: 'small stature' (the majority), 'tall with an average lower body volume,' and 'medium height with a fuller lower body' (the smallest share). The three-cluster approach is validated through Silhouette analysis, which minimizes misclassification.Decision Tree analysis then further defines the criteria for these clusters, highlighting waist height and hip depth as the most significant factors, achieving a classification accuracy of 90.6%. While this study is not directly related to Robotic Process Automation, its detailed analysis of body shapes for slacks patterns can aid RPA in clothing production. Future research should continue integrating machine learning in human body and fashion design studies."

This helps to identify groups of pressure regulators with similar environmental conditions and pressure patterns, which can then be used as a foundation for establishing common maintenance strategies. For the clustering approach, k-means clustering was employed. DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) was used as distance measures. The Elbow method and Silhouette Coefficient were used to evaluate the models’ performance.

This integration enables artificial intelligence to autonomously perform the majority of driving tasks. However, autonomous vehicles currently obtain temporary driving permits, allowing them to operate on roads if they meet minimum criteria for autonomous judgment abilities set by individual countries. When autonomous vehicles become more widespread in the future, it is anticipated that buyers may not have high confidence in the ability of these vehicles to avoid hazardous situations due to the limitations of temporary driving permits. In this study, we propose a method for grading the judgment abilities of autonomous vehicles based on a driving simulator experiment comparing and evaluating drivers' abilities to avoid hazardous situations. The goal is to derive evaluation criteria that allow for grading based on specific scenarios and to propose a framework for grading autonomous vehicles. Thirty adults (25 males and 5 females) participated in the driving simulator experiment. The analysis of the experimental results involved K-means cluster analysis and independent sample t-tests, confirming the possibility of classifying the judgment abilities of autonomous vehicles and the statistical significance of such classifications. Enhancing confidence in the risk-avoidance capabilities of autonomous vehicles in future hazardous situations could be a significant contribution of this research."

This study classified the cultivation zone of soybean using weather indices as a prior study to classify the agroclimatic zone of soybean. Meteorological factors affecting soybeans were determined through correlation analysis over a 10 year period (from 2013 to 2022) using data from the Miryang and Suwon regions collected from the soybean yield trial database of the Rural Development Administration, Korea and the meteorological database of the Korea Meteorological Administration. The correlation between growth characteristics and the minimum temperature, daily temperature range, and precipitation were high during the vegetative growth stages. Moreover, the correlation between yield components and the maximum temperature, daily temperature range, and precipitation were high during the reproductive growth stages. As a result of k-means clustering, soybean cultivation zones were divided into three zones. Zone 1 was the central inland region and southern Gyeonggi-do; Zone 2 was the southern part of the west coast, the southern part of the east coast, and the South Sea; and Zone 3 included parts of eastern Gyeonggi-do, Gangwon-do, and areas with high altitudes. Zone 1, which has a wide latitude range, was further subdivided into three cultivation zones. The results of this study may provide useful information for estimating agrometeorological characteristics and predicting the success of soybean cultivation in South Korea."

However, the high variability inherent in wind is a challenge that hinders stable power generation. To utilize wind power as a primary energy source, integration with a polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) system is proposed. Yet, PEMWE is known to suff er from degradation when exposed to input power patterns with high variability.This poses challenges to its commercialization. This necessitates stress testing with various wind power fl uctuations during the production process of the devices. This study investigates representative patterns of wind power fl uctuation so that these patterns can be used for the stress testing process. We employ data-mining techniques, including the swing door algorithm and k-means clustering, to identify these patterns by analyzing wind power generation data at a 10-s interval. As a result, the fi ve most representative wind power ramps are presented. This study provides practical guidelines for the development process of expensive devices for wind power generation, thereby promoting the active utilization of wind power generation."

Previous researchers argue that tathāgatagarbha was identified with ālayavijñāna in order to correct tīrthaka's śāśvata-dṛṣṭi. In my view, their argument is based on the Yogācara school's interpretation of śūnyatā. Yogācara school interprets śūnyatā of ālayavijñāna as acitta without perception. However, in Laṅkāvatārasūtra, the interpretation of Yogācara school is regarded as uccheda-dṛṣṭi claiming the extinction of ālayavijñāna․tathāgatagarbha.Yogācara school interprets śūnyatā of ālayavijñāna in two ways. In Bodhisattvabhūmi, correctly identified śūnyatā and incorrectly identified śūnyatā are presented. The correctly identified śūnyatā means that the object itself has no linguistic expression, and the incorrectly identified śūnyatā means that there is no linguistic expression and no object. In Madhyāntavibhāgabhāṣya and Triṃśikāvijñaptibhāṣya, the first śūnyatā means that the mind itself has no object, and the second śūnyatā means that there is no object and no mind. In particular, Vasubandhu interprets staying in śūnyatā․vijñaptimātratva as acitta without perception.In the scriptures describing tathāgatagarbha, the śūnyatā of tathāgatagarbha is interpreted in two meanings. In Ratnagotravibhāga, śūnya and aśūnya are described. śūnya means that there is no kleśa in tathāgatagarbha, and aśūnya means that there is buddhadhātu․wisdom in tathāgatagarbha. Similarly, in Laṅkāvatārasūtra, it is mentioned that śūnyatā means that ālayavijñāna․tathāgatagarbha itself does not have kleśa, but has wisdom. In Laṅkāvatārasūtra, it is pointed out that it is only tīrthaka's uccheda-dṛṣṭi that the Yogācara school interprets staying in śūnyatā․vijñaptimātratva as the extinction of ālayavijñāna․tathāgatagarbha, that is, acitta.According to this study, it can be seen that Laṅkāvatārasūtra, known as a scripture that combines the vijñaptimātra thought and the tathāgatagarbha thought, is a scripture made with the tathāgatagarbha thought as the core teaching rather than the vijñaptimātra thought."

Chapter 5 of The first volum of Xici starts with Tao, talks about goodness and virtue, and ends with definitions of Divination(占) and God.First, in Chapter 2, the discussion centered on the Tao of ‘Once Yin and once Yang are called Tao,’ and ‘Shin, that is, that which cannot measure Yin and Yang is called God.’ The Tao, which is the action of Yin and Yang, is connected to the four functions of the Heavenly Way, where Yin and Yang are separated by the principle of nine uses in the Luoshu(洛書). God, whose Yin and Yang are immeasurable, is the five elements principle of human path unfolding in the human world, and represents the principle of five uses and six elements of the Hetu(河圖).In addition, the dynamic meaning of events and events, which is the fundamental problem of the Book of Changes, was examined. Divination, one of the ways of the saints, has Bu(卜) and Shi(筮). Bu refers to the Luoshu, and Shi is connected to the Hetu. Therefore, divination is not about predicting an individual's future, but rather it is an act of realizing and putting into practice the numerical principles of Luoshu and Hetu.In Chapter 3, goodness, love(仁) and knowledge(知), and the virtue and work of a gentleman are discussed. First, it was revealed that the Yin-Yang principle was internalized as human goodness and revealed as love and knowledge. Second, human nature is revealed through the four virtues, and it is virtue and business that the nobleman, who is the practitioner of the Four Virtuous Principles, realizes royal politics.In addition, love is paired with virtue and means the way of K'un(坤), and knowledge is connected to business and corresponds to the way of Ch'ien(乾), so it can be seen that they are in a relationship of body use. The gentleman realizes the virtue of Ch'ien-K'un and achieves the great work of enriching the human world.In Chapter 4, we discussed the constantly changing aspect of ‘birth and rebirth is called I(易)’, and considered that the way of transformation was represented as the way of Ch'ien-K'un. The sage's realization of the way of heaven and earth and his proclamation of the way of human beings is Ch'ien, and the realization of the guidance revealed by the sage is K'un. The Providence of change through birth is rebirth, which means the rebirth of personal life as well as physical birth."

A study on how to utilize smart containers based on the sharing economy,2024,"['Smart container', 'Sharing economy', 'Container share', 'Cluster analysis', 'K-means']",,"Technological advancements have driven a digital transformation in the container shipping industry, leading to the development of smart containers equipped with low-cost tracking and monitoring devices. These containers offer enhanced efficiency, security, and sustainability across the supply chain; however, their high cost hinders widespread adoption. This study proposes the sharing of smart containers as a solution and empirically demonstrates a method for clustering shipping companies-potential smart container customers-into groups to improve feasibility. Data from the websites of 26 South Korean shipping companies were collected and analyzed using SPSS’s k-means algorithm. The analysis revealed three clusters: Cluster 1, consisting of profitable companies near major ports with high capital and asset ratios; Cluster 2, with companies near ports- higher economic performance; and Cluster 3, located in the metropolitan area with medium profitability. The study suggests that cluster analysis can help government bodies and associations target smart container demand, providing foundational data for shared container storage systems."

The customer cluster analysis method was utilized to analyze customer purchase patterns and segment them into customer groups with similar characteristics. Data was collected from orders placed over one year in 2023 at ‘Jeonbuk Saengsaeng Market’, the official online shopping mall for agricultural, fish, and livestock products of Jeonbuk Special Self-Governing Province. K-means clustering was conducted by creating variables such as ‘TotalPrice’ and ‘ElapsedDays’ for analysis. The study identified four customer groups, and their main characteristics. Furthermore, regions corresponding to customer groups were analyzed using pivot tables. This facilitated the proposal of a marketing strategy tailored to each group’s characteristics and the establishment of an efficient online shopping mall marketing strategy. This study is significant as it departs from the traditional reliance on the intuition of the person in charge to operate a shopping mall, instead establishing a shopping mall marketing strategy through objective and scientific big data analysis. The implementation of the marketing strategy outlined in this study is expected to enhance customer satisfaction and boost sales."

The difference between each cluster was statistically significant. Policy implications and suggestions for further research are discussed based on the results of this study."
Primary Factors and Synoptic Pattern Classification of Mega Asian Dust Storms in Korea,2024,['Asian Dust Storms (ADSs) · Principal Component Analysis (PCA) · K-means Clustering · Meteorological Drivers'],,"High concentration Asian Dust Storms (ADSs) significantly impact health and economic activities by increasing atmospheric particulate matter. This study aims to understand the mechanisms, migration paths, and activity patterns of ADSs, which are essential for issuing timely warnings and aiding in atmospheric environment research. Using unsupervised learning methods, including the principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering, we analyzed the mega ADS events from 2002 to 2022 based on the ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data. We identified key meteorological factors, including geopotential height and temperature at lower levels (800–1000 hPa), and classified synoptic patterns associated to the mega ADSs during the origination stages in the source regions and the peak concentration stages in Korea. Findings highlight that, during the origination stage, enhanced troughs and high temperature at low levels are primary factors affecting atmospheric instability and consequently strong updrafts that lift dust particles, combined with high planetary boundary layer heights, ranging 1400─2950 m, and strong pressure gradients at the source regions. It is further noted that low-level temperature and specific humidity are critical during the peak stages in Korea, with contributions from higher atmospheric levels. Variability in atmospheric conditions among different patterns affects dust concentrations, with certain patterns experiencing sharp declines in humidity leading to peak dust events. Noting also that the mega ADSs occur under specific synoptic patterns classified at both the origination stages and the peak concentration stages in Korea, this comprehensive analysis provides crucial insights into the dynamics and prediction of mega ADSs in Korea."
준지도 학습 기반의 미세조직 이미지 분할,2024,"['Image segmentation', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'Segment anything model', 'K-means clustering']",,"In order to solve problems such as data collection and expensive labeling work, we proposed an image segmentation model using semi-supervised and unsupervised learning methods. Since semi-supervised learning is used, high performance can be achieved even in situations with little ground truth. The proposed model consists of a segmentation module and a cluster module. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is used for the segmentation module. The cluster module uses the k-means clustering algorithm, a representative method of unsupervised learning, to determine whether components belong to the same class within the microbial image. Finally, by configuring a user interface, the system was created to return all objects and corresponding components belonging to the same cluster when the user selects an element that wants to be divided. Both the segmentation module and the cluster module can use semi-supervised or unsupervised learning to reduce the cost of work such as data collection and labeling, which has been a problem with the existing image segmentation model."

Particularly, in September 2024, despite a sharp decline in transaction volume, the highest average apartment sales price was recorded in Seoul. However, this variability of the housing market differs regionally. This study aims to identify and characterize housing submarkets within the Seoul metropolitan area based on time-series apartment sales price indices for the past decade. To do this, monthly apartment sales price index data from 2014 to 2024 are collected at the district level in the Seoul metropolitan area. Utilizing Self-Organizing Map, the price fluctuation over time is mapped onto a two-dimensional space to generate time series graphs. Then, clustering analysis based on the Dynamic Time Warping distance, including K-means and HDBSCAN is conducted to identify distinct housing submarkets. The results indicate that apartment transaction prices in the metropolitan area have consistently risen since 2014, with a dramatic surge starting in 2020, followed by a sharp decline in 2022. However, the price fluctuations’ degree, pattern, and speed varied by region. Ultimately, five distinct submarkets were identified: stepwise variable cluster (Gyeonggi regions near Seoul), short-term variable cluster (northern and southern Gyeonggi regions), stabilized cluster (western Gyeonggi region), underdeveloped peripheral cluster (metropolitan outskirts and border areas), and continuously rising cluster (Seoul and adjacent Gyeonggi regions). This study is expected to contribute to developing effective region-specific housing policies by empirically identifying apartment housing submarkets with sensitive price variability of the Seoul metropolitan area and providing an understanding of unique spatiotemporal patterns of submarkets."
RFM Weight Analysis for Customer Segmentation in Coffee Sector,2024,"['Customer Segmentation', 'Customer Relationship Management(CRM)', 'RFM Model', 'Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP)', 'K-Means Clustering']",,"This study proposed a method using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to derive RFM weights suitable for the characteristics of each industry, and compared and analyzed this with the existing traditional RFM weighting method using customer data from CompWany C, an actual coffee franchise company. AHP has the advantage of being able to calculate weights based on the subjective judgment of evaluators, so it can quantitatively express quatlitative factors. Since evaluators belong to the industry, it can effectively reflect the characteristics of the industry. In this study, customers were subdivided through the K-Means Clustering algorithm using the RFM score, and the quality of the cluster according to the two weighting methods was compared. As a result of the study, it was confirmed that the proposed weight derivation method showed higher cluster quality than the existing traditional method, and that the segmentation suitable for the coffee industry was made. Future research requires empirical research through quantitative expansion of customer data, advancement of the preprocessing process for RFM variables, improvement of the AHP stage, and application of various machine learning techniques"

The research confirms that these two characters are polyphonic, exhibiting different phonological forms depending on their meanings. Despite variations in the pronunciation of these characters across different historical records, we have identified the most representative pronunciations that were widely used across various periods and regions.For ‘蠰,’ the analysis reveals that the character can denote different meanings such as ‘mulberry longhorn beetle (齧桑),’ ‘mantis (螗蜋),’ and ‘grasshopper (土螽),’ each associated with distinct phonological forms. In the mainstream Chinese phonological system, ‘蠰’ is pronounced with the yáng rhyme, kāikǒu, shū initial, and departing tone when it means ‘mulberry longhorn beetle,’ with the táng rhyme, kāikǒu, ní initial, and level tone when it means ‘mantis,’ and with the yáng rhyme, kāikǒu, rì initial, rising tone when it means ‘grasshopper.’ In the Sino-Korean pronuncation system, these are correspondingly pronounced as ‘sang,’ ‘nang,’ and ‘yang.’For ‘䏖,’ it was found that the pronunciation varies according the meaning: the zhēn rhyme, yǐ initial (rising/departing tone) corresponds to ‘muscles around the spine (脊肉)’ while the zhēn rhyme, chéng initial (rising tone) corresponds to ‘scar (瘢).’ In Sino-Korean pronunciation system, the zhēn rhyme, yǐ initial corresponds to the pronunciation ‘in,’ and the zhēn rhyme, chéng initial corresponds to ‘jin.’ Therefore, in Korean, ‘䏖’ should be pronounced as ‘in’ when referring to ‘muscles around the spine’ and as ‘jin’ when referring to a ‘scar.’"

For this purpose, four clustering algorithms - Agglomerative hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, Gaussian mixture model clustering, and DBSCAN - were utilized with data collected from 434 students at a university in Seoul. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering revealed two clusters, with one group showing higher development levels across all key competencies and the other exhibiting competencies below the average. Similarly, k-means clustering identified an optimal two-cluster solution. In contrast, Gaussian mixture model clustering and DBSCAN suggested a single cluster. Internal validity indices, such as the Davies-Bouldin index and the silhouette coefficient, favored k-means clustering with two clusters. Significantly, k-means clustering demonstrated higher stability compared to agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Consequently, this study selected k-means clustering with two clusters as the most suitable algorithm for the dataset, categorizing students into ‘Proficient’ and ‘Advanced’ groups."

Materials and Methods: We prospectively enrolled 65 patients with TAO (41 active, 82 eyes; 24 inactive, 48 eyes). Twenty-two active patients completed the GC treatment and follow-up assessment, including 15 patients (30 eyes) and 7 patients (14 eyes), defined as responsive and unresponsive, respectively. Model-free (time to peak [TTP], area under the curve [AUC], and Slope<sub>max</sub>) and model-based (K<sup>trans</sup>, K<sub>ep</sub>, and V<sub>e</sub>) parameters of EOMs in embedded simplified histogram analyses were calculated and compared between groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent predictors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance. Results: Active patients exhibited significantly higher TTP at the 10th percentile (-10th), TTP-mean, and TTP at the 90th percentile (-90th); AUC-10th, AUC-mean, AUC-90th, and AUC-max; K<sup>trans</sup>-10th and K<sup>trans</sup>-mean; and V<sub>e</sub>-10th, V<sub>e</sub>-mean, V<sub>e</sub>-90th, and V<sub>e</sub>-max than inactive patients (P < 0.05). Responsive patients exhibited significantly lower TTP-min; higher K<sup>trans</sup>-mean and K<sup>trans</sup>-max; and higher K<sub>ep</sub>-10th, K<sub>ep</sub>-mean, and K<sub>ep</sub>-max than unresponsive patients (P < 0.05). TTP-mean and V<sub>e</sub>-mean were independent variables for determining disease activity (P = 0.017 and 0.022, respectively). A combination of the two parameters could determine active TAO with moderate performance (AUROC = 0.687). TTP-min and K<sup>trans</sup>-mean were independent predictors of the response to GCs (P = 0.023 and 0.004, respectively), uniting which could determine the response to GCs with decent performance (AUROC = 0.821). Conclusion: DCE-MRI-derived model-free and model-based parameters of EOMs can assist in the evaluation of TAO. In particular, TTP-mean and V<sub>e</sub>-mean could be useful for determining the activity of TAO, whereas TTP-min and K<sup>trans</sup>-mean could be promising biomarkers for determining the response to GCs."

Donghak is the beginning of modern Korean society because it is based on the modern awareness that people are great beings who serve heaven. Suun Choi Je-woo, the founder of Donghak, instilled a new world view and pride in Koreans by insisting on the banner of national independence when the legitimacy and ideology of our people were under threat amidst a sense of crisis in the Sersedongjerm. In particular, what Suun paid attention to was to set the people as the subject of the national movement and induce their awareness.Suun’s Donghak has a deeper meaning because the thoughts of Sicheonju, Sain Yeocheon, and Innaecheon are a compilation of Korean thought and a presentation of direction. The spirit of Donghak contained the unique spirit of our people that our people have preserved and practiced for thousands of years, and this was a factor that allowed it to be easily adapted and accepted by the people. When harmony and harmony are said to be the main contents of Korean thought, Hongik Ingan’s idea of heaven on earth, Wonhyo’s idea of peace, Jogye-Jong of monk Jinul of Goryeo Dynasty Buddhism, and the ideas of Toegye and Yulgok, who overcame the theoretical conflict of Joseon Neo-Confucianism, all reflect the Korean spirit. These were cultural legacies and Korean political ideas. Donghak should also be understood in the same context.In celebration of the 200th anniversary of Suun Choi Je-woo’s birth, the tasks at the academic level are as follows. First, full-scale research is needed on why Suun Choi Je-woo is a great saint. Second, the emergence of Donghak is said to be the emergence of our modernity. Modern times are a society of self-aware individuals, and research is needed to further solidify the modernity of Donghak. Third, the Gaebyeok-gwan needs to be organized. Today, in the era of material creation, we will be able to properly understand the Donghak Revolution, Gapjin Reformation Movement, and the March 1st Revolution through research on the creation of mind, society, and heaven and earth as advocated by Donghak. Fourth, it is also necessary to organize Donghak from a humanistic, social scientific, and religious perspective. Lastly, with regard to K-culture spreading overseas, following the Korean Wave 1.0 (songs), 2.0 (drama, movies), and 3.0 (food, clothing), Korean Wave 4.0 is needed. This is because when Hallyu 4.0 refers to our thoughts, ideologies, and spiritual culture, Donghak, the most Korean ideology, will be at the center of it."

I called the phenomenon the “Korean Turn” as I observed the emulation of Korean televisual drama (nowadays called K-Drama) modes and practices by local production through various means of cultural appropriation. This time, I will expand my exploration to other aspects of Philippine entertainment and other cultural practices. I will also update my observations on the continuing “Korean turn” in the teleserye. I will argue, on the one hand, about the success and soft power of hallyu or the “Korean wave” in the Philippines; and on the other, about Philippine culture's enduring ingenuity in its reception and repurposing of hallyu. Ideas to be yielded here will form part of a potential framework in understanding the dynamics of the interface between Korean and Philippine cultures, in the context of globalization. I"

Korean nail art has also undergone significant development, further highlighting Korean culture on the global stage. From this perspective, this study aims to explore new aesthetic expressions by integrating the symbolic imagery of Minhwa(Korean folk painting), a traditional Korean cultural element, into nail art design. The research method involved first analyzing the theoretical content of Minhwa to classify its symbolic meanings into four categories: warding off evil, auspiciousness, love, and wishes. Appropriate Minhwa illustrations were then selected for each category. Using motifs from key subjects in Minhwa, such as Hwajodo(flower and bird paintings), Hojakdo(paintings of tigers and magpies), and Ingyeodo(paintings of carps), nail art works were created that embody contemporary formative aesthetics. These works carry unique meanings and symbolism, demonstrating that applying them in exhibition-style nail art can blend traditional significance with modern sensibilities to achieve original aesthetic expressions. In this study, symbolic elements of Minhwa were hand-painted on nail tips, replicating selected Minhwa illustrations, and displayed in the format of folding screens. This approach maximized the volume and three-dimensionality of the nail tips, enhancing the immersive experience for viewers. The focus of the nail art exhibition was to visually convey the depth of traditional art, offering viewers a novel artistic experience. The findings of this study reveal that applying the symbolic imagery of Minhwa to nail art design and presenting it through folding screen-style exhibitions not only reinterprets Minhwa as an artistic value beyond simple nail art but also suggests new possibilities and directions for nail art. This study is significant in expanding the creative application of traditional cultural designs in the field of nail art."
『지장경』의 業海와 中有 관계에 대한 일고찰,2024,"['the Kṣitigarbha-sūtra', '地藏經', 'intermediate state', '中有', 'sea of karma', '業海', '49 days ritual', 'reincarnation process', '지장경', '중유', '업해', '49재', '윤회 과정']",,"Concepts of an intermediate state (中有, antarābhava) and the sea of karma (業海), which is especially emphasized together with the intermediate state in the Kṣitigarbha-sūtra (地藏經), have been used for explaining the afterlife in Buddhism. Their sapatiotemporal meaings are similar between Sectarial Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism. An intermediate state is sometimes used as a space that living things go through when moving on to the next life. It acts as a medium to inherit the seeds of karma into the next life as the subject of reincarnation. After the Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣā (阿毘達磨大毗婆沙論) in the thought ideology of the Sarvâstivāda School (說一切有部), the intermediate state is recognized as the subject of reincarnation in connection with the gandharva, the transnational being. However, after the advent of Consciousness-only theory (唯識), the intermediate state connected with the eighth consciousness, ālaya vijñāna (阿賴耶識) is used as a term to mean the meaning of reincarnation and a special space, where living things stay and the space exists in between this life and the next life during reincarnation. The concept of intermediate state is particularly expanded and developed by clearly stating that the period of living things stays here is 49 days. The sea of karma also exists in the middle of death(死有) and birth(生有). It is the place that living things must pass through on their way to hell. However, the sea of karma is a place where evil-living things experience extreme pain. Thus, it has a different spatial concept from the intermediate state. The Consciousness-only school and the Kṣitigarbha-sūtra suggest that living things stay in the intermediate state for 49 days. They possibly can be reborn to another world by the effort of themselves and other people such as family and relatives. Completely understanding the concept of intermediate state and sea of karma can positively guide attendants at the ritual such as a ritual for 49 days to direct the life of ritual attendants."

We analyzed drawings and explanatory data of 137 college students taking liberal arts courses at K University in the Jeonbuk region. Results of this study are as follows. First, for college students, housing was perceived as having various functional and symbolic meanings rather than just a physical building. In particular, the meaning of housing as an emotional place was considered the most important. Second, an ideal residential environment planned by college students was widely distributed, including interior environment, exterior of the house, and local environment. Interest in indoor environment planning continues to be at a high level. There is a significant increase in local environment plans. Third, the most common planning elements for an ideal residential environment were physical performance of the residence and planning for the surrounding environment. Surrounding environment plans saw a sharp increase in the number of plans compared to 2017, which was noteworthy. Fourth, housing value was in the order of individuality and privacy, health and comfort, location, sociability, efficiency, and aesthetics. Especially, the value of elements of neighborhood environment and sociability became important. In the future, it will be necessary to provide specific information by analyzing housing-related consciousness and values i n detail through additional quantitative and qualitative research such as surveys and in-depth interviews."

Specifically, it builds on the previous discussion titled ‘Integrating and Utilizing K-Content in Classical Korean Poetry Education’, adding an exploration of integrating classical Korean poetry with popular music, including K-pop, into the curriculum. The article also reviews research on the continuity between classical Korean poetry and popular music and discusses the direction for classical poetry education in universities based on these findings.There has been ongoing academic discussion regarding the continuity and connection between classical Korean poetry and popular music. While scholars may differ on specific details, there is a general consensus that both classical Korean poetry and popular music can be viewed as part of an ongoing tradition, where their meanings and values are interconnected. Additionally, there has been continuous discussion about applying this integration of classical Korean poetry and popular music to university education. It is worth noting that discussions and critiques of classical Korean poetry and popular music are often reported even by those outside of academic circles, but such discussions sometimes stem from misconceptions or preconceived notions about classical Korean poetry, which can lead to problematic interpretations. This highlights the need for university education that helps foster a proper understanding of both classical Korean poetry and popular music.In the classical Korean poetry course taught by the author, the integration of classical poetry and popular music was incorporated into the curriculum. The theoretical portion of the course covered the evolution of classical Korean poetry, comparisons between classical poetry and modern popular music, and the development of K-pop. To ensure the course wasn’t overly focused on theoretical learning, students were also given practical assignments. These included: ①writing critical essays on modern popular music, and ②writing comparative analyses of classical Korean poetry and popular music. The first assignment served as a precursor to the second, helping students better prepare for the comparative analysis. Through analyzing popular music, students were better able to tackle the next step: comparing and analyzing classical Korean poetry and popular music. This process was deemed to effectively help students understand classical Korean poetry in new ways and deepen their learning experience."

And the cause was analyzed from two perspectives. First, it is due to the temporal and spatial specificity of the coexistence of various Buddhist traditions in Korean Buddhism, and second, it is due to the secularization aspect of Korean Buddhism.Next, problems with the concept of K-meditation and the characteristics of Korean Buddhism's practice and practice were examined. To this end, at first reviewed at the context and limitations of the concept of K-meditation used with Seon meditation, and examined the validity of the term ‘K-Buddhist meditation’ rather than ‘K-meditation’ in terms of its use and category. Furthermore, through the characteristics shown in Korean Buddhism's belief and practice, it was discussed that the doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, social participation, and Bodhisattva practice of the spiritual culture of Korean Buddhism are the identity of Korean Buddhism. Through this, I discussed how the meaning of meditation should not be narrowly interpreted and limited to a tool for quiet inner insight or a psychological healing approach.Lastly, I discussed application cases of Seon meditation containing the implications of these Seon meditation. In Korean Buddhism, Seon meditation must have two main characteristics. First, it must proceed in a way that combines or integrates Korea's traditional Seon Buddhism and modern meditation traditions. Second, as an ideological basis, Seon quotations or Seon thoughts should be reflected. Of course, the Seon thought at this time refers to the doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism that encompasses social mindfulness, Bodhisattva practice, and altruistic practice."

To fulfill this research purpose, the study analyzed articles related to Hallyu reported in French newspapers and academic journals. The primary goals were to identify the issues that French society is focusing on and to examine the construction of meaning and the direction of societal discussions regarding these issues. The analysis focused on Hallyu-related coverage in the French press from 2011 to 2021, a period when the Hallyu phenomenon expanded from Asia to Europe. The study conducted a thorough examination of French media using keywords such as Hallyu, Korea, Korean culture, and K-pop. The results of the analysis revealed a shift from past discourses that consistently portrayed Korea as the 'land of religious converts' and a 'passive kingdom of seclusion.' Instead, in today's French media, Korea is depicted as a dynamic cultural exporter, a small but influential cultural powerhouse that acts as a subject in dynamic cultural exports and exercises global influence through soft power. In this way, French media reproduced discussions about Korean society exerting influence globally through Hallyu, constructing a strong image of Korea."

It is through the deceptive cover of “complaisant agency” that performers can stage cultural productions that are seemingly complicit in master narratives of subjugation but yet contain Trojan horses that explode with the potential to mount semiotic resistance and become a means to transgress. Counter to narratives that ascribe complicitly in the disempowerment of women to K-pop, in this paper I identify how some K-pop artists are engaged in the production of a new vision around women in Korean society."

Young author’s ambition to create a combination of ‘Künstlernovelle’ and ‘Bildungsroman’ could not be realized, as it’s well known, because of ‘Petrashevsky circle’ case. First task is to analyze the artist story of the novel; naturally our research focus is on violinist Efimov’s characteristic and destiny. The second paragraph examines ‘history of a woman’. It consists of ‘insulted and injured’ girl’s theme, two girls’ love story(Netochka and princess Katya), at last, the third chapter of Netochka’s ‘confession’ is about Aleksandra Mikhailovna and her husband. Here our heroine seems to become an observer-narrator.In conclusion, we briefly survey Dostoevsky’s obsession over ‘Bildungsroman’. The meaning of “Netochka Nezvanova”(1849)” during his process to create his own ‘roman stanovleniya’ is emphasized."

To this end, eight K middle school multicultural students were selected as participants in the study, and the interpretive implementation study suggested by McCutcheon and Jung (1990) was conducted. The results of this study can be summarized as follows. First, it is the establishment of a positive self-identity. Most of the multicultural students felt confused or perceived their identity negatively. For them, the continuous search for identity through various activities and the experience of positive stimulation led to the formation of positive self-awareness and self-identity. Second, it is the improvement of self-esteem. Multicultural students were able to experience self-directed participation in art activities and increasing their self-efficacy, and free self-expression opportunities were able to increase their interest, passion, and confidence. Third, it is communication and understanding among school members. Empathy and positive feedback made multicultural students feel emotional stability and a sense of belonging. In addition, I was able to cultivate confidence, positive self-image, and self-esteem by experiencing the interest and positive support of school members."

The K-POP industry requires specific styles, images, and high-level performances, which means that practical music education alone is insufficient to prepare students for becoming K-POP stars. As a result, the importance of research evaluating and suggesting improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of practical music education has grown, in response to the entertainment industry’s demands for additional education. This study aimed to investigate students’ perceptions and satisfaction in practical music academies in Korea and China, and to evaluate the training quality in K-POP-centered environments, focusing on idol training operations and education. The study utilized surveys to measure students’ perceptions and satisfaction, and based on these, assessed the quality of K-POP education. The analysis revealed that course content, interaction with instructors, interaction among learners, and facilities all significantly influenced students’ satisfaction. These findings highlight the importance of the quality of the educational environment and curriculum in determining students’ overall satisfaction, suggesting that practical music academies need to improve their educational programs by reflecting these factors."

The primary research method involves analyzing Tang Dynasty Chinese texts and the works of Kūkai (774-835) to understand how the concept of ‘卽’ functions and its philosophical implications. In Esoteric Buddhism, ‘卽’ largely denotes immediate or instantaneous enlightenment, implying that practitioners can attain Buddhahood directly through their current physical body. This doctrine is grounded in the idea of non-duality (不二), emphasizing that phenomena and essence, sentient beings and Buddha, are fundamentally not different. Rather than advocating for gradual cultivation or future enlightenment, Esoteric Buddhism stresses the potential to attain Buddhahood in one’s present form.This practical message, focusing on achieving enlightenment through body and mind reflection in everyday life, can offer valuable direction for modern individuals in their pursuit of personal growth and inner awakening. Additionally, this concept may be meaningfully applied to fields such as psychology and spiritual studies, suggesting that it can contribute to resolving modern social and psychological issues. Especially in today’s fast-paced world, where people seek quicker and more efficient methods, the doctrine of Sokushin Jobutsu offers a practical message that enlightenment can be attained through one’s current body and mind. This serves as a guide for inner growth, spiritual exploration, and psychological well-being, reaffirming that Esoteric Buddhist practice is directly linked to everyday life."

This paper conducts empirical analyzes to investigate whether three representative regional hollowing-out indices can effectively explain the phenomenon of regional hollowing-out. To analyze the explanatory power of these indices, three regional extinction indices are employed, focusing on three hypotheses regarding the variables decisive in regional hollowing out. As the results of the analysis, the Masuda and the K-local extinction index have some explanatory power for the decline in the natural population of the region. However, the explanation power is weak in relation to the actual registered population living in the region. The regional regeneration potential index is found to have an inverse relationship with the originally predicted relationship with the local population. It shows that it is inappropriate to explain the phenomenon of regional hollowing out. As a result, these extinction indices can give mid- to long-term meanings according to the meaning of each index in explaining the phenomenon of regional hollowing out. There is a limit to serve as an index as a guideline for government policy."

In this respect, this paper attempted to present a discussion on Cultural Contents Studies (a meta-research in a mixed method of adding quantitative research to the basis of qualitative research) by examining the situation and development of Korean cultural contents over the past 20 years. The detailed classification of Cultural Contents Studies has an inner story related to certain meanings and methodologies. Moreover, the importance of ethics about cultural contents need to be raised. It was intended to emphasize that Korean cultural contents (Korean Wave or K-culture) should play a part in promoting the diversity of global culture by allowing people around the world to enjoy Korean culture. And, it is a way to play the role of Korea in a global society. This should be regarded as the ideology of the Korean Wave or K-culture. Not only the aspect of understanding and inheriting and developing the existing traditions and history of Korea, but also the aspect of creating and developing traditions and history is important.

Accordingly, this study examined the differences by comparing the meaning of the translated concepts in Köppen’s climate classification in Korea and Japan with what was intended in the original concepts described in German. While only the concept of tree climates is described in Köppen’s writings, the concepts of treeless and tree climates are both being used in Korea and Japan. Additionally, Japan also uses a novel classification method to distinguish between forested and unforested climates. The teaching strategies recommended in this study include replacing treeless climates with nontree climates and, particularly in Japan, employing a new classification method for high forest climates and non-high forest climates. The findings highlight the need to consider the meaning and use of translated words understood in each region to effectively learn geographical concepts."

Comparative Analysis of PyTAF and kd-tree Resampling Methods for Geostationary Satellite Data: Performance and Efficiency Insights,2024,"['Resampling', 'Nearest neighbor', 'PyTAF', 'kd-tree', 'GK2A', 'AMI', 'Surface albedo']",,"This study compares two resampling methods, the k-dimensional tree (kd-tree) and the Python interface for Terra Advanced Fusion Resample/Reprojection functions (PyTAF), using surface albedo data from the GEO-KOMSAT-2A (GK2A) Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) geostationary satellite, with and without consideration of Earth’s curvature. Evaluation metrics include Correlation Coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Relative RMSD (RRMSD), Bias, spatial distribution, and processing time. Additional quantitative analyses were performed based on viewing zenith angle (VZA) intervals, ranging from 0° to 80° at 20° increments. The results showed that both resampling methods exhibited similar performance in terms of quantitative metrics, but differences emerged in processing time and VZA-specific analysis. These differences were primarily attributed to variations in algorithm design. Specifically, as VZA increased, the panoramic effect caused each pixel to cover a larger geographic area, resulting in geometric distortions. Additionally, the influence of reflectance variability between snow-covered and non-snow-covered regions further exacerbated data uncertainty and geometric distortions. These combined factors contributed to reduced accuracy and increased errors during resampling, leading to higher RMSD and RRMSD values. This study provides empirical evidence of the performance differences between the two resampling methods, offering practical insights for selecting the optimal resampling technique based on research objectives and data conditions."

This paper first examines the introduction of Korean picturebooks into Brazil, analyzing the texts and illustrations of Korean works included in Brazil’s federal reading programs and published in the Brazilian market, based on Maria Nikolajeva’s conceptions. The initial works introduced to the Brazilian market can be classified as illustrated books, with genuine picturebooks having their starting point with Suzy Lee’s “Wave”(2008). A study of the characteristics and genres of Korean children’s literature published in Brazil from this period until 2015 shows that these works engage child readers and serve as a link to Korean culture and lifestyle through their diverse formats and content. Thus, picturebooks play a crucial role as a part of Korean cultural products, well representing K–style, i.e., Hallyu 4.0. The paper then examines the recent trends and characteristics of Korean picturebooks published in Brazil since 2017. Recently, specialized agencies have begun to select Korean picturebooks and present them to Brazilian publishers. Additionally, the relevance of other Hallyu products, like K–dramas, and the themes of Korean children’s literature that resonate with international audiences, particularly feminism, have been gaining attention. Currently, works by Korean authors such as Suzy Lee, Heena Baek, Lee Geum–yi, Ryu Jae–soo, JiHyeon Lee, and Jo Ara have been consistently published in Brazil, functioning as part of Hallyu 4.0 and showcasing K–style for over 15 years."

In this paper, we present a fire detection system based on a K-NN classification model using a multi-sensor based fire detector. Also, by constructing a mesh network for fire detection, detectors within a spatial range can be interlinked to detect fire. Looking at the performance evaluation results of the implemented system, it was confirmed that the TPR(True Positive Rate) of fire classification was 96.1%, the FPR(False Positive Rate) was 0%, and the F1-Score, which corresponds to the harmonized mean value of accuracy and reproduction rate of fire and non-fire classification, was 98.01%, and the prediction accuracy ACC(Accuracy) showed excellent performance of 98.05%. In the future, we intend to develop it into an intelligent fire detector system through mesh network monitoring and multi-sensor self-diagnosis functions."

The investigation was conducted in two stages. First, IP-final tones in the dataset were categorized according to the K-ToBI convention (Jun, 2000). While significant relationships were observed between the meaning of ani and its IP-final tones, substantial overlap between groups was notable. Second, the F0 characteristics of the final syllable of ani were analyzed to elucidate the apparent many-to-many relationships between intonation and meaning/speech level. Results indicated that these seemingly overlapping relationships could be significantly distinguished. Overall, this study advocates for a deeper analysis of phonetic intonation beyond ToBI-based categorical labels. By examining the F0 characteristics of the IP-final syllable, previously unclear connections between meaning/speech level and intonation become more comprehensible. Although ToBI remains a valuable tool and framework for studying intonation, it is imperative to explore beyond these categories to grasp the “distinctiveness” of intonation, thereby enriching our understanding of prosody."

Emphasizing prevention, public awareness, and early detection, along with the role of dysphagia rehabilitation experts and community collaboration, is essential for supporting healthy aging."
Proof-Theoretic Justification for Deduction and the Fundamental Assumption,2024,"['Proof-Theoretic Semantics', 'Validity', 'Fundamental Assumption', 'Dummett', '증명론적 의미론', '타당성', '근본가정', '덤밋']",,"Proof-theoretic semantics is a semantic framework that explains the meaning of sentences through the notion of proof. In proof-theoretic semantics, the validity of an argument is defined in such a way that, if the premises can be correctly asserted, then the conclusion can also be correctly asserted. This paper examines Dummett's definition of validity and elucidates its meaning by exploring the relationship between validity and the fundamental assumption. In addition, I clarify the relationship between the fundamental assumption and the thesis that self-justifying introduction rules fix the meaning of logical constants. In particular, by refuting Kürbis's criticism, I reaffirm the necessity of the fundamental assumption for the proof-theoretic definition of validity in formal language. On this basis, I claim that the fundamental assumption is a fundamental assumption."

Movies about yeolnyeo kept being produced until the 1980s but more or less disappeared afterwards. Recently, however, several K-dramas such as Yeolnyeo Bakssi Gyeyak Gyeolhondyeon (Yeolneyo Park’s Contract Marriage) and Bame Pineun Kkot (Night Flower) have dealt with the yeolnyeo motif. Among them, Yeolnyeo Bakssi Gyeyak Gyeolhondyeon is based on a web novel of the same title which was published in 2020. The author mentioned that she got the idea for her novel from Yeolnyeo Hamyang Bakssijeon, an eighteenth century story about a yeolnyeo who killed herself after her husband’s death. This paper analyzes how yeolnyeo narrative is appropriated in today’s Korean web novels and dramas. It examines how these contents treat the critical viewpoint on yeolnyeo ideology as a fait accompli while using the yeolnyeo motif as a means to give an impetus to the story’s development and to increase and maintain the dramatic tension of the story."

The research questions were as follows: 1) What are the differences in the perceived importance and implementation of AI convergence education competencies among teachers according to the TPACK level? 2) What training needs are for AI convergence education competencies according to the teacher’s TPACK level? A survey was conducted with 615 K-12 teachers. K-means cluster analysis, paired samples t-test, Borich needs ranking, and locus for focus analysis were performed to identify AI convergence education competency training requirements according to TPACK level. The results are as follows. First, K-12 teachers with lower TPACK levels perceived the importance of AI convergence education competencies as high but the level of implementation as low. Second, teachers with higher TPACK levels showed greater training needs for developing AI convergence lesson materials and evaluating AI convergence lesson media. In contrast, teachers with lower TPACK levels showed higher training needs for exploring and selecting AI tools for classroom use and providing learner feedback. These findings underscore the significance of considering both teachers’ perceived TPACK levels and required AI convergence education competencies to enhance the overall quality of AI convergence education."

Traveling televisual texts: transnational adaptations of “Doctor Foster” into Korea’s “The World of the Married” and the Philippines’ “The Broken Marriage Vow”,2024,"['The World of the Married', 'Koreanovela', 'transnational adaptation', 'The Broken Marriage Vow']",,"Korean dramas, commonly referred to as Koreanovelas or K-Dramas in the Philippines, have significantly influenced and reshaped Philippine television culture since the early 2000s. Their impact persists in contemporary television programming, reflecting the transnational flow of media texts across borders. As media content transcends geographical boundaries, local media companies have adopted the practice of producing adaptations of foreign television series for their audiences. This paper examines the adaptation of the Koreanovela The World of the Married into the Philippine series The Broken Marriage Vow, both of which are adaptations derived from the British show Doctor Foster. Through this comparative analysis, I argue that the process of localizing these television shows to suit the preferences of the target audience serves as a tangible manifestation of transnational adaptation. Particularly in an era of globalization, where entertainment is still a thriving enterprise, thus traversing international borders, this phenomenon demonstrates the evolving nature of television content as it adapts and caters to diverse cultural contexts let alone a profitable means to generate an ailing entertainment industry, especially in the time of the pandemic."

Several prominent cities, including Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, etc., are significantly contributing to the Indian economy. Considering the importance of the state, a deterministic seismic hazard analysis is executed to reduce the damages to critical and important structures and fatalities caused due to earthquakes. Past earthquakes data are collected within and around the state to prepare a homogenised earthquake catalogue. Seven seismic zones are prepared using K- mean cluster analysis. Independent earthquake events i.e., mainshocks are identified using four renowned declustering methods. Additionally, with the help of mainshocks from each zone, the maximum observed earthquake magnitude () and positive correction factor (Δ) are estimated. By superimposing all the mainshocks (after adding Δ) onto the fault map, the maximum observed possible earthquake magnitude of all faults () are assigned to each fault. value is used to estimate surface rupture length (RLD) and consecutively, the maximum magnitude (MMax) from fault sources are estimated. Three region-specific ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) are adopted in the logic trees assigning a proper weightage to each GMPE. A seismic hazard contour maps are prepared at bedrock level, C, and D-type soil sites for Maharashtra. In the western part of the study area, the maximum PGA value is found to be 0.58 g, 0.70 g, and 0.33 g at bedrock level, C, and D-type sites, respectively."

In this study, we examined how regional dialects have been represented in Korean dramas produced since 2018 in terms of the everydayness of dialects and language attitudes. < Our Blues >, along with < Reply 1994 >, revealed the daily life and language culture of dialects by having many major characters use dialects. Meanwhile, differences in dialect use between generations also revealed the crisis of extinction of dialects. In < When the Camellia Blooms > and < Top Star Yubaek >, dialects were actively used in romantic narratives, suggesting that the use of dialects in dramas could be expanded. In < Our Blues >, the character's inherent orientation is connected to the linguistic attitude toward the use of dialect, and in < Youth in May >, the attitude that regarded the standard language as superior in the 1980s is revealed."

Among them, 14 participants were assigned to the experimental group and 18 to the control group, who attended a senior day care center in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. The experimental group received 12 sessions of art therapy with MBCT, with sessions lasting 60 minutes and taking place once a week for 12 weeks. To assess the program's effects, K-MMSE, K-GDS, and EMIL scale were administered before and after the program. The data was analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test in SPSS 25.0. Additionally, the behavioral characteristics of the experimental group participants were observed and recorded throughout the program. The results of this study are as follows: First, the cognitive function of the experimental group significantly improved after participating in the art therapy program using MBCT. Second, there were no significant results in depression and meaning of life in the experimental group. Third, when examining the behavioral characteristics of the participants with early stage dementia who participated in the program, it was found that art therapy using MBCT led to a reduction in depression and a positive enhancement in the meaning of life. Based on these research findings, it can be concluded that art therapy using MBCT is effective in improving cognitive function in older adults with early stage dementia and may contribute to reducing depression and enhancing the meaning of life. The significance of this study is that it developed and proposed a program for elderly people with early stage of dementia to visualize and easily access MBCT by combining it with art therapy, and suggested the possibility of non-pharmacological treatment for psychological support of elderly people with early dementia."

On the other hand, there is still a lack of data on the ENHYPEN related to storytelling such as Webtoon in the same agency. They applied the worldview webtoon to reality, such as collaboration with Lotte World and collaboration with Spao. Despite the fact that the world view that existed only as content has been actively expanded in many ways, none of the papers that have studied the ENHYPEN have studied storytelling in detail through image analysis. Therefore, this study examined how their world view and storytelling were set up and how they were developed through the analysis of two debut trailer videos of the ENHYPEN focusing on the concept of webtoons and debut album.

Specifically, it investigates the music appreciation of Yun Yi-hu and those around him, distinguishing between professional musicians, household servants, and other affiliated performers, including kisaeng(female entertainer) and kwangdae(male entertainer).Yun Yi-hu, a grandson of Yun Sŏn-do and the father of Yun Du-sŏ, did not personally engage in musical performances. However, he composed Ilminga and frequently enjoyed listening to music played by skilled servants. His acquaintances, including Yi Hyŏng-jing and Song Ch’ang-jwa, were literati who played the kŏmun'go at Yun’s request and often performed alongside his servants.Most of the music-related entries in Chiam ilgi focused on musically talented servants. Female servants who could sing or play instruments were recorded as kabi(歌婢, singing maidservants), kŭmbi(琴婢, zither maidservants), and yabi(倻婢). Male servants who were skilled in wind instruments were commonly referred to as chŏkno(笛奴) or chŏkdong(笛童, flute male servants). The Chiam ilgi reveals that musical servants affiliated with a household learned instruments and singing from either professional musicians or fellow servants. When necessary, they even stayed at other households for extended periods to receive training. Additionally, well-trained servants gained a reputation through word of mouth, and others would occasionally request their services from the master.In Chiam ilgi, the term kŭma(琴兒) often appears to refer to a kisaeng skilled in playing the kŏmun'go. It describes scenes where kisaengs who played the kŏmun'go were present, with literati bringing them to gatherings to enjoy music together. Chiam iIlgi also includes records related to entertainers, shamans, and others, providing a glimpse into the musical culture of the Haenam region in the late 17th century.In the late Chosŏn period, literati often played musical instruments with an emphasis on self-cultivation(修身). However, Chiam ilgi reveals that Yun Yi-hu and his peers used music as a means of immediate enjoyment. The diary depicts literati playing instruments and singing with servant musicians, freely rising to dance and enjoy themselves when they were in high spirits, without regard for others. This shows their desire, at least momentarily, to escape the realistic limitations they faced as members of the Namin(南人) political faction."
Determination of the Genetic Landscape and Hybridization Structure of Zoysia Species in Korea Using AFLP Markers,2024,"['AFLP analysis', 'analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA)', 'Genetic diversity', 'Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA)', 'Zoysia species']",,"In this study, we focused on the genetic variation, structure, and hybridization patterns of different species of Zoysia grass found in the biogeographic regions of coastal South Korea. In total, we collected 170 samples from five Zoysia species (Zoysia japonica, Zoysia macrostachya, Zoysia sinica, Zoysia matrella, and Zoysia koreana) at five different locations. As outgroups for analysis, we obtained specimens of Zoysia tenuifolia collected abroad and Cynodon dactylon collected in Korea. Genetic variation among these samples was evaluated by performing amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker analysis to confirm morphological identity, analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA), k-means clustering, and hybrid classification using a NewHybrids software. The AMOVA revealed that most of the genetic variations can be found among populations within localized areas, inferring that there is a high level of local diversity. On the basis of the selected hybridization model, Zoysia koreana was also found to show a high level of genetic diversity and hybrid characteristics, which be attributed to hybridization among Z. japonica, Z. sinica, or Z. matrella. Furthermore, application of the fixation index among populations using the permutation test (PhiPT) values and clustering analysis revealed significant species-specific genetic differentiation at the population level, as opposed to the regional level. A high genetic affinity between Z. koreana and other species would tend to indicate that this species serves as a genetic bridge for genetic transfer among the Zoysia species. Our findings in this study highlight the wide range of genetic diversity among Zoysia populations in Korea, indicating the role of hybridization in connecting genetically distant species within the Zoysia genus. These findings serve to emphasize the considerable genetic diversity within populations, a knowledge of which will contribute to enhancing efforts to conserve genetic resources in Korean coastal grasslands. Further studies on Zoysia evolution should include extensive genetic and geographical investigations to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying evolutionary processes."

We also examined the correlation of K-VABS-II adaptive profiles with developmental and behavioral assessments.Methods Two hundred preschool children (73 females and 127 males, mean age 54.7±9.1 months) were recruited from special educational centers, community-based daycare centers, and kindergartens. Eighty-one with DD comprising 61 with autism spectrum disorder, 63 with intellectual disability, 12 with language disorder, and 119 with TD were included. Their developmental profiles were measured by the Psychoeducational Profile-Revised (PEP-R), Preschool Receptive-Expressive Language Scale (PRES), K-VABS-II, Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the Korean version of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (K-CARS). The parent completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC).Results The K-VABS-II Adaptive Behavior Composite and all domain scores of K-VABS-II differed significantly between children with DD and TD (all p<0.001). In most domains, K-VABS-II had moderate-to-strong correlations with PEP-R, PRES, K-CARS, and SRS.

This article looked into how the state power and the capital oppressed labor movement and how was worker’s status under the cold war system through these three examples of labor disputes.Management of the Joseon Electric Company was opposed to union organizing in the labor dispute and moreover began breaking the union in various means. As the strike with power outage impended, president Syngman Rhee intervened aggressively in the strike. The police exercised mighty force on behalf of the state power in the dispute of Joseon Spinning and Weaving Company. Syngman Rhee announced a warning statement when the dispute of Joseon Spinning and Weaving Company expanded into strike, and the dispute came to an end with giving rise to numbers of workers’ sacrifice because of his statement’s influence on that.The management ignored the regulations of the Labor Relations Act and responded by ‘stalling negotiations tactics’ during coal miner’s strike.

A novel index of surgical outcome, “neck function,” which comprises neck pain and cervical spine function according to the Japanese Orthopedic Association Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire, was proposed. We treated surgical outcomes as longitudinal rather than cross-sectional data and used KML for analysis. Patients were categorized as having good or poor outcomes based on the KML graph of neck pain and cervical spine function.Results: From 2016 to 2020, 104 patients underwent laminoplasty for DCM; however, 35 patients were excluded because of loss to follow-up or incomplete data. The authors found that central canal stenosis (odds ratio [OR], 17.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26254.73; p = 0.03) and preoperative neck pain (OR per 1 point increase = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.12–1.99; p = 0.006) were 2 negative predictive factors and that a positive K-line during f lexion was a positive predictive factor (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01–0.87; p = 0.036) for neck function after laminoplasty.Conclusion: Central canal stenosis, preoperative neck pain and a K-line during flexion were found to be predictive of postoperative neck pain and cervical spine function after laminoplasty. To achieve better surgical outcomes for neck function, the authors suggest the utilization of these determinants as a guiding framework for the selection of surgical approaches for DCM."

First of all, RGB image data of chestnuts treated using 51 two-knife peeling process conditions were acquired. The developed model was constructed with two stages of K-means clustering and ranking systems. The Jaccard similarity index for a performance evaluation of the models was calculated. The first clustering stage was a process of separating the chestnut and background from the original image. The average Jaccard similarity index of the first clustering step was 0.92. The second clustering step was the division process of the peeled chestnut into three regions (outer shell, inner shell, and kernel). The percentage of each region was derived by dividing the number of pixels in each region by the total number of pixels in the image. The Jaccard similarity indices of the outer shell, inner shell, and kernel were 0.96, 0.88, and 0.74, respectively. As a result, machine learning-based clustering with a ranking system was proposed to analyze whether the peeling rate affects the improvement of the peel efficiency and production efficiency in the domestic chestnut industry."

Phase Equilibria of Binary Mixtures of 3-Chloro-2-Hydroxypropyl Methacrylate and 2-N-Morpholinoethyl Methacrylate in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide,2024,['Monomer · Carbon dioxide · Solubility · Phase transition behavior · Peng–Robinson equation of state'],,"This study presents exceptional perception into the phase transition behavior of binary mixtures containing 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate (3C2HM) or 2-N-morpholinoethyl methacrylate (2NMEM) in supercritical CO 2 at diff erent operating temperatures (313.2–393.2 K) and pressures (3.36–33.90 MPa). The fi ndings are expected to signifi cantly contribute to the evolution of advanced materials and technologies in several industrial sectors. As temperature increases at constant pressure, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) solubility in the monomer aqueous phase decreases. However, the solvability of the binary systems improved with temperature and mole fraction at steady pressure. The 2NMEM component exhibited higher polarizability and lower surface tension than the 3C2HM monomer, making it less soluble in CO 2 , which is a nonpolar compound.The solution phase of the binary systems exhibited Type I phase behavior, and the phase diagrams were nearly identical. The experimental solubility data were adequately correlated with the Peng–Robinson equation of state with the aid of molecular interaction parameters (IPs) which was evaluated at 353.2 K. The optimized molecular IPs were nearly zero, confi rming that both binary systems were nearly ideal mixture systems as the temperature increased. The model precision was evaluated by calculating the percentage of root-mean-square deviation (RSD%) at fi ve temperatures using the molecular IPs.The calculated RSD% of the CO 2 + 3C2HM and CO 2 + 2NMEM systems were 4.70% and 4.91%, respectively, indicating that the model values fi t reasonably well. Therefore, the predicted phase behavior agrees well with the experimental phase transitions of both systems. The characteristics of the critical solution curve were simulated to realise the interactions and transition behavior of the studied binary systems. This is the fi rst study to demonstrate the solubility of CO 2 + 3C2HM and CO 2 + 2NMEM chemical mixtures, and it will be signifi cant for chemical industries."

Thirteen children in the 4th to 6th grades with borderline intellectual function, 10 general children, and 45 parents of borderline intellectual functional children participated in this study. The individual factors were selected by the researcher, and the correlation between the selected language ability, empathy ability, self-esteem and social communication skills was examined, and the differences between borderline intellectually functioning children and ordinary children were compared. Finally, The factors affecting social communication skills were explored. The results of the study are as follows. First, as a result of examining the correlation between personal factors and social communication skills, cognitive empathy was significantly correlated with receptive language, expressive language, and meaning, which are sub-elements of language ability, and cognitive empathy was correlated with emotional empathy and social self-esteem. Second, in the difference in personal factors between children with borderline intellectual functioning and ordinary children, there was a significant difference between children with borderline intellectual functioning and ordinary children in areas other than emotional empathy and understanding of emotional emoticons. Third, in the search for factors affecting social communication skills, it was found that among parental parenting attitudes, autonomous parenting attitudes had an effect on social communication. Fourth, in the relationship between social communication ability and school adaptation, discourse management has a significant effect on academic attitude, and the higher the non-verbal communication, the higher the peer relationship. The above study results confirm that, although borderline intellectually functioning children are excluded from special education support, they are different from general children and have clear difficulties in everyday situations. It is expected that this study will help understand the characteristics of children with borderline intellectual function and develop support and programs accordingly."

It is true that Korea’s status has recently improved greatly compared to the past. In particular, K-drama, which became popular globally in 2021, can be said to be a good example of the so-called Korean Wave. In addition, Korea’s status in the K-Pop and sports fields has become incomparable to that of the 1980s and 90s. The easiest way for Americans to learn about this advanced Korea is through the Internet or media such as SNS and YouTube. Most people learned about Korea’s past through their own textbooks.Therefore, this study attempted to determine how American high school textbooks describe Korea. To this end, through interviews, we identified the aspects of Korea described in American high school textbooks. The characteristics of descriptions of Korea in American high school textbooks are as follows. First, there was a lot of technology mainly related to the Korean War. Second, when using the data, most of it was old data. Third, there were problems that occurred when the data was reduced and described because the amount was too small.To overcome this problem, it was first proposed to provide the latest photographic data in data use. This is because photos are materials that implicitly contain many meanings, and at the same time, they are the easiest way for current students to receive information. Second, the government's efforts are needed to ensure that accurate and correct information is delivered. To this end, the role of the Overseas Koreans Agency, which started in 2023, is more important than anything else."

Identifying Cluster Patterns in Relationship Between Municipal Revenue Configuration and Fiscal Surplus: Application of Machine Learning Methodologies,2024,"['Government Fiscal Surplus', 'Machine Learning Methodologies', 'Revenue Configuration', 'Cluster by Financial Sources']",,"Net surplus serves as a crucial indicator of how efficiently local governments utilize their resources. This study aims to analyze and categorize the patterns of net surplus across 75 local governments in Korea. By employing machine learning techniques such as K-means clustering and silhouette analysis, this research delves into surplus patterns, revealing insights that differ from those provided by traditional analytical methods. Machine learning enables a broader spectrum of discoveries, leading us to identify three distinct clusters in the net surplus of Korean local finances. The characteristics of these three clusters show that the wealthiest cities have the highest surplus ratios. In contrast, mid-sized municipalities, constrained by limited central government support and scarce local resources, exhibit the lowest surplus ratios. Interestingly, a significant number of cities maintain a median surplus ratio even under challenging fiscal conditions. Additionally, we identify critical thresholds that differentiate the three clusters: a grant-in-aid ratio of 19.31%, a debt ratio of 3.52%, and a local tax ratio of 25.58%. This identification of thresholds is a key contribution of our study, as these specific thresholds have not been previously addressed in the literature."

농촌공간정비사업 대상지 우선순위 평가방법,2024,"['Rural spatial planning', 'Selection of business target area', 'Basic statistical analysis', 'Cluster analysis', 'Pareto analysis']",,"This study aims to find an evaluation methodology for selecting target sites for efficient promotion of rural space development projects. It examines the status of livestock farms, residential buildings, factories, and solar power facilities across 229 towns and townships in Jeollanam-do and uses basic statistical analysis, K-means clustering, and Pareto analysis to categorize sites by harmfulness and density. The basic analysis method and the K-means clustering method are useful for analyzing and interpreting data, but each method has several drawbacks: achieving statistical significance and the difficulty of determining the number of clusters. In this study, Pareto analysis produces results similar to those of basic analysis because it also highlights the most significant factors affecting the overall outcome. Pareto analysis specifically focuses on identifying and visualizing the top contributors to a problem or situation, often using the 80/20 rule, which states that approximately 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. This can be particularly useful for prioritizing areas that need improvement. The methodology proposed in this study enables straightforward and objective planning and policy decision-making for future rural space improvement projects based on rural spatial planning."

Recently, various virtual idols such as PLAVE, MAVE, and NAEVIS have appeared on the Korean K-pop scene and have proceeded to exert significant influence over consumers. To examine the effects of this influence, we employed a qualitative approach due to the lack of existing literature on this topic. The interviewees totaled 6 people, and the results of the analysis based on positive psychology and form-behavioral realism are as follows: Consumer perceptions of the form-behavioral realism of each virtual idol were different. In addition, consumer well-being in terms of positive emotions, engagement, and relationship was present, but the dimensions of meaning and accomplishment were not. Moreover, through the behavioral realism of the virtual idols, we found that the positive emotions, engagement, and relationship- forming were also related. This research can help provide a new communication model in the digital era and help establish marketing strategies to improve consumer well-being."
Analysis of Intervertebral Fixation Systems in a Rat Caudal Model of Spinal Fusion,2024,"['Key Words: Rat caudal spine', 'Intervertebral fixation', 'Mechanical testing', 'Bending stiffness', 'Spinal fusion']",,"Study Design: Original research article.Objectives: This study compared the stiffness of established and novel fixation systems when applied to the caudal segment in Sprague-Dawley rats in an ex vivo trial.Study of Literature Review: Segmental hypermobility necessitates the application of model-specific intervertebral fixation.Materials and Methods: Six fixation systems (external k-wires, internal k-wire, titanium plate, polymer plate, polymer plate with spacer attachment [polymer T], and polymer plate with spacer attachment and ventral hook [polymer I]) were acquired or fabricated.These were compared to three control groups. Ninety-nine segments from coccygeal (Co) levels Co3 to Co8 were randomly allocated to the nine groups. Surgical implantation was timed, and segments were prepared and evaluated via micro-computed tomography imaging for inclusion. Four-point quasistatic bend testing was used to derive sample stiffness in ventral and lateral flexion.Results: In the ventral flexion position, external K-wires and polymer I fixation groups (mean ± standard deviation) displayed significantly greater bending stiffness of 9.11±7.55 N/mm2 and 9.66 ± 6.15 N/mm2 when compared to the control with no surgery (p=0.013 and 0.005), respectively. In the lateral flexion position, the polymer I group had significantly greater bending stiffness (3.32±1.57 N/mm2) than the nosurgery control (p=0.023).Conclusions: The novel polymer I fixation device showed superior segmental stiffness in ventral and lateral flexion compared to the control that did not undergo surgery, and other established external stabilisation devices. Further research should assess viability and methodology of internal fixation systems for in vivo implantation."

The participants were 311 mothers with elementary schoolchildren who lived in the Daegu-Gyeongbuk area. Data were collected through an online questionnaire provided on the portal site and analyzed using k-means clustering, t -test, One-Way ANOVA, and Pearson’s correlation using IBM SPSS Statistics 21 for Windows and, RMSEA, TLI, NFI and CFI using IBM SPSS AMOS 18 for Windows. The principal results were as follows. Firstly, mothers’ EPA anxiety and avoidance had a negative influence on social interest. Secondly, social interest was found to be significantly higher among mothers with a secure attachment style than among mothers with an insecure attachment style. Thirdly, significant differences were observed in levels of social interest among mothers with secure, preoccupied, dismissive, and disorientated attachment styles. A Scheffé post-hoc test revealed that social interest was significantly higher among mothers with a secure attachment style than among mothers with a disorientated attachment style. The experience of relationships with caregivers early in life is therefore important in the development of social interest."

A country comparison analysis showed that economic centers with high GRDP had lower voter turnout in both countries. K-means clustering identified three regional clusters, revealing a trend where regions with higher economic growth or economic hardship tended to have lower participation rates. In South Korea, multiple regression analysis indicated that the home sales index had the largest influence on turnout, while income and wealth had smaller effects. Economic expectations from the Consumer Sentiment Survey were insignificant. In Mexico, analyses of business activity and workforce percentages showed that closed businesses had a slight negative effect on turnout, but overall, economic variables did not significantly impact participation. This study provides key insights for companies operating in South Korea and Mexico, emphasizing the importance of aligning market entry strategies with regional socioeconomic and political dynamics. Businesses targeting economically prosperous areas must address potential political disengagement and policy unpredictability, while those in regions with moderate economic activity may benefit from stronger community engagement. Additionally, firms in economically challenged areas should prioritize CSR initiatives to address inequality and foster sustainable operations."

Methods To recruit two elderly women with cognitive impairment and two without, a total of four elderly women (age: 78.25±7.18) were selected based on the results of the K-MMSE test. The plantar pressure analyzer measured gait velocity (GV), cadence (CAD), stance time symmetry index (STSI), and gait velocity ratio (GVR), while the accelerometer measured the root mean square (RMS) of total acceleration vectors and gait lateral variability index (GLI). Results The results showed that GV, GVR, RMS, and GLI were lower in the group with cognitive impairment compared to the group without. However, CAD and STSI did not show significant differences between the two groups, nor did they provide reliable results within the cognitive impairment group. Elderly individuals with cognitive impairment exhibited reduced forward propulsion and gait stability compared to their non-impaired counterparts. Conclusion In gait analysis for cognitive function assessment, it is appropriate to utilize GV, GVR, RMS, and GLI."

The vehicle dynamics indexes are extracted through vehicle history trajectories and the driving styles are clustered by k-means methods. After that the perception coefficient, reaction coefficient, and driving style correction coefficient are obtained and integrated into the psychological field for characterizing the drivers’ driving styles. The psychological car-following model which considers the driving styles is built based on the Full Velocity Difference (FVD) model. Finally, the model is validated under the MATLAB/Simulink environment and the result reveals that the psychological field car-following model achieves higher accuracy of characterizing car-following behavior compared with the FVD model and the interaction potential model."

To achieve this, the optimal number of clusters was determined by comparing spectral clustering and k-means clustering. These results are guaranteed by calculating the Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI), a model performance index. The DBI values were 0.734 for spectral clustering and 1.715 for k-means clustering, indicating lower values showed better performance. Thus, the superiority of spectral clustering was confirmed. Furthermore, T-test and ANOVA were used to reveal statistically significant differences between ESG non-financial data, and correlation coefficients were used to confirm the relationships between ESG indicators. Based on these results, this study suggests the possibility of estimating the ESG performance ranking of each public institution without existing ESG ratings. This is achieved by calculating the optimal number of clusters, and then determining the sum of averages of the ESG data within each cluster. Therefore, the proposed model can be employed to evaluate the ESG ratings of various domestic public institutions, and it is expected to be useful in domestic sustainable management practice and performance management."

The patients were divided into RIRS and PCNL groups by the surgical method. The participants completed the K-WISQOL within four weeks before and after treatment. The patients’ baseline characteristics, surgical outcomes, and K-WISQOL scores were compared according to the presence of RF in each surgical group.Results: Of the 156 patients, 95 underwent RIRS, and 61 underwent PCNL. In the RIRS group, the patients’ baseline characteristics and surgical outcomes were similar in the stone-free (SF) and RF subgroups. The changes in all K-WISQOL domain scores and total scores were similar in the two subgroups. In the PCNL group, the RF subgroup had a significantly higher proportion of staghorn stones, a significantly larger mean stone diameter and significantly longer operation time than those of the SF subgroup. But, the changes in all K-WISQOL domain scores and total scores were not significantly different between the two subgroups, as observed in the RIRS group.Conclusions: This study showed that the presence of RFs after endoscopic kidney surgery did not affect the short-term patient-reported QOL regardless of the surgical methods."

Medical records of 177 patients were retrospectively reviewed. PSF was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)-9.Patients were classified into two groups: a PSF group (mean FSS ≥ 4) and a non-PSF group (mean FSS < 4). Stroke severity was measured with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and functional outcomes were evaluated using Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), Berg Balance Test, Korean version of the Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI), and Mini-Mental State Examination-Korean version (MMSE-K). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.The prevalence of PSF was 52.5%. The repeated measures of analysis of variance showed significant “time” effects on FAC (F = 29.726, p < 0.001) and K-MBI (F = 15.348, p < 0.001).A significant “group” effect was observed on MMSE-K (F = 4.571, p = 0.035), and a “time × group” interaction on only K-MBI (F = 4.284, p = 0.041). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that improvements in K-MBI scores were independent of initial severity, depression, and age (p = 0.043). PSF affects the recovery of activities of daily living (ADL) in stroke patients, suggesting that regulating early fatigue after stroke positively affects functional recovery."

B. 포스터, K. 사이토 등)에 따르면 마르크스는 자본주의 기술의 진보와 생산력을 무비판적으로 찬양했다는 기존의 해석과는 달리, 자연과 환경 악화의 문제를 체계적으로 연구하고 발전시켰으며, 생태적 지속가능성의 문제를 제기한 탁월한 사상가이다. 그는 당시에 오늘날처럼 심각한 생태 위기의 현상을 목격하지 못했지만, 자연 자원의 고갈과 생태계에 가해지는 과부하 등의 생태 문제를 염려하고 그 해결책으로 자본주의 생산양식을 비판하며 새로운 사회체제를 제시하였다. 특히 그의 초기에 전개된 인간과 자연의 변증법과 후기의 물질대사론을 통해 마르크스는 자본주의의 모순이 인간과 자연 사이의 물질대사 과정에 균열을 가져온다고 주장하면서, 양자의 균열을 극복하고 물질대사의 합리적 조절과 관리를 위해 자본주의에서 사회주의로의 이행을 촉구한다. 따라서 자본주의의 모순인 생태 위기를 극복하기 위해서는 생산수단의 국유화에 의한 사회주의 실현이라는 마르크스의 ‘역사적 유물론’의 관점보다 후기 저서에서 본격적 적용된 ‘물질대사’의 관점이 더 중요하며, 이를 통해 인간과 자연의 온전한 물질대사 회복과 도시-농촌 대립의 극복이 가능하다. 이러한 맥락에서 자본주의의 주요 모순 중 하나임에도 불구하고 그동안 연구에서 등한시되었던 물질대사 균열과 그 극복의 논의로서 마르크스의 생태론은 오늘날 생태 위기를 극복하는 데 중요한 통찰력을 제공한다.","The purpose of this study is to focus on the ecological aspect of Marx's thought, which has been neglected, and to positively evaluate the ecological implications of his view of nature and metabolism, and to see what meaning and insight Marx's ecology provides in today's era of ecological crisis. According to recent research results (J. B. Forster, K. Saito, etc.), contrary to the existing interpretation that Marx uncritically praised the progress and productive power of capitalist technology, he systematically studied and developed the problems of nature and environmental degradation. He is an outstanding thinker who raised the issue of ecological sustainability. At the time, he did not witness the serious ecological crisis as it is today, but he was concerned about ecological problems such as depletion of natural resources and overload on the ecosystem, and he criticized the capitalist mode of production as a solution and proposed a new social system. In particular, through the dialectics between humans and nature developed in his early days and the theory of metabolism in his later years, Marx argues that the contradictions of capitalism bring about a rift in the metabolic process between humans and nature. He urges a transition from capitalism to socialism in order to overcome the rift between the two and to rationally control and manage metabolism. Therefore, in order to overcome the ecological crisis, which is the contradiction of capitalism, the perspective of ‘metabolism’, which was applied in earnest in his later works, is more important than the perspective of Marx’s ‘historical materialism’, which is the realization of socialism through nationalization of the means of production. Through this, it is possible to restore the intact metabolism between humans and nature and to overcome the conflict between urban and rural areas. In this context, Marx's ecology as a discussion of metabolic rift and its overcoming, which has been neglected in research despite being one of the major contradictions of capitalism, provides important insight into overcoming today's ecological crisis."

Based on the findings of this study, the following points will be discussed. First, when applying narrative therapy to adolescent sui- cide survivors who are experiencing trauma symptoms or need to grieve, it is important to establish a rapport with the client to build a safe base. Second, by externalising realistic symptoms such as emo- tional distress, sleep disturbances, anxiety, or hearing voices, which are experienced by adolescent suicide survivors, through the use of ‘cutters’, it is possible to identify and expand the niche of alternative narratives. Third, a narrative therapy approach can help traumatised adolescent clients move away from a problem-focused narrative to an alternative narrative, opening up the possibility of expanding into the realm of identity based on future pathways and values. Fourth, Definitional Ceremony in youth trauma counselling have been shown to be effective in a variety of ways. The process of Definitional Ceremony allows adolescent clients to visualise powerful ideals through metaphorical representations, fosters a sense of hospitality and community solidarity through shared emotions, facilitates the ex- pansion of alternative narratives, and enriches identity narratives through the process of restatement. The opportunity to discover these new meanings and thoughts provided opportunities for mutual growth for the participating external witnesses and the adolescent client, and the process of telling and retelling in the Definitional Ceremony ex- panded and reframed the adolescent client's identity narratives. Therefore, this case study demonstrates the applicability of narrative therapy interventions with traumatised adolescent suicide survivors to expand alternative narratives by externalising their psychological dis- tress, and provides a practical approach for clinicians to use when working with similar cases of adolescent suicide survivors. The find- ings of this study suggest that in trauma counselling, staying in the past is trauma, staying in the present is identity, and moving into the future is a message of success for the community."
"Regional flood frequency analysis of extreme rainfall in Thailand, based on L-moments",2024,"['cluster analysis', 'generalized normal distribution', 'homogeneous region', 'quantile estimation', 'regional goodness-of-fit test', 'water management']",,"In this study, flood records from 79 sites across Thailand were analyzed to estimate flood indices using the regional frequency analysis based on the L-moments method. Observation sites were grouped into homogeneous regions using k-means and Ward’s clustering techniques. Among various distributions evaluated, the generalized extreme value distribution emerged as the most appropriate for certain regions. Regional growth curves were subsequently established for each delineated region. Furthermore, 20- and 100-year return values were derived to illustrate the recurrence intervals of maximum rainfall across Thailand. The predicted return values tend to increase at each site, which is associated with growth curves that could describe an increasing long-term predictive pattern. The findings of this study hold significant implications for water management strategies and the design of flood mitigation structures in the country."

The Buddha’s counseling from which she reconciled herself to the grief for the death of her little son is analyzed and discussed. And then, comparison between the Buddha’s counseling and the five stages of grief model suggested by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross is examined. The Buddha immediately didn’t preach the inevitability of death to Kisāgotamī. Instead, he resorted to an expedient means and made her personally accept this situation of the loss of her little child by reflecting on her own death and the impermanence of all living beings as well. The case of Kisāgotamī could be useful resources as a guide for the sake of solving grief of parents who lose their children, and of undergoing a paradigm shift about the death and starting a new life."

Satellite data were collected overthree years, from January 2021 to December 2023, producing a total of 497 matchups. Differences between SLSTR skinSSTs and buoy temperature measurements showed a Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) of about 0.42 K and a meanbias of 0.24 K, which met the pre-launch requirements of the SLSTR satellite. The mean bias was 0.14 K during thedaytime and 0.29 K at nighttime, with a larger negative bias observed at nighttime. Seasonal variability was alsoobserved with negative and positive biases occurring during winter and summer, respectively. Regionally, the RMSD rangewas broader in the Yellow Sea and southern region than in the East Sea. In addition, factors such as distance from thecoast, wind speed, and spatial gradient of SST were found to influence variability. Satellite SST showed a positive biasduring the daytime and negative bias at nighttime under low wind speed conditions below 4 m s1, with larger overallbiases at nighttime. The difference in satellite SST tended to decrease as the distance from the coast increased, whereasthe RMSD increased as the spatial gradient of sea surface temperature increased. The findings of this study emphasize theneed for further research on the characteristics of satellite SST variability, because this preliminary study on the use ofSLSTR satellite SST in highly localized environments highlights the significant influence of various environmental factors."

해양스포츠 현장에서의 몰입(Flow) 탐색,2024,"['Flow', 'Skills', 'Challenges', 'Feelings', 'Three-Channels', '입', '기술', '도전', '감정', '3채널']","연구목적 이 연구는 Csikszentmihalyi의 몰입(Flow)이론을 근거로 하여 기존 이론을 발전시키고자 하였으며, 연구를 통해 변인들을 정량화하여 몰입을 수준별로 파악하고자 하였다. 변인 수준별로 군집을 구성하여몰입 수준의 채널을 확인하고, 변수 수준에 따른 몰입 수준을 기존 3채널 이론과 비교, 분석하고자 한다. 연구방법 이 연구의 전체 표본수는 스쿠버다이빙 392명, 서핑 421명으로 총 813명이다. 자료처리방법으로SPSS 27.0 version을 활용하여 빈도분석과 기술통계 분석, 신뢰도분석, K-평균 군집분석, 일원배치분산분석을 실시하였다. 모든 통계치에 대한 유의수준은 5%로 설정하였다. 결과 첫째, 기술수준과 도전수준이높아질수록 몰입수준도 높아지는 양상을 보였다. 둘째, 기존 3채널 이론과 마찬가지로 기술수준과 도전수준이 일치하는 구간에서 높은 기술수준과 높은 도전수준 일치 구간일수록 몰입수준이 높은 것으로 나타났다. 하지만, 가장 높은 몰입수준 구간은 기존 3채널 이론과 일치하지 않았다. 결론 이 연구에서 해양스포츠 참가자들의 높은 몰입 수준은 기존의 몰입 3채널 이론의 몰입 분포와 다르게 나타났으나 기술과 도전이 균형을이루는 구간이 커질수록 몰입 수준은 커졌다. 몰입은 감정의 영역이기에 기술과 도전이라는 두 가지 요인만으로 설명하기에는 어려운 부분이 있다. 기존의 몰입(Flow)이론은 주로 보편적인 일상의 상황들을 기준으로연구되었기에, 이 연구에서와 같이 특정 종목별 연구를 통해 몰입과 감정을 다양한 채널을 통하여 다차원적으로 확인할 필요가 있다. 향후 도전적인 스포츠를 비롯한 다양한 스포츠 종목의 종목별 특징이 충분히 고려된 연구가 이루어져야 할 것이며, 감정을 설명하기 위한 추가 변인을 통해 몰입과 몰입외 다른 감정들의채널 분포와 수준을 확인할 필요가 있다.","Purpose This study aims to develop the existing theory based on Csikszentmihalyi's Flow theory, and throughthe study, we tried to understand flow by level by quantifying variables. By organizing clusters by variable level, we want to check the channel of flow level and compare and analyze the level of flow according to the variablelevel with the existing three channels theories. Method The total number of samples in the Survey was 813, with392 scuba divers and 421 surfers. As a data processing method, frequency analysis, descriptive statisticsanalysis, reliability analysis, K-means cluster analysis, and one-way analysis of variance were conductedusing SPSS 27.0 version. The significance level for all statistics was set to 5%. Result First, we saw a trend ofhigher flow levels as the skill levels and challenge levels increased. Second, consistent with the traditionalthree-channels theory, higher skill and challenge levels are associated with higher levels of flow in the highskill and high challenge matching sectors. However, the highest level of flow was not consistent with thetraditional three-channels theory. Conclusion In this study, the high levels of flow among marine sportsparticipants differed from the flow distribution in traditional three-channels theory of flow, but higher levels ofbalanced skill and challenge were associated with higher flow. As flow is an feelings domain, it is difficult toexplain it with only two factors: skill and challenge. As the existing flow theories are mainly based on universaleveryday situations, in future study, it is necessary to expand flow and feelings to various channels in a multidimensional manner through study on specific sports as in this study. In the future, research on varioussports, including challenging sports, is needed, and the characteristics of each sport should be fullyconsidered. In the future, studies that fully consider the characteristics of various sports events, includingchallenging sports, should be conducted, and it is necessary to check the channel distribution and level ofFeelings other than flow and flow through additional variables to explain Feelings."

A three-dimensional light detectionand ranging (3D LiDAR) sensor was used to scan the greenhouse to extract point cloud data (PCD). Differential thresholds of the color index wereapplied to the partitions of raw PCD to separate steel frames from plastic films. Additionally, the K-means algorithm was used to convert the steelframe PCD into the nodes of unit members. These nodes were subsequently transformed into structural shape data. To verify greenhouse shapereproducibility, the member lengths of the scan and blueprint models were compared with the measurements along the X-, Y-, and Z-axes. The errorof the scan model was accurate at 2%-3%, whereas the error of the blueprint model was 5.4%. At a maximum snow depth of 0.5 m, the scan modelrevealed asymmetric horizontal deflection and extreme bending stress, which indicated that even minor shape irregularities could result in critical failuresin extreme weather. The safety factor for bending stress in the scan model was 18.7% lower than that in the blueprint model. This phenomenonindicated that precise shape estimation is crucial for safety diagnostic. Future studies should focus on the development of an automated process basedon supervised learning to ensure the widespread adoption of greenhouse safety diagnostics."
Nonparametric logistic regression based on sparse triangulation over a compact domain,2024,"['barycentric coordinates', 'coordinate descent algorithm', 'logistic regression', 'RDP algorithm', 'triangulation']",,"Based on the investigation of logistic regression models utilizing sparse triangulation within a compact domain in R², this study addresses the limited research extending the triogram model to logistic regression. A primary challenge arises from the potential instability induced by a large number of vertices, hindering the effective modeling of complex relationships. To mitigate this challenge, we propose introducing sparsity to boundary vertices of the triangulation based on the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm and employing the K-means algorithm for adaptive vertex initialization. A second order coordinate-wise descent algorithm is adopted to implement the proposed method. Validation of the proposed algorithm’s stability and performance assessment are conducted using synthetic and handwritten digit data (LeCun et al., 1989). Results demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing methodologies, particularly when dealing with non-rectangular data domains."

A total of 76 9th-grade students (35 males, 41 females) participated, and their activity levels were tracked in 2022 and 2023 using Actigraph’s 3D accelerometer (GT3X model). The data was analyzed using K-means cluster analysis and repeated measures ANOVA in SPSS 25.0. The key findings were as follows. First, as a result of comparing according to sex, sedentary activity significantly increased when students moved to high school, while light activity and MVPA decreased in both males and females. Second, in the case of the high MVPA group, among those who had higher baseline MVPA levels, the shift to high school was marked by a significant rise in sedentary time and a corresponding decrease in both light activity and MVPA. These results suggest that the high school environment negatively impacts physical activity levels in both sexes, with the effect being particularly pronounced in students who were more physically active during middle school. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop interventions and strategies to encourage physical activity throughout the high school years."

Using Wards, a hierarchical cluster analysis, the structure of the clusters was identified through a dendrogram, and using K-means cluster analysis, the failed companies were grouped into four clusters and the successful companies into five clusters. The four clusters of failed companies were characterised by, first, ‘lack of marketability verification and sales channels’, and second, ‘lack of patent and technology protection for products’. The third cluster was labelled ‘those who were in an existing market but failed to create a new market,’ and the fourth cluster was labelled ‘those who were unable to create a working prototype of their product and thus were unable to compete. The successful companies were divided into five clusters, the first being ‘those who beat the competition through marketing efficiency’, the second being ‘market-friendly’. The third cluster is ‘those that created new markets where there was no competition,’ and the fourth is ‘those that won with technological competitiveness. The fifth group, the most successful, is called the Market Expert Group. The most important takeaway from this is that market-friendly companies based on thorough market validation had the opportunity to grow faster than technology-based companies. This should serve as a reminder to startup entrepreneurs of the importance of market validation, as well as to startup incubators and mentors. The findings can be used pragmatically in future policy formulation to help startups grow through a sophisticated market validation process."

Machine Learning-Based Transactions Anomaly Prediction for Enhanced IoT Blockchain Network Security and Performance,2024,"['Anomaly prediction', 'Blockchain', 'Clustering algorithms', 'Fraud detection', 'Internet of Things (IoT)', 'Legitimate transactions', 'Machine learning', 'Privacy', 'Security']",,"The integration of blockchain technology with the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has enabled secure and decentralised data exchange. However, security vulnerabilities and performance limitations remain significant challenges in IoT blockchain networks. This work proposes a novel approach that combines transaction representation and machine learning techniques to address these challenges. Various clustering techniques, including k-means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Hierarchical clustering, were employed to effectively group unlabelled transaction data based on their intrinsic characteristics. Anomaly transaction prediction models based on classifiers were then developed using the labelled data. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure were used to identify the minority class representing specious transactions or security threats. The classifiers were also evaluated on their performance using balanced and unbalanced data. Compared to unbalanced data, balanced data resulted in an overall average improvement of approximately 15.85% in accuracy, 88.76% in precision, 60% in recall, and 74.36% in F1-score. This demonstrates the effectiveness of each classifier as a robust classifier with consistently better predictive performance across various evaluation metrics. Moreover, the k-means and GMM clustering techniques outperformed other techniques in identifying security threats, underscoring the importance of appropriate feature selection and clustering methods. The findings have practical implications for reinforcing security and efficiency in real-world IoT blockchain networks, paving the way for future investigations and advancements."
Estimation of physical microhabitat suitability for Koreoleptoxis globus (Mollusca: Gastropoda) using probability distribution models,2024,"['current velocity', 'endangered candidate species', 'Koreoleptoxis globus', 'probability distribution models', 'streambed substrate', 'water depth']",,"Background: Koreoleptoxis globus is an endangered candidate species of snail in South Korean streams. This species primarily inhabits streams characterized by fast current velocities and coarse-particle streambed substrates. In this study, 12 types of probability distribution models, including exponential, normal, log-normal, logistic, Weibull, gamma, beta, and Gumbel, were used to quantitatively assess the physical microhabitat preferences of K. globus. The evaluation was based on data collected from 340 sampling units across 34 sites in South Korea between April 2024 and May 2024, focusing on variables such as water depth, current velocity, and streambed substrate.Results: The best-fitting probability distribution models for each physical environmental factor were identified as follows: 1) water depth, inverted log-normal distribution, 2) current velocity, beta distribution, and 3) streambed substrate, Weibull distribution. Optimal water depth preferences ranged from 31.2 cm to 53.7 cm. Current velocity preferences ranged from 57.8 cm s-1 to 88.8 cm s-1. Substrate preferences ranged from −7.4 Φm to −5.6 Φm. The mean values for these factors were water depth of 35.8 cm, current velocity of 63.0 cm s-1, and streambed substrate of −5.7 Φm. Mode values were water depth of 44.4 cm, current velocity of 75.6 cm s-1, and substrate of −6.7 Φm. Standard deviation values were water depth of 15.8 cm, current velocity of 21.4 cm s-1, and streambed substrate of 1.5 Φm.Conclusions: Overall, the beta and Weibull distribution models demonstrated a high degree of fit, likely owing to the inherent flexibility of these models. Beta distribution models were well suited for cases with negative skewness, whereas Weibull distribution models provided a better fit for cases with positive skewness. The physical habitat characteristics of K. globus were quantitatively demontrated to correspond to riffled areas. Further research is required to explore the interactions between physical environmental factors and the impact of habitat disturbance."

We use 65,351 genotyped animals after the imputation with various genotyping platforms to perform genomic prediction accuracy. A 5-fold cross-validation method using K-Means clustering was employed to estimate genomic prediction accuracy. The K-Means clustering method was utilized using 142,827 pedigree data associated with the 65,351 genotypes ultimately used in the genomic analysis. Genomic prediction accuracies based on BayesC with fixed Pi value of 0.99 were estimated with the results of carcass weight at 0.722, eye muscle area at 0.711, backfat thickness at 0.594, marbling score at 0.642, and calving interval at 0.626. Based on these results of high genomic prediction accuracy, it is suggested that blending the Estimated Breeding Values (EBV) derived from BLUP methods with the MBVs derived from SNP marker effects can produce an integrated genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) with high reliability for five economic traits in Hanwoo."

Particularly, mobile devices such as smartphones, characterized by their mobility and individuality, offer a more nuanced reflection of users’ lifestyles through their usage patterns. This study segmented smartphone-based TV show viewers according to their primary viewing time slots and compared demographic profiles and viewing behaviors across these segments. First, K-means clustering was conducted using broadcast viewing log data from smartphones in 2022 from a panel of 2,040 individuals. The analysis resulted in segmentation into four gorups - a NIGHT group mainly used during the night (21:00 to 03:00), a WORK group mainly used during the work time (09:00 to 18:00), a COMMUTE group mainly used during the commute time (07:00 to 08:00, 18:00 to 19:00), and finally, a HEAVY group that has an evenly large amount of viewers across all time periods. Logistic regression analysis revealed significant differences in demographic characteristics (gender, age, residence) and viewership metrics (total viewing frequency, average viewing duration) among these groups, as well as variations in viewing concentration (channel, genre preferences). This study extends the discourse on the temporality of broadcasting, traditionally centred on fixed TV sets, to mobile devices. It will provide practical insights for developing new audience metrics and informing advertising pricing structures."
An Improved Automated Spectral Clustering Algorithm,2024,"['Cosine Angle Classification Method', 'Cluster Number Evaluation Factor', 'Density-Sensitive Distance', 'Spectral Clustering', 'UCI']",,"In this paper, an improved automated spectral clustering (IASC) algorithm is proposed to address the limitations of the traditional spectral clustering (TSC) algorithm, particularly its inability to automatically determine the number of clusters. Firstly, a cluster number evaluation factor based on the optimal clustering principle is proposed. By iterating through different k values, the value corresponding to the largest evaluation factor was selected as the first-rank number of clusters. Secondly, the IASC algorithm adopts a density-sensitive distance to measure the similarity between the sample points. This rendered a high similarity to the data distributed in the same high-density area. Thirdly, to improve clustering accuracy, the IASC algorithm uses the cosine angle classification method instead of K-means to classify the eigenvectors. Six algorithms-K-means, fuzzy C-means, TSC, EIGENGAP, DBSCAN, and density peak-were compared with the proposed algorithm on six datasets. The results show that the IASC algorithm not only automatically determines the number of clusters but also obtains better clustering accuracy on both synthetic and UCI datasets."
Estimation of physical microhabitat suitability for Koreoleptoxis globus (Mollusca: Gastropoda) using probability distribution models,2024,"['current velocity', 'endangered candidate species', 'Koreoleptoxis globus', 'probability distribution models', 'streambed substrate', 'water depth']",,"Background: Koreoleptoxis globus is an endangered candidate species of snail in South Korean streams. This species primarily inhabits streams characterized by fast current velocities and coarse-particle streambed substrates. In this study, 12 types of probability distribution models, including exponential, normal, log-normal, logistic, Weibull, gamma, beta, and Gumbel, were used to quantitatively assess the physical microhabitat preferences of K. globus. The evaluation was based on data collected from 340 sampling units across 34 sites in South Korea between April 2024 and May 2024, focusing on variables such as water depth, current velocity, and streambed substrate. Results: The best-fitting probability distribution models for each physical environmental factor were identified as follows: 1) water depth, inverted log-normal distribution, 2) current velocity, beta distribution, and 3) streambed substrate, Weibull distribution. Optimal water depth preferences ranged from 31.2 cm to 53.7 cm. Current velocity preferences ranged from 57.8 cm s<sup>-1</sup> to 88.8 cm s<sup>-1</sup>. Substrate preferences ranged from -7.4 Φm to -5.6 Φm. The mean values for these factors were water depth of 35.8 cm, current velocity of 63.0 cm s<sup>-1</sup>, and streambed substrate of -5.7 Φm. Mode values were water depth of 44.4 cm, current velocity of 75.6 cm s<sup>-1</sup>, and substrate of -6.7 Φm. Standard deviation values were water depth of 15.8 cm, current velocity of 21.4 cm s<sup>-1</sup>, and streambed substrate of 1.5 Φm. Conclusions: Overall, the beta and Weibull distribution models demonstrated a high degree of fit, likely owing to the inherent flexibility of these models. Beta distribution models were well suited for cases with negative skewness, whereas Weibull distribution models provided a better fit for cases with positive skewness. The physical habitat characteristics of K. globus were quantitatively demontrated to correspond to riffled areas. Further research is required to explore the interactions between physical environmental factors and the impact of habitat disturbance."
Development and validation of machine learning models to predict prediabetes using dietary intake data in young adults in Korea: a cross-sectional study,2024,"['Prediabetic state', 'Machine learning', 'Diet surveys', 'Young adult']",,"Purpose: This study aimed to develop and compare machine learning models for predicting prediabetesin young adults in Korea using dietary intake data and to identify the most effective model.Methods: Data from the ninth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used,with 823 participants aged 19-35 years selected after excluding those with missing data. Logistic regression,k-nearest neighbors, and random forest models were applied to predict prediabetes, and theanalysis was conducted using the Orange 3.5 program. Five-fold cross-validation was performed to reduceperformance variability, and test data were used for final model validation. Results: In the dataset,14%-15% of participants were classified as having prediabetes. The random forest model showedthe highest performance in terms of classification accuracy, harmonic mean of precision and recall,and precision. Logistic regression had the highest performance regarding the model’s ability to distinguishbetween individuals with and without prediabetes. Age, thiamine intake, and water intakeemerged as the most important predictors. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the utility of usingdietary intake data to predict prediabetes in young adults. The random forest model provided the highestprediction accuracy, supporting early detection and intervention, which could help to reduce unnecessarytreatment. This highlights nurses’ important role in educating patients about lifestyle changesand implementing preventive care. Future studies should incorporate additional factors, such aspsychological and lifestyle variables, to improve the model's performance."
Identification of core drought-responsive genes for developing drought-tolerant rice varieties through meta-analysis of RNA-Seq data,2024,['RNA-Seq\xa0· WGCNA\xa0· Rice\xa0· Drought\xa0· Tolerance'],,"Rice production is signifcantly afected by drought at various developmental stages. The identifcation and shortlisting of candidate genes for developing drought-tolerant rice varieties are ongoing. To identify core drought-responsive genes, we compared the transcriptomic changes between ten drought-tolerant rice varieties. Through our meta-analysis of publicly available RNA-Seq datasets, we identifed 3080 core diferentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to drought stress. K-means clustering analysis showed that the expression of core DEGs can be grouped into two clusters with distinct expression dynamics under drought stress. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the functional distribution of 1282 genes in cluster 1 showing upregulation in all the tolerant lines was mainly related to the abiotic stress response. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis of all the genes in cluster 1 revealed that among the 11 co-expressed modules, 2 the blue module showed signifcant positive correlation (195 genes; R = 0.73, P = 3.0 × 10 –19 ) with drought stress, which assisted us to narrow down the genes to identify candidates for drought stress tolerance. Through a literature search to identify functionally characterized genes, six drought tolerance-related candidate genes were detected, including LEA4-5 (LOC_Os08g23870), LEA14 (LOC_Os01g12580), OsRab16A (LOC_Os11g26790), OsADF3 (LOC_Os03g60580), OsPP108 (LOC_Os09g15670) and GBF3 (LOC_Os01g46970). Finally, we constructed a protein–protein interaction network and selected the hub genes in the blue module, two of which overlapped with candidates and may play a critical role in drought tolerance. Our results provide promising candidate genes that may be useful in transgenic studies or molecular marker-assisted selection for improving drought tolerance and increasing rice yields."

These clustering characteristics highlight that the distribution of foreign immigrants is influenced not only by their nationality and purpose of stay but also by the economic opportunities and social conditions of each region. This study explores the spatial distribution of foreign immigrants through county and district-level analyses, emphasizing the importance of employing more granular spatial units and time-series approaches in future research to achieve a deeper understanding of their residential patterns and economic activities."
식도암 수술 환자의 우울과 연하관련 삶의 질,2024,"['Deglutition disorders', 'Depression', 'Esophageal neoplasms', 'Quality of life']",,"Objective: Depression is commonly seen in patients who have undergone surgery for esophageal cancer. The purpose of this study was to describe the degree of depression and dysphagia-specific quality of life (QoL) in patients who underwent surgery for esophageal cancer, to identify the relationship between depression and dysphagia-specific QoL and to find the factors affecting dysphagia-specific QoL.Methods: This study is a descriptive correlation study. The participants were 132 patients who had undergone esophageal cancer surgery at a university hospital in Seoul. Data were collected through a questionnaire from September 2022 to May 2023. The Korean version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (K-CESDR) and Dysphagia-specific QoL questionnaire were used. Data were analyzed using the t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression.Results: Forty-six (34.8%) participants showed a risk of depression and the mean dysphagia-specific QoL score was 65.83 (±15.83). There was a significant correlation between depression and the dysphagia-specific QoL. Factors that significantly affect the dysphagia-specific QoL were found to be marital status (β=−.16, P=.037), number of complications and level of discomfort (β=−.17, P=.036), depression (β=−.35, P＜.001), time elapsed post-surgery, and elapsed period over 3 years or post operative elapsed period (over 3 years) (β=.29, P＜.001). Among these factors, depression (β=−.35, P＜.001) had the maximum influence on dysphagia-specific QoL.Conclusion: Depression has a significant effect on the dysphagia-specific QoL of patients who underwent surgery for esophageal cancer. Therefore, it is necessary to develop proper interventions to reduce depression, complications, and the resultant discomfort associated with the surgery. We suggest developing more valid tools for measuring the dysphagia-specific QoL for cancer surgery patients."

For motion intention recognition, surface electromyogram (sEMG) and corresponding motion label is necessary. However, this process is time-consuming and it may increase the burden of the user. Therefore, we propose a simultaneous motion recognition framework using data augmentation based on muscle activation model. The model consists of multiple point sources to be optimized while the number of point sources and their initial parameters are automatically determined. From the experimental results, it is shown that the framework has generated the data which are similar to the real one. This aspect is quantified with the following two metrics: structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE). Furthermore, with k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) or support vector machine (SVM), the classification accuracy is also enhanced with the proposed framework. From these results, it can be concluded that the generalization property of the training data is enhanced and the classification accuracy is increased accordingly. We expect that this framework reduces the burden of the user from the excessive and time-consuming data acquisition."

In particular, owing to the micro/nanometer dimensions, it is difficult to analyze internal defect characteristics due to overlapping of surface signals using general pulse-echo ultrasound inspection. However, scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) demonstrates high performance in detecting defects in multi-layer structures with micro-thickness, offering quantitative analysis in a short time. This study presents an algorithm that determines the presence or absence of internal defects through the V(z) technique, which is mainly used in scanning acoustic microscopes, and quantitatively analyzes the characteristics of normal and abnormal cluster data based on reflectance functions. The results of k-means clustering for ten samples of normal and abnormal reflectance functions of the redistribution layer extracted through principle component analysis demonstrated the usefulness of performing defect discrimination by dispersing the cluster at distances 2.6 times higher in abnormal cluster data than in normal cluster data. The developed post-processing algorithm shows excellent performance in independent defect detection, indicating that high-frequency focused ultrasound transducer is an optimal choice for visualizing interface quality."

This study utilized data from the 2023 Food Consumption Behavior Survey conducted by the Korea Rural Economic Institute, analyzing responses from 1,004 participants aged 65 and older through factor analysis, K-means clustering, χ² tests, F-tests, and multiple regression analysis.The results of the analysis classified the dietary patterns of elderly consumers into convenience- oriented, taste-oriented, health-oriented, rational consumption-oriented, and safety-oriented groups. The health-oriented pattern was found to be the highest, followed by safety-oriented, taste-oriented, rational consumption-oriented, and convenience-oriented. The identified dietary types of elderly consumers based on these patterns were dietary-conscious (39%), health- oriented (21.2%), taste-oriented (16.6%), and indifference (23.1%), with dietary-conscious constituting the majority. The dietary-conscious type considers taste, convenience, and safety while leaning towards rational consumption with this group characterized as having the highest levels of income, education, health interest, and subjective health level among the groups. Health-oriented individuals prioritize safety and health, considering rational consumption, and ranked second after the dietary-conscious type, in terms of favorable socio-demographic conditions. Taste-oriented individuals prioritize taste and health, while the indifferecnt type does not have a specific dietary preference-these groups exhibited more vulnerable socio- demographic conditions. Subsequent analysis revealed significant differences in food consumption behavior and food consumer competence levels among elderly consumer types. The dietary- conscious type consistently showed the highest levels across all dimensions, followed by the health-oriented type, while the taste-oriented and indifferent types had lower levels. In terms of dietary satisfaction, the taste-oriented type ranked the highest, followed by the dietary- conscious, health-oriented, and indifferent types. The factors influencing dietary satisfaction varied significantly among the identified types. Based on these findings, this study proposed differentiated support measures for elderly consumers in promoting a healthy and satisfactory diet, as well as rational food consumption."

We aimed to categorize user behaviors into distinct clusters, investigate these clusters’ characteristics, and derive data-driven personas. First, we utilized DTW to cluster users by viewing patterns, recognizing that standard techniques like K-means and hierarchical clustering fall short with highly variable user logs. Our methodology accommodates the unique temporal dynamics of user interactions and allows for in-depth analysis of temporal distortions in viewing behaviors. Secondly, the study identified several user clusters, detailed their characteristics, and discussed their differences. This segmentation enables targeted marketing strategies and enhances user experience by tailoring content recommendations to specific preferences and behaviors. Lastly, the research leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct data-driven personas, minimizing subjective bias and maximizing objectivity by integrating comprehensive demographic and behavioral data into detailed user segments. The findings of this study are expected to significantly enhance the understanding of user behaviors on OTT platforms, aiding in the development of nuanced marketing strategies and personalized services.

We examined the transcriptomes of six different cultures, including sets of expression changes under constant dark (DD), constant light (LL), and diel-cycled (LD; 14 h light: 10 h dark) conditions at the exponential and stationary/death phases. Prepared mRNA extracted from the six samples was analyzed on the Solexa Genome Analyzer with 36 cycles. Differentially expressed genes on the IMCC1322 genome were distinguished as four clusters by K-mean clustering and each CDS (n = 2546) was annotated based on the KEGG BRITE hierarchy. Cluster 0 (n = 1573) covered most constitutive genes including proteorhodopsin, retinoids, and glycolysis/TCA cycle. Cluster 1 genes (n = 754) were upregulated in stationary/death phase under constant dark conditions and included genes associated with bacterial defense, membrane transporters, nitrogen metabolism, and senescence signaling.Cluster 2 genes (n = 197) demonstrated upregulation in exponential phase cultures and included genes involved in genes for oxidative phosphorylation, translation factors, and transcription machinery. Cluster 3 (n = 22) contained light-stimulated upregulated genes expressed under stationary/phases. Stringent response genes belonged to cluster 2, but affected genes spanned various cellular processes such as amino acids, nucleotides, translation, transcription, glycolysis, fatty acids, and cell wall components. The coordinated expression of antagonistic stringent genes, including mazG, ppx/gppA, and spoT/ relA may provide insight into the controlled cultural response observed between constant light and constant dark conditions in IMCC1322 cultures, regardless of cell numbers and biomass."

The findings demonstrate that the method of handling missing values can significantly impact research results. Traditional methods failed to detect the effect of career exploration behavior, while EM, MI and machine learning method revealed a statistically significant positive influence. This study aims to warn that the results may vary depending on how missing value is handled. Future studies should consider the pattern and causes of missingness for more accurate results."

However, a critical issue arises when acquired shares are not immediately destroyed but are strategically utilized for purposes like entrenching management control or influencing corporate governance, diverging from their intended use. These practices can potentially cause market confusion, yet there is a lack of sufficient research efforts to adequately monitor such activities or understand the implications and potential benefits of strategic treasury share utilization. This research adopts a machine learning approach to detect patterns in Korean corporations’ treasury share activities. Utilizing TS2000 data and applying K-means clustering, the study successfully differentiated three strategic choices related to treasury share disposition: financial treasury shares activities, passive treasury share activities, and active treasury share activities. Key differentiators such as total assets, total liabilities, and net income were identified. The findings of this research contribute to policy formulation and execution related to treasury shares and aid in the development of related monitoring systems and theoretical frameworks."

We analyzed the occurrence of this condition and clinical characteristics of the affected patients.Materials and Methods: The medical records of 474 patients diagnosed with acute prostatitis between June 2006 and July 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients in whom pathogens were not detected in serum or urine cultures were excluded. A total of 271 patients were included in the analysis. Patient characteristics and laboratory test results were compared between patients with acute prostatitis with and without liver abscesses.Results: Fifteen patients (5.5%) were identified with simultaneous liver abscesses and acute prostatitis. The liver abscess group was younger than the non-liver abscess group in terms of mean age. In the univariate analysis, a high proportion of patients had diabetes mellitus, whereas a low proportion had hypertension. None of the underlying diseases, including benign prostatic hyperplasia, malignancy, or alcoholism, demonstrated a significant association with liver abscess in multivariate analysis; however, an association was observed in liver function test results. All patients with liver abscesses tested positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae.Conclusions: When K. pneumoniae is identified in patients with acute prostatitis and abnormal liver function tests, considering the possibility of metastatic infection in other organs, including the liver, and performing an active evaluation is essential."

Second, even though he is not the person in charge, most of the official documents produced and received at patrol ships and substations are handled by one new police officer in charge of the task, which means that 64.7% of the new police officers have each person in charge of the relevant official documents in person. There was a strong sense that it had to be dealt with. Third, due to the complexity of work and lack of collaboration and communication, 83.3% of new police officers have felt the burden of work while processing official documents, and they have difficulty concentrating on processing official documents and participating in activities other than administrative work.As a way to improve this, it was proposed to produce and use a manual for writing and processing official documents for new police officers, designate experienced people as people in charge of general affairs, systematize the division of work, and strengthen practical training related to processing official documents."

The two types of roads are quite different in terms of their use. This study aims to develop indicators that can classify urban and rural roads. Firstly, it summarizes the main characteristics of urban and rural roads based on the previous literature. Then it suggests four quantitative indicators such as the number of crossings, access roads, property access points, and bus stops per kilometer. The application of these indicators to the arterial roads in Seoul and Ulsan metropolitan cities using K-means clustering analysis shows that it is appropriate to classify roads into three clusters. It turns out that cluster 1 represents rural roads, and clusters 2 and 3 represent urban roads. The developed indicators can be useful to identify road sections of speed limit reduction which is usually targeted to urban roads only. They also can be useful in deciding whether or not to install new crossings or access roads in the existing roads."

Natural radioactivity in soil is a significant factor for assessing environmental radiation exposure and potential health risks. The 226Ra, 232Th, and 40K radionuclides’ mean specific activities in the soil samples were in the 13.10–33.43 Bq/kg, 10.58–22.76 Bq/ kg, and 104.90–442.16 Bq/kg ranges, respectively, with overall means of 21.44 Bq/kg, 15.96 Bq/kg, and 255.50 Bq/kg, which are within the worldwide mean levels. The mean radium-equivalent activity (Raeq) was 63.94 Bq/ kg, and thus below the 370 Bq/kg international limit. All of the samples’ representative level index (Iɣ) and internal and external hazard indices (Hin and Hex) were below the limit of unity, indicating low radiation hazards.The absorbed dose rate resulting from the three primordial radionuclides was in the 19.92–41.46 nGy/h range (mean: 30.20 nGy/h), with an annual effective dose of 0.04 mSv/y. The mean excess lifetime risk of cancer was found to be 0.15 × 10⁻3, and thus under the 0.29 × 10⁻3 world average. The study’s results indicate that the natural radionuclides’ measured specific activities in the soil samples are below the world recommended values, suggesting that the investigated area is safe in terms of radiological health risks"

While anonymization is a key method for protecting personal information under the principles of Article 3 and Article 58-2 of the Personal Information Protection Act, it often creates a trade-off between data security and utility. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of anonymization on data utility, or information loss, in structured data (e.g., numerical and textual values), semi-structured transactional data, and unstructured image data. For structured data, this paper discusses traditional utility measures such as covariance, correlation, mean squared error, and absolute error, as well as utility measures within privacy protection models like k-anonymity. For semi-structured transactional data, it focuses on the km-anonymity model and the key utility measure used in this model, the Normalized Certainty Penalty (NCP). For unstructured image data, the utility is evaluated using contemporary measures such as Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) to assess the similarity between anonymized and original images. By thoroughly reviewing these measures, this paper aims to demonstrate that balancing anonymization and data utility remains a significant challenge for future research. Moreover, it seeks to contribute to organizations and businesses aiming to generate higher quality anonymized data for meaningful analysis. Future research will extend the discussion on utility measures to other forms of unstructured data, such as audio and text."
High-Voltage Transmission Line Foreign Object and Power Component Defect Detection Based on Improved YOLOv5,2024,['Transmission line inspection · Aerial images · Object detection · Recursive gated convolution'],,"With the outstanding performance of deep learning in the feld of computer vision, the automatic visual detection of foreign bodies in transmission lines and electrical equipment defects by inspection robots and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles based on neural networks has become an attractive topic in smart grid. However, in practical application scenarios, small-sized target defects pose a great challenge to the detection accuracy of existing mainstream deep learning detection networks with limited perceptual felds. To solve the above problems, the paper proposes a detection model of YOLOv5 transmission line inspection image. Firstly, the key target images under diferent backgrounds and attitudes are collected and preprocessed.Specifcally, in order to improve the perception ability of networks for small-sized targets, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to optimize the size of the anchor box, which efectively improves the ftting ability of the key target features. Then, recursive gated convolution is used as the backbone network to improve the ability to extract key target features. Finally, considering the concealment of small-scale features, the space-to-depth convolution module is added to the neck network to realize down-sampling and retain all the information in the channel dimension. In addition, a feature prediction layer is added to optimize the scale of network detection, and a Simple Parameter-Free Attention Module is added to further optimize the characterization of network features. The experimental results show that the accuracy and recall of the proposed network are 96.8% and 93.3%, respectively. The average detection accuracy reaches 97.1%, which is 3.8% higher than that of YOLOv5 network, 5.2% higher than YOLOv6 and 1.0% higher than that of YOLOv7 network. The proposed method signifcantly improves the detection performance of critical targets and defects of high-voltage transmission lines."

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Behavioral and Emotional Factors in Pediatric Patients with Headache,2024,"['COVID-19', 'Headache', 'Behavior', 'Emotions', 'Pediatrics']",,"Purpose: Headaches are common in childhood and adolescence and are often exacerbated by various triggers. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly altered daily life worldwide. In this study, we investigated potential behavioral and emotional changes among pediatric patients with headaches, treated either before or after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We examined 162 patients who visited our pediatric headache clinic between March 2018 and August 2021. The study included patients with primary headaches who completed a questionnaire assessing behavioral and psychiatric characteristics. We reviewed their clinical features, imaging studies, and scores on the Korean Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL), State Anxiety Inventory for Children (SAIC), Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, and Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI). Statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test, among other methods. Results: The 162 patients (mean age, 11.7±3.3 years) were classified based on whether they visited before (n=81) or after (n=81) the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The average CDI and SAIC scores were significantly higher in those who presented after pandemic onset. In this group, the odds ratio for an abnormal CDI score was 4.971. A weak positive correlation was found between the CDI score and the K-CBCL total problem score, with a correlation coefficient of 0.297. Conclusion: Pediatric patients visiting the headache clinic after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic exhibited significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to pre-pandemic visitors. Recognizing the considerable impact of the pandemic may help inform the management of pediatric headaches."

Adding a third element such as Feor Al is one of the useful ways to induce R-phase transformation. Controlling the R-phase transformationtemperature is crucial for industrial and bio-field applications. However, the effects of adding Fe haverarely been reported. In this study, the effects of Fe addition and heat treatment temperature on the Rphasetransformation temperature of TiNiFe shape memory alloys were systematically investigated.Results showed that increasing Fe composition decreases the R-phase and martensitic transformationtemperatures of 19K/1at%Fe and 51 K/1at%Fe, respectively. Additionally, in the Ti–49Ni–1Fe alloy,rather than a martensite transformation, the R phase transformation temperature was constantirrespective of heat treatment temperature and increasing number of thermal cycles. This means thatthe R-phase transformation temperature is not affected by dislocation density resulting from the heatcycling or cold working processes. This allows practical applications of R-phase transformation to beeasily realized. Furthermore, this means that the R-phase transformation temperature is only affectedby the Ni content of the matrix."

Among the diverse technological developments, ship-route clustering is emerging as an important technology for the commercialization of autonomous ships. Through route clustering, ship-route patterns are extracted from the sea to obtain the fastest and safest route and serve as a basis for the development of a collision-prevention system. High-quality, well-processed data are essential in ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of route-clustering algorithms. In this study, among the various route-clustering methods, we focus on the ship-route-similarity-based clustering method, which can accurately reflect the actual shape and characteristics of a route. To maximize the efficiency of this method, we attempt to formulate an optimal combination of data-preprocessing technologies. Specifically, we combine four methods of measuring similarity between ship routes and three dimensionality-reducing methods. We perform k-means cluster analysis for each combination and then quantitatively evaluate the results using the silhouette index to obtain the best-performing preprocessing combination. This study extends beyond merely identifying the optimal preprocessing technique and emphasizes the importance of extracting meaningful information from a wide range of ocean data. Additionally, this study can be used as a reference for effectively responding to the digital transformation of the maritime and shipping industry in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era."

Furthermore, through K-means cluster analysis, the Seoul population was classified into four types: ‘leisure-centered’, ‘residential-centered’, ‘work-centered’, and ‘residential-leisure complex’, and whether the three selected locations balancedly included the diversity of consumer life patterns. The maximum and minimum value differences between the four types existing within the coverage of each of the three selected locations were confirmed as the evaluation criteria. As a result, it was shown that the types were not concentrated in any one location, and thus the diversity was balanced. This will provide useful implications for responding appropriately to rapidly changing future demands when operating Urban Joint Courier Terminals in the future."

Unsupervised machine learning techniques can be a new approach to deriving important crash risk indicators. This paper applies a multi-stage methodology using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques systematically to evaluate crash risks. The proposed multi-stage methodology is composed of three stages. In the first stage, select variables that can classify risky and general traffic flow well using K-means clustering and Random forest. The second stage is the combination of variables that were derived in the first stage to construct important variable sets for detecting crash precursors. Lastly, third stage, crash prediction models with variable sets, which are selected from the second step, were developed using the support vector machine method. For the real-time crash prediction model, individual vehicle trajectory data were collected from commercial vehicles and used. As a result of this study, the multi-stage models that include variable selection through a combination of K-means clustering and Random Forest methods improved the predictive performance. This study proposes a new approach to selecting important variables that cannot be found by supervised learning when developing a crash prediction model. It is expected that more crashes can be prevented by performing proactive traffic safety management using the methodology suggested in this study."

However, there may be a gap between consumers’ self-reported perceptions and their observable actions. In response, this study aimed to investigate consumer purchasing behavior utilizing a big data approach. To this end, this study investigated the purchasing patterns of fashion items, both online and in retail stores, from a data-driven perspective. We also investigated whether individual consumers switched between online websites and retail establishments for making purchases. Data on 516,474 purchases were obtained from fashion companies. We used association rule analysis and K-means clustering to identify purchase patterns that were influenced by customer loyalty. Furthermore, sequential pattern analysis was applied to investigate the usage patterns of online and offline channels by consumers. The results showed that high-loyalty consumers mainly purchased infrequently bought items in the brand line, as well as high-priced items, and that these purchase patterns were similar both online and in stores. In contrast, the low-loyalty group showed different purchasing behaviors for online versus in-store purchases. In physical environments, the low-loyalty consumers tended to purchase less popular or more expensive items from the brand line, whereas in online environments, their purchases centered around items with relatively high sales volumes. Finally, we found that both high and low loyalty groups exclusively used a single preferred channel, either online or in-store. The findings help companies better understand consumer purchase patterns and build future marketing strategies around items with high brand centrality."
Decoding spatial precipitation patterns using artificial intelligence,2024,['Association rules Mining · Apriori algorithm · Rain Gauge Station'],,"The primary objective of this research is to examine the spatio-temporal variations in precipitation within the Indian Monsoon region (IMR), with a particular focus on regional relationships. This investigation utilizes rainfall data collected from rain gauge stations for the year 2020, a year marked by extreme weather events such as floods in Assam and Mumbai, Cyclone Amphan, and multiple cloud-bursts in the Western Himalayan regions. The time series analysis is conducted to find the precipitation patterns across six distinct geographical zones. A numerical association rule is formulated by leveraging both k-means clustering and Apriori techniques. The central finding of this study underscores the North Eastern region’s prominent co-occurrence pattern of rainfall events, particularly concerning lead days. Specifically, when there is rainfall in the preceding days, there is a notable likelihood of continued rainfall on the subsequent day. This prolonged and consecutive rainfall pattern, persisting for three successive days, emerges as a one of the major contributing factors to the flooding incidents experienced in these regions."

The content focused on changing emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal patterns that are key elements of counseling intervention for anxious and depressed youth. The developed program was implemented at two youth counseling and welfare centers to examine its effectiveness, one located in a metropolitan city and the other located in a medium-sized city. Participants were 19 adolescents in a treatment group and 20 adolescents in a control group, randomly assigned, and 14 counselors with more than 5 years of experience  working with youths. Measures used were the Youth Behavior Rating Scale (YSR), the Korean version of the Beck Anxiety Inventory(K-BAI), and the Korean version of the Beck Depression Inventory(K-BDI II). Results showed that there were statistically significant group differences only on the K-BAI and K-BDI-II scores, and there was no significant difference in the total score of K-YSR internalization. This would mean that the counseling intervention program developed in this study was effective in decreasing adolescents' internalizing problems and anxiety/depression problems. This study is significant in that it developed a highly field-sensitive counseling program for youths’ anxiety and depression and examined the effectiveness of the program so that it could be used in youth counseling organizations that provide counseling primarily to youths and individuals around them."

In this paper, we propose a method for optimizing workspace partitioning based on a weighted Voronoi diagram for fleet of autonomous tractors. The proposed method (1) acquires an image through UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) for the entire workspace and generates a node map for partitioning the workspace. (2) To calculate the center point of the workspace to be partitioned on the generated node map, the center point is calculated using the k-means clustering algorithm. (3) The workspace is differentially partitioned through the voronoi diagram algorithm and the performance-based weights for each tractor. (4) In order to minimize the deviation of task time, the workspace partitioning is optimized by adjusting the weights to reflect their relative importance. The proposed approach was validated through simulation. A comparison of the results before and after the optimization reveals a reduction in task time deviation. The results of the study indicate that optimized partitioning of the workspace can significantly enhance the operational efficiency of fleet of autonomous tractors, thereby improving agricultural productivity."

Vijñānabhairava, an ancient Indian yoga text, elaborates extensively on the core principles of Kaśmīra Śaivism and details 112 distinct methods of practice. This text holds a significant position in Śaivāgama philosophy. According to Swami Lakshmanjoo(1907~1991), Vijñānabhairava is purely monistic from the perspective of Bhairava, distinguishing it from the dualistic Śiva-Śāstra and the monistic-dualistic Rudra-Śāstra. Vijñānabhairava encapsulates the essence of the Rudrayamala Tantra, although the complete form of the Rudrayamala Tantra is no longer extant; portions of texts like Vijñānabhairava continue to be studied.Kṣemarāja, a prominent disciple of Abhinavagupta, contributed significantly to the understanding of Vijñānabhairava through his commentary, Udyota. Although incomplete, Udyota offers deep insights into the nature of Bhairava, addressing the threefold aspects of divinity. these commentaries have been supplemented by later scholars such as Shivopādhyāya and Bhaṭṭa Ananda. According to Kṣemarāja, the ultimate reality is manifested as the light of consciousness(prakāśa) and eternal awareness(vimarśa). This non-dual reality is symbolized through the unity of Śiva and Śakti, and the interplay between Bhairava and Bhairavī.Vijñānabhairava delineates 112 dhāraṇās, or concentration techniques, which are categorized into four upāyas(means or methods): Sāmbhavopāya, Śāktopāya, Āṇavopāya, and Anupāya. Each upāya represents a different level of consciousness and method of practice suitable for practitioners at various stages of spiritual development.Sāmbhavopāya is considered the highest and most refined method, requiring the practitioner to maintain awareness in a state devoid of thought. It is a direct path to realizing the supreme consciousness. Śāktopāya involves sustaining awareness within the realm of sensory perception and mental activities. Practitioners engage with their sensory experiences and subtle energies to transcend to higher states of consciousness. Āṇavopāya is suitable for those who rely on physical and mental activities, such as breath control and mantra recitation, to achieve concentration and spiritual awareness. Anupāya, literally meaning 'no method', represents a state where the practitioner, having mastered the other upāyas, transcends all methods and directly abides in the non-dual awareness. This is the realization that there is no distinction between the practitioner and the supreme consciousness.Vijñānabhairava remains a crucial text in the study of Non-Dual Śaivism, providing a comprehensive guide to various meditative techniques aimed at realizing the nature of ultimate reality. Through the efforts of scholars like Kṣemarāja, Shivopādhyāya, and Bhaṭṭa Ananda, the teachings of Vijñānabhairava have been preserved and continue to offer profound spiritual insights to practitioners. The categorization of dhāraṇās into four upāyas reflects the inclusive nature of this tradition, accommodating practitioners at different levels of spiritual evolution."

The cause of this conflict begins with Heidegger's concept of everydayness (Alltäglichkeit) on which the book relies. The relation between authenticity(Eigentlichkeit) and inauthenticity(Uneigentlichkeit) that emerges there undermines the horizontal relationship and counselee’s autonomy which are central concepts to philosophical counseling in their theory. This is because the very principles of methodology that underpin the counseling techniques contradict each other and the spirit of philosophical counseling that the book also presupposes. To resolve this, the book proposes transcendence, rooted in human finitude, as a means to achieve a higher understanding beyond the initial counselor-counselee understanding. This theory, centered on ""understanding"" oriented counseling, posits that enhancing understanding strengthens practice. Here, this philosophical counseling theory separates theory from practice. The practical elements, horizontal relationships and the counselee’s autonomy, are reduced to understanding, which leads to theoretical results that contradict the spirit of philosophical counseling. We therefore address Achenbach's mastery (Könnerschaft) and explore the possibility of solving their theoretical problems through a new possibility, the concept of excellence (Arete)."

Six machine learning algorithms such as, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were used t o construct seispic response prediction model. 13 intensity measures and 4 material properties were used input parameters of the training database. Performance evaluation was performed using metrics like root mean square error, mean square error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination. The optimization of hyperparameters was achieved through k-fold cross-validation and grid search techniques. The analysis results show that neural networks present good prediction performance considering aging deterioration."
Microplastics exposure altered hematological and lipid profiles as well as liver and kidney function parameters in albino rats (Rattus norvegicus),2024,"['Hematological parameters', 'Kidney function parameters', 'Lipid profiles', 'Liver function parameters', 'Microplastics']",,"The global occurrence of microplastics and their poorly understood health implications underscore the need for scientific investigation. This study aimed to assess the effects of microplastics exposure. Twenty-five (25) albino rats (Rattus norvegicus) were divided into five (5) groups, each consisting of five rats. Group 1 (the negative control) received normal feed; group 2 (the positive control) was administered a 10 % lead acetate solution; and groups 3, 4, and 5 were administered 1 %, 5 %, and 10 % microplastic solutions, respectively. The rats were monitored for 28 days, after which blood samples were taken for hematological and lipid profiles as well as liver and kidney function parameters. The results revealed dose-dependent significant (p < 0.05) alterations in the health indices of the treated rats and the positive control compared with the negative control. Specifically, the hematological parameters, including the white blood cells (WBC) and its subtypes, were reduced, indicating immunosuppressive effects, and the red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), platelets, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were reduced, indicating anemia. The 1 % and 5 % microplastic solutions raised the lipid profiles of the treated rats, including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), while the 10 % concentration decreased them, causing hyperlipidemia and hypolipidemia, respectively. The liver function parameters, including total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), were elevated, indicating liver damage. Elevation of kidney function parameters, including sodium ion (Na+), potassium ion (K+), chloride ion (Cl-), urea, and creatinine (CRT), were noticed, suggesting kidney injuries. It can be inferred from these results that microplastics are toxic. Hence, human exposure to microplastics should be reduced to a minimum."
Skin benefits of postbiotics derived from Micrococcus luteus derived from human skin: an untapped potential for dermatological health,2024,['Skin microbiome · Postbiotics · Dehydration · Inflammation · Recovery'],,"Background The skin microbiome, a diverse community of microorganisms, plays a crucial role in maintaining skin health. Among these microorganisms, the gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus exhibits potential for promoting skin health. This study focuses on postbiotics derived from M. luteus YM-4, a strain isolated from human skin.Objective Our objective is to explore the beneficial effects of YM-4 culture filtrate on dermatological health, including enhancing barrier function, modulating immune response, and aiding recovery from environmental damage.Methods The effects of the YM-4 culture filtrate were tested on human keratinocytes and fibroblasts under various conditions using real-time PCR for gene expression analysis and fibroblast migration assays. A dehydration-simulated model was employed to prepare RNA-Seq samples from HaCaT cells treated with the YM-4 culture filtrate. Differentially expressed genes were identified and functionally classified through k-means clustering, gene ontology terms enrichment analyses, and protein-protein interactions mapping.Results The YM-4 culture filtrate enhanced the expression of genes involved in skin hydration, hyaluronic acid synthesis, barrier function, and cell proliferation. It also reduced inflammation markers in keratinocytes and fibroblasts under stress conditions. It mitigated UVB-induced collagen degradation while promoted collagen synthesis, suggesting anti-aging properties, and accelerated wound healing processes by promoting cell proliferation and migration. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the YM-4 culture filtrate could reverse dehydration-induced transcriptional changes towards a state similar to untreated cells.Conclusion M. luteus YM-4 culture filtrate exhibits significant therapeutic potential for dermatological applications."
마음챙김(Mindfulness) 기반 치유문화의 비판적 고찰 - MBSR을 중심으로 -,2024,"['Healing Culture', 'MBSR', 'Mindfulness', 'Neoliberalism', 'Spirituality', '치유문화', 'MBSR', '마음챙김', '신자유주의', '영성']","현재 한국불교 신행현장에서 가장 주목받고 있는 현상은 마음챙김(Mindfulness) 기반 치유문화라 할 수 있다. 서구 심리학 및 정신의학계에서 마음챙김을 적극 응용, 활용하는 모습에 고무된 불교계는 거의 무비판적으로 마음챙김에 기반한 다양한 서구의 심신 치유프로그램을 수용하여 대중화하고 있다. 나아가 전통불교 수행법과 치유를 접목한 연구 및 프로그램 개발에도 지대한 관심을 보인다.존 카밧진(Jon Kabat-Zinn, 1944~)은 만성질환이나 통증 환자들의 스트레스를 감소시키기 위한 치유프로그램인 MBSR(Mindfulness Based on Stress Reduction, 마음챙김 기반 스트레스 완화)을 창안하여 대중화에 성공하였다. 현재 MBSR은 전 세계적으로 인기를 끌고 있으며, 국내에서도 심리학계를 중심으로 심리상담과 치료에 적극 활용되고 있다. 심지어 K-MBSR 프로그램까지 개발되어 보급 중이다. 하지만 서구에서 MBSR이 확산되는 과정에서 다르마(Dharma)의 방편(upāya)적 활용이라는 긍정적인 평가가 있는 한편, 불교수행의 변형과 왜곡, 신자유주의 사회에서 영적 상업화라는 부정적인 비판도 만만치 않다.이에 마음챙김 기반 프로그램들의 시원이라 할 수 있는 MBSR을 중심으로 마음챙김의 의미와 전통적 불교 수행법인 위빠사나의 사띠(sati)와의 상관성 및 치유문화로서 마음챙김 현상을 비판적으로 고찰해 보고자 한다.동・서 문화의 만남은 한국불교 신행현장에도 고스란히 그 영향을 미치고 있다. 그동안 한국불교는 선원 중심적, 남성적, 엘리트주의적, 출가 중심적, 권위주의적 에토스(ethos)가 지배적이었다. 21세기 영성의 시대를 맞아 여성적, 수용 공감적, 대중적, 민주적인 불교로 리모델링 될 필요가 제기되는 가운데 치유문화는 하나의 대안으로 부상하고 있다. 하지만 위험 요인도 감지되는 만큼 내면적, 개인적인 마음챙김뿐 아니라 대외적, 사회 참여적 마음챙김의 중요성을 인식하여 시의적절하게 대처해 간다면, 불교의 근본 취지인 이고득락(離苦得樂)을 구현할 수 있는 새로운 장을 열어갈 수 있으리라 기대된다.","Currently, the phenomenon that is attracting the most attention in the field of Korean Buddhism can be said to be a healing culture based on mindfulness.Inspired by the active application and use of mindfulness in Western psychology and psychiatry, the Buddhist community is almost uncritically accepting and popularizing various Western mind-body healing programs based on mindfulness. Furthermore, the Buddhist community shows great interest in research and program development that combines traditional Buddhist practice and healing.Jon Kabat-Zinn (1944~) created and successfully popularized MBSR (Mindfulness Based on Stress Reduction), a healing program to reduce stress in patients with chronic diseases or pain. Currently, MBSR is gaining popularity around the world, and is being actively used in psychological counseling and treatment in Korea as well, especially in the psychology community. Even the K-MBSR program has been developed and is being distributed. However, in the process of spreading MBSR in the West, there is positive evaluation that it is an expedient (upāya) use of Dharma, while negative criticism that it is a transformation and distortion of Buddhist practice and spiritual commercialization in neoliberal society is also significant.Accordingly, focusing on MBSR, which can be said to be the origin of mindfulness-based programs, we would like to critically examine the meaning of mindfulness, its correlation with sati of Vipassanā, a traditional Buddhist practice, and the phenomenon of mindfulness as a healing culture.The encounter between Eastern and Western cultures is having a lasting impact on Korean Buddhist practice. So far, Korean Buddhism has been dominated by a Zen-centered, masculine, elitist, monastic, and authoritarian ethos. In the era of spirituality in the 21st century, healing culture is emerging as an alternative as there is a need to remodel Buddhism into a feminine, accepting, empathetic, popular, and democratic Buddhism. However, as risk factors are detected, if we recognize the importance of not only internal and personal mindfulness, but also external and social participation mindfulness, and respond in a timely manner, we can realize the fundamental purpose of Buddhism, which is achieving success, leaving suffering, and gaining joy. I look forward to opening a new chapter."

Additionally, it explores how this concept can be used extensively today. To this end, this study first discusses the meaning categories of “independence of the part” when it was first created in 1969, and the problems that have been pointed out regarding this concept since then, including a proposal of the concept of “maximizing of the scene,” and why the concept of “independence of the part” is still valid. Furthermore, this study considers what premises are required to use this concept more effectively in the future.In an era abundant with cultural content, when the creative succession of pansori is required, this study suggests through three main aspects how “independence of the part” can be effectively utilized: as a channel for raising critical question about the social reality; a channel for reflecting contemporary elements of interest; and as a channel for experimenting with new versions and repertoires. It confirms that “independence of the part” has the power to make the meaning of the pansori text open to various interpretations, ensuring pansori remains a living heritage rather than just a remnant of past cultural heritage. Furthermore, it is crucial for efficiently eliciting other content.In the 21st century, Korean Wave and the rise of K-contents have attracted attention worldwide. Nevertheless, serious consideration of “Korean storytelling” seems necessary for sustainable development and strong competitiveness. The final suggestion is that “independence of the part” can function as a key principle and qualification of such Korean storytelling. It is hoped that the discussion presented here will serve as an opportunity to actively pay attention to the potential of “independence of the part” in the creation, criticism, and research of pansori and other Korean story contents today."

Then, the aspect of marking in plural place names for which Chinese characters corresponded to Korean characters were investigated and phonetic phenomena and dialect vocabulary were interpreted.The errors in marking were judged as simple mistakes of recording based on the correspondence between place names in Chinese and Korean characters. However, they were differentiated from misspelling and markings reflecting phonetic phenomena or dialects.The field names as place names were marked in Korean and Chinese characters, which were intended to interpret based on Chaja Pyogi (loan-character writing system). The place names as compounds were categorized into the fore and the rear for interpretation. The rear part was marked ‘Pyong’ and ‘Ya’ in Chinese characters and ‘Deul’ in Korean character. In Korean marking, ‘Deul’ was frequently omitted. The fore part was categorized into transliteration, Korean transcription of Chinese meaning, and mixed transcription.For the monophthongized ‘ae’, ‘ᄋᆡ’ was actively used for marking of native words.

In regions where LCCs first entered the market, such as Europe and North America, traditional full-service carriers (FSCs) and LCCs have increasingly adopted each other’s characteristics, leading to a blending of business models. Previous research has focused on airlines in these regions. Unlike the existing studies, which are based on long-haul operations in Europe and North America, this study conducts a cluster analysis to examine the expansion of hybrd airline business models which lie between the traditional FSC and LCC categories, focusing on medium-haul carriers in the Asian region based on Korean routes. For this purpose, the study analyzed 34 Asian medium-haul carriers operating in Korea using variables such as network density, flight frequency, checked baggage, in-flight meals, corporate loyalty programs, frequent flyer miles, codesharing, airline alliances, seat density, seat configuration, employee-to-aircraft ratio, labor unions, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), aircraft age, fleet composition, and fares. The k-means clustering methodology was applied. The analysis identified four clusters, including two additional clusters beyond the basic FSC and LCC models. The FSC model, as generally recognized in the market, was concentrated in the FSC and Hybrid1 clusters, while the LCC model was focused in the LCC and Hybrid2 clusters. The FSC cluster (10 airlines) maintained the traditional characteristics of full-service carriers, comprising mainly large, established airlines with long histories. The Hybrid1 cluster (8 airlines) exhibited a mix of FSC and LCC characteristics in terms of ancillary services and operational features, including relatively smaller traditional full-service carriers compared to those in the FSC cluster. The Hybrid2 cluster (5 airlines) showed strong LCC traits, particularly in aspects such as seat configuration and in-flight service, but displayed more features in FSC including mileage programs, airline alliances, seat density, and employee-to-aircraft ratios, with major domestic LCCs such as Jeju Air, Jin Air, and T’way forming this cluster. The LCC cluster (11 airlines) clearly exhibited the typical characteristics of low-cost carriers across most variables, including leading LCCs from Southeast Asia. The results confirm that the business models of Asian airlines are increasingly hybridized, providing implications for the strategic development of airline business models such as integration of flexible attributes, introduction and improvement of LCC alliance, and reinforcement of ancillary strategy."

Results show that DLZ measure with adopting four symbolic sequence(k=4) is appropriate for muscle fatigue estimation and the conventional MDF measure is more robust (over mean 12%) and sensitive(over mean 88%) than three LZ complexity measures(LZ, PLZ, DLZ) for estimating muscle fatigue from surface EMG signal."
Phenotypic characterization of underutilized common wheat germplasm for diversifying breeding materials in Korea,2024,"['Wheat', 'Germplasm', 'Genetic diversity', 'Agronomic trait', 'Breeding']",,"Wheat, one of the most important cereal crops globally, stands as the second most consumed crop in Korea following rice. However, the self-sufficiency rate of wheat is extremely low (1.1%, as of 2021) in Korea, leading to an excessive dependency on imports. Therefore, developing wheat varieties with high productivity and quality for Korean environments is crucial to improve self-sufficiency. As wheat breeding in Korea has mainly focused on developing early-maturing varieties suitable for the rice-wheat double cropping system, genetic diversity is highly limited. Hence, it is essential to establish a genetically diverse germplasm pool to discover and utilize valuable breeding materials for the development of competitive varieties. This study has two main objectives: (i) Assess genetic diversity among 359 underutilized wheat accessions from 45 countries based on a comparative analysis of nine key agronomic traits. (ii) Select superior accessions which can be utilized for building a breeding population. The agronomic traits of the 359 wheat accessions exhibited wide variation. Using principal component and k-means cluster analyses, the 359 accessions were classified into three groups, and characteristics among these groups were compared to analyze genetic diversity within the population. Based on the results, accessions with superior spikelet number per spike (SNS) and thousand grain weight (TGW) were selected for further use in breeding and genetic analysis."

However, aside from the publications of Adolf Fischer, Berta Gottsche, William Cohn, and Andreas Eckardt in the 1910s and 1920s, Korean art was not independently addressed until 1945. Typically, Korean art was briefly cited or succinctly defined in the context of explaining Chinese and Japanese art. The primary focus was its connections to Chinese art and ceramics, a domain highly regarded by the Japanese. German art historians often praised the sculptures of Seokguram not for their distinctive Korean aesthetic but as exemplary monuments of the Tang Dynasty’s Buddhist art. Korean art was received as an unoriginal echo of Chinese art. Similarly, while Goryeo celadon was sometimes deemed to achieve moments of perfection akin to that of Chinese porcelain, Korean ceramics were generally regarded as crude imitations of Chinese works, notwithstanding their admiration within the Japanese tea culture. More importantly, the German art historical approach to Korean art was closely aligned with Japanese perspectives. Such resources as Japan’s East Asian art magazine Kokka, the antique art collection Shimbi Taikan, and government-published works (e.g., Chosen Kofun Hekigwa and Chosen Koseki Zufu) were utilized as foundational references. This reliance suggests that the narrative in German art history mirrored Japanese scholarly research. Additionally, influential German art historians and museum professionals like Otto K䟮mmel and Ernst Grosse traveled to Japan, fostering intimate exchanges. This reality underscores the fact that access to Korean art was mediated through Japan. German art historians viewed Japanese-led excavations as opportunities to protect Korean cultural heritage and fill the gaps in East Asian art history, often justifying Japan’s colonial rule as a cultural endeavor. In early 20th-century historical literature on German art, Korean art was framed as a shadow of grand Chinese art, thus denying it an independent identity. Furthermore, a common belief was that all artistic vitality in Korea disappeared following Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s invasions. Notably, while China was positioned as the creative origin and dominant center of East Asian art, Japan was portrayed as the place where East Asian art reached its zenith. This narrative aligns with Japan’s political rise as a colonial power in Asia, with Japan emerging as the representative hub of East Asian art in German literature. On the other hand, Korea and its art were persistently depicted as the cultural underdogs and losers in East Asian history. The question of whether German art historical literature, which failed to identify artistic significance in Korean art, underwent changes after World War II remains a topic for further investigation. Uncovering and critically examining the German tradition of East Asian art history imposed on Korean art and reevaluating Korean art will allow the global phenomenon of K-culture to be appreciated not as a superficial trend but with genuine meaning"

The key medium of interaction under analysis is the saugha, the Mongol’s gift culture. The independence of Goryeo within the empire will become clear through comparisons with similar cases in other states subjugated to the Mongols, such as Armenia and Georgia.In the grasslands of Mongolia, there were three actions a monarch could carry out for the sake of effective rule: ideological, violent, and/or economic. The empire’s great Qan demanded massive gifts from Goryeo possibly periodically. William of Rubruck, a Franciscan missionary, noted: “They (Caule and Manse, or Korea and southern China) offered thirty-two thousand tumens of iascot a year provided that the Tartars left them undisturbed (A tumen is a number equivalent to ten thousand).” These gifts must have been a form of Mongol-style either saugha or taxation on Goryeo, meant to help establish new economic and diplomatic relations between the two courts. This caused the Goryeo court to increase its gwaryeom (科斂 kēliǎn in Chinese), or levy, on its people.Meanwhile, the Goryeo court wanted to avoid the Mongol’s “massive annual” saugha or taxation. It did so thanks to a defensive logic that helped it to avoid imperial taxation thanks to its weakness due to its narrow territory and small productive capacity. In this way, its people transformed the imperial system within their kingly domain as it reduced burdens and increased benefits."

To this end, We would like to focus on the potential and possibility of new convergence content that combines the traditional values ​ and modern meaning of the novel."
Comparative Thermal Evaluation of Two Systems of Wall Panels Exposed to Hot and Arid Arabian Environmental Weather Conditions,2024,"['Thermal performance', 'Thermal transmittance', 'Thermal resistance', 'Wall panel', 'Heat flow rate']",,Thermal evaluation of twin wall panel systems was assessed under vibrant hot and arid conditions of weather in the Arabian Peninsula. Two systems of wall panels (0.6 m × 0.6 m) were prepared. The first system was prepared with a 5.0 cm thick extruded polystyrene (XPS) board. While the second system was prepared with 5.0 cm thick layer of foam-mortar encompassing expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads. Both the thermal insulative layers were sandwiched between two 7.5 cm thick concrete layers. The two wall panel systems were thermally evaluated at the same time in a carefully designed test room. Comparison was accomplished between the two wall systems by measuring the U-value (thermal transmittance) and R-value (resistance). The U-value (air to air) for sandwiched XPS concrete wall system was 0.837 W/m2 K while it was 2.527 W/m2 K for sandwiched EPS beads foam-mortar concrete wall system. The mean U-values (surface to surface) of the sandwiched XPS concrete wall system was 1.143 m2 K/W and 0.293 m2 K/W for sandwiched EPS beads foam-mortar concrete wall system. The sandwiched XPS concrete wall system was more efficient than the sandwiched EPS beads foam-mortar concrete wall system in terms of thermal performance. About 4.5 h of time lag was observed for both the wall panel systems between the external surface temperature and the heat transmission in the internal surface. The output of the FEM simulation by ABAQUS is compared with the measured data for Set-1 (period 16-Aug-2022 to 26-Aug-2022). The hourly temperature change on the outer and inner surfaces has good agreement for both sandwiched XPS concrete wall system and sandwiched EPS beads foam-mortar concrete wall system. The simulation can also predict the heat flux through the two wall systems investigated.
Comparison of Lambertian Model on Multi-Channel Algorithm for Estimating Land Surface Temperature Based on Remote Sensing Imagery,2024,"['Lambertian model', 'Sun-Canopy-Sensor', 'Cosine correction']",,"The Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter in identifying drought. It is essential to identify how LST can increase its accuracy, particularly in mountainous and hill areas. Increasing the LST accuracy can be achieved by applying early data processing in the correction phase, specifically in the context of topographic correction on the Lambertian model. Empirical evidence has demonstrated that this particular stage effectively enhances the process of identifying objects, especially within areas that lack direct illumination. Therefore, this research aims to examine the application of the Lambertian model in estimating LST using the Multi-Channel Method (MCM) across various physiographic regions. Lambertian model is a method that utilizes Lambertian reflectance and specifically addresses the radiance value obtained from Sun-Canopy-Sensor(SCS) and Cosine Correction measurements. Applying topographical adjustment to the LST outcome results in a notable augmentation in the dispersion of LST values. Nevertheless, the area physiography is also significant as the plains terrain tends to have an extreme LST value of ≥ 350 K. In mountainous and hilly terrains, the LST value often falls within the range of 310-325 K. The absence of topographic correction in LST results in varying values: 22 K for the plains area, 12-21 K for hilly and mountainous terrain, and 7-9 K for both plains and mountainous terrains. Furthermore, validation results indicate that employing the Lambertian model with SCS and Cosine Correction methods yields superior outcomes compared to processing without the Lambertian model, particularly in hilly and mountainous terrain. Conversely, in plain areas, the Lambertian model's application proves suboptimal. Additionally, the relationship between physiography and LST derived using the Lambertian model shows a high average R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.99. The lowest errors(K) and root mean square error values, approximately ±2 K and 0.54, respectively, were achieved using the Lambertian model with the SCS method. Based on the findings, this research concluded that the Lambertian model could increase LST values. These corrected values are often higher than the LST values obtained without the Lambertian model."

To enable multiple UAVs to perform various missions while maintaining close proximity and avoiding collisions, we develop a hybrid-flocking control algorithm that combines three types of control protocols: vector field guidance for path following and loitering, the augmented Cucker–Smale model for collective flocking behavior, and a potential field for collision avoidance. Additionally, to address the requirements of different mission scenarios, we define several swarm modes: swarm collective loitering for cohesive circling at the same altitude, swarm group loitering for circling at different altitudes, swarm movement for flocking flight toward a target point, and individual loitering for single UAV circling. To reduce the risk of collisions during mode transitions, we employ k-means clustering to form subgroups and optimize control weights within the hybrid-flocking control algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated through simulations of swarm mission scenarios. These simulations demonstrate that missions can be performed safely without collisions by utilizing optimized weights for the various swarm modes."

Microsatellite and nanosatellite imageries provide a tool for continuous and accurate monitoring of water bodies at high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, PlanetScope imagery with a resolution of 3.7 m and High-Resolution Network (HRNet) model were used to detect water bodies at dams and rivers in Korea, with the objective of evaluating the utility of water surface area monitoring. The HRNet model and the optimal band combinations of PlanetScope imagery which were R+G+B, R+G+B+NIR, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Green+NIR+ NDWI, were initially evaluated. The Green+NIR+NDWI combination performed the best, with an accuracy of 0.91 and loss function of 0.05 for the validation set. Water body detection was performed using the HRNet model with the optimal band combination and models from previous studies (Otsu, K-means, U-net) The performance was evaluated through quantitative validation using labeled images. The HRNet model showed the best performance with an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.96, compared to models in previous studies (Otsu: 0.90, K-means: 0.92, U-net: 0.95). Additionally, the HRNet model’s flood detection performance showed an IoU of 0.93, indicating a high accuracy. However, there were limitations, as muddy and wet soil at the boundaries of flooded areas were false detected as water bodies. In the future, when a constellation of microsatellites is developed in Korea, the results of this study are expected to contribute to better management of water resources and water-related disasters through continuous monitoring of water bodies."

However, as the scale of renewable energy deployment increases and its impact on the national grid grows, it is becoming important to forecast power generation for not only commercial solar facilities but also self-consumption solar facilities. As of April 2024, more than 130,000 solar installations have been connected to REMS. It is not economically efficient to forecast the generation of these small installations individually, and the level of accuracy required for self-consuming solar facilities is not as high. Therefore, suitable monitoring techniques are required. In this study, Chungcheongbuk-do, situated midway in the ranking of REMS-connected municipal solar facilities, was selected as the priority target. The objective is to group 11,268 power plants in the Chungcheongbuk-do region and select a representative power plant for each group. The clustering algorithm employs various factors, including latitude, longitude, insolation, altitude, and power generation history, to group power plants. It utilizes both K-means and Autoencoder techniques. First, the location of each solar facility was converted into latitude and longitude values using the address information of the solar facilities connected to REMS. The altitude and insolation information for each location were then extracted based on the latitude and longitude values for clustering analysis. Second, a methodology is proposed using power utilization data from January to December 2023 to identify normally operating facilities and cluster power generation by targeting them."

A Machine Learning Approach to ADHD Diagnosis Using Mutual Information and Stacked Classifiers,2024,"['EEG', 'ADHD', 'Machine learning', 'Mutual information', 'PCA', 'Stacked classifier']",,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental conditionin children characterized by impairments in attention, hyperactivity, and impulse control.Despite extensive research, the underlying cause of ADHD remains unclear. Electroen-cephalography (EEG), a noninvasive method for recording brain activity, is valuable forstudying ADHD-related neural patterns. This study explored the potential of EEG data todifferentiate children with ADHD and Healthy Controls (HC) to enhance diagnostic accuracy.We analyzed EEG recordings from 61 children with ADHD and 60 healthy controls. TheEEG data comprised signals from 19 scalp channels. Our primary objective was to develop amachine learning model capable of classifying ADHD subjects with ADHD from HC usingEEG data as discriminatory features. To select the most relevant features, we utilized mutualinformation (MI), a measure of the statistical dependence between two variables. The topfeatures were selected based on their minimum MI values, ensuring that they captured mean-ingful information from both ADHD and HC groups. Principal component analysis (PCA)was employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving the essential features, aiming tomitigate computational complexity. The selected features were then used to train ten differentclassifiers: random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),extra tree classifier (ET), XGBoost (XGB), support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression(LR), adaboost, classification and regression trees (CART), and gradient boosting machines(GBM). A stacked classifier was constructed by combining the outputs of all ten individualclassifiers, with the MLP acting as a meta-classifier. The stacked classifier outperformedindividual models, achieving an impressive accuracy of 92%. Its precision (91%) and sen-sitivity (93%) were also higher than those of the individual models, indicating its ability tocorrectly identify ADHD-positive cases. Furthermore, the specificity of the stacked classifier(93%) was superior, highlighting its improved proficiency in correctly classifying HC. Thiscomprehensive evaluation established the stacked classifier as an effective approach for ADHDclassification, surpassing the performance of several standalone models. Our proposed methodoffers a noninvasive, objective, and cost-effective method for identifying children with ADHD,leading to earlier diagnosis, intervention, and improved treatment outcomes."

The Batanghari River, Sumatra’s longest river, is polluted by mercury-containing illegal gold mining waste (PETI), industrial pollution, and domestic waste. Several studies have provided evidence suggesting a decline in fish biodiversity within the Batanghari River. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the present status of biodiversity in this river is currently lacking. The species under investigation were identified through various molecular-based identification methods, as well as morphological identification, which involved the use of neighbor-joining (NJ) trees. All collected specimens were initially identified using morphological techniques and subsequently confirmed with molecular barcoding analysis. Morphological and DNA barcoding identification categorized all specimens (1,692) into 36 species, 30 genera and 16 families, representing five orders. A total of 36 DNA barcodes were generated from 30 genera using a 650-bp-long fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Based on the Kimura two-parameter model (K2P), The minimum and maximum genetic divergences based on K2P distance were 0.003 and 0.331, respectively, and the average genetic divergence within genera, families, and orders was 0.05, 0.12, 0.16 respectively. In addition, the average interspecific distance was approximately 2.17 times higher than the mean intraspecific distance. Our results showed that the COI barcode enabled accurate fish species identification in the Batanghari River. Furthermore, the present work will establish a comprehensive DNA barcode library for freshwater fishes along Batanghari River and be significantly useful in future efforts to monitor, conserve, and manage fisheries in Indonesia."

Identification of Preeclamptic Placenta in Whole Slide Images Using Artificial Intelligence Placenta Analysis,2024,"['Placenta', 'Preeclampsia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Unsupervised Learning']",,"Background: Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive pregnancy disorder linked to placental dysfunction, often involving pathological lesions like acute atherosis, decidual vasculopathy, accelerated villous maturation, and fibrinoid deposition. However, there is no gold standard for the pathological diagnosis of PE and this limits the ability of clinicians to distinguish between PE and non-PE pregnancies. Recent advances in computational pathology have provided the opportunity to automate pathological analysis for diagnosis, classification, prediction, and prediction of disease progression. In this study, we assessed whether computational pathology could be used to identify PE placentas.Methods: A total of 168 placental whole-slide images (WSIs) of patients from Seoul National University Hospital (comprising 84 PE cases and 84 normal controls) were used for model development and internal validation. For external validation of the model, 76 placental slides (including 38 PE cases and 38 normal controls) were obtained from the Boramae Medical Center (BMC). To establish standard criteria for diagnosing PE and distinguishing it from controls using placental WSIs, patch characteristics and quantification of terminal and intermediate villi were employed. In unsupervised learning, K-means clustering was conducted as a feature obtained through an Auto Encoder to extract the ratio of each cluster for each WSI. For supervised learning, quantitative assessments of the villi were obtained using a U-Net-based segmentation algorithm. The prediction model was developed using an ensemble method and was compared with a clinical feature model developed by using placental size features.Results: Using ensemble modeling, we developed a model to identify PE placentas.The model showed good performance (area under the precision-recall curve [AUPRC], 0.771; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.752–0.790), with 77.3% of sensitivity and 71.1% of specificity, whereas the clinical feature model showed an AUPRC 0.713 (95% CI, 0.694–0.732) with 55.6% sensitivity and 86.8% specificity. External validation of the predictive model employing the BMC-derived set of placental slides also showed good discrimination (AUPRC, 0.725; 95% CI, 0.720–0.730).Conclusion: The proposed computational pathology model demonstrated a strong ability to identify preeclamptic placentas. Computational pathology has the potential to improve the identification of PE placentas."

In structural engineering area, machine learning is generally used to predict structural responses of building structures. The aging deterioration of reinforced concrete structure affects its structural behavior. Therefore, the aging deterioration of R.C. structure should be consider to exactly predict seismic responses of the structure. In this study, the machine learning based seismic response prediction model was developed. To this end, four machine learning algorithms were employed and prediction performance of each algorithm was compared. A 3-story coupled shear wall structure was selected as an example structure for numerical simulation. Artificial ground motions were generated based on domestic site characteristics. Elastic modulus, damping ratio and density were changed to considering concrete degradation due to chloride penetration and carbonation, etc. Various intensity measures were used input parameters of the training database. Performance evaluation was performed using metrics like root mean square error, mean square error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination. The optimization of hyperparameters was achieved through k-fold cross-validation and grid search techniques. The analysis results show that neural networks and extreme gradient boosting algorithms present good prediction performance."
비법정계획을 활용한 참여형 도시계획에 관한 연구,2024,"['독일 공간계획체계', '도시개발', '참여형 도시계획', '비법정계획', '플란베르크', 'German Spatial Planning System', 'Urban Development', 'Participatory Urban Planning', 'Non-Statutory Planning', 'Planwerk']","(연구 배경 및 목적) 도시계획 과정에서 시민참여는 사회적 합의를 통해 시민의 요구를 정책에 반영하고 실행 과정에서의 갈등을 최소화할 수 있는 중요한 요소이다. 독일은 국가 예산으로 추진되는 도시개발이나 도시재생사업 등에 시민의 자발적인 참여도가 매우 높은 나라이다. 도시계획 과정에서 시민참여는 독일 연방 차원의 건설 법전(BauGB)을 통해 제도화되어 있으며, 도시계획의 수립 및 집행 권한이 있는 지자체는 조례 제정과 비법정계획을 통해 이를 보장하고 있다. 즉, 도시의 발전 방향에 대한 초기 구상에서부터 구체적인 개발계획의 수립, 실행에 이르기까지 폭넓은 시민참여를 통해 도시를 만들어가는 과정이 시스템화되어 있다. 따라서 독일의 비법정계획 연구를 통하여 참여형 도시계획에 대한 이해를 증진시키고 도시계획적 시사점 및 국내 적용 방안을 도출하고자 한다. (연구 방법) 선행연구 고찰을 통하여 비법정계획 및 참여형 도시계획과 관련한 선행연구의 동향을 파악한다. 제도 고찰을 통하여 독일 도시계획 제도의 체계와 특징 그리고 비법정계획에 관해 연구한다. 독일의 도시계획 과정에서 수립되는 계획간의 연관관계를 살펴본다. 참여형 도시계획 사례연구는 독일 베를린의 철도부지 도시개발 사례인‘어마네 미테(Urbane Mitte)’와 산업부지 도시개발 사례인‘지멘스 슈타트 2.0(Siemens Stadt 2.0)’를 대상으로 한다. 이와 함께 국내 대구 K-2 군공항 부지 개발을 위한‘K-2 스카이시티’도시개발 사례를 함께 분석하여 독일 비법정계획의 활용을 통한 계획수립의 특징, 특히 시민참여형 계획의 관점에서 국내외 도시계획의 차이점 분석한다. (결과) 참여형 도시계획과 관련한 독일의 도시개발 사례의 경우 비법정계획을 통해 사업의 전 과정에서 시민의 폭넓은 참여가 보장되는 제도적 장치가 존재함을 파악하였다. 또한 계획과정에서 단순히 의견을 제시하는 수준을 넘어서 계획안 작성에 참여하거나, 공모전 심사에까지 참여하는 등 역할과 권한이 크다. 즉, 시민참여에 대한 공공 차원의 시스템적인 지원뿐 아니라 시민 스스로 지역을 개발하고 발전시키는데 주체적으로 참여하며, 노력을 하는 것으로 이해할 수 있다. 국내 사례의 경우 도시에 발전에 큰 영향을 미치는 대규모 개발사업임에도 시민참여는 매우 제한적으로 진행되며, 공공 주도의 하향식 계획수립 및 개발이 진행되는 것으로 파악되었다. (결론) 독일의 비법정계획은 도시의 미래상을 입체적･공간적으로 설계하고, 유연한 계획을 통해 다양하고 유연한 대안적 계획안을 작성하는 것이 특징이다. 또한 이 과정에서 투명한 절차를 통해 다양한 이해관계자가 공동으로 참여하여 계획안을 만들어 나가고, 이는 사회구성원의 합의를 위한 커뮤니케이션 수단으로 활용된다. 국내 도시계획 과정에서 독일의 비법정계획과 같은 계획도구의 도입을 통해 참여형 도시계획을 적극적으로 활성화할 필요가 있다.","(Background and Purpose) Citizen participation in the urban planning process is an important element that can reflect citizens' demands in policies through social consensus and minimize conflicts in the implementation process. Citizen participation in the urban planning process is institutionalized through the German Federal Construction Code (BauGB), and local governments with the authority to establish and execute urban planning ensure this through the enactment of ordinances and non-statutory plans. In other words, the process of creating a city through wide-ranging citizen participation is systematized, from the initial idea of the city's development direction to the establishment and implementation of a specific development plan. Therefore, through research on non-statutory planning in Germany, we aim to improve understanding of participatory urban planning and derive urban planning implications and domestic application measures. (Method) Through a review of prior research, trends in prior research related to non-statutory planning and participatory urban planning are identified. We examine the relationships between plans established during the urban planning process in Germany. The participatory urban planning case study covers ‘Urbane Mitte’, a case of urban development on a railway site in Berlin, Germany, and ‘Siemens Stadt 2.0’, a case of urban development on an industrial site. In addition, we analyze the urban development case of “K-2 Sky City” for the development of the K-2 former site in Daegu, Korea. Analyze the characteristics of planning through the use of German non-statutory planning, especially the differences between domestic and foreign urban planning from the perspective of citizen participatory planning. (Results) In the case of German urban development related to participatory urban planning, it was found that an institutional mechanism exists to guarantee broad citizen participation in the entire project process through non-statutory planning. In addition, their role and authority are significant, going beyond simply presenting opinions during the planning process and participating in the drafting of plans or even participating in the judging of contests. In other words, it can be understood as not only systematic support at the public level for citizen participation, but also citizens actively participating and making efforts to develop and develop their regions. In the domestic case, although it is still a large-scale development project that has a significant impact on the development of the city, citizen participation is very limited, and top-down planning and development is led by the public. (Conclusions) Germany's non-statutory planning is characterized by three-dimensional and spatial design of the city's future and the creation of diverse and flexible alternative plans through flexible planning. In addition, in this process, various stakeholders jointly participate through transparent procedures to create a plan, which is used as a means of communication to reach consensus among members of society. In the domestic urban planning process, there is a need to actively promote participatory urban planning through the introduction of planning tools such as Germany's non-statutory planning."

Despite the increasing social role and importance of NPOs, the accounting system and accounting environment have not been able to properly support them and voices for improvement have been raised. The Ministry of Economy and Finance enacted the PSCAS in 2018 to meet social needs. In the field of for － profit organizations, empirical studies on the impact of the introduction of Korean International Financial Reporting Standards(K－IFRS) on the accounting environment and system have been actively conducted from various angles, whereas related nonprofit studies have hardly been conducted in Korea.[Methodology] To conduct empirical analyses, this study collected the data of NPOs from 2015 to 2020 in Korea Guide Star and the National Tax Service disclosure system and performed a multivariate regression analysis.[Findings] From the empirical analyses, first, the results show that the financial reporting quality changes with the introduction of PSCAS and the empirical analyses of dividing data by public service type also show the same results. These results mean that the accounting system and accounting information are closely related. Second, the results show that individual donations increase after the introduction of PSCAS but there is no significant change in corporate donations or total donations. These mean that there is a difference between individual and corporate donations according to the introduction of PSCAS.[Implications] This study can provide empirical evidence to policy makers and disclosure supervisory authorities for the introduction of PSCAS. It also can provide good implications for future empirical research on the accounting environment for NPOs and donations by donor type."

Additionally, there was no statistically significant correlation between intelligence with parenting characteristics.Conclusion : This study has significance in objectively evaluating the parenting characteristics of parents of children aged 6–7 years with ADHD by measuring the children's intelligence and parental characteristics using standardized assessment tools. The lack of correlation between intelligence and parenting characteristics suggests that factors more complex than a child’s intelligence are associated with parenting characteristics. This underscores the need for further research on parenting characteristics involving children aged 6–7 years with ADHD and their parents."
초기불교 부파 전적에 나타난 사띠 개념,2024,"['사띠', '기억', '부파', '아비달마', '상좌부', '설일체유부', 'sati', 'memory', 'Buddhist sects', 'abhidharma', 'Theravāda', 'Sarvâstivāda']","사띠(念, sati / smṛti)는 사마타 위빠사나 등의 중심 개념으로 나타난다. 현재 국내외에서 사띠의 정의와 개념은 혼재되어 사용된다. 또한 현대 불교학은 사띠를 원래 의미인 기억(memory)으로 정의하는 데 주저하거나 회피하는 경향이 있다. 이 때문에 사띠의 역어는 영어권에서 mindfulness 가 주로 사용된다. 국내에서는 mindfulness나 awareness의 번역어로 마음챙김이나 알아차림 등의 다양한 용어가 사용된다. 이처럼 사띠는 전통적인 정의와 의미와는 다른 역어로 사용된다.그렇다면 초기 부파불교 소속의 여러 경전과 제논서에서 사띠는 어떠한 정의와 개념으로 나타나는가? 현존하는 초기 부파불교의 경전과 논서는 상좌부, 설일체유부, 법장부, 음광부 등이 있다. 결론적으로 부파 소전의 모든 경장에서 사띠는 모두 기억의 의미로 사용된다는 점이 확인된다. 마찬가지로 제부파의 제논서에서도 사띠는 기본적으로 기억을 의미하는 것으로 나타난다. 제부파의 경전이나 논서에서 사띠는 기억 이외의 다른 의미로 사용되는 경우를 찾아볼 수 없다. 부파를 초월하여 모든 경론에서 사띠는 ‘기억’, 즉 과거에 지었던 행위와 말을 기억하는 것으로 정의하고 있다. 이는 제부파의 경장과 제부파의 논서에서도 변함없이 기억으로 정의하고 있음이 확인된다. 이러한 종합적인 탐구의 결론은 불교수행에서 기억 문제를 놓치고 있는 점을 비판적으로 검토해 봐야 한다는 점이다. 이러한 점에서 본 연구는 다시 기억을 중심으로 사띠에 대한 새로운 후속 연구 과제를 부과하고 있다.","In Early Buddhist Schools in India, sati(念, sk. smṛti) appears as the central concept of samatha-vipassana. Currently, the definition and concept of sati are used various terms both at home and abroad. Additionally, current Buddhist Studies tend to hesitate or avoid defining sati as its original meaning of memory. For this reason, the translation of sati is mindfulness, which is mainly used in English-speaking countries. In Korea, various terms such as ‘maeumchaenggim’ or ‘alachalim’ are used as translations of mindfulness or awareness. In this way, sati is used as a translation that differs from its traditional definition and meaning.So, what definition and concept does sati appear in the early canonical texts of various Buddhist schools and various treatises of the Abhidhamma works? The early canonical texts of various Buddhist schools and the Abhidhamma works that exist include Theravāda, Sarvâstivāda, Dharmaguptaka, Kāśyapīya and Mahāsāṁghika. In conclusion, it is confirmed that sati is used in the meaning of memory in all canonical texts of Buddhist schools. Likewise, in the Abhidhamma works of all Buddhist schools, sati appears basically to mean memory.In the canonical texts of all Buddhist schools and the Abhidhamma works, sati cannot be found used in any other sense than memory. In all canonical texts and the Abhidhamma works of various Buddhist schools, sati is defined as ‘memory’, that is, remembering past actions and words. This is confirmed to be consistently defined as memory in the canonical texts of all Buddhist schools and in the treatises of all Buddhist schools. The conclusion of this comprehensive investigation is that we must critically examine what is missing from memory issues in Buddhist practice. In this respect, this study suggests that sati should be studied again with a focus on memory in the future."
몸과 마음에 대한 불교적 논의에서 등장하는 요가끄셰마(yogakṣema) 용례 검토,2024,"['yogakṣema', 'yogakkhema', 'anying (安危)', 'anwei (安隱)', 'Yogācāra', '요가끄셰마', '요가케마', '안위', '안은', '유가행파']","본 논문은 먼저 인도 불교문헌에서 사용되는 용어 요가끄셰마(yogakṣe-ma, 팔리어: 요가케마 yogakkhema)에 대한 기존 연구를 검토하였다. 그리고 『해심밀경』과 『유가사지론』의 용례를 추가적으로 검토하여 보다 확장된 논의를 시도하였다.노먼은 팔리어 경전에서 요가케마가 열반과 관련되어 사용될 때 땃뿌루샤(tatpuruṣa)로 해석해야 함을 지적하면서, 이런 해석은 기존 베다 문헌의 드반드바(dvandva) 용례를 변형한 것이라고 추정하였다. 폰틸로와 네리의 연구는 노먼의 추정을 수정 및 구체화할 기반을 마련하였다. 그들은 베다 문헌에서 요가끄셰마를 땃뿌루샤로 해석할 수 있는 구절을 확인하였고, 이를 통해 요가끄셰마를 땃뿌루샤로 해석하는 방식이 불교만의 것이 아님을 보여주었다. 그들의 연구를 통해서 팔리어의 요가케마 용례에서 불교가 변형한 부분은 요가케마를 열반의 동의어로 사용한 점에 한정된다는 점을 확인할 수 있다.한편, 『해심밀경』과 『유가사지론』에는 요가끄셰마를 열반의 동의어로 사용하는 용례 외에, 몸과 마음의 밀접한 관계를 서술하기 위해 드반드바(dvandva) 복합어로 사용하는 구절이 등장한다. 이와 유사한 용례가 『아르타샤스트라』에서 발견된다. 거기에서 두 주체가 밀접한 관계가 있음을 표현하기 위해서 요가끄셰마가 사용된다. 『해심밀경』과 『유가사지론』의 독창성은 몸과 마음이라는 특정한 두 주체의 밀접한 관계를 표현하였다는 점이다. 폰틸로와 네리의 연구와 유사하게, 『해심밀경』과 『유가사지론』에서 사용된 요가끄셰마 용례 분석은 불교 고유의 용어가 상당 부분 다른 인도 문헌과 의미를 공유하고 있다는 점을 보여준다. 그리고 이런 공유점을 확인했을 때, 불교 용어의 독창성이 어디에 있는지 정확하게 이해할 수 있다는 점도 보여준다.","This paper aims to explore the meaning of yogakṣema in the Buddhist literature. Previous studies about yogakkhema (skt. yogakṣema) in the Pāli Buddhist literature shed light on the Buddhist adaptation of Vedic terms. On the basis of these studies, I analyse the usage of this term in the Yogācārabhūmi (YoBh) and the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra (Saṃdhi) to examine the Buddhist usage in a broader context.Kenneth R. Norman points out that the Pāli term yogakkhema should be interpreted as a tatpuruṣa compound (khema from yoga) when used in relation to nibbāna (skt. nirvāṇa). Norman regards this Buddhist usage as an adaptation of the Vedic term, because the Vedic term yogakṣema should be interpreted as a dvandva compound (yoga and kṣema). Tiziana Pontillo and Chiara Neri modify Norman’s hypothesis, with their research showing that the interpretation of yogakṣema as a tatpuruṣa compound could be found in the Vedic literature and that, moreover, some Vedic texts use the term yogakṣema in relation to śreyas (“good”). According to their research, therefore, the Buddhist change is limited to using the tatpuruṣa compound yogakṣema, which already existed in the Vedic literature, in relation to nirvāṇa.Examining the YoBh and the Saṃdhi enriches the discussion of the Buddhist usage of yogakṣema. This paper shows that these texts use yogakṣema not only in relation to nirvāṇa but also to describe the close relationship between mind and body. In a passage of the YoBh, the mind indicates the store-consciousness (ālayavijñāna) and the body indicates a kind of embryo (kalalarūpa); these two agents are further described as sharing benefit (anugraha) and damage (upaghāta). This close relationship is expressed as anyonyayogakṣema (“sharing yoga and kṣema”), in which yogakṣema should be understood as a dvandva compound. Xuanzang’s (玄奘) Chinese translation of the YoBh and the Saṃdhi proves that these two meanings of yogakṣema were known and transmitted to Buddhists at least until 7 CE.Finally, the analysis is expanded by considering the Arthaśāstra, where the close relationship between two agents is expressed by the term tulyayogakṣema (“having the same yogakṣema”). The comparison between the Yogācāra literature and the Arthaśāstra demonstrates that the Yogācāra usage of yogakṣema in the compound anyonyayogakṣema is not unusual. The Yogācāra indeed changed the meaning, but the change was limited to specifying the two agents as mind and body."
『니까야』를 통해 본 세친의 십이연기,2024,"['세친', '연기', '십이연기', '분위연기설', '찰나연기설', '식상속', '아비달마구사론', 'Vasubandhu', 'Conditioned Co-arising', 'Twelve Links of Conditioned Co-arising', 'Conditioned Co-arising in (twelve) States', 'The Doctrine of Momentariness', 'Consciousness-Stream', 'Abhidharmakośabhāṣya']",,"This study is based on Vasubandhu's unique explanation of Twelve links of the conditioned co-arising(pratītyasamutpāda) in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya through the comparison with Nikāya. The interpretation of Vasubandhu in previous studies was regarded as similar to the interpretation of ‘Momentariness theory’ or 'Three Realms and Two Causes and Effects' at abhidharma buddhism. But Vasubandhu criticizes the interpretations of abhidharma and presents the interpretation of the bondage (abhisaṃbandha, or 繫縛) as an alternative. Since ordinary persons that had a thinking of Ātman or ‘I am’ did not recognize that the existence formed in the structure of consciousness is the heritage of conditioned co-arising(緣已生, pratītyasamutpanna) and formations(saṅkhārā), for the sake of pleasure and non-suffering (non-suffering), they did actions performed by body, speech, or mind and was linked to the 'stream of consciousness'(vijñāna-saṃtāna) and the ‘activity of consciousness’ (vijñānākrānti) into one’s the pursuit of existence. This study tracked back traces of the interpretation of Vasubandhu at Nikāya. The overlap of pratītyasamutpanna and saṅkhārā is related to Bhūmija-sutta, which explains the structure in which past experiences influence present experience. The pursuit of the existence as the concept of middle existence, which shows the connection between the previous existence(bhūta) and the Re-existence (punabbhava) is related to the Moḷiyaphagguna-sutta. The overlap of 'from saṅkhārā to salāyatana' and ‘six visaya and six consciousness’ is compared to Bālapaṇḍita-sutta. Vasubandhu's explanation of the part from upādāna to maraṇa is related to the explanation that consciousness, arising from the conditions of four kinds of nutriments and formations, leads to re-existence in the Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya sutta and Atthirāga-sutta. In the Anusaya-sutta, the views of ahaṅkāra, mamaṅkāra and māna were embedded in latent tendency of kāya as embodied of consciousness. In conclusion, Vasubandhu's interpretation of pratītyasamutpāda as seen through Nikāyas reveals the true meaning of it as an explanation of the inability to escape the structure of pain because of binding to the consciousness of the pursuit of existence."
"무(無)의 역량으로서 이미지 - 배용균의 <달마가 동쪽으로 간 까닭은?>, <검으나 땅에 희나 백성>을 중심으로",2024,"['배용균', '무(無)', '실존주의', '외화면', '탈중심', 'Bae Yongkyun', 'Nothingness', 'Existentialism', 'Off-screen', 'Decentralization']","본 연구는 한국 영화사상 가장 도전적이고 창의적인 감독으로 평가받는 배용균의 작품에 관한 연구다. 비내러티브성이 강조된 배용균의 두 작품 <달마가 동쪽으로 간 까닭은?>과 <검으나 땅에 희나 백성>에서 영화 이미지들은 인물의 행동과 대사에 크게 기대지 않은 채 스크린에 부유하는 신비롭고 경이로운 어떤 것처럼 보인다. 배용균의 작품세계가 구성하는 모호한 시각 이미지와 정교한 청각 이미지 그리고 선문답처럼 던져지는 대사의 함축성 등은 무매개적으로 접합되며 새로운 의미를 생성한다. 이 이미지들을 단순히 명상적으로 깊이 있고 뛰어난 시적 아름다움을 제시한다는 관점으로만 논하기에는 부족한 지점이 있어 보인다. 명확한 의미를 파악하기 어려운 선문답의 세계와 같이, 배용균의 영화 이미지들은 그것이 보여주는 인물과 자연에 명확한 형상을 부여하기보단 질료를 드러내는 방식으로 다가가기에 이를 본 연구자는 ‘무(無)의 역량’으로서 이미지라는 관점에서 분석하고자 한다. 미완이자 불확실성이라는 예외적 성격을 띠는 배용균의 영화 이미지는 내러티브 측면에서 벗어나 영화라는 매체와 그것이 보여주는 불확정적인 이미지를 통해 영화를 보는 나 자신에 대한 성찰을 요구한다. 본 연구는 본래적 실존을 중시한 실존주의자들이 주창한 ‘무(無)’ 개념을 전유해 배용균의 작품을 더욱 분명히 이해하는 것을 목표로 한다. 실존주의자들에게 있어 ‘무’란, 비(非)존재 혹은 공허한 것으로 파악되는 것을 넘어서서 존재를 위한 불안 개념으로 자주 설명된다. 본래적 실존이라는 것은 ‘무’를 통한 불안과 자유에 의해 주체성을 확립해 나가는 동시에 자기 자신을 자각하는 데, 바로 이 지점이 배용균의 영화 이미지와 공명하는 점이라 할 수 있다. 따라서 본 연구는 배용균의 두 작품에서 공통적으로 감지되는 탈중심적 시간으로서의 몽타주, 불안 영역으로서의 외화면이 ‘무의 역량’으로 작동해 영화를 사유하는 이미지로 확장하는 사태를 깊이 있게 탐구하는 것을 목표로 한다.","This study examines the work of Bae Yongkyun, who is regarded as one of the most challenging and creative directors in Korean cinema. In Bae's two highly non-narrative films, <Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?> and <The People In White>, the cinematic images seem to be something mysterious and wondrous, floating on the screen without much reliance on the actions and dialogues of the characters. The ambiguous visual images, elaborate auditory images, and the implications of the dialogues, which are thrown around like Zen Kōan, are interwoven and generate new meanings. There is a point at which it is not enough to discuss these images simply in terms of their meditative depth and outstanding poetic beauty. Like the world of Zen Kōan, where it is difficult to grasp a clear meaning, Bae's cinematic images approach the people and nature they show in a way that reveals their texture rather than giving them a clear shape, so this researcher would like to analyze them from the perspective of the image as a 'ability of nothingness'. Bae's cinematic images, with their exceptional character of incompleteness and uncertainty, call for a reflection on the viewer's own self through the medium of film and the indeterminate images it presents, away from the narrative aspect. This study aims to understand Bae's work more clearly by appropriating the concept of 'nothingness' advocated by existentialists who emphasized existence in nature. For existentialists, 'nothingness' is often described as a concept of anxiety for existence beyond what is identified as non-being or emptiness. The original existence is able to recognize itself by establishing subjectivity through anxiety and freedom through 'nothingness', and this is the point that resonates with Bae Yongkyun's film images. Therefore, this study aims to explore in depth the situation in which montage as a decentered time and exteriority as a zone of anxiety, which are common to Bae's two works, operate as a 'capacity of nothingness' and expand the film into a contemplative image."
「答宋伯純」 및 「藏淸軒記」를 통해 본 중재자 金昌翕-兩宋 가문 간의 갈등에 관하여-,2024,"['김창흡', '중재자', '양송 가문', '불화', '노론 단합.', ""Kim Ch'anghŭp"", 'Mediator', 'Yangsong Families', 'Conflict', 'Noron Unity.']","본고는 ｢答宋伯純｣과 ｢藏淸軒記｣를 대상으로 兩宋 가문 간의 갈등을 살펴봄으로써 仲裁者 金昌翕의 면모를 조명하는 데 목적이 있다. 이러한 고찰을 시도하는 이유는, 정치적ㆍ사회적 인간인 김창흡을 부각하기 위해서이다.양송 가문 불화의 불씨는 1703년 여름에 權尙夏의 문인인 申愈가 초고한 師門 辨誣疏에 등장한 “宋浚吉이 놀랍게 여기고 한탄했다는 것이 宋時烈에게 무슨 상관입니까”라는 내용에서 비롯되었다. 양송 가문의 후손들 사이에서 불화가 벌어지게 된 이유는 바로 이 말에 대한 서로 다른 해석 때문이었다. 송시열 측 인물 신유는 송준길이 당대에 강한 권세를 갖고 있던 李景奭을 두려워하여 그에게 순종했기 때문에 그렇게 말했다고 해석하였고, 宋夏績을 비롯한 송준길 문인들은 송준길의 그 말에 대해 시국을 걱정해서 한 이야기였을 뿐이지, 이경석에게 치우치려는 것이 절대 아니었다고 주장하였다. 따라서 그들은 사문을 위해서 1703년 하반기부터 1705년까지 통문을 보내 상대방을 토벌하려고 했다. 결국은 1705년 7월 이후 송시열의 증손 宋一源이 검담서원에서 유벌을 입고 말았다. 그 뒤에도 양송 가문 간의 싸움이 계속해서 진행되고 있었다. 이렇게 해서 양송 가문의 관계는 원점으로 돌아갈 수 없게 되어 버렸다.양송 가문과 밀접한 혼척 관계에 있던 김창흡은 이 일을 계속해서 지켜보고 있었다. 양송 가문의 불화를 조정하기 위해 김창흡은 이 다툼에 앞장선 인물인 송일원과 송하적에게 각각 편지와 기문을 보냈다. 두 글에서 김창흡은 그들이 은진송씨 가문의 후손이며 兩先生의 전통을 잘 이어받았다는 점을 강조함으로써 師門是非를 따지지 말고 ‘時義’를 잘 판단하여 ‘顯晦語默’의 도를 지키면서 마음을 수양하라고 권유하였다. 김창흡이 양송 가문의 불화를 중재한 심층적 의도는 노소론 간 공방전이 치열하던 18세기 초의 정국 속에서 유리한 국면을 차지하기 위해 노론 내부의 단합을 도모하려던 것이었다.이 사건의 전말을 구체적으로 재구성하고 이에 대한 김창흡의 반응을 조명하는 것은 본고에서 처음 시도하는 작업이다. 이는 김창흡과 그를 둘러싼 역사적 맥락에 대한 이해를 진전시키는 데 기여할 수 있을 것으로 기대된다.","The purpose of this paper is to illuminate the role of mediator Kim Ch'anghŭp by examining the conflict between Yangsong families through the analysis of Reply to Song Paeksun and Changch'ŏnghŏn'gi. The aim of such examination is to highlight the political and social figure of Kim Ch'anghŭp.The seeds of discord between Yangsong families were sown in the summer of 1703 with the publication of the “Master-Disciple Clarification Memorial” written by Kwŏn Sangha's scholars Sin Yu which contained the phrase, “What does it matter to Song Siyŏl even Song Chunkil is surprised and lamented?” The divergence of interpretation among the descendants of Yangsong families stemmed directly from this statement. Sin Yu, a figure on the Song Siyŏl side, interpreted that Song Chunkil obeyed Yi Kyŏngsŏk, who held significant influence at the time, out of fear.while Song Chunkil's scholars, including Song Hachŏk, argued that Song Chunkil's words were merely expressing concerns about the current situation and were by no means intended to cater to Yi Kyŏngsŏk. Consequently, they exchanged letters from the latter half of 1703 to 1705 to criticize each other. Eventually, after July 1705, Song Siyŏl's descendant, Song Ilwŏn, was discredited at the Kŏmdamsŏwŏn. And thus, the relationship between Yangsong families irreversibly deteriorated.Kim Ch'anghŭp, closely associated with Yangsong families, closely monitored this dispute. In order to mediate the discord between Yangsong families, Kim Ch'anghŭp sent letters and writings to Song Ilwŏn and Song Hachŏk, the leading figures in the dispute. In these writings, Kim Ch'anghŭp emphasized their lineage as descendants of the Ŭnjinsongssi clan and heirs to the tradition of Yangsŏnsaeng, urging them to cultivate their minds while judging “Shiŭi” well without engaging in contentious arguments. Kim Ch'anghŭp's deep intention in mediating the discord between Yangsong families was to promote internal unity within the Noron faction amidst the fierce political landscape of the early 18th century.Reconstructing the entire story of this incident in detail and shedding light on Kim Ch'anghŭp's response is a novel endeavor in this paper. It is anticipated that this will contribute to advancing understanding of Kim Ch'anghŭp and the historical context surrounding him."

However, it should be taken into account that actively guaranteeing the right to assist lawyers at the beginning of the investigation can directly affect the judgment of prosecution. Furthermore, it is expected that public defenders will be able to play a role as a monitoring organization that monitors violations of due process and human rights violations by investigative agencies.Looking at foreign legislation, it was confirmed that in the case of the U. K. and the United States, the right to receive assistance from criminal public lawyers is guaranteed from the time the police appear or the suspect is summoned, which is the early stage of the investigation. The public defender of the suspect positively reviewed the establishment of a public defender system in that the suspect can be preemptively guaranteed the right to defend by early introduction of a lawyer, thereby guaranteeing the principle of a weapon, and that the criminal public defender can even take charge of the function of public monitoring of judicial institutions.As for the possibility of its introduction, a step-by-step and selective introduction plan is proposed. Therefore, it should be expanded to the arrested suspects and introduced first to specific socially underprivileged. In addition, in the case of introducing a preliminary interrogation system for seizure and search warrants, it was necessary to introduce a public defender of the suspect in that it functions the same as the actual examination of the warrant before the suspect's arrest.Regarding the operation plan of the public defender system, we looked at the unification of the operation of public defenders for suspects and defendants, the efficiency of the actual operation if the management entity of the public defender is the court, and the operation of the public defender evaluation system for suspects and defendants to ensure the quality of public defense.In order for the public defender system to be established as a system to guarantee the right to participate in the judiciary for the vulnerable, it must be introduced not only to the accused but also to the suspect. However, there is still controversy over the method and timing. Here, it is argued that a positive review of such a plan is necessary. In addition, the review in this paper could have meaning as a concrete plan for introducing the system."

In Chapter 2, the author looked at the life of Ryuyŏngmo and the context of the transmission of his ideas. Chapter 3 sheds light on Dasŏk's Communication(會通) ideology by dividing it into four themes: “Friendship between father and son,” “View of God,” “Theory of the Holy Spirit,” and “Saram(사람).” Dasŏk's idea of ""Affection between Father and Son(父子有親)"" reinterpreted the Confucian idea of ""Serving Heaven(事天)"" from a Christian perspective. It can be derived from this that it evokes the original Confucian belief in ""Serving Heaven"" and at the same time injects the Christian relationship between God and man into the Confucian tradition of ""Serving Parents(事親)"". Dasŏk reinterpreted the Christian view of God through the ideas of Taekŭk(太極), Emptiness(虛空), and Nothing(無) that are common to Confucianism and Taoism in Eastern thought. Moreover, he named God ""Mukŭk and Taekŭk(無極而太極)"", deriving a new explanation. The introduction of the so-called ""Mukŭk and Taekŭk"" thought provides a clue that his thoughts can move from the view of one God to multiple truths. The idea of translating the Holy Spirit as ""ŏlkim(얼김)"" opened up new areas of Eastern theology. He drew closer to Mencius' theory of Qi(氣), introduced traditional Korean spiritual thought ""ŏl(얼)"", and rebuilt the Christian theory of the Holy Spirit.

The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which planned and led the uprising, also held a memorial service. Government-affiliated organizations did not forget and paid tribute to Lee Bong-chang's death, and informed the Korean community of the value and historical significance of the uprising. Memorial events were also held in the Americas. The commemorative event was promoted around the Korean National Association(大韓人國民會). In Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Central America in the United States, a grand memorial service was held to praise the meaning and noble sacrifice of the uprising.After liberation, commemorative programs and prefectural projects began to be promoted. Kim Gu(金九), the president of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, recovered the bodies of Yoon Bong-gil(尹奉吉) and Baek Jeong-gi(白貞基), including Lee Bong-chang, and returned them to Korea. Since then, the commemorative project related to Lee Bong-chang has not been carried out properly. An official memorial service was held on October 10, 1976. The reason why the memorial service, which had been out of interest so far, was suddenly promoted seems to have been part of the establishment of a ‘Yushin(維新) regime’ based on national unification and a strong control system.The commemorative service and memorial projects began to be systematically and continuously promoted with the formation of the Lee Bong-chang Memorial Project Association. Organized in 1977, the Memorial Association held commemorative events on January 8 and October 10 every year, while promoting various projects such as the construction of statues and memorials. Academic projects have also begun. Academic projects were carried out by individuals and organizations such as individual researchers, Lee Bong-chang Memorial Project, and universities. Dankook University held academic conferences in 2000 and 2001, respectively, and published research books combining the research results of the 2002 academic conference. In addition, a large number of records related to the Lee Bong-chang trial, which were held in Japan's Highest Court, were collected, translated, and published a collection of data in 2004.As such, Lee Bong-chang is not receiving the honorable ‘reward(mentalit y)’ from the state and the people. Independence movements are often unsucc essful rather than accomplishing their objectives. It should be avoided to thin k that the failure to punish the targeted king of Japan was 'failed' or of less h istorical value."

In the case of tomatoes, image color was examined to assess ripeness, while support vector machine (SVM) and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) methods effectively identified ripe tomatoes. For sweet pepper, we visualized the color distribution and used the Gaussian mixture model for clustering to analyze its post-harvest color characteristics. For the quality assessment of netted melons, the LAB (lightness, a, b) color space, binary images, and depth mapping were used to measure the net patterns of the melon. In addition, a combination of depth and color data proved successful in identifying flowers of different sizes and distances in cucumber greenhouses. This study highlights the effectiveness of these computer vision strategies in monitoring the growth and development, ripening, and quality assessment of fruits and vegetables. For broader applications in agriculture, future researchers and developers should enhance these techniques with plant physiological indicators to promote their adoption in both research and practical agricultural settings."

The ability to hear was developed, and the ears heard the teachings. Also, if the meaning of this is defined according to the understanding of the Yogācāra School, it becomes ‘a statement about what appears in Ananda’s perception when the linguistic representation that occurred in the Buddha’s perception changes similarly.’According to Won-chk, ‘onetime(一時)’ is related to the fulfillment of time(時成就), and its meaning goes beyond the physical level. In other words, it is related to the overall situation from the appearance of Tathagata in the world to the beginning and end of Buddhist teachings.According to Won-chk, ‘Buddha(佛)’ is related to the fulfillment of stay(住時就), and the discrepancy in the name of the preacher that appears in Chinese Buddhist sutras is not a problem in the Indian original text or at the original language level. It is a problem that arose during the translation process and has nothing to do with the orthodoxy of the doctrine."

We compared AL, flat K, steep K, mean K, and spherical equivalent (SE) measured by Myopia Master, Lenstar, and KR-1. We utilized a paired t-test and RM-ANOVA to compare mean differences and used Bland–Altman plots, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and Pearson correlation tests for agreement analysis.Results: The mean ALs (mm) measured with Myopia Master and Lenstar were 24.59 ± 0.91 mm and 24.60 ± 0.91 mm, respectively, with no statistical differences (p = 0.085). Both the ICC and Pearson correlation coefficient were 0.999. The mean SEs (D) measured with Myopia Master and KR-1 were -3.32 ± 1.75 D and -3.18 ± 1.68 D, respectively, with significant differences (p < 0.001).

The study method he proposed allows for gradual improvement in order with the goal of learning for the sake of self-improvement(爲己之學), the study of the sage man. Based on The Mean(中庸), he designed a study theory that could lead to knowledge exploration into practice. Because he limited the scope of knowledge exploration to the everyday norms and principles of human relationships, the learning content does not go beyond the scope of elementary learning such as scattering, sweeping, and question-and-answer. The learning theory he proposed was designed to help people reach the highest level through the practice of everyday norms. Therefore, the reason he emphasized the practice of everyday norms was because it was a way to reach the highest level, not because the purpose was to practice the norms themselves.He argued that before starting learning, efforts are needed to establish moral commitment and change bad habits and attitudes. The learning process he proposed was through knowledge exploration and practice. Because he believed that a thorough search for knowledge is fundamental to practice, he was convinced that the pursuit of knowledge through reading precedes practice. The Wihak(爲學) section of the Hahak chinam commercial volume arranged chapters according to this learning order, and the Simsul(心術) section deepened the contents of the Wihak section. Therefore, the order of sections and chapters in this book is the order of learning. He stated that what is needed in the entire process of learning is an attitude of Kyŏng(敬), and that the final destination of study is the highest level of Sŏng(誠). The learning theory of Neo-Confucianism justified the norm on a metaphysical basis. But An Chŏngpok secured the rationale and norms of learning theory only within the the scope of everyday life. So he proposed a simple way of studying that was true to the original meaning of Confucianism, but also allowed you to reflect on yourself and your surroundings. This is the subject of this book: ""Hahak(下學)"" as the right way to study. Because of this, Hahak chinam is a book with a completely different from the Primary Learning(小學)."

To classify maturity stage, CIE L*a*b* values of oriental melon were used in cluster analysis. As a result, the maturity level was divided into three stages and used as reference for maturity classification model of oriental melons. We developed a maturity stage classification model using HSI data applied with single and multiple combination of five pre-processing methods. We provided effective band selection results for hyperspectral data depending on the combination of pre-processing methods.Logistic Lasso model with Savitzky-Golay Smoothing (SG) and Savitzky-Golay Smoothing (SG) + Savitzky-Golay second order derivatives (SG-D2) achieved an accuracy of 0.87 in classifying maturity levels of oriental melons.Therefore, Logistic Lasso model using HSI could be applied for estimating harvesting time for oriental melons cultivated in a hydroponic greenhouse."

The current seat-reservation systems in library reading rooms do not account for these differences, leading to dissatisfaction among users. A survey of 149 library patrons at K University found that 73% were dissatisfied with the thermal conditions in the library. In this study, we developed a Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) virtual sensor system to provide the important thermal-comfort information required for ensuring optimal seat reservation. Using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, we developed PMV virtual sensors for all seats in the library while measuring the temperature and humidity across the room; a total of 45 models were constructed, with the Coefficient of Variation of the Root-Mean-Square error (cv(RMSE)) being less than 10%. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations provided the airflow data; the data were incorporated into the PMV calculations. Based on this, the PMV was visualized within an actual seat reservation system to identify and recommend optimal seating, reducing user dissatisfaction by up to 41.7%. This study indicates that providing PMV-based thermal comfort information during seat reservation can effectively reduce occupant dissatisfaction, which in turn can help minimize unnecessary heating and cooling demands and contribute to building energy optimization."
반야바라밀(Prajñāpāramitā)은 멸진정(Nirodhasamāpatti)인가?,2024,"['반야바라밀(般若波羅蜜)', '멸진정(滅盡定)', '상수멸(想受滅)', '삼해탈문(三解脫門)', '실현[作證]', '『십지경(十地經)』', 'Perfection of wisdom (prajñāpāramitā)', 'Absorption of extinction (Nirodhasamāpatti)', 'Three gates to deliverance (trīṇi vimokṣamukhāni)', 'Cessation of ideation and feeling (Saṃjñāvedayitanirodha)', 'Realization (sākṣātkriyā)', 'Daśabhūmikasūtra']",,"The prajñāpāramitā is often translated as the perfection of wisdom, meaning ‘the highest wisdom.’ There has been an active debate in academic circles as to whether this perfection of wisdom is a kind of wisdom with conceptual understanding or a concentration beyond such understanding. This paper moves away from Prajñāpāramitā texts, which have been the main focus of such studies, and examines the perfection of wisdom in the Daśabhūmikasūtra. This is because there are narratives in the scripture that imply that the perfection of wisdom is the same as the absorption of extinction (nirodhasamāpatti) or the cessation of ideation and feeling (saṃjñāvedayitanirodha).In Chapter II, this paper finds traces of the absorption of extinction in the seventh stage of the Daśabhūmikasūtra, which states that bodhisattvas from the sixth stage (i.e., abhimukhī bhūmiḥ) can “enter into extinction (nirodhaṃ samāpadyate) but do not realize it.” It singles out the ‘dwelling of/in prajñāpāramitā (prajñāpāramitāvihāra) of the sixth stage as a candidate for the absorption of extinction.Chapter III clarifies that, in the context of successive dwellings (anupūrvavihāra), the dwelling of/in prajñāpāramitā equates to the absorption of extinction (nirodhasamāpatti), given the narrative of the third stage (i.e., prabhākārī bhūmiḥ) describes eight dwellings successively except for the nirodhasamāpatti, the culminating point of this succession.In Chapter IV, this paper shows that the ‘realization of extinction (nirodhasākṣātkriyā),’ both in the context of the investigation of the four noble truths and the context of nirodhasamāpatti, results in becoming an arhat who will be free from saṃsara after this life. It, therefore, infers that the statement “he/she does not realize extinction (na nirodhaṃ sākṣātkaroti)” relates to bodhisattvas’ means (upāya) postponing final nirvāṇa until he will have attained all the attributes of the [perfectly enlighted] Buddha(s).Chapter V points out that bodhisattvas’s resolve to “not give up on the sentient beings by not realizing the reality limit” based on great compassion gives rise to the intuitive experience of “dwelling of/in prajñāpāramitā” instead of nirodhasamāpatti. This intuitive experience in the mode of shining light, which can be compared to the experience of the path of vision in mainstream Buddhism, is not the same as the absorption of extinction.Through these steps, this paper suggests that in the Daśabhūmikasūtra, the perfection of wisdom presents itself as concentration and that the author(s) or editor(s) of the Sūtra, keeping in mind the altruism of bodhisattvas, have transformed the nirodhasamāpatti into prajñāpāramitāvihāra, expecting the result of ‘postponing final nirvāṇa’ for the sake of all other beings."

To this end, sentencing procedure must be transparent, accessible, and easily comprehensible to the public. However, laws and regulations on sentencing are diverse and complex. There is a need to integrate laws and regulations on sentencing while facilitating its accessibility so that even those with no legal expertise can easily understand its content and ramifications.In response to these requests, the United Kingdom enacted the Sentencing Act 2020, integrating the content of sentencing procedures woven into various laws into one comprehensive law. After about five years of research and consultation, the U.K. Law Commission drafted the bill of the Sentencing Act 2020 with a total of 416 articles and 28 articles of supplementary provisions. After consulting with experts and the public, gleaning facts and opinions regarding various issues, the Commission released 4 main reports supporting the need for the enactment of the Act. Further, to increase the transparency of efficacy of sentencing, the Commission also adopted a “Clean Sweep” strategy that largely eliminated the effects of the previous sentencing procedure regulations along with the enforcement of the Sentencing Act of 2020. The Sentencing Act 2020 comprehensively includes sentencing issues such as the court's authority on sentencing, detention, and various non-detention means as well as matters related to the classification and treatment of criminals according to age and other factors. It was highly successful in increasing the efficiency of the criminal justice system by organizing and simplifying the sentencing procedure related laws so as to be comprehensible to any lay person.In Korea, laws and regulations on sentencing procedures are also diverse and complex. Furthermore, although it has already been 15 years since the implementation of the sentencing guidelines, a comprehensive law on sentencing procedure has yet to exist. It is high time for Korea to develop an integrated sentencing law like the Sentencing Act 2020 in U.K. The enactment of the Integrated Sentencing Act in Korea by increasing transparency and accessibility will serve to increase public understanding and trust in sentencing procedures while increasing the efficiency of criminal procedure."

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of creating a neovagina using a fresh human amnion in women with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.Methods Ten patients were analyzed retrospectively. Anatomical success was defined by a postoperative vaginal length ≥5 cm, and a width sufficient to comfortably accommodate the insertion of two fingers. Functional success was achieved when a score of >26.5 was attained on the Arabic validated version of the functional sexual function index (FSFI).Results Overall, the mean vaginal length before surgery was 2.15±0.85 cm (range, 1.5-4.5). The mean vaginal length after surgery was 5.5±0.53 cm (range, 5-6), and all patients (n=10) achieved anatomical success. The FSFI score after surgery was 29.2±2.4, and eight patients achieved functional success. The mean operative time and estimated blood loss were 83.5±50.31 minutes (range, 42-210) and 122.0±75.69 mL (range, 20-250), respectively. None of the patients required intraoperative blood transfusion or experienced injury to vital organs. Four patients developed postoperative leukocytosis within 48 hours, and one patient experienced chronic pelvic pain that lasted more than 6 months postoperatively. No major postoperative complications, such as pelvic abscesses, open wounds, chronic vaginal discharge, or reoperation, were reported.Conclusion In conclusion, surgical dissection of the vesicorectal space and utilization of fresh human amnion to create a neovagina over a vaginal mold are technically feasible and safe, and are linked to favorable anatomical and functional outcomes in MRKH patients with vaginal agenesis."

The subjects of the study were 138 teachers from daycare centers located in the K province and D metropolitan area, and their responses were analyzed. The responses of daycare teachers were collected and categorized through a questionnaire asking about metaphorical expressions and the reasons for metaphorical expressions, and the frequencies and percentages according to the categories were calculated. As a result of the study, a total of 97 metaphorical expressions were found for daycare teachers' metaphors for outdoor play experienced in childhood, and they were classified into 6 categories. The conclusions based on the results of analyzing the metaphor types are as follows: First, the outdoor play experienced by the daycare teacher during his childhood was meaningfully remembered as ‘play-time’, with a longing for the past time and a deeply imprinted time; Second, through ‘play-feeling(感)’, they were reminiscing about outdoor play accompanied by positive emotions of play through the emotions and feelings they felt at the time. Third, outdoor play as a ‘play-field’ was recognized as a memory in the spatial aspect of encounters and possibilities. Accordingly, this study is significant in that it examines the meaning of outdoor play through a metaphorical analysis of the outdoor play experienceed by daycare teachers during their childhood, and suggests a direction for outdoor play in current daycare centers through the daycare teacher's reminiscences."

Childhood-related neural genotype–phenotype in ATP1A3 mutations: comprehensive analysis,2024,['ATP1A3 · AHC · Sodium potassium ATPases · CAPOS · Genotype · Phenotype'],,"Background ATP1A3 is a gene that encodes the ATPase Na + /K + transporting subunit alpha-3 isoenzyme that is widely expressed in GABAergic neurons. It maintains metabolic balance and neurotransmitter movement. These pathways are essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. A mutation in the ATP1A3 gene demonstrates remarkable genotype–phenotype heterogeneity.Objectives To provide insight into patients with ATP1A3 mutation.Material and methods These cases were identified using next generation sequencing. The patients' clinical and genetic data were retrieved. Detailed revision of the literature was conducted to illustrate and compare findings. The clinical, genetical, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological data of all pediatric patients were extracted.Results The study included 14 females and 12 males in addition to two novel females cases. Their mean current age is 6.3 ± 4.24 years. There were 11.54% preterm pregnancies with 5 cases reporting pregnancy complications. Mean age of seizure onset was 1.07 ± 1.06 years. Seizure semiology included generalized tonic–clonic, staring spells, tonic–clonic, and others. Levetiracetam was the most frequently used Anti-seizure medication. The three most frequently reported classical symptoms included alternating hemiplegia of childhood (50%), cerebellar ataxia (50%), and optic atrophy (23.08%). Non-classical symptoms included dystonia (73.08%), paroxysmal dyskinesias (34.62%), and encephalopathy (26.92%). Developmental delay was reported among 84.62% in cognitive, 92.31% in sensorimotor, 80.77% in speech, and 76.92% in socioemotional. EEG and MRI were non-specific.Conclusion Our study demonstrated high heterogeneity among patients with pathogenic variants in the ATP1A3 gene. Such variation is multifactorial and can be a predisposition of wide genetic and clinical variables. Many patients shared few similarities in their genetic map including repeatedly reported de novo, heterozygous, mutations in the gene. Clinically, higher females prevalence of atypical presentation was noted. These findings are validated with prior evidence and the comprehensive analysis in this study."

Some Asian countries are using reduced doses label according to the J-ROCKET AF trial. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a high-dose rivaroxaban regimen (HDRR, 20/15 mg) and low-dose rivaroxaban regimen (LDRR, 15/10 mg) among elderly East Asian patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in real-world practice.Methods: This study was a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional observational study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in AF patients > 65 years of age with or without renal impairment.Results: A total of 1,093 patients (mean age, 72.8 ± 5.8 years; 686 [62.9%] men) were included in the analysis, with 493 patients allocated to the HDRR group and 598 patients allocated to the LDRR group. A total of 765 patients received 15 mg of rivaroxaban (203 in the HDRR group and 562 in the LDRR group). There were no significant differences in the incidence rates of major bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% confidential interval [CI], 0.21–1.93), stroke (adjusted HR, 3.21; 95% CI, 0.54–19.03), and composite outcomes (adjusted HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.47–2.69) between the HDRR and LDRR groups.Conclusion: This study revealed the safety and effectiveness of either dose regimen of rivaroxaban in an Asian population for stroke prevention of AF. Considerable numbers of patients are receiving LDRR therapy in real-world practice in Asia. Both regimens were safe and effective for these patients."
Clinical Features and Visual Outcome of Infectious Keratitis Associated with Orthokeratology Lens in Korean Pediatric Patients,2024,"['Contact lens', 'Corneal ulcer', 'Infectious keratitis', 'Orthokeratology', 'Visual outcomes']",,"Purpose: To investigate the clinical features and visual outcome of infectious keratitis associated with orthokeratology (Ortho-K) lens in Korean pediatric patients.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients diagnosed with Ortho-K lens-related infectious keratitis from June 2005 to April 2020 at a tertiary referral hospital. Patients’ demographics, clinical features, microbiological evaluation, and treatment methods were assessed, and factors related to final visual outcomes were analyzed.Results: The study included 26 eyes from 26 patients (19 female and 7 male patients; mean age, 11.9 years), with an average Ortho-K lens wear duration of 33.7 ± 21.2 months. The highest number of cases occurred in summer (11 of 26 cases, 42.3%).Central or paracentral corneal lesions were observed in 25 cases (96.2%), with a mean corneal epithelial defect size of 5.13 mm2. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated organism (n = 5), followed by Serratia marcescens (n = 4). All patients responded to medical treatment without needing surgical intervention. 72% of cases achieved favorable visual outcomes (Snellen best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] >6 / 12), while 8% experienced severe visual impairment (Snellen BCVA ≤6 / 60) due to residual central corneal opacities. Multivariable analysis showed that non-summer seasons (p = 0.043), duration from symptom onset to presentation (p = 0.040), and corneal epithelial defect size (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with final logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution BCVA. Failed autorefraction at presentation due to an Ortho-K-related infectious keratitis lesion was a significant predictor of poor final visual outcome (Snellen BCVA ≤6 / 12; odds ratio, 38.995; p = 0.030).Conclusions: Ortho-K lens-related infectious keratitis can lead to permanent corneal opacities and potentially devastating visual outcomes in children. Delayed time to presentation, large corneal lesions, failure of autorefraction, and non-summer seasons were associated with poorer outcomes. Proper education and early detection would be key to safe use of orthokeratology lenses in pediatric patients."

At present, China has accelerated the storage and utilization of carbon dioxide on a large scale by strengthening its technology independent research and development capabilities and increasing investment in CCUS technology. However, the capture, transport and storage of carbon dioxide in the process of utilization may pose a risk to the environment due to a large number of leaks, and the laws should be enacted to regulate them.

From a long-term perspective, it is necessary to move away from existing mode and enact a CCUS special legislation to effectively promote the development and application of CCUS technologies. Therefore, this study will focus on introducing the CCUS technology research, industrialization policy, technological development level, CCUS legal system and specific regulations in China. And this study will do further research on legal issues and improvement suggestions related to CCUS technology. This study focuses on key legal issues related to CCUS technology research and industrialization, compares and analyzes the legal systems of China and Korea, and identifies their similarities and differences. It then proposes the significance of mutual reference between different systems."

Refractive Predictability between Standard and Total Keratometry during the Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery with Monofocal Intraocular Lens with Enhanced Intermediate Function,2024,"['Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery', 'Keratometry', 'Monofocal intraocular lens with enhanced intermediate function', 'Total keratometry']",,"Purpose: We aimed to compare the accuracy of the intraocular lens (IOL) calculation formula using the standard keratometry (K) and total K (TK) during the femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) with a monofocal IOL with enhanced intermediate function using currently used formulas.Methods: A retrospective review of 125 eyes from 125 patients who had undergone FLACS with implantation of monofocal IOL with enhanced intermediate function was conducted. The predicted refractive power was calculated using an optical biometer (IOLmaster 700) according to the K and TK in the Barrett Universal II, SRK/T, Haigis, and Holladay 2 formulas. Absolute prediction error (APE) obtained from the actual postoperative refractive outcomes and the refractive error predicted in each formula was compared one month after surgery.Results: Mean APE ranged between 0.29 and 0.39 diopters (D) regardless of the calculation formula and the method of measuring corneal curvature. Significant differences were observed in the APE from the four formulas and the two keratometric measurements (p = 0.014). In a total of 125 eyes from 125 patients, the mean APE was lowest with the Barrett Universal II formula. Across all formulas, both the mean APE and the median APE tended to be lower for K than for TK, although there was no significant difference. Approximately 70% to 80% of the patients were included within 0.5 D of the refractive error across all formulas. The percentage of eyes within 0.5 D of APE outcomes was not statistically different between the K and TK data when using each formula.Conclusions: Keratometric measurements considering the poster corneal curvature did not show any additional advantages when implanting the monofocal IOL with enhanced intermediate function during the FLACS."
"Natural radioactivity, mineralogy and hazard assessment of syenogranites (ornamental stones) using a statistical approach",2024,"['Granitic rocks', 'NaI (Tl) detector', 'Radionuclides', 'Radiological hazard', 'Uranophane']",,"The study focused on syenogranite and its altered variety, and specifically monitored the activities of 226Ra, 232Th, and 40K using NaI(Tl) gamma-ray spectroscopy. Syenogranites in the study area in Egypt were investigated to determine their potential use in industries such as ornamental stones and ceramics. The main outcrops in the study area consist of metasediments, metavolcanics, metagabbro, syn-to late-orogenic granites, and postorogenic granites (syenogranites). There are also numerous dikes and veins of various shapes and compositions that have intruded and penetrated all the older rocks in the area. The mean activity (± standard deviation, SD) of these radioelements in the granites is 226Ra (63 ± 71 Bq kg􀀀 1), 232Th (76 ± 170 Bq kg􀀀 1), and 40K (1248 ± 532 Bq kg􀀀 1) were found to be greater than the world average. The radiological hazards are mostly attributed to the γ-rays emitted by granitic rocks. The granites studied in this study deviate from international standards mainly due to the presence of minerals containing radioelements such as zircon, allanite, monazite, sphene titanite, apatite, thorite, samarskite, fergusonite, xenotime, columbite, apatite and fluorite. As a result, granitic rocks are unsuitable for home building"

The regulation is based on the principle of financial-industrial separation and is designed to prevent large conglomerates from forming, maintaining, or exacerbating excessive concentration. This is a regulation that can assume the purpose specific to the MRFTA. The key issues in the K Cube Holdings case, which provided the impetus for this study, were what the purpose of this regulation could be and whether the scope of domestic financial and insurance companies referred to here could be interpreted in a restrictive manner accordingly.In the K Cube Holdings ruling in December 2023, the Seoul High Court presented a groundbreaking legal principle that distinguishes between financial companies that manage other people’s funds and those that manage their own funds. The two main issues in this case are, first, the concept and scope of the financial industry under the MRFTA, and second, the concept and scope of financial companies referred to in the voting rights restriction provisions of the MRFTA. Regarding the second issue, the Seoul High Court held that the financial industry referred to in the voting rights restriction system under Article 25(1) of the MRFTA is narrowly interpreted as meaning only industrial activities that involve managing other people’s funds, i.e., depositors’ funds. This interpretation by the Seoul High Court is in line with the principle of interpretation based on the relationship between the purpose and means of the regulation, and the principle of interpretation considering the relationship between the means of preventing excessive concentration of economic power.In order to apply regulations to realize the principle of financial-industrial separation, it is necessary to distinguish between the financial and non-financial sectors. To this end, it is necessary to draw a boundary based on the negative effects of the combination of industrial and financial capital and to grasp the definition of finance and the characteristics of the financial industry. This study points out the implications of the K Cube Holdings ruling and the normative problems of the regulations governing financial and insurance businesses subject to voting rights restrictions, and proposes legislative improvements."

Mahāpratisarā-dhāraṇī) were recently made known to the world. Originally kept in a gilt-bronze box, the paper sheets are a significant find. There are already several known extant examples of objects or amulets created to embody dhāraṇīs from the Incantation of Wish-Fulfillment dating to the Goryeo period. However, the paper sheets discussed in this article are the first discoveries of material dhāraṇīs to be tentatively dated to the Silla period. Analyses of the two paper sheets, one written in Chinese and the other in Indic script (梵字, Siddhamātṛkā), show that they were made using Dakpaper (Korean Paper). This provides strong evidence that the paper amulets were made in the Silla Kingdom. Unfortunately, there is no other evidence that definitively establishes when the two paper sheets were created. This article presents an argument for dating the newly rediscovered Incantation of Wish-Fulfillment manuscript sheets from the collection of the Gyeongju National Museum to the latter half of the ninth century or periods subsequent. This premise is mainly based on an examination of the Vajra deity (jingang shen) pictured in the center of the sheet written in Siddhamātṛkā script as well as on an analysis of the gilt-bronze box originally containing the manuscript pages.There are several key considerations that support this claim. First, is a matter of the decoration and ornamentation of the gilt-bronze box, which includes the figures of Vajra-pani and Vajra portrayed at the center of the Incantation of Wish-Fulfillment paper sheets as well as the plant designs on the cover and images of generals featured on the four sides of the gilt-bronze box. Second, it is also important to recognize the period during which dhāraṇīs began to be stored in boxes in accordance with Buddhist rituals during the mid to late ninth century. As is well known, amulets containing the Wugou jingguang datuoluonijing (無垢淨光大陀羅尼經, Great spell of unsullied pure light) were discovered in various sites such as the Three-story Stone Pagoda of 706 at Hwangboksa Temple Site, the Five-story Stone Pagoda constructed sometime during the early to mid-eighth century in Nawon-ri, and the Three-story Stone Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple erected in the mid-eighth century. In these examples, the Wugou jingguang datuoluonijing was never stored in a separate container but rather placed in a reliquary alongside sarira without exception. Contrary to this tradition, Buddhist scriptures started to be placed in their own designated containers such as the gilt-bronze box after the latter half of the ninth century. These boxes were always rectangular and constructed separately from the sarira reliquaries. The third and last consideration, is the fact that the Incantation of Wish-Fulfillment was one of many texts that were recorded onto physical amulets during a period when dhāraṇīs were widely popular. According to the story of Bocheon, Haeinsamyogilsangt'apki (Myogilsang Pagoda Document of Haeinsa Temple) from Samguk Yusa (三國遺事, Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms), the Incantation of Wish-Fulfillment was most prevalent towards the late Silla period and afterwards. This does not necessarily mean that the Incantation of Wish-Fulfillment was never circulated throughout the Silla Kingdom during the eighth century. Rather, it is a persuasive indication which reinforces the idea that the Incantation of Wish-Fulfillment was most popular after the ninth century, further solidifying this timeframe as the most probable production period for the two paper sheets discussed throughout this article."

The post-test score of the subjects who participated in the Havruta program were significantly higher than the pre-test scores. In addition, the sub-scales of self-understanding, self-design, self-regulation and emotional utilization, and self-reflection all showed significant improvement. Furthermore, after dividing the participants into two groups using the mean of the pretest as a reference point, the difference between the two groups was tested, and the sub-scales of the pretest scores were significantly higher than the upper group, and the sub-scales were significantly higher in self-understanding, self-design, self-regulation, and emotional utilization except for self-reflection. This finding is significant because it suggests that intrapersonal intelligence, which has been considered an innate ability, can be changed by educational and psychological programs that enhance social interaction, such as Havruta."
Multivariate statistical study on naturally occurring radioactive materials and radiation hazards in lakes around a Chinese petroleum industrial area,2024,"['Surface water', 'Multivariate statistical analysis', 'Radioactivity', 'radiation hazards', 'Petroleum industry']",,"The high-purity germanium gamma-ray spectrometer was used to measure the radioisotope in surface water of lakes in a Chinee petroleum industrial area. 92 samples were collected from surface water of three lakes. Activity concentrations of 232Th, 226Ra and 40K in three lakes were measured, distributed in the range of 101.8–209.4, 192.1–224.9 and 335.0–548.9 mBq/L, respectively. Results were all within the limits of WHO and China. Potential environmental and health risks were assessed by calculating some radiation hazard indicators, radium equivalent index, annual effective dose, excess lifetime cancer risk, absorbed dose rate, external hazard index, internal hazard index, annual gonadal dose equivalent, activity utilization index and representative gamma index, which ranged 0.38–0.54 Bq/L, 0.06–0.08 mSv/y, 0.23 × 10􀀀 3-0.31 × 10􀀀 3, 0.17–0.24 nGy/h, 1.01 × 10􀀀 3-1.46 × 10􀀀 3, 1.55 × 10􀀀 3-2.02 × 10􀀀 3, 1.16–1.66 μSv/y, 3.13 × 10􀀀 3-4.45 × 10􀀀 3 and 2.60 × 10􀀀 3-3.77 × 10􀀀 3. The results were all at acceptable levels, meaning no impact on human health. The relationship between the electrical conductivity of surface water and the activity concentration of 232Th, 226Ra and 40K was evaluated.The electrical conductivity value was 0.241–0.369 mS/cm, showing a significant correlation coefficient between 226Ra and 40K and electrical conductivity.

‘방탄소년단(BTS) 현상’에 대한 한류 보도 연구: 다이너마이트 빌보드 핫100 차트 1위 전후 텍스트 분석,2024,"['방탄소년단 • 다이너마이트 • 언론보도 • 국가주의 • 토픽모델링', 'BTS • Dynamite • Media Report • Nationalism • Topic Modeling']","‘다이너마이트(Dynamite)’로 2020년 빌보드 핫100 차트 1위를 차지하며 한국 가수로는 유례없는 성취를 이룬 방탄소년단(BTS)은 세계적인 팝 아이콘이 되어, 국내외에서 많은 관심을 받고 있다. 국내 언론은 정치적 관점에서 국가주의 프레임으로 한류 보도를 해왔다는 선행연구를 배경으로, 소위 ‘K-pop 국가대표’로 여겨지는 BTS에 대한 보도의 양상은 어떠했는지 확인해 볼 필요성이 높아졌다. 특히나, BTS는 미국에서 반응을 얻기 시작한 이후 국내 위상이 달라진 ‘역수입’ 한류 스타로 평가받고 있기에, 다이너마이트 빌보드 핫 100 1위 전후로 국내 언론의 보도 양상이 어떻게 달라지는지 알아보는 것은 대중문화 연구를 위해 꼭 필요한 일이다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 BTS의 전환기라고 볼수 있는 빌보드 핫100 차트 1위에 대한 최초 보도 날짜인 2020년 8월 30일을 기준으로 BTS에 대한 언론의 반응이 어떻게 변화하였는지 분석하였다. 연구를 위해, BTS가 데뷔한 2013년 6월 13일부터 단체 활동 중단을 선언한 2022년 6월 30일까지 국내 구독 부수 기준 5대 일간지에서 파이썬(Python)프로그램을 이용하여 기사를 수집하였으며, R 프로그램을 통해 토픽분석과 네트워크분석을 진행했다. 연구 결과, 전반기에는 ‘콘서트’와 ‘한류열풍’이 가장 주요 토픽으로, 후반기에는 ‘한국대표’, ‘병역문제’가 가장 주요한 토픽인 것으로 나타나면서, 빌보드 핫100 1위 이후 BTS에 대한 국가주의적 보도가 증가하고 있음이 확인되었다. 한편 네트워크 분석 결과, 전반기에는 ‘한국’의 중심성이 더 강한 반면, 후반기에는 ‘미국’의 중심성이 더 강한 것으로 나타났다. 하지만 ‘세계’와 ‘한국’이라는 두 키워드는 전체 기간 내내 가장 주요한 키워드인 것으로 나타났는데, 이는 국내 언론이 BTS를 한국을 대표하는 글로벌 스타라는 점을 강조하는 국가주의적 모습을 띄고 있음을 보여준다.","BTS, which achieved an unprecedented record as a Korean band by topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2020 with “Dynamite,” has become a global pop icon and is receiving tremendous attention at home and abroad. In particular, since it dominated the Billboard Hot 100 chart with “Dynamite,” which is considered an indicator of global popularity and fame, it is essential for popular culture research to find out how the media coverage changes before and after it. Since the majority of BTS research so far has been limited to fandom research, storytelling strategy research, and Korean Wave research, finding out what topics the media are reporting on BTS provides important resources for estimating the cultural meaning of the band. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed how the media's reactions to BTS have changed on the basis of August 30, 2020, the date of the first report on topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart, which can be seen as a turning point for BTS. For the study, from June 13, 2013, when BTS debuted, to June 30, 2022, when group team activity was announced to be suspended, articles were collected using a Python program from five major daily newspapers based on the number of subscriptions in Korea. Topic analysis and semantic network analysis were performed using the R program. As the results of the study, 'Concert' and 'Korean Wave' were the most important topics in the first half, and 'Korea Representative' and 'Military Service Problem' were the most important topics in the second half. On the other hand, as the results of the network analyses, the degree centrality of 'Korea' was stronger in the first half, while the degree centrality of 'USA' was stronger in the second half. The two keywords 'world' and 'Korea' were found to be the most important keywords throughout the entire period, which means that the domestic media regards BTS as a globalized star, while at the same time emphasizing that the band is a representative of Korea. BTS represents a paradoxical status of a global phenomenon as a Korean band in the Korean media."
"중, 고교 축구선수들의 마인드셋이 회복 탄력성에 미치는 영향: 그릿(grit)의 매개 효과",2024,"['mindset', 'grit', 'resilience', 'football player']",,"This study verified whether grit mediated significantly in the relationship between mindset and resilience targeting middle & high school Football players. To this end, data on 206 local middle and high school Football in G and K provinces were collected and used in the study. The measurement tools used in this study were used after making a questionnaire of mindset, grit, and resilience suitable for the purpose of the study, and using IBM SPSS 26 & PROCESS for SPSS Macro Model 4(Hayes, 2013) to evaluate exploratory factors. The results were derived through analysis, reliability analysis, and mediation effect analysis. First, it was found that the growth index had a positive effect on the continuation of interest and effort and the situational adaptability effort, which are sub-factors of grit, and the fixed mindset had a negative effect. Second, Grit's interest and continuous efforts were found to have a direct effect on the sociality of resilience. However, it did not affect the positivity and control of resilience.In addition, it was found that situational adaptability efforts had a direct and significant effect on both sociality, positivity, and control of resilience. Third, the growth mindset showed a significant indirect effect on resilience through Grit, showing a complete mediating effect. In other words, it means that the growth mindset does not have a direct effect on resilience, but has a significant effect when passing through Grit. Fourth, even a fixed mind set does not directly affect resilience, but when a fixed mind set passes through Grit, it shows an indirect effect on resilience, which is shown to play a complete mediating role."
Comparative evaluation of machine learning techniques in predicting fundamental meteorological factors based on survey data from 1981 to 2021,2024,['Climate change · Climate prediction · Prediction techniques · Machine learning'],,"Predicting the meteorological factors of the climate in the medium and long term is a significant challenge with socio-economic and environmental implications, given its complex and chaotic nature. The current short-term weather predictions the Iraqi meteorological organization offers are less valuable. As a result, this study introduces four machine-learning methods—artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forest (RF), and K nearest neighbors—to forecast six meteorological factors: total precipitation (TPRE), minimum temperature (MINT), maximum temperature (MAXT), relative humidity (RHUM), top-of-atmosphere radiation (TOAR), and wind speed (WIND) up to 1, 3, 6, and 12 months ahead in four Iraqi governorates.Data on these factors from 1981 to 2021 were extracted from the Modern-ERA Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 dataset. The findings indicate that the RF algorithm outperformed other algorithms regarding prediction accuracy, while the SVR algorithm exhibited the least accuracy. Moreover, TPRE had the lowest performance with an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 19.002; conversely, RHUM and WIND showed much better performance with average RMSE values of 7.259 and 0.192 respectively. The highest performance was observed for MINT (MAXT and TOAR prediction with average-RMSE values of 2.346, 2.244, and 5.314, respectively). The present study’s findings will bring significant advantages in safeguarding human lives and property and promoting health, security, and economic prosperity."

Materials used for this research are recorded files, sheets of a week's worth of dictionary apps, and vocabulary search activities on the internet, collected from 11 students majoring in Japanese language at K University in Korea.Results revealed that some students could not search successfully mainly due to the content of the dictionary and their search strategies. The main problems with the dictionary content were insufficient dictionary meanings and example sentences, and no information on how to use synonyms. By contrast, the problems with the learners' search strategies included mistakes in selecting search resources and input words.To solve the problems of the dictionary content, it is necessary to improve the dictionary content and system for learners, which is different from the language dictionary for Japanese general users. To minimize the problem of the learners' search strategies, I believe it is necessary to guide the dictionary search strategy in the field of Japanese language education. More specifically, it is encouraged to include from the internet various learners' dictionaries and learning blogs about how to search efficiently, i.e. use which words, expressions search resources for the purpose of search."
Randomized controlled trial of the effect of general anesthetics on postoperative recovery after minimally invasive nephrectomy,2024,"['Enhanced recovery after surgery', 'General anesthetics', 'Inhalation anesthesia', 'Intravenous anesthesia', 'Perioperative medicine', 'Postoperative period.']",,"Background: General anesthetic techniques can affect postoperative recovery. We compared the effect of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and desflurane anesthesia on postoperative recovery.Methods: In this randomized trial, 150 patients undergoing robot-assisted or laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal cancer were randomly allocated to either the TIVA or desflurane anesthesia (DES) group. Postoperative recovery was evaluated using the Korean version of the Quality of Recovery-15 questionnaire (QoR-15K) at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h postoperatively. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) was performed to analyze longitudinal QoR-15K data. Fentanyl consumption, pain severity, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and quality of life three weeks after discharge were also compared.Results: Data were analyzed for 70 patients in each group. The TIVA group showed significantly higher QoR-15K scores at 24 and 48 h postoperatively (24 h: DES, 96 [77, 109] vs. TIVA, 104 [82, 117], median difference 8 [95% CI: 1, 15], P = 0.029; 48 h: 110 [95, 128] vs. 125 [109, 130], median difference 8 [95% CI: 1, 15], P = 0.022), however not at 72 h (P = 0.400). The GEE revealed significant effects of group (adjusted mean difference 6.2, 95% CI: 0.39, 12.1, P = 0.037) and time (P < 0.001) on postoperative QoR-15K scores without group-time interaction (P = 0.051). However, there were no significant differences in other outcomes, except for fentanyl consumption, within the first 24 h postoperatively.Conclusions: Propofol-based TIVA showed only a transient improvement in postoperative recovery than desflurane anesthesia, without significant differences in other outcomes."

Analysis of genetic diversity and population structure in a mini core collection of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) based on URP and SCoT markers,2024,['Flax · Genetic diversity · DNA markers · Population structure · AMOVA'],,"The importance of plant genetic resources has received increasing attention in crop improvement and plant variation in breeding procedures. Here, plant variation and the structures of plant populations were examined among 93 flax accessions using SCoT and URP molecular markers. Polymorphic-fragments by URP and SCoT primers were, on average, 9.3 and 10.9, respectively, and the mean of polymorphism information content for primers revealed a good efficiency of both marker techniques (0.34 and 0.35 for URP and SCoT, respectively). The neighbor-joining (NJ)-based clustering, via combined data, classified all investigated accessions into four main groups that were further confirmed by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Moreover, molecular diversity (88%) was mostly observed inside the populations. STRUCTURE-analysis confirmed the cluster analysis and all samples were separated into four subpopulations (∆K = 4). The results implied that the sub-populations consisted of diverse accessions, suggesting that this gene pool has the potential for flax breeding programs. Furthermore, our findings indicated that URP and SCoT markers are reliable techniques in assessing plant variation, especially in elucidating the structures of flax populations. However, gene-targeting markers like SCoT are preferable because of their roots in functional genome-based regions."
Intrinsic prefrontal functional connectivity according to cognitive impairment in patients with end-stage renal disease,2024,"['Chronic kidney failure', 'Cognition', 'Connectome', 'Frontal lobe']",,"Background This study aimed to investigate differences in intrinsic prefrontal functional connectivity according to the presence of cognitive impairment in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).Methods We prospectively enrolled 37 patients with ESRD who had been undergoing hemodialysis for more than 6 months and had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. All patients with ESRD underwent the Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-K) to assess cognitive function. The NIRSIT Lite device (OBELAB Inc.) was used to acquire fNIRS data, and the NIRSIT Lite Analysis Tool program was used to process the data and generate a functional connectivity matrix. We obtained functional connectivity measures by applying graph theory to the connectivity matrix using the BRAPH (brain analysis using graph theory) program.Results Of the 37 patients with ESRD, 23 had cognitive impairment, whereas 14 patients showed no cognitive impairment. Intrinsic prefrontal functional connectivity was significantly different between groups. Network measures of strength, global efficiency, and mean clustering coefficient were lower in ESRD patients with cognitive impairment than in those without cognitive impairment (4.458 vs. 5.129, p = 0.02; 0.397 vs. 0.437, p = 0.03; and 0.316 vs. 0.421, p = 0.003; respectively). There were no significant correlations between MoCA-K scores and clinical characteristics.Conclusion We demonstrated a significant association between cognitive function and intrinsic prefrontal functional connectivity in patients with ESRD. ESRD patients with cognitive impairment have reduced connectivity and segregation in the prefrontal brain network compared to those without cognitive impairment."
"Assessment of environmental hazard impacts in building materials (Marble), Gabal El-Galala El-Bahariya, Northeastern Desert, Egypt",2024,"['Marble', 'Building materials', 'Mineral', 'Natural radioactivity', 'Hazard parameters']",,"Galala limestone is widely used for construction and ornamental purposes and is known throughout the world under many commercial names, including Galala White, Galala Golden, Galala Creama and Galala Classic. Using a HPGe spectrometer, about 20 samples from the marble building industry were radiometrically analyzed and the gamma radiation emitted by the radionuclides 238U, 232Th and 40K was evaluated. The measurements performed showed that the concentrations of these radionuclides were 15 ± 13, 6 ± 4 and 1100 ± 330 Bq kg􀀀 1, respectively.It’s important to note that all these recorded values do not exceed the internationally reported average levels of 33, 45 and 412 Bq kg􀀀 1for each individual element. The annual effective dose (AED) was estimated. The mean value of AED, 0.07 mSv/y, is comparable to the permissible average of 0.07 mSv/y, respectively. The relationship between radionuclides and their radiological hazard characteristics was studied using various multivariate statistical techniques such as Pearson correlation, principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The results indicate that the main contributors to the radiological hazard associated with marble are uranium and potassium. As a result, the use of marble in building materials may not pose a significant risk to public health."
Characterisation of runs of homozygosity and inbreeding coefficients in the red-brown Korean native chickens,2024,"['Inbreeding Coefficient', 'ROH Island', 'Run of Homozygosity', 'Selection Signatures']",,"Objective: The analysis of runs of homozygosity (ROH) has been applied to assess the level of inbreeding and identify selection signatures in various livestock species. The objectives of this study were to characterize the ROH pattern, estimate the rate of inbreeding, and identify signatures of selection in the red-brown Korean native chickens.Methods: The Illumina 60K single nucleotide polymorphism chip data of 651 chickens was used in the analysis. Runs of homozygosity were analysed using the PLINK v1.9 software. Inbreeding coefficients were estimated using the GCTA software and their correlations were examined. Genomic regions with high levels of ROH were explored to identify selection signatures.Results: A total of 32,176 ROH segments were detected in this study. The majority of the ROH segments were shorter than 4 Mb. The average ROH inbreeding coefficients (FROH) varied with the length of ROH segments. The means of inbreeding coefficients calculated from different methods were also variable. The correlations between different inbreeding coefficients were positive and highly variable (r = 0.18–1). Five ROH islands harbouring important quantitative trait loci were identified.Conclusion: This study assessed the level of inbreeding and patterns of homozygosity in Red-brown native Korean chickens. The results of this study suggest that the level of recent inbreeding is low which indicates substantial progress in the conservation of red-brown Korean native chickens. Additionally, Candidate genomic regions associated with important production traits were detected in homozygous regions."
Cellular responses to 3D-printed dental resins produced using a manufacturer recommended printer versus a third party printer,2024,"['CAD-CAM', '3D printing', 'Biocompatibility', 'Resins', 'Surface roughness']",,"Purpose. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different 3D dental resins, using a manufacturer recommended printer and a third-party printer, on cellular responses of human gingival cells. Materials and Methods. Three NextDent resins (Denture 3D+, C&B MFH and Crowntec) were used to produce specimens on printers NextDent 5100 (groups ND, NC and NT, respectively) and Phrozen Sonic Mini 4K (groups PD, PC and PT, respectively). Human gingival fibroblasts were cultured and biocompatibility was evaluated on days 1, 3 and 7. IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were evaluated at 3 days using ELISA. Surface roughness was evaluated by a contact profilometer. SEM and fluorescence micrographs were analyzed at days 1 and 7. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS and mean differences were tested using ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey tests (P < .05). Results. There was an increase in cellular viability after 7 days in groups PC and PT, when compared to group PD. ND group resulted in higher concentration of IL-6 when compared to PT group. SEM and fluorescence micrographs showed less adhesion and thinner morphology of fibroblasts from group PD. No significant differences were found regarding surface roughness. Conclusion. The use of different printers or resins did not seem to influence surface roughness. NextDent 5100 and Phrozen Sonic Mini 4K produced resins with similar cellular responses in human gingival fibroblasts. However, Denture 3D+ resin resulted in significantly lower biocompatibility, when compared to C&B MFH and Crowntec resins. Further testing is required to support its long-term use, required for complete dentures."

A total of forty samples were collected from different dental markets in Egypt. Using an NaI(Tl) detector, the gamma-ray spectrometer measured the activity levels of uranium-238, radium-226, thorium-232, and potassium-40. The findings revealed that the mean concentration of 238U (below the minimum detectable activity, MDA), 226Ra (135 ± 5 and 132 ± 5 Bq/kg), 232Th (187 ± 4 and 243 ± 8 Bq/kg), and 40K (1560 ± 52 and 2501 ± 89 Bq/kg) in feldspar and zirconia (ZrO2) dental ceramic samples, respectively, were all within the limits established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the European Commission (EC). The use of feldspar and zirconia dental ceramics to restore all teeth would result in an estimated maximum beta dose of 1.5 mGy/year to the oral tissue. The results suggest that there is no cause for concern regarding any additional beta dose to the oral cavity from the use of feldspar and zirconia dental ceramics."

As there are currently only a few brands for elderly men, this means that the following problems may arise: If an elderly man wears a middle-aged man’s top based on his chest size, the chest and hip circumferences are adequate, but the length is insufficient, the waist circumference is insufficient, and the shoulder width is considered to be excessive. Similarly, pants designed to fit a waist size designation for middle-aged individuals will be larger than intended in terms of length, hip circumference, and thigh circumference."

In this study, the effect of the number of data measuring points on the optimization of the molar ratio for the reduction process inside the catalytic layers was analyzed by computational analysis. The working fluid is composed of air, ammonia and nitric oxide. The flow is assumed to be incompressible. The flow fields were solved using the k – e turbulence model in a commercial software named ANSYS-Fluent, which is widely used in thermal flow field analysis. Based on the experimental design, DesignXplorer was used to optimize the NH3/NO molar ratio. Two types of inflow gases were selected, upward skewed inlet flow and double parabolic inlet flow. The root mean square of the NH3/NO molar ratio at the inlet of the catalyst layer was chosen as the optimization parameter. According to the numerical analysis results, when the number of measuring points increased, the value of the parameter decreased and converged to a finite value when there were about ten (10) measuring points. The effect of improving the performance by controlling the injection of ammonia was 80.7% in the case of upward skewed inlet flow and 77.5% in the case of double parabolic inlet flow."

Using an NaI(Tl) detector, the gamma-ray spectrometer measured the activity levels of uranium-238, radium-226, thorium-232, and potassium-40. The findings revealed that the mean concentration of <sup>238</sup>U (below the minimum detectable activity, MDA), <sup>226</sup>Ra (135 ± 5 and 132 ± 5 Bq/kg), <sup>232</sup>Th (187 ± 4 and 243 ± 8 Bq/kg), and <sup>40</sup>K (1560 ± 52 and 2501 ± 89 Bq/kg) in feldspar and zirconia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) dental ceramic samples, respectively, were all within the limits established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the European Commission (EC). The use of feldspar and zirconia dental ceramics to restore all teeth would result in an estimated maximum beta dose of 1.5 mGy/year to the oral tissue. The results suggest that there is no cause for concern regarding any additional beta dose to the oral cavity from the use of feldspar and zirconia dental ceramics."
A low-Reynolds-number k–ε model for polymer drag-reduction prediction in turbulent pipe flow,2024,['Turbulent flow · Drag reduction · Polyacrylamide · Low-Reynolds-number · Turbulence model · RANS'],,"Pipeline transport at high Reynolds number can result in significant turbulent losses. One of the most effective methods for turbulent drag reduction is adding a very small amount of polymer drag-reducing agent to the pipeline. However, due to the complex interaction between polymers and turbulence, turbulence models incorporating polymer additives remain to be studied and developed. In the present work, we investigated the turbulence model using Reynolds averaged numerical simulation (RANS) to describe polyacrylamide drag reduction flow. A low-Reynolds-number k–ε model in turbulent flow has been developed by considering the concentration and type of polymers, which can be applied for polymer drag reduction prediction in the pipe. Mean velocity profile Uf, turbulent intensity, turbulent kinetic energy k, and turbulent dissipation rate ε in the regions of viscous sublayer, buffer layer and logarithmic layer have been predicted with various concentration θ, Reynolds number Re, degradation degrees, and changing laws of these factors have been revealed with wall distance. The developed turbulence model showed a good capability to qualitatively forecast mean velocity profile, turbulent intensity, turbulent kinetic energy, and turbulent dissipation rate, and the prediction error between the experimental and simulated values falls along the y = x curve, which can be used for the investigation and prediction of varies water-soluble, oil-soluble polymers in turbulent drag reduction flow in pipes with other parameters such as pipe diameter, pipe length, and the Reynolds number."
Simulation-based analysis of total ionizing dose effects on low noise amplifier for wireless communications,2024,"['Simulation', 'Low noise amplifier', 'TID effects', '$0', '18{\\mu}m$ technology radiation limit', 'RF system']",,"The development of radiation-tolerant radio-frequency (RF) systems can be a solution for applications in extreme radiation environments, such as nuclear power plant monitoring and space exploration. Among the crucial components within an RF system, the low noise amplifier (LNA) stands out due to its vulnerability to TID effects, mainly relying on transistors as its main devices. In this study, the TID effects in the LNA using standard 0.18 ㎛ complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS) technology are estimated and analyzed. The results show that the LNA can withstand absorbed radiation up to 100 kGy. The S<sub>21</sub>, S<sub>11</sub>, noise figure (NF), stability (K), and linearity of the third input intercept point (IIP3) slightly shifted from the initial values of 0.8312 dB, 0.793 dB, 0.00381 dB, 1.34406, and 2.36066 dBm, respectively which are still comparable to the typical performances. Moreover, the standard 0.18 ㎛ technology has demonstrated its radiation tolerance, as it exhibits negligible performance degradation in the conventional LNA even when exposed to radiation levels up to 100 kGy. In this context, simulation approach offers a means to predict the TID effects and estimate the radiation exposure limit for electronic devices, particularly when transistors are used as the primary RF components."

First, among the major selection programs, there was a significant difference between students who chose their major in counseling with the responsible adviser and those who did not. This implies the need for professional counseling support that provides meaningful career and academic guidance to students. Second, it was found that career maturity was not correlated with satisfaction with the school of the liberal studies. This means that the quality of students who choose the school of the liberal studies deciding their career path and preparing for their career path is low. Accordingly, it is necessary to develop and provide educational programs and counseling programs that can lead to career maturity. Third, special lectures and psychological counseling were found to have programs that influence the satisfaction of the school of the liberal studies. There is a need for a responsible supervisor in charge of self-efficacy and motivation for students.Conclusions Based on these research results, discussions and implications for improving the satisfaction of the school of the liberal studies were presented, and follow-up studies for generalization of research were proposed."

However, classical support value-driven Apriori solutions are confined and unable to meet real-time enterprise demands, especially for large amounts of input data. This study introduces a groundbreaking model for top-N high utility itemset mining in real-time enterprise applications. Unlike traditional Apriori-based solutions, the proposed convolutional sequential embedding metrics-driven cosine-similarity-based multilayer perception learning model leverages global and contextual features, including semantic attributes, for enhanced top-N recommendations over sequential transactions. The MATLAB-based simulations of the model on diverse datasets, demonstrated an impressive precision (0.5632), mean absolute error (MAE) (0.7610), hit rate (HR)@K (0.5720), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG)@K (0.4268). The average MAE across different datasets and latent dimensions was 0.608. Additionally, the model achieved remarkable cumulative accuracy and precision of 97.94% and 97.04% in performance, respectively, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models. This affirms the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed model in real-time enterprise scenarios."

TomoRay: Generating Synthetic  Computed Tomography of the Spine  From Biplanar Radiographs,2024,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Image conversion', 'Synthetic computed tomography', 'Spine', 'Machine learning']",,"Objective: Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a cornerstone in the assessment of patients with spinal trauma and in the planning of spinal interventions. However, CT studies are associated with logistical problems, acquisition costs, and radiation exposure. In this proof-of-concept study, the feasibility of generating synthetic spinal CT images using biplanar radiographs was explored. This could expand the potential applications of x-ray machines pre-, post-, and even intraoperatively.Methods: A cohort of 209 patients who underwent spinal CT imaging from the VerSe2020 dataset was used to train the algorithm. The model was subsequently evaluated using an internal and external validation set containing 55 from the VerSe2020 dataset and a subset of 56 images from the CTSpine1K dataset, respectively. Digitally reconstructed radiographs served as input for training and evaluation of the 2-dimensional (2D)-to-3-dimentional (3D) generative adversarial model. Model performance was assessed using peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and cosine similarity (CS).Results: At external validation, the developed model achieved a PSNR of 21.139 ± 1.018 dB (mean ± standard deviation). The SSIM and CS amounted to 0.947 ± 0.010 and 0.671 ± 0.691, respectively.Conclusion: Generating an artificial 3D output from 2D imaging is challenging, especially for spinal imaging, where x-rays are known to deliver insufficient information frequently.Although the synthetic CT scans derived from our model do not perfectly match their ground truth CT, our proof-of-concept study warrants further exploration of the potential of this technology."
Clinical Performance Comparison of Ultrahigh-speed Dual Pneumatic Vitrectomy Probes: Is Faster and Smaller Better?,2024,"['Epiretinal membrane', 'Retinal perforations', 'Sutures', 'Time', 'Vitrectomy']",,"Purpose: Various vitrectomy probes are currently being used commercially, and there are ongoing efforts toward developing probes with higher cutting rates and smaller gauges. This study aimed to compare the efficiency and safety of various commercially available small gauge ultrahigh-speed dual pneumatic vitrectomy probes.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients and recorded intraoperative videos while they underwent microincision three-port vitrectomy surgery for idiopathic epiretinal membrane at Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital. The patients were categorized into four groups based on the vitrectomy probe used during surgery: 23-7500 (UltraVit 23-gauge 7,500 cuts per minute [CPM]), 23-7500 (UltraVit 25-gauge 7,500 CPM), 25-10K (Advanced UltraVit 25-gauge 10,000 CPM), and 27-10K (Advanced UltraVit 27-gauge 10,000 CPM).Results: In total, 82 eyes from 82 patients were included in this work, with 16, 11, 26, and 29 eyes in groups 23-7500, 25- 7500, 25-10K, and 27-10K, respectively. The corresponding vitrectomy times were 295.56 ± 53.55, 293.09 ± 50.28, 299.92 ± 59.42, and 349.38 ± 67.23 seconds, respectively. There was a significant difference in the vitrectomy time between the groups (p = 0.004). The mean number of sutures was 3, 3, 2.96, and 0.83, respectively. In the 23-7500 group, there was one case of iatrogenic retinal break, while in the 27-10K group, there was one case of postoperative hypotony.Conclusions: Although advancements have been made in the 27-gauge vitrectomy probe, it still takes more vitrectomy time than it does when using the 23- and 25-gauge probes. However, the delay was within an average of 1 minute, and considering the significantly reduced need for sutures, there is a substantial benefit in terms of postoperative discomfort. Therefore, when choosing a probe for epiretinal membrane surgery among the four options, it is reasonable to select the 27-gauge probe according to the surgeon’s preference."

Our research participant was a female youth who had immigrated to South Korea as a young adolescent. To explore the longitudinal dynamic interactions of individual, family, school, and community factors, we conducted a narrative analysis of a life story collected by semi-structured interviews. Study findings showed that the Koryoin immigrant youth had faced social discrimination in both countries of Russia and Korea, which meant denied national and ethnic identities. However, individual efforts, support from family, peers, and teachers, and participation in the religious community have worked for her personal growth. She finally reported a successful adjustment to Korean society. This study also suggested a hybridity of identities achieved from her various experiences as a Koryoin while overcoming immigration life challenges.

But the NP group had a tendency to recur more thanthe non-NP group while 20 counts/HPF definition was used ( p>0.05).Conclusion HNE staining and 20 counts/HPF were the most specific for neutrophil count-ing. Analyzing the nasal polyp into two groups due to histologic types showed that the NPgroup had worse prognosis than the non-NP group. In conclusion, neutrophils in the nasal pol-yp might be considered seriously for clinical outcomes."

To make accurate decisions regarding operational measures, reliable and precise models of environmental conditions and effects of hull fouling are required. In this study, a data-driven approach using linear regression was applied to predict shaft power, fuel consumption, and speed after intensive data preparation and feature engineering. First, a shaft power prediction model was developed by combining three independent submodels: the RPM-power model, hull fouling model, and environmental effect model. Subsequently, fuel consumption and speed prediction models were developed based on the shaft power prediction model. Model validation was performed on a 174K LNG carrier, and the results showed good accuracy even in long-term ship operations of more than two years. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of the prediction models were 1.60%, 1.70%, and 2.68% for the shaft power, fuel consumption, and speed, respectively. The validated models were applied to two LNG carriers, and satisfactory results were obtained.

토픽 모델링과 LSTM을 사용한 KOSPI 지수 예측,2024,"['Topic Modeling', 'LSTM', 'Machine Learning', 'Predictive Modeling', 'LDA', '토픽 모델링', '머신러닝', '예측 모델링']",,"In this paper, we proposes a method to improve the accuracy of predicting the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) by combining topic modeling and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. In this paper, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique to extract ten major topics related to interest rate increases and decreases from financial news data. The extracted topics, along with historical KOSPI index data, are input into an LSTM model to predict the KOSPI index. The proposed model has the characteristic of predicting the KOSPI index by combining the time series prediction method by inputting the historical KOSPI index into the LSTM model and the topic modeling method by inputting news data. To verify the performance of the proposed model, this paper designs four models (LSTM_K model, LSTM_KNS model, LDA_K model, LDA_KNS model) based on the types of input data for the LSTM and presents the predictive performance of each model. The comparison of prediction performance results shows that the LSTM model (LDA_K model), which uses financial news topic data and historical KOSPI index data as inputs, recorded the lowest RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), demonstrating the best predictive performance."
Genetic and phenotypic diversity in Solanum lycopersicum genotypes: insights from morpho-molecular and biochemical analyses,2024,['Solanum lycopersicum\xa0· Simple sequence repeats\xa0· Polymorphism information content\xa0· Population structure\xa0· Genetic diversity'],,"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) crop is well-known for its versatility worldwide and is also recognized as model species used extensively for various genetic studies. The aim of this research was to investigate both inter and intra-genetic diversity present among various tomato genotypes. This investigation was carried out through a comprehensive analysis encompass- ing morphological observations, biochemical assessments, and the utilization of SSR markers. A total of 15 discrete agro- morphological traits and six biochemical traits were undertaken in the current study for evaluating the analysis of variance, genetic parameters and correlation. The analysis of variance indicated significant differences across genotypes for all 15 agro-morphological traits and 6 biochemical traits tested, indicating that the experimental material included considerable vari- ability. Morphological clustering divided the genotypes into 2 clusters and the genotype wise distance matrix was obtained to identify the most diverse genotypes. PCA analysis was conducted to understand the directive relation of traits and magnitude of variability contributed by them. SSR profiling with 24 primers identified 44 alleles with 1.83 as mean number of alleles/ SSR with an average PIC value of 0.31. Structure analysis revealed two sub-populations (K = 2). The AMOVA indicated that 98% of the total variation was present within populations. This study presents a roadmap for composing future breeding strategies for integrating desirable traits in novel tomato lines that combine robustness and nutritive value."
Ten-eleven translocation 1 mediating DNA demethylation regulates the proliferation of chicken primordial germ cells through the activation of Wnt4/β-catenin signaling pathway,2024,"['β-Catenin', 'Demethylation', 'Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs)', 'Proliferation', 'Ten-eleven Translocation 1 (Tet1)']",,"Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the regulation relationship of Teneleven translocation 1 (Tet1) in DNA demethylation and the proliferation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in chickens.Methods: siRNA targeting Tet1 was used to transiently knockdown the expression of Tet1 in chicken PGCs, and the genomic DNA methylation status was measured. The proliferation of chicken PGCs was detected by flow cytometry analysis and cell counting kit-8 assay when activation or inhibition of Wnt4/β-catenin signaling pathway. And the level of DNA methylation and hisotne methylation was also tested.Results: Results revealed that knockdown of Tet1 inhibited the proliferation of chicken PGCs and downregulated the mRNA expression of Cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), as well as pluripotency-associated genes (Nanog, PouV, and Sox2). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the population of PGCs in Tet1 knockdown group displayed a significant decrease in the proportion of S and G2 phase cells, which meant that there were less PGCs entered the mitosis process than that of control. Furthermore, Tet1 knockdown delayed the entrance to G1/S phase and this inhibition was rescued by treated with BIO.Consistent with these findings, Wnt/β-catenin signaling was inactivated in Tet1 knockdown PGCs, leading to aberrant proliferation. Further analysis showed that the methylation of the whole genome increased significantly after Tet1 downregulation, while hydroxymethylation obviously declined. Meanwhile, the level of H3K27me3 was upregulated and H3K9me2 was downregulated in Tet1 knockdown PGCs, which was achieved by regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.Conclusion: These results suggested that the self-renewal of chicken PGCs and the maintenance of their characteristics were regulated by Tet1 mediating DNA demethylation through the activation of Wnt4/β-catenin signaling pathway."
Characterization of Ceramic Beads for the Removal of Organic Micropollutants from Wastewater and Prediction of Their Adsorption Properties by In Silico Quantitative Structure–Adsorption Relationship Modeling,2024,['Ceramic beads · Micropollutants · Adsorption · Langmuir · LFER modeling · Prediction · In silico'],,"This study shows that ceramic beads, which are often used as adsorbents in wastewater treatment, can adsorb a wide range of organic micropollutants in both ionic and non-ionic forms, and the adsorption properties can be characterized through experimental studies and theoretical modeling. Actually, since there is a myriad type of chemicals, there is a limit to experimentally investigating the adsorption properties of ceramic beads. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the adsorption properties experimentally, while a prediction model for the adsorption relationship between ceramic beads and chemicals is developed.In this study, the adsorption properties of ceramic beads, as estimated by performing isotherms and fi tting Langmuir and Freundlich models, were predicted using linear free energy relationship descriptors comprising in silico calculated descriptors.In addition, the Langmuir model derives maximum uptake ( q m ) and adsorption affi nity ( b ), and the Freundlich model estimates equilibrium constant ( K F ), meaning maximum uptake, and Freundlich exponent ( n ), as an indicator of adsorption compatibility. The results demonstrated that ceramic beads can be considered a suitable type of adsorbent and have heterogeneous adsorptions, as confi rmed by Freundlich fi tting. In the modeling study, it was checked that the employed linear free energy relationship (LFER) model could not be used to predict the heterogeneous adsorption properties estimated by the Freundlich model, while it could predict the homogeneous properties estimated by the Langmuir model. The developed model could predict the q m in R 2 of 0.70 with a standard error of 0.22 log units and the adsorption affi nity (log b ) in R 2 of 0.71 with a standard error of 0.38 log units. These results will help predict the adsorption properties of unstudied micropollutants on ceramic beads."

It is used for various natural language processing tasks. One specific task related to the Knowledge Graph is Knowledge Graph Completion, which involves reasoning with known facts in the graph and automatically inferring missing links. In order to tackle this task, studies have been conducted on both link prediction and relation prediction. Recently, there has been significant interest in a dual-encoder architecture that utilizes textual information. However, the dataset for link prediction only provides descriptions for entities, not for relations. As a result, the model heavily relies on descriptions for entities. To address this issue, we utilized a large language model called GPT-3.5-turbo to generate relation descriptions. This allows the baseline model to be trained with more comprehensive relation information. Moreover, the relation descriptions generated by our proposed method are expected to improve the performance of other language model-based link prediction models. The evaluation results for link prediction demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline model on various datasets, including Korean ConceptNet, WN18RR, FB15k-237, and YAGO3-10.

Application of deep learning with bivariate models for genomic prediction of sow lifetime productivity-related traits,2024,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'Deep Learning', 'Epistatic Interaction', 'Genomic Prediction', 'Pig', 'Sow Lifetime Productivity']",,"Objective: Pig breeders cannot obtain phenotypic information at the time of selection for sow lifetime productivity (SLP). They would benefit from obtaining genetic information of candidate sows. Genomic data interpreted using deep learning (DL) techniques could contribute to the genetic improvement of SLP to maximize farm profitability because DL models capture nonlinear genetic effects such as dominance and epistasis more efficiently than conventional genomic prediction methods based on linear models. This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of DL for the genomic prediction of two SLP-related traits; lifetime number of litters (LNL) and lifetime pig production (LPP).Methods: Two bivariate DL models, convolutional neural network (CNN) and local convolutional neural network (LCNN), were compared with conventional bivariate linear models (i.e., genomic best linear unbiased prediction, Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, and Bayes B). Phenotype and pedigree data were collected from 40,011 sows that had husbandry records. Among these, 3,652 pigs were genotyped using the PorcineSNP60K BeadChip.Results: The best predictive correlation for LNL was obtained with CNN (0.28), followed by LCNN (0.26) and conventional linear models (approximately 0.21). For LPP, the best predictive correlation was also obtained with CNN (0.29), followed by LCNN (0.27) and conventional linear models (approximately 0.25). A similar trend was observed with the mean squared error of prediction for the SLP traits.Conclusion: This study provides an example of a CNN that can outperform against the linear model-based genomic prediction approaches when the nonlinear interaction components are important because LNL and LPP exhibited strong epistatic interaction components. Additionally, our results suggest that applying bivariate DL models could also contribute to the prediction accuracy by utilizing the genetic correlation between LNL and LPP."

Public transportation, by definition, is the means of transportation used by most people. This study will provide an indepth look into the lives of the people using this means of transportation by shedding light on the specific situation of public transportation during the Japanese Occupation.This study introduces the process of restoring the routes and stops of Seoul(Gyeongseong) trams during the Japanese colonial rule through the use of digital devices. For this work, the researcher tested the related content of various materials and reverified the history of tram construction before examining changes to the tram routes and restoring the results with a digital device called Google Maps.Universal tools were used, such as Google Earth, Google Maps(My Maps), and Excel in the process of digitally restoring the stops and routes of the Seoul(Gyeongseong) trams. By analyzing the data about the stops of Seoul(Gyeongseong) trams, the study identified and confirmed the stops and routes that represented each of their main eras. By using this information, the study acquired GPS coordinate values (dots) for the stops and embodied the routes connecting the dots on Google Maps to make them ‘open access’.The digital restoration of the tram routes embodied in this way can help people perceive the spaces of life culture connected to the Seoul(Gyeongseong) area in the present geographical sense. As they were restored with a digital device that was expandable and highly usable, anyone could utilize Seoul(Gyeongseong)’s tram routes during the Japanese colonial rule regardless of time and space limitations.As a result, the present study is considered a humanities platform in a historical context that it fuses in digital technology. That is, the digital route map restored in the study will serve as a basis to define spatial compositions in various aspects including history, literature, and art during the Japanese colonial rule.URL: https://url.kr/aoxx1k"

From the late Koryŏ dynasty to the early Chosŏn period, the military and household administration were closely intertwined, with regular soldiers [chŏnggun] designated as household representatives in the household register, meaning that the number of households directly represented the number of military personnel. The relationship was weakened by the introduction of the Paired Provisioner System [pobŏp]. However, military administration based on household registration remained largely in place for an extended period. In particular, regular soldiers assigned to central military divisions were selected among the heads of the household, and the military quota assigned to each region was reflected in the household register. From the late eighteenth century, the relationship between the main text of the household register and its statistical record [toisang] began to weaken, gradually eroding the role of the household register in securing the personal information of those subject to military service. Nevertheless, the institutional framework continued to follow the existing patterns.In contrast, the sogo militia force was initially created as a military system that was separate from the administrative structure based on the household register. Over time, the sogo force became partially integrated into the household register system, resulting in military obligators for the sogo militias appearing in the household registers. However, the number of the sogo force as recorded in the household register was significantly lower than the number officially allocated by the military administration. This structure was evident both in the main text and in the statistical records of the household register, which documented the allocated quotas.The household register included only a part of the required number of the sogo force. The remainder was filled by those who were not included in the household register and by those who were obligated with both regular national duty and the duty of sogo militia. This administrative structure was not only established at the local county level, but was also officially sanctioned by the central government.The reason for the partial separation of the sogo force from the household register system was that the sogo force was established as an emergency mobilization system during the Imjin War. As a temporary measure, the sogo force was not fully integrated into the existing system, which resulted in the military administrative being separated from the household register. Over time, this structure became more permanent and continued after the war. The appearance of the sogo force within the household register serves as an indicator that the military administration—especially at the local level—was institutionally established and operated as a separate entity from the household administration."

Since No-judgement Mind is the middle way(中道) freed from Tetralemma of Right or Wrong(是非), Take or Leave(取捨), it is not different from Awaken the Truth(大道體得), which was destructed by The mind and The Buddha, and it is Nirvana where Prapañca Stops Eternally.Throughout this study, the logical structure which is inherent in “The mind is Buddha” and “No-judgement Mind” of Mazu was examined to be based on the dialectic of Nāgārjuna and Four Phrases(四句) on ancient Indian logic. By proving that it was made in combination with Tetralemma’s dialectic argumentation and multi level’s dialectic logic of the theory of Two Truths in Three Steps in Prajñā-Madhyamaka Studies, it confirms that Mazu-Seon thought has been in the process of continuation and succession, not disconnection from the Thought of Seon of the India, that is to say, it has been misunderstood that it is the independent Seon of the China."

공연 입장권 유통 질서 개선을 위한 「공연법」 개정방안 연구,2024,"['공연티켓', '공연입장권', '공연유통질서', '암표', '매크로', 'Performance tickets', 'performance admission tickets', 'performance law revision', 'scalping', 'macro']","최근 코로나 19의 어둠이 걷히고 서서히 공연 산업이 다시 활기를 띄고 공연을 찾는 수요가 증가하자 매크로 프로그램 등의 불법 수단을 이용하여 공연 입장권을 취득한 뒤 폭리를 취하는 자들이 증가하고 있다. 이에 문화체육관광부는 2024년 6월 28일, 이 문제를 암표의 문제로 보고 “암표 근절방안 공청회”를 진행하며 공연입장권의 공정 한 유통질서 확립을 위해 안간힘을 쓰고 있다. 공연 입장권 판매와 구매의 법리는 매매계약에 해당하므로 민법의 기본원칙인 사적 자치의 원칙인 ‘계약 자유의 원칙’ 아래에 있다. 그러므로 ｢공연법｣ 제4조의2와 ｢경범 죄처벌법｣ 제3조 2항 제4호, 기타 강행 규정이 없는 한 ‘계약자유의 원칙’은 민법의 기본원칙상 지켜져야 할 규범이다. ｢공연법｣ 제4조의2 제2항이 매크로를 통해 티켓을 구매한 자가 이를 재판매했을 때 형사 처벌하는 규정이라고 한다면,｢경범죄처벌법｣ 제3조 2항 제4호는 흥행장, 경기장, 역, 나루터, 정류장, 그 밖에 정하여진 요금을 받고 입장시키거나 승차 또는 승선시키 는 곳에서 웃돈을 받고 암표를 판매한 자를 형사처벌하는 규정이다. ｢공연법｣ 제4조의 2 제2항이 매크로를 통해 티켓을 구매한 자가 이를 재판매했을 때 형사처벌하게 되면 1년 이하의 징역 또는 1천만 원 이하의 벌금에 처할 수 있으며, ｢경범죄처벌법｣ 제3조 2항 제4호를 위반하여 웃돈을 받고 암표를 판매하면 20만원 이하의 벌금, 구류 또는 과료의 형으로 처벌한다. 두 규정은 공연티켓판매의 유통질서와 관련한 현행법상 강행법규로서 웃돈을 받고 암표를 판매하는 재판매행위와 매크로 프로그램을 이용하여 티켓을 구매한 뒤 재판매 하는 두 행위는 입장권 부정판매행위에 해당한다. 각국도 자신의 공연 산업에 있어 공연기획자와 소비자를 보호하기 위해 재판매를 관리하고 암표를 근절하며 온라인상 매크로를 금지하는 등 공연 입장권 유통질서를 바로 세우기 위해 입법, 사법적 노력을 하고 있다. 현재 우리나라 ｢공연법｣과 ｢경범죄처벌법｣은 실제 적용한 예가 거의 없을 정도로 실효성이 매우 낮을 뿐만 아니라 글로벌 공연유통질서에 상당히 미흡한 부분이 있다. 이에 본 논문에서는 우리 공연법상 유통질서의 문제점을 살펴보고 그 개선방안으로서 각국의 입법방식인 재판매 입법접근 방식과 매크로 프로그램 금지접근 방식에 대해 살펴보고자 한다. 부디 정부의 관심이 이어져 K 컬처의 위상만큼 공연 유통 제도도 국제적으로 모범적으로 입법화되고 우리 법제가 해외에 모법화되어 부정 예매 없고 성숙한 공연 유통질서 아래 다양한 문화 욕구를 해소시킬 수 있는 고품격 무대가 많이 제작되어 대중과 소통되기를 기대한다.","Recently, as the darkness of COVID-19 has lifted and the performance industry has gradually become more active again and the demand for performances has increased, the number of people who use illegal means such as macro programs to obtain performance tickets and make profit is increasing. Accordingly, on June 28, 2024, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism is making every effort to establish a fair distribution order for performance tickets by viewing this issue as a problem of ticket scalping and holding a “public hearing on measures to eradicate ticket scalping.” Since the legal principle of selling and purchasing performance tickets corresponds to a sales contract, it falls under the ‘principle of freedom of contract’, which is the principle of private autonomy, which is a basic principle of civil law. Therefore, unless there are Article 4-2 of the Public Performance Act, Article 3, Paragraph 2, Item 4 of the Misdemeanor Punishment Act, and other mandatory provisions, the ‘principle of freedom of contract’ is a norm that must be observed as a basic principle of civil law. If Article 4-2, Paragraph 2 of the Performance Act provides for criminal punishment when a person who purchased a ticket through a macro resells it, Article 3, Paragraph 2, Subparagraph 4 of the Misdemeanor Punishment Act provides for entertainment venues, stadiums, stations, and ferry terminals. This is a regulation that criminalizes anyone who sells scalped tickets for an additional fee at a bus stop or other place where a fixed fee is paid to enter, board, or board a vehicle. According to Article 4-2, Paragraph 2 of the Performance Act, if a person who purchases a ticket through a macro resells the ticket, he or she may be subject to criminal punishment, imprisonment for up to one year or a fine not exceeding 10 million won. Article 3 of the Misdemeanor Punishment Act Anyone who violates Paragraph 2, Paragraph 4 and sells black tickets for an additional amount of money will be punished by a fine not exceeding 200,000 won, detention, or minor fine. The two regulations are mandatory laws under the current law related to the distribution order of performance ticket sales, and the two acts of reselling by selling scalped tickets for an additional amount and reselling after purchasing tickets using a macro program are considered illegal sales of admission tickets. In order to protect performance planners and consumers in their own performance industry, each country is making legislative and judicial efforts to establish a proper order of performance ticket distribution, such as managing resale, eradicating ticket scalping, and banning online macros. Currently, Korea's ｢Performance Act｣ and ｢Misdemeanor Punishment Act｣ not only have very low effectiveness to the extent that there are almost no actual cases of application, but also have significant shortcomings in the global performance distribution order. Accordingly, in this paper, we will examine the problems with the distribution order under our performance law and examine each country's legislative approach, the resale legislative approach and the macro program prohibition approach, as ways to improve them. As the government's interest continues, the performance distribution system will be legislated internationally as an example to the status of K Culture, and our legal system will be modeled overseas, producing many high-quality stages that can satisfy various cultural needs under a mature performance distribution order without illegal ticket sales. We look forward to communicating with the public."

This form of malnutrition occurs not only in developing countries but also in developed nations where staple foods include grains such as wheat and corn. Among cereal crops, the color of wheat grains can vary due to the presence of different pigments in the bran layers. Colored wheat, rich in functional compounds such as anthocyanins, offers various health benefits primarily due to its antioxidant properties. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the phenotypic and nutritional characteristics of wheat germplasm ‘IT016425’ compared with domestic wheat cultivars, with the intention of considering the introduction of this germplasm for breeding purposes. In the field trial, ‘IT016425’ had a heading date and maturity that were 22 and 8 days later than ‘Keumgang’, respectively. ‘IT016425’ also presented the tallest plant height (105.1 cm) but the shortest spike length (7.8 cm) and spike number (14 per plant). The thousand grain weight was similar to that of ‘Tapdong’, measuring 39.0 g. ‘IT016425’ had the lowest protein content, with a mean value of 12.1%, whereas ‘Keumgang’ had the highest protein content (15.5%). However, ‘Tapdong’ and ‘IT016425’ compensated for their lower protein content by having higher levels of total dietary fiber. These cultivars exhibited the highest total dietary fiber content, with mean values of 3.16 and 3.29 g/100 g, respectively, whereas ‘Keumgang’ and ‘Arijinheuk’ had lower values. ‘IT016425’ also had the highest content of anthocyanin, with a mean value of 1.61 mg/100 g. Additionally, ‘IT016425’ had the highest levels of minerals such as K (230.64 mg/100 g), P (190.31 mg/100 g), Mg (45.40 mg/100 g), Zn (1.06 mg/100 g), Mn (0.54 mg/100 g), and Cu (0.12 mg/100 g) compared to the other tested cultivars.Cultivating ‘IT016425’ in Korea may not be suitable due to the common practice of rice-wheat double-cropping, as it has delayed heading and maturity. However, considering its high anthocyanin and mineral content, it is necessary to introduce the beneficial traits of ‘IT016425’ into breeding programs."

The Donghak Peasant Revolution, which sought to build a new world by advocating antifeudalism and antiinvasion, u n f o l d e d n a t i o n w i d e u n t i l J a n u a r y 1 8 9 5 . T h e D o n g h a k Peasant Revolution is evaluated as an effort for independent modernization. Donghak in Jeolla-Province, which had been spread during the Choi Je-woo era, was reintroduced in 1884 and spread throughout Jeolla-do within 10 years. In particular, Choi Sihyeong’s teachings, which emphasized dismantling social status and emphasizing the practice of Donghak ideology, penetrated into the people. Jeon Bong-Jun, who entered Donghak around 1890 and became the local director, Jeopju, made his name known widely by participating in the Kyojo Shinwon Movement as a submitter, and based on this, he grew his influence in the Gobu region. The people of Gobu County demanded correction for Jo Byeong-gap’s bad politics, but were rejected. Accordingly, Jeon Bong-jun and enthusiastic Donghak students created a Sabaltongmun to simulate an religious uprising, but it was aborted due to Jo Byeong-gap’s resignation. However, when Jo Byeong-gap was again appointed as the governor of Gobu County, Jeon Bong-jun put his plan into action. This Gobu religious uprising was the beginning of the Donghak Peasant Revolution. The basis for saying that Gobu’s Donghak Peasant Revolution was a ‘religious upring’ is, first, that Jeon Bong-jun said that their actions were a religious upring during the interrogation process. Second, it can be seen that it is a religious upring through the terminology of the school group used in a Sabaltongmun. Third, it can be seen that it was a religious movement through the election of Jeon Bong-jun as Dongdo Daejang, which means the leader of Donghak Army, at the Baeksan Congress. Furthermore, the fact that the date of the declaration announcing the revolution at the Baeksan Congress was set in January is conclusive evidence that the Donghak Peasant Revolution began in Gobu. Therefore, it can be said that the he Gobu Donghak Peasant Revolution, which marked the beginning of the Donghak Peasant Revolution, had the universality of a peasant uprising, but it was a historical event that emphasized the particularity of the ‘religious uprising’ that tried to create a new world based on the ideology and organization of Donghak. The first reason why the Gobu Donghak Peasant Revolution was characterized as a ‘religious upring’ rather than a ‘peasant uprising’ is that Jeon Bong-jun himself called it a ‘religious upring’. Second, it can be said to be a ‘religious upring’ in that the term used by the Donghak sect appears in the Sabaltongmun, which simulates the Gobu Donghak peasant revolution. Third, it can be seen that Jeon Bong-jun is a ‘religious upring’ through the election of Jeon Bong-jun as Dongdo Daejang, which means the leader of Donghak Army, at the Baeksan Congress. Fourth, the “Gyeokmun” of the Baeksan Congress can be said to be a ‘spirit’ in that it contains the spirit of helping the country, protecting the people, and providing relief to the people widely, as advocated by Donghak. In addition, the fact that the date of the “Gyeokmun” at the Baeksan Congress held in late March was January 1894 is an immovable evidence that the Donghak Peasant Revolution began in Gobu. Based on the above evidence, the Gobu Donghak Peasant Revolution, which announced the beginning of the Donghak Peasant Revolution, can be said to be a historical event in which the specificity of ‘religious upring’, which attempted to create a new world based on the ideology and organization of Donghak, was emphasized more than the universality of the peasant uprising."

The dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) is composed of a membership hesitant function as well as a non-membership hesitant function. In this investigation, we developed a new scoring formula for converting dual hesitant fuzzy numbers (DHFNs) to crisp values and suggested a novel algorithm called contraharmonic mean for addressing the dual hesitant fuzzy problem of transportation. Excel solver is utilized to find the contraharmonic mean. Additionally, we employed the modified distribution (MODI) method to achieve the best possible result. The recommended approach is then explained using a mathematical instance, and its efficacy can be demonstrated by comparing it to previously used techniques."

The World Festival of Youth and Students, an international event born out of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, a youth organization sponsored by the Soviet Union, began with the 1st Prague Festival in 1947. While serving as a meeting place within the socialist bloc amidst the deepening Cold War order, the festival advocated for peace and friendship, presenting itself as a venue for cultural exchange among young people worldwide. The artistic competition, one of the key programs of the Festival, became a ‘cultural Olympics’ where youth from various countries competed in artistic abilities. North Korea has participated since the first Festival in 1947, consistently sending delegations to the artistic competitions. In the early years, the participation itself held significant meaning under the conditions shortly after liberation. However, starting from the 6th Festival held in 1957, North Korea made remarkable achievements in the competitions, and these outstanding results continued until North Korea’s last participation in the 1973 Berlin Festival. This paper provides a historical overview of North Korea’s achievements in the Festival’s artistic competitions and examines the significance attributed to them. Meanwhile, the achievements in the Festival’s artistic competitions shed light on specific aspects of North Korea’s literary and artistic development after liberation, particularly revealing various issues in the music sector. These issues were closely related to North Korea’s literary and artistic policy, which centered around socialist realism principles from the late 1950s to the 1960s. The development of North Korean music during this period unfolded as a quest for solutions to establishing the Juche as demanded by Kim Il Sung, within the framework of socialist realism, in both traditional and contemporary music. The issues raised during this process were reflected in the artistic competitions from the 6th Festival in 1957 to the 8th Festival in 1962."
