Supervised deep learning-based synthetic computed tomography from kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography images for adaptive radiation therapy in head and neck cancer,2024,"['Cone-beam computed tomography', 'Synthetic CT', 'Deep learning', 'Supervised U-Net', 'Adaptive radiation therapy', 'Head and neck cancer']",,"Purpose: To generate and investigate a supervised deep learning algorithm for creating synthetic computed tomography (sCT) images from kilovoltage cone-beam CT (kV-CBCT) images for adaptive radiation therapy (ART) in head and neck cancer (HNC).Materials and Methods: This study generated the supervised U-Net deep learning model using 3,491 image pairs from planning CT (pCT) and kV-CBCT datasets obtained from 40 HNC patients. The dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. The evaluation of the sCT images compared to pCT images focused on three aspects: Hounsfield units accuracy, assessed using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE); image quality, evaluated using the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) between sCT and pCT images; and dosimetric accuracy, encompassing 3D gamma passing rates for dose distribution and percentage dose difference.Results: MAE, RMSE, PSNR, and SSIM showed improvements from their initial values of 53.15 ± 40.09, 153.99 ± 79.78, 47.91 ± 4.98 dB, and 0.97 ± 0.02 to 41.47 ± 30.59, 130.39 ± 78.06, 49.93 ± 6.00 dB, and 0.98 ± 0.02, respectively. Regarding dose evaluation, 3D gamma passing rates for dose distribution within sCT images under 2%/2 mm, 3%/2 mm, and 3%/3 mm criteria, yielded passing rates of 92.1% ± 3.8%, 93.8% ± 3.0%, and 96.9% ± 2.0%, respectively. The sCT images exhibited minor variations in the percentage dose distribution of the investigated target and structure volumes. However, it is worth noting that the sCT images exhibited anatomical variations when compared to the pCT images.Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of the supervised U-Net deep learningmodel in generating kV-CBCT-based sCT images for ART in patients with HNC."
Deep Learning-Based Inverse Design for Engineering Systems: A Study on Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Models,2024,"['Deep Learning', 'Inverse Design', 'Design Optimization', 'Supervised and Unsupervised Learning']",,"Recent studies have shown that inverse design using deep learning has the potential to rapidly generate the optimal design that satisfies the target performance without the need for iterative optimization processes. Unlike traditional methods, deep learning allows the network to rapidly generate a large number of solution candidates for the same objective after a single training, and enables the generation of diverse designs tailored to the objectives of inverse design. These inverse design techniques are expected to significantly enhance the efficiency and innovation of design processes in various fields such as aerospace, biology, medical, and engineering. We analyzes inverse design models that are mainly utilized in the nano and chemical fields, and proposes inverse design models based on supervised and unsupervised learning that can be applied to the engineering system. It is expected to present the possibility of effectively applying inverse design methodologies to the design optimization problem in the field of engineering according to each specific objective."
Improved contrastive learning model via identification of false-negatives in self-supervised learning,2024,"['contrastive learning', 'data representation', 'false-negatives', 'self-supervised learning']",,"Self-supervised learning is a method that learns the data representation through unlabeled data. It is efficient because it learns from large-scale unla-beled data and through continuous research, performance comparable to supervised learning has been reached. Contrastive learning, a type of self-supervised learning algorithm, utilizes data similarity to perform instance-level learning within an embedding space. However, it suffers from the problem of false-negatives, which are the misclassification of data class during training the data representation. They result in loss of information and deteriorate the performance of the model. This study employed cosine similarity and tempera-ture simultaneously to identify false-negatives and mitigate their impact to improve the performance of the contrastive learning model. The proposed method exhibited a performance improvement of up to 2.7% compared with the existing algorithm on the CIFAR-100 dataset. Improved performance on other datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet was also observed."
Contrastive Learning with Cross-Part Bidirectional Distillation for Self-supervised Skeleton-Based Action Recognition,2024,"['Skeleton-based Action Recognition', 'Contrastive Learning', 'Self-attention', 'Knowledge Distillation', 'Skeleton Segmentation']",,"Since self-supervised learning does not require a large amount of labelled data, some methods have employed self-supervised contrastive learning for 3D skeleton-based action recognition. As the skeleton sequence is a highly correlated data modality, current work only considers the global skeleton sequence after forming different views by data augmentation and input to the contrastive encoding network. Moreover, it does not focus on the local semantic information of the skeleton that leads to certain fine-grained and ambiguous classes of actions on which existing methods may be more difficult to distinguish. Therefore, we propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method with bidirectional knowledge distillation across part streams for skeleton-based action recognition. On the one hand, unlike traditional methods, a pose based factorization of skeleton sequences is performed to form two partial streams, and employ a single partial stream contrastive learning method to encode action features for each of these two streams. On the other hand, we design a contrastive learning framework based on relational knowledge distillation, named cross-part bidirectional distillation (CPBD), to train the upstream self-supervised model in a more reasonable way, and to improve the downstream action recognition accuracy. The proposed recognition framework is evaluated on three datasets: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD, which achieves the state-of-the-art result performance, and we obtained 92.0% accuracy in PKU-MMD Part I with the linear evaluation protocol. Furthermore, the recognition architecture could distinguish more challenging ambiguous action samples, such as touch head, touch neck, etc."
"SARA: A Lightweight, Unknown-Oriented, Semi- Supervised Network Traffic Classification Approach Based on Ensemble Multiple Sub-classifiers Learning",2024,"['Network Traffic Classification', 'Semi-supervised Learning', 'Feature Selection', 'Deep Auto-coder', 'Clustering Analysis']",,"Machine learning (ML) technology is critical to flow statistical features for network traffic classification. Unfortunately, much work has been focused on using ML techniques to solve the problems related to the classification of network traffic, such as a severe degradation in classification performance and the difficulty of identifying unknown flows in the real world. Such problems are mainly caused by flow features’ high dimensionality and redundancy, the imbalanced number of traffic classes, concept drift due to Internet traffic, and over reliance on labeled data. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach based on the idea of semi-supervised learning for network traffic classification, called SARA (feature Selection, deep Auto-coder, Redundancy Analysis), which introduces deep learning, efficient feature processing methods and a heuristic traffic classification model in order to achieve an outstanding overall optimization. This paper shows analytically that SARA can solve the unknown flow identification problem in most situations. Based on real traffic traces, the experimental results show that the proposed approach can efficiently reduce a feature space’s dimensions and deal with the multi-class imbalance and concept drift problems in terms of ML. Furthermore, it can improve the classification performance and have a beneficial classification effect on unknown flows."
Improving Chest X-ray Image Classification via Integration of Self-Supervised Learning and Machine Learning Algorithms,2024,"['Chest X-ray image', 'Contrastive learning', 'Image classification', 'Self-supervised learning']",,"In this study, we present a novel approach for enhancing chest X-ray image classification (normal, Covid-19, edema, massnodules, and pneumothorax) by combining contrastive learning and machine learning algorithms. A vast amount of unlabeleddata was leveraged to learn representations so that data efficiency is improved as a means of addressing the limited availabilityof labeled data in X-ray images. Our approach involves training classification algorithms using the extracted features from alinear fine-tuned Momentum Contrast (MoCo) model. The MoCo architecture with a Resnet34, Resnet50, or Resnet101backbone is trained to learn features from unlabeled data. Instead of only fine-tuning the linear classifier layer on the MoCopretrainedmodel, we propose training nonlinear classifiers as substitutes for softmax in deep networks. The empirical resultsshow that while the linear fine-tuned ImageNet-pretrained models achieved the highest accuracy of only 82.9% and the linearfine-tuned MoCo-pretrained models an increased highest accuracy of 84.8%, our proposed method offered a significantimprovement and achieved the highest accuracy of 87.9%."
Supervised Learning in Model Reference Adaptive Sliding Mode Control,2024,"['Adaptive control', 'adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC)', 'back-propagation algorithm', 'chattering reduction', 'model reference adaptive control (MRAC)', 'online learning algorithms.']",,"The well known back-propagation algorithm has revolutionized machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly in neural network applications. Although gradient descent-based algorithms are utilized in control applications, they are not as prevalent as in neural network applications. This discrepancy can be attributed to the successful development of various adaptation laws which ensure system stability while meeting the required design criteria. Many of these laws can be found in model reference adaptive control (MRAC) and adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC). This paper investigates the applicability of the Brandt-Lin (B-L) learning algorithm, mathematically equivalent to the back-propagation algorithm, in adaptive control applications. We find that combining the B-L learning algorithm with SMC yields a robust controller suitable for model reference adaptive sliding mode control (MRA-SMC). The controller is applicable to linear and a class of nonlinear dynamic systems and is suitable for efficient implementation. We derive the stability criteria for this controller and conduct simulations to study the adaptation’s impact on chattering. Our work exemplifies one approach to adopt the back-propagation algorithm in control applications."

Tokamak plasma disruption precursor onset time study based on semi-supervised anomaly detection,2024,"['Tokamak', 'Disruption prediction', 'Machine learning', 'Anomaly detection', 'Precursor onset time']",,"Plasma disruption in tokamak experiments is a challenging issue that causes damage to the device. Reliable prediction methods are needed, but the lack of full understanding of plasma disruption limits the effectiveness of physics-driven methods. Data-driven methods based on supervised learning are commonly used, and they rely on labelled training data. However, manual labelling of disruption precursors is a time-consuming and challenging task, as some precursors are difficult to accurately identify. The mainstream labelling methods assume that the precursor onset occurs at a fixed time before disruption, which leads to mislabeled samples and suboptimal prediction performance. In this paper, we present disruption prediction methods based on anomaly detection to address these issues, demonstrating good prediction performance on J-TEXT and EAST. By evaluating precursor onset times using different anomaly detection algorithms, it is found that labelling methods can be improved since the onset times of different shots are not necessarily the same. The study optimizes precursor labelling using the onset times inferred by the anomaly detection predictor and test the optimized labels on supervised learning disruption predictors. The results on J-TEXT and EAST show that the models trained on the optimized labels outperform those trained on fixed onset time labels."

Deep Learning Applied Abnormal Human Behavior Detection in Video Surveillance Systems - A Survey,2024,"['Abnormal Human Behavior Detection', 'Abnormal Human Activity Recognition', 'Anomaly Detection', 'Video Surveillance', 'Deep learning']",,"As society develops, the demand for security is rapidly increasing. Accordingly, there is growing interest in research on methods to detect and prevent abnormal behavior using surveillance cameras in public places and private spaces such as shopping malls and airports for human safety. Many detection techniques based on deep learning models have been researched in the field of abnormal behavior detection. However, due to the lack of labeled abnormal behavior data, there are significant difficulties in developing an effective detection system. This paper surveys methods for deep learning methods to detect abnormal human behavior in surveillance video and presents recent techniques. First, I will introduce popular datasets that have often been used in previous research. After that, we categorized the existing methods for detecting abnormal behavior using deep learning into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and partially-supervised learning. We then explained the basic concepts and advantages of each method and summarized their shortcomings. We also briefly describe future research directions based on the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Based on this, it is expected that the technology of video surveillance systems that apply abnormal behavior detection will further develop."
A Two-Step Channel Mask Method for Data Augmentation in Contrastive Learning-Based Human Activity Recognition,2024,"['Data Augmentation', 'Mask', 'Human Activity Recognition', 'Contrastive Learning', 'Sensor']",,"Contrastive learning, which is an effective self-supervised deep learning paradigm, learns activity representation by contrasting sample views created by varying data with augmentation methods. Human activity sensor data from various sensors are characterized by both time and channel dimensions. Several augmentation methods, such as resampling, noise, and scaling, have been proved to be highly effective. However, all of these methods solely vary in data with respect to the dimension of time, and thus cannot create sample views from the dimension of channel. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to vary data in the dimension of channel with the masking strategy, being inspired by its success in computer vision and natural language processing. In particular, we conceive a new augmentation method called the two-step channel mask (TCM), which is clear to implement and varies data in both said dimensions by combining the existing augmentation methods and the strategy of masking random channels. We use two contrastive learning frameworks, namely SimCLR and BYOL, as well as two backbones, namely fully convolutional network (FCN) and DeepConvLSTM (DCL), to evaluate this method on several popular benchmark datasets. From the experimental results, we found that the methods varying data in different dimensions can be complementary and perform well in contrastive learning for human activity recognition."
Development of Machine Learning-Based Energy Management Agent to Control Fine Dust Concentration in Railway Stations,2024,['Constrained deep-Q network  · Energy management agent  · Particulate matter  · Reinforcement learning  · Supervised learning'],,"This paper introduces a new strategy for managing energy consumption by employing a constrained deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to regulate Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. The strategy is grounded in the principles of the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which allows for the creation of a transition kernel. By utilizing an artifi cial neural network (ANN), we can predict levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 based on the given conditions and actions. This prediction helps in forming the transition kernel within the MDP framework. Using this predictive model as the transition kernel, we optimize the control policy of the energy management agent through the constrained DQN technique. This technique ensures that actions remain within specifi c constraints. We validate the eff ectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments using real data collected from Namgwangju Station. These experiments demonstrate that the introduced constraints successfully keep PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels within predefi ned thresholds at the stations.

Improve the Performance of Semi-Supervised Side-channel Analysis Using HWFilter Method,2024,"['Side-channel analysis', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'Hamming weight', 'Pseudo-label filter', 'Normal distribution']",,"Side-channel analysis (SCA) is a cryptanalytic technique that exploits physical leakages, such as power consumption or electromagnetic emanations, from cryptographic devices to extract secret keys used in cryptographic algorithms. Recent studies have shown that training SCA models with semi-supervised learning can effectively overcome the problem of few labeled power traces. However, the process of training SCA models using semi-supervised learning generates many pseudo-labels. The performance of the SCA model can be reduced by some of these pseudo-labels. To solve this issue, we propose the HWFilter method to improve semi-supervised SCA. This method uses a Hamming Weight Pseudo-label Filter (HWPF) to filter the pseudo-labels generated by the semi-supervised SCA model, which enhances the model's performance. Furthermore, we introduce a normal distribution method for constructing the HWPF. In the normal distribution method, the Hamming weights (HWs) of power traces can be obtained from the normal distribution of power points. These HWs are filtered and combined into a HWPF. The HWFilter was tested using the ASCADv1 database and the AES_HD dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the HWFilter method can significantly enhance the performance of semi-supervised SCA models. In the ASCADv1 database, the model with HWFilter requires only 33 power traces to recover the key. In the AES_HD dataset, the model with HWFilter outperforms the current best semi-supervised SCA model by 12%."
Scoping review: exploring residents’ views of supervisor entrustment and its effect on learning and professional development,2024,"['Entrustment', 'Supervision', 'Residents', 'Perception', 'Medical education']",,"This scoping review aimed to systematically explore the complex and nuanced perceptions of residents entrusted with significant responsibilities by their supervisors in the clinical context. We conducted a comprehensive search strategy targeting six major electronic databases. Data were extracted using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist and a scoping review protocol. Resident perceptions regarding entrustment and its impact on learning and professional development were categorized. This review elucidated the role of supervisor entrustment in shaping residents’ clinical performance, notably influencing autonomy, self-confidence, responsibility for patients, learning needs and goals, uncertainty management, and professional identity formation. Residents identified factors that promote and hinder performance and entrustment development resulting from supervisor entrustment and distinguished between appropriate supervision and over- or under-supervision. Our review suggests that residents’ perceptions of supervisor entrustment, as bestowed by supervisors, serves as a catalyst for enhancing autonomy, thereby exerting a significant influence on clinical performance, and fostering the development of a professional identity. However, residents’ views on appropriate supervision differ in some ways from supervisors’ perspectives. Further research is needed to bridge the gap between residents’ expectations of autonomy and what they are given, and to explore the intricate relationship between autonomy and entrustment."
Breast Cancer Classification in Ultrasound Images using Semi-supervised method based on Pseudo-labeling,2024,"['deep learning', 'semi-supervised method', 'breast cancer', 'classification.']",,"Breast cancer classification using ultrasound, while widely employed, faces challenges due to its relatively low predictive value arising from significant overlap in characteristics between benign and malignant lesions, as well as operator-dependency. To alleviate these challenges and reduce dependency on radiologist interpretation, the implementation of automatic breast cancer classification in ultrasound image can be helpful. To deal with this problem, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning framework for breast cancer classification. In the proposed method, we could achieve reasonable performance utilizing less than 50% of the training data for supervised learning in comparison to when we utilized a 100% labeled dataset for training. Though it requires more modification, this methodology may be able to alleviate the time-consuming annotation burden on radiologists by reducing the number of annotation, contributing to a more efficient and effective breast cancer detection process in ultrasound images."

ANER systems can often be classified into three major groups: rule-based, Machine Learning (ML), and hybrid. This study focuses on examining ML-based ANER developments, particularly in the context of Classical Arabic, which presents unique challenges due to its complex morphological structure and limited linguistic resources. We propose a supervised approach that integrates word-level, morphological, and knowledge-based features to improve NER performance for Classical Arabic. Our method was evaluated on the CANERCorpus, a specialized dataset containing annotated texts from Classical Arabic literature. The Naive Bayes (NB) approach achieved an F-measure of 80%, with precision and recall levels at 86% and 75%, respectively. These results indicate a significant improvement over traditional methods, particularly in dealing with the intricate structure of Classical Arabic. The study highlights the potential of ML in overcoming the challenges of ANER and provides directions for further research in this domain."
KHG-Aclair: Knowledge Hypergraph-Based Attention with Contrastive Learning for Recommendations,2024,"['Recommendation system', 'Self-supervised learning', 'Contrastive learning', 'Knowledge hypergraph', 'Knowledge graph']",,"Information overload and complex user interactions make it difficult to retrieve valuable data. Recommendation systems have become crucial in addressing this challenge by providing users with relevant information and items. Collaborative filtering-based recommendation methods, which are commonly used in this context, often suffer from data scarcity, thus limiting their effectiveness for users with insufficient interaction data. To overcome this problem, knowledge graphs have been integrated into recommendation systems to enhance user and item representation through the implementation of additional semantic relatedness. Despite their potential utility, most recommendation models assume binary relations within knowledge graphs, thereby overlooking the high-order relationships that are prevalent in knowledge graphs. Knowledge hypergraphs, which can capture complex and multi-dimensional relationships, offer a solution to this limitation. This paper proposes KHG-Aclair, a novel recommendation system that leverages hypergraphs to uncover hidden features within knowledge graphs, thus enhancing recommendation accuracy and insight. We have transformed the Freebase knowledge graph into a knowledge hypergraph and made this dataset publicly available. KHG-Aclair also incorporates contrastive learning to refine the knowledge hypergraph, thus reducing noise and improving representation for less popular items. Altogether, our model demonstrates strong generalizability, as it achieves high performance across multiple datasets, thus indicating that it can serve as a versatile solution for various recommendation systems. Our implementation codes are available at https://github.com/HBD-NGC1316/KHG-Aclair."

This research took two state universities in Bangladesh as case studies, using a qualitative methodology. Researchers conducted 10 Key Informant Interviews, with professors and field supervisors, 20 in‐depth interviews with Master of Social Sciences (MSS) students and two Focus Group Discussions with MSS students. During the pandemic, University faculty experimented with virtual classrooms, pre‐recorded lectures, and online chat forums to interact with postgraduate students. However, these approaches were not completely successful due to the limitations of digital infrastructure at the Universities and at students' residences. Shortcomings in virtual education included technological barriers, insufficient access to educational resources, and an unusual mental health situation for many students. Student practica were difficult to organize, due to technological barriers, restricted field placement opportunities, disruption in client interaction, and community outreach, interruptions in fieldwork and data collection, as well as insufficient faculty supervision and support. Universities ought to take proactive measures to integrate technology into teaching and learning in normal times so that both can continue during public health emergencies without adding educational crisis to the general state of emergency."

Automatic crack detection using quantum-inspired firefly algorithm with deep learning techniques,2024,"['bituminous pavements', 'deep learning', 'multi-scale fusion', 'object detection', 'road crack detection', 'self-supervised learning', 'vision transformers']",,"Detecting and quantifying cracks in bituminous (asphalt) road surfaces plays a crucial role in maintaining road infrastructure integrity and enabling cost-effective maintenance strategies. However, traditional manual inspections are laborious, time-intensive, and susceptible to inconsistencies due to factors like human fatigue, varying expertise levels, and subjective assessments. To address these challenges, this research proposes CrackNet, an innovative deep learning framework that harnesses state-of-the-art computer vision and object detection techniques for accurate and computationally efficient automated crack detection in bituminous road imagery. CrackNet introduces a novel hybrid neural network architecture that seamlessly integrates a cutting-edge Vision Transformer backbone with multi-scale convolutional feature fusion modules. The Vision Transformer component excels at capturing long-range structural dependencies and global contextual information, while the multi-scale fusion modules adeptly combine fine-grained crack details across various spatial resolutions. This unique design enables CrackNet to holistically model intricate crack topologies while preserving localized characteristics and intricate details. To further bolster robustness and generalization capabilities across diverse real-world scenarios, CrackNet incorporates self-supervised pre-training techniques that leverage unlabeled data and unsupervised pretext tasks. These strategies allow CrackNet to learn rich visual representations tailored specifically for crack detection. Additionally, an extensive data augmentation pipeline is employed, encompassing geometric, photometric, and adversarial transformations, to enhance model invariance to varying imaging conditions and environmental factors. The accuracy achieved by the newly proposed approach surpasses that of current state-of-the-art methodologies, reaching an impressive 97.8%."

Gamma emission tomography (GET) has been used to inspect partial-defects at the pin-by-pin level through the acquisition of tomographic images. However, due to the high density of nuclear fuel rods, GET shows relatively low accuracy for the central region. This study proposes an image reconstruction method for the internal fuels based on Monte Carlo simulation and machine learning algorithm. The gammas from the SNF were measured with the GET device and the sinograms were reconstructed with Maximum-Likelihood Expectation- Maximization (MLEM) with prior-aware information of SNF, and image quality was improved with the machine learning technique. Our results show that the MLEM with prior-aware information could dramatically improve the image quality and the denoising technique with the machine learning could clearly correct the over-and under-estimation. Based on the results of quantitative validation of the proposed reconstruction method, the pattern classification accuracy was calculated to be about 100 %. These techniques enabled the image acquisition of the central fuel rod and increased accuracy in partial defect detection. For further study, the performance of the proposed reconstruction method will be evaluated based on the experiment data."

After collecting the data about the road conditions, various machine learning approaches, such as supervised, multi-layered, and multiclass, are applied to data filtration. Road conditions are divided into three categories to achieve this methodology: potholes, deep traverse cracks, and smooth roads. This categorization helped in analyzing the road surface condition through smartphone sensors over all three axes instead of taking it over a single axis.

Currently, defect pattern classification in WBM is manually performed by industry engineers, posing challenges in terms of time and cost. To address this issue, research utilizing semi supervised learning is underway. A prominent approach involves pseudo labeling, which involves utilizing a small set of labeled data for supervised learning, generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and then retraining the model using both the pseudo labels and labeled data.

The framework utilizes an LK-Encoder, which is composed of four serially connected 1-D CNN-based hidden layer blocks, and applies semi-supervised learning to set a threshold in the feature space for distinguishing between normal and damaged vibration data, thereby enabling damage detection from vibration data. To validate this approach, the study assumed damage scenarios by varying the thickness of shear building columns, and damage detection was conducted using the proposed framework. Results showed an accuracy of 97.03% for large damage condition. When the dataset of the normal condition was increased fourfold, small damage was detected with an accuracy of 99.66%. Additionally, it was confirmed that even when the model was trained with different types of damage from the target detection, increasing the amount of normal data improved damage detection accuracy. These results indicate that the proposed framework effectively detects even minor damage, which is difficult to identify through natural frequency analysis, with high accuracy."

Various deep learning models have been developed to help TOF-MRA reading in the field. The performance of those TOF-MRA analysis tools, however, faces several limitations in cerebral aneurysm detection. These challenges primarily come from the fact that cerebral aneurysms occupy less than 0.1% of the total TOF-MRA voxel size. This study aims to improve the efficiency of cerebral aneurysm detection by developing a landmark-based semi-supervised deep learning method, a technology that automatically generates landmark boxes in areas with a high probability of cerebral aneurysm occurrence.Methods: We used data from a total of 500 aneurysm-positive and 50 aneurysm-negative subjects. The aneurysm detection model was developed using clustering and a dilated residual network.Results: When the number of landmarks was ten and their size was 36 mm3, the best performance was achieved in our experiment. Although landmark occupies a small portion of the entire image, up to 98.2% of landmarks were cerebral aneurysms. The sensitivity of the model for cerebral aneurysm detection was 83.0%, with a false positive rate of 3.4%.Conclusions: This study developed a deep learning model using TOF-MRA image. This model generates the most suitable landmarks for each individual, excluding unnecessary areas for cerebral aneurysm detection, which makes it possible to focus on areas with a high probability of occurrence. This model is expected to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of cerebral aneurysm detection in the field."

These approaches require label information during training, which can be both tedious and expensive to obtain. As a result, there is a growing interest in self-supervised learning methods that use only relational data between elements, eliminating the need for labels. One such method is Graphical Mutual Information (GMI), which has proven effective in embedding each node based on its characteristics. However, GMI has a limitation: it solely relies on direct connection information, which hinders its ability to learn the global cluster structure of graphs. To overcome this limitation, our research proposes the Marginal Node Indicator method, which leverages the graph's cluster structure in the learning process.

The study involved one researcher, three pre-service supervisors, and seven novice play therapists. Qualitative data was collected through in-depth interviews, participant observation, and reflective journals, utilizing causal chain analysis and multiple case analysis methods. As a result of this study, it revealed ways to improve identified issues through the cooperative process between the researcher and pre-service supervisors. Additionally, the analysis of changes among pre-service supervisors and novice play therapists identified two main categories (communication, growth) and five sub-categories (perfect supervisor, good enough supervisor, progressing toward a play therapy supervisor, growth of novice play therapists, mutual growth as play therapists). These results suggest that the professional learning community-based action learning play therapy model could serve as an alternative training approach to enhance the educational expertise of pre-service supervisors."

Most of them are unsupervised DA methods and popular adversarial approaches are known to have best performance among them. But, we have found out that adversarial approaches have an unstable problem that is the performance critically depends on the starting weights of the deep-learning networks. Furthermore, unsupervised DA methods could get a limited performance improvement if domain shift is larger than some extent. This paper proposes a supervised DA method based on AdaBoost with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as base estimators. The proposed approach is effective when target domain data is much smaller than source domain data. On a publically accessible dataset, the proposed methodology is tested, and when compared to previous unsupervised domain adaption prediction methods, it reaches state-of-the-art prediction performance."

Traditional methods rely on epipolar geometry to construct cost volumes, but they have two major drawbacks: (1) they assume a static environment and (2) they require pose information during inference. Consequently, these methods struggle in real-world scenarios with dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose using the cross-attention map as a comprehensive cost volume to address these limitations. We show that training the cross-attention layers for image reconstruction enables implicit learning of a warping function, similar to the explicit epipolar warping in conventional methods.

A homography matrix that transforms the scale, rotation, and translation of a single VHR remote-sensing image is applied to generate reference and sensed image patches. After adjusting the contrast and brightness of the sensed image patch, Gaussian and speckle noise are added, and shading and motion blur effects are applied to give it different characteristics from the reference image patch. Subsequently, multiple feature point extractors are combined with homographic adaptation to extract robustly detected feature points by different detectors under various geometric conditions from each image patch. The extracted feature points are optimized using the non-maximum suppression (NMS) technique. Feature point pairs with distance errors within 1 pixel between image patches are identified as matching points using the inverse homography matrix. The coordinates of these matching points, along with the homography matrix, are then employed as pseudo-labels. Training data was generated only when the automated method, applied to the VHR remote sensing database collected from various sources, extracted more than 20 matching points. As a result, training and validation datasets were generated, comprising a total of 341,820 and 44,389 image patches, respectively. The End-to-end matching network trained with the proposed dataset extracted matching points more accurately compared to other matching methods and deep learning networks.

By quantifying the impact of these variables on consumer opinion evaluation, the study aims to establish an effective online communication strategy for organization-public relations.Methods To measure the effect of communication between consumers and doctors/hospitals on their evaluation, we utilized vitals.com, an online hospital review site in the US. From September 1 to September 8, 2023, we gathered 12,945 reviews for a total of 7,218 doctors from different specialties and hospital locations. By employing a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, we extracted variables from the collected social big data and estimated their effects.Results When considering the total rating as the dependent variable and controlling for factors such as doctors’ characteristics (experience, number of languages, specialties, detailed fields, number of certificates, treatment attitudes), hospital characteristics (number of insurance, waiting times, speed of treatment, employee kindness, number of ratings and reviews), and review content characteristics (number of words used in the review, sentiment of the review), it was found that dialogic communication had a positive impact on the total rating. Furthermore, it was noted that dialogic communication was particularly effective in cases where hospitals and doctors had less experience with negative evaluations related to treatment speed, treatment attitude, and employee kindness.Conclusions This study confirmed the effectiveness of organization-public dialogic communication in the realm of online information search and health communication. It employed the latest techniques and included the largest sample size to date, with a total of 13,000 participants. Additionally, the study unveiled the role of organization-public dialogic communication in influencing the decision-making process of medical consumers, based on the accessibility-diagnosis model. Furthermore, the study utilized machine learning methodology to develop an algorithm that can automatically determine whether reviews are related to organization-public dialogic communication, rather than relying on self-report data. These findings emphasize the importance of organization-public dialogic communication from the perspective of PR practitioners. It suggests that communication aspects sometimes carry more weight in consumers’ judgments of hospitals/doctors than characteristics such as employee kindness, number of specialties, and number of certificates."

The improved K-means clustering makes it possible to move toward better outcome values even when the center of cluster no longer change. In the conventional clustering method, the center of the cluster moves to the center of the data belonging to the cluster, and clustering ends when the cluster does not change, so other characteristics other than the center value are excluded. Unlike the conventional clustering method, the improved clustering method uses a central value, an average value, and a random value as variables, and a particle swarm optimization algorithm that modifies the vector for each iteration is applied. As a result, improved clustering method derived a better result value than the existing clustering method in the group's fitness index, silhouette score."

Non-Destructive Testing of Laser Welded Hydrogen Storage Tank Liner Using Optical Coherence Tomography,2024,"['Optical coherence tomography', 'NDT', 'Laser welding', 'Hydrogen storage tank', 'Defect detection', 'Deep learning']",,"The Type 4 hydrogen storage tank has an internal liner made of polymer material. Instead of the joining of two cylinder-shaped liners through butt-joint thermal fusion bonding, a faster joining can be achieved through lap-joint laser welding. Non-destructive testing is required to inspect the quality of laser-welded areas and to detect pore defects. In this study, the interface of a laser-welded region is investigated using optical coherence tomography to detect internal pore defects, where the maximum thickness of the liner is found to be approximately 3 mm. Optical coherence tomography images with defects are then used for supervised YOLOv2 deep learning. Real-time detection of internal defects is successfully performed on laser-welded liner samples."

First, after reviewing previous studies on spiritual direction in Korean churches, a prayer meeting plan was proposed to strengthen the experience of prayer, which is the main content of spiritual direction. Since it is not possible to share prayer experiences during the early morning prayers, it would be desirable to have a separate prayer meeting like a Bible study. If it is difficult to hold a separate prayer meeting, the prayer meeting can be held during the Sunday afternoon service or Wednesday service. Except Tongseong Prayer, six methods were proposed as new methods of prayer. In general, believers devote themselves to a life of prayer when they feel spiritual need, so I proposed prayer methods related to the interests of believers in modern society, such as healing the stressful heart, introspection, blessed life and the death in dignity, and pro-natural life. First, a prayer offered through the Psalms of lamentation for the healing of the mind, second, a prayer offered through the questionnaire practiced by John Wesley to reflect on consciousness, third, a prayer offered by reading Psalm 90 for a blessed life and death, and fourth, Christian natural contemplative prayer was presented. In addition to these prayers, the classic contemplative prayer methods, the Lectio Divina Prayer and the Jesus Prayer were introduced.  Next, I looked at group spiritual direction. Due to the urgency of providing priority guidance to believers who are still interested in a life of prayer, I only looked at group spiritual direction. Lastly, I examined how pastors who provide spiritual direction can receive spiritual direction supervision. To this end, it was proposed to participate and learn in spiritual direction meetings or to hold supervision meetings among colleagues in spiritual direction ministry. If these were not possible, it was also suggested to rely on the guidance of the Holy Spirit on one’s own. In addition, it was suggested that exploration of psychology is also recommended to improve psychological discernment."

Two different approaches were attempted. First, we built a supervised classification model that uses BERT-based contextual vectors and character similarity features of herbal formula mentions in medical texts to determine whether two mentions are identical. Second, we applied a prompt-based querying method using GPT-4o mini and GPT-4o to perform the same task. Both methods achieved over 0.9 in Precision, Recall, and F1-score, with the GPT-4o-based approach demonstrating the highest Precision and F1-Score. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning-based approaches for named entity normalization in traditional medicine texts, with the GPT-4o-based method showing superior performance. This suggests its potential as a valuable foundation for the development of intelligent information extraction systems in the traditional medicine domain."
A Gain Scheduling Attitude Controller With NN Supervisor for Quadrotor UAVs,2024,"['Agile maneuver', 'attitude control', 'gain scheduling control', 'quadrotor helicopter', 'RBFNN-supervisor.']",,"The use of quadrotor helicopters is highly demanded in both military and commercial fields. Depending on the application area, special requirements may be needed for the maneuverability of these unmanned aerial vehicles. Traditional controller structures cannot meet these demands, leading developers to seek innovative solutions. In this study, a gain-scheduling controller is proposed to maintain the performance requirements for the attitude control of quadrotor helicopters. In this context, different operating points are selected based on a proposed rule in the working region of the quadrotor helicopter, and a controller design is carried out after a necessary transformation of the linear models. Furthermore, the robustness of quadrotors against time-varying disturbances is ensured through the implementation of a supervisor neural network (NN) controller. Specifically, a radial basis function NN (RBFNN) is employed, trained using gradient descent-based supervised learning. The response of the proposed controller is compared numerically with the traditional proportional-derivative controller’s response, where the proposed controller, which is not so different from conventional controllers in terms of processor power, provides the desired performance criteria in a wide operating region. Finally, the gain-scheduling controller improved with the feedforward NN controller is tested under time-varying disturbances, resulting in a significant reduction in errors."

In this regard, this study aims to improve the qualification management of healthy family specialists through a practicum experience of social welfare students undergoing training to become experts in this field. For this research, in-depth interviews with 14 university students majoring in social welfare were conducted, and the data were qualitatively analyzed. This paper presents the results of the study as follows. First, most of the participants, the practicum meant fulfilling a requirement for obtaining a healthy family specialist certificate for employment. After the practicum, they said that it helped them understand the practice at the Family Center, and they showed changes in their perceptions, such as considering the Family Center a prospective place of employment. Second, the practical experiences of the participants differed among the centers where they had their practicum but provided a good opportunity to gain for field training overall. However, many trainees pointed out the lack of systematic practice guidelines and professional supervision. Third, the participants' requests to their university included the issuance of formal healthy family specialist certificates, the mandatory practice subjects, and the systematization of pre-practice guidelines. Finally, there was a demand for systematic practice guidelines and the faithfulness of supervision at the centers. Based on these findings, suggestions were made for strengthening the qualification management of healthy family specialists. First of all, it was suggested that the Practicum Experience for healthy families should be essential for completing the qualification for healthy families, and formal training guidelines should be established to provide systematic supervision. In addition, above all, it will be necessary to reduce confusion among the training field and trainees by making sure that the Healthy Family Certificate is officially issued at the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family."

Data were obtained from the Korea Welfare Panel Study Supplementary Survey on Children.Analysis was conducted using the Multilevel Growth Model to examine the cognitive and emotional development trajectories of students throughout their elementary, middle, and high school years.Results: In terms of cognitive development, the study found that teacher support within the psychosocial school environment positively influenced the growth rate of Korean language subject grades. Regarding emotional growth, factors such as teacher support, school atmosphere, and peer relationships within the psychosocial school environment all exhibited significant positive effects on the initial levels of self-esteem among elementary school students. Additionally, the school atmosphere positively impacted the growth rate of self-esteem. The negative impact of poverty was often diminished or mitigated with the inclusion of variables such as students’ learning attitudes and parental educational involvement and supervision. Furthermore, with the additional inclusion of psychosocial school environment variables, the adverse effects of poverty almost completely disappeared. However, the influence of poverty persisted, manifesting as a negative impact on the initial scores of English subject grades.Conclusion: The psychosocial school environment can positively contribute to students' cognitive and emotional development. Particularly, teacher support has a positive impact on both the cognitive and emotional growth of students, and school climate and peer relationships are positively associated with emotional development. Therefore, efforts should be made in schools to strengthen teacher support, and to foster a positive school climate and peer relationships, aiming for a positive direction in cognitive and emotional development."

To demonstrate the possibility of mutual utilization between these two domains, this study first examined the similarities between key concepts in the mind study of Yang-ming studies and Mind Humanities. The comparison of Wang's theory of Zhiliangzhi (致良知) with the integrated model of mind study in Mind Humanities was then conducted.Liangzhi(良知) can be understood in three aspects within the structure of consciousness: supervising the good and evil of thoughts through its empty and clear nature, making judgments of right and wrong, and driving the removal of evil intentions while promoting good ones. Mind Humanities, based on existing insights into the mind, understands the mind in three structures: the original mind, the “I am” mind, and the “I do” mind. We found similarities between the empty and clear nature of Zhiliangzhi(致良知) and the intrinsic awareness of the original mind, particularly in their empty attributes and illuminating functions. Additionally, the three characteristics of the mind-neither good nor evil, capable of good and evil, and choosing good while discarding evil-can be compared from the perspective of Wang’s four-sentence teaching.Furthermore, this study examined the methodology of Zhiliangzhi(致良知) in Wang’s “Inquiries on the Great Learning” and explored the integrated model of mind study in terms of nature, phenomenon, and practice. The concept of Zhiliangzhi(致良知), where the innate knowledge itself governs the practice, is comparable to the emphasis on intrinsic awareness as the subject of mind study in the integrated model. Moreover, the practice of Zhiliangzhi(致良知), which involves distinguishing between good and evil intentions based on innate knowledge’s ability to judge right and wrong, and subsequently practicing good while removing evil, aligns with the integrated model’s approach of accepting and analyzing phenomena, discerning right from wrong, and implementing righteous actions while rejecting unjust ones.Mind Humanities is developing and applying various programs based on the integrated model of mind study. The similarities between the two approaches suggest the possibility of developing programs based on the theory of ZhiLiangzhi(致良知), potentially offering a new way to address current real-world problems and respond to societal demands."

In this paper, we consider a hierarchical structure across multiple related tasks with a hierarchy of sub-tasks under the same main task, where representations used to solve the sub-tasks share more information through task-specific layers, globally shared layers, and locally shared layers. We thus propose the hierarchical multi-task learning with self-supervised auxiliary task (HiSS), which is a novel approach for hierarchical multi-task learning that incorporates self-supervised learning as an auxiliary task. The goal of the auxiliary task is to further extract latent information from the unlabeled data by predicting a cluster label directly derived from the data. The proposed approach is tested on the Hyodoll dataset, which consists of user information and activity logs of elderly individuals collected by AI companion robots, for predicting emergency calls based on the time of day and month. Our proposed algorithm is more efficient than other wellknown machine learning algorithms as it requires only a single model regardless of the number of tasks, and demonstrates superior performance in classification tasks using various metrics.

Thermal imaging cameras capture and store thermal images of each product for measuring the transverse temperature variations, which can cause defects in steel pipe manufacturing. To mitigate this risk, thermal defect images are manually classified by individuals. However, classifications by human rely heavily on experience, leading to differences among classifiers. Thus, there is a need for a model capable of automatically classifying transverse temperature images in the hot rolling process. Labeling these thermal images for model training pose a challenge because of the time-intensive nature. To address this challenge and ensure good performance, we propose using a semi-supervised learning approach that leverages both labeled and unlabeled images for actual steel manufacturing data. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply semi-supervised learning to classify thermal defect images of steel products. The proposed model achieves outstanding performance with an F1-Score of 0.9608 even when trained using only 50% of the labeled data.

To address this issue, this study aims to enhance the performance of semi-supervised learning in colonoscopy polyp detection by utilizing data augmentation techniques. Three methods are proposed: first, adding different generated images to labeled and unlabeled data separately; second, applying the Copy-Paste technique to the first method, thereby doubling the amount of data; third, adding the same generated images to both labeled and unlabeled data and applying the Copy-Paste technique. Experimental results showed that all three methods improved performance compared to existing semi-supervised learning approaches, with the method of adding different generated images to labeled and unlabeled data along with Copy-Paste augmentation demonstrating the most significant performance improvement."

In such areas, the use of multi-legged robots with lower ground contact is more suitable. However, there is a lack of research on robot control mechanisms capable of responding quickly to unexpected situations like leg loss in multi-legged robots. This study focuses on developing control models and reinforcement learning strategies to enable rapid adaptation to leg loss during the movement of multi-legged robots designed for mine detection. The MA-POCA(Multi Agent-Posthumous Credit Assignment) algorithm, one of multi-agent algorithms in reinforcement learning, is employed for this purpose. Additionally, a simulation model and environment are created using Unity and the ML-Agents library to facilitate the rapid learning of unforeseen damage scenarios during robot operations in the DMZ. To address this challenge, each agent within the multi-agent group is assigned to control one leg of the multi-legged robot and is trained as an independent agent using CTDE (Centralized Training via Decentralized Estimation). This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional supervised learning methods and is empirically shown to be effective. Notably, the article highlights that the gait developed using the MA-POCA algorithm, focusing on control and reinforcement learning for lost legs during walking, distinguishes itself from other algorithms primarily focused on multi-legged robot locomotion. This unique approach allows for adaptation to critical situations that may occur during mine-clearance operations in the DMZ, suggesting potential improvements in mission efficiency, particularly in rapidly changing situations."

This paper proposes an unsupervised manufacturing fault detection method based on self-labeled training to remedy the lack of properly labeled datasets. The proposed method comprises a two-step process of time-series imaging, termed fingerprinting, and normality calculation using self-labeled classification in a deep learning architecture. We compared our model with state-of-art one-class classification algorithms using an unlabeled dataset, which was obtained by varying the ratio of production failure samples in datasets. The proposed model exhibited better performance than baseline algorithms in terms of area under receiver operating curve (AUROC), even for the one-class classification using datasets comprising production success cases only. Moreover, more robust performance was observed compared to the baseline algorithms in several contamination conditions of datasets where the datasets comprised different proportions of production failure cases to simulate unlabeled manufacturing data. Our results suggest that the self-labeling-based fault detection model we propose is adaptable to both unsupervised and semi-supervised conditions. It can effectively enhance the detection of defects in scenarios characterized by exceptionally rare failure cases that closely resemble real-world situations."

After completing the program, the trained resident performed spinal fusion surgery with robotic assistance under the supervision of a mentor. The clinical outcomes and learning curve associated with robotic surgery were then analyzed.Results: Neurosurgical residents had limited opportunities to participate in spinal surgery during their training. Despite this, there was a significant interest in the emerging field of robotic surgery. A trained resident performed RASS under the supervision of a senior surgeon. A total of 166 screw insertions were attempted in 28 patients, with 2 screws failing due to skiving. According to the Gertzbein-Robbins classification, 85.54% of the screws were rated as grade A, 11.58% as grade B, 0.6% as grade C, and 1.2% as grade D. The clinical acceptance rate was approximately 96.99%, which is comparable to the results reported by senior experts and time per screw statistically significantly decreased as experience was gained.Conclusion: RASS can be performed with high accuracy within a relatively short timeframe, if residents receive adequate training."

This phenomenon necessitates moving beyond the categorical judgments by analyzing pronunciation using units more granular than phonemes. While previous studies proposed phonemic posterior-grams (PPG) in this context, these features remain tied to a categorical framework when derived through phonemic association. This study employs Wav2Vec2.0 code vectors as an alternative description unit, granted that the self-supervised learning (SSL) representation is free from external phonemic stipulation. We first evaluate whether code vectors encode L1 and L2 speech differently and use them to identify patterns among categorically identical error samples. To this end, the used inventory in single-speaker data of L1 (CMU ARCTIC) and L2 (L2 ARCTIC) is first compared. Then, substitution errors are selected from our L2 analysis NIA037 data using the model finetuned with TIMIT. For each error type, sub-categorical inspection concerns deriving dominant patterns from corresponding featural sequences and interpreting them using raw code vector clustering results and phoneme-code vector co-occurrence probabilities, both constructed from the L1 reference data TIMIT. The findings revealed that, beyond discerning L2 speech, code vectors can effectively quantify the between-categorical positions of error patterns in the pronunciation spectrum. Specifically, Euclidean distances between pattern vectors reflected phonetically grounded variation phenomena documented in existing L2 literature."
3D Cross-Modal Retrieval Using Noisy Center Loss and SimSiam for Small Batch Training,2024,"['Center Loss', 'Cross-Modal', 'Object Retrieval', 'Representation Learning', 'Self-Supervised Learning', 'Supervised Learning']",,"3D Cross-Modal Retrieval (3DCMR) is a task that retrieves 3D objects regardless of modalities, such as images, meshes, and point clouds. One of the most prominent methods used for 3DCMR is the Cross-Modal Center Loss Function (CLF) which applies the conventional center loss strategy for 3D cross-modal search and retrieval. Since CLF is based on center loss, the center features in CLF are also susceptible to subtle changes in hyperparameters and external inferences. For instance, performance degradation is observed when the batch size is too small. Furthermore, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) used in CLF is unable to adapt to changes in batch size and is vulnerable to data variations that occur during actual inference due to the use of simple Euclidean distance between multi-modal features. To address the problems that arise from small batch training, we propose a Noisy Center Loss (NCL) method to estimate the optimal center features. In addition, we apply the simple Siamese representation learning method (SimSiam) during optimal center feature estimation to compare projected features, making the proposed method robust to changes in batch size and variations in data. As a result, the proposed approach demonstrates improved performance in ModelNet40 dataset compared to the conventional methods."

Unsupervised machine learning techniques can be a new approach to deriving important crash risk indicators. This paper applies a multi-stage methodology using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques systematically to evaluate crash risks. The proposed multi-stage methodology is composed of three stages. In the first stage, select variables that can classify risky and general traffic flow well using K-means clustering and Random forest. The second stage is the combination of variables that were derived in the first stage to construct important variable sets for detecting crash precursors. Lastly, third stage, crash prediction models with variable sets, which are selected from the second step, were developed using the support vector machine method. For the real-time crash prediction model, individual vehicle trajectory data were collected from commercial vehicles and used. As a result of this study, the multi-stage models that include variable selection through a combination of K-means clustering and Random Forest methods improved the predictive performance. This study proposes a new approach to selecting important variables that cannot be found by supervised learning when developing a crash prediction model. It is expected that more crashes can be prevented by performing proactive traffic safety management using the methodology suggested in this study."
Identification of Preeclamptic Placenta in Whole Slide Images Using Artificial Intelligence Placenta Analysis,2024,"['Placenta', 'Preeclampsia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Unsupervised Learning']",,"Background: Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive pregnancy disorder linked to placental dysfunction, often involving pathological lesions like acute atherosis, decidual vasculopathy, accelerated villous maturation, and fibrinoid deposition. However, there is no gold standard for the pathological diagnosis of PE and this limits the ability of clinicians to distinguish between PE and non-PE pregnancies. Recent advances in computational pathology have provided the opportunity to automate pathological analysis for diagnosis, classification, prediction, and prediction of disease progression. In this study, we assessed whether computational pathology could be used to identify PE placentas.Methods: A total of 168 placental whole-slide images (WSIs) of patients from Seoul National University Hospital (comprising 84 PE cases and 84 normal controls) were used for model development and internal validation. For external validation of the model, 76 placental slides (including 38 PE cases and 38 normal controls) were obtained from the Boramae Medical Center (BMC). To establish standard criteria for diagnosing PE and distinguishing it from controls using placental WSIs, patch characteristics and quantification of terminal and intermediate villi were employed. In unsupervised learning, K-means clustering was conducted as a feature obtained through an Auto Encoder to extract the ratio of each cluster for each WSI. For supervised learning, quantitative assessments of the villi were obtained using a U-Net-based segmentation algorithm. The prediction model was developed using an ensemble method and was compared with a clinical feature model developed by using placental size features.Results: Using ensemble modeling, we developed a model to identify PE placentas.The model showed good performance (area under the precision-recall curve [AUPRC], 0.771; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.752–0.790), with 77.3% of sensitivity and 71.1% of specificity, whereas the clinical feature model showed an AUPRC 0.713 (95% CI, 0.694–0.732) with 55.6% sensitivity and 86.8% specificity. External validation of the predictive model employing the BMC-derived set of placental slides also showed good discrimination (AUPRC, 0.725; 95% CI, 0.720–0.730).Conclusion: The proposed computational pathology model demonstrated a strong ability to identify preeclamptic placentas. Computational pathology has the potential to improve the identification of PE placentas."
Anomaly-based Alzheimer's disease detection using entropy-based probability Positron Emission Tomography images,2024,"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'anomaly detection', 'deep learning', 'entropy analysis', 'PET imaging']",,"Deep neural networks trained on labeled medical data face major challenges owing to the economic costs of data acquisition through expensive medical imaging devices, expert labor for data annotation, and large datasets to achieve optimal model performance. The heterogeneity of diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, further complicates deep learning because the test cases may substantially differ from the training data, possibly increasing the rate of false positives. We propose a reconstruction-based self-supervised anomaly detection model to overcome these challenges. It has a dual-subnetwork encoder that enhances feature encoding augmented by skip connections to the decoder for improving the gradient flow. The novel encoder captures local and global features to improve image reconstruction. In addition, we introduce an entropy-based image conversion method. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms benchmark models in anomaly detection and classification using an encoder.

Traditional speech recognition methods often suffer from performance degradation in noisy settings. However, the application of deep neural networks (DNN) has led to significant improvements, enabling more robust and reliable recognition in various industries, including banking, automotive, healthcare, and manufacturing.

Recent studies have reported that EUS-based AI models can facilitate early and more accurate diagnosis than other preexisting methods. This article provides a review of the literature on EUS-based AI studies of pancreatic malignancies."

However, if the probability distribution of general softmax, which changes the weight of selected classes into a probability distribution, is applied to the ensemble as it is, the probability of the class with the highest weight becomes too high value because of the effect of the exponential function in softmax, which reduces the effectiveness of the ensemble. In this paper, we propose smoothed softmax which introduces a smoothing factor to alleviate the problem of softmax, and show that the ensemble performance can be improved. The paper also shows that smoothed softmax improves the accuracy of the neural network when a neural network trained with coarse labels is included in the ensemble, and the ensemble is used as a teacher model to distill knowledge into a small-sized student model neural network. Compared to the conventional softmax, the smoothed softmax proposed in the paper increased the accuracy by 1.38% when it is ensembled with a neural network trained with fine labels, increased the accuracy by 5.21% when a neural network trained with coarse labels was added to the ensemble, and increased the accuracy by up to 7.0% when the ensemble neural network was reduced in size through knowledge distillation."

By utilizing AI, the state can swiftly and efficiently solve increasing public tasks. However, this also heightens the risk of human rights violations due to the advancement of surveillance systems. Thus, it is crucial to assess these risks and establish appropriate countermeasures.When the state uses AI to build a surveillance system, it can automate normative judgments and assessments of individuals, as well as the enforcement of related actions. This can suppress personal autonomy based on human dignity, effectively infringing on individual self-determination and the freedom to act. Moreover, despite the limitations of AI—such as bias and errors—if surveillance and decisions based on it persist, it can undermine the accuracy and objectivity of public task execution, perpetuating unreasonable discrimination. Additionally, as AI collects vast amounts of personal information, it becomes easier to violate the right to informational self-determination and invade privacy. Furthermore, it is challenging to guarantee the right to know about surveillance activities, and AI-powered surveillance can have a chilling effect on freedom of expression.The state must devise normative countermeasures to minimize the risk of human rights violations associated with the development of surveillance systems while still enjoying the benefits of AI. This can be achieved by ensuring that AI-based surveillance adheres to the rule of law. First, AI surveillance must be based on a clear legal foundation. Existing legal frameworks governing public authority must be reviewed comprehensively and revised to fit the AI environment, while establishing new regulatory systems that account for the unique characteristics and risks of AI.When the state uses AI surveillance within the necessary scope, such activities must include mechanisms that ensure transparency, objectivity, and accuracy. Individuals subject to AI surveillance should be informed about such activities, and meaningful access to this information must be guaranteed. Additionally, to prevent AI bias and discrimination, measures should be taken to ensure the quality of the data used, and these measures should be reflected in regulations. Furthermore, before utilizing AI, a suitability and risk assessment should be conducted, and a systematic governance structure must be established within and outside government agencies to enable supervision throughout all phases of AI usage. The state should also establish institutions that can neutrally and objectively evaluate and supervise AI surveillance, while ensuring that individuals have the right to participate in surveillance-related decisions and providing easy and accessible legal remedies against unjust surveillance and decisions."

Intelligent Recognition System of Dangerous  Behaviors Among the Elderly People,2024,"['Behaviors Reconstruction', 'Deep Learning', 'Intelligent Nurse']",,"Clinical data shows that the mortality rate of elderly patients with spinal fractures within one year ranges from 10% to 30%, with a disability rate as high as 50%. More than 50% of falls among elderly people occur in homes that are considered relatively safe, with falls mostly occurring during the morning hours of the day. This trend reminds us that when paying attention to the safety of the elderly, we need to pay special attention to the safety of the family environment and the supervision during the daytime. In this paper, Based on You Only Look Ones (YOLOv8) model infrastructure, combined with deep neck structure and simplified head structure, the system can build high detection accuracy and real-time performance, so that the system can timely detect dangerous behaviors of the elderly people, such as falls. Improve the detection of dangerous behaviors such as falls in real-time and accuracy, which helps reduce the risk of injury caused by delayed detection and treatment, and improve the quality of life of the elderly people. Especially when the elderly live alone or lack the care of guardians, the system can become an ""AI alarm"" and provide all-weather security guard. Experiments show that the detection response time of the system is 275 fps, and the recall rate is 90.2%. And it is linked with the face and behavior identification system, the medical record intelligent matching system of the medical institution, the alarm information transmission system of the communication institution, and the information sharing system of the emergency institution to achieve the emergency response of the elderly who fall at the minute level."

The proposed approach is based on the PatchCore anomaly detection method, which extracts a feature vector containing location information of an image patch from normal image data and calculates the anomaly distance from the normal vector. However, applying PatchCore directly to medical image processing presents challenges due to the possibility of diseases occurring only in specific organs and the presence of image noise unrelated to lesions. In this study, we present an image alignment method that utilizes affine transformation parameter prediction to standardize already captured X-ray images into a specific composition. Additionally, we introduce a region-specific abnormality detection method that requires affine-transformed chest X-ray images. Furthermore, we propose a method to enhance application efficiency and performance through feature map hard masking. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieved a maximum AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic) of 0.774.

Improved Mars Terrain Segmentation in Terms of Style Transfer and Network Architecture,2024,"['Mars segmentation', 'image segmentation', 'style transfer', 'semi-supervised learning']",,"Mars terrain segmentation facilitates full comprehension of Martian terrain and plays an important role in the autonomous planning of Mars rover missions. However, existing methods face several issues. Since Martian terrains vary greatly over different regions, segmentation performance tends to degrade severely because of differences from the training terrain. Furthermore, it becomes necessary to utilize unannotated data due to the difficulty of annotating data as required for the Mars terrain segmentation task. Finally, mis-segmentation of objects frequently occurs. To address these challenges, three key approaches are proposed in this paper: (1) We propose a new neural style transfer method named SA-CCPL, which converts images from source domain style to target domain style without losing the image details. (2) We implement a thing-class and stuff-class perception enhancement (TSPE) module, optimizing the network’s scene-comprehension capability. (3) An ensemble of multi-scale models (EMSM) pseudo-label construction method is proposed to improve pseudo-label reliability. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is effective in improving the performance of Mars terrain segmentation."

Revisiting the utility of identifying nuclear grooves as unique nuclear changes by an object detector model,2024,"['Thyroid gland', 'Cytology', 'Fine-needle aspiration', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Machine learning']",,"Background: Among other structures, nuclear grooves are vastly found in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Considering that the application of artificial intelligence in thyroid cytology has potential for diagnostic routine, our goal was to develop a new supervised convolutional neural network capable of identifying nuclear grooves in Diff-Quik stained whole-slide images (WSI) obtained from thyroid fineneedle aspiration. Methods: We selected 22 Diff-Quik stained cytological slides with cytological diagnosis of PTC and concordant histological diagnosis. Each of the slides was scanned, forming a WSI. Images that contained the region of interest were obtained, followed by pre-formatting, annotation of the nuclear grooves and data augmentation techniques. The final dataset was divided into training and validation groups in a 7:3 ratio. Results: This is the first artificial intelligence model based on object detection applied to nuclear structures in thyroid cytopathology. A total of 7,255 images were obtained from 22 WSI, totaling 7,242 annotated nuclear grooves. The best model was obtained after it was submitted 15 times with the train dataset (14th epoch), with 67% true positives, 49.8% for sensitivity and 43.1% for predictive positive value. Conclusions: The model was able to develop a structure predictor rule, indicating that the application of an artificial intelligence model based on object detection in the identification of nuclear grooves is feasible. Associated with a reduction in interobserver variability and in time per slide, this demonstrates that nuclear evaluation constitutes one of the possibilities for refining the diagnosis through computational models."

GBGNN: Gradient Boosted Graph Neural Networks,2024,"['Ensemble Method', 'Gradient Boosting', 'Graph Neural Network']",,"In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively used to analyze graph data across variousdomains because of their powerful capabilities in learning complex graph-structured data. However, recentresearch has focused on improving the performance of a single GNN with only two or three layers. This isbecause stacking layers deeply causes the over-smoothing problem of GNNs, which degrades the performanceof GNNs significantly. On the other hand, ensemble methods combine individual weak models to obtain bettergeneralization performance. Among them, gradient boosting is a powerful supervised learning algorithm thatadds new weak models in the direction of reducing the errors of the previously created weak models. Afterrepeating this process, gradient boosting combines the weak models to produce a strong model with betterperformance. Until now, most studies on GNNs have focused on improving the performance of a single GNN.In contrast, improving the performance of GNNs using multiple GNNs has not been studied much yet. In thispaper, we propose gradient boosted graph neural networks (GBGNN) that combine multiple shallow GNNswith gradient boosting. We use shallow GNNs as weak models and create new weak models using the proposedgradient boosting-based loss function. Our empirical evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate thatGBGNN performs much better than a single GNN. Specifically, in our experiments using graph convolutionalnetwork (GCN) and graph attention network (GAT) as weak models on the Cora dataset, GBGNN achievesperformance improvements of 12.3%p and 6.1%p in node classification accuracy compared to a single GCNand a single GAT, respectively."

These methods quantitatively assess the stylistic proximities and divergences among Milton, Wordsworth, Keats, and other poets of the 19th century. Although Keats was profoundly inspired by Milton’s Paradise Lost, he was critical of Milton’s linguistic style, aspiring to erase the precursor’s influence from his own poetic language. This task he eventually deemed impossible, thereby abandoning his epic project. This research begins with the question of whether it will be possible to quantitatively confirm stylistic similarities between Paradise Lost and the Hyperion poems. Interestingly, the analysis reveals that Wordsworth, not Keats, shares the most stylistic similarities with Milton. Various stylometric analysis methods consistently support the stylistic similarity between Milton and Wordsworth. The fact that Wordsworth is identified as the poet whose style most closely aligns with Milton’s highlights the complex ways in which his literary legacy was reinterpreted and woven into the fabric of Romantic poetic expression. Stylometry provides a unique methodological lens, uncovering the distinct stylistic fingerprints of each poet and contextualizing these insights within the larger narrative of literary evolution from Milton’s magnum opus, Paradise Lost, through to the Romantic poets’ pursuit of epic poetry. Not only does this analytical approach enrich our understanding of the enduring influence of literary tradition and the creative processes of individual authors. But it also underscores the pivotal role of digital humanities in unlocking new dimensions of literary analysis—in other words, in offering fresh perspectives on the dialogues between past literary greatness and subsequent poetic endeavors."

비정렬 열화상 이미지와 RGB 이미지에 대한 상호 참조 및 융합을 통한 듀얼 모달 깊이 추정,2024,"['Depth Estimation', 'Dual-modal', 'Misalignment', 'Robustness']",,"Research on depth estimation is highly applicable in various fields, such as autonomous driving and virtual reality. Depth estimation aims to predict the distance from the camera to the position in 3D space corresponding to each pixel when it is mapped from a 2D image. Thermal images provide reliable visual information in low-light conditions, such as at night, while RGB images offer consistent high-quality data during the day. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective deep learning method that utilizes both thermal and RGB images to estimate depth information from each image. Additionally, because thermal and RGB images are generally captured in an misaligned state, this paper introduces (i) feature extraction from misaligned thermal and RGB images and their Cross-fusion module and their dual-modality cross-fusion module, (ii) a shared encoder-decoder structure for processing dual-modality inputs, and (iii) a multi-objective training strategy for simultaneous supervised learning from both modalities. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method through various experiments, achieving performance improvements of 7% and 4% compared to using single-modal inputs (thermal images or RGB images)."
A customized template matching classification system,2024,['MDC · United criterion · Template matching'],,"This paper presents two novel classification techniques, the customized template matching classifier (CTMC) and the dynamic template matching classifier (DTMC), which aim to significantly enhance the performance of the minimum distance classi f ier (MDC). CTMC tailors a feature subspace specifically for MDC, leveraging a set of effective templates that capture the distinguishing characteristics of each class. This customized feature space ensures accurate representation and enhanced distinguishability between classes, thereby improving MDC’s classification accuracy. DTMC, on the other hand, builds upon the CTMC approach by introducing a dynamic template optimization process. Inspired by semi-supervised learning tech niques, DTMC utilizes unlabeled data to enrich class information and iteratively update the templates in the feature space.This dynamic optimization process allows DTMC to adapt to variations in the data, further enhancing the classification performance of MDC. Our key contributions include: (1) introducing the concept of a customized feature space tailored for MDC, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving classifier performance; (2) presenting CTMC and DTMC as comprehen sive classification systems that seamlessly integrate feature extraction and classification, outperforming traditional loosely coupled approaches; and (3) incorporating a reliability mechanism to assess the classification of test samples, enabling the selection of high-reliability samples to update class templates, effectively addressing the issue of limited labeled data and further boosting the overall performance of the classification system."

A concise overview of principal support vector machines and its generalization,2024,"['sufficient dimension reduction', 'principal support vector machine', 'principal machine', 'M-estimation', 'convex optimization']",,"In high-dimensional data analysis, sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) has been considered as an attractive tool for reducing the dimensionality of predictors while preserving regression information.The principal support vector machine (PSVM) (Li et al., 2011) offers a unified approach for both linear and nonlinear SDR. This article comprehensively explores a variety of SDR methods based on the PSVM, which we call principal machines (PM) for SDR. The PM achieves SDR by solving a sequence of convex optimizations akin to popular supervised learning methods, such as the support vector machine, logistic regression, and quantile regression, to name a few. This makes the PM straightforward to handle and extend in both theoretical and computational aspects, as we will see throughout this article."

Existing NR-IQA techniques have high sensitivity to specific distortion types, but have limitations in determining semantic quality information or global image quality degradation. In this paper, to resolve the limitations of existing NR-IQA approaches and improve predictive power, we propose a multi-scale pseudo image quality assessor (MPIQ). MPIQ is an NR-IQA model that follows the framework of full-reference IQA (FR-IQA), which is more proficient in extracting local distortion patterns and aggregating higher-level perceptual quality information. The proposed MPIQ employs a hybrid scheme that seeks to understand local distortion patterns through the convolutional neural networks and global level of image quality based on transformers, and consists of two modules: a pseudo-reference image reconstructor and a quasi FR-IQA regressor. Similar to the FR-IQA approach, the pseudo-reference image reconstructor utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to reconstruct the pseudo-reference image and learn image degradation information compared to a distorted one. Here, a multi-scale structure is reflected to extract scale-invariant distortion patterns. Quasi FR-IQA regressor predicts the image quality score by deriving the global distortion level through the difference between the features extracted from the distorted and the pseudo-reference images. MPIQ was supervised onto the mean opinion score obtained through subjective evaluation in an end-to-end manner, and experimental results showed a 20% performance improvement compared to the existing NR-IQA."
Institutional Proposals for Enhancing Board Diversity in Chinese Companies,2024,"['Board diversity', 'Corporate governance', 'Environmental', 'Social and governance', 'Female directors', 'Board of directors', 'Gender diversity', '이사회 구성의 다양성', '기업지배구조', '환경·사회·지배구조', '여성이사', '이사회', '성별다양성']",,"Recently,  environmental, social, and governance (ESG) has become a new paradigm for corporate management and investment as a global trend. In particular, the board diversity is being emphasized as a standard related to the corporate governance of ESG. In a broader sense, the board diversity includes race, gender, nationality, and sexual orientation, and in a narrow sense, the board diversity focuses on gender diversity, among which female directors are a key issue. In this regard, while some countries implement a female director quota system that forces the appointment of female directors, others implement a system that entrusts the appointment of female directors to the autonomy of companies.In general, the board of directors is a main body in a company's business decision-making, and the responsibilities of directors who are members of the board of directors are gradually expanding. Since there is an important relationship between corporate governance and sustainable growth, the issue of the board diversity has become an important concern for long-term investors.There are a number of empirical studies that say that expanding the number of female directors can improve the monitoring and supervision functions and decision-making functions of the board of directors and can improve corporate management performance through changes in corporate culture. In other words, it can be evaluated that there is a correlation between securing gender diversity and improving corporate management performance or corporate governance in the board diversity.From this point of view, in order for listed companies in China to further grow into a global company, it is necessary to pay more attention to securing the board diversity, such as expanding the number of female directors, and the Chinese government needs to strengthen policy support on the board diversity.In conclusion, the following institutional improvement measures should be taken to improve the board diversity  of Chinese companies. First, it is necessary to promote policies that provide internal motivation for the board diversity  for Chinese companies. For example, in most companies, it is necessary to implement policies to promote the appointment of female directors because the board diversity is insufficient.Second, it is necessary to promote policies to improve the quality of information disclosure by Chinese companies regarding the diversity of the board of directors. In addition to promoting the introduction of a mandatory disclosure system, it is necessary to develop qualitative and quantitative disclosure indicators.Third, there is a need to improve the evaluation model for the diversity of the board of directors and ESG of Chinese companies. The ESG evaluation model needs to be improved by incorporating long-term practical experience. In order not to neglect the diversity of the board of directors, it is necessary to delegate the evaluation to a more specialized institution such as the Women's Federation to summarize the experience and use it to improve the overall evaluation model.Fourth, it is necessary to establish a regular exchange platform between mainland China and Hong Kong so that companies can share and learn experiences and examples of ESG practice between companies in various aspects"
Fall Detection Using FMCW Radar to Reduce Detection Errors for the Elderly,2024,"['Contactless Detection', 'Detection Error Reduction', 'Fall Detection', 'FMCW Radar', 'Fused Feature.']",,"Fall accidents pose a significant threat of severe injuries for the elderly, who often need immediate assistance when they fall. Since the use of conventional contact sensors or cameras might be uncomfortable for the user, research on fall detection using non-contact sensors has received considerable attention. While most prior studies have relied heavily on Doppler-based velocity parameters to detect falls, using only Doppler information may lead to erroneous detection of fall-like behavior. As a result, a feature that accounts for additional information is necessary. Addressing this need, this study developed an algorithm for classifying falls by detecting human motions using frequency modulation continuous wave radar, proposing a novel feature to reduce detection errors. The suggested feature was computed using the rangevelocity map of the 2D Fourier transform and evaluated using supervised machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis, attaining an accuracy higher than 91%."

Recently, visualization and computation in 3D space are accelerating due to improvements in the performance of computer hardware, and methods for generating 3D objects are being researched due to advances in GAN technology. The GAN-based network proposed a 3D-VAE-IWGAN method that receives images as input, generates voxels, and learns by introducing a Wasserstein loss function and applying a gradient penalty.

The improved gaze accuracy of the gaze estimation network in the semi-supervised learning validates the effectiveness of our data augmentation, especially when the number of gaze labels is 50k or less."

A three-dimensional light detectionand ranging (3D LiDAR) sensor was used to scan the greenhouse to extract point cloud data (PCD). Differential thresholds of the color index wereapplied to the partitions of raw PCD to separate steel frames from plastic films. Additionally, the K-means algorithm was used to convert the steelframe PCD into the nodes of unit members. These nodes were subsequently transformed into structural shape data. To verify greenhouse shapereproducibility, the member lengths of the scan and blueprint models were compared with the measurements along the X-, Y-, and Z-axes. The errorof the scan model was accurate at 2%-3%, whereas the error of the blueprint model was 5.4%. At a maximum snow depth of 0.5 m, the scan modelrevealed asymmetric horizontal deflection and extreme bending stress, which indicated that even minor shape irregularities could result in critical failuresin extreme weather. The safety factor for bending stress in the scan model was 18.7% lower than that in the blueprint model. This phenomenonindicated that precise shape estimation is crucial for safety diagnostic. Future studies should focus on the development of an automated process basedon supervised learning to ensure the widespread adoption of greenhouse safety diagnostics."

Universities are expanding competency-based education into human and social fields by reconsidering new talent awards and the direction of education. In this way, each university selects and organizes core competencies and incorporates the core competencies that the university pursues into educational goals. Under the supervision of the Ministry of Education, education centered on core competencies is exploring its potential in liberal arts courses at universities above all else. We want to explore a methodology that can achieve learner-centered teaching and learning effects in the process of incorporating and accepting this. Language acquisition along with cross-cultural understanding is above all else a part that can promote learners' competencies in terms of diversity and mutual understanding. Therefore, we reflect this in French liberal arts education and explore teaching and learning processes by incorporating respect for diversity and mutual cultural understanding competency education related to learners' motivation into lectures. We aim to supplement this through collaboration and mutual cultural understanding processes as presentation tasks in order to overcome the existing competency-based evaluation while deriving acceptance results from learners. Therefore, they recognize that the direction of core competency education naturally shifts to value-centered education."

The ‘regulatory sandbox’ is a system that is managed through controlled screening of new products or services in cooperation with regulatory agencies under the supervision of regulatory agencies.The U.S. regulatory sandbox has three important goals. First, it promotes innovation or competition. Second, it addresses regulatory barriers that hinder innovation. Third, learn about the development of the market. By considering each goal individually, regulators can determine whether the sandbox is the best strategy to achieve policy goals. The design of the U.S. regulatory sandbox must first consider actual conditions such as applied legal frameworks, second qualifications, third, screening restrictions, fourth, market conditions, and fifth, capacity.The main steps for the successful operation of the U.S. sandbox are as follows. First, organize a sandbox team. Second, establish internal support. Third, allocate sufficient resources. Fourth, outline internal procedures. Fifth, coordinate with external stakeholders. Sixth, establish formal and informal support channels. Stakeholder participation is also an important part of the sandbox design and operation. When formulating a stakeholder participation plan, regulators must consider the opinions of market participants, internal stakeholders, and other regulators.Legal Technology refers to “an innovative technology that enables efficient and easy use of legal services.” The development of Legal Tech helps to increase the efficiency of legal services, improve access to justice, and provide equitable access to justice by helping users solve their legal problems or connecting them with lawyers to do so.There are four main procedures regarding the application of regulatory sandboxes in U.S. legal services. ① Participants are recruited, evaluated, and approved to participate in the sandbox. ② A temporary safety haven will be established for the approved participants accordingly. ③ Related information is collected, and the competent authorities of cooperation monitor the performance of participants in the sandbox, such as issuing updated reports. ④ A long-term license or reform is recommended after the participant's period in the sandbox ends."

This study mapping the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) of Changwon City, where active climate and environmental research is being conducted, using the protocol suggested by the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT). Additionally, to address the fragmentation issue where some grids are classified with different climate characteristics despite being in regions with homogeneous climate traits, a filtering technique was applied, and the LCZ classification characteristics were compared according to the filtering radius. Using satellite images, ground reference data, and the supervised classification machine learning technique Random Forest, classification maps without filtering and with filtering radii of 1, 2, and 3 were produced, and their accuracies were compared. Furthermore, to compare the LCZ classification characteristics according to building types in urban areas, an urban form index used in GIS-based classification methodology was created and compared with the ranges suggested in previous studies. As a result, the overall accuracy was highest when the filtering radius was 1. When comparing the urban form index, the differences between LCZ types were minimal, and most satisfied the ranges of previous studies. However, the study identified a limitation in reflecting the height information of buildings, and it is believed that adding data to complement this would yield results with higher accuracy. The findings of this study can be used as reference material for creating fundamental spatial data for environmental research related to urban climates in South Korea."

He was a descendant of the Andong Kwon clan, one of the most prominent families of the late Goryeo Dynasty, and the great-grandson of Kwon Bo(權溥). Kwon Bo was the brother of Kwon Geun(權近), a scholar who was instrumental in the introduction of Neo-Confucianism to Goryeo.Kwon Woo's great strength was in literature, especially poetry. He was taught academically at an early age by his older brother Kwon Geun, who was 11 years older than him. It's likely that he also learned the basics of what a writer should know and how to write a poem from him. However, Kwon Woo’s poetry and artistic style show a world of his own, different from that of Kwon Geun. This is due to Kwon Woo’s political stance, ideological orientation, and rise as an official, which were different from Kwon Geun’s. He was also influenced by the people he interacted with, such as Byeon Gyeryang, Lee Won, and Lee Jik.Kwon Woo entered the government service in 1385(King Woo 11) after passing the civil service exams with second place. He was a representative bureaucrat of the late Goryeo and early Joseon Dynasties who served the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasties as an official for over 30 years. He mainly worked in academic, educational, and research institutions such as Seongkyunkwan, Ziphyeonjeon, and Yeomungwan, and he supervised the civil service exams on three occasions and served as a mentor to the crown prince.Kwon Woo’s great strengths lie in his scholarly side rather than his bureaucratic side. His collection <Maeheonjib(梅軒集)> contains a total of 384 poems, many of which are outstanding, demonstrating his quality as a poet.His 384 poems cover all areas of Chinese poetry: Oeongosi, Chileongosi, Oeonyulsi, Chieonyulsi, Oeonbaeyul, Oeonjeolgu, Chileonjeolgu, Jobchesi, Sa(詞)... This shows not only that he was quite skilled in the art of writing  Sino-Korean poetry, but also that he tried to write poetry in a variety of forms.In terms of artistic style, he combines both Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty styles. However, his strong points, such as his excellent diction and sensuous word choice, reflect the Tang Dynasty style. In terms of the aesthetic characteristics of Sino-Korean poetry, Maeheon’s poetry is characterized by a strong sense of melancholy thoughts and memories. This is very different from the 16th-century Neo-Confucianist’s notions of Pyongdam(平淡)·Chungdam(沖淡) or of Hanjeok(閑適)·Jeona(典雅). He is also far from the Pyoil(飄逸)·Gogo(高古) who pursued freedom from worldly desires. His poetry is also different from the extreme tragedy and worldly satire of Lim Chun and others in the middle of the Goryeo dynasty.Ancient critics characterized Maeheon’s poetry as ‘Cheongryo(淸麗)’ and ‘Jinmil(縝密)’. The former relates to the use of words and the subject matter, while the latter relates to the aesthetic characteristic and organization of the poem. In particular, ‘Cheongryo’ is closely related to the Tang Dynasty style of poetry, which is why Maeheon’s poetry is strongly influenced by the Tang Dynasty style.In terms of content, the themes of Maeheon’s poetry can be summarized into three broad categories: the perception of misfortune, the lamentation of poverty and illness, and the longing for public office. And it can be said that this is fundamentally rooted in Maeheon’s ideological orientation, which pursued the value of ‘Gyeongukjemin(經國濟民)’."
