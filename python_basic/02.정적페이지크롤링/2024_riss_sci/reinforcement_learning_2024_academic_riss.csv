Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) add uncertainty to energy demand that can be dealt with flexible operation (e.g., load-following) of CPES; at the same time, scenarios that could result in severe consequences due to both component stochastic failures and aging of the cyber system of CPES (commonly overlooked) must be accounted for Operation & Maintenance (O&M) planning. In this paper, we make use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to search for the optimal O&M strategy that, not only considers the actual system hardware components health conditions and their Remaining Useful Life (RUL), but also the possible accident scenarios caused by the failures and the aging of the hardware and the cyber components, respectively. The novelty of the work lies in embedding the cyber aging model into the CPES model of production planning and failure process; this model is used to help the RL agent, trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Imitation Learning (IL), finding the proper rejuvenation timing for the cyber system accounting for the uncertainty of the cyber system aging process. An application is provided, with regards to the Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED)."

However, most existing research primarily concentrates on numerical simulations for learning algorithms, often neglecting the challenges encountered in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, this study introduces a semi-real environment that combines MuJoCo Gym simulation with a real camera sensor, aiming to create a more realistic augmented simulation for state-of-the-art visual RL algorithms. The usefulness of this semi-real environment was initially demonstrated through conventional camera-free learning, revealing that general RL experiences substantial performance degradation, especially with fast-moving objects, due to motion blur effects. Building on this semi-real environment, the study also presents the deceleration visual RL (DVRL) algorithm, which incorporates a novel deep learning-based image quality assessment to evaluate the suitability of the acquired data for learning policies. The DVRL algorithm performs real-time image quality assessment and manages fast-moving targets by adjusting their speed, thereby balancing speed and image quality to optimize policy learning and achieve superior performance compared to baseline models."
UAV Head-On Situation Maneuver Generation Using Transfer-Learning-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning,2024,['Air-to-air maneuver · Transfer  learning · Head-on · UAV'],,"Recently, the demand for unmanned aerial vehicle technology has increased. In particular, AI pilots through reinforcement learning (RL) are more flexible than those using rule-based methods. Further, AI pilots with RL are expected to replace human pilots in the future. In a recent study, rather than completely replacing humans, studies on AI pilots are conducted toward the collaboration between man and unmanned aircraft. AI pilots have several advantages over humans. For example, on the one hand, human pilots avoid head-on situations due to collision. On the other hand, AI pilots may prefer head-on situations to finish the episode quickly. This study proposes a two-circle-based transfer learning method to demonstrate excellent performance in head-on situations. Based on the experimental results, the proposed two-circle-based multi-task transfer learning model outperforms the model without transfer learning-based RL. A study on transfer-learning-based learning technique has been conducted. However, it had a one-circle-based learning technique was specialized only for tail-chasing, limiting its application (Bae et al. in IEEE Access 11:26427–26440, 2023). Practically, the proposed two-circle-based learning technique outperforms the one-circle-based transfer learning technique in head-on situations."
Exoatmospheric Evasion Guidance Law with Total Energy Limit via Constrained Reinforcement Learning,2024,"['Pursuit-evasion', 'Exoatmospheric vehicle', 'Guidance law', 'Reinforcement learning', 'Constraint', 'Energy consumption']",,"Due to the lack of aerodynamic forces, the available propulsion for exoatmospheric pursuit-evasion problem is strictly limited, which has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper focuses on the evasion guidance in an exoatmospheric environment with total energy limit. A Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) method is proposed to solve the problem. Firstly, the acceleration commands of the evader are defined as cost and an Actor-Critic-Cost (AC2) network structure is established to predict the accumulated cost of a trajectory. The learning objective of the agent becomes to maximize cumulative rewards while satisfying the cost constraint. Secondly, a Maximum-Minimum Entropy Learning (M2EL) method is proposed to minimize the randomness of acceleration commands while preserving the agent’s exploration capability. Our approaches address two challenges in the application of reinforcement learning: constraint specification and precise control. The well-trained agent is capable of generating accurate commands while satisfying the specified constraints. The simulation results indicate that the CRL and M2EL methods can effectively control the agent’s energy consumption within the specified constraints. The robustness of the agent under information error is also validated."

In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing advanced methods to predict crop yield based on the demand for a crop. The goal is not only to maximize yields but also to ensure that the crop is in demand and farmers can earn profits. In keeping with the 2030 United Nations targets for food security and farmer decision-making support, the significance of precise crop output prediction is discussed here. One of the most promising methods for predicting crop yields is using the double deep recurrent reinforcement learning method and cybertwin. This approach involves predicting crop yields based on crop demand during cultivation, with reinforcement learning being applied to make better choices in crop selection. The proposed system model utilizes LSTM and Q-network to fine-tune the prediction. The algorithm's simulation and evaluation show that it outperforms the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method in terms of recall, F-measure, precision, and accuracy, which are parameters based on the confusion matrix. The method's recurrent nature helps refine the prediction, and the use of cybertwin ensures that the model's predictions align with real-world conditions. The proposed double deep recurrent reinforcement learning method and cybertwin are promising approaches that can aid farmers in making informed decisions and maximizing their profits.

Selective imitation for efficient online reinforcement learning with pre-collected data,2024,['Deep reinforcement learningOff-policy reinforcement learningPre-collected dataBehavioral cloningImitation learning'],,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution for autonomous devices requiring sequential decision-making. In the online RL framework, the agent must interact with the environment to collect data, making sample efficiency the most challenging aspect. While the off-policy method in online RL partially addresses this issue by employing a replay buffer, learning speed remains slow, particularly at the beginning of training, due to the low quality of data collected with the initial policy. To overcome this challenge, we propose Reward-Adaptive Pre-collected Data RL (RAPD-RL), which leverages pre-collected data in addition to online RL. We employ two buffers: one for pre-collected data and another for online collected data. The policy is trained using both buffers to increase the objective and imitate the actions in the dataset. To maintain resistance to poor-quality (i.e., low-reward) data, our method selectively imitates data based on reward information, thereby enhancing sample efficiency and learning speed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution converges rapidly and achieves high performance across various dataset qualities."

The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach is utilized to identify the most influential input features affecting the predicted shear capacity of RCTBs. The SHAP results indicate that the shear span-to-depth ratio (a/d) has the most significant effect on the shear capacity of RCTBs, followed by the ratio of shear reinforcement multiplied by the yield strength of shear reinforcement (), flange thickness (), and flange width (). The accuracy of the XGBoost model in predicting the shear capacity of RCTBs is compared with established codes of practice (ACI 318-19, BS 8110-1:1997, EN 1992-1-2, CSA23.3-04) and existing formulas from researchers.

On the other hand, the CFRP thickness and concrete strength exhibited a positive relationship with the compressive strength. The study also determined that the influence of column diameter and CFRP thickness was greater compared to the influence of CFRP fracture strain and elastic modulus on the compressive strength. To predict the compressive strength, the researchers developed a machine learning algorithm-based compressive strength prediction model. They found that a backpropagation (BP) neural network model showed high prediction accuracy and robustness in predicting the strength.

To investigate this, a novel trust behavior task was developed to observe trust, and a reinforcement learning model was utilized to assess behavioral indicators. Initially, to observe trust behavior in a context beyond strategic economic actions and within everyday settings, a task focused on honesty verification through trust-related information gathering was designed. Data obtained from this task were analyzed using a Hybrid Reinforcement Learning (HRL) model, which integrates habitual and goal-oriented behavioral values in decision-making. This analysis explored how variations in the counterpart's honesty, consistency, and reward conditions affected behavioral values and learning characteristics in different trust scenarios. A preliminary experiment was conducted to identify differences in trust and distrust formation and their impact on trust learning. The results indicated that when trust in the counterpart was present, the learning rate was higher, and decision-making was less exploratory. In contrast, when trust was absent, individuals engaged in goal-oriented decision-making by placing more emphasis on assessing the counterpart’s reliability when calculating behavioral values. The main experiment compared trust formation under monetary and non-monetary reward conditions to determine if the type of reward influenced trust learning or behavioral patterns. While no significant differences were found in reinforcement learning parameters based on reward type, differences in cognitive processes during decision-making were observed based on response speed. This study is significant as it expands the scope of trust research by devising a trust task based on readily observable behaviors and analyzing it using a Hybrid Reinforcement Learning model."

Since it is difficult to know the click probability of each banner alternative in advance, managers must experiment with multiple alternatives, estimate the click probability of each alternative based on customer clicks, and find the optimal alternative. In this reinforcement learning process, the main decision problem is to find the optimal balance between the level of exploitation strategy that utilizes the accumulated estimated click probability information and exploration strategy that tries new alternatives to find potentially better options. In this study we analyze the impact of word-of-mouth effects and the number of alternatives on the optimal exploration-exploitation strategies. More specifically, we focus on the word-of-mouth effect, where the click-through rate of the banner increases as customers promote the related product to those around them after clicking the exposed banner, and add it to the overall reinforcement learning process. We analyze our problem by employing the Multi-Armed Bandit model, and the analysis results show that the larger the word-of-mouth effect and the fewer the number of banner alternatives, the higher the optimal exploration level of advertising reinforcement learning. We find that as the probability of customers clicking on the banner increases due to the word-of-mouth effect, the value of the previously accumulated estimated click-through rate knowledge decreases, and therefore the value of exploring new alternatives increases.

Collective navigation in complex environments is essential for various applications such as search and rescue, environment monitoring and military tasks operations. Conventional methods, which are easily interpretable from an engineering perspective, divide the navigation tasks into mapping, planning, and control; however, they struggle with increased latency and unmodeled environmental factors. Recently, learning-based methods have addressed these problems by employing the end-to-end framework with neural networks. Nonetheless, most existing learning-based approaches face challenges in complex scenarios particularly for navigating through a narrow gap or when a leader or informed UAV is unavailable. Our approach uses the information of a certain number of nearest neighboring UAVs and incorporates a task-specific curriculum to reduce learning time and train a robust model. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through an ablation study and quantitative metrics. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods."

They play a crucial role in accurately detecting underwater targets, making them effective detection systems in anti-submarine warfare. Existing sonobuoy deployment methods in multistatic systems often rely on fixed patterns or heuristic-based rules, lacking efficiency in terms of the number of sonobuoys deployed and operational time due to the unpredictable mobility of the underwater targets. Thus, this paper proposes an optimal sonobuoy placement strategy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to overcome the limitations of conventional sonobuoy deployment methods. The proposed approach utilizes reinforcement learning in a simulation-based experimental environment that considers the movements of the underwater targets. The Unity ML-Agents framework is employed, and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is utilized for UAV learning in a virtual operational environment with real-time interactions. The reward function is designed to consider the number of sonobuoys deployed and the cost associated with sound sources and receivers, enabling effective learning. The proposed reinforcement learning-based deployment strategy compared to the conventional sonobuoy deployment methods in the same experimental environment demonstrates superior performance in terms of detection success rate, deployed sonobuoy count, and operational time."

However, due to the limitations of vehicle-centric autonomy, AVs still fail to appropriately handle various unexpected situations, adversely affecting traffic flow and causing crashes. Therefore, for AVs to achieve their anticipated positive impact on traffic flow, it is necessary to evolve into Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), including the cooperation of infrastructure based on Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communication. The cooperative driving effect of CAVs will be evident in the case of lane closed situations caused by unexpected events such as traffic accidents or construction. If CAVs can acquire information about the lane closed situation through infrastructure communication in advance and control their maneuvers of CAVs appropriately, it is expected that the systematic movement of CAVs will alleviate issues such as bottlenecks caused by closed lanes and ensure a smoother traffic flow. This indicates the necessity for research on strategies to smoothly avoid and pass through closed lane situations in future LV4 autonomous driving situation where CAV maneuver control is possible. Reinforcement learning, which can accommodate large state spaces like traffic situations, has recently emerged as a promising framework for addressing the control challenges of CAVs, which must flexibly respond to real-time dynamic traffic conditions. Therefore, this study developed a reinforcement learning-based strategy for avoiding closed lanes and evaluated its impact on traffic flow, thereby demonstrating the utility of reinforcement learning as a methodology for developing closed lane avoidance strategies for CAVs in future connected environments."

Maximized-Actor-Critic(MAC)을 이용한  정책 경사 강화학습 방법,2024,"['Actor-Critic', 'Value-Based', 'Policy-Based', 'Maximized Actor-Critic', 'Reinforcement Learning']",,"Reinforcement learning has garnered significant attention in contemporary times due to its applicability across various fields. It is being applied experimentally and commercially in diverse fields, including games, robotics, and autonomous systems. These forms of reinforcement learning are broadly categorized as Value-Based, Policy-Based, and Actor-Critic methods. Value-Based assigns a value to every action to select the most valuable action in a given state, while Policy-Based assigns a probability to every action to select an action in a given state. In the case of Value-Based, the computation increases as the learning environment grows larger, making it impossible to run environments that require continuous behavior, and performance degrades with larger environments. On the other hand, in the case of Policy-Based methods, the model can be unstable since it is trained with a policy that probabilistically selects actions. The Actor-Critic method, designed to tackle these issues, still faces learning instability due to its shared behavioral selection approach with Policy-Based methods. In this paper, we propose the Maximized Actor-Critic method, which maximizes the action choices of actors based on the Actor-Critic approach. Since the existing Actor-Critic method generates behaviors from a single actor, its goal is to converge on high expectation values and stable reward values based on the actor with the maximum score. To evaluate the performance improvement of this algorithm, we added it to the existing Actor-Critic algorithm and performed a performance comparison analysis. We verified that the proposed algorithm achieves the stability and high expectation values observed in previous Actor- Critic-based algorithms."

Using these signal data, a deep reinforcement learning network continuously predicts the location of the illegal drones and controls the positions and movements of the tracking drones to facilitate close approach. The proposed deep reinforcement learning model was trained considering various channel conditions, and performance evaluations show that our method reduces the number of movements by 5.41% to 6.92% and the travel distance by 11.5% to 15.8%, compared to existing methods."

However, it is difficult to operate chillers to meet the cooling demand of the building as the demand fluctuates with various factors like the internal, external environment and behavior of the occupants and as chiller’s constraint cause the current operation constrains operation in future. To address these problems, this study proposes a multi-chiller operation model based on deep reinforcement learning considering the minimum up-time of the chiller. The proposed model learns the value of the chiller operations according to the state composed of metrological and cooling system information and determines operation that minimizes the difference between the supply load and the cooling demand among feasible operations. The practical applicability was improved by applying the training algorithm considering the minimum up-time constraint and Experiments results using the actual data from a Korean university confirmed that the proposed model complies with the chiller constraints and outperforms the existing chiller operation logic of the university in terms of differences from the building cooling demand."

We trained the DQN model with an environment that simulates demands, incoming and outgoing vehicles, parking duration and lead time. Numerical analysis compares the proposed dynamic pricing model with the current static pricing policy.

MQTT 기반 IoT 네트워크에서 강화학습을 활용한 Retained 메시지 전송 방법,2024,['Retained'],,"In the MQTT protocol, if the retained flag of a message published by a publisher is set, the message is stored in the broker as a retained message. When a new subscriber performs a subscribe, the broker immediately sends the retained message. This allows the new subscriber to perform updates on the current state via the retained message without waiting for new messages from the publisher. However, sending retained messages can become a traffic overhead if new messages are frequently published by the publisher. This situation could be considered an overhead when new subscribers frequently subscribe. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a retained message delivery scheme by considering the characteristics of the published messages. We model the delivery and waiting actions to new subscribers from the perspective of the broker using reinforcement learning, and determine the optimal policy through Q learning algorithm.

(연구방법) 본 연구는 플립러닝에 대한 개념과 그 특징에 대해 알아보고, 플립러닝 방식의 교육적 장점에 대해 고찰한다. 다음으로 국내외 수학교육의 동향을 분석하고, 선진적인 해외 수학체험센터의 사례조사를 통해 어린이 수학체험전시의 역할과 중요성에 대해 알아본다. 다음으로 플립러닝 방식의 프로세스를 적용한 어린이 수학체험전시공간 기획 디자인을 비교분석 해본다. 이미 준공된 A수학체험센터와 B수학체험센터의 디자인 사례를 통해 플립러닝 모듈을 적용한 전시 프로그램을 분석해본다. (결과) 기하를 중심 테마로 메이커교육을 특화시킨 A수학체험센터와 융합적 사고로 생활 속 다양한 스토리를 수학과 결합한 B수학체험센터의 디자인을 통해 플립러닝 프로세스를 적용한 디자인을 보면 다음과 같다. 사전학습의 부족한 부분을 채워주는 미디어 중심의 오리엔테이션과 퀴즈형 미션 프로그램 등이 플립러닝 프로세스를 강화시켜준다. 본격적인 수학체험공간에서는 스토리텔링 공간에서 수학적 원리를 직접 조작하고 상호반응하는 놀이를 통해 수학적 사고를 경험하고, 마지막으로 참여 토론 공간을 통해 수학의 심층적인 이해를 도왔다.

Mathematical understanding plays a pivotal role in navigating the daily life. In nurturing future talent, it is especially crucial to cultivate creativity and problem-solving skills, along with mathematical thinking. One educational method that addresses this issue is flipped learning, which overturns the traditional teaching methods. Despite its unique advantages, flipped learning poses challenges in classroom education due to environmental limitations. As an alternative to overcoming these challenges and fostering mathematical thinking, math experience centers have emerged. This study aimed to understand the concept of flipped learning and analyze the planning of children’s math experience exhibition spaces based on flipped learning, thereby contributing to the creation of future educational environments that align with societal demands. (Method)This study examined the concept and characteristics of flipped learning, along with its educational benefits. Subsequently, it analyzes domestic and international trends in mathematics education, exploring the roles and significance of children’s math experience exhibitions through case studies of advanced overseas math experience centers. Furthermore, this study compared and analyzed the design planning of children’s math experience exhibition spaces that incorporate flipped learning processes. By examining the design cases of already-established Math Experience Centers A and B, this study analyzes exhibition programs that integrate flipped learning modules.(Results) Focusing on geometry as the central theme, Math Experience Center A specializes in maker education, whereas Math Experience Center B integrates diverse everyday stories with mathematics through convergent thinking. Designs that incorporate the flipped learning process include features such as media-based orientations and quiz-based mission programs to address gaps in prior learning and enhance the flipped learning process. In the main math experience spaces, storytelling allows participants to directly manipulate mathematical principles and engage in interactive play to experience mathematical thinking. Finally, discussion spaces enable deeper understanding of mathematics through participatory debates. (Conclusion)To effectively incorporate the flipped learning process into children’s math experience exhibitions that engage in math culture, a spatial process was applied that encompassed prior learning, orientation, guided exploration, math experience, and in-depth discussion modules. The programs and designs were developed by integrating region-specific themes with diverse everyday stories. Currently, Math Experience Centers A and B are actively operating, leveraging their respective regional themes. As the importance of mathematical thinking continues to grow, more in-depth research on math experience spaces is essential for the development of math culture among future talents. Beyond the spatial design, operational aspects and presentation methods should be enhanced by integrating advanced technologies to reinforce the flipped learning process."

Therefore, to improve prediction performance, we propose conditional probability applying the Markov Chain method. This method is used to improve the prediction performance of the classifier by allowing the learner to add learning history data to the classification prediction in addition to classification prediction by machine learning. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, a total of more than 30 experiments were conducted per algorithm and indicator using empirical data, ‘Teaching aid-based early childhood education learning performance data’. As a result of the experiment, higher performance indicators were confirmed in cases using the proposed method than in cases where only the classification algorithm was used in all cases."

The survey results showed that EC-SDLM received significantly higher evaluations in terms of virtual presence, learners’ engagement, interactivity, and satisfaction compared to IC-SDLM. EC-SDLM effectively reinforced learners' experiences through interactive exploration and self-directed learning activities, while IC-SDLM, which primarily relied on lecture-oriented content delivery, demonstrated limited effectiveness in fostering learner participation and autonomy. The interview analysis revealed that learners positively evaluated the design of the metaverse-based learning environment, particularly its ability to enhance presence, interactivity, and autonomy.

기계학습 기반 스케줄링 전략을 적용한 최신 퍼징 연구,2024,"['Fuzzing', 'Machine Learning', 'Scheduling']",,"Fuzzing is an automated testing technique that generates a lot of testcases and monitors for exceptions to test a program. Recently, fuzzing research using machine learning has been actively proposed to solve various problems in the fuzzing process, but a comprehensive evaluation of fuzzing research using machine learning is lacking. In this paper, we analyze recent research that applies machine learning to scheduling techniques for fuzzing, categorizing them into reinforcement learning-based and supervised learning-based fuzzers. We evaluated the coverage performance of the analyzed machine learning-based fuzzers against real-world programs with four different file formats and bug detection performance against the LAVA-M dataset. The results showed that AFL-HIER, which applied seed clustering and seed scheduling with reinforcement learning outperformed in coverage and bug detection. In the case of supervised learning, it showed high coverage on tcpdumps with high code complexity, and its superior bug detection performance when applied to hybrid fuzzing. This research shows that performance of machine learning-based fuzzer is better when both machine learning and additional fuzzing techniques are used to optimize the fuzzing process. Future research is needed on practical and robust machine learning-based fuzzing techniques that can be effectively applied to programs that handle various input formats."

This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning-based prediction model for the column failure modes (shear, flexure-shear, and flexure failure modes). For this purpose, artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) models were used, considering previously collected experimental data. Using four machine learning methodologies, we developed a classification learning model that can predict the column failure modes in terms of the input variables using concrete compressive strength, steel yield strength, axial load ratio, height-to-dept aspect ratio, longitudinal reinforcement ratio, and transverse reinforcement ratio. The performance of each machine learning model was compared and verified by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and ROC. Based on the performance measurements of the classification model, the RF model represents the highest average value of the classification model performance measurements among the considered learning methods, and it can conservatively predict the shear failure mode. Thus, the RF model can rapidly predict the column failure modes with simple column details."

Due to the step-by-step modeling and interpretation process, existing seismic performance assessment and reinforcement design of buildings consume an enormous amount of workforce and time. Various machine learning (ML) models were developed using input and output datasets for seismic loads and reinforcement details built through the finite element (FE) model developed in previous studies to overcome these shortcomings. To assess the performance of the seismic performance prediction models developed in this study, the mean squared error (MSE), R-square (R2), and residual of each model were compared. Overall, the applied ML was found to rapidly and effectively predict the seismic performance of buildings according to changes in load and reinforcement details without overfitting.

It systematically presents neo-Confucian principles meant to be followed by all individuals. After experiencing periods of both decline and resurgence in Korea, Little Learning gained prominence during the mid-Joseon period when rural literati of neo-Confucian scholar-officials rose to power, positioning the text as a key source for Confucian doctrine. The book was later translated into Korean script and widely disseminated, making it accessible not only to women from Confucian scholar-official families but also to the broader populace, including commoners. As societal changes unfolded in the late Joseon era, Little Learning became a tool for women to learn and apply neo-Confucian ideology within their households, reinforcing their roles in upholding Confucian values in everyday life.Examining the women’s short biographies (haengjang) and epitaphs in late Joseon literature, one can find the traces which suggest that women at the time read Little Learning and lived according to its teachings. However, since these texts were written by men, mostly with the purpose of praising the virtues of the deceased, there may be exaggerations, with neo-Confucian ritual propriety likely emphasized to protect family honor. As a result, it is uncertain whether women actually lived as described. Nevertheless, societal and class changes heightened the importance of nel-Confucian propriety, and women who followed the teachings of Little Learning—obeying their in-laws and husbands, and performing ancestral memorial rites—became perfect examples of formal propriety, suitable to be publicly showcased.Moreover, the short biographies and epitaphs were not only written to honor the deceased but also served as instructive texts, allowing the living to learn from the virtues of those who had passed. These writings often provided better role models than instructional books did, as the historical accounts in texts like Little Learning were not only outdated but also less relevant, being from outside Korea. In contrast, the women, who had actually lived these virtues and praised in these biographies and epitaphs, were their grandmothers and mothers, making them more relatable and credible examples. Thus, these writings in pre-modern Korean literature acted as supplementary precept books, shaping and guiding women's behavior and lifestyles."

Without appropriate maintenance, the performance of aging structures can deteriorate, diminishing their utility. Predicting the safety performance of these structures with time characteristics is an effective strategy for maintenance planning and can  appropriately pre-determine the duration and cost for their safety performance. This research predicts the safety grade of domestic road facilities including bridges, tunnels, and retaining walls. A database for each facility type was constructed to perform the safety performance evaluations, detailed safety inspections, and precision safety diagnostics. Ordinary bridges, NATM tunnels, and reinforced concrete retaining walls were selected since they are the most common structural types in the database. The safety grade prediction model was developed based on machine learning techniques considering the service life of the structures. Three regression-based machine learning algorithms were used to develop an optimal prediction model: decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The accuracy and confusion matrix for the three machine learning models were compared. In the comparative results, the XGBoost model resulted in the highest accuracy of 100 % for the road bridges, road tunnels, and retaining walls, effectively reflecting the time characteristics."

Structural equation modeling was employed to achieve this research goal. Specifically, the study investigated whether the perception of hate speech, social influences, and factors related to policy responses directly influence the emotions and behavioral patterns of victims, or whether they indirectly influence them by mediating the variables of differential associations, differential reinforcement, and imitation, which are derived from social learning theory. The analysis data for this study utilized secondary data from the Korea Youth Policy Institute's 2020 survey on the exposure to hate speech among adolescents. The results of structural equation analysis indicated that the three independent variables not only directly influenced the psychological emotions and behavioral patterns of hate speech victims but also indirectly influenced the dependent variables through mediating parameters extracted from social learning variables. Therefore, it was firmly believed that the reason hate speech victims suffer mental and emotional distress and experience deteriorated interpersonal relationships is because adolescents who engage in hate speech without hesitation have learned it through social learning. This study is deemed to have significant academic implications as it validates the variables of social learning theory that influence the psychological and emotional emotions of adolescents who have experienced hate speech and their resulting deteriorated behavioral patterns."

Specifically, it examines how the effect of private education on academic achievement is influenced by students' self-directed learning abilities. Using longitudinal data from the 3rd to 5th waves of KELS 2013, provided by the Korea Educational Development Institute, the study employs a two-way fixed effects model to control for both student- and year-level fixed effects. To explore the interaction between self-directed learning and private education, an interaction term combining these variables was included in the analysis. The findings indicate that self-directed learning has a significant positive effect on academic achievement in Korean, English, and mathematics among middle school students. Notably, the interaction between self-directed learning and private education positively influences English achievement, while the main effect of private education alone is not statistically significant. This finding implies that the effect of private education on English achievement is mediated through its interaction with self-directed learning, rather than being an independent factor. Based on these findings, the study underscores the need for policy efforts to strengthen students' self-directed learning skills. It recommends reinforcing student-centered classroom practices to enhance self-directed learning as part of broader strategies to reduce reliance on private education."

Because nuclear power plant structure are usually constructed by material of reinforced concrete, the aging deterioration of R.C. have no small effect on structural behavior of nuclear power plant structure. Therefore, aging deterioration of R.C. nuclear power plant structure should be considered for exact prediction of seismic responses of the structure. In this study, a machine learning model for seismic response prediction of nuclear power plant structure was developed by considering aging deterioration. The OPR-1000 was selected as an example structure for numerical simulation. The OPR-1000 was originally designated as the Korean Standard Nuclear Power Plant (KSNP), and was re-designated as the OPR-1000 in 2005 for foreign sales. 500 artificial ground motions were generated based on site characteristics of Korea. Elastic modulus, damping ratio, poisson’s ratio and density were selected to consider material property variation due to aging deterioration. Six machine learning algorithms such as, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were used t o construct seispic response prediction model. 13 intensity measures and 4 material properties were used input parameters of the training database. Performance evaluation was performed using metrics like root mean square error, mean square error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination. The optimization of hyperparameters was achieved through k-fold cross-validation and grid search techniques.

The participants of the study were 425 students (36 males and 389 females) enrolled in the dance departments of five universities in Seoul and Gangwon Province, and the data were processed through descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis, reliability analysis, correlation, and structural equation modeling. The results of the structural equation model analysis are as follows: First, the research model was evaluated as a valid model for predicting the creative dance performance of dance majors. Second, the perceived creativity-supportive teaching and learning environment in dance class contributes to students' ability to generate and perform dance-related creative ideas by reinforcing their belief that creativity can grow. Third, the fixed belief that creativity does not change easily does not mediate the relationship between creative teaching and learning environments and creative dance performance. Findings suggest that underutilizing creativity- supportive teaching and learning strategies and believing that dance-related creativity can grow with effort and persistence are important to promote creative achievement in dance majors."

Clustering is mainly used for such unsupervised learning. One of the representative methods of such clustering is K-means clustering. Since K-means clustering is a method of determining the number of clusters and continuing to find the central point of the data allocated to the cluster, there is a problem that the clustered group may not be the optimal cluster. In this study, particle swarm optimization algorithm, which determines the motion vector by adding various variables as well as the center point, is applied to K-means clustering. The improved K-means clustering makes it possible to move toward better outcome values even when the center of cluster no longer change. In the conventional clustering method, the center of the cluster moves to the center of the data belonging to the cluster, and clustering ends when the cluster does not change, so other characteristics other than the center value are excluded. Unlike the conventional clustering method, the improved clustering method uses a central value, an average value, and a random value as variables, and a particle swarm optimization algorithm that modifies the vector for each iteration is applied. As a result, improved clustering method derived a better result value than the existing clustering method in the group's fitness index, silhouette score."

Robotic Autonomous Grasping Strategy and System for Cluttered Multiclass Objects,2024,"['Autonomous grasping', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'robot', 'soft actor-critic.']",,"With the increasing complexity of the robot grasping environment, it puts forward higher requirements on the grasping strategy of manipulators. However, grasping cluttered multi-class objects is a challenging task because the objects are stacked and occluded from each other, and it is often difficult for robots to find a suitable grasping position. Deep reinforcement learning with DQN algorithm has been used to study the pushing and grasping strategy to manipulate cluttered multi-class objects. However, there exists long learning time and low success rate. To solve this problem, we adopt two fully convolutional networks (FCN) to map the color and depth maps to actions: pushing and grasping. These two networks are trained by an improved soft actor-critic algorithm that includes auto entropy regularization, regularized objective function and clipped double Q learning. Pushing and grasping synergies has been learned with the dense reward feedback. The simulation experiment demonstrate that the learning process converges quickly and stable with a grasp success rate up to 83.3%. We further demonstrate the generalization ability and well performance of our models when novel objects appear in the scenes that the robot has never grasped before. Finally, real-world experiments with trained models from simulations are conducted to test the grasping performance on manually arranged scenes."
이미지 분류 성능 향상을 위한 무작위성 적용 방법론,2024,"['Data Augmentation', 'Randomness', 'Image classification', 'Deep Learning']",,"Securing various types of training data in image Classification is important for improving performance. However, increasing the amount of original data is cost-limited, so data diversity can be secured by transforming images through data augmentation.Recently, a new deep learning approach using Generative AI models like GAN or Diffusion Based models has emerged in the Data Augmentation task, and reinforcement learning-based methods such as AutoAugment and Deep AutoAugment using existing basic Augmentation techniques are also showing good performance. However, this method has the disadvantage of having a complicated optimization procedure and high computational cost. This paper conducted various experiments with existing methods Cutmix, Mixup, RandAugment. By combining these techniques appropriately, we obtained higher performance than existing method without much effort. Additionally, our ablation experiment shows that additional hyper-parameter adjustments are needed for the basic augmentation types when we use RandAugment.

Horst Klaus Berg의 성서교수학에 나타난 해석 다양성에 관한 연구,2024,"['Bible didactic', 'interpretation', 'diversification', 'experience', 'free learning', '성서교수학', '해석', '다양화', '경험', '자유 학습']",,"This study seeks to shed light on the contributions of Horst Klaus Berg to German Bible didactics, underscoring the pivotal role of diverse interpretative approaches in the teaching and learning of the Bible. In an era where the complexities and intricacies of the Bible present significant challenges to contemporary readers, the prevalence of one-dimensional interpretations further obstructs the pathway to a profound comprehension of the spiritual depth embedded within its texts. By centering on Horst Klaus Berg’s influential theories in the field of German Bible didactics, this research delves into the impact of varied biblical interpretations on Christian education. Berg’s work is celebrated for its insightful strategies, notably his advocacy for comprehensive interpretative methods such as “Railway Tracks” and “Free-Learning.” These approaches seek to reconcile traditional biblical teachings with individual experiences, thereby facilitating a more expansive understanding of the Bible’s applicability to modern life. Through a detailed examination of Berg’s theory on biblical interpretation, this paper argues that Christian education must prioritize the cultivation of diverse interpretative skills and their practical integration into Bible study. This educational model encourages learners to become active interpreters, capable of discerning the text’s deep-seated meanings by relating it to their personal experiences. The study concludes by affirming Berg’s delineation of three critical tasks in biblical interpretation: “reciprocal interpretation,” “acknowledgment of the biblical texts’ diversity,” and “free learning.” These elements are portrayed as interrelated and essential, reinforcing Berg’s proposition that understanding the Bible’s complexity and diversity is crucial for advancing Christian education. This paper offers a novel perspective on the significance of embracing multifaceted interpretations within the domain of biblical studies."

The Study on Visualizing the Impact of Filter Bubbles on Social Media Networks,2024,"['Information Society', 'Personalization Algorithms', 'Filter Bubble', 'Liberal and Conservative Bias']",,"In this study, we delve into the effects of personalization algorithms on the creation of “filter bubbles,” which can isolate individuals intellectually by reinforcing their pre-existing biases, particularly through personalized Google searches. By setting up accounts with distinct ideological learnings—progressive and conservative—and employing deep neural networks to simulate user interactions, we quantitatively confirmed the existence of filter bubbles. Our investigation extends to the deployment of an LSTM model designed to assess political orientation in text, enabling us to bias accounts deliberately and monitor their increasing ideological inclinations. We observed politically biased search results appearing over time in searches through biased accounts. Additionally, the political bias of the accounts continued to increase. These results provide numerical evidence for the existence of filter bubbles and demonstrate that these bubbles exert a greater influence on search results over time. Moreover, we explored potential solutions to mitigate the influence of filter bubbles, proposing methods to promote a more diverse and inclusive information ecosystem. Our findings underscore the significance of filter bubbles in shaping users' access to information and highlight the urgency of addressing this issue to prevent further political polarization and media habit entrenchment. Through this research, we contribute to a broader understanding of the challenges posed by personalized digital environments and offer insights into strategies that can help alleviate the risks of intellectual isolation caused by filter bubbles."

Notably, crossword puzzles are used to reinforce vocabulary retention.Third, the study highlights the incorporation of age-appropriate North Korean pop culture content as a means to facilitate effective vocabulary acquisition and retention among middle school students. This content ranges from Aesop’s fables and traditional fairy tales to contemporary North Korean video materials, reflecting North Korea’s cultural isolationism and international isolation through the incorporation of proper nouns and culturemes in the educational material. A distinctive aspect of vocabulary instruction includes utilizing the Russian language as a medium for idolization and merging Russian language learning with political ideology education.Finally, despite North Korea’s cultural isolationism and a general resistance to Western culture, the Russian language textbooks demonstrate a certain degree of openness towards Russian, Western, and global cultures. This indicates that Russian language education targeting gifted and talented middle school students during the Kim Jong Il era might be considered part of an initiative to broaden cultural understanding and international viewpoints."

The authoritarian regime, rooted in nationalism, established and employed Koreanness, which subsequently dictated the trajectory of cultural policy. Setting the parameters of 'Korean-ness' within the realm of visual culture aimed at binding citizens to the nation through shared images reinforced by repetitive learning. Simultaneously, this endeavor sought to generate value through visual differentiation from other cultures. The burgeoning industrialization and export-oriented economic policies particularly fueled interest in design, notably from the perspectives of packaging and promotion. Designers such as Kim Gyo-man, Na Jae-o, and Jeong Yeon-jong, who were actively engaged during that period, actively produced visual outcomes centered around the Koreanness constructed by the state. The necessity for such Korean design and exemplary instances were conveyed to students through textbooks. However, while textbooks aimed at visualizing the spirit of nationalism, they often failed to present innovative, concrete methodologies, or examples related to it. The application of tradition to modern sensibilities was predominantly left as a task for students."

This study aims to investigate effectiveness of dance music education applying compre- hensive musicianship, a major music education concept emphasizing creativity, synthesis and diversity. The result of the study can be summarized in following four categories.First, ‘expanded repertory’ of dance music will contribute to accurate ex- ecution and expressiveness of dance movements, and therefore help students to achieve high level of performance, as well as broad range of musical knowledge for choreographic capability. Second, ‘musicality development’ by dance music education will provide specialized music concept learning and re-organizing pro- cess, so that students can discover and apply the common factors of music and dance into their work.  Third, ‘synthesis reinforcement’ will motivate students to find the connection between subjects of differing fields, leading them to grow as artists with various perspectives. And last, ‘creativity enhancement’ comes from learning and experiencing musical materials, contents, sentiments and images.  Such extension of knowledge and experiments will bring about imagination and creativeness in dance.Dance music education, when grafted with comprehensive musicianship, is expected to result in improved and specialized musicality acquisition for dance students. Therefore, it is highly recommendable to apply these principles and cre- ate curriculum which can be implemented in arts high school scene in the near future. Through such dance music educational program, we will be able to see more young dancers, choreographers and dance teachers with excellent technique, artistry and originality."

Methods: This study utilized a quasi-experimental design with nonequivalent control group pre-post tests. The study was conducted in November 2024, targeting 31 second-year nursing students from a university in the G region (15 in the experimental and 16 in the control group). The experimental group participated in a four-week infection control education program (once a week, 2 hours per session), while the control group received no intervention. The effects of the education were evaluated through pre-and-post-surveys measuring infection control knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behaviors. Results: The infection control education program significantly improved nursing students' infection control knowledge (t=-3.29, p=.005). However, no significant changes were observed in infection control attitudes or preventive behaviors, suggesting that changes in attitudes and behaviors require more than short-term education and may need repetitive and long-term learning environment with reinforcement.

"Using topic modeling-based network visualization and generative AI in online discussions, how learners' perception of usability affects their reflection on feedback",2024,"['Online discussions', 'Topic modeling', 'Generative AI', 'Learner reflection', 'Feedback usability']",,"This study aims to analyze the impact of learners' usability perceptions of topic modeling-based visual feedback and generative AI interpretation on reflection levels in online discussions. To achieve this, we asked 17 students in the Department of Korean language education to conduct an online discussion. Text data generated from online discussions were analyzed using LDA topic modeling to extract five clusters of related words, or topics. These topics were then visualized in a network format, and interpretive feedback was constructed through generative AI. The feedback was presented on a website and rated highly for usability, with learners valuing its information usefulness. Furthermore, an analysis using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test based on levels of usability perception revealed that the group with higher perceived usability demonstrated higher levels of reflection. This suggests that well-designed and user-friendly visual feedback can significantly promote deeper reflection and engagement in online discussions. The integration of topic modeling and generative AI can enhance visual feedback in online discussions, reinforcing the efficacy of such feedback in learning. The research highlights the educational significance of these design strategies and clears a path for innovation."

The processing of thermal images at multiple scales has been challenging due to the limitations of existing methods that are designed for specific scales. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a unified framework that utilizes cascade feature fusion to effectively learn multi-scale representations. Confidence maps from different image scales are fused in a cascaded manner, enabling scale-invariant learning. The architecture comprises end-to-end trained convolutional neural networks to enhance image quality by reinforcing mutual scale dependencies. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique outperforms existing methods in multi-scale thermal image enhancement. Performance evaluation results are provided, demonstrating consistent improvements in image quality metrics. The cascade fusion design facilitates robust generalization across scales and efficient learning of cross-scale representations."

The Evolution of Phenomenology in Korean Nursing Research: A Scoping Review,2024,['methodological studies nursing research philosophy qualitative research'],,"Purpose Phenomenological methods are used to capture human experience, and nursing research has long attempted phenomenological approaches in many studies. This study explored the 22-year trends (2001– 2022) in phenomenological research within Korean nursing science and identified the types of journals where research is published, common phenomenological data analysis methods, phenomena of interest, and standards of rigor applied to phenomenological studies.Methods This scoping review followed the six stages recommended by Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) and utilized the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) for reporting guidance. A total of 4,354 articles acquired through systematic searches across seven search engines PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Research Information Sharing Service (RISS), Korea Citation Index (KCI), Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI), and Korean studies Information Service System (KISS) were reviewed. Key search terms and inclusion and exclusion criteria were used as strategies to identify relevant articles.Results In the final review, 568 Korean phenomenological studies were included. Among the phenomenology research, 50.4% of the total work was performed between 2016 and 2020, and the Colaizzi method of study was the most common (62.9%). Most researchers were published in nursing journals (55.8%). Nurses constituted the majority of participants (24.5%), followed by people living with illnesses (23.1%) and people of all ages. The primary focus included participants' experiences: the disease experience of the sick, the job-related experience of the nurses, and the learning-related experience of the nursing students. The median sample size of reviewed papers (i.e., 9) is relevant to phenomenological research saturation. The most rigorous studies applied Lincoln and Guba's criteria (54.0%).Conclusions Advancing phenomenological research in nursing entails giving priority to diverse perspectives, rigor, and the foundational essence of phenomenology. Ensuring transparency and reliability requires reinforcing rigor through the integration of phenomenology, philosophy, and effective data analysis methods."
디지털 미디어의 시대 비판적 사고의 위기 다시 생각하기 : 청소년 학업성취도 비교를 중심으로,2024,"['디지털 미디어', '비판적 사고', 'PISA', '읽기', '수학', '과학', 'digital media', 'critical thinking', 'PISA', 'reading', 'Mathematics', 'Science']","본 연구는 디지털 미디어 시대에 비판적 사고가 위기에 처했다는 일반적인 믿음에 의문을 제기한다. 이 믿음은 코로나 팬데믹 기간에 강화되었으며, 교육자들은 학생들의 성취도 하락에 초점을 맞추는 다양한 연구 결과를 제시하고 있다. 또한 이러한 성취도 하락이 비판적 사고의 위기로 이어질 것이라는 우려도 다양하게 제기되고 있다. 이 연구는 이러한 우려에 반하는 증거와 이론적 근거를 제시하고자 한다. 한국, 일본, 대만, 홍콩, 싱가폴 등 PISA 상위 5개국의 데이터를 검토한 결과는 다음과 같다. 읽기 점수는 변하지 않았고 수학 점수는 약간 상승했으며 과학 점수는 상당히 상승했다. 이를 통해 다음 내용을 주장한다. (1) 읽기는 텍스트 기반 활동이며, 수학과 과학은 텍스트와 시각 매체를 모두 포함한다. (2) 읽기는 읽고 쓰는 능력을 평가하고, 수학은 연역 논증을 평가하며, 과학은 귀납 논증을 평가한다. (3) 비판적 사고는 연역 논증과 귀납 논증 두 가지로 구성된다. (4) 연역 논증과 귀납 논증 역량은 텍스트에만 의존하고 의도적인 학습이 필요한 읽기와는 달리 부분적으로 선천적인 것이다. (5) 인간은 선천적으로 연역 논증을 하는 경향이 있지만, 추상적인 상황에서 이를 적용하는 역량은 약하고 오류가 발생하기 쉽다. 이 역량은 적절한 학습을 통해 향상될 수 있다. 또한 인간은 선천적으로 귀납 논증을 하는 경향이 있으며, 다양한 감각을 자극하는 멀티미디어를 사용함으로써 이 역량은 상당히 향상된다. 디지털 미디어는 읽기에서 성취도에 영향을 거의 미치지 않지만, 수학에서 약간의 성취도 향상을 가져오고 과학에서는 상당한 성취도 향상을 가져올 수 있다. 이러한 결과는 상위 5개국의 PISA 수행 결과에 반영되어 있다. 결론적으로 디지털 미디어를 활용함으로써 읽기 역량은 퇴보를 막을 수 있고 연역 논증과 귀납 논증으로 구성된 비판적 사고력은 상당한 수준에서 향상을 기대할 수 있다고 추론할 수 있다.","This study challenges the widespread belief that critical thinking is in crisis in the digital media age. This belief has been reinforced during the COVID-19 pandemic, with educators increasingly focusing on declining student achievement and expressing concern that this decline will lead to a crisis in critical thinking. This study presents evidence and theoretical arguments that contradict these concerns.The results of a review of PISA performance data from the top five countries showed the following: Reading scores remained unchanged. Math scores showed a slight increase. Science scores showed a significant increase.Discussion: (1) Reading is a text-based activity, while math and science involve both text and visual media. (2) Reading assesses literacy, math assesses deductive reasoning, and science assesses inductive reasoning. (3) Deductive and inductive reasoning are two components of critical thinking. (4) Unlike reading, which relies solely on text and requires deliberate learning to improve, deductive and inductive reasoning abilities are partially innate. (5) While humans are naturally predisposed to deductive reasoning, their ability to apply it in abstract situations can be weak and prone to errors. However, this ability can be improved with appropriate learning. Humans are also naturally predisposed to inductive reasoning, and this ability can be significantly enhanced by using multi media that stimulate various senses. While digital media has little impact on achievement in reading, it can slightly improve achievement in math and significantly improve achievement in science. These findings are reflected in the PISA performance results of the top five countries.Conclusion: The use of digital media can prevent the decline of reading skills and significantly improve critical thinking skills, which are comprised of deductive and inductive reasoning."

BL의 계보에서 볼때, 오메가버스는 남성도 임신이 가능하다는 도발 등을 통해 기존 성 체계를 무너뜨리는 전복적 세계관을 드러내며, 다양한 순애와 탐미의 조합을 통해 향유자의 요구를 적극적으로 반영한다는 점에서 진화형 BL의 성공적인 성격화라 볼 수 있다. 그러나 BL 전반적인 연구와 마찬가지로 오메가버스 관련 연구는 산업적 규모에 비해상대적으로 적은 편이며, 여성주의적 관점을 견지하거나 성 소수자와 연관된 사회 문화적 인식과 연동돼 있어가변적인 오메가버스 설정을 충분히 설명하지 못하고 있다. 따라서 BL의 진화라는 시점에서 오메가버스의 현재적 양상을 규명하기 위해 스토리텔링 전략을 살펴볼 것이다. 오메가버스의 특성이 실제 텍스트에서 어떻게 구현되고 있으며 향유자들이 어떻게 즐기는지를 탐색하기 위해서는 전형성과 유연성 측면에 주목한다. 오메가버스의 전형성은 오메가버스의 정체성을 이루는 기본적인 설정값으로, 서사를 구현하기 위한 노력을 최소화하고 주어진 캐릭터성을 강화하는 것이다. 그 결과 오메가버스의 공수 캐릭터는 감정적으로 순애의 극단을 지향하지만표현 기제인 성애 묘사는 훨씬 자극적이고 집요한 양상으로 나타난다. 오메가버스는 전형성만으로도 자족적인향유 요소를 충분히 갖고 있지만 유연성 요소와의 상생적인 조합을 개방적으로 조형하는 특성을 지닌다. 유연성은 합의된 세계관 외에 다른 향유 요소와 결합하는 것으로, 유연성이 높을수록 향유 요소도 다양해진다. 그 결과각 텍스트들은 고유성을 확보하고, 향유자들은 여러 선택지를 갖게 된다. 구체적으로 텍스트들을 비교해 보면, 초기에는 신선하고 특이한 세계관 자체가 주된 향유 요소로 작용했지만, 텍스트가 풍부해질수록 향유자들은 BL의 선행 학습을 바탕으로 차별성을 즐기고자 함을 확인할 수 있다. 오메가버스는 종종 BL의 한계로 지적되는 빈약한 서사와 반복되는 성애의 탐닉에 대한 식상함을 극복하기 위한 다양한 시도라는 점에서 발전 가능성이 높다고 전망할 수 있다.","Omegaverse is a compound of omega + universe, and is a subgenre of BL in which humanity is divided into alpha, beta, and omega traits, and alphas can impregnate omegas regardless of gender, and are differentiated by setting up periods such as rut and hit. From the perspective of BL's genealogy, Omegaverse can be considered a successful characterization of evolutionary BL in that it reveals a subversive worldview that breaks down the existing gender system by provoking that men can also become pregnant, and actively reflects the needs of the viewer through various combinations of chastity and taste. However, as with BL research in general, there is relatively little studies on the Omegaverse compared to the size of the industry. These studies are often tied to feminist perspectives or socio-cultural perceptions associated with LGBTQ+ people and therefore they do not adequately account for variable omegaverse settings. Therefore, we will examine the storytelling strategies to identify the current state of Omegaverse at this point in BL's evolution.To explore how the characterization of the omegaverse is embodied in actual texts and how it is enjoyed by audiences, we focus on the aspects of archetypality and flexibility. The archetypes of the Omegaverse are the basic settings that form the identity of the Omegaverse, minimizing the effort to implement the narrative and reinforcing the given characterization. As a result, while the airborne characters in OmegaBus are emotionally oriented towards the extreme of chastity, the portrayal of sexuality as an expressive mechanism is much more provocative and relentless. The Omegaverse has enough elements of archetypality to be self-sufficient, but it is also open to symbiotic combinations with elements of flexibility. Flexibility is the combination of tropes outside of the agreed-upon worldview, and the more flexible the tropes, the more diverse the tropes. As a result, each text gains uniqueness, and the enjoyers have multiple options. Specifically, if we compare the texts, we can see that while the fresh and unusual worldview itself was the main enjoyment factor in the beginning, as the texts became richer, the enjoyers sought to enjoy their differences based on BL's prior learning. Omegaverse's various attempts to overcome the weak narrative and repetitive sexual indulgence that are often pointed out as BL's limitations suggest that it has a lot of potential for development."

In particular, poetry and painting based on visuality are often used in convergence classes. However, despite the goal of broadening the scope of literary works through genre convergence, there is criticism that convergence classes are not adequately implemented in actual educational settings. This is partly due to the instructional designs, which fail to integrate art subjects into convergence classes as they rather focus on understanding and teaching the characteristics of both genres within the limited timeframe of Korean language classes. Therefore, this study attempts to present a teaching method for comprehensively understanding and educating students about poetry and art within the convergence class of literature and art, while critically examining current textbook activities.

To this end, a survey was conducted on university students in Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do, using the student adaptation to university questionnaire, career preparation behavior, and learning agility scales. 163 data collected were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 21.0 program. The analysis results are as follows. First, adaptation to university life did not have a significant effect on career preparation behavior, which is different from previous studies. It is expected to be due to the difference between the measurement tools and it was targeted at Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do. Second, adaptation to university life had a significant effect on learning agility. Third, learning agility had a significant effect on career preparation behavior. Finally, learning agility completely mediated between adaptation to university life and career preparation behavior. According to this, even if adaptation to university life is high, it may not take career preparation behavior, but college students with high learning agility can reinforce career preparation behavior through adaptation to university life. This suggests that learning agility plays a key role in linking adaptation to university life and career preparation behavior among university students. In other words, to enhance career preparation behavior in university students, it is necessary to improve their level of learning agility. Therefore, to increase learning agility, educators should create an interactive learning environment where students can freely express their opinions and share their learning experiences. Furthermore, at the institutional level, university should makes career planning courses mandatory to provide students with opportunities to reflect on and prepare for their career paths. Based on these findings, the study presents implications and suggestions for future research."

In such areas, the use of multi-legged robots with lower ground contact is more suitable. However, there is a lack of research on robot control mechanisms capable of responding quickly to unexpected situations like leg loss in multi-legged robots. This study focuses on developing control models and reinforcement learning strategies to enable rapid adaptation to leg loss during the movement of multi-legged robots designed for mine detection. The MA-POCA(Multi Agent-Posthumous Credit Assignment) algorithm, one of multi-agent algorithms in reinforcement learning, is employed for this purpose. Additionally, a simulation model and environment are created using Unity and the ML-Agents library to facilitate the rapid learning of unforeseen damage scenarios during robot operations in the DMZ. To address this challenge, each agent within the multi-agent group is assigned to control one leg of the multi-legged robot and is trained as an independent agent using CTDE (Centralized Training via Decentralized Estimation). This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional supervised learning methods and is empirically shown to be effective. Notably, the article highlights that the gait developed using the MA-POCA algorithm, focusing on control and reinforcement learning for lost legs during walking, distinguishes itself from other algorithms primarily focused on multi-legged robot locomotion. This unique approach allows for adaptation to critical situations that may occur during mine-clearance operations in the DMZ, suggesting potential improvements in mission efficiency, particularly in rapidly changing situations."
TD3 Algorithm of Dynamic Classification Replay Buffer Based PID Parameter Optimization,2024,"['Deep reinforcement learning', 'intelligent optimization', 'PID parameter optimization', 'twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3).']",,"In industrial control, PID controllers are widely used, but their control performance depends heavily on the parameters of the controller. However, the adjustment of PID controller parameters is cumbersome and inefficient. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has been gradually introduced into the industrial control field due to its advantage of being able to learn autonomously by interacting with the environment. In this paper, a PID parameter optimization method based on TD3 algorithm of dynamic classification replay buffer (DCRB-TD3) is proposed. By designing the optimization framework, the optimization process of the PID parameters is converted into the learning process of the weights of the actor network. In order to improve the learning efficiency of the reinforcement learning algorithm, avoid the phenomenon of control curve dispersion and ensure that the whole process can be continuously closed-loop optimized. In this paper, the regular TD3 algorithm is improved, a dynamic classification ratio strategy is designed, and a sampling update method for dynamic classification experience replay is proposed. Finally, simulations are performed on various systems, and DCRB-TD3 is compared with the PID parameter optimization method based on the PSO algorithm. The results show that the PID parameters optimized by DCRB-TD3 have better control performance than other methods."
UAV Coverage Path Planning With Limited Battery Energy Based on Improved Deep Double Q-network,2024,"['Battery limitation', 'coverage path planning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'dynamic soft update.']",,"In response to the increasingly complex problem of patrolling urban areas, the utilization of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) coverage path planning (CPP) has gradually become a research hotspot. CPP’s solution needs to consider several complex factors, including landing area, target area coverage and limited battery capacity. Consequently, based on incomplete environmental information, policy learned by sample inefficient deep reinforcement learning algorithms are prone to getting trapped in local optima. To enhance the quality of experience data, a novel reward is proposed to guide UAVs in efficiently traversing the target area under battery limitations. Subsequently, to improve the sample efficiency of deep reinforcement learning algorithms, this paper introduces a novel dynamic soft update method, incorporates the prioritized experience replay mechanism, and presents an improved deep double Q-network (IDDQN) algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments conducted on two different grid maps demonstrate that IDDQN outperforms DDQN significantly.

Optimizing Energy Efficiency in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: An Intelligent Multi-Objective Routing Approach,2024,"['Q-routing', 'ad-hoc networks', 'Multi-objective routing', 'Adaptive routing']",,"Mobile ad hoc networks represent self-configuring networks of mobile devices that communicate without relying on a fixed infrastructure. However, traditional routing protocols in such networks encounter challenges in selecting efficient and reliable routes due to dynamic nature of these networks caused by unpredictable mobility of nodes. This often results in a failure to meet the low-delay and low-energy consumption requirements crucial for such networks. In order to overcome such challenges, our paper introduces a novel multi-objective and adaptive routing scheme based on the Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed routing scheme dynamically adjusts itself based on measured network states, such as traffic congestion and mobility. The proposed approach utilizes Q-learning to select routes in a decentralized manner, considering factors like energy consumption, load balancing, and the selection of stable links. We present a formulation of the multi-objective optimization problem and discuss adaptive adjustments of the Q-learning parameters to handle the dynamic nature of the network. To speed up the learning process, our scheme incorporates informative shaped rewards, providing additional guidance to the learning agents for better solutions. Implemented on the widely-used AODV routing protocol, our proposed approaches demonstrate better performance in terms of energy efficiency and improved message delivery delay, even in highly dynamic network environments, when compared to the traditional AODV. These findings show the potential of leveraging reinforcement learning for efficient routing in ad hoc networks, making the way for future advancements in the field of mobile ad hoc networking."

However, research investigating RL-based structural control techniques in particular is still in an early stage. In RL algorithms, the agent interacts with the environment by taking the appropriate action under the specifi c state. In the RL-based structural control problem, the environment usually includes the structure, control system, external loads, etc., and it is generally presented by the fi nite element model. In the present study, the Unity game engine— which has recently come to be used in various engineering simulations because of its accurate physics calculations—was used to construct a reinforcement learning environment for structural control systems. A smart base isolation system (SBIS) that was composed of a magnetorheological damper and four friction pendulum systems was used as an example structural control system, and it was modeled using the Unity physics engine for RL environment. Among various RL algorithms, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) was used to make the control algorithm for the SBIS. The command voltage for the smart base isolation was mapped into the agent’s action. The reward of the DQN algorithm was designed to be a higher value when the agent takes a better action resulting in reduced seismic responses. Three artifi cial ground motions were used to train the DQN-based control algorithm, and another artifi cial earthquake was used to investigate the control effi ciency of the trained DQN-based control algorithm. The passive-on case with the maximum damper force was used for comparative study. This study shows that the DQN-based algorithm can successfully control the SBIS. The fi ndings show that the unity game engine can accurately present the dynamic responses of the SBIS, showing that it can be eff ectively used for the construction of a RL environment for structural dynamic systems."

This is intensed in the photo process, which is the bottleneck process of the LCD manufacturing system. In addition, it is difficult to get a high-quality schedule because there is a trade-off between the elements constituting the KPI(Key Performance Indicator), which are the objective functions in the photo process. To solve this problem, this study proposes an A3C-based distributed learning framework. The proposed framework is designed to assign tasks in consideration of the interrelationships between the facilities by placing local agents in each facility. In addition, all tasks that can be assigned using the pointer network can be input as a state, allowing more accurate state observation and task allocation. As a result of the experiment, the proposed model recorded a higher KPI than the heuristic and existing reinforcement learning models by making a schedule that evenly considered all factors, although the individual elements constituting the KPI were not superior to other models."

Typically, container stowage plans are manually created by planners who consider factors such as destination, size, type, and weight of the  cargo,  making  the  process  time-consuming  and  error-prone.  To  address  this  issue,  we employed the DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm, a type of reinforcement learning, to establish an optimal container stowage plan. We proposed a method for defining state using the character- istics of the containers and compared it with traditional methods, using constraints such as desti- nation port and weight. The state definition method proposed in this study has the advantage of not exponentially increasing the number of states with the size of the stowage space by using characteristic values related to the loading status of each row. Initially, the performance of the DQN algorithm was verified using destination port as the only constraint. Subsequently, weight constraints were added to the state definition method that showed better performance. The study results show that the proposed method successfully established a stowage plan that satisfies all constraints in a 4×4 stowage space without causing re-handles, across nine test container lists."

The approach is based on a holistic design of experiments and identifies good state design baselines for further fine-tuning tasks while concurrently analyzing various factor combination effects. The framework efficiently explores all possible state designs influenced by input variables using a metamodel. A 2-level fractional factorial design and regression model is used to collect specific variable combinations, maximizing prediction accuracy of responses for remaining factor combinations.

Therefore, in this study, a plan to evaluate the safety of navigation through ship control simulation was proposed in a maritime environment, where ships directly controlled by navigators and autonomous ships coexisted, using autonomous operation technology. Own ship was designed to have autonomous operational functions by learning the MMG model based on the six-DOF motion with the PPO algorithm, an in-depth reinforcement learning technique. The target ship constructed maritime traffic modeling data based on the maritime traffic data of the sea area to be evaluated and designed autonomous operational functions to be implemented in a simulation space. A numerical model was established by collecting date on tide, wave, current, and wind from the maritime meteorological database. A maritime meteorology model was created based on this and designed to reproduce maritime meteorology on the simulator.

Scores on the Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure, the Academic Motivation Scale, and the Basic MedicalScience Examination were used to measure overall learning environment perceptions, intrinsic motivation, and academic performance, respectively. Serial mediation analysis was conducted to examine the pathways between the grading system and academic performance, focusing on the mediating roles of studentperceptions and intrinsic motivation.Results: The honors/pass/fail grading class students reported more positive perceptions of the learning environment, higher intrinsic motivation, and betteracademic performance than the A–F grading class students. Mediation analysis demonstrated a serial mediation effect between the grading system and academic performance through learning environment perceptions and intrinsic motivation. Student perceptions and intrinsic motivation did not independently mediate the relationship between the grading system and performance.Conclusion: Reducing the number of grades and eliminating rank-based grading might have created an affirming learning environment that fulfills basic psychological needs and reinforces the intrinsic motivation linked to academic performance. The cumulative effect of these 2 mediators suggests that a comprehensive approach should be used to understand student performance."

Instead of static AI that plays games based solely on data coded in advance by game producers, an AI character created based on the play of a real user has emerged that is very similar to his game play through a reinforcement learning algorithm by itself, and the similarity is increasing.However, the development of AI is expected to cause both light and cancer in the e-sports industry. This is because with the development of Generative AI, the possibility of AI doping, in which users learn the play method of a specific person who has better game skills than them, and the AI helps or replaces the user's play, is emerging.AI doping, which we want to argue in this paper, refers to the use of AI that has learned the play of various people in official competitions.

The proportional stratified sampling method was applied, and 385 responses were used in the final analysis. The collected data were analyzed using t-test, one-way ANOVA, Borich educational needs analysis, and The Locus For Focus model.The results of the study are as follows. First, the perception of vocational high school specialized subject teachers regarding their teaching competency showed that the overall average performance was 3.51 and the overall average importance was 4.10, and the importance was higher than the performance in all sub-competencies, confirming the need to further improve the sub-competencies. In particular, the learner-tailored teaching and learning design and implementation competency (group) was recognized as highly important and performant, but the importance and performance of the digital technology class utilization competency (group) and the industry-academia-linked teaching and learning design and implementation competency (group) were relatively low. There were significant differences in the importance and performance of some teaching competency depending on the background variables of the teacher (industry work experience, teaching career, participation in the teacher learning community). Second, as a result of the education needs analysis, the industry-academia-linked teaching and learning design competency was identified as the top priority, and the competency for promoting higher-order thinking ability cultivation, the competency for analyzing digital technology changes in the industrial field, the competency for implementing industry-academia-linked hybrid classes, and the competency for responding to changes in the vocational education environment were identified as second priorities. In conclusion, restructuring the teaching competency of specialized subject teachers is necessary for vocational education innovation in the digital transformation era. To this end, strengthening the educational utilization competencies of digital technology, reinforcing industry-academia-linked education, and supporting teacher retraining are required, and the establishment of an AI-based teaching design support system capable of individual learner data analysis and learning support and the development of AI digital specialized subject textbooks should be considered. In addition, a differentiated support strategy that takes into account the career and background of teachers is needed, and a metaverse-based industry-academia convergence education platform and an AI coaching system to develop teachers' teaching capabilities are also needed."

As a learning tool, ChagePiti should be used through the learners independent and active participation while the learner takes the lead in the creation process. In this paper, we explored the possibility through a personalized correction list based on learner needs and a learner-led feedback prompt.  In order to effectively utilize Chageffiti in sentence correction, it is necessary to clearly understand not only the principles and standards of sentence correction, but also the task requirements and task evaluation standards. Learners should be able to participate in the generation process step by step and make specific demands, and the basis for this was organized through the correction contents of the ‘Sogang University Writing Center’. In addition, a feedback prompt was designed to select, judge, and coordinate the results of sentence correction by referring to Ethan Mollick and Lilach Mollicks AI feedback model so that learners can use Chageffiti led by their leadership. This prompt reinforces the learning experience of learners participating in the generation process by comparing before and after sentence correction while showing the generation results step by step through the learners active demand.  In order to effectively utilize ChatGPT as a tool led by learners in future writing classes at universities, instructors should be guided to use various learning tools in an integrated manner. In addition, self-directed learning skills should be improved by allowing them to participate in the creation process step by step based on the needs of learners and critically reviewing the selection of the generated results in actual use."

It is analyzed and suggested that the Buddhist system of thinking in the Samje Weonyung(三諦圓融) is in close contact with the ideology of the Tao Te Ching and the Bayes Theorem, one of the learning algorithms of artificial intelligence. This is an attempt to explore the convergent implications of the Buddhist way of thinking inherent in the scriptures represented by Yeosiamun(如是我聞), that is to say, from the current perspective, it is an attempt to reconstruct the view of the Hearing(聞) of Yeosiamun(如是我聞) into the wheel of the dharmacakra-pravartana(如是我轉) in line with the innovation of modern science and technology, as well as to reveal the strategic value of the Middle Path with the manifestation of Yeosiajeon(如是我顯).Based on those recognition, this study newly present the strategic value of the Buddhist thinking system from two perspectives. First, by revealing that in light of Chapter 1 of the Tao Te Ching, the Tao(道) is referred to as having the characteristics of Ga(可), and it is clarified that Tao's properties are variable, and that Tao operates as a significant interdependence between Mu(無) as a potential world and Yu(有) as a phenomenal world. In this way, it is judged that the principle of operation of Tao(道), which works as an interdependence between Mu(無) and Yu(有), can be easily passed on as a thinking system of the Samje Weonyung(三諦圓融). Tao(道) is defined as a Ga(可), that is, change itself, which is equivalent to the principle of Muwi-MuBulwi(無爲無不爲). It is reasonable to estimate that it also can be interpreted as the three principles of the Middle Path that play a major rule as a strategic framework for the Buddhist thinking system.Second, Bays Theorem, one of the AI algorithms defined as another consciousness, is also a decision-making theory that abandons subjectivity and moves toward objectivity, not just a computer operating system. It has been shown that the process can be subsumed into the three principles of the Middle Path in that it is a learning method that constantly modifies the intellectual system of consciousness based on observation, data, and events. The reasoning of this paper is that the prior probability of Bays Theorem can be represented as a framework for divided thinking, and that the total probability can be determined as a Gong(空), the likelihood probability as a Ga(假), and the posterior probability as a Jung(中). It can be said that it is a process of dismantling the discriminated cognition system caused by the fixed frame and fringe limitations through Gong(空), presenting an updated direction based on this, and realizing the Middle Path. It can be confirmed that the same mechanism of operation as AI's deep learning and reinforcement learning methods interact with the Middle Path thinking system."

The trained model demonstrated an R-squared value of 0.99 and a mean squared error of 0.00093, indicating excellent performance. For untrained flange radii, the spring-back predicted by the DNN exhibited a mean relative error of 2.18% when compared to FEM results.

Blockchain-Enabled Lightweight Intrusion Detection System for Secure MANETs,2024,['Actor-critic network  · Reinforcement learning  · Hybrid authentication  · MANET'],,"In this study, we provide a novel method dubbed BL-IDS, which makes use of a decentralized Blockchain network to power a minimal intrusion detection system (IDS) for MANETs. The unique infrastructure-less nature of MANETs poses challenges in developing an eff ective and reliable IDS. Our proposed solution addresses these challenges by incorporating several key elements. First, we employ a hybrid authentication mechanism to authenticate network nodes, ensuring a secure environment. Authenticated nodes are then allowed to form clusters based on a similarity index (SI), facilitating effi cient communication and routing within the network. To optimize routing, we introduce the wild horse optimization algorithm, which considers multiple metrics to select the most optimal route. To detect and mitigate intrusions, we propose the deep actor-critic learning (DAC) approach. This algorithm learns features from network packets through the Blockchain, which serves as a monitoring system for data transmission. If an intrusion is detected, the DAC algorithm updates the network with feedback, enabling prompt response and resolution. By combining these algorithms, our proposed approach achieves improved effi ciency in various metrics, including PDR, throughput, time analysis, detection accuracy, and security level.The results demonstrate the eff ectiveness of our lightweight IDS driven by a decentralized Blockchain network in enhancing the overall performance and security of MANETs."

Autonomous Defense of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Against Missile Attacks Using a GRU-Based PPO Algorithm,2024,"['unmanned aerial vehicle', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'decision-making', 'centroid jamming']",,"This paper introduces a method enabling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously defend themselves against incoming missiles during military missions. A simulation environment for UAV defense against incoming missiles was created by constructing motion models for a UAV, a missile, and infrared decoys in three-dimensional space. A UAV defense strategy generation algorithm based on gated recurrent unit (GRU) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) is proposed, which effectively addresses the problem of low survival rates when under attack from enemy missiles. Specifically, the algorithm estimates the current true state based on current and historical observations and makes decisions based on the state estimate, effectively solving the non-Markov problem caused by the lack of infrared decoy information in the observations. The experimental results indicate that this method provides an effective defense strategy, combining evasion maneuvers with infrared decoys to effectively evade incoming missiles."

However, a delay occurred in processing and returning results to user requests, a phenomenon referred to as the cold start problem. This paper proposed the Time Warming Allocation Engine (TWAE) to improve resource management and mitigate the cold start problem in Function as a Service. The proposed engine comprised a collection module, a learning module, a classification module, and an allocation module. Additionally, it utilized a list called Pre-Warming. Through this approach, it suggested directions for improving cold start issues and resource utilization according to different time periods."

Fine-grained states with two delicate neural networks are proposed to optimize the sequencing of EVs and charging station (CS) arrangement. Two efficient algorithms are presented to obtain the optimal EVs charging scheduling scheme for large-scale EVs charging demand. Three case studies show the superiority of our proposal, in terms of a high service quality (minimized average queuing time of EVs and maximized charging performance at both EV and CS sides) and achieve greater scheduling efficiency.

This analysis included 1,150 videos from KBS’s “The World Now”(November 2019 to October 2023), with 236 videos about disasters. We identified countries from the collected videos and measured the development levels of 103 countries based on the Human Development Index (HDI). Furthermore, we extracted 25,317 key-frames from disaster videos and classified them into eight types by employing an image classifier we developed based on Vision Transformer. Results of the video-level analysis revealed that countries with higher development levels in North America and Europe, as well as conflict-ridden countries, tended to have more videos. In contrast, disaster video ratios were higher in coverage related to the third-world, such as Africa. This implies that quantitative inequality and qualitative bias persist in international news, depending on the country’s development level. In a frame-level analysis, disaster videos about the third-world featured more images of human damage. Sensational reporting, focusing on evoking emotions rather than fostering a nuanced understanding of disasters, was evident through the vivid portrayal of victims. This indicates a deviation from the norms of disaster reporting, taking advantage of the lack of protection for victims in the third-world. As Susan Sontag pointed out, it can be argued that such reporting, through the everyday consumption of ‘pains of others’, reinforces the spread of apathy and indifference towards the sufferings without practical engagement."

To simulate future states in ahigh-dimensional action space with infinite action candidates, the knowledge ofone’s decision making strategy must be used to sample candidate actions to beexplored. We refer to the model used to simulate one’s decisions as the agent’sself-model. While self-models are often implicitly used in planning, it remainsunclear how self-models should be designed. Inspired by current reinforcementlearning approaches and neuroscience, we explore the benefits and limitations ofusing a distilled policy network as the self-model. In such dual-policy agents, amodel-free policy and a distilled policy are used for model-free actions and plannedactions, respectively. Our results on a ecologically relevant, parametric environmentindicate that distilled policy network for self-model stabilizes training, has fasterinference than using model-free policy, promotes better exploration, and could learna comprehensive understanding of its own behaviors, at the cost of distilling a newnetwork apart from the model-free policy."

In this research, a novel DRL algorithm, i.e. an improved soft actor-critic (ISAC) algorithm is applied to the EMS of a fuel cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV), in which the priority experience replay (PER) and emphasizing recent experience (ERE) methods are adopted to improve the convergence performance of the algorithm and to enhance the FCHV fuel economy. In addition, the fuel cell durability is also considered in the proposed EMS based on a nonlinear fuel cell degradation model while considering the fuel economy. Results indicate that the FCHV fuel consumption of the proposed EMS is decreased by 7.87%, 2.79%, and 2.44% compared to that of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based, the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3)-based, and the SAC-based EMSs respectively while the fuel consumption gap to the dynamic programming-based EMS is narrowed to 2.37% by the proposed EMS. Moreover, the proposed EMS presents the best training performance considering both the convergence speed and stability, and the convergence speed of the proposed EMS is increased by an average of 47.89% compared to that of the other DRL-based EMSs. Furthermore, the fuel cell durability is improved by more than 95% using the proposed EMS compared to that of the EMS without considering the fuel cell degradation."
대졸 청년 고용형태 예측요인 탐색연구: Elastic Net 분석기법을 활용하여,2024,"['Young Adults', 'Employment Types', 'Employment and Labor Policy', 'Machine Learning', 'Elastic Net', '청년', '고용형태', '고용노동정책', '머신러닝', 'Elastic Net']",,"In today’s rapidly evolving society, young adults face heightened exposure to the precarious nature of labor markets, intensifying their pursuit of stable employment through securing permanent positions. This demographic is particularly affected by the dual structure of the labor market, which is bifurcated into a primary segment characterized by high wages and job security, and a secondary segment marked by low wages and job instability. The lack of upward mobility between these two segments presents critical societal challenges, reinforcing structural inequality and limiting economic opportunity.Against this backdrop, the present study endeavors to predict the employment types of college-educated young adults by leveraging data from the Youth Panel 2007 (YP 2007).Specifically, the study organizes 89 variables from the youth panel dataset into four key predictive categories: individual characteristics, job-related attributes, motivational factors, and human capital indicators. To achieve robust predictive accuracy, the study employs the Logistic Elastic Net model, a regression-based machine learning method well-suited for handling high-dimensional data.By analyzing the predictive outcomes, this study aims to offer actionable policy recommendations for youth employment, education, and labor market reform. Additionally, it seeks to provide practical guidance for higher education institutions in preparing students for the complex dynamics of contemporary labor markets. Through these contributions, the research aspires to address the pressing societal implications of labor market segmentation and youth employment precariousness."

The results indicate that corporate entrepreneurship positively influences the enhancement of affective organizational commitment, with learning goal orientation playing a partial mediating role. Additionally, gender serves as a significant moderating variable in the relationship between corporate entrepreneurship and affective organizational commitment, with the effect being more pronounced among male employees. Specifically, when males exhibit higher levels of corporate entrepreneurship, their affective organizational commitment tends to increase more significantly. These findings suggest that organizational practitioners should consider gender differences when designing programs to foster corporate entrepreneurship and emphasize the importance of creating an inclusive organizational environment where both men and women can actively engage in entrepreneurial behaviors. This could be a key strategy for enhancing organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Furthermore, the study highlights that reinforcing learning goal orientation can improve employee engagement and performance, providing policymakers with a foundation to develop supportive policies accordingly."

A Study on Predicting Joint Quality Using Self Piercing Riveting Process Signals,2024,"['Self piercing riveting', 'Aluminum vibration damping sheet', 'CFRP', 'Force-displacement curve', 'Machine learning', 'Quality prediction']",,"This study investigates the prediction of joint quality in self-piercing riveting (SPR) using process signals. As the use of lightweight materials such as aluminum and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) increases in the automotive industry, ensuring joint integrity has become critical. Two material combinations were analyzed: CFRP with aluminum vibration damping sheets and galvanized steel (SGACEN) with aluminum vibration damping sheets. Force and Displacement signals were monitored during the SPR process, and their correlation with maximum tensile load was evaluated. The results showed that brittle fracture, occurring vertically during the piercing of CFRP, had a significant impact on joint strength, while the gap between the rivet head and the sheet played a crucial role in determining joint strength in SGACEN-based joints. Various regression models were developed to predict joint quality, and machine learning models such as Randomforest and XGBoost were found to be more suitable than linear regression for use in different material combinations. Both the XGBoost and Randomforest models demonstrated similar accuracy in predicting joint performance, proving their reliability as real-time monitoring solutions for SPR joints."

In Korean literature, the Chinese character, Seoyu, has been used to imply sightseeing to Gaegyeong area since it means “going sightseeing to areas in the west.” However, through examination of the Seoyuilgi, this study suggests that the records imply going sightseeing in Gumi, Gimcheon, and Geochang in the Yeongnam region. There are two pieces of work with the same title, Seoyuilgi, and they were written by Hong Jae-gwan in 1904, and Mr. Shin of Pyeongsan in 1930, respectively. These two pieces a re the sa me in tha t sightseeing in mountains and rivers happened on an extension of academic learning in the Confucian standpoint, but they exhibit respective characteristics in description patterns.Seoyuilgi, written by Hong Jae-gwan, has two major patterns, and they depict landscapes through sightseeing and unfolding discussions about academic learning through social interactions with his masters and contemporary literary figures. He realizes the exquisite principle of “Hahaksangdal” after having first-hand experiences on his way to Dajeon to meet Gwak Myeon-woo. He also talks about reading methods and how to get along in the current world. The emotions that he experienced and felt on this trip reinforce his discussions further, highlighting the distinct characteristics of his work. Moreover, his work offers a peek at an aspect of his social relationships with his contemporary literary figures and the academic genealogy of Confucian scholars in Yeongnam, thus holding its significance.In his Seoyuilgi, Mr. Shin of Pyeongsan closely examines the beautiful sceneries of each tourist destination without omitting anything that his eyes capture and offers realistic descriptions about them with vitality. Instead of ending his experiences merely as sightseeing, he poetically expresses what he feels is right at that time and place ; thus, he increases the level of completion for his work. The ma in goa l of his trip is to visit scenic spots, but he a lso visits relics of previous Confucian scholars related to his ancestors. There he feels their traces and follows their taste for the arts, expressing his joy. In this process, he would get drunk heavily sometimes and write and recite poems about the emotions of sightseeing, immersing himself fully in excitement. This shows an important meaning of sightseeing in mountains and rivers."
Predicting of load capacity of concrete columns confined with FRP bars and subjected to axial compression at different eccentricity levels,2024,"['axial capacity', 'FRP bars', 'regression analysis', 'RC columns', 'XGBoost algorithm']",,"In this study, two new models were developed to predict the peak axial capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) compressive members having fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars at different eccentricity levels (e/h = 0 and e/h ranges from 0.08 to 1) using two distinct methods: the general regression method and the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. These models were developed based on a wide range dataset comprising tests data of 308 FRP-reinforced concrete samples compiled from the existing literature. Besides, the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed models were assessed using five statistical indicators namely, coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), average absolute error (AAE), standard deviation (SD), and were equated with design codes and previously proposed formulas in the literature. The findings demonstrate that the suggested estimation models were suitable for capturing the axial capacity of FRP-RC compressive members. Particularly, the XGBoost model exhibited outstanding performance with a high R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.98 and minimal RMSE, MAE, AAE and SD values of 259.05 kN, 144.36 kN, 0.11, and 0.14 respectively, indicating excellent efficiency and accuracy compared to both the empirical model proposed and other existing models. This outcome highlights the ability of machine learning models to estimate the axial capacity of FRP-RC compressive members. Consequently, the XGBoost model offers a viable alternative method to empirical models for design applications."

Algorithms based on machine learning (ML) models learn complex structural behavior patterns from real-time data collected from sensors, which can provide basic information for evaluating the safety of structures. In this study, a technique for estimating member forces acting on members using strain measurements of a double-spiral fiber sensor system embedded in a carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tube using a fully connected neural network (FCNN) model was developed, and a method for applying this to major members such as offshore wind power support structures, foundation steel pipe piles, and steel pipe members of steel structural systems was proposed. A nonlinear 3D finite element program was used to create a numerical model in which a steel pipe and a CFRP double-spiral sensor system were combined, and the data obtained from the finite element analysis were input into the FCNN model to establish a nonlinear mapping relationship between the input (strain) and the output (member force). The performance of the model was verified through various evaluation indices such as R², MSE, and MAE, and it was confirmed that the proposed AI model showed excellent performance in data suitability and computational efficiency. This study presented an efficient and reliable technical solution for estimating member forces through the behavior of steel pipes using an AI method based on analysis data, and showed the possibility of expanding and applying AI to the structural design and maintenance fields by providing more intelligent tools and methods for SHM such as offshore wind power support structures."

That is, from 2022 all of its textbooks of social studies are asserting that Dokdo belongs to Japan and that Korea is illegally occupying it — it is an obviously distorting education toward the students, the future generation for Japan. For its successful countering, the present study aimed at understanding current Korean Dokdo-education’s limitations and at drawing out comprehensive suggestions, through cross comparison of 2022 Revised Curriculum System with that of 2015 across different school levels. And findings were as follows.While 2015’s curriculum was described by six steps covering from chapter overviews, evaluation to notes. Meanwhile, however, 2022's one was described only by three steps — achievement standards, its description and considerations —, by which the frequency and quantity of citation on Dokdo education were substantially decreased in 2022 version. Also, several subjects having emphasized Dokdo in 2015 curriculum disappeared in 2022 version, by which Dokdo-education became more superficial in 2022 curriculum.In this study, as such, I drew out limitation on Dokdo education from two curriculum cycles, and suggested the following alternatives. First, the chapters on Dokdo contents should be reorganized in elementary school’s social studies curriculum. Meanwhile, in the subject of geography and history in middle school curriculum, there is need of enforcing contents about Dokdo. In high school curriculum, the historical contents on Dokdo should be reinforced in Korean history subject, while more geographic perspective on it should be further emphasized in the subject of integrated social studies; as such, both general and specialized school's students would be able to fully learn about Dokdo in both historical and geographical perspective.To add, to make Dokdo education successfully settle in schools, the organized learning system about Dokdo should be included in prospective curriculums. To add, the Dokdo education should be switched from elective to mandatory subject to be learnt in the given curriculum. Lastly, since teachers' viewpoint meaningfully affects students' thought, Dokdo training course for teachers should be set as legally mandatory program."

Additionally, it seeks to provide insights for improving these courses. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 early childhood educators, yielding the following results: First, the teachers who participated in the study reported that they had rarely taken specialized courses focused on guiding young children's problem behaviors during their university studies. Instead, they encountered content related to problem behaviors in courses such as child development or guidance for young children. The instruction on child problem behaviors was primarily delivered through actual case studies or video-based materials. Second, in terms of improving courses related to child problem behavior in early childhood teacher education, participants emphasized the need for: (1) enhanced theoretical education on child development, (2) practice-oriented training that bridges theory with real-world classroom experience, and (3) curriculum that strengthens communication skills with parents. The findings of this study highlight the importance of expanding and reinforcing coursework on child problem behavior guidance within early childhood teacher education programs. This would better equip future educators with the skills and knowledge needed to effectively address and guide children displaying problem behaviors."

Moreover, Dasan believed that Zhuxi philosophy had not yet overcome the shortcomings of Buddhism. Thus, he sought to solve this problem from two directions. One is to reorient the ethics of Confucianism toward the relationship with the external world, and the other is to establish Heavenly learning(天學) which focused on Shangdi(上帝). The key concepts that relate to both is sincerity(誠) and reverence(敬). In Dasan's view, the origin of ethics should be human religious attitudes, not cosmological principles. And so, Dasan believed that serving human beings with the attitude of sincerity and reverence is the highest form of humanity. In other words, we are supposed to cultivate oneself and treat others with the attitude of serving Heaven. Here we can see the characteristics of Dasan philosophy, which aims to “sanctify the everyday” rather than “rationalize the everyday”. This tendency is reinforced in Donghak, which emerged shortly after Dasan’s death. Both Dasan and Donghak could be called “Cheonhak(天學)” rather than “Lihak(理學)” or “Kihak(氣學)”, in that they place an attitude of sincerity and reverence for the Heaven as the foundation of human ethics."
Adaptive Intelligent Sensing Control Method for Traffic Lights under Real-Time Vehicle Conditions Based on Logic Rules,2024,"['Adaptive', 'intelligent sensing', 'rule-based reasoning', 'real-time control', 'IIoT (industrial internet of things)']",,"Compared with traditional adaptive algorithms, the complex and changing operating environment of intelligent networks demands high real-time accuracy in data transmission, necessitating an accurate and adaptive traffic light control strategy. Machine learning (ML) techniques can predict traffic conditions based on historical data and real-time information. However, some scholars have mentioned that ML techniques are still deficient in real-time response and in coping with random traffic accidents. Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) requires repeated trial and error operations. Applying traditional RL techniques to the optimal control of traffic lights may lead to more serious traffic congestion in some cases. Therefore, this paper combines perceptual control with real-time adaptive control methods to provide a rule-based reasoning method for adaptive intelligent perception and precise control of traffic signals under real-time smart grid-connected hybrid vehicle conditions. IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) devices are utilized to monitor the parking queue length, pedestrian flow, vehicle flow, and traffic flow in each lane in real time to dynamically adjust the green light duration. By adjusting the light priority according to real-time vehicle and road conditions, this method solves the problem of wasting green lights when random accidents occur in a certain lane, optimizes traffic light settings, achieves real-time precise control of lane flow, and improves the adaptability and precision of traffic lights."

Dynamic SFC placement with parallelized VNFs in Data Center Networks: A DRL-based approach,2024,['Data Center NetworkService Function ChainPlacementVirtual Network FunctionsParallelized VNFs'],,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology can tie together a set of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) as a Service Function Chain (SFC). Although NFV is a promising technology for the placement of user service requests, SFCs often suffer from high delay and low throughput. This paper develops an efficient approach based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with the aim of deploying VNFs with low delay during heterogeneous bandwidth demands in Data Center Networks (DCNs). We design an architecture that exploits the dependencies of VNFs to parallelize them and also preserve more resources for processing future requests by extracting the distribution of initialized VNFs. Our algorithm is expected to maximize the long-term reward and improve the computational acceleration in provisioning user service requests. Our evaluations show that the proposed algorithm reduces the service delay by 12% through parallelized VNFs."

In order to improve the robustness of the system, the zero-sum game problem of control input and disturbance for strict feedback systems is studied in this paper. Specifically, reinforcement learning (RL) is used to obtain the Nash equilibrium solution of the subsystem corresponding to the virtual control input and the virtual disturbance based on the HJB equation. By using the recursive process of backstepping, the controller of the tracking game problem between the control input and the disturbance of the high-order system is designed. In addition, according to the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that all internal signals of the closed-loop systems are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed method."

Towards Regionally Customized English AI Digital Textbooks,2024,"['English textbooks', 'AI digital textbook (AIDT)', 'large culture', 'small culture', 'region']",,"Korean elementary schools have relied on standardized, paper-based English textbooks. This pilot study examines how these textbooks represent regions such as Jeju and Busan, aiming to inform the development of the Artificial Intelligence Digital Textbook (AIDT), set to launch in 2025. Drawing on Holliday’s (1999) cultural paradigm, this study utilizes both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The analyses focus on textbooks from two publishers widely used on Jeju Island. The findings reveal a lack of regional references in textbooks for lower grades. Specific regions are mentioned in textbooks for higher grades, but primarily as weekend or summer travel destinations. Seoul is presented as the main character’s place of origin, implicitly positioning it as the central place of residence. Jeju, which appears frequently, is consistently depicted as a tourist destination, reinforcing an oversimplified and peripheral image of the region.

Peer feedback reinforces self-objectification in the process of reviewing others’ writings. Instructors can use self-feedback and peer feedback to improve learners’ writing efficacy and encourage their participation in subsequent classes. Ultimately, a multilayered cascade of feedback that combines peer and instructor feedback with self-feedback is meaningful in that it creates conditions in which learners lead metacognition.Despite some limitations, we expect that the discussion in this paper will be shared as an example of a teaching-learning method in educational settings that recognizes the close relationship between college writing and metacognition."
Enhancing VANET Security: Efficient Communication and Wormhole Attack Detection using VDTN Protocol and TD3 Algorithm,2024,"['VANET Security', 'Communication', 'Worm Hole Attack', 'VDTN', 'TD3']",,"Due to the rapid evolution of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), effective communication and security are now essential components in providing secure and reliable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. However, due to their dynamic nature and potential threats, VANETs need to have strong security mechanisms. This paper presents a novel approach to improve VANET security by combining the Vehicular Delay-Tolerant Network (VDTN) protocol with the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) technique known as the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. A store-carry-forward method is used by the VDTN protocol to resolve the problems caused by inconsistent connectivity and disturbances in VANETs. The TD3 algorithm is employed for capturing and detecting Worm Hole Attack (WHA) behaviors in VANETs, thereby enhancing security measures. By combining these components, it is possible to create trustworthy and effective communication channels as well as successfully detect and stop rushing attacks inside the VANET. Extensive evaluations and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, enhancing both security and communication efficiency."

Transformer-Based Mechanical Property Prediction for Polymer Matrix Composites,2024,['Artifi cial intelligence · Mechanical property prediction · Polymer matrix composites · Language model'],,"Combinatorial nature of polymer matrix composites design requires a robust predictive model to accurately predict the mechanical properties of polymer composites, thereby reducing the need for extensive and costly trial-and-error approaches in their manufacturing. However, traditional prediction models have been either lacking in accuracy or too resource-intensive for practical use. This study proposes an advanced Transformer-based predictive model simultaneously considering various variables that can infl uence mechanical properties, while utilizing only a minimal amount of training data. In developing this model, we utilize an extensive dataset across 294 types of polymer composites, using a diverse range of polymers and reinforcements, providing a comprehensive basis for the model’s predictions. The model employs a Transformer-based transfer learning technique, known for its effi ciency with small datasets, to predict essential mechanical properties such as tensile strength, tensile modulus, fl exural strength, fl exural modulus and density. It shows high predictive accuracy ( R 2 = 92%) and makes reliable predictions for combinations of polymer composites that have not been trained on ( R 2 = 82%).

Predictive policing technologies have revolutionized public safety and crime prevention by enabling advanced data analysis and algorithmic decision-making. However, they also pose significant challenges to constitutional values and fundamental rights. This paper focuses on the potential erosion of key constitutional principles, including the presumption of innocence, due process, and the principle of accountability, in the context of machine learning and data-driven decision-making. It highlights the dual potential of predictive policing technologies to be extensively applied across various stages of criminal justice—from crime prediction during police operations to investigations, bail, sentencing, and corrections—while risking infringements on individual freedoms, privacy, and reinforcing systemic biases.To address these issues, the paper underscores the necessity of clear legal frameworks regulating predictive policing technologies and proposes legislative directions that establish explicit boundaries between permissible and prohibited uses. Key recommendations include the development of criteria that differentiate acceptable and restricted uses based on technology purpose and operational environment, strengthening oversight mechanisms for high-risk AI systems, and implementing mandatory measures such as robust data governance, risk management protocols, and operational logging. Furthermore, recognizing the cross-border nature of AI technology, the paper emphasizes the importance of international cooperation to achieve regulatory interoperability and prevent legal conflicts and regulatory arbitrage resulting from divergent national regulations. Strengthening institutional mechanisms to ensure redress and legal protections for individuals affected by predictive policing technologies is another critical focus, aiming to safeguard fundamental rights through post-incident remedies and recovery procedures.In conclusion, the paper argues for the establishment of a cautious and systematic regulatory framework that balances the transformative potential of predictive policing technologies with the protection of constitutional values and fundamental rights. Regulations should function not as barriers to technological innovation but as essential safeguards to prevent misuse and ensure equitable and safe deployment. Policymakers and regulatory authorities must adopt a balanced approach prioritizing long-term societal impacts over short-term efficiency, thereby creating sustainable legal and social systems to support the responsible use of predictive policing technologies."

Analysis of Grounded System Theory to Dilemmas of Artificial Intelligence,2024,"['근거시스템이론', '딜레마', '편견', '인공지능', 'ChatGPT', 'Grounded System theory', 'dilemma', 'bias', 'artificial intelligence', 'ChatGPT']",,"This paper aims to uncover hidden feedback loops in the dilemmas of artificial intelligence. Applying the grounded system theory method to interviews with ChatGPT, this paper performed open and axial coding, and conducted analysis using loop coding instead of selective coding as in traditional grounded theory. Through this analysis, a circular paradigm model of “dilemmas of artificial intelligence” is constructed. Overall, it is confirmed that artificial intelligence sufficiently understands dilemma situations. Additionally, it is pointed out that there is a vicious cycle where “bias” is reinforced through the “learning” of artificial intelligence. Furthermore, AI is concerned about a loop where decision delays under a dilemma exacerbate the dilemma.

This study proposes that the circular paradigm model constructed through the procedures of grounded system theory can help uncover hidden feedback structures in interview texts."
Why Does Socialization Matter? : Analyzing the Impact of Socialization and Risk Perception on Energy Saving Behavior,2024,"['energy saving behavior', 'socialization', 'risk perception']",,"The purpose of this study is to analyze the determinants of energy saving behavior. This study aims to analyse the factors that influence energy saving behavior with a focus on socialization factors. Social factors are fundamental determinants of energy behavior, but there has been a lack of systematic research on them. According to the results of the survey data, first, the influence of socialization factors is in the order of peer group > parent > experience.In order to strengthen learning in energy conservation in social relationships, it is necessary to use educational communities in the community where peers can exchange experiences. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen parental education to reinforce education at home and to expand the number of experience facilities where people can experience energy conservation. Second, in the risk perception paradigm, perceived benefits > subjective knowledge > trust > perceived risk affect energy conservation in the order of perceived benefits > subjective knowledge > trust > perceived risk. Although these variables have a great influence on energy conservation, these factors are closely related to socialization factors, so strategies to improve perceived risk, benefits, knowledge, and trust using socialization factors are necessary."

In recent years, data mining technology has received extensive attention. It is a technology that converts a large amount of data into useful information and finds the relationship between data and information. The classification algorithm is one of the important research contents in data mining. It mainly divides the data items in the dataset into a fixed category according to various classifiers. From the perspective of the development trend of the world economy, technological progress, consumption upgrading and institutional change are mutually reinforcing and integrating. In financial technology, the evolution of technology is reshaping the financial industry. Data intelligence technology based on machine learning and other algorithms is changing rapidly. Data is the largest means of production, the most important factor of production of artificial intelligence (AI), and the core factor of production. Big data, cloud computing, AI and other emerging technologies build different data structures for processing through deep learning and other learning algorithms to achieve accurate analysis, rapid decision-making and other characteristics. At the same time, it also provides financial institutions with more accurate and comprehensive data services. It has established long-term cooperation with financial institutions, promoting the accelerated integration of finance and technology and jointly creating a more intelligent financial system. Bayesian algorithm is a classical algorithm in classification algorithms. It is a possibility reasoning method based on probability statistics. Bayesian algorithm calculates a posteriori probability through a priori probability. Because of its small error rate, it has been widely used in various fields. This paper will analyze banking financial technology and AI economy based on cyber-physical systems and Bayesian algorithms. The research results showed that Bank A added 1,275 small customers in the first quarter of 2020, accounting for 69.52% in 2019; in the first quarter of 2020, inclusive microfinance increased by 4.7 billion yuan, with a year-on-year growth of 35.34%, indicating that Bank A played an irreplaceable role in using financial technology in times of crisis. It points out a new development direction for the application of cyber-physical systems."
A Comprehensive Survey on Multiple-Runway Aircraft Landing Optimization Problem,2024,"['aircraft scheduling', 'runway', 'multi-objective problems', 'optimization problems.']",,"The significant increase in civil aircraft traffic has led to frequent congestion and various negative outcomes within the terminal area. To mitigate these challenges, addressing and studying the aircraft landing problem (ALP) well are essential. This problem involves arranging the sequence of aircraft on airport runways and scheduling their operations while accounting for multiple operational constraints. Air traffic control is known as an optimization and ongoing problem with multi-objective challenges. In this survey paper, we propose a comprehensive review of the latest studies on the ALP in which we cover a wide variety of methodologies, including mixed-integer programming, dynamic programming, heuristics, meta-heuristics, and reinforcement learning techniques. This survey also proposes a classification of the ALP and summarizes all the identified constraints, objectives, frequency of their occurrence, and datasets used by these studies consisting of one or multiple runways. In addition, based on the existing literature, we discuss the advantages, such as delay and pollution minimization, and disadvantages, such as problem size unscalability and limiting the problem to single-runway mode."

Then it critically examines the truth of the somewhat exaggerated Jesuit transfer of Western science through the the case analysis of Hungai tongxian tushuo (Illustrated Explanation of the Sphere and the Astrolabe, 1607). To this end, this study directly quotes and translates some of the original texts of Western and Chinese sources that have only been briefly introduced in previous studies.The Hungai is the Chinese version of Clavius’ Astrolabium (1593) translated first by Matteo Ricci and written separately in literary Chinese by Li Zhizao. This book was written by Li who had never learned any Western language, without a thorough understanding of the original text and without a complete translation, but merely using the concepts and terminology of traditional Chinese astronomy. Li recognized that China was no longer the geographical center of the world on the spherical earth. However, most Chinese intellectuals, familiar with the traditional cosmology of a round sky and a square earth, resisted the idea of a spherical earth for a long time. In explaining the stereographic projection of astrolabe in the Hungai, Li Zhizao unintentionally provided an argument that reinforced the ideological Sinocentrism of Qing intellectuals by interpreting the ancient forgotten theory of Gaitian (canopy heaven) as being integrated with the theory of Huntain (spherical heaven)."
위대한 중화의 재림 — 중국 고고박물관의 공간 의미와 역사 기억,2024,"['Chinese archaeological museum', 'Collective identity', 'Chinese history', 'Digital technology', 'Propaganda', 'Chinese civilization', 'Unity', 'Ideology', 'Continuity', 'Spatial significance', 'Historical memory']",,"This study primarily examines how Chinese archaeological museum represents China from historical and cultural perspectives, focusing on two main aspects: the “spatial significance” and “historical memory” of this museum.In the section on “order and power,” it is revealed that the space of archaeological museum symbolically reflects China’s centralized power structure. The exhibition emphasizes China’s historical continuity and promote China’s political orientation. As a space of “ritual and sanctity,” the archaeological museum also plays a role in elevating collective identity and national pride among Chinese people. Additionally, it provides visitors with an experience that goes beyond simply learning about Chinese history, offering a sort of sacred experience. However, this process of sanctification not only provides a rite of passage that strengthens collective identity among Chinese visitors but also can make foreign visitors feel alienated as outsiders.As “a space for education and learning,” the archaeological museum effectively educates visitors about China’s history and culture by utilizing the latest digital technology. Through AI technology and digital exhibits, visitors are able to view ancient artifacts from various angles, thereby deepening their understanding of the historical context. These exhibition techniques enhance visitor immersion and effectively convey China’s historical legitimacy and ideology.Next, this study examines the “historical memory” of archaeological museum. The museum reconstructs “historical memory” around three themes: “Great unity of a nation[大國一統],” “Harmonious integration of all people[和融萬方],” and “National awakening[民族覺醒],” thus reinforcing the collective identity of the Chinese nation and legitimizing the governing ideology of modern China.By examining archaeological museum through the two frameworks of “spatial significance” and “historical memory,” this study confirms that this museum emphasizes the political orientation of modern China, reconstructs China’s historical identity, and plays a propagandistic role in educating the public about the continuity and superiority of Chinese civilization."

Interview transcripts and additional written materials were collected to conduct qualitative research using a grounded theory approach. As a result, we identified 164 concepts, 34 subcategories, and 11 overarching categories in the open coding phase. The causal conditions influencing the central phenomenon of ‘Development of AI-Based Teacher Supporting Platforms’ were digital transformation, diversification of AI, and EdTech. Contextual conditions that reinforced this central phenomenon included the pursuit of personalized learning, collaboration, communication, networking, administrative support, and demand for workload reduction. Mediating conditions included teachers' acceptance of technology, platform functionality issues, differences in learner characteristics, ethical issues, and concerns. Consequently, strategies pursuit of platform stability and sophistication, training and technical support were derived as operative-interaction strategies. The implementation of these strategies would manifest in paradigm shifts in teaching direction quality, assessment methods, teacher roles, and changes in teacher-student relationships. Finally, the core category resulting from selective coding emphasized the necessity for AI teacher supporting platforms to be explainable by teachers, be exchangeable to suit environments and functions, and facilitate a shift towards personalized education methods and quality improvement."

The primary objective is to analyze the impact of plasma actuators on flow separation and wake region characteristics, which are critical for reducing drag and suppressing vortex-induced vibrations. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) was employed to explore the flow dynamics at various operational parameters, including different actuation frequencies and voltages. The proposed methodology employs a neural network trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to determine optimal control policies for plasma actuators. This network is integrated with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver for real-time control. Results indicate that this deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy outperforms existing methods in controlling flow, demonstrating robustness and adaptability across various flow conditions, which highlights its potential for practical applications."
Computation Offloading with Resource Allocation Based on DDPG in MEC,2024,"['Computation Offloading', 'DDPG', 'MEC', 'Resource Allocation']",,"Recently, multi-access edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technology to alleviate the computing burden of vehicular terminals and efficiently facilitate vehicular applications. The vehicle can improve the quality of experience of applications by offloading their tasks to MEC servers. However, channel conditions are time-varying due to channel interference among vehicles, and path loss is time-varying due to the mobility of vehicles. The task arrival of vehicles is also stochastic. Therefore, it is difficult to determine an optimal offloading with resource allocation decision in the dynamic MEC system because offloading is affected by wireless data transmission. In this paper, we study computation offloading with resource allocation in the dynamic MEC system. The objective is to minimize power consumption and maximize throughput while meeting the delay constraints of tasks. Therefore, it allocates resources for local execution and transmission power for offloading. We define the problem as a Markov decision process, and propose an offloading method using deep reinforcement learning named deep deterministic policy gradient. Simulation shows that, compared with existing methods, the proposed method outperforms in terms of throughput and satisfaction of delay constraints."

CNN은 딥러닝 분야에서 이미지 분류 및 데이터 학습에 유용한 장점을 가지고 있다. 이 기법을 활용하여 UV LAMP로 특정 시간 동안 HDPE를 자외선에 노출시킨후, 부식된 이미지 데이터를 취득하고 훈련을 진행하였고 90% 이상의 정확도를 도출하였다. 연구 결과를 기반으로 선박 소재의 노후화를 예측하고, 이에 따른 폐선 처리 문제와 해상 환경오염을 사전에 방지할 수 있는 효과적인 방안을 모색할 수 있을 것으로 기대된다.","Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) materials, which are mainly used in ship manufacturing, provide excellent durability and impact resistance, but long-term exposure to ultraviolet rays causes serious deformation, which complicates the processing of closed wires and is pointed out as one of the main causes of marine environmental pollution. As a countermeasure against this, the use of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which is attracting attention as an eco-friendly and recyclable material, is increasing, but HDPE is also showing vulnerability to ultraviolet rays due to the limitations of heat resistance and weather resistance. In this paper, we apply the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an artificial intelligence technique, to analyze and predict HDPE corroded by exposure to ultraviolet rays over time. CNN has useful advantages for image classification and data learning in the field of deep learning, and through this technique, it was confirmed that after exposing HDPE to ultraviolet rays for a specific time using UV LAMP, it can be predicted with more than 90% accuracy by acquiring it with corroded image data and conducting training. Based on the research results, it is expected that it will be possible to predict the aging of ship materials and find effective ways to prevent the disposal of abandoned ships and marine environmental pollution in advance."
Fusion of Digital Twin and Blockchain for Secure and Efficient IoV Networks,2024,"['IoV', 'Digital Twin', 'Blockchain', 'Security', 'Efficiency', 'Complexity']",,"The emergence of digital twin technology has spurred numerous endeavors to construct smart cities while simultaneously driving the development of smart cars that boast enhanced driver safety and convenience by integrating advanced information technology into automotive systems. This study delves into the challenges encountered within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) when employing edge computing, including computation complexity, communication latency, and security issues. IoV systems leveraging edge computing often grapple with deficiencies in quality of service and quality of experience due to resource constraints, while offloading services to the cloud exacerbates latency and often leads to bandwidth constraints during data transmission. Moreover, a notable concern arises from edge computing devices' substantially lower physical security level than their counterparts at core cloud sites. Given these challenges, this study explores utilizing blockchain and digital twin technologies as potential solutions. We first analyze recent research to address these issues. We propose an optimized offloading decision-making framework that combines value function approximation utilizing digital twin-based deep learning and reinforcement learning methodologies. Subsequently, to mitigate security vulnerabilities, we delve into the deployment of blockchain technology.

The reality is that writing through ChatGTP is quite common in all areas of literature. Oh Jang-hwan, who started his career during the colony of Japanese Imperialism era in the 1930s, was a poet who revolutionized the city center in the form of prose poetry. While artificial intelligence in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution was a revolution in the future society, Oh Jang-hwan's prose poetry was a revolution in a closed society during the Japanese colonial era. Oh Jang-hwan's poetic world was the face of the real world through prose poetry. It recognizes reality through criticism, self-denial, and self-criticism from tradition and decadent civilized society. The reality faced by poet Oh Jang-hwan reinforces his poetic imagery through constant participation in reality. In the 4th Industrial Revolution, artificial intelligence becomes the subject of creation and becomes a model in all areas of literature. This is an innovation and revolution of the future society. If the high-level emotions that only humans feel are utilized by using artificial neural networks in deep learning, the reading of emotions that people want to express will be more concrete. In each era, it has come so far through a revolution led by the times. This is seen as the result of a sense of criticism that reflects reality. In this sense, it can be said that poet Oh Jang-hwan has secured poetic reality more than any other poet of the time by showing vitality for the future rather than being complacent with reality."

While previous 4·3 commemorative events held in Jeju have generally focused on bringing the silenced past into the present and uttering about it, the 76th 4·3 Eve’s commemoration ceremony introduced the notion of diaspora into the title, defining itself as a project of spatial expansion of discussion on the historical event. Jeju Islander victims and their relatives, stowaways, those who moved to Japan after the 4·3 tragedy, and mainlanders who have suffered and/or learnt about similar social traumas respectively present their artistic creations on the ceremonial stage. Through the performance event, a new form of collective identity emerges as a (not-yet unified) form of “diaspora” - people who are connected together to the history of forced dispersion due to social disasters. Multiple actors, including directors, composers and performers who have developed their own artistic languages for identity-articulation, have different views on various aesthetic and musical registers (such as genre registers including folk, popular, and traditional music) and semiotically-attached cultural and aesthetic meanings to them, and reflect their differentiated views in their artworks. These differences together contribute to the articulation of 4·3 diaspora in a specific way. While academic discussions on diasporic art have been mainly concerned with the construction or reinforcement of the identity of diasporic groups residing “outside the motherland” (from the perspective of nation-state), this performative event case provides an ethnographic example of conceptual articulation of diaspora through performances designed by summoning diaspora artists and their texts onto the commemorative stage of “diasporic homeland.”"

Jeongjo emphasized a harmonious integration of the Four Books and the Six Classics through the lens of Neo-Confucianism, particularly the teachings of Zhu Xi. By positioning the Great Learning (Daxue) as a central text, King Jeongjo sought to reform the literary culture and reinforce state governance in late Joseon dynasty. While he adhered to Zhu Xi’s interpretative framework, King Jeongjo demonstrated flexibility in addressing the contemporary academic and social challenges. This paper examines King Jeongjo’s focus on the Six Classics, exploring how his literary ideas transcended mere academic discourses to serve as a practical tool for reinforcing state disciplines and social edification. Through this analysis, the study sheds light on how King Jeongjo’s integrated approach to the Confucian canons influenced the political and cultural developments of the late Joseon period and reevaluates the academic significance of his literary theory."

문법 교육에서 ‘언어 주체의 태도 표현’에 관한 연구 - 상위 담화(metadiscourse markers)의 대인적(interpersonal) 기능을 중심으로 -,2024,"['문법 교육', '상위 담화', '태도 표현', '평가 이론', '대인적 기능', 'grammar education', 'metadiscourse markers', 'attitude expression', 'appraisal theory', 'interpersonal metafunction']",,"This study examines the direction of teaching attitude expressions of language subjects based on the perspective of viewing grammatical elements and vocabulary as 'metadiscourse markers.' To this end, it was confirmed that 'attitude' has been used as one of the categories constituting the curriculum framework in the Korean language curriculum over the years, and it was revealed that the 'attitude of the language subject' is described in the curriculum content in a sense similar to 'expression intention.' In fact, the attitude of the language subject can be expressed through all language units, but the emphasis on grammatical elements and vocabulary as curriculum content lies in the fact that they are 'meaning resources' that can be 'chosen.' However, it was found that in the process of implementing these achievement standards into textbooks, the educational content of grammatical elements and vocabulary as 'meaning resources' disappears, and education is still conducted in a fragmented manner by grammatical categories and language units. Therefore, this study reviewed previous discussions on 'metadiscourse' to reinforce the concept that it is a 'linguistic resource mobilized by the author considering the reader and context,' and emphasized that the education of attitude expression of language subjects needs to focus on the interpersonal characteristics inherent in 'metadiscourse markers.' The mechanism of choosing metadiscourse markers can be structured by partially adopting the appraisal system centered on the relationship between the language subject and the reader/listener.By designing the education of attitude expression of language subjects based on the concept of metadiscourse, it is possible to integratively encompass existing educational content on grammatical categories such as honorific expressions, quotation expressions, and passive expressions, as well as the intentions behind vocabulary choices, while exploring the meta-functional meanings of grammatical elements and vocabulary at the text level. However, to ensure that this perspective does not remain merely declarative, it is suggested that 1) grammatical elements and vocabulary education be reorganized considering the selection mechanism of metadiscourse markers, and 2) an approach considering the genre of the text is necessary. Specific learning activities were exemplified to illustrate this approach."

It first discusses the detailed workings of natural language processing, where embedding serves as the initial step in computer-based language processing. The relationship between transformers and GPT is explained for sentence-level embedding. Then this paper explores the development of Chat GPT based on GPT-3.5, which has been improved via reinforcement learning from human feedback or RLHF, and released by OpenAI. Chat GPT can be utilized in various domains such as question answering, translation, correction, summarization, tabular data processing, and coding. It can guide users to obtain desired responses through role-setting and data delivery. However, its broad application is having significant societal impacts. Issues related to corporate or national security have led to usage restrictions, while debates over authorship recognition in the scientific community and discussions about artistic value in the cultural and arts sector have sparked strikes due to job concerns. The emergence of fake problems produced by generative AI, along with its misuse for cybercrime, is also highlighted. Such limitations of Chat GPT, including hallucination phenomena, are discussed in this work. Lastly, suggestions are made for utilizing Chat GPT in business that include emphasizing the need for content verification with hallucination in mind, cautioning against relying solely on search engines, utilizing generative AI with retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) functionality, and employing small large language models (sLLMs) developed for professional domains."

Accordingly, the direction of urban regeneration projects must also seek ways to change according to changes in the social structure. This is a matter of justification for applying changes in economic activities and consumption patterns according to population changes and environment in the country and region. Measures to strengthen urban and regional competitiveness should promote regional revitalization through restoration of spatial characteristics. The new measures must meet the basic meaning and purpose of urban regeneration for regional reinvention and revitalization. Social values continue to be discussed on various concepts of openness and democracy, social quality, equity, and sustainability. Looking at the bills related to social values, the Social Value Act (draft) is still pending in the National Assembly. However, the ESG 4 Act, the Public Institution Operation Act, the National Finance Act, the National Pension Act, and the Procurement Business Act, are all in effect as of January 2024. The common social items of the 'ESG 4 Act' are the pursuit of equality and diversity. The characteristics of social values are summarized as publicity, liquidity, consultation, and diversity. Discussion of the concept of social value in Korea began with the promise of state administration when the Moon Jae In government was inaugurated, focusing on 'improving the quality of life of the people'. Currently, various methods of measuring social values are being discussed, but problems of standardization, and flexibility requirements for measuring social values are exposed. Therefore, the development of a new value measurement methodology through artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning is being prepared. In urban regeneration, social value practice is practiced through social inclusion and urban regeneration projects applying social values. In urban regeneration, the subjects of social value practice are local people, who are social capital, and the stakeholders of the target site. The practice of social value is expressed by the participation of the social capital, which is the resident of the target site. For social capital, the scale of the network and the measure of trust are important. In Korea, it is proposed to newly discuss ways to practice social values using collective impact. Collective impact is a method of solving common problems through joint goal building, collaboration, and solidarity. This will be an alternative methodology for realizing social value practice in urban regeneration based on a shared system, reinforced complementary activities, and continuous communication."

The traditional method of military spirit education, a practice with a 75-year history, has evolved from conventional in-person, lecture-based formats to the utilization of video tape recordings (VTR) to enhance educational outcomes. Since 2009, this evolution has further progressed to include education facilitated through defense-oriented television broadcasting. Presently, the Ministry of National Defense and Army Headquarters are at the forefront of adopting virtual reality (VR) technology, with the introduction of realistic digital content and devices in a pilot capacity to certain military units.The primary goal of this research is to address and surmount the prevailing constraints of existing mental power education methodologies, including those that incorporate scientific and technological advancements, with a focus on augmenting and mobilizing the mental resilience of military personnel. To achieve this objective, the study advocates for the implementation of brain science-based educational strategies, which have already proven their efficacy in both educational and athletic settings, within the realm of military spirit training.The desired outcomes of military spirit education are to foster conviction through learning and to motivate action through belief. This involves converting acquired knowledge into long-term memory by reinforcing explicit memory through active recollection, and facilitating the expression of beliefs as actions, even subconsciously, by bolstering implicit memory.Brain science-based education employs methodologies that leverage the principle whereby memory retention is enhanced through increased electrical stimulation of neurons, and skill acquisition is facilitated through the expansion of neuron re-weighting and re-connection via continuous training. This approach aligns with the objectives of military spirit education, suggesting its potential to significantly improve the mental resilience of soldiers.Given the escalating security challenges, exemplified by North Korea’s persistent missile tests and nuclear advancements, the imperative to fortify the military spirit of military personnel is more critical than ever. It is posited that the application of brain science principles to military spirit training during such times will play a pivotal role in bolstering the mental resilience required to meet contemporary security demands.Given the escalating security challenges, exemplified by North Korea’s persistent missile tests and nuclear advancements, the imperative to fortify the military spirit of military personnel is more critical than ever.

According to the Self-Determination Theory, humans exercise voluntary behavior and intrinsic motivation when three psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relationship are satisfied (Ryan & Deci, 2000), and previous studies have shown that these psychological factors can have a significant effect on the music activities of blind learners (Borim Lee, 2015). In particular, high school blind learners are in a period where self-identity and autonomy development are important, and they should be provided with the opportunity to build confidence and grow into independent learners through musical experiences. In this study, the existing Midfriec music criticism class model was revised and supplemented so that visually impaired learners can systematically experience self-determination factors (Borim Lee, 2018), and the final model was presented by securing validity and reflecting supplementary matters through expert review. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that high school visually impaired learners can reinforce autonomy and achievement by having opportunities for autonomous judgment and musical interpretation through this class model, and can improve relationships through interactions with others in the criticism process. The revised instructional model showed the potential for visually impaired learners to form self-directed learning attitudes and strengthen self-determination attitudes even in general learning situations. This study proposed a music criticism class model suitable for visually impaired learners through literature research and expert review and confirmed its validity, suggesting that this model can contribute to strengthening the overall self-determination of visually impaired learners. As a follow-up study, it is necessary to empirically verify various groups of visually impaired learners and develop an integrated educational program including composition and performance activities in addition to music criticism. Through this, it is expected that the music criticism class model proposed by this study can effectively support the self-determination of visually impaired learners."

The human visual system compensates for the effect of illumination that changes at a constant level and recognizes the color of an object. In this study, the color component of illumination, which is an important element of color constancy, can be obtained by calculating the spectral power distribution of illumination from an input color image. Color constancy is a long-standing research topic and has been studied extensively. There are two representative methods: a method using RGB and a method using spectrum, and this study is the latter. The method recently announced by Koskinen et al. is different from the general spectrum-based method, and additionally defines a sub-band spectrum and estimates the illumination component through linear regression. This study expands the data set of the spectrum for illumination and object color proposed in Koskinen's method and improves the linear regression method. The proposed method uses actual measured spectrum data to reinforce the virtual spectrum of the conventional method, and increases the accuracy by adjusting the variables related to linear regression. For the experiment of the proposed method, 1707 color images from the cube+ data set, which is the same as the conventional method, were used as input images. For learning and testing, the input image set was divided into two subgroups, each consisting of 1207 and 500 images. The performance of the proposed method, including linear regression improvement, was verified using the angular error with respect to the ground-truth illuminant chromaticity. It was confirmed that the proposed method improved the angular error by about 17.35% compared to the conventional method."

Message interactivity is defined as the AI speaker’s ability to learn and adapt through conversations, providing personalized feedback. This capability positively influences continued usage intention by enhancing user experiences through the mediating roles of self-efficacy and multi-functionality, which contribute to reducing cognitive load during user-system interactions. Furthermore, message interactivity plays a significant role in reinforcing technology usage intention by fulfilling user expectations. Consistent with expectation-confirmation theory, meeting initial expectations leads to a positive affirmation of system performance, resulting in heightened satisfaction. This satisfaction, in turn, directly connects to users’ continued usage intention. Self-efficacy and multi-functionality also impact continued usage intention through the mediating effect of expectation fulfillment, which significantly influences continued usage intention via perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness—key antecedents outlined in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Effectively utilizing and enhancing these variables is critical for promoting the adoption and social acceptance of technology.The study holds both academic and practical significance. Academically, it systematically elucidates the process by which message interactivity affects continued usage intention through self-efficacy, multi-functionality, and expectation fulfillment, thereby contributing to the extension and deepening of existing technology acceptance models. Practically, the findings emphasize the importance of message interactivity for AI speaker developers and user experience designers. By highlighting the need to enhance users’ self-efficacy and expectation fulfillment, the study provides practical directions for designing functions and interfaces that improve user satisfaction and engagement. However, additional factors such as social influence, enjoyment, and voluntariness, which may also affect AI speaker acceptance, need to be considered. Since this research is based on survey data, it lacks experimental evidence to clearly establish causal relationships between interactive experiences and self-efficacy. Addressing these limitations through future research could deepen understanding of how external factors influence user perceptions and behaviors in AI speaker adoption. By reflecting real-world user experiences rather than controlled experimental settings, future studies can explore the relationship between interactivity and self-efficacy in practical contexts, providing more realistic insights.Despite these limitations, the study identifies the key characteristics of message interactivity and verifies the processes and factors influencing AI speaker acceptance and continued usage intention. These findings offer strategies to enhance AI speaker adoption and user experience while providing meaningful implications for the acceptance and diffusion of emerging AI-based technologies and media. Future research on AI speakers should adopt a comprehensive approach that goes beyond technical analyses, encompassing human-technology interaction, social changes, and ethical considerations. Such research can contribute to the human-centric development of technology."

It also suggests directions for educational support directions in teacher training programs. Metaphor analysis was used as the research method. Fifty-six first-year students in pursuing a four-year course at a university's Department of Child Studies were recruited. The results revealed that pre-service early childhood teachers perceived early childhood education through five main themes. First, early childhood education as a facilitator of growth and development; this was expressed through metaphors such as water, sprouts, and sunlight, indicating that early childhood education supports the physical, emotional, and cognitive development of children. Second, early childhood education as a foundation; this was represented by metaphors such as blueprints, building foundations, and stepping stones, emphasizing the critical role of early childhood education in establishing a basis for future learning and life. Third, early childhood education as a starting point; this was reflected through metaphors such as the first button, the starting line, and the beginning of a journey, symbolizing its role in providing a positive and meaningful first step in life. Fourth, early childhood education as a guide; this was expressed through metaphors such as compass, map, and milestone, highlighting the role of teachers in helping children set goals and directions for their lives. Finally, early childhood education as caregiving; this was expressed through metaphors such as being a gardener, having parental touch, and being nurturing, emphasizing the importance of providing emotional stability and warmth to children. Accordingly, this study suggests the need to strengthen integrated teacher roles in integrating early childhood education and care, provide opportunities for self-reflection through metaphors, reinforce the importance of caregiving, and utilize the intuitive perspectives of novice pre-service teachers."

Rituals, which are formal acts of praying to transcendent entities or nature for specific purposes, and folktales, which are fictional stories passed down through generations. unlike in the past, today’s rituals and stories are becoming less utilized and away from people’s interest. This research focuses on two works: Lee Cheong-Jun’s “Bihwa Milgyo” and Hyeon Gill-Eon’s “Geunmeumbamuijeui” both utilize the motifs of rituals and the folktale of the child warrior to narrate regional suffering. “Bihwa Milgyo” employs rituals and folktales as metaphors for the concepts of concealment and revelation, emphasizing the struggles related to language and writing. in contrast, “Geunmeumbamuijeui” uses the tragic reality and the yearning for a hero’s emergence as its main themes, the child warrior folktale in “Bihwa Milgyo” presents a lesson on the “tragedy of revelation” and warns against the rapid changes and the dangers similar to the child warrior’s tragedy. on the other hand, “Geunmeumbamuijeui” reinterprets the child warrior folktale from Jeju island, imbuing it with new creative elements, it contrasts the ancient figure of the child warrior with the bleak present, encouraging intellectuals to adopt a patriotic stance, thereby reinforcing their identity and self-esteem. This research aims to correctly understand the issues surrounding rituals and the value of the child  warrior folktale. It is meaningful in that it provides an opportunity to learn our traditional culture through the meaning included in it and to know new things through the old."
<Royal Match> 게임 요소의 게이머 욕구 단계 충족에 대한 연구,2024,"['게임 디자인', '게이머 심리적 욕구 단계', 'Match-3 게임', '<Royal Match>', 'game design', 'hierarchy of player psychological needs', 'Match-3 games', '<Royal Match>']","게임 <Royal Match>는 최근 몇 년 동안 큰 인기를 얻은 새로운 Match-3 작품이며, 기존 Match-3 게임을 기초로 새로운 게임 요소를 추가하였다. 그 성공의 주요 원인을 탐구하기 위해 게임 디자인 관점에서 이 게임이 게이머의 심리적 욕구를 어떻게 충족시키는지 탐구할 필요가 있다. 현재 Match-3 게임 연구가 상대적으로 적은 상황이므로, 새로운 유형의 Match-3 게임인 <Royal Match>를심층적으로 분석하는 본 연구는 충분한 연구 가치가 있다. 이는 전통적인 Match-3 게임이 간단한 게임 규칙을바탕으로 게이머의 욕구를 어떻게 충족시키는가에 대한 이해에 도움을 줄 뿐만 아니라 새로운 유형의 Match-3 게임이 어떤 요소들을 융합하여 게이머의 기대와 욕구를 어떻게 충족시키는지 탐구할 수 있다. 따라서 본 연구는 디자이너의 관점에서 게이머의 욕구 단계 이론에 따라 <Royal Match>의 특정한 게임 디자인 요소가 어떻게 게이머의 다양한 심리적 욕구에 대응하고 충족시키는지 탐구하였다. 구체적으로 게임 디자인요소의 피라미드 이론과 게이머의 욕구 단계 이론을 통해 새로운 분석 프레임을 제시하고, <Royal Match>를사례로 하여 해당 게임의 각 게임 디자인 단계가 어떻게 게이머의 기본적인 안전 욕구에서 높은 단계의 자아실현 욕구를 충족시키는지 분석하였다. 연구 결과 흔히 볼 수 있는 기본 게임 요소는 다양한 조합 방식으로 Match-3 와 결합하여 동시에 게이머의 안전감, 소속감, 존중과 자아실현 등 여러 단계의 심리적 욕구를 동시에 만족시킬수 있으며, 또한 이 욕구들은 서로 촉진하고 충족시키는 복잡한 상호작용을 형성하였다. 우선 <Royal Match> 의 기초 단계(base layer)는 대표적인 Match-3 규칙, 즉각적인 보너스 지급과 용이성을 통해 게이머의 입문문턱을 크게 낮추었고, 게이머가 빠르게 게임 규칙을 파악하여 쉽게 게임에 참여할 수 있게 하였다. 또한 게임의즉각적인 보너스 지급 메커니즘은 시각과 청각에 대한 긍정적인 강화로 피드백되었다. 예를 들어 매치에 성공할때 발생하는 폭발 효과와 소리는 게이머의 성취감과 통제감을 강화하고, 이는 안정성과 예측 가능성에 대한 게이머의 안전 욕구를 충족시킬 뿐만 아니라 게이머가 게임을 계속하게 만들며, 게임에 대한 몰입과 충성을 강화하였다. 다음으로 보존 단계(retention layer)에서 탄력적인 게임 시간과 계속 업데이트되는 내용은 게이머의 참여감과 소속감을 강화하였다. 이러한 게임 디자인은 명확한 목표와 안정적인 리듬을 제공하는 동시에 게이머의불확실성과 초조함을 감소시키며, 또한 인지와 자아실현에 대한 게이머의 욕구를 충족시켰다. 마지막으로 슈퍼팬 단계(super fans layer)의 어려운 난도의 도전과 커뮤니티 참여 기회는 열정적이고 몰입된 게이머 집단을 이끌고, 존중과 자아 가치에 대한 그들의 추구를 충족시켰다.","In recent years, Royal Match has emerged as one of the most popular new Match-3 games, integrating innovative elements into the traditional Match-3 gameplay. To explore the key reasons behind its success, it is essential to investigate how the game satisfies players' psychological needs from a game design perspective. Given the relative scarcity of research on Match-3 games, an in-depth analysis of Royal Match as a case study is valuable. This approach not only helps us understand how traditional Match-3 games meet player needs through their simple mechanics, but also reveals how new Match-3 games, by incorporating fresh elements, further fulfill players' expectations and demands. This study explores the following question from the perspective of game designers: Based on the hierarchy of player needs theory, how do specific game design elements in Royal Match correspond to and fulfill these various psychological needs? The research proposes a new analytical framework grounded in the pyramid theory of game design elements and the hierarchy of player needs theory, using Royal Match as a case study to analyze how different design layers in the game satisfy players' needs, ranging from basic safety to higher-level self-actualization. The findings reveal that common basic game elements, when combined with Match-3 gameplay, can simultaneously meet players' psychological needs at different levels, including safety, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. Moreover, there is a complex interaction between these needs that both promote and satisfy each other. First, the foundational layer of Royal Match, through its classic Match-3 mechanics and instant reward feedback, significantly lowers the entry barrier for players by being easy to learn, allowing players to quickly master the game rules and engage effortlessly. The instant reward mechanisms, including positive visual and auditory reinforcement such as explosive effects and sound effects after successful matches, enhance players' sense of accomplishment and control. This not only satisfies their need for stability and predictability (safety needs) but also encourages them to continue playing, deepening their engagement and loyalty to the game. Second, in the retention layer, features such as flexible playtime and constantly updated content enhance players' sense of engagement and belonging. This design provides clear goals and a steady pace, reducing players' uncertainty and anxiety while also enhancing their sense of progress and growth within the game. These aspects not only meet safety and self-actualization needs but also fulfill players' cognitive and self-realization needs. Finally, the super fans layer, which includes challenging high-difficulty levels and opportunities for community participation, attracts and retains a highly enthusiastic and committed player base, satisfying their desire for esteem and the pursuit of self-worth."
