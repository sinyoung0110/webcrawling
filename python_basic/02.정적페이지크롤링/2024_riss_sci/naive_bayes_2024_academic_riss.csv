An Analysis of the Predictive Power of Four Models in Machine Learning and Deep Learning: Focusing on the Reviews of the Movie Noryang,2024,"['빅 데이터', '기계학습', '딥러닝', '모델', '인공지능', 'big data', 'machine learning', 'deep learning', 'model', 'AI']",,"This article is two-fold. The ultimate goal of this article is to provide a big data analysis of 330 reviews of the movie Noryang and to evaluate the Naive Bayes model, the Random Forests model, the DNN model, and the LSTM model in machine learning and deep learning. A point to note is that the name Yi, Sun-shin was the most widely used by viewers, followed by the word movie, and the word general, in that order. A major point of this article is that the name Yi, Sun-shin and the word movie showed up twice as the first keyword. This in turn implies that these keywords are the most noteworthy ones. The sentiment analysis argues that about 75% of viewers think of the film as well-made and that they were highly satisfied with it. In this paper, we used the Naive Bayes model, the Random Forests model, the DNN model, and the LSTM model and made them predict whether each review is positive or negative. The Random Forests model works well for our data, whereas the Naive Bayes model does not. When learning took place 25 times, the DNN model worked well for our data (its accuracy rate is 82.76%). When it comes to the LSTM model, its accuracy did not improve even though learning took place 9 times. Yet, the LSTM model is slightly better than the DNN model with respect to the accuracy rate of test data."

Promotion within an organization plays a crucial role in human resource management, as it helps select the desired talents. Various evaluation methods are used to select candidates for promotion. Ensuring a fair evaluation of multiple factors to select individuals who align with the desired talent profile is as crucial as verifying whether each factor is reflected in the actual promotion assessment results. A differential scoring allocation is commonly used to reflect the importance of factors in promotion selection. On the other hand, the impact of those factors on promotion diminishes significantly if the discrimination ability of each evaluation score for promotion candidates is low. This study used the Naive Bayes model to identify factors with significant influence. Moreover, the reputation scores, presently used as reference materials, carry sufficient value as criteria for promotion evaluation.

Health 4.0, the incorporation of computing and AI technologies into healthcare, is driving the industry's digital transformation and improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. AI can help detect diseases such as cancer at an early stage. AI can also lower the healthcare costs by reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies and speeding up the diagnostic process. Machine learning algorithms are commonly utilized in AI-powered healthcare studies and are also used in image-based research to diagnose a variety of diseases since the integration of AI into healthcare holds great potential to improve patient care and reduce costs. In this study, we present a multi-layer machine learning (MLML) method based on the joint use of machine learning algorithms to improve the success of skin cancer diagnosis. In this respect, the MLML method with 3 layers is proposed. In the fi rst layer, decision tree, random forest, neural network, naive bayes, and support vector machine algorithms are used. After executing this layer, 5 diff erent classifi cation results are transferred to the second layer where k-nearest neighbor algorithm is utilized. In the last layer, the results are improved using the linear regression algorithm. Thanks to our method, images in the input dataset are classifi ed into three groups: cancer, not cancer, and early-stage cancer. The multi-layer architecture is utilized to make joint decisions with diff erent machine learning algorithms and remove the limitations of each algorithm so that more accurate decisions can be made. Fourteen feature extraction algorithms that were not previously used in skin cancer images are employed. Inclusion of age, gender, and region of the lesion in the decision-making process in addition to image features also contributes to obtaining better classifi cation results.

In particular, it is crucial for port safety management to consider not only incidents directly 'at-port' but also those in the surrounding 'near-port' areas, including the port influence area. This is significant because of the potential for high crash severity at near port areas, given the substantial truck traffic that could lead to large-scale crashes. Therefore, developing management strategies for port city safety requires identifying key risk factors that influence crash severity in each port area. During this process, because the key factors influencing crash severity may vary as one gets closer to the port center, it is essential to take into account the size of the port influence area. This study collected and matched both crash and weather data to consider various variables. Additionally, this study developed four machine learning-based crash severity models, including Naive Bayes Classification, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine. Furthermore, the identification of key factors influencing high crash severity is determined through the application of an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence technique.
