An Effective Anomaly Detection Approach based on Hybrid Unsupervised Learning Technologies in NIDS,2024,"['Anomaly Detection', 'Data Augmentation', 'Hybrid Approach', 'NIDS', 'Unsupervised Learning Technologies']",,"Internet users are exposed to sophisticated cyberattacks that intrusion detection systems have difficulty detecting. Therefore, research is increasing on intrusion detection methods that use artificial intelligence technology for detecting novel cyberattacks. Unsupervised learning-based methods are being researched that learn only from normal data and detect abnormal behaviors by finding patterns. This study developed an anomaly-detection method based on unsupervised machines and deep learning for a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). We present a hybrid anomaly detection approach based on unsupervised learning techniques using the autoencoder (AE), Isolation Forest (IF), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithms. An oversampling approach that increased the detection rate was also examined. A hybrid approach that combined deep learning algorithms and traditional machine learning algorithms was highly effective in setting the thresholds for anomalies without subjective human judgment. It achieved precision and recall rates respectively of 88.2% and 92.8% when combining two AEs, IF, and LOF while using an oversampling approach to learn more unknown normal data improved the detection accuracy. This approach achieved precision and recall rates respectively of 88.2% and 94.6%, further improving the detection accuracy compared with the hybrid method. Therefore, in NIDS the proposed approach provides high reliability for detecting cyberattacks."

Deep Learning Applied Abnormal Human Behavior Detection in Video Surveillance Systems - A Survey,2024,"['Abnormal Human Behavior Detection', 'Abnormal Human Activity Recognition', 'Anomaly Detection', 'Video Surveillance', 'Deep learning']",,"As society develops, the demand for security is rapidly increasing. Accordingly, there is growing interest in research on methods to detect and prevent abnormal behavior using surveillance cameras in public places and private spaces such as shopping malls and airports for human safety. Many detection techniques based on deep learning models have been researched in the field of abnormal behavior detection. However, due to the lack of labeled abnormal behavior data, there are significant difficulties in developing an effective detection system. This paper surveys methods for deep learning methods to detect abnormal human behavior in surveillance video and presents recent techniques. First, I will introduce popular datasets that have often been used in previous research. After that, we categorized the existing methods for detecting abnormal behavior using deep learning into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and partially-supervised learning. We then explained the basic concepts and advantages of each method and summarized their shortcomings. We also briefly describe future research directions based on the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Based on this, it is expected that the technology of video surveillance systems that apply abnormal behavior detection will further develop."
Adversarial Complementary Learning for Just Noticeable Difference Estimation,2024,"['Just Noticeable Difference (JND)', 'convolutional neural networks', 'Human Visual System (HVS)']",,"Recently, many unsupervised learning-based models have emerged for Just Noticeable Difference (JND) estimation, demonstrating remarkable improvements in accuracy. However, these models suffer from a significant drawback is that their heavy reliance on handcrafted priors for guidance. This restricts the information for estimating JND simply extracted from regions that are highly related to handcrafted priors, while information from the rest of the regions is disregarded, thus limiting the accuracy of JND estimation. To address such issue, on the one hand, we extract the information for estimating JND in an Adversarial Complementary Learning (ACoL) way and propose an ACoL-JND network to estimate the JND by comprehensively considering the handcrafted priors-related regions and non-related regions. On the other hand, to make the handcrafted priors richer, we take two additional priors that are highly related to JND modeling into account, i.e., Patterned Masking (PM) and Contrast Masking (CM). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the existing JND models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective viewing tests and objective metrics assessments."
Unsupervised Manufacturing Fault Detection Based on Self-labeled Training of Fingerprint Image Constructed from Time-Series Data,2024,"['Fault detection', 'Unsupervised learning', 'Anomaly detection', 'One-class classification', 'Deep learning']",,"The acquisition of properly labeled datasets is challenging, which hampers the implementation of industrial deep learning technology in actual manufacturing sites. This paper proposes an unsupervised manufacturing fault detection method based on self-labeled training to remedy the lack of properly labeled datasets. The proposed method comprises a two-step process of time-series imaging, termed fingerprinting, and normality calculation using self-labeled classification in a deep learning architecture. We compared our model with state-of-art one-class classification algorithms using an unlabeled dataset, which was obtained by varying the ratio of production failure samples in datasets. The proposed model exhibited better performance than baseline algorithms in terms of area under receiver operating curve (AUROC), even for the one-class classification using datasets comprising production success cases only. Moreover, more robust performance was observed compared to the baseline algorithms in several contamination conditions of datasets where the datasets comprised different proportions of production failure cases to simulate unlabeled manufacturing data. Our results suggest that the self-labeling-based fault detection model we propose is adaptable to both unsupervised and semi-supervised conditions. It can effectively enhance the detection of defects in scenarios characterized by exceptionally rare failure cases that closely resemble real-world situations."
Automatic crack detection using quantum-inspired firefly algorithm with deep learning techniques,2024,"['bituminous pavements', 'deep learning', 'multi-scale fusion', 'object detection', 'road crack detection', 'self-supervised learning', 'vision transformers']",,"Detecting and quantifying cracks in bituminous (asphalt) road surfaces plays a crucial role in maintaining road infrastructure integrity and enabling cost-effective maintenance strategies. However, traditional manual inspections are laborious, time-intensive, and susceptible to inconsistencies due to factors like human fatigue, varying expertise levels, and subjective assessments. To address these challenges, this research proposes CrackNet, an innovative deep learning framework that harnesses state-of-the-art computer vision and object detection techniques for accurate and computationally efficient automated crack detection in bituminous road imagery. CrackNet introduces a novel hybrid neural network architecture that seamlessly integrates a cutting-edge Vision Transformer backbone with multi-scale convolutional feature fusion modules. The Vision Transformer component excels at capturing long-range structural dependencies and global contextual information, while the multi-scale fusion modules adeptly combine fine-grained crack details across various spatial resolutions. This unique design enables CrackNet to holistically model intricate crack topologies while preserving localized characteristics and intricate details. To further bolster robustness and generalization capabilities across diverse real-world scenarios, CrackNet incorporates self-supervised pre-training techniques that leverage unlabeled data and unsupervised pretext tasks. These strategies allow CrackNet to learn rich visual representations tailored specifically for crack detection. Additionally, an extensive data augmentation pipeline is employed, encompassing geometric, photometric, and adversarial transformations, to enhance model invariance to varying imaging conditions and environmental factors. The accuracy achieved by the newly proposed approach surpasses that of current state-of-the-art methodologies, reaching an impressive 97.8%."

Applications of Big Data and AI-Driven Technologies in High-Dimensional Data Analysis: Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction Using Machine Learning Models with Factor Analysis,2024,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Factor Analysis', 'Corporate Data', 'Bankruptcy Prediction']",,"Artificial intelligence techniques have been developed in the prediction of corporate bankruptcy over time. The first step in the analysis of real-world data on bankrupt companies is to include multicollinearity, which has an adverse impact on biased estimation and possibly causes large errors. Studies in finance have presented potential problems affected by a strong association between the features and the outcome in the dataset, but examining the role of the factor analysis techniques which handle bias in the corporate data is at a nascent stage. The integrative big data analytics can be utilized to combine unsupervised learning to understand the structures of high-dimensional data with supervised learning to classify the target outcome efficiently. In this study, the results of the big data analytics show that random forest classification with factor analysis outperforms other big data analysis techniques in terms of predictive accuracy. The goal of this study is to minimize the gap between the theoretical concepts of artificial intelligence techniques and the analysis of real-world financial data, in addition to developing big data analytics methods on high-dimensional data with strongly associated corporate features.

Dual-stream Co-enhanced Network for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation,2024,"['Unsupervised video object segmentation', 'Dual-stream Co-enhanced', 'Motion refinement', 'Feature aggregation', 'Dual-stream neural network']",,"Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) is a highly challenging problem in computer vision as the annotation of the target object in the testing video is unknown at all. The main difficulty is to effectively handle the complicated and changeable motion state of the target object and the confusion of similar background objects in video sequence. In this paper, we propose a novel deep Dual-stream Co-enhanced Network (DC-Net) for UVOS via bidirectional motion cues refinement and multi-level feature aggregation, which can fully take advantage of motion cues and effectively integrate different level features to produce high-quality segmentation mask. DC-Net is a dual-stream architecture where the two streams are co-enhanced by each other. One is a motion stream with a Motion-cues Refine Module (MRM), which learns from bidirectional optical flow images and produces fine-grained and complete distinctive motion saliency map, and the other is an appearance stream with a Multi-level Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM) and a Context Attention Module (CAM) which are designed to integrate the different level features effectively. Specifically, the motion saliency map obtained by the motion stream is fused with each stage of the decoder in the appearance stream to improve the segmentation, and in turn the segmentation loss in the appearance stream feeds back into the motion stream to enhance the motion refinement. Experimental results on three datasets (Davis2016, VideoSD, SegTrack-v2) demonstrate that DC-Net has achieved comparable results with some state-of-the-art methods."

This has increased operational effi ciency in the medical sector, reduced medical costs, enhanced access to the services of healthcare, and improved patients’ safety. To provide more standard service, a sizable portion of the Health Information Systems today consists of multiple independent systems that were previously built in the past but need to be combined.

Manual brain tumor segmentation is expensive, time-consuming, error-prone, and dependent on the radiologist's expertise and experience. Manual brain tumor segmentation outcomes by different radiologists for the same patient may differ. Thus, more robust, and dependable methods are needed. Medical imaging researchers produced numerous semi-automatic and fully automatic brain tumor segmentation algorithms using ML pipelines and accurate (handcrafted feature-based, etc.) or data-driven strategies. Current methods use CNN or handmade features such symmetry analysis, alignment-based features analysis, or textural qualities. CNN approaches provide unsupervised features, while manual features model domain knowledge. Cascaded algorithms may outperform feature-based or data-driven like CNN methods. A revolutionary cascaded strategy is presented that intelligently supplies CNN with past information from handmade feature-based ML algorithms. Each patient receives manual ground truth and four MRI modalities (T1, T1c, T2, and FLAIR). Handcrafted characteristics and deep learning are used to segment brain tumors in a Global Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN). The proposed GCNN architecture with two parallel CNNs, CSPathways CNN (CSPCNN) and MRI Pathways CNN (MRIPCNN), segmented BraTS brain tumors with high accuracy.

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is used for the segmentation module. The cluster module uses the k-means clustering algorithm, a representative method of unsupervised learning, to determine whether components belong to the same class within the microbial image. Finally, by configuring a user interface, the system was created to return all objects and corresponding components belonging to the same cluster when the user selects an element that wants to be divided. Both the segmentation module and the cluster module can use semi-supervised or unsupervised learning to reduce the cost of work such as data collection and labeling, which has been a problem with the existing image segmentation model."

By quantifying the impact of these variables on consumer opinion evaluation, the study aims to establish an effective online communication strategy for organization-public relations.Methods To measure the effect of communication between consumers and doctors/hospitals on their evaluation, we utilized vitals.com, an online hospital review site in the US. From September 1 to September 8, 2023, we gathered 12,945 reviews for a total of 7,218 doctors from different specialties and hospital locations. By employing a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, we extracted variables from the collected social big data and estimated their effects.Results When considering the total rating as the dependent variable and controlling for factors such as doctors’ characteristics (experience, number of languages, specialties, detailed fields, number of certificates, treatment attitudes), hospital characteristics (number of insurance, waiting times, speed of treatment, employee kindness, number of ratings and reviews), and review content characteristics (number of words used in the review, sentiment of the review), it was found that dialogic communication had a positive impact on the total rating. Furthermore, it was noted that dialogic communication was particularly effective in cases where hospitals and doctors had less experience with negative evaluations related to treatment speed, treatment attitude, and employee kindness.Conclusions This study confirmed the effectiveness of organization-public dialogic communication in the realm of online information search and health communication. It employed the latest techniques and included the largest sample size to date, with a total of 13,000 participants. Additionally, the study unveiled the role of organization-public dialogic communication in influencing the decision-making process of medical consumers, based on the accessibility-diagnosis model. Furthermore, the study utilized machine learning methodology to develop an algorithm that can automatically determine whether reviews are related to organization-public dialogic communication, rather than relying on self-report data. These findings emphasize the importance of organization-public dialogic communication from the perspective of PR practitioners. It suggests that communication aspects sometimes carry more weight in consumers’ judgments of hospitals/doctors than characteristics such as employee kindness, number of specialties, and number of certificates."

Clustering is mainly used for such unsupervised learning. One of the representative methods of such clustering is K-means clustering. Since K-means clustering is a method of determining the number of clusters and continuing to find the central point of the data allocated to the cluster, there is a problem that the clustered group may not be the optimal cluster. In this study, particle swarm optimization algorithm, which determines the motion vector by adding various variables as well as the center point, is applied to K-means clustering. The improved K-means clustering makes it possible to move toward better outcome values even when the center of cluster no longer change. In the conventional clustering method, the center of the cluster moves to the center of the data belonging to the cluster, and clustering ends when the cluster does not change, so other characteristics other than the center value are excluded. Unlike the conventional clustering method, the improved clustering method uses a central value, an average value, and a random value as variables, and a particle swarm optimization algorithm that modifies the vector for each iteration is applied. As a result, improved clustering method derived a better result value than the existing clustering method in the group's fitness index, silhouette score."

Furthermore, T-test and ANOVA were used to reveal statistically significant differences between ESG non-financial data, and correlation coefficients were used to confirm the relationships between ESG indicators. Based on these results, this study suggests the possibility of estimating the ESG performance ranking of each public institution without existing ESG ratings. This is achieved by calculating the optimal number of clusters, and then determining the sum of averages of the ESG data within each cluster. Therefore, the proposed model can be employed to evaluate the ESG ratings of various domestic public institutions, and it is expected to be useful in domestic sustainable management practice and performance management."

Typically, the information that can be collected in real-time under limited equipment conditions on ships includes wave and offshore wind data. In this study, we developed an algorithm that produces marine environment prediction information for subsequent time periods based solely on time series observation data from the route. This prediction information integrates four types of artificial intelligence algorithms (ANN, RNN, Conv-LSTM, and GAN) and two learning structure methods (ultra-short-term - discontinuous and long-term - continuous).

Since it is very difficult to acquire fault data in the field, unsupervised learning methods that can be trained using only normal state data are mainly used. However, unsupervised learning methods are very vulnerable to disturbances and are difficult to express the fault level. Disturbances in the field include electrical noise, which can cause data acquisition devices to fail due to low power quality in the field and affect the measured signal, and mechanical noise, such as external vibrations, which directly affect the operation of the electric motor. To minimize the impact of electrical noise, it is common to use hardware filters. Unlike previous studies that use theoretical cutoff frequency setting methods, this paper proposes a method to find the appropriate cutoff frequency using LRP(Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) analysis, one of the XAI(eXplainable A.I) techniques, for practical data acquisition.Fault diagnosis in the field requires robust unsupervised learning algorithms that can ignore the presence of mechanical noise in the signal, such as transient shocks. This is solved by post-processing the output of the auto-encoder with a moving average filter. To represent the fault level a data generation technique, the mix-up algorithm, is used. A method is proposed to threshold the auto-encoder multiple times with data generated by the mix-up algorithm. This proposed method shows the availability of motor fault diagnosis considering the on-site data."

Identification of Preeclamptic Placenta in Whole Slide Images Using Artificial Intelligence Placenta Analysis,2024,"['Placenta', 'Preeclampsia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Unsupervised Learning']",,"Background: Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive pregnancy disorder linked to placental dysfunction, often involving pathological lesions like acute atherosis, decidual vasculopathy, accelerated villous maturation, and fibrinoid deposition. However, there is no gold standard for the pathological diagnosis of PE and this limits the ability of clinicians to distinguish between PE and non-PE pregnancies. Recent advances in computational pathology have provided the opportunity to automate pathological analysis for diagnosis, classification, prediction, and prediction of disease progression. In this study, we assessed whether computational pathology could be used to identify PE placentas.Methods: A total of 168 placental whole-slide images (WSIs) of patients from Seoul National University Hospital (comprising 84 PE cases and 84 normal controls) were used for model development and internal validation. For external validation of the model, 76 placental slides (including 38 PE cases and 38 normal controls) were obtained from the Boramae Medical Center (BMC). To establish standard criteria for diagnosing PE and distinguishing it from controls using placental WSIs, patch characteristics and quantification of terminal and intermediate villi were employed. In unsupervised learning, K-means clustering was conducted as a feature obtained through an Auto Encoder to extract the ratio of each cluster for each WSI. For supervised learning, quantitative assessments of the villi were obtained using a U-Net-based segmentation algorithm. The prediction model was developed using an ensemble method and was compared with a clinical feature model developed by using placental size features.Results: Using ensemble modeling, we developed a model to identify PE placentas.The model showed good performance (area under the precision-recall curve [AUPRC], 0.771; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.752–0.790), with 77.3% of sensitivity and 71.1% of specificity, whereas the clinical feature model showed an AUPRC 0.713 (95% CI, 0.694–0.732) with 55.6% sensitivity and 86.8% specificity. External validation of the predictive model employing the BMC-derived set of placental slides also showed good discrimination (AUPRC, 0.725; 95% CI, 0.720–0.730).Conclusion: The proposed computational pathology model demonstrated a strong ability to identify preeclamptic placentas. Computational pathology has the potential to improve the identification of PE placentas."
Spatio-Temporal Graph Normalizing Flows (STG-NF) 기반 공공장소 이상 탐지 일반화에 관한 연구,2024,"['Generation Model', 'Video Anomaly Detection', 'Deep Learning', 'Graph Convolution', 'Closed-Circuit Television']",,"Recently, there has been a growing adoption of deep-learning-based anomaly detection in Closed-Circuit Television systems for enhanced security in public spaces. Most of these video surveillance systems employ an unsupervised learning approach, relying on exclusive training with normal data for anomaly detection. This is achieved through the use of an autoencoder structure that processes RGB data, mainly due to the challenges associated with defining all abnormal behaviors. However, this approach encounters a reduction in recognition accuracy when the environment or location changes. To address this issue, there is a need for an additional step involving the collection of environment-specific data. In this paper, we adopt Spatial-Temporal Convolution Network to analyze skeleton data by constructing a spatiotemporally connected graph from video data and performing graph convolution. The proposed module interprets poses and movements in successive video frames based on information extracted from human joint data. Furthermore, to overcome the limited anomaly detection performance caused by the generalization performance boundary issue in existing autoencoder-based anomaly detection, we propose a normalized flow model to learn normal data and to discriminate anomalous data. Processing skeleton-based data and implementing anomaly detection through normalized flow not only minimizes the impact of environmental factors but also ensures consistent performance across diverse settings. This approach overcomes the limitations associated with autoencoder models relying on RGB data, making it applicable and effective in public spaces. In this paper, we additionally define anomalous behaviors that commonly observed in real public spaces, such as instances of fainting integrated into the dataset for a more practical anomaly detection and robust against environmental factors and it is evaluated using existing open datasets, demonstrating its capacity to operate realistically across diverse environments."

Signals from rotating and non-rotating equipment included in the Malfunctioning Industrial Machine Investigation and Inspection (MIMII) dataset were applied to a deep learning model. We applied unsupervised learning methods utilizing the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Domain Adaptation Neural Network (DANN). First, VAEs were utilized to diagnose the fault. The statistical features of the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) coefficients of the acoustic signal were utilized to extract features that can be used regardless of the length of the audio signal. Considering the characteristics of rotating equipment, feature enhancement was performed by applying Magnitude Spectral Subtraction and feature lightweight, and data augmentation was performed by utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on the extracted features. Although VAE can create a fault classifier using only steady-state data, improving and augmenting the features was necessary considering the characteristics of non-rotating and rotating equipment. The increased ambient noise reduced the accuracy, showing that VAE can accurately diagnose failures. The data used for training contains a domain shift between the laboratory environment and the actual operating environment, which represents a problem where a fault classifier trained on data from the laboratory environment may have poor diagnostic performance in the real world. To solve this problem, a Domain Adaptive Neural Network (DANN) was applied. DANN does not require additional data processing and can utilize labels from the source domain to diagnose faults in the target domain. By utilizing the advantages of the above two methods, we showed that fault diagnosis can be adapted even if the environment of a given equipment changes by combining the procedures according to the noise situation."

Therefore, research is underway to address issues like security intrusions, abnormal network activity, and service disruptions using cloud time-series anomaly detection. An anomaly detection is defined as identifying a specific point in time where the system's behavior significantly deviates from its previous normal state. Although machine learning techniques have begun to be utilized to handle large volumes of cloud data, the lack of labeled data has led most anomaly detection research to rely on unsupervised learning models, specifically deep learning methods. This study also trained and compared the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models with demonstrated effectiveness in previous time-series anomaly detection studies—namely, LSTM-AE, GMM-GRU-VAE, and GDN—using time-series data collected from an actual cloud operating environment. The GDN model achieved the highest performance with an AUPRC of 0.7488 and a BestTS F1 score of 0.9894, with the shortest testing time of just 10 minutes. LSTM-AE followed with an AUPRC of 0.7378 and a BestTS F1 score of 0.9594. The GMM-GRU-VAE model outperformed LSTM-AE in time-series prediction but ranked lowest in overall performance due to its AUPRC score of 0.7229. Therefore, GDN is evaluated as the most suitable model for time-series data analysis in cloud infrastructure, proving advantageous in environments requiring rapid processing time and high predictive accuracy."

Anomaly-based Alzheimer's disease detection using entropy-based probability Positron Emission Tomography images,2024,"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'anomaly detection', 'deep learning', 'entropy analysis', 'PET imaging']",,"Deep neural networks trained on labeled medical data face major challenges owing to the economic costs of data acquisition through expensive medical imaging devices, expert labor for data annotation, and large datasets to achieve optimal model performance. The heterogeneity of diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, further complicates deep learning because the test cases may substantially differ from the training data, possibly increasing the rate of false positives. We propose a reconstruction-based self-supervised anomaly detection model to overcome these challenges. It has a dual-subnetwork encoder that enhances feature encoding augmented by skip connections to the decoder for improving the gradient flow. The novel encoder captures local and global features to improve image reconstruction. In addition, we introduce an entropy-based image conversion method. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed model outperforms benchmark models in anomaly detection and classification using an encoder. The supervised and unsupervised models show improved performances when trained with data preprocessed using the proposed image conversion method."
Preemptive Failure Detection using Contamination-Based Stacking Ensemble in Missiles,2024,"['Weapon System', 'Missile', 'Quality Control', 'Anomaly Detection', 'Unsupervised Learning']",,"In modern warfare, missiles play a pivotal role but typically spend the majority of their lifecycle in long-term storage or standby mode, making it difficult to detect failures. Preemptive detection of missiles that will fail is crucial to preventing severe consequences, including safety hazards and mission failures. This study proposes a contamination-based stacking ensemble model, employing the local outlier factor (LOF), to detect such missiles. The proposed model creates multiple base LOF models with different contamination values and combines their anomaly scores to achieve a robust anomaly detection. A comparative performance analysis was conducted between the proposed model and the traditional single LOF model, using production-related inspection data from missiles deployed in the military. The experimental results showed that, with the contamination parameter set to 0.1, the proposed model exhibited an increase of approximately 22 percentage points in accuracy and 71 percentage points in F1-score compared to the single LOF model. This approach enables the preemptive identification of potential failures, undetectable through traditional statistical quality control methods. Consequently, it contributes to lower missile failure rates in real battlefield scenarios, leading to significant time and cost savings in the military industry."

This study aims to understand the mechanisms, migration paths, and activity patterns of ADSs, which are essential for issuing timely warnings and aiding in atmospheric environment research. Using unsupervised learning methods, including the principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering, we analyzed the mega ADS events from 2002 to 2022 based on the ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data. We identified key meteorological factors, including geopotential height and temperature at lower levels (800–1000 hPa), and classified synoptic patterns associated to the mega ADSs during the origination stages in the source regions and the peak concentration stages in Korea. Findings highlight that, during the origination stage, enhanced troughs and high temperature at low levels are primary factors affecting atmospheric instability and consequently strong updrafts that lift dust particles, combined with high planetary boundary layer heights, ranging 1400─2950 m, and strong pressure gradients at the source regions. It is further noted that low-level temperature and specific humidity are critical during the peak stages in Korea, with contributions from higher atmospheric levels. Variability in atmospheric conditions among different patterns affects dust concentrations, with certain patterns experiencing sharp declines in humidity leading to peak dust events. Noting also that the mega ADSs occur under specific synoptic patterns classified at both the origination stages and the peak concentration stages in Korea, this comprehensive analysis provides crucial insights into the dynamics and prediction of mega ADSs in Korea."
