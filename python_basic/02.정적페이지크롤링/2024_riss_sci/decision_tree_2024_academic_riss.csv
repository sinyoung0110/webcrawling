Analysis of High-Growth Factors and Support Strategy Development for SMEs in Gyeongnam Using Decision Tree Analysis,2024,"['Gyeongnam Companies', 'Support Project', 'High Growth', 'Decision Tree', 'Data Mining']",,"This study analyzed the factors that influence the high growth beneficiary companies in the Gyeongnam Technopark support project. To this end, experimental data were analyzed by constructing a prediction model consisting of highly important variables in beneficiary company decisions, identified among a variety of company information, using the decision tree model. The primary role of the decision tree model is to simplify the understanding of complex data. It hierarchically analyzes the impact of various variables on the outcomes, making it easy to identify key decision factors. In addition, it enhances prediction accuracy by eliminating less important variables and prioritizing significant ones during the classification process, thereby deriving effective decision-making rules. This study, identified ‘years in business’ and ‘revenue’ as key variables from the sales perspective compared to ‘total liabilities’ and ‘years in business’ from the employment perspective. In addition, various rules were derived to determine the beneficiary companies of the Gyeongnam Technopark’s support project using the analysis results expressed as decision trees. Three policy measures were presented based on the important rules that repeatedly appear in different predictive models to increase the effect of Gyeongnam Technopark’s industrial development. First, customized support programs should be expanded to assist companies in areas such as technology, management, market entry, and talent acquisition. Second, financial support and consulting should be strengthened to reduce debt burdens and improve financial soundness. Third, focused support should be provided to early-stage and newly established companies, especially young firms, to maximize their growth potential. Using the analysis methods presented in this study and the determinants of the beneficiary companies of the Gyeongnam Technopark support project will help create a sustainable future growth environment for both high growth and employment growth in the region."

Subsequently, a decision tree model was developed to predict traffic accidents using a training and validation dataset split in a 70:30 ratio.RESULTS: The results indicated that 45.1% of FDRs had been involved in a traffic accident. The decision tree model identified several significant predictors of traffic accidents, including delivering food in the rain, job stress, fatigue, inadequate sleep, and the use of a modified motorcycle, achieving a prediction accuracy of 66.5%.CONCLUSIONS: Based on this model, we recommend several measures to minimize accidents among FDRs: ensuring adequate sleep, implementing work-rest schedules to mitigate fatigue, managing job-related stress effectively, inspecting motorcycle conditions before use, and exercising increased caution when delivering food during rainy conditions."
"Health Star Rating of Nonalcoholic, Packaged, and Ready-to-Drink Beverages in Türkiye: A  Decision Tree Model Study",2024,"['beverages', 'food quality', 'nutrient intake', 'nutritive value', 'sugar-sweetened beverages']",,"This study aimed to compare the nutritional quality of beverages sold in Türkiye according to their labeling profiles. A total of 304 nonalcoholic beverages sold in supermarkets and online markets with the highest market capacity in Türkiye were included. Milk and dairy products, sports drinks, and beverages for children were excluded. The health star rating (HSR) was used to assess the nutritional quality of beverages. The nutritional quality of beverages was evaluated using a decision tree model according to the HSR score based on the variables presented on the beverage label. Moreover, confusion matrix tests were used to test the model’s accuracy. The mean HSR score of beverages was 2.6±1.9, of which 30.2% were in the healthy category (HSR≥3.5). Fermented and 100% fruit juice beverages had the highest mean HSR scores. According to the decision tree model of the training set, the predictors of HSR quality score, in order of importance, were as follows: added sugar (46%), sweetener (28%), additives (19%), fructose-glucose syrup (4%), and caffeine (3%). In the test set, the accuracy rate and F1 score were 0.90 and 0.82, respectively, suggesting that the prediction performance of our model had the perfect fit. According to the HSR classification, most beverages were found to be unhealthy. Thus, they increase the risk of the development of obesity and other diseases because of their easy consumption. The decision tree learning algorithm could guide the population to choose healthy beverages based on their labeling information."

A Decision Tree Based Ultra-high-speed Protection Scheme for Meshed MMC-MTDC Grids with Hybrid Lines,2024,['Multi terminal direct current (MTDC) · Modular multi-level converter (MMC) · Protection · Single-ended fault detection · Decision tree (DT) · Wind energy'],,"The reliable operation of modular multi-level converter based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (MMC-MTDC) grids requires high-speed and selective DC line protection. A single-ended protection technique is proposed for MTDC grids with ofshore wind farms and hybrid lines that involve overhead lines and submarine cables in series. Positive and negative poles’ currents at one end of each line section are analyzed using discrete wavelet analysis (DWA). To classify fault type and identify fault zone, a fne decision tree is supplied with an energy index and the envelope slop of detail 1 coefcient (D1) obtained from DWA. Only 0.2 ms following the fault inception are needed for calculating the energy index and the envelope slope to perform relay functions. The approach was tested on a three-terminal two-poles ± 400 kV MMC-MTDC model. The simulation results validate the efectiveness of the suggested protection technique under various fault scenarios, even with up to 200 Ω fault resistance. The proposed technique is not only able to detect the faulty line, but also it identifes overhead line faults and submarine cable faults for hybrid type lines. Moreover, the proposed technique is not afected by wind power injection changes, AC faults, or data noise. The simulated model was produced in the MATLAB/Simulink platform"
A Study on Factors Promoting Green Consumption through Decision Tree Analysis,2024,"['Green Consumption', 'Decision Tree', 'Trust in Green Products', 'Self- Efficacy', 'Policy Awareness']",,"Purpose: This study aims to analyze the factors promoting green consumption among Chinese consumers. Based on previous research, it utilizes analytical/ predictive techniques to identify the factors that significantly influence the shift towards green consumption behaviors among Chinese consumers.Research design, data, and methodology: To analyze the green consumption behaviors of Chinese consumers, factors influencing green consumption were identified through a review of existing literature, followed by an analysis of recent policies related to green consumption in China. This study employs the decision tree model f or analysis, u sing the CHAID algorithm, known f or i ts p redictive power, after conducting surveys to collect data suitable for the model and validating their reliability and validity.Results: The most significant factor affecting green consumption behaviors among Chinese consumers was found to be ‘trust in green products,’ followed by ‘self-efficacy.’ It was observed that groups with high self-efficacy showed an increase in green consumption up to 82.5%. The third key factor identified was ‘policy awareness,’ with groups scoring high on all three factors exhibiting green consumption behaviors over 86%.

The Prediction Model of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury in Psychiatric Patients Using Decision Tree Analysis,2024,"['Non-suicidal self-injury', 'emotion regulation', 'rumination', 'problematic alcohol use', 'working memory']",,"Purpose: The prevalence rate of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in the clinical population is higher than that in the community sample, necessitating the need to investigate the predicting factors of NSSI in this group. The present study aimed to develop a prediction model of NSSI among psychiatric patients in Korea.Materials and Methods: Decision tree analysis was conducted on a sample of 224 psychiatric patients. Emotion regulation strate gies (rumination, cognitive reappraisal, and expressive suppression), impulsivity, problematic alcohol use, working memory, de pressive mood, and gender were included in the model as predictors of NSSI.Results: Results indicated that rumination, problematic alcohol use, and working memory predicted lifetime NSSI engagement among psychiatric patients. The best predictor of lifetime NSSI engagement was rumination. Specifically, when the level of rumi nation was high, the level of working memory was lower, and the risk of NSSI was higher. In the case of low levels of rumination, the higher the level of problematic alcohol use, the higher the risk of NSSI. The highest prevalence of lifetime NSSI engagement was found in a subgroup of patients with high levels of rumination and low levels of working memory.Conclusion: The major contribution of this study is finding a combination of factors to predict the high-risk group of NSSI among psychiatric patients in Korea. This study provides evidence on the effect of rumination, working memory, and problematic alco hol use on NSSI. It is suggested that clinicians and researchers should pay more attention to emotion regulation and related vul nerabilities in preventing and treating NSSI."
Zero-suppressed ternary decision diagram algorithm for solving noncoherent fault trees in probabilistic safety assessment of nuclear power plants,2024,"['Zero-suppressed ternary decision diagram', 'Minimal cut sets', 'Prime implicants']",,"Probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) plays a critical role in ensuring the safe operation of nuclear power plants.In PSA, event trees are developed to identify accident sequences that could lead to core damage. These event trees are then transformed into a core-damage fault tree, wherein the accident sequences are represented by usual and complemented logic gates representing failed and successful operations of safety systems, respectively.The core damage frequency (CDF) is estimated by calculating the minimal cut sets (MCSs) of the core-damage fault tree.Delete-term approximation (DTA) is commonly employed to approximately solve MCSs representing accident sequence logics from noncoherent core-damage fault trees. However, DTA can lead to an overestimation of CDF, particularly when fault trees contain many nonrare events. To address this issue, the present study introduces a new zero-suppressed ternary decision diagram (ZTDD) algorithm that averts the CDF overestimation caused by DTA.This ZTDD algorithm can optionally calculate MCSs with DTA or prime implicants (PIs) without any approximation from the core-damage fault tree. By calculating PIs, accurate CDF can be calculated.The present study provides a comprehensive explanation of the ZTDD structure, formula of the ZTDD algorithm, ZTDD minimization, probability calculation from ZTDD, strength of the ZTDD algorithm, and ZTDD application results. Results reveal that the ZTDD algorithm is a powerful tool that can quickly and accurately calculate CDF and drastically improve the safety of nuclear power plants."
기후변화적응형 도시림 조성을 위한 i-Tree Canopy 기반,2024,"['Climate crisis', 'NbS(Nature based Solution)', 'Urban forest', 'CAPI(Climate Adaptation Performance Index)', 'Blue Green Solutions']",,"The accelerated pace of climate crisis due to continuous industrialization and greenhouse gas emissions necessitates sustainable solutions that simultaneously address mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have gained prominence as viable approaches, with Green Infrastructure being a representative NbS. Green Infrastructure involves securing green spaces within urban areas, providing diverse climate adaptation functions such as removal of various air pollutants, carbon sequestration, and isolation. The proliferation of Green Infrastructure is influenced by the quantification of improvement effects related to various projects. To support decision-making by assessing the climate vulnerability of Green Infrastructure, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has developed i-Tree Tools. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation approach for climate change adaptation types by quantifying the climate adaptation performance of urban Green Infrastructure. Using i-Tree Canopy, the analysis focuses on five urban green spaces covering more than 30 hectares, considering the tree ratio relative to the total area. The evaluation encompasses aspects of thermal environment, aquatic environment, and atmospheric environment to assess the overall eco-friendliness in terms of climate change adaptation. The results indicate that an increase in the tree ratio correlates with improved eco-friendliness in terms of thermal, aquatic, and atmospheric environments. In particular, it is necessary to prioritize consideration of the water environment sector in order to realize climate change adaptive green infrastructure, such as increasing green space in urban areas, as it has been confirmed that four out of five target sites are specialized in improving the water environment."
Multi-dimensional Contextual Conditions-driven Mutually Exclusive Learning for Explainable AI in Decision-Making,2024,"['Mutually Exclusive Learning', 'Multi-dimensional Contextual Conditions', 'Explainable AI (XAI)', 'Mutually Exclusive Decision-Making']",,"There are various machine learning techniques such as Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Network Learning, and so on. In recent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are popularly used for Generative AI based on Reinforcement Learning. It makes decisions with the most optimal rewards through the fine tuning process in a particular situation. Unfortunately, LLMs can not provide any explanation for how they reach the goal because the training is based on learning of black-box AI. Reinforcement Learning as black-box AI is based on graph-evolving structure for deriving enhanced solution through adjustment by human feedback or reinforced data. In this research, for mutually exclusive decision-making, Mutually Exclusive Learning (MEL) is proposed to provide explanations of the chosen goals that are achieved by a decision on both ends with specified conditions. In MEL, decision-making process is based on the tree-based structure that can provide processes of pruning branches that are used as explanations of how to achieve the goals. The goal can be reached by trade-off among mutually exclusive alternatives according to the specific contextual conditions.Therefore, the tree-based structure is adopted to provide feasible solutions with the explanations based on the pruning branches. The sequence of pruning processes can be used to provide the explanations of the inferences and ways to reach the goals, as Explainable AI (XAI). The learning process is based on the pruning branches according to the multi-dimensional contextual conditions. To deep-dive the search, they are composed of time window to determine the temporal perspective, depth of phases for lookahead and decision criteria to prune branches. The goal depends on the policy of the pruning branches, which can be dynamically changed by configured situation with the specific multi-dimensional contextual conditions at a particular moment. The explanation is represented by the chosen episode among the decision alternatives according to configured situations. In this research, MEL adopts the tree-based learning model to provide explanation for the goal derived with specific conditions. Therefore, as an example of mutually exclusive problems, employment process is proposed to demonstrate the decision-making process of how to reach the goal and explanation by the pruning branches. Finally, further study is discussed to verify the effectiveness of MEL with experiments."
Detection and Prevention of Black Hole Attack using Tree Hierarchical Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Enhanced Identity-based Encryption in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network,2024,"['Tree hierarchical deep convolutional neural network', 'Improved k-means clustering algorithm', 'Enhanced identity-based encryption algorithm', 'Black hole attack']",,"A method for the recognition and prevention of a black hole attack is proposed using a tree hierarchical deep convolutional neural network (THDCNN)and enhanced identity based encryption in a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). Automobiles are organized with a cluster formula using an improved k-means clustering algorithm. Following the cluster formation, cluster head (CH) selection is done using a balancing composite motion optimization (BCMO) algorithm. After selecting the cluster head, the entrance of a spiteful node occurs in the cluster. The THDCNN is proposed for classifying a cluster node as i) a black hole attack node or ii) a normal node. If a black hole attack node is found, the attack node information is communicated to an individual CH, which makes a final decision. Otherwise, the standard node data is encrypted with the enhanced identity-based encryption algorithm. Finally, the proposed method prevents the normal node data from the attacker. Thus, the proposed method attains higher accuracy and lower computational time than other methods."

The data was analyzed by a decision tree model using SPSS 26.0. Our analysis revealed several findings. First, the group with the highest prevalence of general anxiety exhibited the following characteristics: high stress levels, experiences of sadness and despair, negative subjective health perception, inadequate fatigue recovery after sleep, and regular consumption of high- caffeine beverages. Stress emerged as the most significant predictor of anxiety. Third, the experience of sadness and despair was the second most significant variable affecting the prevalence of anxiety in both groups with below-average or high stress. Furthermore, self-rated ‘ill health’ was found to correlate with an increased prevalence of high-level generalized anxiety. This correlation was further analyzed according to subjective health perception and fatigue recovery after sleep, with or without the experience of sadness and despair. In addition, within the group with poor subjective health and insufficient recovery from fatigue after sleep, high- level anxiety was more prevalent among those consuming high-caffeine beverages more than once a week. General anxiety in adolescents can be predicted by a combination of health cognitive, psycho-emotional, and health behavior factors, including stress, experiences of sadness and despair, subjective health perceptions, fatigue recovery from after sleep, and consumption of high-caffeine beverages. Therefore, these five predictors identified by the decision tree model are crucial considerations for managing high-level general anxiety in adolescents."

The incidence of falls was 15.9% in 2017 and 6.4% in 2020. The decrease in reported incidents of falls during the COVID-19 pandemicis attributed to the reduced outdoor activities and restrictions on mobility, which naturally result in fewer opportunities for falls to occur. In summarizing the decision tree analysis findings from 2020 and 2017, it is evident that hospitalization, low health satisfaction, and challengesin performing independent activities of daily living are factors associated with an increased risk of falling.

To this end, we used decision-making tools to analyze changes in carbon emissions due to revisions to construction standards for planting works. In addition, the carbon storage of trees after completion, the annual carbon absorption amount and carbon absorptio n after 20 years were calculated. As a result of the analysis, construction standards for planting works were being revised in the direction of increasing carbon emissions. Twenty years after completion, the amount of carbon absorbed by trees offset twice the amount of carbon emitted during the planting process. Specifically, small to medium sized trees were effective in reducing carbon emissions and increasing absorption. Meanwhile, pine trees were unable to offset carbon even after 20 years. Based on these results, the following implications can be provided. First, the planting construction standards will have to be revised in the direction of reducing the amount of machinery construction. Second, it is necessary to use fuel-efficient excavators for planting work. Third, a planting strategy centered on small to medium sized trees is required. Fourth, pine trees should be replaced with tree species with high carbon performance."

The distribution across fields was as follows: social science (377 papers, 35.07%), natural science (233 papers, 21.67%), and engineering (230 papers, 21.40%). Among the algorithms, CHAID was used most frequently (315 times, 36.42%), followed by CART (310 times, 35.84%), ensemble techniques like random forest (124 times, 14.34%), and C5.0 (94 times, 10.87%). The Quest algorithm was rarely used (10 times, 1.16%). The annual usage trends indicate a growing preference for ensemble techniques to enhance decision tree prediction rates. The paper's keywords included “decision trees” (687), “data mining” (239), “machine learning” (105), “logistic” (98), and “neural networks” (68). Notably, keywords related to health, such as “suicide,” “depression,” “high blood pressure,” and “health,” emerged prominently, signifying the extensive use of decision trees in medical research. Based on these findings, we propose implications and directions for follow-up studies."

Simulator-based driving behavior data do not necessarily represent the actual driving behavior data. An evaluation must be performed to determine whether driving simulations accurately reflect road safety conditions. The main objective of this study was to establish a methodology for assessing whether simulation-based driving behavior data represent real-world safety characteristics.METHODS : A 500-m spatial window size and a 100-m moving size were used to aggregate and match the driving behavior indicators and crash data. A correlation analysis was performed to identify statistically significant indicators among the various evaluation metrics correlated with crash frequency on the road. A set of driving behavior evaluation indicators highly correlated with crash frequency was used as inputs for the negative binomial and decision tree models. Negative binomial model results revealed the indicators used to estimate the number of predicted crashes. The decision-tree model results prioritized the driving behavior indicators used to classify high-risk road segments.RESULTS : The indicators derived from the negative binomial model analysis were the standard deviation of the peak-to-peak jerk and the time-varying volatility of the yaw rate. Their importance was ranked first and fifth, respectively, using the proposed decision tree model. Each indicator has a significant importance among all indicators, suggesting that certain indicators can accurately reflect actual road safety.CONCLUSIONS : The proposed indicators are expected to enhance the reliability of driving-simulator-based road safety evaluations."

The framework originated from the PSA of nuclear power plants, which aims to assess the risk of reactor core damage. The original PSA method was modified to adopt the characteristics of a process plant whose purpose is continuous operation without shutdown. Therefore, a fault tree, whose top event is shut down, was constructed and transformed into a Bayesian Network (BN), a probabilistic graph model, for efficient risk-informed decision-making. In this research, the fault tree-based BN from the previous research is further developed to consider the multi-hazard of earthquake-induced fire and explosion (EQ-induced F&E). For this purpose, an event tree describing the occurrence of fire and explosion from a release is first constructed and transformed into a BN. And then, this BN is connected to the previous BN model developed for seismic PSA. A virtual plot plan of a gas plant is introduced as a basis for the construction of the specific EQ-induced F&E BN to test the proposed BN framework. The paper demonstrates the method through two examples of risk-informed decision-making. In particular, the second example verifies how the proposed method can establish a repair and retrofit strategy when a shutdown occurs in a process plant."

연합 학습 환경에서의 랜덤 포레스트 알고리즘 최적화 전략 연구,2024,"['연합 학습', '랜덤 포레스트', '분산 환경', 'Federated Learning', 'Random Forest', 'Distributed Environment']",,"Federated learning has garnered attention as an efficient method for training machine learning models in a distributed environment while maintaining data privacy and security. This study proposes a novel FedRFBagging algorithm to optimize the performance of random forest models in such federated learning environments. By dynamically adjusting the trees of local random forest models based on client-specific data characteristics, the proposed approach reduces communication costs and achieves high prediction accuracy even in environments with numerous clients. This method adapts to various data conditions, significantly enhancing model stability and training speed. While random forest models consist of multiple decision trees, transmitting all trees to the server in a federated learning environment results in exponentially increasing communication overhead, making their use impractical. Additionally, differences in data distribution among clients can lead to quality imbalances in the trees. To address this, the FedRFBagging algorithm selects only the highest-performing trees from each client for transmission to the server, which then reselects trees based on impurity values to construct the optimal global model. This reduces communication overhead and maintains high prediction performance across diverse data distributions. Although the global model reflects data from various clients, the data characteristics of each client may differ. To compensate for this, clients further train additional trees on the global model to perform local optimizations tailored to their data. This improves the overall model’s prediction accuracy and adapts to changing data distributions. Our study demonstrates that the FedRFBagging algorithm effectively addresses the communication cost and performance issues associated with random forest models in federated learning environments, suggesting its applicability in such settings."

However, there are concerns about the league’s sustainability as most teams rely on the financial support of their parent corporations. Research to improve this revenue structure is essential for high-quality league operations. Predicting attendance in advance could greatly assist team management. To address this, this study proposes a model to predict the attendance of Korean professional baseball games by incorporating internet search volume as a variable. Previous research on attendance prediction has traditionally focused on independent variables such as weather, day of the week, precipitation, air quality, and winning or losing streaks. However, considering that media consumption primarily occurs online in modern society, the search volume for baseball-related keywords should be included in the attendance prediction model. Therefore, this study proposes a new attendance prediction model using Multiple Linear Regression, LGBM, and Extra Trees by adding the keyword search volume variable in addition to the traditional independent variables. As a result, the prediction models proposed in this study showed improved results in all three models compared to the models that did not include the keyword search volume variable, and the attribute importance evaluation also showed that keyword search volume dominated, indicating that it is an important variable for predicting attendance. Based on these results, it is expected that a more accurate prediction of attendance using various keyword search volumes will be helpful in strategic planning and decision-making to improve the revenue structure of teams."

Patients with high risk factors or those who met the Sedlis criteria were considered adjuvant therapy risk (+); others were considered adjuvant therapy risk (-). A decision-tree model using preoperative variables was constructed to predict the risk of adjuvant therapy.Results Of 886 patients, 362 were adjuvant therapy risk (+) (40.9%). The decision-tree model with four distinct adjuvant therapy risks using tumor size and age were generated. Specifically, patients with tumor size ≤2.45 cm had low risk (49/367; 13.4%), those with tumor size ≤3.85 cm and >2.45 cm had moderate risk (136/314; 43.3%), those with tumor size >3.85 cm and age ≤39.5 years had high risk (92/109; 84.4%), and those with tumor size >3.85 cm and age >39.5 years had the highest risk (85/96; 88.5%).Conclusion The risk of postoperative adjuvant therapy in young patients with early stage cervical cancer can be predicted using preoperative variables. We can decide whether ovarian transposition should be performed using the predicted risk."
A New Multi-Layer Machine Learning (MLML) Architecture for Non-invasive Skin Cancer Diagnosis on Dermoscopic Images,2024,['Skin cancer  · Diagnosis  · Dermoscopic images  · Machine learning  · Multi-layer architecture  · MLML'],,"Artifi cial intelligence (AI) has signifi cantly impacted the healthcare industry, enabling the development of advanced medical devices and software that provide effi cient and precise treatments. Health 4.0, the incorporation of computing and AI technologies into healthcare, is driving the industry's digital transformation and improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. AI can help detect diseases such as cancer at an early stage. AI can also lower the healthcare costs by reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies and speeding up the diagnostic process. Machine learning algorithms are commonly utilized in AI-powered healthcare studies and are also used in image-based research to diagnose a variety of diseases since the integration of AI into healthcare holds great potential to improve patient care and reduce costs. In this study, we present a multi-layer machine learning (MLML) method based on the joint use of machine learning algorithms to improve the success of skin cancer diagnosis. In this respect, the MLML method with 3 layers is proposed. In the fi rst layer, decision tree, random forest, neural network, naive bayes, and support vector machine algorithms are used. After executing this layer, 5 diff erent classifi cation results are transferred to the second layer where k-nearest neighbor algorithm is utilized. In the last layer, the results are improved using the linear regression algorithm. Thanks to our method, images in the input dataset are classifi ed into three groups: cancer, not cancer, and early-stage cancer. The multi-layer architecture is utilized to make joint decisions with diff erent machine learning algorithms and remove the limitations of each algorithm so that more accurate decisions can be made. Fourteen feature extraction algorithms that were not previously used in skin cancer images are employed. Inclusion of age, gender, and region of the lesion in the decision-making process in addition to image features also contributes to obtaining better classifi cation results. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using four metrics. The conducted experiments showed that the MLML technique achieved 88.81% accuracy, 88.89% precision, 99.17% recall, and 93.75% F1-score in classifying skin cancer images. Finally, the results were compared with other relevant studies in the literature to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."

In this study, we systematically analyzed the effects of data preprocessing and feature engineering on enhancing the predictive performance of machine learning models for concrete compressive strength estimation. To achieve this, we applied techniques such as data range limitation based on domain knowledge, outlier removal, and feature engineering. Various machine learning algorithms—including neural networks, decision trees, AdaBoost, support vector machines, gradient boosting trees, and extra trees—were employed to predict the compressive strength of concrete. The experimental results demonstrated that the combination of outlier removal and feature engineering, when utilized with the Extra Trees algorithm, achieved the highest predictive performance. Conversely, it was observed that data range limitation should be applied cautiously, as it reduces data diversity and quantity, potentially leading to a decline in model performance. This study underscores the importance of a data-centric approach and is expected to contribute to improving the accuracy and reliability of machine learning-based concrete compressive strength prediction models."

In South Korea, the number of heat-related illnesses has exceeded fatalities from heavy rain and typhoons, showing a growing trend. Thus, proactive measures are urgently needed. This study aimed to predict the number of heat-related illness occurrence using sociodemographic and meteorological factors from 229 districts in South Korea. Data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (2021–2023), including heat-related illness cases, 24 of 35 sociodemographic variables and 32 of 70 meteorological variables, were anlyzed for model development. A prediction model was built using machine learning models (Ridge, Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, LightGBM) to forecast the number of heat-related illnesses per 100,000 people. The XGBoost model (R² = 0.76) showed the highest explanatory power. Sociodemographic factors such as non-urban population (%), apartment housing area (%), nursing medical institutions status, and population over 65 years old (%) were the most important variables contributing to the increased occurrence of heat-related illnesses. Among meteorological variables, variables indicating sustained high temperatures, such as consecutive days with minimum temperature ≥ 25°C and cumulative days with maximum temperature ≥ 29°C, showed higher importance. These results emphasize that the number of heat-related illnesses is influenced not only by social systems and structures, but also by combined effects of vulnerable populations and meteorological factors.

Accordingly, this study targets a large-scale forest fire that ignited in Gangneung and the Donghae, Gangwon-do on March 5, 2022, and was extinguished around 19:00 on March 8, to estimate the fire severity using dNBR and derive environmental factors that affect the grade. As environmental factors, we quantified the regular vegetation index representing vegetation or fuel type, the forest index that classifies tree species, the regular moisture index representing moisture content, and DEM in relation to topography, and then analyzed the correlation with the fire severity. In terms of fire severity, the widest range was 'Unbured' at 52.4%, followed by low severity at 42.9%, medium-low severity at 4.3%, and medium-high severity at 0.4%. Environmental factors showed a negative correlation with dNDVI and dNDWI, and a positive correlation with slope. Regarding vegetation, the differences between coniferous, broad-leaved, and other groups in dNDVI, dNIWI, and slope, which were analyzed to affect the fire severity, were analyzed to be significant with p-value < 2.2e-16. In particular, the difference between coniferous and broad-leaved forests was clear, and it was confirmed that coniferous forest suffered more damage than broad-leaved forest due to the higher fire severity in the Gangwon-do region, including Pinus densiflora, which are dominant species, as well as P. koraiensis, P. rigida and P. thunbergii."
Prediction of Cervical Cancer Patients’ Survival Period with Machine Learning Techniques,2024,"['Machine Learning', 'Data Visualization', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms', 'Survival Rate', 'Disease Attributes']",,"Objectives: The objective of this research is to apply machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the survival of cervical cancer patients. The aim was to address the limitations of traditional statistical methods, which often fail to provide accurate answers due to the complexity of the problem. Methods: This research employed visualization techniques for initial data understanding. Subsequently, ML algorithms were used to develop both classification and regression models for survival prediction. In the classification models, we trained the algorithms to predict the time interval between the initial diagnosis and the patient’s death. The intervals were categorized as “<6 months,” “6 months to 3 years,” “3 years to 5 years,” and “>5 years.” The regression model aimed to predict survival time (in months). We used attribute weights to gain insights into the model, highlighting features with a significant impact on predictions and offering valuable insights into the model’s behavior and decision-making process. Results: The gradient boosting trees algorithm achieved an 81.55% accuracy in the classification model, while the random forest algorithm excelled in the regression model, with a root mean square error of 22.432. Notably, radiation doses around the affected areas significantly influenced survival duration. Conclusions: Machine learning demonstrated the ability to provide high-accuracy predictions of survival periods in both classification and regression problems. This suggests its potential use as a decision-support tool in the process of treatment planning and resource allocation for each patient."
"Enhancing highland ecosystems in East Hararge, Ethiopia: evaluating intervention strategies for species diversity, soil organic carbon stock, and carbon sequestration",2024,"['Land use', 'rehabilitation', 'ecosystem']",,"Forest loss and soil degradation pose significant challenges globally, particularly in developing nations like Ethiopia. Various intervention strategies have been implemented to rehabilitate degraded ecosystems. However, research gaps exist in understanding the most effective approaches, particularly in highland ecosystems. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different intervention strategies on species diversity and carbon stock in the West Hararghe zone, specifically at the Doba district Hades site. The data was collected from 5 February 2022 to 10 December 2022. The study area was characterized by systematic plots and transects to assess vegetation diversity and soil properties across four intervention categories: (physical; only soil and water conservation structures were used, enclosure; only animal and human interaction was restricted, biological; only different tree species were planted, biophysical; both soil water conservation and tree planting were used). Soil samples were collected at different depths, and biomass estimation was conducted using established formulas. Statistical analyses, including one-way ANOVA and post-hoc tests, were performed to test the level of significance. Biophysical interventions exhibited the highest species diversity index (SDI) (4.65 ± 1.21), followed by enclosure interventions (1.68 ± 0.58), while physical interventions recorded the lowest SDI (0.63 ± 0.18). Enclosure interventions led to the highest soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at 40.13 t C ha−1, followed by biophysical interventions at 39.26 t C ha−1.Physical interventions resulted in the lowest SOC stocks at 23.9 t C ha−1, underscoring their potential for carbon sequestration. Biophysical interventions, which include both above-ground and below-ground biomass, showed significant carbon stock accumulation, totaling 173.8 t C ha−1 (39.26 t C ha−1 from SOC and 114.6 t C ha−1 from biomass), highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing ecosystem resilience. Other studies support these findings, underscoring the importance of context-specific approaches and long-term monitoring for sustainable land management. Enclosure and biophysical interventions emerge as promising strategies for enhancing species diversity and soil health, as well as promoting carbon sequestration in highland ecosystems. These findings emphasize the need for informed decision-making and community involvement in ecosystem restoration efforts to achieve meaningful and lasting impacts."

This trend is increasing the proportion of areas suffering from transportation exclusion, marked by reduced mobility and accessibility for residents. To improve the mobility of residents in transportation-excluded areas, a public taxi service is being introduced. For sustainable and efficient transportation services, it is essential to understand demand and supply and develop appropriate service introduction strategies. This study utilizes operational data from public taxis in 32 city and county areas to analyze current operations and characteristics, and proposes operational strategies for service management plans. The findings indicate that the proportion of the elderly population is higher in county areas (31.5%) than in city areas (20.4%), with the highest utilization (10.9%) of the service relative to the beneficiary population in Yecheon County, which has a high elderly population ratio. Additionally, areas with long-distance travel tend to have more single-passenger rides, as users often travel to individual destinations. Using GIS Pro to analyze boarding and alighting points, demand concentration areas, and service zones, it was found that the main boarding and alighting points were residential areas (34%), downtown (18%), and community centers (14%). Some of the demand within identified clusters could not be included within a 5 or 10-minute influence radius from the center, due to geographical features and road structures. Furthermore, most areas showed a pattern of returning at various times after morning peak hours from 8 am to 10 am. Ultimately, based on the analysis, Decision tree model was proposed that categorizes clusters based on three months of demand data and decides on the service operation model for each cluster. Such a practical strategy approach using real data is expected to contribute to the efficient and customized planning and operation of transportation services in excluded areas."

Due the unfriendly environment where the sensors are deployed, there exist many possibilities of malicious nodes which performs malicious activities in the network. Therefore, the security threats affect performance and life time of sensor networks, whereas various security aspects are there to address security issues in WSN namely Cryptography, Trust Management, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). However, IDS detect the malicious activities and produce an alarm.These malicious activities exploit vulnerabilities in the network layer and affect all layers in the network. Existing feature selection methods such as filter-based methods are not considering the redundancy of the selected features and wrapper method has high risk of overfitting the classification of intrusion. Due to overfitting, the classification algorithm fails to detect the intrusion in better manner. The main objective of this paper is to provide the efficient feature selection algorithm which was suitable for any type classification algorithm to detect the intrusion in an effective manner. This paper, the security of the network is addressed by proposing Feature Selection Algorithm using Chi Squared with Ensemble Method (FSChE).

Prediction of RC T-Beams Shear Strength Based on Machine Learning,2024,"['Reinforced concrete T-beams', 'Shear strength', 'Machine learning (ML)', 'Extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost)', 'Decision tree model (DT)', 'Random forest model (RF)']",,"The contribution of shear resisted by flanges of T-beams is usually ignored in the shear design models even though it was proven by many experimental studies that the shear strength of T-beams is higher than that of equivalent rectangular cross-sections. Ignoring such a contribution result in a very conservative and uneconomical design. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate the capability of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the shear capacity of reinforced concrete T-beams (RCTBs) by incorporating the contribution of the flange. Five machine learning (ML) techniques, which are the Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), are trained and tested using 360 sets of data collected from experimental studies. Among the various machine learning models evaluated, the XGBoost model demonstrated exceptional reliability and precision, achieving an R-squared value of 99.10%. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach is utilized to identify the most influential input features affecting the predicted shear capacity of RCTBs. The SHAP results indicate that the shear span-to-depth ratio (a/d) has the most significant effect on the shear capacity of RCTBs, followed by the ratio of shear reinforcement multiplied by the yield strength of shear reinforcement (), flange thickness (), and flange width (). The accuracy of the XGBoost model in predicting the shear capacity of RCTBs is compared with established codes of practice (ACI 318-19, BS 8110-1:1997, EN 1992-1-2, CSA23.3-04) and existing formulas from researchers. This comparison reinforces the superior reliability and accuracy of the machine learning approach compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface platform is developed, effectively simplifying the implementation of the proposed machine-learning model.

The rankings of restau rants located in Jeju Island were used as the dependent variable, and the number of reviews, ratings, quality evaluation, sentiment score of the reviews, foreigners’ review ratio, and the operation periods of restaurants were included as the explanatory variables. Data such as reviews and ratings were collected from Tripadvisor through web crawling using Python, and the sentiment score of the reviews was computed using the VADER package. Results show that the variables that best explain restaurant rankings were the number of reviews and foreigners’ quality evaluations. The higher these values were, the higher the restaurants were ranked.The academic significance of this study is that we collected the information containing online reviews and analyzed its impact on restaurant rankings. This study has the distinct features of adding the sentiment score in the model while inclusively using variables related to online reviews used in existing studies, and compar ing the impact of the review characteristics of Koreans and foreigners on restaurant rankings. This study’s results reveal that online platforms are the key in informing potential visitors and boosting restaurant visi bility, emphasizing the need for review-focused marketing. The number of reviews significantly affects con sumer visiting decisions, suggesting restaurants should strategize to garner more reviews. Furthermore, the quality of evaluations made by foreign tourists impacts restaurant rankings more than those of local tourists’.This underscores the importance of services and marketing specifically aimed at foreigners, especially in regions frequented by them. The implementation of these strategies could attract more tourists and increase competitiveness in these areas."
성경적관점에서의‘진심으로하는용서’(마18:35)의 의미와 그 용서의 과정에 대한 소고,2024,"['마음', '참된 용서', '용서의 과정', '의지적 용서', '감정적 용서', 'heart', 'true forgiveness', 'process of forgiveness', 'decisional forgiveness', 'emotional forgiveness']","사람들은 종종 자신의 원수를 용서하기 위해 치열한 내적 갈등을 하고 있는 사람에게‘진심으로 용서하셨나요?’라는 질문을 던지곤 한다.여기서‘진심으로 하는 용서’는‘참된 용서’와 자주 혼용되어서 쓰이면서 대부분 감정적인 용서를 가리키고 있다. 흥미롭게도 성경 또한 참된용서란‘진심으로 하는 용서’(새번역, 마 18:35)라고 답하고 있다. 여기서‘진심으로 하는 용서’는 원문 그대로‘마음으로부터의 용서’(avfh/te avpo. tw/n kardiw/n)이다. 기독교인들 또한 이‘마음에서 나오는 용서’ 를 가해자에 대한 부정 감정을 해결한 상태로 암묵적으로 이해하고 있다. 특별히 마음을 이성이나 사고의 기관으로 알려진 머리와 반대되는감정적인 부분으로 이해하는 인간의 오랜 전통으로 인해 참된 용서를감정적 용서로 믿는 경향이 있다. 그러나 정말 성경이 말하는‘마음으로부터의 용서’가 감정적인 용서만을 가리키고 있을까? 이에 본 논문은 마태복음 18:35에서 예수님께서 언급하신‘진심으로 하는 용서’란어떤 의미이며, 구체적으로 그 용서가 기독교인에게서 어떤 과정을 거쳐 실현되는지 알아본다. 성경에서 마음은 단지 감정적인 영역만을 관여하는 것이 아니라 영혼의 좌소로서 인간의 모든 심리활동 즉 지적, 도덕적, 의지적, 관계적, 감정적, 영적인 활동의 중심이 되는 곳이다.그렇다면‘마음으로부터 나온 용서’란 지적, 의지적, 관계적, 감정적용서 중에 어떤 것일까? 우리는 그 해답을 마음에 대한 예수님의 관점에서 찾아 볼 수 있다. 예수님의 관점에서는 나무가 자라 열매를 맺듯이, 모든 인간의 행동은 마음에서 자라 밖으로 나온 열매이다(마 5:27- 28; 15:19; 눅 6:43-45). 자라나는 나무처럼 인간의 마음은 정적인 것이 아니라 역동적이며, 마음에서 나오는 한 가지 행동은 일종의 발달과정을 통해 나온다는 것이다. 그 결과 용서라는 열매 또한 일련의 발달단계를 거쳐 마음에서 나오는 선한 행동으로 이해해야 한다. 첫째, 그것은 주로 미숙하고 표면적인 용서인 의지적 용서로서 피해자의 마음에서 시작된다. 둘째, 의지적 용서로 시작된 용서는 점점 인지적이고행동적인 용서를 통해 유지되고 자라야 하는데, 이는 중간 단계이다.셋째, 그것은 완성된 단계의 용서인 감정적 용서로 발달한다. 그러므로마음에서 은밀하게 하는 죄된 생각과 실제적인 죄된 행동을 질적으로동일한 것으로 간주하신 예수님의 관점에서 볼 때 (마 5:28), 의지적 용서나 감정적 용서는 마음에서 나온 질적으로 같은 참된 용서가 된다.단지 차이가 있다면 전자는 미성숙한 용서요, 후자는 성숙한 용서라는양적 차이가 있을 뿐이다.","Jesus asks Christians to offer their offenders “forgiveness from the heart” (Matt 18:35). For Westerners, the heart is usually regarded as the emotional part of humanity, which is opposite to the head, the cognitive part. As a result, usually, when one asks the other whether to have genuinely forgiven his or her offender, it means whether he or she has forgiven the offender emotionally. However, the heart (bl;, kardi,a) in the Bible, the center of a person (Prob 23:7; Jer 31:33; Matt 18:35), includes every aspect of one’s inner life, such as the will (Acts 11:23; Rom 2:5), desire (Ps 37:4; Job 17:11), emotion (Rom 1:24; Heb 10:22), the mind (Prob 14:33; Luke 24:25; Rom 1:21), and one’s conscience (1 John 3:20). Then what is the biblical meaning of true forgiveness from the heart? Is it cognitive, decisional, behavioral, or emotional? We can find answers from Jesus’ view on the human heart. According to Jesus, just as trees produce fruit, all human behaviors are the fruit of the heart, which is the source of all human vices and virtues (Matt 5:27-28; 15:19; Luke 6:43-45). In other words, like a tree, the heart is not static but dynamic, and the behaviors from the heart go through some developmental process. In this respect, John Owen, a Puritan who was well aware of the dynamics of the heart, quoting James 1:14-15, describes that the humans’ heart gives birth to actual sin just as they give birth to babies in the womb (The works of John Owen, 6:194). Therefore, Christian human forgiveness as good fruit growing from the heart should be understood as a process developing in stages. First, it originates from the victim’s heart, mainly as decisional forgiveness, which is immature and quiet. Second, it nurtures to be behavioral forgiveness, which is the intermediate stage. Third, it grows to be verbal and emotional forgiveness, the completed stage. Therefore, just as Jesus equates lustful thoughts with the actual sinful practice of adultery (Matt 5:28), so decisional or behavioral forgiveness is true forgiveness, which is from the heart, though it is an immature and superficial forgiveness without complete forgiving emotions."

In this context, this research investigated factors related to probation compliance attitudes among juveniles with gambling problems. The study focused on conducting empirical analysis with 189 juvenile probationers. The research examined influential factors affecting probation compliance attitudes of adolescents with gambling problems, primarily through the lens of the deterrence model and therapeutic alliance model. Decision Tree Analysis was employed to analyze these influential factors.Analysis of survey data from approximately 189 juvenile probationers, collected between November 1-15, 2022, revealed that 113 subjects had gambling experience. Among these, 87 individuals were classified as high-risk problem gamblers, representing approximately 77% of those with gambling experience. Decision Tree Analysis indicated that the first node related to compliance was the ‘therapeutic alliance model factor’. Furthermore, within the group showing high therapeutic alliance scores, subjects aged 17 and above demonstrated more compliant attitudes toward their probation officers.The findings empirically confirmed that probation officers need to carefully attend to the complex therapeutic needs that delinquent youth had prior to their gambling problems, rather than focusing on strict deterrence-based guidance and supervision. Therefore, to maximize compliance attitudes among juvenile probationers, it is crucial to utilize welfare and treatment-centered intervention strategies in juvenile correctional settings."

METHODS Secondary analysis was conducted using raw data from the 2021 Community Health Survey. after excluding 129 non-responses in the PA domain, a total of 74,363 individuals were included in the final analysis. A total of eight factors, including personal (level of depression, history of falls), relational (relationships with neighbors, living alone), community (satisfaction with the local community system, safety), and environmental factors (living environment, natural environment), were selected in accordance with the key points of social ecological theory. To analyze social ecological factors related to the PA of older adults, we conducted a decision tree analysis using Chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID). RESULTS The average PA level among older adults was approximately 136 minutes, but the mode and median were both 0 minutes. A total of 20.2% of older adults met the physical activity recommendations, while 79.8% did not. According to the first split of the decision tree, living alone was the most relevant factor associated with the PA of older adults, followed by depression and falls. Older adults living alone, with a depression score of 10 or higher, and who had experienced a fall within the past year, were least likely to meet the PA recommendations.CONCLUSIONS This study urgently suggests that PA programs should target older adults living alone, experiencing depression, and falls."

Thus, K-NN, SVM, and Decision Tree were used to be trained. To assess the sensitivity on each algorithm to the scale of the monitoring data, both raw and normalized data sets were run. Additionally, hyperparameters were tuned to derive optimal values for each algorithm’s performance. K-fold cross-validation was employed to prevent overfitting. After tuning, the top 10 models with the highest NSE were evaluated using separate test data that was not involved in the tuning process. This allowed for further validation of the model performance using metrics such as NSE, MSE, RMSE, and MAE. The results indicated that Decision Tree algorithm achieved highest prediction accuracy followed by SVM and K-NN. Decision Tree was particularly well-suited for accurate turbidity prediction relative to other water quality monitoring data. Thus, machine learning techniques could be effectively used for predicting one of the water quality parameters when it will be partially missed or false recorded."

Traditional methods such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) model use clinical factors. This study examined the predictive power of the FRAX score and machine-learning algorithms trained on FRAX parameters.Methods: We analyzed the data of 2,147 female participants from the Ansan cohort study. The FRAX parameters employed in this study included age, sex (female), height and weight, current smoking status, excessive alcohol consumption (>3 units/d of alcohol), and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoporotic fracture was defined as one or more fractures of the hip, spine, or wrist during a 10-year observation period. Machine-learning algorithms, such as gradient boosting, random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression, were employed to predict osteoporotic fractures with a 70:30 training-to-test set ratio. We evaluated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores to assess and compare the performance of these algorithms with the FRAX score.Results: Of the 2,147 participants, 3.5% experienced osteoporotic fractures. Those with fractures were older, shorter in height, and had a higher prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as higher FRAX scores. The AUROC for the FRAX was 0.617. The machine-learning algorithms showed AUROC values of 0.662, 0.652, 0.648, and 0.637 for gradient boosting, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, respectively.Conclusion: This study highlighted the immense potential of machine-learning algorithms to improve osteoporotic fracture risk prediction in women when complete FRAX parameter information is unavailable."

However, their centralized nature often poses challenges when dealing with distributed, decentralized, and private data sources. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a paradigm allowing distributed learning without compromising privacy. Nevertheless, porting ensemble methods like random forests into the federated environment introduces unique challenges, especially in handling non-IID data distributions. This study presents a federated random forest approach that employs a novel ensemble construction method. Rather than growing trees independently in each client, our approach ensures each decision tree in the ensemble is iteratively and collectively constructed across clients. After this, the clients adjust the leaf nodes of each tree, and a global server aggregates these updates across clients. This strategy allows the ensemble to better reflect the data's heterogeneity across different clients, enhancing its performance on non-IID data. Furthermore, we show that the proposed federated random forest method inherently facilitates incremental learning, effectively addressing the dynamic expansion of the federation, which allows the update of the existing ensemble model by seamlessly integrating data from newly participating clients without full retraining. This method maintained high performance with reduced complexity, as our experimental results confirmed."

While prior research has extensively analyzed price determinants focusing on physical attributes and artist reputation, it has largely overlooked the distinct factors relevant to emerging artists. Recent studies have highlighted the potential significance of non-physical attributes, such as artwork titles and descriptions, as novel price determinants. However, empirical validation of the influence of these attributes, particularly in the context of emerging artists, remains scarce. T his study aims to empirically investigate the impact of non-physical attributes on the pricing of artworks by emerging artists. To this end, data were collected from multiple sources, including Art1, the Korea Art Market Information System, and social media platforms. Analytical methods included multiple regression analysis and decision tree regression modeling to identify variables influencing artwork prices. Furthermore, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was employed to provide an in-depth interpretation of the decision tree regression results. The findings reveal that, in addition to traditional factors such as artwork size and artist-related characteristics, non-physical attributes significantly affect the pricing of artworks by emerging artists. Drawing on Dual Coding Theory, which underscores the interplay between linguistic and visual information, this study demonstrates that the linguistic information conveyed through non-physical attributes shapes the visual interpretation and recall of an artwork, ultimately influencing its valuation. These results offer valuable academic insights into the pricing mechanisms of emerging artists’ artworks and propose practical implications for developing strategic pricing approaches within the art market."

Thus, maintaining pulmonary function is crucial for older individuals to live independently. This study aimed to classify the level of pulmonary function in older people based on physical performance and depression.  Method: This study was conducted with community-dwelling older individuals aged 65 years. Pulmonary function was evaluated using a spirometer, and participants were classified into low and normal pulmonary function groups based on the ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1s to forced vital capacity. Physical performance was assessed using the short physical performance battery (SPPB), and depression was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis with 10-fold cross-validation was used to classify pulmonary function using the SPPB, gait speed, and PHQ-9 as variables.  Results: The CART model identified SPPB, gait speed, and PHQ-9 as significant variables for differentiating between the limited and normal pulmonary function groups. The model achieved 76% accuracy, 80% sensitivity, and 70% specificity.  Conclusion: Our findings provide valuable information for screening pulmonary function in older adults and promoting timely strategies to address limited pulmonary function in community and clinical settings. Future research with larger datasets is warranted to validate and improve this model."
FTN-GFDM Detection Based on Reduced-Complexity Soft Sphere Decoding Integrated with Polar Codes,2024,"['multicarrier systems', 'tree search algorithm', 'soft detection', 'non-orthogonal waveform', 'polar coding', 'spectral efficiency']",,"In remote rural areas, it is not possible to employ massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), small cells, and ultra-dense networks (UDNs) with the aim of increasing throughput. A solution is to improve the waveform spectral efficiency, integrating faster than Nyquist (FTN) signaling with generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM). However, this presents high self-interference in the time and frequency domains, requiring dedicated detectors for performance loss mitigation. Hard decision detection schemes primarily designed for MIMO have been adapted to detect FTN-GFDM signals without degradation of the uncoded bit error rate (BER), but these schemes are suboptimal in terms of capacity as they do not provide all the information contained in log-likelihood ratios (LLRs). We design and evaluate in this paper a soft sphere detector (SD) algorithm for FTN-GFDM that can be integrated with state-of-the-art forward error control (FEC) decoders for good BER performance over mobile channels. The SD detector is combined with polar codes, and the BER and complexity are evaluated for different channel models. The results show that FTN-GFDM can provide high spectrum efficiency gains without significant coded BER losses and with affordable complexity on the receiver side, which makes this waveform an interesting candidate for mobile networks in remote areas."

The ventilation uncertainty affects thefactor contributes to uncertainties in fire temperature, subsequently impacting the structural temperature. These temperatures, combined with material properties, give rise to uncertain structural responses. Given the nonlinear behavior of structures under fire conditions, calculating fire fragility traditionally involves time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. To address this, recent studies have explored leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict fire fragility, aiming to enhance efficiency while maintaining accuracy. This study focuses on predicting the fire fragility of a steel moment frame building, accounting for uncertainties in fire size, location, and structural material properties. The fragility curve, derived from nonlinear structural behavior under fire, follows a log-normal distribution.

Multihazard capacity optimization of an NPP using a multi-objective genetic algorithm and sampling-based PSA,2024,"['Multihazard', 'Multi-objective genetic algorithm', 'Probabilistic safety assessment', 'Risk informed decision-making', 'Capacity optimization']",,"After the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami (Japan, 2011), regulatory efforts to mitigate external hazards have increased both the safety requirements and the total capital cost of nuclear power plants (NPPs). In these circumstances, identifying not only disaster robustness but also cost-effective capacity setting of NPPs has become one of the most important tasks for the nuclear power industry. A few studies have been performed to relocate the seismic capacity of NPPs, yet the effects of multiple hazards have not been accounted for in NPP capacity optimization. The major challenges in extending this problem to the multihazard dimension are (1) the high computational costs for both multihazard risk quantification and system-level optimization and (2) the lack of capital cost databases of NPPs. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes an effective method that identifies the optimal multihazard capacity of NPPs using a multi-objective genetic algorithm and the two-stage direct quantification of fault trees using Monte Carlo simulation method, called the two-stage DQFM. Also, a capacity-based indirect capital cost measure is proposed. Such a proposed method enables NPP to achieve safety and cost-effectiveness against multi-hazard simultaneously within the computationally efficient platform. The proposed multihazard capacity optimization framework is demonstrated and tested with an earthquake-tsunami example."

Some of Hwang’s earliest works depict boys’ precarious attempts to preserve their childhood in the realm of absolute beauty in the face of decisive growth, and there is a clear anti-growth logic to them. Originally, Hwang’s representations of children were primarily intended to ‘recapture’ and ‘enjoy’ a preserved childhood, but with the Korean War as a clear turning point, he painted them as objects of containment, protection, and education. In particular, in works such as “Cane”(1956) and Human Grafting(1955~1957), Hwang depicts the moments when primitive moral emotions emerge as children move through childhood and the community of children who faithfully embrace the feelings. As the metaphor of the “intact mirror” and the “vine seed” illustrates, Hwang seeks to bring out the disposition of goodness that children receive from God at birth, based on an essentialism. Since the preservation of the disposition can be jeopardized by worldliness and growth, Hwang Soon-won asks them to grow up in a way that keeps them forever a child. ‘Educational, but resistant to the logic of growth’ is at the core of his bildung ideology.  During the same period, Hwang carefully avoids featuring ‘young men with guns on the battlefield. Still, from around 1956 onward, he talks about young men who killed or nearly killed communists or civilian women. Hwang Soon-won’s code for reenacting the Korean War was ‘atonement,’ and he thought of the Korean War from the perspective that we each did something wrong. The young men who held guns and killed people on the battlefield were the future of children who did not grow up the way Hwang Soon-won wanted them to. This article argues that Trees, Standing on the Slope(1960) is explicitly a narrative of punishment for the “misguided growth” of postwar youth. From this, it becomes clear that Hwang Soon-won was a strange patriarchal figure who sternly reprimanded and punished young men who had become imbued with violent, militaristic masculinity on the battlefield. This narrative of punishment and reprimand, grounded in moral solemnity, frames the Korean War as a matter of freedom by assuming that we could always have made different choices in this forced war."
Efficiency optimization control of permanent magnet synchronous motors for pure electric vehicles based on GBDT,2024,"['Machine learning', 'Permanent magnet synchronous motor', 'Motor efficiency', 'Optimization']",,"In this paper, “Machine learning” is introduced to motor efficiency optimization control to improve the operating efficiency of the permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) for pure electric vehicles. A current distribution method based on the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) is proposed. The efficiency of the motor operation can be improved by coordinating the current control. First, a mathematical model of the motor efficiency is established, and the current distribution law of the optimal efficiency of the motor in different operating regions is qualitatively analyzed. The control system is based on this current distribution. Second, the sample space is established based on measured data, where the current regression model of the GBDT is introduced. Then by analyzing the importance of characteristic variables, the structure of the model is optimized, and the input and output of the model are reasonably selected, which are embedded into the control system to realize the coordinated control of the current. Finally, comparative experiment shows that the proposed method can improve the efficiency of PMSMs in the whole speed range."

For this purpose, artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) models were used, considering previously collected experimental data. Using four machine learning methodologies, we developed a classification learning model that can predict the column failure modes in terms of the input variables using concrete compressive strength, steel yield strength, axial load ratio, height-to-dept aspect ratio, longitudinal reinforcement ratio, and transverse reinforcement ratio. The performance of each machine learning model was compared and verified by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and ROC. Based on the performance measurements of the classification model, the RF model represents the highest average value of the classification model performance measurements among the considered learning methods, and it can conservatively predict the shear failure mode. Thus, the RF model can rapidly predict the column failure modes with simple column details."

Classification of Similarly Colored Medicinal Berries using Hyperspectral Images and Machine Learning Models,2024,"['classification model', 'evaluation metrics', 'logistic regression', 'medicinal plant', 'red fruits']",,"As the misuse of medicinal plants increases due to misclassifications brought about by similarities in the external characteristics (color, size, shape) of plants and their fruits, accurate identification techniques must be developed. Spectral information can be used to identify various characteristics of medicinal plants in wavelength ranges that cannot be seen by the naked eye. This study develops a non-destructive identification and classification technology for medicinal plants using hyperspectral imaging combined with machine learning models to eliminate the misidentification of medicinal berries that are very similar in size, shape, and color. Four models were used to classify different plant species: the logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) models. The optimal classification model was selected based on classification performance indicators. The dried fruit of four medicinal plant species were used: Cornus officinalis, Lycium chinense, Lycium barbarum, and Schisandra chinensis. Hyperspectral images of the samples were obtained corresponding to 150 wavelength bands in the 400–1000 nm range. For the training dataset, the average reflectance spectrum per berry was extracted. The accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the performance of each classification model. The LR model performed best, with accuracy of 0.99 and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 1 for all samples. The LR model produces very accurate results, and the classification system based on it is fast and non-destructive. The machine-learning-based hyperspectral imaging classification system can be applied and scaled up to the industrial level, effectively eliminating the misuse of medicinal plants through accurate identification of these plants."

Compared with the verification dataset, the overall performance of the models indicated that the Random Forest(RF) showed the highest accuracy. The highest performance of the Random Forest(RF) model can be explained by its ability to combine multiple decision trees for a final prediction. Furthermore, the performance based on wildfire severity showed that all machine learning algorithm models had lower detection performance in heat damage areas compared with crown and surface fire areas. Crown and heat damage areas have similar spectral reflectance patterns, and heat damage and surface fire areas are considered to have shown lower performance due to the complex canopy structure. Machine learning based burn severity estimation provide critical baselines for rapid recovery planning and greenhouse gas emissions calculations."

Emphasis was placed on the impact of various baking enhancers on the Mixolab thermo-mechanical properties of wheat flour and consequent alterations in bread texture. The application of baking enhancers positively contributed to dough formation and stability, producing bread with a soft texture. However, a relatively low Pearson correlation coefficient was observed between a single Mixolab parameter and bread texture (r<0.59). To more ac curately predict the texture of bread from the thermo-mechanical features of wheat flour with baking enhancers, five AI models (multiple linear regression, decision tree, stochastic gradient descent, random forest, and multilayer perceptron neural network) were applied, and their prediction performance was compared. The multilayer perceptron neural network model was further utilized to enhance the prediction of bread texture by mitigating overfitting risks. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning (activa tion function [Leaky ReLU], regularization [0.0001], and dropout [0.1]) led to enhanced model performance (R2 = 0.8109 and RMSE = 0.1096)."

This anthropometric data is widely used to diagnose consumer body shapes and develop optimal clothing sizes. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, excels in predicting such body shape classifications. This study seeks to enhance the suitability of clothing design by applying the new analytical methodology of machine learning techniques to better capture and classify the unique body shapes of Korean women.In this study, machine learning techniques such as K-means clustering, Silhouette analysis, and Decision Tree analysis were used to classify the lower body shapes of Korean women in their twenties and identify standard body shapes useful for slacks design. The results showed that the lower body of the age group could be classified into three categories: 'small stature' (the majority), 'tall with an average lower body volume,' and 'medium height with a fuller lower body' (the smallest share). The three-cluster approach is validated through Silhouette analysis, which minimizes misclassification.Decision Tree analysis then further defines the criteria for these clusters, highlighting waist height and hip depth as the most significant factors, achieving a classification accuracy of 90.6%. While this study is not directly related to Robotic Process Automation, its detailed analysis of body shapes for slacks patterns can aid RPA in clothing production.

Investigating and identifying the characteristics of this uncertainty and determining more suitable connection methods are of significant importance for LSP. This study uses original 12 environmental factors data as well as calculated data from five connection methods, namely, probability statistics (PS), frequency ratio (FR), information volume (IV), index of entropy (IOE), and weight of evidence (WOE), as model input variables. Then, four machine learnings logistic regression (LR), Bayesian networks (BN), support vector machines (SVM) and C5.0 Decision Trees (C5.0 DT) are combined with the calculated data and the original data to create 24 unique combinations of connection methods and models. Under these 24 combinations, the uncertainty analysis of LSP modeling is conducted, using Huichang County of China as an example. The analysis entails accuracy assessment, statistical analysis of landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs), distribution patterns of LSIs and sensitivity analysis of the two uncertainty issues. The results show that: 1) LSP accuracies of the FR-, IV- and IOE-based models are comparable, but are lower than those of the WOE-based models, with those of the PS-based models being the worst. WOE has better nonlinear connection performance than the other methods. 2) LSP accuracies of individual models are slightly lower than those of coupled models, but their modeling efficiencies are higher than those of coupled models. 3) The machine learning is more sensitive than the connection method for LSP. In short, WOE-C5.0 DT has the lowest LSP uncertainty while a single machine learning can produce satisfied LSP results with high modelling efficiency."

However, the extent to which HCBs will be stimulated in the future due to increased temperature remains uncertain. This study aims to predict the future occurrence of cyanobacteria in the Nakdong River, which has the highest incidence of HCBs in South Korea, based on temperature rise scenarios. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were used as the basis for these scenarios. Data-driven model simulations were conducted, and out of the four machine learning techniques tested (multiple linear regression, support vector regressor, decision tree, and random forest), the random forest model was selected for its relatively high prediction accuracy. The random forest model was used to predict the occurrence of cyanobacteria. The results of boxplot and time-series analyses showed that under the worst-case scenario (RCP8.5 (2100)), where temperature increases significantly, cyanobacterial abundance across all study areas was greatly stimulated. The study also found that the frequencies of HCB occurrences exceeding certain thresholds (100,000 and 1,000,000 cells/mL) increased under both the best-case scenario (RCP2.6 (2050)) and worst-case scenario (RCP8.5 (2100)). These findings suggest that the frequency of HCB occurrences surpassing a certain threshold level can serve as a useful diagnostic indicator of vulnerability to temperature increases caused by climate change. Additionally, this study highlights that water bodies currently susceptible to HCBs are likely to become even more vulnerable with climate change compared to those that are currently less susceptible."

Reentry Risk and Safety Assessment of Spacecraft Debris Based on Machine Learning,2024,"['Debris distribution', 'Reentry disintegration', 'Machine learning', 'Risk assessment']",,"Uncontrolled spacecraft will disintegrate and generate a large amount of debris in the reentry process. Ablative debris may cause potential risks to the safety of human life and property on the ground. Therefore, predicting the landing points of spacecraft debris and forecasting the degree of risk of waste to human life and property is very important. In view that it is difficult to predict the reentry process and the reentry point in advance, the debris generated from reentry disintegration may cause ground damage for the uncontrolled space vehicle on the expiration of service.

In this study, we utilized state-of-the-art ML-based algorithms, such long short term memory (LSTM), bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), fuzzy inference system (FIS), adaptive neuro FIS (ANFIS), M5 model tree (M5 Tree), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and the powerful ensemble techniques based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), and simple averaging (SA) to aid in improving rice yield prediction more precisely at the ripening stage.Results The fi ndings demonstrate that the ensemble model based on BMA excelled all other models on all evaluation criteria.BMA accomplished the most accurate yield prediction with correlation coeffi cient, root mean squared error (RMSE), normalized RMSE, mean absolute error, median absolute deviation, index of agreement, and a-10 values of 0.958, 0.187 t ha −1 , 0.031, 0.158 t ha −1 , 0.088 t ha −1 , 0.957, and 1.00, respectively.Conclusion Employing a combination of ML algorithms for predicting rice grain yield using UAV-based remote sensing proves to be a powerful and eff ective approach. The ensemble method improves forecast accuracy, mitigates individual algorithm limitations, and produces trustworthy outcomes for smart agricultural decisions by integrating the strengths of multiple algorithms. This comprehensive technique has the potential to adapt rice yield estimation and contribute to sustainable food production systems."

Road Surface Analysis through Machine Learning Techniques,2024,"['GPS based tracking', 'Mobile based application', 'Accelerometer', 'Gyroscope']",,"Roads are an important part of transporting goods and products from one place to another. In developing countries, the main challenge is to maintain road conditions regularly. Roads can deteriorate from time to time. Monitoring the conditions of the roads, which may degrade with time, is very difficult, resulting in a delay in transportation and damage to the vehicles moving on the roads. Poor road conditions cause road accidents. A model is being proposed to monitor the conditions of the road surface by smartphone sensors. Accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS sensors are deployed in the mobile phones, which will help to collect data on the road conditions. After collecting the data about the road conditions, various machine learning approaches, such as supervised, multi-layered, and multiclass, are applied to data filtration. Road conditions are divided into three categories to achieve this methodology: potholes, deep traverse cracks, and smooth roads. This categorization helped in analyzing the road surface condition through smartphone sensors over all three axes instead of taking it over a single axis. Neural networks helped analyze data or road conditions more accurately than Decision Tree and SVM."

원전 구조물의 경년열화를 고려한 지진응답예측 기계학습  모델의 성능평가,2024,"['Nuclear Power Plant Structures', 'Aging deterioration', 'Machine learning', 'Seismic response prediction']",,"Dynamic responses of nuclear power plant structure subjected to earthquake loads should be carefully investigated for safety. Because nuclear power plant structure are usually constructed by material of reinforced concrete, the aging deterioration of R.C. have no small effect on structural behavior of nuclear power plant structure. Therefore, aging deterioration of R.C. nuclear power plant structure should be considered for exact prediction of seismic responses of the structure. In this study, a machine learning model for seismic response prediction of nuclear power plant structure was developed by considering aging deterioration. The OPR-1000 was selected as an example structure for numerical simulation. The OPR-1000 was originally designated as the Korean Standard Nuclear Power Plant (KSNP), and was re-designated as the OPR-1000 in 2005 for foreign sales. 500 artificial ground motions were generated based on site characteristics of Korea. Elastic modulus, damping ratio, poisson’s ratio and density were selected to consider material property variation due to aging deterioration. Six machine learning algorithms such as, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were used t o construct seispic response prediction model. 13 intensity measures and 4 material properties were used input parameters of the training database.

Evaluation of the Current Urgency-Based Lung Allocation System in Korea with Simulation of the Eurotransplant Lung Allocation Score,2024,"['Lung transplant', 'transplant recipients', 'classification']",,"Purpose: Due to the shortage of lung donors relative to the number of patients waiting for lung transplantation (LTx), more than one-third of patients on the waitlist have died without receiving LTx in Korea. Therefore, the importance of fair and effective allocation policies has been emphasized. This study investigated the characteristics of the current urgency-based allocation system in Korea by simulating the Eurotransplant lung allocation score (ET-LAS) using a nationwide multi-institutional registry for LTx in Korea.Materials and Methods: This study used data from the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry (KOTRY), along with additional retrospective data for ET-LAS calculation. A total of 194 patients were included in this study between January 2015 and December 2019. The Korean urgency definition classifies an LTx candidate as having statuses 0–3 according to urgency. The ET-LAS was analyzed according to the Korean urgency status.Results: In total, 92 patients received lung transplants at status 0, 85 at status 1, and 17 at status 2/3. The ET-LAS showed a bimodal distribution with distinct peaks corresponding to status 0 and non-status 0. There was no significant difference in the ET-LAS among non-status 0 patients. In logistic and decision tree analyses, oxygen supplementation methods, particularly oxygen masks and high-flow nasal cannulas, were significantly associated with a high ET-LAS (≥50) among non-status 0 patients.Conclusion: Simulation of the ET-LAS with KOTRY data showed that the Korean urgency definition may not allocate lungs by urgency, especially for patients in non-status 0; therefore, it needs to be revised."

Without appropriate maintenance, the performance of aging structures can deteriorate, diminishing their utility. Predicting the safety performance of these structures with time characteristics is an effective strategy for maintenance planning and can  appropriately pre-determine the duration and cost for their safety performance. This research predicts the safety grade of domestic road facilities including bridges, tunnels, and retaining walls. A database for each facility type was constructed to perform the safety performance evaluations, detailed safety inspections, and precision safety diagnostics. Ordinary bridges, NATM tunnels, and reinforced concrete retaining walls were selected since they are the most common structural types in the database. The safety grade prediction model was developed based on machine learning techniques considering the service life of the structures. Three regression-based machine learning algorithms were used to develop an optimal prediction model: decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).

In this study, GIS-based RUSLE(Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) and SEMMA (Soil Erosion Model for Mountain Areas) were used to evaluate the erosion rate due to vegetation recovery in a small watershed of the Gangneung WUI(Wildland-Urban Interface) fire. The small watershed of WUI fire has a low altitude range of 10-30 m and the average slope of 10.0±7.4° which corresponds to a gentle slope. The soil texture was loamy sand with a high organic content and the deep soil depth. As herbaceous layer regenerated profusely in the gully after the wildfire, the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reached a maximum of 0.55. Simulation results of erosion rates showed that RUSLE ranged from 0.07-94.9 t/ha/storm and SEMMA ranged from 0.24-83.6 t/ha/storm. RUSLE overestimated the average erosion rate by 1.19-1.48 times compared to SEMMA. The erosion rates were estimated to be high in the middle slope where burned pine trees were widely distributed and the slope was steep and to be relatively low in the hollow below the gully where herbaceous layer recovers rapidly. SEMMA showed a rapid increase in erosion sensitivity under at certain vegetation covers with NDVI below 0.25 (Ic = 0.35) on post-fire hillslopes. Gentle slopes with high organic content and rapid recovery of natural vegetation had relatively low erosion rate compared to steep slopes. As subsequent infrastructure and human damages due to sediment disaster by heavy rain is anticipated in WUI fire areas, the research results may be used as basic data for targeted management and decision making on the implementation of emergency treatment after the wildfire."

And we must educate people with courtesy(禮). Punishment is an auxiliary means of governance In a centralized system centered on the king, punishment operates as a means to prevent prohibited acts. If the power of punishment is given priority in the state's administrative actions, it will become a police state. Therefore, Jeong Do-jeon said that punishment should be an assistant to administrative actions, not the center. He also says that in order to complete a good law, there must be trust in those who enforce the law.The purpose of imposing punishment is not to punish crimes, but to ultimately create a world where crime disappears. In other words, the goal is to create a world where criminal law exists but there are no criminals, so punishment is no longer used. Jeong Do-jeon evaluates that punishment is not for killing people, but for saving people. Just as all trees shed their leaves in the fall to prepare for rebirth in the spring, punishment must be given to humans for their survival.Therefore, all criminals must be arrested, and decisions on punishment must be made with caution and caution. It also emphasizes the need to feel pity for criminals(恤刑). Also, when in doubt, it is said that lenient punishment should be given and the sin should be forgiven and given a chance to improve.The main characteristic of Jeong Do-jeon’s view of punishment is that there is social responsibility for crimes. In particular, as seen in the section on thieves, it is questioned whether there is any national responsibility for theft. He said that before punishing thieves, we must first check whether the people's economic lives are stable. This has great implications even today."

However, multilayer perceptron does not reflect contextual information between input variables, so it does not show improvement in prediction performance compared to existing machine learning methods. In this study, in order to overcome the shortcomings of the existing multilayer perceptron methodology, the Transformer methodology, which is mainly used in the natural language processing field, was applied to the problem of personal credit loan default prediction, and as a result, it was confirmed that it showed an improvement in prediction performance compared to the existing deep learning and showed the same level of prediction performance as the XGBoost methodology, an ensemble-based decision tree with the best prediction performance among previous methods. The implication of this study is that the Transformer methodology, which is mainly used in natural language processing, can be effective in the problem of predicting personal credit loan defaults using tabular data consisting of various variables. This suggests that, compared to existing traditional modeling techniques, Transformer can better capture complex interactions between high-dimensional data and improve prediction performance. This shows that the Transformer model has the potential to expand its application range in various prediction problems in the financial field."
전통 통계분석기법과 머신러닝을 활용한 대졸자의 진로상태 분류 예측모델 비교분석,2024,"['대졸', '머신러닝', '예측모델', '분류예측모델', '한국교육종단연구.', 'Career Status', 'College Graduates’ Career', 'Machine Learning', 'Prediction Model', 'Classification Model.']","이 연구는 급변하는 현대사회에 개인들의 끊임없는 진로선택과 결정에 있어 개별 맞춤형 방향성을 제시해주고, 대학 측면에서는 필요 인재 확보에 대한 가이드라인 제공과 대학 수요자들의 취업 및 진로 개발 지원에 정확한 진로방향 예측을 통해 질적 향상을 모색함으로써 대학의 미래 경쟁력 제고에 기여 하고자 하는 현실적인 필요성에서 출발하였다. 이를 위해 대졸자의 진로상태 분류 예측모델을 개발하 고, 주요 예측변인의 특징을 분석함으로써 청년의 진로상태에 가장 중요하게 작용하는 요인이 무엇인 지 알아보는 것으로 연구목적을 설정하였다. 연구목적에 따라 먼저 집단을 학력을 기준으로 구직 및 취업자, 대학원 진학자로 나누었다. 다음으 로 그들의 진로상태를 분류하는 예측모델 구현을 통해 어떠한 변인들이 대졸자의 진로상태 예측에 영 향을 미치는지 알아보기 위해 로지스틱 회귀분석과 판별분석을 활용하여 전통적 통계기법 예측모델을 구현하였다. 마찬가지로 머신러닝 예측모델을 구현하기 위해 의사결정나무, 서포트벡터머신, 랜덤포레 스트, XGboost 알고리즘을 활용하였다. 분석결과 구현된 모델 중에서 서포트벡터머신 예측모델이 82.12%의 예측률로 가장 뛰어난 것으로 나타나 서포트벡터머신 알고리즘으로 구현한 예측모델을 최종 예측모델로 결정하였다. 결정된 최종 모 델에서 대졸 후 진로상태를 예측하는 주요 요인은 개인 특성요인이었다. 더불어 개인 환경요인 중에서 도 사회적 자본에 해당하는 변인들이 모든 머신러닝 예측모델에서도 최상위 예측변인으로 도출되었던 만큼 대졸자의 진로에 있어 사회적 자본에 대한 중요성이 재차 검증될 필요가 있다. 해당 예측모델을 실무적인 측면에서 활용한다면 누가 대학 또는 대학원에 진학할 확률이 높은지 예 측할 수 있다. 따라서 이들을 대상으로 상위 교육기관 진학과 관련한 맞춤형 가이드라인을 설계하는 데 도움이 될 수 있다. 뿐만 아니라, 대학생 중에서 진로결정 상태가 아닌 학생들에게 해당 예측모형을 활 용한다면 이들의 진로상태를 예측할 수 있고, 이를 바탕으로 예상되는 졸업 후 진로에 대한 설명 및 조 언 등 맞춤형 진로 설계 가이드라인을 제시해줄 수 있을 것이다.","The study focused on developing a predictive model for classifying college graduates’ career status and finding out which factors affect most importantly the young adults’ career status by analyzing the characteristics of major predictive factors. Based on the purpose of the study, the group was divided into two groups(g1: job seekers or the employed, g2: graduate students) in accordance with the characteristics of the data. Next, to find out which variables affect the prediction of college graduates’ career status through creating a prediction model, not only were classic statistical models created using logistic regression and discriminant analysis, but machine learning models were also made using the Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random forest, and XGboost algorithms. In a consequence of the analysis, the SVM prediction models turned out to be the best prediction rates(82.12%). Therefore, the final predictive model was decided to SVM model, and it was analyzed to the main predictive variables from the SVM model. Thus, the top predictive variable was the number of people who could call for the help belonging to personal environmental factors. It means personal feature factors were the key factors predicting college graduates’ career status. Therefore, it is necessary to examine how personal feature factors(intelligence, values, competencies) affect their careers. Furthermore, the importance of social relationships in college graduates’ careers needs to be reexamined as social relationships were the key factors in all the machine learning models."
