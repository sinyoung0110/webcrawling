k-NN과 ANN 을 이용한 열적 열화된 복합재료의 연면절연내력 예측,2024,"['Flashover Voltage', 'Degradation', 'Machine Learning', 'Artificial Neural Network', 'K-Nearest Neighbors']",,"In this study, the effectiveness and performance of machine learning approaches for predicting surface flashover voltage of thermally stressed specimen were studied. In particular, k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) technique were considered. Data from flashover experiments and features of the electrical field distribution were used to train the machine learning models. The overall process of implementing the prediction model is introduced. While both approaches were optimized through hyperparameter tuning, it was shown that the ANN approach shows slightly better prediction performance. In particular, ANN seemed to show satisfactory performance for specimen that experienced higher stress conditions. Although the k-NN approach showed some limitations compared to the ANN approach, the k-NN approach could also show potential for applications thanks to its rather simple approach and requiring less computation resources."

In this paper, we present a fire detection system based on a K-NN classification model using a multi-sensor based fire detector. Also, by constructing a mesh network for fire detection, detectors within a spatial range can be interlinked to detect fire. Looking at the performance evaluation results of the implemented system, it was confirmed that the TPR(True Positive Rate) of fire classification was 96.1%, the FPR(False Positive Rate) was 0%, and the F1-Score, which corresponds to the harmonized mean value of accuracy and reproduction rate of fire and non-fire classification, was 98.01%, and the prediction accuracy ACC(Accuracy) showed excellent performance of 98.05%.

Utilizing Data Mining Techniques to Predict Students Performance using Data Log from MOODLE,2024,"['Educational Data Mining', 'Student Performance', 'Moodle', 'ML techniques', 'NN techniques.']",,"Due to COVID19 pandemic, most of educational institutions and schools changed the traditional way of teaching to online teaching and learning using well-known Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, etc. Accordingly, LMS started to generate a large data related to students’ characteristics and achievements and other course-related information. This makes it difficult to teachers to monitor students’ behaviour and performance. Therefore, a need to support teachers with a tool alerting student who might be in risk based on their recorded activities and achievements in adopted LMS in the school. This paper focuses on the benefits of using recorded data in LMS platforms, specifically Moodle, to predict students' performance by analysing their behavioural data and engagement activities using data mining techniques.

Different machine learning techniques, including k-NN, TREE, Ensembled Tree, SVM, and MLPNNs were applied to the processed data. The results showed that the MLPNNs technique outperformed other classification techniques, achieving a classification accuracy of 93%, while SVM and k-NN achieved 90% and 87% respectively. This indicates the possibility for future research to investigate incorporating other neural network methods for categorizing students using data from LMS."

Thus, K-NN, SVM, and Decision Tree were used to be trained. To assess the sensitivity on each algorithm to the scale of the monitoring data, both raw and normalized data sets were run. Additionally, hyperparameters were tuned to derive optimal values for each algorithm’s performance. K-fold cross-validation was employed to prevent overfitting. After tuning, the top 10 models with the highest NSE were evaluated using separate test data that was not involved in the tuning process. This allowed for further validation of the model performance using metrics such as NSE, MSE, RMSE, and MAE. The results indicated that Decision Tree algorithm achieved highest prediction accuracy followed by SVM and K-NN.

공간보간법 기반 선량평가 시 측정값 분포 및 개수별 평가 결과 분석,2024,"['Nuclear power plants', 'Spatial interpolation method', 'Dose assessment', 'Emergency workers', 'Distribution and Number of measurements']",,"In the emergency situation at nuclear power plant, the radiation dose levels of emergency workersshould be analyzed to optimize their radiation levels. However, analyzing the dose level of workers can be difficultdue to the lack of dose rate information in some workspaces. In such cases, spatial interpolation can be used to quicklyperform a dose assessment using only relatively easy-to-obtain measurement data. However, spatial interpolation canproduce different interpolation results depending on the distribution and number of the measurements. The purposeof this study is to analyze the evaluation results of spatial interpolation method by the distribution and number ofmeasurement data. For this purpose, K-NN, IDW, and Kriging interpolation methods were analyzed, and a simulatedworkspace and distribution and number of the measurement data for dose assessment were set up. For the distributionof the measurement data, three situations were set: 1) distribution over the entire workspace, 2) distribution in thehigh dose rate area, and 3) distribution in the low dose rate area. The number of measurements was set to 8, 35, and96. The radiation dose rates were evaluated by the distribution and number of the measurement data for each spatialinterpolation method and the results were compared with the evaluation results of the MCNP computer code. Theresults showed that when measurements are distributed over the entire workspace, K-NN method showed the lowesterror rate within 5.00% for 35 and 96 measurements. For 8 measurements, Kriging method showed lowest error rate,but it was similar to K-NN. When measurements are distributed in the high dose rate area, Kriging method showedan error rate of more than 100% when there were 8 measurements, but as the number of measurements increased,the error rate decreased to between 16.2% and 30.4%, the lowest error rate of the three interpolation methods.When measurements are distributed in the low dose rate area, Kriging interpolation showed a relatively high errorrate compared to the other two interpolation methods when there were 8 measurements. However, as the numberof measurements increased, the error rate decreased sharply and was less than 5.00%, the lowest error rate of thethree interpolation methods. The results of this study are expected to be used as a basis for emergency worker doseassessment based on the spatial interpolation method."
Machine Learning Using Template-Based-Predicted Structure of Haemagglutinin Predicts Pathogenicity of Avian Influenza,2024,"['Convolutional neural network', 'principal component analysis', 'abnormality detection', 'machine learning', 'avian influenza', 'haemagglutinin']",,"Deep learning presents a promising approach to complex biological classifications, contingent upon the availability of well-curated datasets. This study addresses the challenge of analyzing threedimensional protein structures by introducing a novel pipeline that utilizes open-source tools to convert protein structures into a format amenable to computational analysis. Applying a twodimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to a dataset of 12,143 avian influenza virus genomes from 64 countries, encompassing 119 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) types, we achieved significant classification accuracy. The pathogenicity was determined based on the presence of H5 or H7 subtypes, and our models, ranging from zero to six mid-layers, indicated that a four-layer model most effectively identified highly pathogenic strains, with accuracies over 0.9.To enhance our approach, we incorporated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and one-class SVM for abnormality detection, improving model robustness through bootstrapping. Furthermore, the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) algorithm was fine-tuned via hyperparameter optimization to corroborate the findings. The PCA identified distinct clustering for pathogenic HA, yielding an AUC of up to 0.85. The optimized K-NN model demonstrated an impressive accuracy between 0.96 and 0.97. These combined methodologies underscore our deep learning framework's capacity for rapid and precise identification of pathogenic avian influenza strains, thus providing a critical tool for managing global avian influenza threats."

Therefore, this study proposes a method to recognize the human activity for applicable to low-cost embedded systems. The proposed method calculates the average velocity and the zero-crossing ratio using a three-axis acceleration sensor and then images, and it is recognized the human activity pattern using these images and LBP. In the performance evaluation, it is confirmed that the recognition rate of 91.8% and the computation time are small. Therefore, it is very effective if the proposed algorithm is applied to the low cost embedded system."

This study explores the optimal machine learning algorithm by comparing the performance of various algorithms using data on college students’ dropout risks. Methods : We collected data on factors influencing dropout risk and propensity were collected from N University. The collected data were applied to several machine learning algorithms, including random forest, decision tree, artificial neural network, logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification, and Naive Bayes. The performance of these models was compared and evaluated, with a focus on predictive validity and the identification of significant dropout factors through the information gain index of machine learning.

The results showed that the relative importance of the predictor variables was highest for department, age, grade, and residence, in the order of whether or not they matched the school location.  Conclusion : Machine learning-based prediction of dropout risk focuses on the early identification of students at risk. The types and causes of dropout crises vary significantly among students. It is important to identify the types and causes of dropout crises so that appropriate actions and support can be taken to remove risk factors and increase protective factors. The relative importance of the factors affecting dropout risk found in this study will help guide educational prescriptions for preventing college student dropout."
근육 활성화 모델 기반의 데이터 증강을 활용한 동시 동작 인식 프레임워크,2024,"['Simultaneous Motion', 'Data Augmentation', 'Muscle Activation Model', 'Classification Accuracy']",,"Simultaneous motion is essential in the activities of daily living (ADL). For motion intention recognition, surface electromyogram (sEMG) and corresponding motion label is necessary. However, this process is time-consuming and it may increase the burden of the user. Therefore, we propose a simultaneous motion recognition framework using data augmentation based on muscle activation model. The model consists of multiple point sources to be optimized while the number of point sources and their initial parameters are automatically determined. From the experimental results, it is shown that the framework has generated the data which are similar to the real one. This aspect is quantified with the following two metrics: structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE). Furthermore, with k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) or support vector machine (SVM), the classification accuracy is also enhanced with the proposed framework. From these results, it can be concluded that the generalization property of the training data is enhanced and the classification accuracy is increased accordingly. We expect that this framework reduces the burden of the user from the excessive and time-consuming data acquisition."
주성분 분석을 활용한 적응형 근전도 패턴 인식 알고리즘,2024,"['Pattern Recognition', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Adaptive Process', 'Classification Accuracy']",,"Pattern recognition for surface electromyogram (sEMG) suffers from its nonstationary and stochastic property. Although it can be relieved by acquiring new training data, it is not only timeconsuming and burdensome process but also hard to set the standard when the data acquisition should be held. Therefore, we propose an adaptive sEMG pattern recognition algorithm using principal component analysis. The proposed algorithm finds the relationship between sEMG channels and extracts the optimal principal component. Based on the relative distance, the proposed algorithm determines whether to update the existing patterns or to register the new pattern. From the experimental result, it is shown that multiple patterns are generated from the sEMG data stream and they are highly related to the motion. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has shown higher classification accuracy than k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and support vector machine (SVM). We expect that the proposed algorithm is utilized for adaptive and long-lasting pattern recognition."
시간 접두어를 활용한 트라이 기반 IoT 데이터 인덱싱 기법,2024,"['IoT 센서 데이터', 'S2', '이진 트라이', '시간 접두사', 'TS-트라이', 'IoT sensor data', 'S2', 'binary trie', 'temporal prefixes', 'TS-trie']",,"As Internet of Things technology becomes more widespread, various techniques have been proposed to efficiently retrieve large amounts of IoT sensor data. One of the state-of-the-art techniques, ST-Trie, has been shown to have inferior query processing performance compared to other composite indexing techniques for queries with a narrow time range of less than 1 day. To address this concern, this paper proposes TS-Trie, a trie-based indexing technique using temporal prefixes. TS-Trie uses 20-bit temporal information as a prefix to convert threedimensional spatiotemporal information into 64-bit one-dimensional key values. It also improves the existing search method by building a double-linked list of nodes after 20 bits. By applying the proposed TS-Trie to three real-world IoT datasets, we measured the performance of processing range queries, k-NN, and Top-k queries. As a result, TS-Trie could on average shorten the query time by about 50%, 40%, and 60%, compared to the existing methods, on the three datasets, respectively. With a high compression ratio of 86%, we further confirmed TS-excellent Trie's space efficiency and showed an average indexing speed that was around four times faster than previous techniques."
CNN과 진동데이터를 활용한 산업용 로봇의 고장 진단,2024,"['Industrial Robot', 'Vibration Sensor', 'Deep Learning', 'Fault Diagnosis', 'CNN']",,"Products were typically produced using specialized equipment such as CNC machines, milling machines, and lathes in traditional manufacturing. However, modern manufacturing is increasingly attempting with technological advancements to leverage large industrial robots for machining, offering greater flexibility, efficiency, and a high degree of freedom throughout the entire production process. Additionally, the demand for industrial robots continues to rise as industries adopt smart factories. These robots are becoming larger, more precise, and faster, as they take over tasks previously requiring specialized equipment or skilled human operators. Where numerous robots are in operation in factories, ensuring a stable supply chain and maintaining operational uptime is crucial. Therefore, preparing for potential mechanical failures in each robot is necessary, and there is a growing need for technologies that enable real-time fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance. A large industrial robot used for machining was employed as a testbed for fault diagnosis in this study. The Vibration data was collected from various robot axes under both normal operating conditions and abnormal conditions, such as end-effector overloads and drive malfunctions. The collected vibration data was then preprocessed, and key features were analyzed and extracted. The extracted features were used to build a learning model, and in this study, the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm was applied instead of k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) to diagnose defects occurring in the discontinuous movements of the robot, thereby improving accuracy."
