This analysis is particularly relevant given the growing emphasis on learner identity in global education. First, to predict the self-management capabilities of these students, eight machine learning regression models—Linear Regression, SVR, KNN, GBM, Bagging Regressor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost—were compared. XGBoost was identified as the most effective model, demonstrating low errors and high explanatory power. Next, the selected XGBoost model was applied to analyze the importance of variables in predicting self-management competency, using the Gain value as the evaluation criterion. It was analyzed that ‘setting a goal (meta-cognition) and studying while thinking about that goal’, ‘(attitude to work) even if it is difficult, I will choose what I like’, and ‘(meta-cognition) I can find and do what I need or task’ are relatively important variables compared to other variables. Additionally, a partial dependence plot was generated to examine the correlation between explanatory variables and response variables. It can be inferred that higher levels of metacognition and a more positive attitude toward work are associated with greater self-management abilities among general high school students."

While existing studies have primarily focused on predicting the onset of go-arounds, relatively little attention has been paid to evaluating aircraft stability and performance after a go-around has been initiated. This study aims to address this gap by systematically assessing the dynamic response and stability of aircraft following a go-around using Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. The methodology involves classifying go-around events into 'near-ground' and 'at-altitude' categories, and analyzing changes in pitch, descent rate, engine performance, and environmental factors after the initiation of the go-around to evaluate its stability and efficiency. The XGBoost machine learning algorithm is employed to model the aircraft’s response post go-around and to predict stability across various go-around scenarios.

"sEMG 신호를 이용한 Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost 기반 팔꿈치 각도 분류 성능 비교",2024,"['sEMG', 'Random Forest', 'SVM', 'XGBoost', 'Classification']",,"This study aimed to develop a machine learning model for classifying elbow angles using sEMG signals. Previous research in rehabilitation and robotic arm control has often combined sEMG and IMU sensors to measure muscle activity and precise angles. However, in rehabilitation, utilizing sEMG signals alone may be more practical than using multiple sensors. The use of sensors like IMUs increases equipment costs and complicates data pro- cessing, making interpretation more challenging. In contrast, sEMG signals reflect muscle activation and can predict angles simply and effectively, making them suitable for assessing elbow movements. This study classified elbow flex- ion and extension angles into 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90° using only sEMG sensors. sEMG data were collected from the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles and analyzed using Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost models to eval- uate angle classification performance. The experimental results showed high accuracy for all three models, with SVM and XGBoost demonstrating particularly superior performance. These findings suggest that sEMG signals alone can effectively predict elbow angles in applications such as rehabilitation and arm control, providing a valuable tool for assessing and aiding recovery of motor functions in rehabilitation therapy."

We began by judiciously defining key features including the weekly average purchase amount and variance in purchase amount. Subsequently, we evaluated the proposed method’s performance, finding the predicted future purchase amounts to match the actual purchase amounts. A key strength of this study was the interpretability of feature variables. Through the feature importance score from XGBoost, we found that features that capture impulsive patterns in purchases (e.g., variability in purchase amount) are strongly correlated with future spending, which agrees with conventional behavior analysis. Our study can be extended to the development of early warning systems designed to identify at-risk and potentially addicted purchasers on online lottery platforms."

Currently, the forest vertical structure is predominantly assessed via an in-situ method, which is not only difficult to apply to inaccessible locations or large areas but also costly and requires substantial human resources. Therefore, mapping systems based on remote sensing data have been actively explored. Recently, research on analyzing and classifying images using machine learning techniques has been actively conducted and applied to map the vertical structure of forests accurately. In this study, Sentinel-2 and digital surface model images were obtained on two different dates separated by approximately one month, and the spectral index and tree height maps were generated separately. Furthermore, according to the acquisition time, the input data were separated into cases 1 and 2, which were then combined to generate case 3. Using these data, forest vetical structure mapping models based on random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boost(XGBoost)were generated. Consequently, nine models were generated, with the XGBoost model in Case 3 performing the best, with an average precision of 0.99 and an F1 score of 0.91.

The subjects of this study collected and analyzed data on the number of spectators during the 2018-2019 season before COVID-19, the 2020-2021 season affected by COVID-19, and the 2022 season after COVID-19. The main conclusions from the derived research results are as follows. First, as the number of local infected people increased, the crowd mobilization was affected. In particular, in the metropolitan area, the number of spectators decreased as the number of COVID-19 infected increased compared to the non-metropolitan area. Second, the change in the crowd mobilization rate due to the quarantine rules had a significant difference in the 2020 season, but in the 2021 season, even if the mobilization rate increased, the increase in spectators did not appear due to the spread of COVID-19. Third, when the analysis was conducted using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and the XGBoost model to predict changes in the number of spectators, it was confirmed that XGBoost performed better than the OLS model, and it was found that the number of spectators was predicted with higher accuracy than the OLS model."

Predicting water level is very difficult because the water level changes are large. For water level prediction using unstructured time series data, including water level data, upstream dam data, and climate data, derivative variables were generated by using STL decomposition, difference, and time encoding. In addition, the variables of the input data were reduced using only data from the upstream region having the greatest correlation with the target water level. Among the XGBoost, SVR, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM architectures, XGBoost was derived as the most suitable algorithm for river data in the Seom Jin River basin. The learning method by weighting about a year and a half of the latest data predicted the surge pattern of the water level more accurately than the conventional method. The machine learning model had an accuracy of 97.781%, showing a performance superior to the deep learning model in this study.

Extensive research has been conducted to anticipate accidents preemptively. While previous studies have significantly enhanced the performance of predictive models for traffic accidents, challenges persist due to the complex interplay of various factors such as human, roadway, and socio-economic elements, leading to unobserved heterogeneity and limitations in linear assumptions of statistical models. Additionally, categorical variable modeling remains a significant obstacle in accident modeling. Therefore, this study aims to address the unobserved heterogeneity by employing a Mixed Effects Boosting model, which combines mixed effects modeling to alleviate linearity assumptions and a Boosting algorithm for categorical variable modeling. This approach aids in predicting traffic accidents. Moreover, to overcome the ""Black box"" issue inherent in machine learning models, surrogate models (SHAP) are utilized to analyze accident factors from both global and local perspectives, providing insights into regional accident response strategies."

However, research on the differences between the dimensionality reduction rate and model prediction performance is still lacking for building energy-related data. Therefore, this study compared the dimensionality reduction rate and model prediction performance by handling missing values in weather information datasets, which is related to building energy. The missing value-handling methods were divided into removal, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation, and no handling. Dimensionality reduction methods were classified based on principal component analysis and feature selection using the model. Further, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, a gradient boosting method with its own missing data handling capabilities, was used. Consequently, few principal components were required to explain 95% of the variance in the raw data when the missing values were removed than when they were replaced with KNN. Moreover, the dimensionality reduction methods of model building and feature selection outperformed principal component analysis in terms of dimensionality reduction rate and model predictive accuracy. Particularly, the XGBoost model without missing values had the highest accuracy, suggesting that the missing-value handling method of XGBoost may be superior to conventional missing-value handling methods. These results may have important implications for selecting imputation methods in building energy data analysis, considering the effort and cost of missing value handling, and can significantly reduce the cost and effort of data preprocessing."
Selecting Optimal Algorithms for Stroke Prediction: Machine LearningBased Approach,2024,"['Stroke prediction', 'Machine learning', 'KNHANES', 'XGBoost']",,"In this paper, we compare three models (logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) for predicting stroke occurrence using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). We evaluated these models using various metrics, focusing mainly on recall and F1 score to assess their performance. Initially, the logistic regression model showed a satisfactory recall score among the three models; however, it was excluded from further consideration because it did not meet the F1 score threshold, which was set at a minimum of 0.5. The F1 score is crucial as it considers both precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a model's accuracy. Among the models that met the criteria, XGBoost showed the highest recall rate and showed excellent performance in stroke prediction. In particular, XGBoost shows strong performance not only in recall, but also in F1 score and AUC, so it should be considered the optimal algorithm for predicting stroke occurrence. This study determines that the performance of XGBoost is optimal in the field of stroke prediction."

Prediction of RC T-Beams Shear Strength Based on Machine Learning,2024,"['Reinforced concrete T-beams', 'Shear strength', 'Machine learning (ML)', 'Extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost)', 'Decision tree model (DT)', 'Random forest model (RF)']",,"The contribution of shear resisted by flanges of T-beams is usually ignored in the shear design models even though it was proven by many experimental studies that the shear strength of T-beams is higher than that of equivalent rectangular cross-sections. Ignoring such a contribution result in a very conservative and uneconomical design. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate the capability of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the shear capacity of reinforced concrete T-beams (RCTBs) by incorporating the contribution of the flange. Five machine learning (ML) techniques, which are the Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), are trained and tested using 360 sets of data collected from experimental studies. Among the various machine learning models evaluated, the XGBoost model demonstrated exceptional reliability and precision, achieving an R-squared value of 99.10%. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach is utilized to identify the most influential input features affecting the predicted shear capacity of RCTBs. The SHAP results indicate that the shear span-to-depth ratio (a/d) has the most significant effect on the shear capacity of RCTBs, followed by the ratio of shear reinforcement multiplied by the yield strength of shear reinforcement (), flange thickness (), and flange width (). The accuracy of the XGBoost model in predicting the shear capacity of RCTBs is compared with established codes of practice (ACI 318-19, BS 8110-1:1997, EN 1992-1-2, CSA23.3-04) and existing formulas from researchers. This comparison reinforces the superior reliability and accuracy of the machine learning approach compared to traditional methods.

The model was designed to simplify the classification process compared to conventional methods.Methods: We retrospectively collected data from patients with cholangitis who visited the emergency department of a secondary medical institution in Seongnam, Korea from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019. The patients were divided into three groups (Grade I, II, III) based on severity according to the Tokyo Guidelines 2018/2013 (TG18/13) severity assessment criteria for cholangitis. We used algorithms to select variables of high relevance associated with the grade of severity. For the XGBoost models, data were divided into a train set and a validation set by the random split method. The train set was trained in XGBoost models using only the top seven variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) were obtained from the validation set.Results: 796 patients were enrolled. The top 7 variables associated with the grade of severity were albumin, white blood cells, blood urea nitrogen, troponin T, platelets, creatinine, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. The AUROC values were 0.881 (Grade I), 0.836 (Grade II), and 0.932 (Grade III). The AUPRC values were 0.457 (Grade I), 0.820 (Grade II), and 0.880 (Grade III).Conclusion: We believe that the developed XGBoost model is a useful tool for predicting the severity of acute cholangitis with high accuracy and fewer variables than the conventional severity classification method."

In baseball, there is an award called the “Golden Glove” given to the best player in each position. The selection of the Golden Glove winners is based on votes from media personnel such as reporters, broadcast PDs, and commentators, making it difficult to establish clear criteria and important variables for each position. Therefore, the aim of this study is to design a predictive model for the Golden Glove winners based on the statistics of candidates and winners from the Korean professional baseball league between 2003 and 2022, using logistic regression analysis and machine learning techniques. The study also compares and analyzes the performance of the designed predictive models to identify the most suitable model for predicting the Golden Glove winners. The models include logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and XGBoost, with hyperparameters specified for each model. Z-scores, which standardize values, and min-max normalization, which scales values, were used to present the models in two different forms. After optimizing variables, the performance of each model was evaluated.<BR/>  First, in designing the Korean professional baseball Golden Glove prediction model, the logistic regression model used L1, L2, and elasticnet as kernels, the support vector machine model used rbf and poly as kernels, and no significant variables were identified in the nonlinear models. The random forest model used gini and entropy as criteria, and the XGBoost model used exact, approx, and hist as criteria. To increase the F1 score, variables were removed one by one, and the selected variables for each position differed between models.<BR/>  Second, the comparison of the machine learning prediction models revealed that although there were differences in performance across positions, the support vector machine model 2 and XGBoost model showed high prediction accuracy and F1 scores, while the logistic regression and random forest models showed relatively lower accuracy and F1 scores. Overall, the models that were standardized using min-max (model 2) demonstrated better prediction abilities than those standardized using z-scoring (model 1).<BR/>  Therefore, to predict the Golden Glove winners, it is advisable to use the XGBoost model 2 with min-max normalization, and it is believed that including defensive statistics in future models will yield even better results."

Our primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative information in predicting the delinquency of loan applicants. This assessment involved comparative analyses between scores generated from alternative data sources and credit scores established by credit bureaus.This study has explored the largest number of alternative information sources among domestic empirical studies. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on the usefulness of alternative information as a complementary factor to credit information, this study has demonstrated that alternative information alone can also provide excellent performance when a diverse range of alternative information is used.The model we developed produced an alternative score with higher predictive power, achieving an AUC of 87%, compared to the standard credit scores from credit bureaus, which had AUCs of 84% and 82% respectively. This demonstrates that the alternative score not only outperforms standard credit scores but also exhibits a high level of robustness.A key finding of our research is that by utilizing a sufficient amount of alternative data, it is possible to achieve higher predictive accuracy than standard credit scores, even without relying on demographic variables. This enables a fairer evaluation of loan applicants, particularly for financially marginalized groups such as non-salaried workers and younger individuals who lack traditional credit histories.Furthermore, contrary to concerns that the utilization of alternative data in credit scoring may exacerbate social stratification, this study demonstrates that alternative data can provide significant benefits to those who have been disadvantaged by the traditional credit scoring system, which has primarily focused on salaried individuals and may have led to conservative evaluations for other groups. This suggests that alternative data not only enhances the accuracy of credit evaluations but also increases financial inclusion.Additionally, our research underscores the importance of adhering to data privacy regulations when utilizing alternative information, as the use of alternative data becomes more prevalent in credit scoring.Overall, this study highlights the potential of alternative data to improve the credit scoring system by enhancing accuracy and inclusivity. The findings suggest that integrating alternative information into credit evaluation models can provide considerable benefits, both in terms of predictive performance and in promoting financial inclusion for underserved populations, especially thin-filers."

In addition, by using the XAI approach, we provide visualized interpretations for the prediction results from the XGBoost model. The analysis further reveals that the return on sales and the selling, general and administrative costs are the most impactful variables for predicting zombie firms.

The genomic prediction was conducted with the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) method using the BLUPF90 program. The accuracy of prediction was computed in three different types, namely, Empirical all SNPs, Empirical QTL, and theoretical accuracy, Accuracy PEV . Among the three models, the highest Empirical all SNPs accuracy 0.79 was derived for GBM followed by 0.77 for XGBoost and 0.76 for GWAS. The Empirical QTL accuracy was almost equal for all three models. The maximum theoretical accuracy was obtained for GWAS which was 0.93, whereas GBM and XGBoost obtained 0.86 and 0.85 accuracy levels respectively. Our results indicate that all three models comparably performed in genomic predictions; however, subsets selected by both GBM and GWAS reported higher prediction accuracies compared to the whole SNP set.

Without appropriate maintenance, the performance of aging structures can deteriorate, diminishing their utility. Predicting the safety performance of these structures with time characteristics is an effective strategy for maintenance planning and can  appropriately pre-determine the duration and cost for their safety performance. This research predicts the safety grade of domestic road facilities including bridges, tunnels, and retaining walls. A database for each facility type was constructed to perform the safety performance evaluations, detailed safety inspections, and precision safety diagnostics. Ordinary bridges, NATM tunnels, and reinforced concrete retaining walls were selected since they are the most common structural types in the database. The safety grade prediction model was developed based on machine learning techniques considering the service life of the structures. Three regression-based machine learning algorithms were used to develop an optimal prediction model: decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The accuracy and confusion matrix for the three machine learning models were compared. In the comparative results, the XGBoost model resulted in the highest accuracy of 100 % for the road bridges, road tunnels, and retaining walls, effectively reflecting the time characteristics."

Five ML models are used to establish an optimal prediction model. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the ML model.Results Na+, hemoglobin (Hb), C-reactive protein (CRP), and globulin were independent risk factors for IVIG-resistance. A nonlinear relationship was identified between globulin level and IVIG-resistance. The XGBoost model exhibited excellent performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.821, accuracy of 0.748, sensitivity of 0.889, and specificity of 0.683 in the testing set. The XGBoost model was interpreted globally and locally using the SHAP method.Conclusion Na+, Hb, CRP, and globulin levels were independently associated with IVIG-resistance. Our findings demonstrate that ML models can reliably predict IVIG-resistance. Moreover, use of the SHAP method to interpret the established XGBoost model's findings would provide evidence of IVIG-resistance and guide the individualized treatment of Kawasaki disease."

Leveraging a dataset comprising 93 macroeconomic and financial variables spanning from August 2004 to June 2023, we employ various machine learning methods, including XGBoost and LSTM. While month-on-month inflation rates exhibit lower persistence, year-on-year rates demonstrate high persistence. Machine learning methods notably enhance month-on-month inflation forecasting accuracy. However, for year-on-year inflation forecasting, these methods perform less favorably compared to the random walk model. This underscores the necessity of caution when applying machine learning to highly persistent time series. Interestingly, converting month-on-month forecasts into year-on-year predictions yields reduced forecast losses and, in some cases, significantly outperforms the random walk model. Our results offer valuable insights for practitioners and policymakers seeking to leverage machine learning for inflation forecasting, emphasizing the nuanced impact of time series persistence on forecasting effectiveness."

First, the future population values of each demographic group were estimated through machine learning and explainable AI, and the estimates were interpreted. The population estimates showed that all three demographic groups are expected to continue to decline until 2042. The future heat wave vulnerable areas, derived by overlaying population estimates and future heat wave days by demographic group, were predicted to be mainly inland for all three demographic groups. The spatial distribution of future heat vulnerable areas by demographic group showed that the western part of the country is more vulnerable than the eastern part, and that the heat vulnerable areas for the young population will be located in Seoul, the southern part of the Seoul metropolitan area, and metropolitan areas, while the heat vulnerable areas for the working-age population will be located in Seoul, the southern part of the Seoul metropolitan area, and the Chungcheongbuk-do region.

Adopting the machine learning technique XGBoost, we identify 24 predictive factors related to demographic structure and determine their importance and direction in election prediction. Our findings reveal, firstly, a notable decrease in voter ratio among both men and women aged 30-50, compared to an increase in the 60+ and 20-29 age brackets, across the 20th and 21st elections. The ‘female-late MZ generation’ demographic emerges as a key predictor, with its growth negatively correlating with support for conservative candidates. The ‘male-traditional generation’ group is identified as a critical predictor of conservative support. However, the ‘male-30s’ group, while being the third most significant predictor, shows that an increase in this demographic results in a decrease in conservative support. Further, our analysis reveals that out of 1,094 towns in the metropolitan area, 834(76.2%) towns experience demographic shifts favoring conservative candidates when comparing data between the 21st and the forthcoming 22nd elections. These results suggest that demographic changes are likely to advantage the conservative party, particularly in the Seoul-metropolitan area."

This study presents a model that predicts EP based on various metrics that are difficult to measure quantitatively using machine learning, a scientific data approach. To construct the predictive model, 2,518 data from the Entrepreneurship Survey conducted by the Korea Entrepreneurship Foundation (KoEF) were used.

ECG signals represented as time series data are transformed into coefficients derived from second-order differential equations, enabling a compact and interpretable representation of the dynamics of each heartbeat. Using SINDy-extracted features, three machine learning models - logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost - were evaluated on the MIT-BIH and PTB-XL datasets.

In the binary classification experiments with the PTB-XL dataset, XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy of 92.98%. These findings suggest that differential-equation-based feature extraction offers a promising alternative to traditional ECG classification methods, combining high accuracy with interpretability. Future research will explore refining differential equations to capture complex ECG dynamics more precisely, as well as extending this approach to multicycle ECG patterns to further enhance classification accuracy."

If mortality rates in patients with sepsis can be predicted early, medical resources can be allocated efficiently. We constructed machine learning (ML) models to predict the mortality of patients with sepsis in a hospital emergency department.Methods: This study prospectively collected nationwide data from an ongoing multicenter cohort of patients with sepsis identified in the emergency department. Patients were enrolled from 19 hospitals between September 2019 and December 2020. For acquired data from 3,657 survivors and 1,455 deaths, six ML models (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost], light gradient boosting machine, and categorical boosting [CatBoost]) were constructed using fivefold cross-validation to predict mortality. Through these models, 44 clinical variables measured on the day of admission were compared with six sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) components (PaO2/FIO2 [PF], platelets (PLT), bilirubin, cardiovascular, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and creatinine).The confidence interval (CI) was obtained by performing 10,000 repeated measurements via random sampling of the test dataset. All results were explained and interpreted using Shapley’s additive explanations (SHAP).Results: Of the 5,112 participants, CatBoost exhibited the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.800 (95% CI, 0.756–0.840) using clinical variables. Using the SOFA components for the same patient, XGBoost exhibited the highest AUC of 0.678 (95% CI, 0.626–0.730). As interpreted by SHAP, albumin, lactate, blood urea nitrogen, and international normalization ratio were determined to significantly affect the results. Additionally, PF and PLTs in the SOFA component significantly influenced the prediction results.Conclusion: Newly established ML-based models achieved good prediction of mortality in patients with sepsis. Using several clinical variables acquired at the baseline can provide more accurate results for early predictions than using SOFA components.

Evaluation of statistical and machine learning models using satellite data to estimate aboveground biomass: A study in Vietnam Tropical Forests,2024,"['aboveground biomass estimation', 'satellite data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'tropical forest']",,"The combination of machine learning models with satellite imagery is becoming a popular data-modeling tool for biomass prediction, supporting land cover management. This study aims to select the most suitable model to estimate tropical forest aboveground biomass in Vietnam, helping to manage and monitor changes in biomass at regional and local scales. The study identified the optimal model for estimating forest aboveground biomass and minimizing the number of input variables while achieving satisfactory model performance. A total of 59 input variables, including topography, texture features, and vegetation indices, from satellite data were used in four non-parametric algorithms and a conventional parametric model, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to predict biomass and evaluate changes aboveground biomass over 10 years in two tropical forests in Vietnam. The results indicated that all models had good estimation performance with R2 ranging from 0.615 to 0.754. For RF, MLR, and XGBoost, vegetation indices contributed the highest model weights, occupying 77.71% – 92.48%. For ANN and SVM, textural and topographic features were the majority of the model weights (73.74 – 96.36%). The RF model performed the best using 59 variables (R2 = 0.754, MAE = 78.5 Mg∙ha−1, and %RMSE = 13.57%) and ten variables (R2 = 0.745, MAE = 85.8 Mg∙ha−1, and %RMSE = 16.17%). The biomass map using the RF and ten variables achieved a good degree of fitting of 0.76, so it was suitable for managing and monitoring forest biomass in Vietnam. The results indicated a sharp decrease in the areas of dense and very dense forests from 2013 to 2021 and a gradual increase in 2023."

In this situation, the ability to accurately predict the possibility of personal credit loan default is becoming important, and this study aims to predict default using standardized credit information data. Various approaches have been attempted in personal credit loan default prediction research, from statistical methods to machine learning, and recently, deep learning methods such as multilayer perceptron have been applied. However, multilayer perceptron does not reflect contextual information between input variables, so it does not show improvement in prediction performance compared to existing machine learning methods. In this study, in order to overcome the shortcomings of the existing multilayer perceptron methodology, the Transformer methodology, which is mainly used in the natural language processing field, was applied to the problem of personal credit loan default prediction, and as a result, it was confirmed that it showed an improvement in prediction performance compared to the existing deep learning and showed the same level of prediction performance as the XGBoost methodology, an ensemble-based decision tree with the best prediction performance among previous methods. The implication of this study is that the Transformer methodology, which is mainly used in natural language processing, can be effective in the problem of predicting personal credit loan defaults using tabular data consisting of various variables. This suggests that, compared to existing traditional modeling techniques, Transformer can better capture complex interactions between high-dimensional data and improve prediction performance. This shows that the Transformer model has the potential to expand its application range in various prediction problems in the financial field."

However, considering the substantial length of the highway (approximately 14,000km) and limited resources (only 17 patrol cars), an efficient strategy for patrolling is urgently needed. Patrolling regions with a high potential for black ice formation can be a reasonable solution. The problem lies in determining which regions have high potential. To address this gap, this study investigates three boosting algorithms- AdaBoost, XGBoost, and CatBoost-to identify regions likely to develop black ice. The models use atmospheric data as inputs, including relative humidity, air temperature, dew point, precipitation probability, and wind speed. Analysis on the atmospheric data reveals that nighttime icing typically happens when the air temperature is below 4°C and the relative humidity exceeds 75%. Moreover, black ice is more likely to form during temperature increases in the absence of precipitation. To assess the three models, baseline data were generated based on a physical principle that ice forms when pavement temperature is below freezing and lower than the dew point temperature. Consequently, all models demonstrated similar performance, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 90%. When the findings of this study applied to nighttime NH patrolling in winter, winter road maintenance activities can be much more effective and efficient as well."

To address this issue, this study proposes a noise reduction method that combines a Wave-U-Net-based deep learning model with a Wiener filter. Clean audio signals and various types of noise were synthesized to create a dataset consisting of clean signals (data1), signals with noise reduction applied (data2), and signals with an additional Wiener filter applied (data3). The dataset was generated at noise levels ranging from SNR 0 dB to 30 dB in 5 dB increments, and each model was trained using these datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed noise reduction method, the performance of Simple CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting), and SVM (Support Vector Machine) was measured on each dataset. Experimental results showed that noise reduction had a positive effect on performance in the SNR 0 dB to 5 dB range, but in environments with SNR levels above 10 dB, noise reduction led to performance degradation. This degradation is likely due to over-suppression of noise in lower-noise environments, which can distort the signal or result in unnecessary signal processing that harms the original signal quality. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of noise reduction in complex noise environments and highlights the need for further research to develop methods that maintain performance in higher SNR environments, particularly above 10 dB."

The results showed that brittle fracture, occurring vertically during the piercing of CFRP, had a significant impact on joint strength, while the gap between the rivet head and the sheet played a crucial role in determining joint strength in SGACEN-based joints. Various regression models were developed to predict joint quality, and machine learning models such as Randomforest and XGBoost were found to be more suitable than linear regression for use in different material combinations.

Containers are lighter and more advantageous for deployment than virtual machines because they do not require a separate operating system. However, containers can have security vulnerabilities due to their characteristic of sharing the same host kernel. In this paper, we designed and implemented a security system to address these vulnerabilities by using eBPF technology, kernel tracing logs, and an ensemble machine learning model. Our system can effectively detect attacks leveraging race conditions and the heap spray technique used in kernel memory vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional security policy-based approaches, it allows for rapid and dynamic responses without needing profile creation. For detecting attacks leveraging race conditions, the system achieved over 99% accuracy in Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, while it recorded over 97% accuracy across all metrics for heap spray detection."

An Interpretable Bearing Fault Diagnosis Model Based on Hierarchical Belief Rule Base,2024,"['belief rule base', 'bearing', 'fault diagnosis', 'extreme gradient boosting', 'class imbalance', 'interpretability']",,"Bearings are one of the main components of mechanical equipment and one of the primary components prone to faults. Therefore, conducting fault diagnosis on bearings is a key issue in mechanical equipment research. Belief rule base (BRB) is essentially an expert system that effectively integrates qualitative and quantitative information, demonstrating excellent performance in fault diagnosis. However, class imbalance often occurs in the diagnosis task, which poses challenges to the diagnosis. Models with interpretability can enhance decision-makers’ trust in the output results. However, the randomness in the optimization process can undermine interpretability, thereby reducing the level of trustworthiness in the results. Therefore, a hierarchical BRB model based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) feature selection with interpretability (HFS-IBRB) is proposed in this paper. Utilizing a main BRB alongside multiple sub-BRBs allows for the conversion of a multi-classification challenge into several distinct binary classification tasks, thereby leading to enhanced accuracy.

In Korea, the one-dimensional consolidation theory is applied during the design phase, and measurement-based prediction techniques (e.g., the hyperbolic method) are employed during the construction phase. However, these methods are limited because they may not fully reflect the site-specific characteristics or require long-term monitoring. Thus, in this study, ensemble-based deep learning models (i.e., the random forest, gradient boosting machine, XGBoost, and LightGBM models) were developed using the final fill height and ground information to improve the accuracy of the final settlement predictions and analyze the correlations with the input variables. In addition, a database was constructed from the measurement results and borehole data collected from six sites in Busan Port. The prediction results demonstrate that the random forest model achieved the highest accuracy with an average mean absolute error of 0.51 m and a mean absolute percentage error of 8.38%. In addition, the other models demonstrated high performance within specific data distributions; however, they tended to exhibit increased prediction errors when encountering out-of-distribution data. Shapley additive explanations analysis showed that the final fill height, plasticity index, consolidation ratio, clay layer thickness, and natural moisture content were the most significant contributors to predicting the final settlement."

This study proactively identifies the risk of student loan defaults and analyzes the key causal factors for it in order to suggest policies that enhance financial stability. To this end, this study utilizes data from the Korea Student Aid Foundation (KOSAF), a national institution, and, using various machine learning models, constructs a model to predict student loan default. The analysis applies the Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM models, thereafter using SHAP analysis to interpret the factors influencing loan defaults. The key results reveal that the CatBoost model demonstrates superior performance, depending on the type of school and loan. Key risk factors for higher default risk included being a student of humanities, social sciences, Art and Physical Education and education; being male; and securing grades below 80. Conversely, the factors that reduced default risk included studying Medical Science, attending metropolitan universities, having grades above 90, and being under 24. Based on these findings, policies for loan screening and delinquency management are suggested to enhance financial stability. This study emphasizes the use of machine learning techniques and explainable AI (XAI) models to improve the accuracy of student loan default predictions and provide valuable policy insights.

Comparative Analysis of Gradient-Boosting Ensembles for Estimation of Compressive Strength of Quaternary Blend Concrete,2024,"['Compressive strength', 'Quaternary blend concrete', 'Gradient-boosting algorithms', 'Ensemble machine learning']",,"Concrete compressive strength is usually determined 28 days after casting via crushing of samples. However, the design strength may not be achieved after this time-consuming and tedious process. While the use of machine learning (ML) and other computational intelligence methods have become increasingly common in recent years, findings from pertinent literatures show that the gradient-boosting ensemble models mostly outperform comparative methods while also allowing interpretable model. Contrary to comparison with other model types that has dominated existing studies, this study centres on a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance of four widely used gradient-boosting ensemble implementations [namely, gradient-boosting regressor, light gradient-boosting model (LightGBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and CatBoost] for estimation of the compressive strength of quaternary blend concrete. Given components of cement, Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), Fly Ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate in addition to the age of each concrete mixture as input features, the performance of each model based on R2, RMSE, MAPE and MAE across varying training–test ratios generally show a decreasing trend in model performance as test partition increases. Overall, the test results showed that CatBoost outperformed the other models with R2, RMSE, MAE and MAPE values of 0.9838, 2.0709, 1.5966 and 0.0629, respectively, with further statistical analysis showing the significance of these results. Although the age of each concrete mixture was found to be the most important input feature for all four boosting models, sensitivity analysis of each model shows that the compressive strength of the mixtures does increase significantly after 100 days. Finally, a comparison of the performance with results from different ML-based methods in pertinent literature further shows the superiority of CatBoost over reported the methods."

Proof of concept of the efficient design method for high-temperature superconducting magnets employing machine learning regression,2024,"['HTS magnet', 'machine learning regression technique', 'optimized design']",,"We present a newly developed machine learning based optimized design method for high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnet. Previous optimization design methods required performing thousands to tens of thousands of magnet characteristic calculations  repeatedly  to  evaluate  the  objective  functions  and  constraints.

Candidate grammatical collocations whose nodes are nouns were extracted from the Sejong Corpus. Six features were identified: the frequency of lexical chains, the entropy of adjacent words in lexical chains, the average distance and variance between components of lexical chains, and the entropy of preceding and following elements of lexical chains whose nodes are nouns. To address the class imbalance in the training data, eight sampling techniques were applied. Both the original and sampled datasets were trained using XGBoost to develop a classification model and evaluate its performance.The results indicated that the model trained on data sampled using a combination of SMOTE and ENN exhibited the highest accuracy and better classified the minority class of grammatical collocations. The most influential features were 'frequency', 'minimum entropy', and 'variance of average distance'. However, limitations were identified, as the frequency and information of adjacent words alone were insufficient to fully capture the contextual meaning and grammatical characteristics of collocations. Future research should utilize transformer-based pre-trained models and embedding techniques to extract features that reflect the contextual meaning and functions of grammatical collocations.

Specifically, night sleep duration, variability in overall sleep states, proportion of Deep sleep during night sleep, variability in REM sleep duration, and proportion of REM sleep during total daily sleep were found to be important features for detection MDD. Future work aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and robustness by expanding the datasets and feature variables, integrating advanced deep learning, and leveraging explainable AI with wearable device data to enable personalized, early detection and intervention for depression prevention and management."
머신러닝을 활용한 인구감소지역의 빈집 발생 요인 분석 및 추정 모델 개발 - 충청남도 공주시를 대상으로,2024,"['빈집', '머신러닝', '추정모델', '인구감소지역', 'Vacant Houses', 'Machine Learning', 'Prediction Model', 'Depopulation Regions']",,"The purpose of this study is to derive factors influencing the occurrence of vacant houses and develop a vacant houses prediction model using machine learning to improve the efficiency of the vacant house estimation method in depopulation region. To summarize the research results, first, in a review of previous research on factors affecting the occurrence of vacant houses, it was confirmed that vacant houses occur due to a complex effect of influencing factors of various scales and fields, which were divided into 20 influencing factors in Three sectors. Second, as a result of learning three models by setting the vacant house impact factors derived through previous research review and the confirmed vacant house data in Gongju City as learning data and target data, the XGBoost model showed the highest performance. In addition, it was confirmed that social and economic factors were also factors of high importance and that it was necessary to estimate vacant homes based on complex data. Third, when we compared the prediction results with the spatial environmental characteristics of Gongju City, it was predicted that areas with dense multi-household housing in the new downtown were likely to have vacant houses. In the old downtown and rural areas, it was predicted that areas with old detached house on slopes would have a high possibility of vacant houses. This study suggested a way to streamline the vacant house estimation process by developing a comprehensive data-based vacant house estimation model."
MAGRU: Multi-layer Attention with GRU for Logistics Warehousing Demand Prediction,2024,"['Gated Recurrent Unit', 'Attention mechanism', 'Commodities demand forecast', 'Time series', 'Neural Network']",,"Warehousing demand prediction is an essential part of the supply chain, providing a fundamental basis for product manufacturing, replenishment, warehouse planning, etc. Existing forecasting methods cannot produce accurate forecasts since warehouse demand is affected by external factors such as holidays and seasons. Some aspects, such as consumer psychology and producer reputation, are challenging to quantify. The data can fluctuate widely or do not show obvious trend cycles. We introduce a new model for warehouse demand prediction called MAGRU, which stands for Multi-layer Attention with GRU. In the model, firstly, we perform the embedding operation on the input sequence to quantify the external influences; after that, we implement an encoder using GRU and the attention mechanism. The hidden state of GRU captures essential time series. In the decoder, we use attention again to select the key hidden states among all-time slices as the data to be fed into the GRU network. Experimental results show that this model has higher accuracy than RNN, LSTM, GRU, Prophet, XGboost, and DARNN. Using mean absolute error (MAE) and symmetric mean absolute percentage error(SMAPE) to evaluate the experimental results, MAGRU’s MAE, RMSE, and SMAPE decreased by 7.65%, 10.03%, and 8.87% over GRU-LSTM, the current best model for solving this type of problem."
Using Machine Learning Models to  Identify Factors Associated With  30-Day Readmissions After Posterior  Cervical Fusions: A Longitudinal  Cohort Study,2024,"['Machine learning', 'Predictive modeling', 'Readmission', 'Spine', 'Costs', 'Posterior cervical fusion']",,"Objective: Readmission rates after posterior cervical fusion (PCF) significantly impact patients and healthcare, with complication rates at 15%–25% and up to 12% 90-day readmission rates. In this study, we aim to test whether machine learning (ML) models that capture interfactorial interactions outperform traditional logistic regression (LR) in identifying readmission-associated factors.Methods: The Optum Clinformatics Data Mart database was used to identify patients who underwent PCF between 2004–2017. To determine factors associated with 30-day readmissions, 5 ML models were generated and evaluated, including a multivariate LR (MLR) model. Then, the best-performing model, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), was compared to the LACE (Length patient stay in the hospital, Acuity of admission of patient in the hospital, Comorbidity, and Emergency visit) index regarding potential cost savings from algorithm implementation.Results: This study included 4,130 patients, 874 of which were readmitted within 30 days.When analyzed and scaled, we found that patient discharge status, comorbidities, and number of procedure codes were factors that influenced MLR, while patient discharge status, billed admission charge, and length of stay influenced the GBM model. The GBM model significantly outperformed MLR in predicting unplanned readmissions (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.846 vs. 0.829; p < 0.001), while also projecting an average cost savings of 50% more than the LACE index.Conclusion: Five models (GBM, XGBoost [extreme gradient boosting], RF [random forest], LASSO [least absolute shrinkage and selection operator], and MLR) were evaluated, among which, the GBM model exhibited superior predictive performance, robustness, and accuracy. Factors associated with readmissions impact LR and GBM models differently, suggesting that these models can be used complementarily. When analyzing PCF procedures, the GBM model resulted in greater predictive performance and was associated with higher theoretical cost savings for readmissions associated with PCF complications."
A Machine Learning Approach to ADHD Diagnosis Using Mutual Information and Stacked Classifiers,2024,"['EEG', 'ADHD', 'Machine learning', 'Mutual information', 'PCA', 'Stacked classifier']",,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental conditionin children characterized by impairments in attention, hyperactivity, and impulse control.Despite extensive research, the underlying cause of ADHD remains unclear. Electroen-cephalography (EEG), a noninvasive method for recording brain activity, is valuable forstudying ADHD-related neural patterns. This study explored the potential of EEG data todifferentiate children with ADHD and Healthy Controls (HC) to enhance diagnostic accuracy.We analyzed EEG recordings from 61 children with ADHD and 60 healthy controls. TheEEG data comprised signals from 19 scalp channels. Our primary objective was to develop amachine learning model capable of classifying ADHD subjects with ADHD from HC usingEEG data as discriminatory features. To select the most relevant features, we utilized mutualinformation (MI), a measure of the statistical dependence between two variables. The topfeatures were selected based on their minimum MI values, ensuring that they captured mean-ingful information from both ADHD and HC groups. Principal component analysis (PCA)was employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving the essential features, aiming tomitigate computational complexity. The selected features were then used to train ten differentclassifiers: random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),extra tree classifier (ET), XGBoost (XGB), support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression(LR), adaboost, classification and regression trees (CART), and gradient boosting machines(GBM). A stacked classifier was constructed by combining the outputs of all ten individualclassifiers, with the MLP acting as a meta-classifier. The stacked classifier outperformedindividual models, achieving an impressive accuracy of 92%. Its precision (91%) and sen-sitivity (93%) were also higher than those of the individual models, indicating its ability tocorrectly identify ADHD-positive cases. Furthermore, the specificity of the stacked classifier(93%) was superior, highlighting its improved proficiency in correctly classifying HC. Thiscomprehensive evaluation established the stacked classifier as an effective approach for ADHDclassification, surpassing the performance of several standalone models. Our proposed methodoffers a noninvasive, objective, and cost-effective method for identifying children with ADHD,leading to earlier diagnosis, intervention, and improved treatment outcomes."
