Toward A Transformative Spiritual Formation: Application of the Internal Family System Model and Its Implications to Korean Christian Education,2018,"['Han', 'Trauma', 'Korean Spirituality', 'Parts Work', 'Praxis', 'Educational curriculum', 'Transformation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This article explores a Transformative Praxis Pedagogy for Korean Christians with suffering and han as trauma. Until now Korean spirituality of Han has been studied from the theological and theoretical perspective because Korean church focused on the outward evangelization and numeric growth. Meanwhile, the interdisciplinary study for the practical healing and psychological transformation of Korean Christian spirituality and spiritual practice was lack in Korean church. So this study aims at developing a study of Transformative Praxis Pedagogy(TPP) based on the Internal Family System(IFS) model to help Korean Christian to be freed from the trauma of suffering from han. As a psychotherapical model, the IFS model and its Parts Work practice is an interdisciplinary theory and practice model integrated with Christian Spirituality which can provide empowerment to sufferers. With the assumption that on the IFS model provide such transformative praxis, this study explores the historical context of Korean spirituality and han, the theoretical foundation of IFS theory- its relation to Neuroscience and Christian theology, developing the ten-week curriculum of TPP for the practical theolgical and spiritual formational framework to study Korean Christian’s experience and response, and research their interview of the contemplative prayer and Parts Work in TPP by using the research methodology of case study. After the ten weeks of practice, the in-depth interview with six Korean Christian participants reveal the interpretative themes such as Marginality, Dynamic of Sufferings, Paradoxical understanding of Han, Recognition of Parts, Possibility of Healing and Compassion, Transformative Spirit in God. With these kinds of findings, this study conclude that there are the limitation of Korean spirituality and scarcity of praxis in Korean church, the importance of healing and transformation of IFS model, and the necessity of pragmatic spiritual formation for Korean church and its spirituality."
Simulation-Based Optimization on the System-of-Systems Model via Model Transformation and Genetic Algorithm: A Case Study of Network-Centric Warfare,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Simulation of a system-of-systems (SoS) model, which consists of a combat model and a network model, has been used to analyze the performance of network-centric warfare in detail. However, finding the combat model parameters satisfying the required combat power using simulation can take a long time for two reasons: (1) the prolonged execution time per simulation run and (2) the enormous number of simulation runs. This paper proposes a simulation-based optimization method for the SoS-based simulation model to overcome these problems. The method consists of two processes: (1) the transformation of the SoS-based model into an integrated model using the neural network to reduce the execution time and (2) the optimization of the integrated model using the genetic algorithm with ranking and selection to decrease the number of simulation runs. The experimental result reveals that the proposed method significantly reduced the time for finding the optimal combat parameters with an acceptable level of accuracy.</P>"
Kinetics Model of Bainitic Transformation With Stress,2018,"['phase transformation', 'thermal analysis', 'metals', 'dilatometry', 'rolling']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Thermal simulations were conducted on a Gleeble 3800 simulator. The main purpose is to investigate the effects ofstress on the kinetics of bainitic transformation in a Fe-C-Mn-Si advanced high strength bainitic steel. Previousstudies on modeling the kinetics of stress affected bainitic transformation only considered the stress below theyield strength of prior austenite. In the present study, the stress above the yield strength of prior austenite is takeninto account. A new kinetics model of bainitic transformation dependent on the stress (including the stresses belowand above the yield strength of prior austenite) and the transformation temperature is proposed. The new modelpresents a good agreement with experimental results. In addition, it is found that the acceleration degree of stresson bainitic transformation increases with the stress whether its magnitude is below or above the yield strength ofaustenite, but the increasing rate gradually slows down when the stress is above the yield strength of austenite."
"Simple, rapid and efficient transformation of genotype Nisqually-1 : a basic tool for the first sequenced model tree",2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Genotype Nisqually-1 is the first model woody plant with an available well-annotated genome. Nevertheless, a simple and rapid transformation of Nisqually-1 remains to be established. Here, we developed a novel shoot regeneration method for Nisqually-1 using leaf petiole and stem segment explants. Numerous shoots formed in the incision of explants within two weeks. The optimized shoot regeneration medium (SRM) contained 0.03 mg l-1 6-benzylaminopurine, 0.02 mg l-1 indole-3-butyric acid and 0.0008 mg l-1 thidiazuron. Based on this, Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of stem explants was examined using the vector pBI121 that contains the β-glucuronidase (GUS) as a reporter gene. Consequently, factors affecting transformation frequency of GUS-positive shoots were optimized as follows: Agrobacteria cell suspension with an OD600 of 0.4, 20 min infection time, 2 days of co-cultivation duration and the addition of 80 μM acetosyringone into Agrobacteria infective suspension and co-cultivation SRM. Using this optimized method, transgenic plantlets of Nisqually-1 – with an average transformation frequency of 26.7% – were obtained with 2 months. Southern blot and GUS activity staining confirmed the integration of the foreign GUS gene into Nisqually-1. This novel transformation system for Nisqually-1 was rapid, efficient, and simple to operate and will improve more genetic applications in this model tree."
Towards Responsible Management Education: A Transformational Model,2018,"['Responsible Management', 'Responsible Management Education', 'Business School', 'Corporate Social Responsibility', 'Business Ethics']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objectives: Although literature on the meaning and practice of responsible management education (RME) has recently been increasing in the field of business research, most of the literature is limited to a partial viewpoint, and a systematic approach to integrate related variables into a coherent context has been a rarity. This study presents a transformational model that integrates how to systematically approach a paradigm change of RME in business schools.Methods: After conducting a review of the literature on RME, this paper provides a transformational model for an integrated and systematic approach towards a successful paradigm shift in business education. The model consists of three inter-connected components: people (i.e., professors), pedagogy, and institutions (i.e., business schools).Results: Through the integrated transformational model, three interconnected components are described for the full implementation of the new paradigm in business education. This study proposes a dynamic relationship between each component and a successful paradigm change in management education.Conclusions: The new management education paradigm change based on the principles of RME has become a matter of practice, not a matter of choice. There are technological aspects such as the management of business schools as an organization and teaching methodologies for successful change management in business education, but what is more important is the matter of the consciousness of professors. It is time to reflect upon the ontological purpose of teaching as a business professor and to recuperate a sense of calling."

Communication Analysis of Network-Centric Warfare via Transformation of System of Systems Model into Integrated System Model Using Neural Network,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Communication system in the network-centric warfare (NCW) has been analyzed from the perspective of the system of systems (SoS), which consists of a combat system and a network system so that the two reflect each other’s effects. However, this paradoxically causes a prolonged execution time. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an advanced integrated modeling method for the communication analysis in the NCW via the transformation of the SoS, which reduces the simulation execution time while ensuring the accuracy of the communication effects. The proposed models mainly cover interentity traffic and intraentity mobility developed in the form of feed-forward neural networks to guarantee two-way interactions between the combat system and the network system. Because they are characterized as discrete events, the proposed models are designed with the discrete-event system specification (DEVS) formalism. The experimental results show that the proposed transformation reduced an error by 6.40% compared to the existing method and reduced the execution time 3.78-fold compared to the SoS-based NCW simulation.</P>"

< 구두-B-04 > Species-specific features in bag-of-features model,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Bag-of-features (BOF) model is one of the computer vision-based method to classify image, and this model was derived from the bag-of-words model developed for automatic classification of documents. The BOF is simple and powerful, so it widely used for image classification. In this study, we tried to identify Lauraceae image database. The database including 1658 optical micrographs form 11 genera with 39 species. Lauraceae is known as a family that is difficult to identify because of its vast variety of species and similar features. It is the reason why we want to identify this family by the computer vison-based method. The image features were extracted using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm, and the identification was performed by the support vector machine (SVM). To find the species-specific feature, we used tf-idf (term frequency - inverse document frequency) score weight. The score of common features are reduced, while score of rare, unique, and important features are increased. From the tf-idf score, therefore, we can find the species-specific features. The identification accuracy of the BOF was excellent at 98.2%. The accuracy is slightly higher than the 95.4% accuracy of our previous study that used only the SIFT algorithm and SVM without using the BOF. The tf-idf score showed important features for each species, and the features varied from species to species. Furthermore, the species-specific features differed by species in the same anatomical features and even showed area-specific characteristics within the same anatomical features of the same species. From the BOF model with the tf-idf score, we were able to better understand what the computer looks from the image."
Model-Based Winding Tension Profile to Minimize Radial Stress in a Flexible Substrate in a Roll-to-Roll Web Transporting System,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In this study, we propose a model-based taper tension profile that minimizes residual and radial stresses. In contrast to the constant torque and hyperbolic taper profile, the developed model can accurately decrease the winding tension depending upon the final decrement set by a user regardless of the maximum wound radius. Moreover, the model steeply decreases the winding tension in comparison to other tension models in the early stage, consequently, decreasing the residual stress and maximum radial stress. A hybrid model that combines the developed and conventional taper tension models is developed to expand the range of application of the model. A winding tension maker that applies the model to the winding tension controller is also developed. A variable transformation model that transforms the input of the developed model (radius ratio) to the winding time, which can be easily obtained without any sensors, is obtained. The developed model and winding tension maker are applied to an industrial roll-to-roll thin film winding machine. It is observed that local deformation in a wound thin film generated by the excessive radial stress is improved. A control technique is selected considering film characteristics, and a winding tension controller is designed using the developed tension models and winding tension maker. The designed winding tension controller decreases the maximum radial stress by 38% when compared to the case before application. Moreover, the winding length with few local deformations increases from 100 to 500 m; this confirms the superiority of the developed model and controller.</P>"
Vibration Analysis of Transformer DC bias Caused by HVDC based on EMD Reconstruction,2018,"['Transformer vibration', 'HVDC transmission', 'Signal reconstruction', 'EMD']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper proposes a new approach utilizing empirical mode decomposition (EMD) reconstruction to process vibration signals of a transformer under DC bias caused by high voltage direction transmission (HVDC), which is the potential cause of additional vibration and noise from transformer. Firstly, the Calculation Method is presented and a 3D model of transformer is simulated to analyze transformer deformation characteristic and the result indicate the main vibration is produced along axial direction of three core limbs. Vibration test system has been built and test points on the core and shell of transformer have been measured. Then, the signal reconstruction method for transformer vibration based on EMD is proposed. Through the EMD decomposition, the corrupted noise can be selectively reconstructed by the certain frequency IMFs and better vibration signals of transformer have been obtained. After EMD reconstruction, the vibrations are compared between transformer in normal work and with DC bias. When DC bias occurs, odd harmonics, vibration of core and shell, behave as a nonlinear increase and the even harmonics keep unchanged with DC current. Experiment results are provided to collaborate our theoretical analysis and to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed EMD method."
DYNAMIC EVALUATION OF BUSINESS MODEL QUALITY,2018,"['business model', 'dynamic evaluation', 'quality', 'qualitative comparative analysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Successful business models have some shared attributes or features. The quality of the business model can be used to determine the feasibility and potential of the business model, which can help make decisions on how to invest and risk prevention. However, the business model is not static, but changes with external factors such as demand, competition, technology, macro policies, and internal factors such as business goals, strategies, and resources. Therefore, the requirements of the quality attributes of the business model at each stage are different. Dynamic evaluation of business model quality is essential for the development of any enterprises, but on the emerging issue, academic research has greatly lagged behind the needs of business practices. Fist in this paper, the generation and evolution of the business model is divided into four stages: blueprint design, practical modeling, application copying, and transformational change. Then, based on reviewing literature, seven key attributes of business model quality are identified, namely, uniqueness, complementary, novelty, certainty, scalability, win-win and matching degree. Thereafter, by using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (FsQCA), some configurations of key attributes of business model quality are identified, which are considered critical paths for the business success. Finally, the theory of dynamic evaluation of business model quality has been put forward and used to assess the sample business model."

A PERCEIVED SERVICE QUALITY MODEL IN SHARING ECONOMY: THE CASE OF AIRBNB,2018,"['service quality', 'on-site hospitality', 'experience', 'cognitive', 'attitudinal']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Introduction The idiom “you are what you own” has been considerably transformed into “you are what you can access”. The shift from ownership to access, the results of endless hyper-consumption, and the change in value mindsets initiated a new phenomenon, which is Sharing Economy (SE). SE has grown rapidly and refers to an entirely new business model, socio-economic ecosystem, and context for sharing the access to goods and services in technology-enabled peer-to-peer (P2P) ecosystems or consumer-to-consumer (C2C) engagement platforms. According to Botsman and Rogers (2010), SE is a result of the linkage between offline and online world, which was triggered by the society to overcome natural resources constraints. Resources in SE can be tangible (e.g., cars and homes) and intangible (e.g., expert local knowledge and labor). SE allows the sustainable use of idle resources, and it enables sellers to create new and flexible opportunities to market to consumers who experience personalized and even customized products and services at lower prices (Yang, Song, Chen, & Xia, 2017). SE opened up new horizons for a considerable number of new players across industries from a supply perspective by broadening the options for supply, which also remedies the response to peak demand. SE has given a rise to the humanization of consumer-supplier relationship in tourism and hospitality (TH), and sharing has become a mainstream practice in this context. The recent shift of customers‟ willingness to share accommodation with a host as opposed to using a private hotel room has many implications for TH (Lu & Kandampully, 2016). For example, Airbnb has become one of the most prominent competitors in hotel industry, and it enables people to lease or rent short-term accommodation including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, and even experiences via instant booking. From cash-strapped travelers to high-end business travelers, Airbnb has revolutionized the TH service in a new form of contractual relationship and gained a well-grounded popularity. Some scholars, on the other hand, argued that SE is a “fundamentally different business model” which could make it a new marketplace instead of a direct competitor in hotel industry. From this point of view, Airbnb do not compete or pose a challenge to traditional TH services but extend the concept of TH (Lu & Kandampully, 2016). Hotel industry has reactively responded to the direct, indirect, and induced effects of Airbnb to economy, and Airbnb‟s impact on hotel industry have recently been researched by several scholars (Mody, Suess, & Lehto, 2017; Priporas, Stylos, Rahimi, & Vedanthachari, 2017; Zervas, Proserpio, & Byers, 2017). Customer engagement in TH has been empirically found to enhance customers‟ service brand evaluation, brand trust, and brand loyalty (So, King, Sparks, & Wang, 2016). Guests attach great importance to motivational drivers, more meaningful “beyond-purchase” social interactions and unique experiences in authentic settings, which give rise to customer engagement beyond the service encounter. Disruptive innovation theory also states that products or services that offer alternative benefits compared to conventional attributes can transform a market and attain a critical mass, which can be observed in Airbnb‟s story (Young, Corsun, & Xie, 2017). Airbnb is successfully promoting the mottos of “Belong Anywhere” and “Don’t Go There. Live There” to their guests. The feelings of trust and belonging were negatively changed by mass production and noncustom travel experiences, and people sometimes forgot the meaning of community due to high tendency of prestige and advertising. Consumers‟ changing attitudes towards utilization and accessibility compared to ownership created an indirect need for intimate connection between people, namely human connection. Then, social concerns upon products and services gave a rise to mass-customized product and service expectations of consumers. This is where Airbnb‟s value proposition comes into play. First, it creates not only financial but also personal rewards through a “personal concierge” and a “home away from home” experience. Second, Airbnb is not a simple transaction, rather it is deemed to be a lifetime experience. So “guest experience” is at the heart of Airbnb‟s strategic position. From the “experience” point of view, SE has also opened up new rooms for service research. Service in the context of Airbnb is considered as an experience, rather than a utilitarian relation. Also, service quality has always been a critical factor in highly-competitive service industries like TH. Service quality perception is multi-faceted, and the studies focusing on it are rather limited, especially in hotel industry. These studies highlighted the complexities associated with evaluating service quality and the contribution of service process delivery on service outcomes, which results in the perception of service quality. Therefore, perceived service quality can be influenced by different internal processes and interpersonal variables. In order to study service quality in Airbnb, the types of settings in this context are to be noted. There are two main types of hosting via Airbnb: (1) remote hospitality, which refers to hosting situations in which the host does not physically share the place with the guest (e.g. booking the entire place), and (2) on-site hospitality, where the host is physically present and sharing the apartment with the guest. Mainly, on-site hospitality is an important part of the sociability within the host–guest relationship. Priporas et al. (2017) studied service quality in the context of remote hospitality, and we decided to respond to their relevant call for future research on the other type of Airbnb accommodation, which is on-site hospitality referring to “Shared Rooms” and “Private Rooms” in Airbnb‟s listings. “Shared Rooms” refer to an exact communal experience with the host, and guests sleep in a space that is shared with others and share the entire space with other people. “Private Rooms” refer to privacy, to some extent, in which guests (i) value a local connection (ii) have their own private room for sleeping and (iii) may share some spaces with others. We do expect that human connection and experience gap can be better researched with on-site hospitality existing in “Shared Rooms” and “Private Rooms”. This is because hosts design their services to create and build a relationship with their guests, leading to superior guest experiences and the so-called positive moment-of-truth. In addition to the online storytelling on hosts‟ home pages, the most important moment-of-truth is created during the guests‟ stay at the host‟s place; thus, the host plays a major role in the customer‟s perception of service and the subsequent review of the experience (Lu & Kandampully, 2016). Considering the previously mentioned “experience gap” in the literature, our research question and relevant sub-questions are as follows:• What are the antecedents of perceived service quality in Airbnb on-site hospitality? o How well does SERVQUAL suffice for measuring perceived service quality in this context? o How well the cognitive and attitudinal factors expand this measurement? o What are the additional perceived service quality factors that can be derived from guests‟ online textual reviews to remedy the “experience gap”? Literature review Cheng (2016) conducted a systematic review of SE by using co-citation and content analysis of papers, and the findings reveal three distinct research areas of SE: (1) SE‟s business models and its impacts, (2) Nature of SE, and (3) SE‟s sustainability development. Moreover, two unique areas, specifically in TH, were identified: (1) SE‟s impacts on destinations and TH services and (2) SE‟s impacts on tourists. The comparison of both literatures has revealed limited expansion in TH literature despite the fact that TH are at the frontier of SE (Cheng, 2016). Pesonen and Tussyadiah (2017) conducted cluster analysis to identify user profiles corresponding to consumer motivations for using TH services of SE. They concluded that a consumer group uses TH services of SE to make their trips more convenient, while another group uses these services mostly for social reasons. Yang et al. (2017) studied the loyalty in SE services from relational benefits perspective and concluded that confidence and social benefits have significant and positive effects on commitment in SE services. Molz (2014) introduced the term „Network Hospitality‟, which is relatively new and rooted in old traditions of welcoming strangers. Airbnb represents just one of many types of network hospitality, and in Airbnb, trust is almost shaped based on peer reviews, not solely on one-to-one peer interactions. The online review information becomes the basis for members‟ reputation in the network. The information accumulated on Airbnb‟s online platform helps both parties to establish their reputation, as well as publicizing their personalities, thereby facilitating the process of finding the best match. Moreover, there are hundreds of people working in Airbnb‟s customer service, trust, and safety departments who are devoted to ensuring the intimacy provision of trusted services. Airbnb requires all hosts to abide by their “Hospitality Standards”, which include expected levels of cleanliness, commitment, and communication. The flexibility, reliability, and consistency of Airbnb‟s service providers help them to build and maintain the relationship Airbnb enjoys with their guests and hosts (Lu & Kandampully, 2016; Zervas et al., 2017). Pine and Gilmore (1998) predicted the rise of experience in their seminal study, referring to the “experience economy” and also stating “As goods and services become commoditized, the customer experiences that companies create will matter most.” They called this as “Staging Experiences”. Also, there exists evidence in literature that providers are shifting their focus from product- and service-oriented to design of quality experiences. In terms of the glamour of SE in TH, a “more unique experience” is deemed to be second only to better pricing. Airbnb may eventually address all elements of the accommodation experience, from travel reservations to ticketing for local attractions. Consumers are looking for local authenticity in their travels. Psychological authenticity refers to emotional genuineness, self-attunement, and psychological depth (Walls, Okumus, Wang, & Kwun, 2011). If TH industry is to surpass its SE competition in terms of guest experience, it should leverage an expanded experience economy paradigm that incorporates additional dimensions (Mody et al., 2017). Authentic host-guest experiences probably only exist between like-minded and privileged members who possess high cultural capital (Cheng, 2016). With that, Walls et al. (2011) have suggested the need for researchers to identify specific dimensions “that exist in both our everyday and tourist experiences”. Both in Airbnb and traditional TH, guest satisfaction and likelihood to reuse are driven by similar factors such as quality and utility of services, trust to the host, and economic value. There are several models for measuring service quality, including SERVQUAL (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, & Berry, 1988) and SERVPERF (Cronin & Taylor, 1992). Service quality literature received widespread attention after the seminal work by Parasuraman et al. (1988) as they proposed the gap model and developed SERVQUAL (an attribute-based technique) as a tool for measuring service quality. According to SERVQUAL, service quality consists of five dimensions measured by a total of 22 items. The proposed five service quality dimensions are tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. SERVQUAL basically requires measures of expectations and performance, and service quality is calculated from subtractions between these two components (i.e., performance [P] - expectations [E]). Regarding service quality in TH, Akbaba (2006) utilized SERVQUAL for business hotels, and Priporas et al. (2017) inquired SERVQUAL‟s applicability in Airbnb context with promising results. The major distinction between two research directions (i.e. hotels vs. Airbnb) is that even though guests expect similar core services such as clean rooms and comfortable beds, different attributes support the competitive advantage of hotels and Airbnb. While conveniences offered by hotels are unparalleled by Airbnb accommodation, the latter appeal to consumers driven by experiential and social motivations (Pesonen & Tussyadiah, 2017). Research model This research aims to identify the antecedents of perceived service quality of guests‟ in Airbnb on-site hospitality context. Our research model is presented in Figure 1, and it is subject to enhancement through the analytics of guest reviews. A survey will be developed to test the proposed research model. The items of constructs will be mainly derived from extant literature and enriched with the linguistic and textual analysis of reviews. Firstly, factors shaping expectation are predicted as per the literature and preliminary analysis of random guest reviews: (i) host‟s reputation capital (e.g., ratings and reviews), (ii) host‟s photos, (iii) guest‟s past accommodation experience, and (iv) word of mouth. Secondly, SERVQUAL part in the model is the same as proposed by Parasuraman et al. (1988). Last but not least, Airbnb is deemed to promote global geographical imaginaries (e.g., collaboration, social equity, solidarity, community, trust, reciprocity, altruism, autonomy, intimacy, and authenticity) to justify their business model (O‟Regan & Choe, 2017). Finally, regarding the guest review analysis, Airbnb has a detailed review mechanism, and we have gathered the publicly available reviews that are up to 500 words. We have observed cognitive and attitudinal dimensions within reviews through text analytics and grouped those in the research model as follows: • Intimacy: The emergence of intimacy as a commercial value in TH industry has been researched. (e.g., How well people know each other? How people occupy space together? How people share private information, family pictures, furniture choice etc.?) (Prager, 1997) • Authenticity: We focus on the existential authenticity (i.e., being one‟s true self or being true to one‟s essential nature) from guests‟ perceptions (e.g., Is Airbnb like ‘living the local life’?) (Lalicic & Weismayer, 2017) • Commitment: It refers to the consistent behavior of Airbnb hosts in terms of social and cost components. (e.g., How well hosts abide by Airbnb policies and procedures? Do hosts have ongoing effectiveness of service?) (Lu & Kandampully, 2016) • Privacy: It refers to the psychological zone to disclose personal and cultural values. Informational and physical privacy threats are important in Airbnb context (Lutz, Hoffmann, Bucher, & Fieseler, 2017).• Security: It refers to the state of being free from danger or threat. According to Yang and Ahn (2016), security in Airbnb‟s services is a more powerful antecedent of attitude toward Airbnb than significant dimensions of motivation toward SE, such as enjoyment and reputation. With that we will only elaborate on interpersonal security in Airbnb (i.e., between host and guest, not between guest and Airbnb). Conclusion SE is a fairly new and multi-disciplined field that covers open rooms for research, and specifically, Airbnb is one of the most prominent businesses in this context. The literature review presented underlies the infancy of well-grounded studies covering service quality perceptions of customers in SE. Seeking for additional dimensions from Airbnb guests‟ reviews is a novel research approach in studying customer engagement, and those dimensions shall be included in the research model. This research has certain limitations. Our perceived service quality conceptualization requires empirical validation to establish the boundaries of the construct. The guest reviews in Airbnb are subject to data quality issues. Also, reviews should contain substantial amount of words up to a certain threshold. Data collection from emerging world regions is rather tough since Airbnb is not widespread across those regions. Thus, US and European countries will be firstly taken into account, where the use of Airbnb is quite common. The study is expected to provide useful insights for TH practitioners and managers. It can underlie the factors that trigger customer engagement in this context. Cognitive/attitudinal factors are foreseen as the differentiators, which stand as the basis for service design and delivery."
Vibration Analysis of Transformer DC bias Caused by HVDC based on EMD Reconstruction,2018,"['Transformer vibration', 'HVDC transmission', 'Signal reconstruction', 'EMD']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper proposes a new approach utilizing empirical mode decomposition (EMD) reconstruction to process vibration signals of a transformer under DC bias caused by high voltage direction transmission (HVDC), which is the potential cause of additional vibration and noise from transformer. Firstly, the Calculation Method is presented and a 3D model of transformer is simulated to analyze transformer deformation characteristic and the result indicate the main vibration is produced along axial direction of three core limbs. Vibration test system has been built and test points on the core and shell of transformer have been measured. Then, the signal reconstruction method for transformer vibration based on EMD is proposed. Through the EMD decomposition, the corrupted noise can be selectively reconstructed by the certain frequency IMFs and better vibration signals of transformer have been obtained. After EMD reconstruction, the vibrations are compared between transformer in normal work and with DC bias. When DC bias occurs, odd harmonics, vibration of core and shell, behave as a nonlinear increase and the even harmonics keep unchanged with DC current. Experiment results are provided to collaborate our theoretical analysis and to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed EMD method."
S-I model of horizontal jet grouting reinforcement for soft soil,2018,"['superposition-iteration', 'tunnel reinforcement', 'horizontal jet grouting', 'analytical solution']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A superposition-iteration (S-I) model is proposed to simulate the jet grouting pre-reinforcing impact for a shallow-buried tunnel. The common model is deduced by theoretical (force equilibrium) analysis and then transformed into the numerical formulation. After applying it to an actual engineering problem, the most obvious deficiency was found to be continuous error accumulation, even when the parameters change slightly. In order to address this problem, a superposition-iteration model is developed based on the basic assumption and superposition theory. First, the additional deflection between two successive excavation steps is determined. This is caused by the disappearance of the supporting force in the excavated zone and the soil pressure in the disturbed zone. Consequently, the final deflection can be obtained by repeatedly superposing the additional deflection to the initial deflection in the previous steps. The analytical solution is then determined with the boundary conditions. The superposition-iteration model is thus established. This model was then applied and found to be suitable for real-life engineering applications. During the calculation, the error induced by the ill-conditioned problem of the matrix is easily addressed. The precision of this model is greater compared to previous models. The sensitivity factors and their impact are determined through this superposition-iteration model."

An Experimental and Numerical Investigation on the Twist Springback of Transformation Induced Plasticity 780 Steel Based on Different Hardening Models,2018,"['Transformation induced plasticity (TRIP)', 'Hardening model', 'Twist springback', 'Springback compensation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Investigation on twist springback is important to improve the accuracy of forming parts. In this paper, a double C rail made of transformation induced plasticity 780 (TRIP 780) steel is designed, and the stamping and twist springback are simulated with ABAQUS based on three different hardening models (including Ziegler, Johnson-Cook and combined hardening models). A new index for calculating the twist springback is proposed, which is based on the angle between two end section lines of the double C rail. The experimental results of twist springback are compared with the calculation results from three different hardening models. The calculation results based on combined hardening model are the closest to the experiment data. In order to compensate twist springback, a curved surface die is designed based on the geometric shape of the double C rail after twist springback. The stamping and twist springback are simulated based on the curved surface die and combined hardening model, and the twist springback is decreased obviously after compensation, which shows that the compensation of twist springback is effective."

Analysis Model of Cost-Effectiveness for Value Evaluation of Building Elements,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>As various building materials have been developed, the combination of materials that make up the building elements has also increased exponentially. The materials making up the elements of the building will affect the performance of the building and the LCC. In order to improve the value of buildings in Korea, value engineering has been mandated in public construction projects with a project cost of over 10 billion won since 2000. The value index for systems (materials, elements, facilities, etc.) constituting buildings is calculated. However, the method for calculating the value index has not yet been normalized. The performance evaluation of the building systems (materials, elements, facilities, etc.) used in the current work and the method of calculating the value index for converting the LCC into a grade may vary depending on how the range of the grade is set. Even if the objects being evaluated are the same, there arises a problem that the results change depending on the value evaluation method. Therefore, this study tried to develop a value evaluation method that could draw consistent value evaluation results. For this purpose, this study presents a cost-effectiveness analysis model for the physical performance of the building elements and the value evaluation of LCC. Since the various physical performances of the building elements have different properties, normalization is required for comparison of physical performance values. In order to normalize the LCC and the 14 different physical performances of the building elements, a numerical model was designed using a linear transformation method and a vector normalization method. The cost-effectiveness analysis model proposed in this study was applied to two types of floor elements applicable to apartments in Korea, in order to evaluate the value and verify the consistency of this study’s model. The cost-effectiveness analysis model proposed in this study can help to derive reliable results when it comes to value evaluation for various existing building element compositions.</P>"
Neural-Network Model for Compensation of Lens Distortion in Camera Calibration,2018,"['Camera calibration', 'Lens distortion', '3D measurement', 'Neural network', 'Transformation matrix']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Camera calibration for machine vision is critical in three-dimensional (3-D) measurement systems based on a digital light processing (DLP) projector and a camera. The Z-height of the measurement point is calculated using the phase value observed by the camera when a fringe pattern is scanned from a projection onto an object. On the other hand, the X and Y coordinates are obtained from the camera coordinates using a transformation matrix, and the mathematical model for lens distortion is additionally used. However, the errors for x and y coordinates are 10 times larger than the z-height error in an experiment. This is because the lens distortion is not sufficiently compensated in the mathematical model considering only the position from the lens center. Therefore, the neural network (NN) model that considers the measurement distance in addition to the position is proposed in this paper. Experiments were conducted on a 100 × 100 mm2 area, and a maximum error of 0.5 mm is observed for the mathematical model. However, when the NN model considering the height of the object is used, the error is reduced by 60% to 0.2 mm."

Third, a unified model is built through the adjoint transformation of Lie groups in consideration of the two effectors of the virtual screw. The error pose is decomposed into orientation and position errors, which are obtained through the virtual screw. Finally, an open-chain manipulator with six degrees of freedom is analyzed based on the proposed model. The position and orientation errors are obtained with the trajectory that provided an intuitive geometric insight into the accuracy and exact maximal position and orientation errors."

Rapid spread of Internet technologies has a significant impact on the business models transformation. Today, information technology has become an integral part of communication with customers. In 2017 the penetration rate of the Internet in Russia reached 73%. Thus, almost 3/4 of the population is currently Internet users and be reached online. On the one hand, Internet communication speeds up and simplifies the processes; on the other hand, the key competitive advantage of direct selling business model is blurred. For ages business model was based on direct interpersonal contacts between the distributor and the customer. In this business model relationship creates more value than the product itself [Luk, Fullgrabe, Yi, 1996] and face-to-face meeting is the key descriptor [Sanan, 1997]. Direct selling is cultivated through relationships and provides customer-centric marketing opportunities [Harrison, Hair, 2017]. The question of this study is whether introduction of innovative Internet technologies into communication with customers is beneficial for traditional direct selling business model. Empirical research is based on comparative analysis of data from three survey waves (6380 respondents in 2011, 5638 respondents in 2014 and 6800 respondents in 2017). Effectiveness of Internet usage the for communicate with customers was analized in dynamics over the three waves of 2011, 2014, 2017. Using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) method 15 (fifteen) hypotheses were checked. Nine (9) out of 15 (fifteen) hypotheses were confirmed. Research revealed that personalization determines the effectiveness of communication with customers via internet-based tools (e-mail, web site, social networks, professional social networks, video channels, blogs, microblogs, videoconferences and webinars, messaging applications and files).

Therefore, it is necessary to transform system description into a diagram which clearly depicts the behaviour of the system as well as the interaction between components. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safety Glossary, The safety system is a system important to safety, provided to ensure the safe shutdown of the reactor or the residual heat removal from the reactor core, or to limit the consequences of anticipated operational occurrences and design basis accidents.

The outcome of this successful profitable business model has been able to demonstrate that such hearing and speech impaired individuals could be turned from being ‘social liabilities’ to ‘social positive assets’. The ‘social liability’ denotes to Mirchi & Mime employees being hearing and speech impaired who suffer from social, economic, financial and familial exclusion. The focal point of this study is to understand the transformation of such entities termed as ‘social liability’ to ‘social capital’ which has been possible within the span of three years. The study uses mixed method research to elicit, quantify and substantiate the building of social capital through the positive psychological, social and economic changes brought about in people who belong to the bottom of the pyramid (BoP). The study uses four different approaches to assess and validate the conceptual model and research objective. One, using survey instrument for guests (consumers) which included 32 items in total and 27 items were measured using likert type scale (5= strongly agree & 1- strongly disagree). Two, employee interview questionnaire was open ended. The questions intend to address the aspects such as regular vs special schooling, challenges experienced in daily routine, employee’s aspiration, pre-employment- economic, social and psychological condition and their post-employment changes, including their perception about the society. Three, the in-depth video-based interview with employee’s family- the questions revolved around their economic, social and psychological transformation pre and post-employment. Fourth, is personality assessment of selected few employees to understand implicit perception about ‘self’ and ‘world’. The quantitative outcome is obtained through descriptive and inferential analysis. The study empirically captures the social capital development with an extensive research from individual psycho-sociological perspective to familial- societal perspective. The study encapsulates an inward to outward outlook of hearing and speech impaired employees and how Mirchi & Mime a fine-dine restaurant (a profit making firm) has successfully converted a social liability into a social capital. Mirchi & Mime consistently maintained its top ranking on Indian restaurant search and discovery service (Zomato). Hence, the study contributes in justifying the viewpoint that social liability is a myth in fact if, employed strategically this would lead to economic and social inclusiveness and business sustainability."
Structural behavior of arch dams considering experimentally validated prototype model using similitude and scaling laws,2018,"['arch dam', 'finite element analyses', 'scaling laws', 'similarity requirements']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"As one of the most important engineering structures, arch dams are huge constructions built with human hands and have strategical importance. Because of the fact that long construction duration, water supply, financial reasons, major loss of life and material since failure etc., the design of arch dams is very important problem and should be done by expert engineers to determine the structural behavior more accurately. Finite element analyses and non-destructive experimental measurements can be used to investigate the structural response, but there are some difficulties such as spending a long time while modelling, analysis and in-situ testing. Therefore, it is more useful to conduct the research on the laboratory conditions and to transform the obtained results into real constructions. Within the scope of this study, it is aimed to determine the structural behavior of arch dams considering experimentally validated prototype laboratory model using similitude and scaling laws. Type-1 arch dam, which is one of five arch dam types suggested at the “Arch Dams” Symposium in England in 1968 is selected as reference prototype model. The dam is built considering dam-reservoir-foundation interaction and ambient vibration tests are performed to validate the finite element results such as dynamic characteristics, displacements, principal stresses and strains. These results are considered as reference parameters and used to determine the real arch dam response with different scales factors such as 335, 400, 416.67 and 450. These values are selected by considering previously examined dam projects. Arch heights are calculated as 201 m, 240 m, 250 m and 270 m, respectively. The structural response is investigated between the model and prototype by using similarity requirements, field equations, scaling laws etc. To validate these results, finite element models are enlarged in the same scales and analyses are repeated to obtain the dynamic characteristics, displacements, principal stresses and strains. At the end of the study, it is seen that there is a good agreement between all results obtained by similarity requirements with scaling laws and enlarged finite element models."

For many decades, under the anticommunist and authoritarian South Korean government, the truth of what became known as the Jeju 4.3 Incident was not investigated and the victims went unrecognized. With democratization, a remarkable transformation took place as a government-sponsored commission was established to establish the truth about the massacre and to recognize the victims. In this process, the civilians of Jeju played both a major and magnanimous role that sought to determine the truth and commemorate the victims but not to seek retribution. As a result, Jeju’s identity has undergone a dramatic change as it has come to be known as a place synonymous with forgiveness, peace, human rights, and reconciliation. The people of Jeju are now forging a remarkable path towards truth, reconciliation, and coexistence that may be referred to as the ‘’’Jeju model.’’ This paper firmly argues that this Jeju model should not be limited to Jeju but be extended to South Korea, the whole Korean Peninsula, East Asia, and even beyond as a way of healing past trauma and wrongdoing."
Localization of Airborne Platform Using Digital Elevation Model With Adaptive Weighting Inspired by Information Theory,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In this paper, we discuss the use of radar sensor to localize an airborne platform using a proposed rotation-invariant template matching algorithm based on data fusion. If a digital elevation model (DEM) under the platform is measured by radar, it can be used to estimate the position of the platform through comparing a pre-recorded DEM of large area through template matching. We implemented four different rotation-invariant template-matching algorithms and compared their performances from the perspective of position estimation accuracy and computational complexity. Based on the investigations, we chose a Fourier transform-based method that utilizes the characteristic of magnitude invariance with the shift of the original data. To improve the position estimation by providing more information, the gradients of DEM were derived. To combine the total error cost from the original DEM and its gradient, we employ an adaptive weighting inspired by the information theory. A higher weight is given to data that have more information. The information is measured as entropy, which is the inverse of the probability that the error cost is the minimum out of all possible error costs in the template-matching process. Through the suggested adaptive weighting, the position estimation accuracy has been increased by 16.04% compared with the uniform weighting. Compared with only using a DEM, the use of gradients of DEM improves the accuracy by 55.37%.</P>"

An Improved Analytic Model for Power System Fault Diagnosis and its Optimal Solution Calculation,2018,"['Power system', 'Fault diagnosis', 'Analytic model', 'Multi-objective optimization', 'Immune memory']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"When a fault occurs in a power system, the existing analytic models for the power system fault diagnosis could generate multiple solutions under the condition of one or more protective relays (PRs) and/or circuit breakers (CBs) malfunctioning, and/or an alarm or alarms of these PRs and/or CBs failing. Therefore, this paper presents an improved analytic model addressing the above problem. It takes into account the interaction between the uncertainty involved with PR operation and CB tripping and the uncertainty of the alarm reception, which makes the analytic model more reasonable. In addition, the existing analytic models apply the penalty function method to deal with constraints, which is influenced by the artificial setting of the penalty factor. In order to avoid the penalty factor’s effects, this paper transforms constraints into an objective function, and then puts forward an improved immune clonal multi-objective optimization algorithm to solve the optimal solution. Finally, the cases of the power system fault diagnosis are served for demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model and method."
A generalized groundwater fluctuation model based on precipitation for estimating water table levels of deep unconfined aquifers,2018,"['Groundwater fluctuation', 'Deep water table aquifer', 'Water table level estimation', 'Cyber-physical system', 'Surveilling groundwater resources', 'Transfer function']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>A generalized water table fluctuation model based on precipitation was developed using a statistical conceptualization of unsaturated infiltration fluxes. A gamma distribution function was adopted as a transfer function due to its versatility in representing recharge rates with temporally dispersed infiltration fluxes, and a Laplace transformation was used to obtain an analytical solution. To prove the general applicability of the model, convergences with previous water table fluctuation models were shown as special cases. For validation, a few hypothetical cases were developed, where the applicability of the model to a wide range of unsaturated zone conditions was confirmed. For further validation, the model was applied to water table level estimations of three monitoring wells with considerably thick unsaturated zones on Jeju Island. The results show that the developed model represented the pattern of hydrographs from the two monitoring wells fairly well. The lag times from precipitation to recharge estimated from the developed system transfer function were found to agree with those from a conventional cross-correlation analysis. The developed model has the potential to be adopted for the hydraulic characterization of both saturated and unsaturated zones by being calibrated to actual data when extraneous and exogenous causes of water table fluctuation are limited. In addition, as it provides reference estimates, the model can be adopted as a tool for surveilling groundwater resources under hydraulically stressed conditions.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  A generalized estimation for water table fluctuation is developed. </LI> <LI>  The method can estimate water table level in unconfined aquifers of various depths. </LI> <LI>  To model unsaturated infiltration fluxes, a gamma distribution function is adopted. </LI> <LI>  The applicability of the model to deep water table aquifers is demonstrated. </LI> </UL> </P>"

Modified Differential Protection for Transformers in Wind Farms,2018,"['Distributed generation', 'Differential relay', 'Fault level', 'Transformer', 'Wind farm']",국문 초록 정보 없음,The liberalization of electricity market and environmental concerns are the major driving forces for the development of Distributed Generation (DG). The mode of grid-connected wind power generation is becoming popular and has matured as a reliable DG technology. The voltage generated by the wind generator is stepped up to the higher voltage by the transformers before connecting to the grid. Operating algorithm of the differential relays for transformer protection used in the wind farms need to be modified to take care of the dynamic nature of fault current caused by the intermittent nature of the wind power. An algorithm for the differential relay is proposed in which dual slope characteristics are adjusted with varying fault level situation according to the wind generator in service as well as with the wind speed. A case study conducted for a typical wind farm shows that the proposed method avoids mal-operation of the differential relay in varying wind power conditions.

Development of an easy-to-handle murine model for the characterization of radiation-induced gross and molecular changes in skin,2018,"['Radiation', 'Wound and injuries', 'Skin', 'Mice']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background Radiation-induced skin injury is a dose-limiting complication of radiotherapy. To investigate this problem and to develop a framework for making decisions on treatment and dose prescription, a murine model of radiation-induced skin injury was developed.Methods The dorsal skin of the mice was isolated, and irradiation was applied at single doses of 15, 30, and 50 Gy. The mice were followed for 12 weeks with serial photography and laser Doppler analysis. Sequential skin biopsy samples were obtained and subjected to a histological analysis, immunostaining against transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and Western blotting with Wnt-3 and β-catenin. Increases in the levels of TGF-β, Wnt, and β-catenin were detected after irradiation.Results All tested radiation doses caused progressive dermal thickening and fibrosis. The cause of this process, however, may not be radiation alone, as the natural course of wound healing may elicit a similar response. The latent appearance of molecular and histological markers that induce fibrosis in the 15 Gy group without causing apparent gross skin injuries indicates that 15 Gy is an appropriate dose for characterizing the effects of chronic irradiation alone. Thus, this model best mimics the patterns of injury that occur in human subjects.Conclusions This animal model can be used to elucidate the gross and molecular changes that occur in radiation-induced skin injury and provides an effective platform for studying this adverse effect without complicating the process of wound healing."
"Trend Forecast for Drugstores by using FMD Analysis, Wavelet-based Clustering, and a State-space Model",2018,"['Trend forecast', 'Time series data', 'Clustering', 'Wavelet Transform', 'State-space model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This research forecasts order trends for drugstores based on order history datasets. Frequency–monetary–distance (FMD) analysis, merchandise clustering, and a modified model selection criterion are used to improve forecast accuracy. FMD analysis is a store classification method that is used for considering accessibility to the store as one of its characteristics. Merchandise clustering uses a wavelet transform aimed at finding the common order trends in products from the order history. The modified model selection criterion is intended to provide forecast models that reduce either underestimated or overestimated errors. Our verification results show that FMD analysis provides forecasts with fewer errors for most products, compared to the classification method without considering accessibility. Wavelet-based clustering reduces forecast errors depending on mother wavelets. The modified model selection criterion also reduces underestimated or overestimated errors."

It is assumed that accidents occur according to a Poisson point process, and each accident is accompanied by a claim developmental mark that contains the reporting time, the settlement time, and the size of (possibly multiple) payments between these two times. Under exponential reporting and settlement delays, we show that our model can be represented as a Markovian risk process with countably infinite number of states. This can in turn be transformed to an equivalent fluid flow model when the payments are phase-type distributed. As a result, classical measures such as ruin probability or more generally the Gerber–Shiu expected discounted penalty function follow directly. The joint Laplace transform and the pairwise joint moments involving the ruin time and the aggregate payments of different types (with and without claim settlement) are further derived. Numerical illustrations are given at the end, including the use of a real insurance dataset.</P>"

Rough set model based feature selection for mixed-type data with feature space decomposition,2018,"['Feature selection', 'Mixed-type data', 'Classification', 'Rough set model', 'Feature space decomposition']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Feature selection plays an important role in the classification problems associated with expert and intelligent systems. The central idea behind feature selection is to identify important input features in order to reduce the dimensionality of the input space while maintaining or improving classification performance. Traditional feature selection approaches were designed to handle either categorical or numerical features, but not the mix of both that often arises in real datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm for classifying mixed-type data, based on a rough set model, called feature selection for mixed-type data with feature space decomposition (FSMSD). This can handle both categorical and numerical features by utilizing rough set theory with a heterogeneous Euclidean-overlap metric, and can be applied to mixed-type data. It also uses feature space decomposition to preserve the properties of multi-valued categorical features, thereby reducing information loss and preserving the features’ physical meaning. The proposed algorithm was compared with four benchmark methods using real mixed-type datasets and biomedical datasets, and its performance was promising, indicating that it will be helpful to users of expert and intelligent systems.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Interpretability of the feature selection for mixed-type data is increased. </LI> <LI>  Any transforming procedure is not needed on categorical and numerical features. </LI> <LI>  FSMSD selects features that are not biased by any data-type. </LI> <LI>  FSMSD and benchmark methods are compared with 15 mixed-type data. </LI> </UL> </P>"

Productivity growth has been rapid and capacity has been expanded by very high levels of investment. The commercial banking sector has also grown rapidly and become diversified. The chinese banking system has progressed from a one bank system to a four bank system in state banking since the start of reforms in 1978, and then transformed into another system with dozens of banks since the 1990s to a system with hundreds of different types of banks. The banks dominate the Chinese financial system, providing about three fifths of total credit to the private sector. And the chinese banking system is fairly concentrated, with five banks splitting almost half the total loan market . Many economists believe that the financial system of China plays a more critical role in fueling expansion in China than foreign commerce does. There is far less understanding of China's financial system than western systems and it has proven harder to analyze since it is highly opaque, evolving rapidly as the regulation, structure, and operation of finance changes. But many researchers who study it believe the financial system may be the main vulnerability for fast economic development in china. An equally respected position is that the financial system is adapting effectively to China's more developed international status. We suggest the existence of a stable, short and long-run relationship between key indicators of banking industry (Profit-Making Ability, Risk Status and Credit Quality) and property market. The direction of influence goes from property market to banking industry rather than the other way around. Furthermore, banking industry appears to be mainly supply and demand-driven through different ways. Thus, the fiscal policy, monetary policy, financial policy, structural adjustment, and prudential regulation by banks can guard against risk control of the property market to banking sector swings, unlike that of other research objectives."
Osteogenic Nanoﬁbrous Coated Titanium Implant Results in Enhanced Osseointegration: In Vivo Preliminary Study in a Rabbit Model,2018,"['Osteogenic nanoﬁbrous coating', 'Osseointegration', 'Titanium implant']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A titanium implant surface when coated with biodegradable, highly porous, osteogenic nanoﬁbrous coating has shown enhanced intrinsic osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties. This coating mimics extracellular matrix resulting in differentiation of stem cells present in the peri-implant niche to osteoblast and hence results in enhanced osseointegration of the implant. The osteogenic nanoﬁbrous coating (ONFC) consists of poly-caprolactone, gelatin, nano- sized hydroxyapatite, dexamethasone, ascorbic acid and beta-glycerophosphate. ONFC exhibits optimum mechanical properties to support mesenchymal stem cells and steer their osteogenic differentiation. ONFC was subjected to various characterization tests like scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffractometry, thermal degradation, biomineralization, mechanical properties, wettability and proliferation assay. In pre-clinical animal trials, the coated implant showed enhanced new bone formation when placed in the tibia of rabbit. This novel approach toward implant bone integration holds signiﬁcant promise for its easy and economical coating thus marking the beginning of new era of electrospun osteogenic nanoﬁbrous coated bone implants."
Therapeutic time window for the effects of erythropoietin on astrogliosis and neurite outgrowth in an in vitro model of spinal cord injury,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Background:The objective of this study was to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms and the therapeutic time window for preventing astrogliosis with erythropoietin (EPO) treatment after in vitro modeled spinal cord injury (SCI).Methods:Cultured rat spinal cord astrocytes were treated with kainate and scratching to generate an in vitro model of SCI. EPO (100U/mL or 300U/mL) was added immediately or 2, 4, or 8 hours after injury. Some cultures were also treated with AG490, an inhibitor of the EPO-EPO receptor (EpoR) pathway mediator Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). To evaluate neurite extension, rat embryonic spinal cord neurons were seeded onto astrocyte cultures and treated with EPO immediately after injury in the presence or absence of anti-EpoR antibody.Results:EPO treatment at up to 8 hours after injury reduced the expression of axonal growth inhibiting molecules (glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan), cytoskeletal regulatory proteins (Rho-associated protein kinase and ephephrin A4), and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta, and phosphorylated-Smad3) in a dosedependent manner (P<.001). Most effects peaked with EPO treatment 2-4hours after injury. Additionally, EPO treatment up to 4 hours after injury promoted expression of the EpoR (>2-fold) and JAK2 (>3-fold) in a dose-dependent manner (P<.001), whereas co-treatment with AG490 precluded these effects (P<.001). EPO treatment up to 4hours after injury also enhanced axonal b-III tubulin-immunoreactivity (>12-fold), and this effect was precluded by co-treatment with an anti-EpoR antibody (P<.001).Conclusions:EPO treatment within 8 hours after injury reduced astrogliosis, and EPO treatment within 4 hours promoted neurite outgrowth. EPO therapy immediately after spinal cord injury may regulate glia to generate an environment permissive of axonal regeneration.</P>"

As an attempt in that direction, this paper proposes a transition from 'belief model' to 'adventure model'. Whitehead describes the stages of religious evolution as four steps : ritual, emotion, belief, and rationalization.In Whitehead's religious thought, religion evolves from the stage of belief to the stage of rationalization. We meet the world-consciousness in the stage of rationalization and pursue essential rightness. Because of the world-consciousness rises to the conception of an essential rightness of things. If so, we can not stay in the stage of belief. We need a faith structure of 'adventure model' that is appropriate for 'rationalization' stage.Religion, philosophy and science must have a common form of abstraction in order for them to be compatible. This article suggests a form of justification of retroduction(abduction). The 'adventure model' is formulated the structure of religious faith as application of it. This is not the dissolution of faith but the growth for better faith. The 'adventure model' was proposed as an attempt for religious transformation in the 21st century."

Furthermore, the Xi government (2013-present) has continued to maintain the state capitalism model in spite of some revisions and minor adjustments. Why did the Chinese development model transform into state capitalism? This study identiﬁes the strategies of the Chinese Communist Party-State leadership as core factors of China’s shift.

The world view and values transmitted by the story are also more diversified with the complexity of the global economic model and social model. In the eastern animation era represented by Japan, the story mode of new Japanese animators like Kishimoto Masashi, Mamoru Hosoda, Makoto Shinkai and so on gradually approached the real and complex world view. The storytelling of traditional animation companies such as Disney and DreamWorks in the West also diversify their role models to some extent. In traditional animation story telling, the pure good and evil have been gradually blurred in the story script, instead, because of the various reasons of the story, the roles of the characters are transformed.Methods When the actantial model is converted from A to B or from B to C, some elements such as the character modeling or color can also be changed. Some characters change in the shape of the body, some of the characters change in the props and clothes, and some others change in the color. In this study, the visual images of these roles are extracted and analyzed, so as to get the Enlightenment of all types of changes before and after the transformation.Result Based on the analysis of the size, complexity and brightness of each visual element, we can see from the above table that when the actantial model is transformed between the helpers and the opponents, the visual elements of the character are basically changing in opposite directions.Conclusion Basically helpers and opponents in the storytelling are stand in the opposite state, so we can get the reverse design inspiration when transforming character's actantial model has happened, such as the long and short hair, big and small in body size, color bright and dark and so on."

Based on this, we will examine the transformation of ‘Yuuki Onna’ in Japanese movies.First, ‘antagonistic narrative’ is a type of story telling in which a ‘negative character’ or a ‘quasi-human’, who shakes the balanced conditions of narrative stage, gets into trouble and ends up getting eradicated. ‘Story balance model’ is a methodology that reads the recovery process of the balanced conditions in the narrative stage according to sequential ㆍ cyclic repetition of ‘emergence - action - rejection – control’ mechanism. More specifically, the scenes that play this mechanism reify meanings that are left without a full explanation, or suggest direction for the reader to predict the next. This is also called a ‘node’ or a ‘core node’.Based on these preliminary discussions, this article examines the image of ‘Yuuki Onna’ and the storytelling structure of <Ghost Story> wrote by Rafukadio Han, who have had a massive influence on the cultural contents related to this fictional character, compared to that of Kobayashi Masaki’s <Ghost Story>(1964), <Dreams>(1990) by Akira Kurosawa and <Yuuki Onna>(2016) by Sugino Kiki. Due to the limitation of length, this research paper ended up analyzing only Japanese movies that has Yuuki Onna characters. In the future, I would like to expand the scope of the research to a wide range of antagonistic narratives and develop the methodology."

In the newly derived model, the acceleration of the robot body is used as the control input for the system, which provides the advantage of flexible selection of motors used for driving the robot. First, using Lagrangian dynamics and variable elimination, we derive a new type of mathematical model in which the acceleration of the robot body is the input to the balancing robot. Second, we propose a balancing control method based on the newly derived model. The structure of the controller adopts the LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) to determine the acceleration required for balancing. The obtained acceleration is converted to the velocity references of two wheels through integration and transformation. The resultant velocity references are followed through PI-type velocity controllers. Third, the implementation of the controller and the experimental results are presented.Two balancing robots are built, one of which adopts DC motors while the other uses step motors for actuation. Control experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and control method. The experimental results are illustrated through a phase portrait and the pitch angle of the robot and the control performance is analyzed. The proposed model and control method do not require the electrical coefficients of the adopted motor, thus offering great flexibility in motor selection."

Recently, North Korea's willingness to dialogue, reform and open is similar to the precedent in which the Myanmar military junta dismantled its ruling system and turned over transition period through general elections in 2010 and 2015 each. The so-called ‘Myanmar Model' refers to a country branded as a rogue state which has been under the international sanctions and pressure, and opening its political system and the market by choosing transformation. However, rapid changes in speed across the entire society after opening up are impossible because the political elite is only the leading role and implementation in the transition.In case of Myanmar, military culture has penetrated into society due to such a long-lasting military dictatorship, and even democratic bloc has become accustomed to authoritarian decision-making process. Furthermore, the ""reserved area"" of the old regime still exists in a deformed political structure that can not retrieve the interests of the military. Therefore there could not be achieved political development in term of qualification.North Korea also appears unlikely to achieve political and economic assessment in a short period of time, as civil society has not appeared due to its long dictatorship and very low economic development levels. Like Myanmar, North Korea is also likely to control the pace and direction of upcoming reforms and open, as the dictator or most powerful person chose to reform and open up. Therefore, if North Korea moves toward the 'Myanmar Model', there will be high expectations of new changes in the short term, but it could be delayed or stalled in the mid and long term."

In this approach, using the Poisson equation, a guided vector field is created by employing source and target images within a selected region at the first step. Next, the guided vector is used in generating the result image. We analyze the problem of reconstructing a two-dimensional function that approximates a set of desired gradients and a data term. The joined data and gradients are able to work like modifying the image gradients while staying close to the original image. Starting with this formulation, we have a screened Poisson equation known in physics. This equation leads to an efficient solution to the problem in FFT domain. It represents the spatial filters that solve the two-dimensional screened Poisson model and shows gradient scaling to be a well-defined sharpen filter that generalizes Laplace sharpening. We demonstrate the results using a discrete cosine transformation based this Poisson model."

Methods: Cirrhotic patients with non-hypervascular HBPI hypointense nodules were retrospectively analyzed if they were diagnosed as HCC and MR followed up longer than 1 year during the period from January 2010 to October 2016 with regular intervals of 3 to 6 months. Risk factors for transformation into hypervascular HCCs were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: Among the 103 non-hypervascular HBPI hypointense nodules meeting the inclusion criteria, transformation into hypervascular HCCs occurred in 44 tumors (42.7%). The median follow-up period was 24 months. Multivariate analysis revealed that hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were the two independent predictors of transformation into hypervascular HCCs (p=0.036 and p=0.041, respectively). Most tumors with hyperintensity on T2WI or DWI on the initial or follow-up MR were transformed into hypervascular HCCs within the first year. Among the 22 nodules (21.3%) showing a new change in dynamic phases during follow-up, 14 nodules (13.6%) showed malignant transformations. Conclusions: The transformation rates of HBPI hypointense nodules into hypervascular HCCs could be predicted according to the initial or serial MRI findings. (Gut Liver 2018;12:79-85)"

To resolve this problem, a model for prediction power only was developed, and the leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV)-forward selection method was applied to select the variables. In addition, the power transformation of Tukey’s Ladder of Powers was adopted to create linearity in the dependent and independent variables. The typhoon damage prediction function was developed for 22 districts with more than 16 datasets. The transformation factor λ, representing these 22 districts, was shown to vary according to the regional characteristics of each city and district.

The main advantages of proposed work include: (1) Discrete Analytical Fourier-Mellin Transform (DAFMT) and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are combined to extract the block features and detect the potential copy-move pairs; (2) The Euclidian distance is incorporated in the pixel variance to filter out the false potential copy-move pairs in the post-verification step. In addition to extracting the effective features of an image block, the DAMFT has the properties of rotation and scale invariance. Unlike the traditional lexicographic sorting method, LSH is robust to the degradations of Gaussian noise and JEPG compression. Because most of the false copy-move pairs locate closely to each other in the spatial domain or are in the homogeneous regions, the Euclidian distance and pixel variance are employed in the post-verification step. After evaluating the proposed method by the precision-recall-F1 model quantitatively based on the Image Manipulation Dataset (IMD) and Copy-Move Hard Dataset (CMHD), our method outperforms Emam et al.’s and Li et al.’s works in the recall and F1 aspects."

INNOVATIVE BUSINESS MODELS AND SUSTAINABILITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP: CASE OF THE RUSSIAN ECOPRENEURIAL FIRMS,2018,"['sustainability entrepreneurship', 'ecopreneurship', 'business models', 'recycling', 'customer value', 'customer disvalue', 'Russia']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Introduction  Environmental problems, especially waste problem are the responsibility of the state, first of all. But in the developed countries the flexibility of the utilization system is attached to small recycling firms – ecological entrepreneurs (ecopreneurs). At the present time, a typical situation in the sphere of waste management in Russia can be characterized by total absence or minimum organization of waste selective collection (less than 5%) and almost total absence of recycling companies (Korshenko et al., 2015). Recycling companies themselves have to create a raw material market and a sales market using innovative business models. Although the literature on the entrepreneurship states that there are good openings for the entrepreneurs due to the transformation to the “green” business, ecopreneurial practices are considered to be under-investigated. The most part of the literature is focused on the identification of well-established entrepreneurs but the topic of business models received little attention. This paper investigates the characteristics of ecological entrepreneurship business models in the recycling industry in Russia.  Theoretical Development  The relationship between entrepreneurship and sustainable development has been addressed by various streams of thought and literature such as social entrepreneurship, sustainable entrepreneurship, ecological entrepreneurship and institutional entrepreneurship (Schaltegger & Wagner, 2011). Schaper (2010) has argued that adopting a sustainable business framework may create new opportunities for entrepreneurs, including the reconfiguration of existing business models. So far, the literature on business models for sustainable entrepreneurship has received little attention (Jolink & Niesten, 2015). It need to be answered the following basic questions that shape the business model (Morris et al., 2005). (a) How and for whom will the firm create value? (b) What is the firm’s internal source of advantage and how will this provide the basis for its external positioning? (c) How will the firm make money, and how does this relate to the firm’s scope and size and time ambitions? Jolink and Niesten (2015) have opted for those ecopreneurs that operate in the processing and retail of organic food and beverages (eco-products) in the Netherlands. They define the ecopreneurial business model and specify four varieties of this business model, which consist of different combinations of environmental scope and a focus on the mass market and profitability. Jolink and Niesten (2015) assumed that the distinguishing factor of the ecopreneurial business model is that it transforms disvalue into value, thereby creating greater customer value for environmentally concerned consumers. But in the literature, ecological entrepreneurship is understood as a wide kind of goods and services: from the development and sale of resource and energy-saving technologies, recycling, to ecotourism, the production of organic food and other products and eco-restaurants. It can be assumed that the business models, and the mechanism of transformation of negative consumer value may differ depending on the sector in which ecopreneurship is carried out. Recycling is a very specific industry, since waste itself is the source of the consumer disvalue. Given all of the above, our research question sounds like: What are the features of business models of recycling firms? Research Design  Considering the research question, stage of the development of the theory of ecopreneurship, and importance of the context, we assume that case methodology are more suitable for this research. The unit of analysis – business model. Population was specific. That is Companies engaged in wastes recycling in the Primorye Territory, Russia. The sample is theoretical (nonrandom), includes the cases of two companies. Data sources include interview, documents, open sources. The interviews were subsequently coded in order to facilitate comparisons and to find a pattern or structure in the data. The data were triangulated by a variety of means according methodology of case study.  Result and Conclusion  The resulting business model descriptions show how business is done by the ecopreneur, and how, and for whom, the firms create value (Zott & Amit, 2007). The companies cases show that in the ecological entrepreneurship value creation can be related to what the consumer value as well as to what they don’t value. The wastes themselves are the source of the consumers disvalue. But in the case of wastes recycling the customers experiencing the disvalue and receiving the value transformed from it are quite different consumers. Abilities for solving the clients’ ecological issues due to the entrepreneurial thinking and social ideology developed as a result of the ecopreneurial practice (Jolink & Niesten, 2015) are the internal source of a firm advantages and the basis for the external positioning (Morris et al., 2005) of the recycling companies. According to Jolink and Niesten (2015) classification of business models of ecopreneurship, business models of companies combine the features of an income model and a subsistence model. So, we have drawn the following conclusions. The academic field of ecological entrepreneurship is only just developing. By combining the literature on ecological entrepreneurship with the empirical research on business models, we explore the mechanisms of value creation by green businesses, and make several contributions to the literature. First, we studied entrepreneurial practices in a specific and little explored form of ecopreneurship – in the recycling. Second, building on Jolink and Niestens’ (2015) schematic representation of replacing consumer disvalue by consumer value, we developed scheme of process of transformation of consumer value by the recycling companies. Thus, this study contributes to the conceptualization of the theory of ecological entrepreneurship."

The hybrid model for a very-short-term WPP (VSTWPP) is achieved through analytical data, multiple linear regressions and least square methods (MLR&LS). The data used in our hybrid model are based on the historical records of wind power from an offshore region. In this model, the WPP is achieved in four steps: 1) transforming historical data into ratios; 2) predicting the wind power using the ratios; 3) predicting rectification ratios by the total wind power; 4) predicting the wind power using the proposed rectification method. The proposed method includes one-step and multi-step predictions. The WPP is tested by applying different models, such as the autoregressive moving average (ARMA), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). The results of all these models confirmed the validity of the proposed hybrid model in terms of error as well as its effectiveness. Furthermore, forecasting errors are compared to depict a highly variable WPP, and the correlations between the actual and predicted wind powers are shown. Simulations are carried out to definitely prove the feasibility and excellent performance of the proposed method for the VSTWPP versus that of the SVM, ANN and ARMA models."
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RUSSIAN AND GLOBAL MARKETING MODELS ON THE RUSSIAN MARKET,2018,"['COC', 'Russian', 'global', 'marketing competencies and capabilities', 'marketing']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Introduction The goal of the current research is to conduct a comparative analysis of marketing models of Russian and global companies localized in Russia. Our research experience confirms an existence of a significant difference in the implementation of market orientation and in marketing activities of global companies compared to the local ones. The focus of the present research lies in the development and support mechanisms of customer oriented organizational culture as well as the role of marketing in decision making processes on all managerial levels. Literature review The attitude of top management to marketing changes consistently both in the developed and emerging markets (Webster, 1992; Webster, Malter, & Ganesan, 2005; Yuldasheva & Pisareva, 2015). Modern marketing is increasingly a part of the managerial and decision making system. It is being integrated into the system of company management through a diffusion of marketing competencies (Webster et al, 2005) becoming a locus of integration and coordination of inter-functional processes in a service dominating business model (Vargo & Lush, 2004). Literature review makes it possible to highlight several most important directions of research that formed the basis for our comparative analysis of marketing models. Customer oriented culture (COC) The literature review allows differentiating between three approaches to the definition of customer orientation (CO): ? CO as an element of market orientation (Narver & Slater, 1990; Kohli & Jaworski, 1990) and in some cases its synonym; ? CO as behavioral aspect of sales or frontline personal (Saxe & Weitz, 1982). In this case an operational level of CO implementation is considered; ? CO as an advanced level of organizational culture development that has been shaped under enhancing of marketing influence on the decision making processes in the companies on all managerial levels (Deshpande & Webster, 1989). Thus, CO can be considered as an organizational culture creating new values for the personnel and transforming all business processes in terms of customer centricity to achieve higher customer satisfaction, retention and loyalty. The research of COC should be conducted from the perspective of CO settings (values) and from the perspective of CO implementation. Marketing competencies and capabilities Dissemination of COC influences on the development of marketing capabilities and competencies in the organizational learning process which involves all departments and all managerial levels. In this context marketing capabilities can be understood as integrative processes whereby the collective knowledge, skills, and resources of a firm are applied to the market-related needs of the business (Day, 1994; Vorhies, 1998). As a result of repetitive actions, more or less sustainable patterns of behavior arise (Grant, 1991). These patterns determine the type of the customer oriented business models in which the marketing models is one of the sub elements reflecting the role and the status of marketing in decision making process. The previous research results (Webster, 1992; Webster et al, 2005; Wiersema, 2013) showed the evolutionary changes of marketing in corporations on three levels of management – corporate, business and operational (functional) (Hofer & Schendel, 1978). Taking into account these three strategy levels, Webster (1992) suggests to consider marketing as culture (on the corporate level), as strategy (on the strategic business unit level) and as tactics (on the functional level). In this research, we compare the changes in marketing models on the different managerial levels in Russian and global companies under the pressure of emerging COC. Theoretical model and research design We understand the marketing models as consisting of COC and a set of marketing competencies and capabilities on the different managerial levels. COC creates the values and the behavioral norms in the company which are transformed in the customer oriented business processes setting. COC has to bring not just CO values but CO business processes supported by the control and motivation system. In this context, COC establishment and implementation should be considered. COC establishment is based on the understanding of CO importance by top management. COC implementation leads to the dissemination of CO values and transforming them into CO behavior of personnel. That is why the measuring scales of market orientation (MARCOR: Kohli & Jaworski, 1993) and CO (MORTN: Deshpande & Farley, 1998; SOCO: Saxe & Weitz, 1982) include the statements about the regular using or the effective performance of CO business processes. To investigate the corporate marketing competence dispersion, we also use the concept of intangible marketing assets (Webster et al, 2005) (fig.1). Research goal and proposition The goal of this research is description and comparative analysis of marketing models of companies localized in Russia, which are shaped differntly under the influence of COC development. We suppose that dissemination of COC in the company changes the role and status of marketing in the managerial system as well as the level of its influence on decision making processes. Two groups of companies are compared: ? large Russian companies possessing brands well-known in Russia;? global companies (their units) localized in Russia and possessing globally known brands. As this research is an exploratory one, a preliminary proposition was formulated: the process of marketing model changing in Russian and global companies proceeds in a different way. The typical level of COC development and marketing influence on decision making processes on all managerial levels in large Russian companies is lower than in the global companies localized in Russia. Sample This research is making use of the database of 40 semi-structured interviews with company managers (Trefilova, 2017; Yuldasheva & Pisareva, 2015). Out of these, 5 interviews with large Russian companies and 8 interviews with daughter companies of global corporations were selected. To increase the size of the sample of Russian companies, 5 interviews with managers were organized additionally. Thus, the total sample consisted of 18 interviews (10 Russian and 8 global companies) The interview guide consisted of six open questions. Data analysis and research results The primary analysis of interviews was conducted applying the techniques of content analysis and meanings compaction (Ilyin, 2006). The primary content analysis showed a significant differentiation between the respondents’ answers to all questions, especially inside the sub-set of Russian companies. The further analysis of the qualitative research data was carried out according to the grounded theory methodology applying the procedures of data conceptualization, concept categorization, identifying the category attributes and ways to measure them (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). The results of the comparative analysis of the marketing models of Russian and global companies allowed formulating several conclusions. The managers of Russian and global companies show different understanding of COC. The global companies promote service proposition and sustainable consumption models while Russian companies continue to sell products and try to keep quality and price on the competitive level. We labeled this phenomenon as “the fight between product and service dominant logic”. The gap between the declared CO values and their implementation in business processes in Russian companies is higher than in global ones. We connect it with lower quality of management in Russian companies as well as low level of market competition encountered by large companies. Global companies are aimed at supporting long-term brand value to a much higher extent than Russian companies. All business processes on the business and functional levels are subordinated to providing long-term brand value. Global companies are characterized by a stronger COC, which is supported not only by the service standards but also by the customer-centric motivation of the whole staff. Moreover, internal and HR branding carried out by the HR department are well developed in the global companies. It reveals a much more developed personnel management function than in the Russian companies. Up to now, it is believed in the Russian companies that customer centricity can be ensured just by the work of marketing and sales personnel. The research confirmed also the results received by Webster et al (2005) and Wiersema (2013) on the dispersion of marketing competencies on the business and corporate levels, on the growing importance of marketing performance measurement and on the growth of the marketing’s strategic role, especially for companies involved in innovations. As for the dominating marketing strategy, most informants use both attraction and retention strategies simultaneously. An interesting finding turned out to be that many informants differentiate between the models of product marketing and relationship marketing. The latter is understood as the interaction and value co-creation using a digital platform. Our research showed that on the functional level (marketing department level) the dominating share of companies develop competencies and capabilities in the sphere of marketing communication and customer involvement. Such marketing competencies as product management (including price management), customer relationship management or key account management have been transferred to the inter-functional (business) level. Channel management is carried out by the sales departments. The major finding is the confirmation of marketing knowledge equity formation in the most advanced companies (Yuldasheva, Pisareva & Khalikov, 2016). Marketing knowledge equity mostly consists of market and customer needs knowledge, ability to forecast market changes and customer reactions. Conclusion Thus, the proposition about the different ways of marketing model changing and a lower level of COC and lower influence of marketing in the decision making processes on all levels of the large Russian companies compared to the global companies is confirmed. However, a trend is apparent to enhance the strategic influence of marketing on the decision making processes in the large Russian companies. It requires the continuation of a longitudinal research. In whole, the comparative analysis of the Russian and global companies marketing models showed that in spite of the existence of some peculiarities mainly connected with the backwardness of Russian companies compared to foreign ones (particularly, there is a lower customer centricity and lower management quality), the Russian marketing replicates the development of the Western marketing, copying its models and practices."
Penalized variable selection for accelerated failure time models,2018,"['AFT model', 'LASSO', 'penalized likelihood', 'SCAD', 'variable selection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The accelerated failure time (AFT) model is a linear model under the log-transformation of survival time that has been introduced as a useful alternative to the proportional hazards (PH) model. In this paper we propose variable-selection procedures of fixed effects in a parametric AFT model using penalized likelihood approaches. We use three popular penalty functions, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), adaptive LASSO and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD). With these procedures we can select important variables and estimate the fixed effects at the same time. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using simulation studies, including the investigation of impact of misspecifying the assumed distribution. The proposed method is illustrated with a primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) data set."

In Tokyo Story (1953), an old couple goes up to Tokyo to see their children living there, and it draws the fragmentary ideas about the family in which the distance between the old couple and their children gradually increases like the distance between the spaces they live in the itinerary through the continuum of everyday words and actions.

It came to the fore, receiving a favorable evaluation, so that it can be called its remake, reproduced the original work as it was.There is a difference in time and space between the two films, the modern times and the contemporary times. Accordingly, there are changes in the characters’ family members, in lifestyle and in their consciousness. And yet, the way the family is defined resembles so that the difference is meaningless.The nature of the family is political, constructed from its imagery, which has always been believed to exist or is expected to exist, instead of natural or conclusive, simply judging from the external reality. Despite the diversification of the family model is in progress, the method of defining an ideal family remains in modern times. Such a fantasy of the family rather attributes social problems to its transformation. It seems that the family should be re-defined, like the world changes in the flow of time."

Essentially, the objective function seeks to optimize a full data transformation matrix along with the learning of a linear parametric model.

The proposed method improves the existing means via an optimal data transformation rather than that based on the diagonal, random and ad-hoc settings. This optimal transformation stretches beyond the fixed settings of known optimization methods.

Generalized two-field <i>α</i>-attractor models from the hyperbolic triply-punctured sphere,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>We study generalized two-field <I>α</I>-attractor models whose rescaled scalar manifold is the triply-punctured sphere endowed with its complete hyperbolic metric, whose underlying complex manifold is the modular curve  Y ( 2 ) . Using an explicit embedding into the end compactification, we compute solutions of the cosmological evolution equations for a few globally well-behaved scalar potentials, displaying particular trajectories with inflationary behavior as well as more general cosmological trajectories of surprising complexity. In such models, the orientation-preserving isometry group of the scalar manifold is isomorphic with the permutation group on three elements, acting on  Y ( 2 )  as the group of anharmonic transformations. When the scalar potential is preserved by this action, <I>α</I>-attractor models of this type provide a geometric description of two-field “modular invariant <I>j</I>-models” in terms of gravity coupled to a non-linear sigma model with topologically non-trivial target and with a finite (as opposed to discrete but infinite) group of symmetries. The precise relation between the two perspectives is provided by the elliptic modular function <I>λ</I>, which can be viewed as a field redefinition that eliminates almost all of the countably infinite unphysical ambiguity present in the Poincaré half-plane description of such models.</P>"
Effect of phase transformations on buckling behavior of subducting slab and tectonic implication,2018,"['슬랩 좌굴', '수치 모델', '상전이', '섭입대', 'slab buckling', 'numerical model', 'phase transformation', 'subduction zone']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The apparent thickening of the subducting slab in the shallow lower mantle has been attributed to slab buckling. However, the scaling laws have not been quantitatively evaluated for the buckling behavior of the subducting slab when phase transformations are considered. Thus, two-dimensional dynamic subduction experiments are formulated to evaluate the effect of phase transformations on the buckling behavior of the subducting slab. The model calculations show that the phase transformation from olivine to wadsleyite at a depth of 410 km plays an important role in the development of slab buckling; increased slab pull due to the endothermic phase transformation accelerates slab sinking in the upper mantle and the subducting slab reaches the lower mantle in a shorter time than that of the experiments without the phase transformation. However, the phase transformation from ringwoodite to perovskite plus magnesiowüstite at a depth of 660 km retards slab sinking into the lower mantle and the subducting slab tends to be accumulated in the transformation (transition) zone. Buckling analyses show that the scaling laws predict the buckling amplitude and period of the subducting slab with small relative errors even if the phase transformations are considered. The universal phenomenon of the slab buckling can explain apparent slab thickening in the shallow lower mantle and transformation zone under the subduction zones such as Java-Sunda and Northeast Japan. In addition, the buckling behavior of the subducting slab may be related to the periodic compressions and extensions in the Cretaceous Gyeongsang basin."
Learning-Based Just-Noticeable-Quantization- Distortion Modeling for Perceptual Video Coding,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Conventional predictive video coding-based approaches are reaching the limit of their potential coding efficiency improvements, because of severely increasing computation complexity. As an alternative approach, perceptual video coding (PVC) has attempted to achieve high coding efficiency by eliminating perceptual redundancy, using just-noticeable-distortion (JND) directed PVC. The previous JNDs were modeled by adding white Gaussian noise or specific signal patterns into the original images, which were not appropriate in finding JND thresholds due to distortion with energy reduction. In this paper, we present a novel discrete cosine transform-based energy-reduced JND model, called ERJND, that is more suitable for JND-based PVC schemes. Then, the proposed ERJND model is extended to two learning-based just-noticeable-quantization-distortion (JNQD) models as preprocessing that can be applied for perceptual video coding. The two JNQD models can automatically adjust JND levels based on given quantization step sizes. One of the two JNQD models, called LR-JNQD, is based on linear regression and determines the model parameter for JNQD based on extracted handcraft features. The other JNQD model is based on a convolution neural network (CNN), called CNN-JNQD. To our best knowledge, our paper is the first approach to automatically adjust JND levels according to quantization step sizes for preprocessing the input to video encoders. In experiments, both the LR-JNQD and CNN-JNQD models were applied to high efficiency video coding (HEVC) and yielded maximum (average) bitrate reductions of 38.51% (10.38%) and 67.88% (24.91%), respectively, with little subjective video quality degradation, compared with the input without preprocessing applied.</P>"

It enriches the conceptual models of organizational silence and transformational leadership to enhance organizational performance and promote better organizational development.Based on relevant theoretical research, this study puts forward research hypotheses and establishes a research model. This study surveyed Chinese SMEs employees, and used SPSS23.0 and AMOS23.0 to analyze the data. This study used correlation analysis and hierarchical regression analysis to verify the hypotheses.The results proved that organizational silence had a significant effect on organizational citizenship behavior. In which, acquiescent silence and defensive silence had negative significant effects on organizational citizenship behavior, and pro-social silence had a positive significant effect on organizational citizenship behavior. Psychological contract played a part of moderating role among the above effect relationships. In addition, among of transformational leadership dimensions, charisma, individualized consideration and inspirational motivation had positive significant effects on organizational citizenship behavior, but intellectual stimulation had no significant effect on organizational citizenship behavior. Psychological contract also played a part of moderating role among the above effect relationships.Organizations should establish more effective communication channels to avoid the negative effects of organizational silence. Organizations should enhance individualized consideration and inspirational motivation to improve the positive effect of transformational leadership on organizational citizenship behavior. In addition, employees who maintain a high level of psychological contract may have a strong sense of belonging that counteracts the negative effect of organizational silence and the positive effect of transformational leadership"

Unified Theory for Recovery of Sparse Signals in a General Transform Domain,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Compressed sensing is provided a data-acquisition paradigm for sparse signals. Remarkably, it has been shown that the practical algorithms provide robust recovery from noisy linear measurements acquired at a near optimal sampling rate. In many real-world applications, a signal of interest is typically sparse not in the canonical basis but in a certain transform domain, such as wavelets or the finite difference. The theory of compressed sensing was extended to the analysis sparsity model, but known extensions are limited to the specific choices of sensing matrix and sparsifying transform. In this paper, we propose a unified theory for robust recovery of sparse signals in a general transform domain by convex programming. In particular, our results apply to the general acquisition and sparsity models and show how the number of measurements for recovery depends on properties of measurement and sparsifying transforms. Moreover, we also provide extensions of our results to the scenarios where the atoms in the transform have varying incoherence parameters and the unknown signal exhibits a structured sparsity pattern. In particular, for the partial Fourier recovery of sparse signals over a circulant transform, our main results suggest a uniformly random sampling. Numerical results demonstrate that the variable density random sampling by our main results provides a superior recovery performance over the known sampling strategies.</P>"

When atopic dermatitis was induced, the transcription factors (GATA-3, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γ T [RORγT]) and cytokines (interleukin-4 [IL-4], IL-17) of Th2 and Th17 cells were overexpressed at the transcriptional level, and they significantly decreased with oral administration of β-1,3/1,6-glucan and L. plantarum LM1004. In addition, β-1,3/1,6-glucan and L. plantarum LM1004 were shown to modulate the immune balance by increasing the expression of Th1 and Treg transcription (T-bet, forkhead box p3 [Foxp3]) and cytokines (interferon-γ [IFN-γ], transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β]). Galectin-9 and filaggrin were significantly lower in the atopic dermatitis–induced group and significantly higher in the β-1,3/1,6-glucan-treated group. In contrast, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) was highest in the atopic dermatitis–induced group, while mice that were orally administered β-1,3/1,6-glucan and L. plantarum LM1004 showed similar TSLP levels to the control group. These results indicate that β-1,3/1,6-glucan and L. plantarum LM1004 have immunomodulatory effects and atopic dermatitis improvement effects in an animal model of atopic dermatitis. Therefore, it is expected that β-1,3/1,6-glucan and L. plantarum LM1004 can be used as natural materials in the treatment of atopic dermatitis."
Red Ginseng Oil Inhibits TPA-Induced Transformation of Skin Epidermal JB6 Cells,2018,"['AP-1', 'JB6 P+ cells', 'neoplastic transformation', 'NF-κB', 'red ginseng oil']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Red ginseng oil (RGO) has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activity. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of RGO on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-stimulated neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells. RGO pretreatment abolished the transformation of JB6 P+ cells challenged by TPA. RGO suppressed the transactivation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factors as well as protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and Bcl-2 in the TPA-treated cells. Additionally, TPA-induced phosphorylations of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase 2, c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β were downregulated in the presence of RGO. Furthermore, RGO induced the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, and effectively blocked the overproduction of TPA-induced reactive oxygen species. These results suggest that RGO exerts a potent chemopreventive activity in skin cell model."
Bitcoin Distribution in the Age of Digital Transformation: Dual-path Approach,2018,"['Bitcoin Distribution', 'Altcoin', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Retail Payment', 'Adoption Behavior', 'PLS.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose – The potential use of cryptocurrencies in a retail environment proposes a rapid shift from the traditional financial system. Nakamoto(2008) defines Bitcoin as an open source alt-coin based on the blockchain technology. Luther(2016) insists that the new technology will be widely adopted for the digital payment processes. However, the use of Bitcoin is in the real world is still sparse. Despite the growing attention and purported benefits, it is doubtful whether the Bitcoin will be eagerly accepted by ordinary consumers in the mainstream market. To answer this question, this paper develops a causal model that has a dual path to explain the motivation to adopt Bitcoin. According to Glaser, Zimmermann, Haferkorn, Weber, and Siering(2014), Bitcoin is both an asset and a currency at the same time. In summary, the attitude towards Bitcoin may vary depending on whether the fin-tech product is viewed as an asset or as a currency. Based on the arguments, we propose that asset attitude and currency attitude will give influence to consumers’ intention to adopt Bitcoin.Research design, data, and methodology – Quantitative data collection is conducted from a Bitcoin SIG(special interest group) working in an internet community. As a result, 192 respondents who know Bitcoin completed the survey. To analyze the causal relations in the research model, PLS-SEM(partial least squares structural equation modeling) method is used.Also, reliability and validity of measures are tested by performing Cronbach’s alpha test, Fornell-Larcker test and confirmatory factor test.Results – Our test results show that every hypothesis is supported except the influence of perceived ease of use. In addition, we find that the relationships between constructs are different between the high innovative group and low innovative group.Conclusions – We provide evidence that asset attitude and currency attitude are key antecedents of Bitcoin adoption."

During the chlorination of MeP-spiked waters without Br<SUP>−</SUP>, MeP was transformed into mono-Cl-MeP and di-Cl-MeP with apparent second-order rate constants (<I>k</I> <SUB>app</SUB>) of 64M<SUP>−1</SUP> s<SUP>−1</SUP> and 243M<SUP>−1</SUP> s<SUP>−1</SUP> at pH7, respectively, while further chlorination of di-Cl-MeP was relatively slower (<I>k</I> <SUB>app</SUB> =1.3M<SUP>−1</SUP> s<SUP>−1</SUP> at pH7). With increasing Br<SUP>−</SUP> concentration, brominated MePs, such as mono-Br-MeP, Br-Cl-MeP, and di-Br-MeP, became major transformation products. The di-halogenated MePs (di-Cl-MeP, Br,Cl-MeP, and di-Br-MeP) showed relatively low reactivity to chlorine at pH7 (<I>k</I> <SUB>app</SUB> =1.3–4.6M<SUP>−1</SUP> s<SUP>−1</SUP>) and bromine (<I>k</I> <SUB>app</SUB> =32–71M<SUP>−1</SUP> s<SUP>−1</SUP>), which explains the observed high stability of di-halogenated MePs in chlorinated waters. With increasing pH from 7 to 8.5, the transformation of di-halogenated MePs was further slowed due to the decreasing reactivity of di-MePs to chlorine. The formation of the di-halogenated MePs and their further transformation become considerably faster at Br<SUP>−</SUP> concentrations higher than 0.5μM (40μg/L). Nonetheless, the accelerating effect of Br<SUP>−</SUP> diminishes in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) extract (Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA)) due to a more rapid consumption of bromine by DOM than chlorine. The effect of Br<SUP>−</SUP> on the fate of MeP was less in the tested real water matrices, possibly due to a more rapid bromine consumption by the real water DOM compared to SRHA. A kinetic model was developed based on the determined species-specific second-order rate constants for chlorination/bromination of MeP and its chlorinated and brominated MePs and the transformation pathway information, which could reasonably simulate the transformation of MePs during the chlorination of water in the presence of Br<SUP>−</SUP> and selected DOM.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Transformation kinetics and pathways of methylparaben during chlorination are studied. </LI> <LI>  Second-order rate constants for chlorine/bromine with methylparabens are reported. </LI> <LI>  Brominated methylparabens are dominant over chlorinated ones with increasing bromide. </LI> <LI>  Bromide effect on methylparaben transformation diminishes by dissolved organic matter. </LI> <LI>  The developed kinetic model can simulate the paraben transformation in chlorination. </LI> </UL> </P>   <P><B>Graphical abstract</B></P>   <P>[DISPLAY OMISSION]</P>"

The model was strictly validated by comparing the predictions with experimental measurements and the results found good agreement between them. The results showed that a transformation strain caused by LTT martensitic transformation introduced large compressive residual stresses (−500 MPa) into the weld zone and the quantities were closely related to the chemical dilution between welding layers. Simulation results revealed that the chemical dilution helped mitigate the large localized tensile residual stresses by modulating the phase transformation process and a single LTT layer was sufficient to generate high compression near the weld surface (~2.5 mm), which suggests a great importance for repair welding.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  A chemical dilution model was incorporated into thermal-metallurgical-mechanical model for residual stress prediction; </LI> <LI>  Chemical dilution reduces inter-layer stress buildup by modulating phase transformation; </LI> <LI>  One layer of Low-Transformation-Temperature (LTT) alloy is able to generate high compression around the weld surface; </LI> <LI>  The formation mechanism of residual stress in multi-pass LTT welds was clarified. </LI> </UL> </P>   <P><B>Graphical abstract</B></P>   <P>[DISPLAY OMISSION]</P>"
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND VALUE CO-CREATION: THE MOTIVATIONAL PROCESSES INVOLVED IN THE RELATIONSHIP,2018,"['transformational leadership', 'value co-creation', 'motivation', 'relationship', 'HLM']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"With the advent of globalization and the accompanying rapid changes in economic environments, firms have gradually transformed their mode of operations from one based on the traditional good-dominant logic to one based on service-dominant logic. The emergence of service-dominant logic has resulted in the development of value co-creation, which refers to the process through which firms, suppliers, and customers all become involved in the discovery and creation of product value and create added value through even and reasonable distribution. Drawing upon the SDT theory, the current study has the following three research objectives. First, the current study investigated the influence of transformational leadership on employee-based value co-creation and the impact of transformational leadership on employees’ intrinsic motivation to further enhance their value co-creation. Second, this study sought to understand the mediating mechanisms between transformational leadership and employee-based value co-creation; financial and non-financial variables were used as the mediators to explore whether the financial incentive affects employees’ intrinsic motivational process with regard to the transformational leadership that leads to employees’ intrinsic motivation. Third, positive psychological capital was used as a mediator to examine whether it mediates the relationship between the financial perspective and value co-creation. Fourth, self-concordance was also adopted to examine whether self-concordance mediates the relationship between the financial perspective and value co-creation. We collected 513 survey responses from 81 teams in firms from diverse industries in Taiwan. The present study makes the following contributions. First, previous research related to leadership behavior primarily focused on the influences of leadership behaviors on employee attitudes and behaviors. Only a few studies addressed the impact of leadership on value co-creation. Drawing on the self-determination theory to build our research framework, our study contributes to the field by investigating how transformational leadership stimulates employee-based value co-creation. Second, the present study investigated the psychological mechanisms involved in the motivational process in the context of the ways in which transformational leadership facilitates changes in employee behavior, particularly for employees’ intrinsic motivation. Third, the present study proved that financial and non-financial incentives respectively mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and positive psychological capital. Additionally, both financial and non-financial incentives mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and self-concordance. These results suggest that both financial and non-financial incentives could be effective ways for transformational leaders to intrinsically motivate their employees. These findings are valuable contributions to the leadership studies field. Fourth, the present study adopted hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to conduct a multi-level analysis of the relationship between transformational leadership and value co-creation."

In this study, the potential of ferrate(VI) to eliminate microcystins during drinking water treatment was assessed by investigating reaction kinetics, reaction sites, transformation products, and toxicity changes for the oxidation of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) as a representative microsystin. The investigations also included several substructural model compounds of MC-LR, such as cinnamic acid and sorbic acid, to elucidate the major transformation products and pathways of MC-LR and olefinic compounds. Second-order rate constants were determined in the pH range 6–10.4 for the reaction of ferrate(VI) with MC-LR and the model compounds. The kinetic data revealed that the olefinic double bonds in the Adda and Mdha residues of MC-LR were the primary ferrate(VI) reaction sites, while the phenyl or guanidine moiety was not the reaction site. This finding was supported by detection and identification of the MC-LR transformation products of double bond cleavage, with high peak abundance in the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the reaction of ferrate(VI) with cinnamic and sorbic acids formed the corresponding aldehydes and organic acids with near complete carbon mass balance, indicating the oxidative cleavage of the double bonds as the primary reaction pathway. A quantitative protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) binding assay for ferrate(VI)-treated MC-LR solutions showed that the MC-LR transformation products exhibited negligible PP2A binding activity compared to that of the parent MC-LR.

Therefore, a single winding bearingless flywheel motor (SWBFM) specially for flywheel energy storage system is introduced. For the control system of SWBFM, coupling between the torque and the suspension subsystems exists inevitably. It is necessary to build a reasonable radial force mathematical model to precisely control SWBFM. However, SWBFM has twelve independently controlled windings which leads to high-order matrix transformation and complex differential calculation in the process of mathematical modeling based on virtual displacement method. In this frame, a Maxwell tensor modeling method which is no need the detailed derivation and complex theoretical computation is present. Moreover, it possesses advantages of universality, accuracy, and directness. The fringing magnetic path is improved from straight and circular lines to elliptical line and the rationality of elliptical line is verified by virtual displacement theory according to electromagnetic torque characteristics. A correction function is taken to increase the model accuracy based on finite element analysis. Simulation and experimental results show that the control system of SWBFM with radial force mathematical model based on Maxwell tensor method is feasible and has high precision."

Although the transformed stress-strain plots show a linear relationship theoretically, they actually show a nonlinearity at both low and high values of strain of the test. This phenomenon indicates that the stress-strain curve is not a complete form of a hyperbola. So, if linear regression analyses for the transformed stress-strain plot are performed over a full range of strain of a test, error in the estimation of their linear equations is unavoidable depending on ranges of strain with non-linearity. In order to reduce such an error, a modified regression analysis method is proposed in this study, in which linear regression analyses for transformed stress-strain plots are performed over the entire range of strain except the range the non-linearity is shown around starting and ending of the test, and then the initial tangent modulus and ultimate deviator stresses are calculated. Isotropically consolidated-drained triaxial compression tests were performed on compacted weathered soil with a modified Proctor density to obtain their model parameters. The modified regression analyses for transformed stress-strain plots were performed and analyzed results are compared with results estimated by 2 points method (Duncan et al., 1980). As a result of analyses, initial tangent moduli are about 4.0% higher and ultimate deviator stresses are about 2.9% lower than those values estimated by Duncan’s 2 points method."

Tailored synthesis over these parameters is successfully applied for the production of nanocrystals with desired properties for specific applications. However, in order to obtain full control over the properties, the behavior of nanocrystals under external stimuli and application conditions needs to be understood. Herein, using Ag-NiP<SUB><I>x</I></SUB> nanocrystals as a model system, we investigate the structural evolution upon thermal treatment by <I>in situ</I> aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. A combination of real-time imaging with elemental analysis enables the observation of the transformation from a Ag-NiP<SUB><I>x</I></SUB> core-shell configuration to a Janus structure at the atomic scale. The transformation occurs through dewetting and crystallization of the NiP<SUB><I>x</I></SUB> shell and is accompanied by surface segregation of Ag. Further temperature increase leads to a complete sublimation of Ag and formation of individual Ni<SUB>12</SUB>P<SUB>5</SUB> nanocrystals. The transformation is rationalized by theoretical modeling based on density functional theory calculations. Our model suggests that the transformation is driven by changes of the surface energy of NiP<SUB><I>x</I></SUB> and the interfacial energy between NiP<SUB><I>x</I></SUB> and Ag. The direct observation of atomistic dynamics during thermal-treatment-induced structural modification will help to understand more complex transformations that are induced by aging over time or the interaction with a reactive gas phase in applications such as catalysis.</P>[FIG OMISSION]</BR>"

The role of transformational leadership is also examined. To identify the relationship between core team job characteristics and transformational leadership, an empirical survey was conducted through surveys of domestic distribution companies. Among the collected questionnaires, missing and insincere responses were excluded and 636 individuals of 107 teams were used for the SPSS 18 analysis. It was found that job meaningfulness was positively related to team creativity and transformational leadership also had a significant effect. Task feedback was shown to be an important factor on the motivation to perform tasks successfully. In the case of transformational leadership, this leadership style helped individuals overcome fear by providing support, sympathy, and consideration to create novel ideas. But, its effects were different on team creativity when it interacted with core job characteristics. Departments where creativity is highly emphasized within an organization are able to design job characteristics which fit the task at hand. Moreover, transformational leadership brings about different effects on team creativity when it interacts with job characteristics. The findings of this study suggest that organizations should consider characteristics of tasks and individuals as well when conducting education and training."

In this study, only one point measurement (small strain at small stress) using indentation test and uniaxial compressive strength determined by a standard Schmidt hammer are considered as input parameters to predict stress-strain response from zero strain/zero stress up to failure. Observations show good predictive capabilities of transformed stress-stress models for weak-to-strong (${\sigma}_c$ <100 MPa) heterogeneous carbonate rocks exhibiting small (< 0.5 %), intermediate (< 1 %) and large (> 1 %) axial strains."

First, constitutional reforms have been done in Finland through continual, step-by-step processes over long-term periods. Based on accumulated changes, Finland instituted a total-scale constitutional reform in 1999-2000. Second, the 2000 Constitution has turned the political system into a standardmode parliamentarism by reducing the Presidential power while strengthening the Eduskunta (Parliament) and PM, simultaneously. Third, Finland rewrote the constitutional chapter of fundamental rights as a whole in 1995, indicating a transformation of the modern constitutionalism into a contemporary (post-modern) constitutionalism which emphasizes the universal principle of human rights and ‘active’ duties of the state. Fourth, Finland introduced a national-level citizens’ initiative system through the constitutional amendment in 2012. A modest direct democratic mechanism has contributed to cultivating a more open and inclusive relationship between parliament and citizens. Providing a systemic analysis of constitutional reforms in Finland, the study examines their extensive implications on South Korean debates."

Each example we study from four viewpoints: conformal (Drinfeld) twists, closed string gravity backgrounds, open string parameters and proposed dual noncommutative (NC) gauge theory. Irrespective of whether the deformed background is a solution to supergravity or generalized supergravity, we show that the open string metric associated with each gravity background is undeformed AdS<SUB>5</SUB> with constant open string coupling and the NC structure Θ is directly related to the conformal twist. One novel feature is that Θ exhibits ‘holographic noncommutativity’: while it may exhibit non-trivial dependence on the holographic direction, its value everywhere in the bulk is uniquely determined by its value at the boundary, thus facilitating introduction of a dual NC gauge theory. We show that the divergence of the NC structure Θ is directly related to the unimodularity of the twist. We discuss the implementation of an outer automorphism of the conformal algebra as a coordinate transformation in the AdS bulk and discuss its implications for Yang–Baxter <I>σ</I>-models and self-T-duality based on fermionic T-duality.

The private military industry emerged in the early 1990s. Its underlying cause was the confluence of three momentous dynamics - the end of the Cold War and the vacuum this produced in the market of security, transformations in the nature of warfare, and the normative rise of privatization. In order to introduce MPFs(Military Provider Firms) into Korea, where in principle private citizens are prohibited to own a gun, unlike the United States, a special law should be enacted which allows them to possess weapons and fight in combat.

In addition, this study essentially considers the role of women in Cambodia’s rural development project. The initial step is to promote and to spread the Saemaul Undong(SMU) throughout Cambodia. The second step is to enhance the capacity of the civil servants and villagers for the self-improvement of Cambodia. The third step is to raise the income of household through increasing production and to build consciousness of the community. Based on the project, this study analyzes the current status of rural women and factors affecting to their participation in socio - economic activities. A survey is conducted to villagers and women in individual village.The results show that the pilot project focuses on bottom - up business promotion strategy. Differential support based on circumstances of each village bring out positive effects of village to raise the ownership of residents. From the self-evaluation of the project, it reports high scores in relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability. However, gender impact and environment impact are relatively weak. From Cambodia’s rural development project, this study suggests the appropriate and fitted model for Cambodian surroundings and the political supports to encourage the social and economic participation of rural women."
선진 기업의 디지털 트랜스포메이션 추진 동향과 시사점 - 4차산업혁명 시대의 비즈니스 모델을 구축해야 한다,2018,[],"■ 개요디지털 트랜스포메이션(Digital Transformation)은 ‘ICT를 활용해 새로운 솔루션 창출, 운영 혁신, 사업기반 재구축 등으로 경쟁력을 제고하고 신성장을 추구하는 활동’을 의미한다. 최근 4차 산업혁명 추세로 경쟁력 제고와 신사업 개발을 목적으로 디지털 기술을 활용해 사업과 경영 구조를 재편할 목적으로 실행을 가속화하고 있다. 기업 생존 연한이 점점 짧아지고 수익성 강화를 목적으로 디지털 기술을 활용해 제품과 운영 활동에 근본적인 변혁이 강하게 요청되고 있기 때문이다. 현재 디지털 트랜스포메이션은 첨단제조기술·ICT 등 기술 적용과 프로세스 효율화에서 더 나아가 비즈니스 모델 변혁과 생태계 구축까지 확장해 실행되고 있다. 여기서는 글로벌 전통 기업을 대상으로 디지털 트랜스포메이션의 추진 동향과 사례를 살펴보고, 이를 통해 우리나라 기업 경영전략과 정부 정책의 실행 방향과 과제를 시사점으로 제시한다.■ 선진 기업의 추진 동향과 사례디지털 트랜스포메이션의 추진 사례를 실행 영역에 기반해 <프로세스 효율화>, <비즈니스 모델 변혁>, < 생태계(ecosystem) 구축 >으로 구분해 살펴보았다.첫째, <프로세스 효율화>다. 이는 경쟁사보다 우수한 효율성 및 시장 적시성 제고를 목표로 외부까지 포함한 공급체인 전체의 비즈니스 프로세스 변혁을 말한다. 우선 제조와 관련된 직접 활동을 변혁하는 ‘스마트 팩토리(Smart Factory)’가 있다. 이는 현장(공장)에 사물인터넷(IoT), 빅데이터 등을 접목해 고객 니즈 대응력을 강화하고 생산성 향상을 도모하는 제조 공정의 디지털화 추구하는 것이다. GE의 ‘생각하는 공장’(Brilliant Factory), 지멘스의 사이버물리시스템(CPS)으로 전 가치사슬 관리의 디지털화 실현이 대표적이다. 다음으로 간접 활동 변혁으로서 ‘경영 관리 지능화‘가 진행되고 있다. 비용 절감, 외부 대응력 강화를 목적으로 단순 반복적인 비즈니스 프로세스를 자동화하거나 경영 환경 관련 자료 수집 및 영향도 분석을 자동화하는 것이다. RPA(Robotic Process Automation)를 활용한 월마트의 질문 응대 및 검색 자동화와 다우케미컬의 Advanced Analytics 팀 운영이 대표적인 사례이다둘째, <비즈니스 모델 변혁>이다. 제품과 서비스를 융합한 고객 니즈 맞춤형의 솔루션 개발을 통해 지속적이면서 고부가 수익 창출이 가능한 비즈니스 모델을 구축하는 것이다. 현재 최종 제품(제품, 서비스, 솔루션) 측면에서는 제품에 ICT를 적용하여 고기능화하는 것 뿐만 아니라 제품에 기반한 서비스 사업으로 이동하는 ‘제조업의 서비스화’가 진행되고 있다. 자사의 엔지니어링과 제조 활동의 노하우를 디지털 공간에서 구현하고 이를 서비스로 제공하는 사업 창출을 목적으로 한다. GE와 테트라팩의 원격 모니터링 서비스, 보쉬의 스마트 매뉴팩쳐링 소프트웨어 판매를 들 수 있다. 또다른 사례로 제품 판매후에도 지속적(recurring)인 수익 창출을 의미하는 ‘리커링 비즈니스’(recurring business)가 있다. 현재 구조조정후 회생에 전력하고 있는 일본의 소니, 도시바가 이를 핵심 전략으로 추진하고 있다.셋째, <생태계 구축>이다. 경쟁 기반의 외연을 확장하는 것으로서 외부 업체와의 협력 네트워크를 구축해 부족한 디지털 기술을 확보하고, 시장 주도권 강화를 목표로 한다. 4차산업혁명 진전으로 과거와 차원이 다른 기술과 경쟁자가 진입하면서 대기업이라 할지라도 단독 대응은 거의 불가능하고 외부 자원을 활용한 비유기적(inorganic) 성장전략이 불가피하다. 현재 생태계 구축은 ‘하이퍼 코피티션(Hyper-Coopetition) 확대‘와 ‘오픈 디지털 이노베이션(Open Digital Innovation) 강화‘ 두 방향으로 전개되고 있다. ‘하이퍼 코피티션’은 업종, 경쟁 여부에 상관없이 글로벌 협력업체, 사업파트너까지 포함한 수평 통합(Horizontal Integration)을 구축하는 전략이다. 가전업체의 아마존 인공지능 플랫폼을 활용한 스마트 가전 개발, 자동차 메이커들의 자율주행차 개발과 관련해 데이터 처리 기술을 지닌 엔비디아, 인텔과의 협력 등이 대표적이다. ‘오픈 디지털 이노베이션’은 디지털 기술 확보를 목적으로 외부 스타트업 및 연구기관 등 외부조직과의 협업을 통해 자사의 제품 및 비즈니스의 신속한 개발을 실현하는 것이다. 지멘스는 스타트업과의 협력 실행 조직인 Next47를 설립했고, 디어앤컴퍼니(Deere & Company)는 자율주행 로봇 이벤트 후원, 농업분야 스타트업에 지분 참여를 추진하고 있다.■ 시사점주요국 및 선진 기업들은 이미 4차산업혁명 대응을 위한 핵심역량을 강화할 목적으로 디지털 트랜스포메이션 전략에 가용한 모든 자원을 쏟아붓고 있다. 우리 정부와 기업은 이러한 변화에 대응함은 물론 경쟁 기반 강화 및 시장 주도권 확보 등을 위한 디지털 트랜스포메이션 전략을 적극 실행해야 한다. 첫째, 운영효율화와 사업개발을 동시에 고려한 투트랙 방식의 디지털 트랜스포메이션 대응이 시급하다. 둘째, 디지털 트랜스포메이션의 비전과 실행 대상(영역)을 명확히 설정해야 한다. 셋째, 비즈니스 모델 재편, 생태계 변혁에 필요한 ICT를 확보하고 특히 외부 역량을 적극 활용하는 전략 수립이 요청된다. 넷째, 디지털 트랜스포메이션을 기획하고, 실행을 전담할 전략 조직을 상시 운영해야 한다.",다국어 초록 정보 없음
Aging effects on chemical transformation and metal(loid) removal by entrapped nanoscale zero-valent iron for hydraulic fracturing wastewater treatment,2018,"['Nanoscale zero-valent iron', 'Alginate entrapment', 'Hydraulic fracturing', 'Aging effect', 'Chemical speciation', 'Metal/metalloid removal']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>In this study, alginate and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-alginate entrapped nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) was tested for structural evolution, chemical transformation, and metals/metalloids removal (Cu(II), Cr(VI), Zn(II), and As(V)) after 1–2month passivation in model saline wastewaters from hydraulic fracturing. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed successful prevention of Fe<SUP>0</SUP> corrosion by polymeric entrapment. Increasing ionic strength (<I>I</I>) from 0 to 4.10M (deionized water to Day-90 fracturing wastewater (FWW)) with prolonged aging time induced chemical instability of alginate due to dissociation of carboxyl groups and competition for hydrogen bonding with nZVI, which caused high Na (7.17%) and total organic carbon (24.6%) dissolution from PVA-alginate entrapped nZVI after 2-month immersion in Day-90 FWW. Compared to freshly-made beads, 2-month aging of PVA-alginate entrapped nZVI in Day-90 FWW promoted Cu(II) and Cr(VI) uptake in terms of the highest removal efficiency (84.2% and 70.8%), pseudo-second-order surface area-normalized rate coefficient <I>k</I> <SUB> <I>sa</I> </SUB> (2.09×10<SUP>−1</SUP> Lm<SUP>−2</SUP> h<SUP>−1</SUP> and 1.84×10<SUP>−1</SUP> Lm<SUP>−2</SUP> h<SUP>−1</SUP>), and Fe dissolution after 8-h reaction (13.9% and 8.45%).

The X-ray spectroscopic analysis and chemical speciation modelling demonstrated that the difference in metals/metalloids removal by entrapped nZVI after aging was attributed to distinctive removal mechanisms: (i) enhanced Cu(II) and Cr(VI) removal by nZVI reduction with accelerated electron transfer after pronounced dissolution of non-conductive polymeric immobilization matrix; (ii) suppressed Zn(II) and As(V) removal by nZVI adsorption due to restrained mass transfer after blockage of surface-active micropores.

The SEM was used to transform a number of correlated traffic variables into four independent latent traffic factors, and toestablish the interrelationships among the traffic variables and crash risks. The segmentation analysis based on K-means clusteringwas then conducted to investigate the main traffic factors affecting crash risks in various traffic regimes. It was found that: (a) Themeasurement equations in SEM can effectively account for the correlations among traffic variables by transforming numerouscorrelated traffic variables into several latent traffic variables; (b) The SEM can both capture the direct and indirect effects of trafficflow variables on crash risks. This promotes a better understanding how traffic conditions affect crash risks; (c) The SEM producesmore accurate estimates of crash risks than existing modeling technique. It can increase the crash prediction accuracy by an averageof 7.6% compared with the commonly used logistic regression; and (d) Segmentation analysis results suggested that the trafficfactors contributing to crash risks are various across different traffic regimes.

Novel adaptive reclosing scheme using wavelet transform in distribution system with battery energy storage system,2018,"['Adaptive reclosing', 'BESS', 'Distribution system', 'Fault clearance', 'Wavelet transform']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Most distribution systems are operated in an unbalanced state; hence, neutral currents can be generated by unbalanced currents in three-phase four-wire distribution systems. This paper proposes a novel adaptive reclosing scheme that uses the neutral current in a distribution system with a battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS, which operates as an uninterruptible power supply, is connected to the load side. In the proposed scheme, there are two circuit breakers (CBs) at the source and load sides. The wavelet transform of neutral current is performed using symlets 5 mother wavelet at level 2. The summation of the absolute values of level 2 detail coefficients is calculated, and the absolute value of the differentiation of this summation is proposed as a new index for detecting fault clearance. The CB at the source side is reclosed after detecting fault clearance using ADSum. Then, the CB at the load side is reclosed after the completion of a synchronism check. To verify the proposed scheme, the BESS is modeled using the ATP-ElectroMagnetic Transients Program. In addition, various simulations are conducted according to fault types and fault clearance times. Simulation results show that successful adaptive reclosing is possible in the distribution system with the BESS.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  This paper proposes a novel adaptive reclosing scheme in the distribution system with BESS. </LI> <LI>  A new index using wavelet transform is proposed to detect the fault clearance. </LI> <LI>  The system configuration and algorithm for the proposed adaptive reclosing scheme are discussed. </LI> <LI>  The proposed technique is verified by simulating the various fault clearing time and fault types. </LI> </UL> </P>"
Enhancement of microalgal growth and biocomponent-based transformations for improved biofuel recovery: A review,2018,"['Microalgae growth', 'Biofuel technologies', 'Algal biofuels']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Microalgal biomass has received much attention as feedstock for biofuel production due to its capacity to accumulate a substantial amount of biocomponents (including lipid, carbohydrate, and protein), high growth rate, and environmental benefit. However, commercial realization of microalgal biofuel is a challenge due to its low biomass production and insufficient technology for complete utilization of biomass. Recently, advanced strategies have been explored to overcome the challenges of conventional approaches and to achieve maximum possible outcomes in terms of growth. These strategies include a combination of stress factors; co-culturing with other microorganisms; and addition of salts, flue gases, and phytohormones. This review summarizes the recent progress in the application of single and combined abiotic stress conditions to stimulate microalgal growth and its biocomponents.

Association of Z-Score of the Log-Transformed A Body Shape Index with Cardiovascular Disease in People Who Are Obese but Metabolically Healthy: The Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2010,2018,"['Obesity', 'Metabolically benign', 'Body mass index', 'Body constitution', 'Cardiovascular disease']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: We aimed at evaluating the effect of the z-score of the log-transformed A Body Shape Index (LBSIZ) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes according to obesity phenotype.Methods: Data were collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 2007 to 2010. Obesity was defined as a body mass index above 25 kg/m2 and metabolic abnormality was defined as the presence of two or more metabolic risk factors of the Adult Treatment Panel III definition. The participants were classified by obesity and metabolic healthy status: metabolically healthy non-obese (MHNO), metabolically healthy obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy non-obese (MUNO), and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO). Each group was further classified into three groups based on the tertile of LBSIZ. A multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, income, education level, physical activities, alcohol, and energy intake was conducted to evaluate the odds ratio (OR) for CVD events.Results: In the multivariate logistic regression model, MHO participants who are within the third tertile of LBSIZ had a significantly higher OR for CVD events, whereas those who are within the first and second tertile of LBSIZ were not at high risk of developing CVDs compared to MHNO participants who are within the first tertile of LBSIZ. In addition, a similar increase in the OR was observed in MUNO or MUO participants.Conclusion: LBSIZ had the lowest risk for CVDs in the first tertile of LBSIZ and a linear relationship with all its tertiles in MHO, MUNO, and MUO participants."

TGF-b1 upregulates the expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 and hyaluronan synthesis in culture models of equine articular chondrocytes,2018,"['chondrocytes', 'horses', 'hyaluronan', 'hyaluronan synthases', 'transforming growth factors']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We investigated the effect of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-b1) on equine hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) gene expression and hyaluronan (HA) synthesis in culture models of articular chondrocytes. Equine chondrocytes were treated with TGF-b1 at different concentrations and times in monolayer cultures. In three-dimensional cultures, chondrocyte-seeded gelatin scaffolds were cultured in chondrogenic media containing 10 ng/mL of TGF-b1. The amounts of HA in conditioned media and in scaffolds were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. HAS2 mRNA expression was analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The uronic acid content and DNA content of the scaffolds were measured by using colorimetric and Hoechst 33258 assays, respectively. Cell proliferation was evaluated by using the alamarBlue assay. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), histology, and immunohistochemistry were used for microscopic analysis of the samples. The upregulation of HAS2 mRNA levels by TGF-b1 stimulation was dose and time dependent. TGF-b1 was shown to enhance HA and uronic acid content in the scaffolds. Cell proliferation and DNA content were significantly lower in TGF-b1 treatments. SEM and histological results revealed the formation of a cartilaginous-like extracellular matrix in the TGF-b1-treated scaffolds. Together, our results suggest that TGF-b1 has a stimulatory effect on equine chondrocytes, enhancing HA synthesis and promoting cartilage matrix generation."

We divide entrepreneurship into two types: business creation and innovation. Our estimation results show both types of entrepreneurship have significant positive effects on China’s GDP per capita growth rate over thesample period. Specifically, the annual growth rate of the GDP per capita will increase by 1.98 percentage points if business creation entrepreneurship increases by one standard deviation. Moreover, the annual growth rate will increase by 0.134 percentage points if innovation entrepreneurship increases by ten percent. The resultsare robust even when we control for different sets of demographical and institutional variables. China’s experience shows a strong government does not conflict with the entrepreneurs’ role."
Immune Characterization of Bone Marrow-Derived Models of Mucosal and Connective Tissue Mast Cells,2018,"['Mucosal mast cells', 'connective tissue mast cells', 'mast cell subsets']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: It is well appreciated that mast cells (MCs) demonstrate tissue-specific imprinting, with different biochemical and functional properties between connective tissue MCs (CTMCs) and mucosal MCs (MMCs). Although in vitro systems have been developed to model these different subsets, there has been limited investigation into the functional characteristics of the 2 major MC subsets. Here, we report the immunologic characterization of 2 MCs subsets developed in vitro from bone marrow progenitors modeling MMCs and CTMCs. Methods: We grew bone marrow for 4 weeks in the presence of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, interleukin (IL)-9, IL-3, and stem cell factor (SCF) to generate MMCs, and IL-4, IL-3, and SCF to generate CTMCs. Results: CTMCs and MMCs differed in growth rate and protease content, but their immune characteristics were remarkably similar. Both subsets responded to immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated activation with signaling, degranulation, and inflammatory cytokine release, although differences between subsets were noted in IL-10. CTMCs and MMCs showed a similar toll-like receptor (TLR) expression profile, dominated by expression of TLR4, TLR6, or both subsets were responsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not poly(I:C). CTMCs and MMCs express receptors for IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and respond to these cytokines alone or with modified activation in response to IgE cross-linking. Conclusions: The results of this paper show the immunologic characterization of bone marrow-derived MMCs and CTMCs, providing useful protocols for in vitro modeling of MC subsets."

The homogeneous governing equations of non-uniform one-dimensional structures are firstly transformed into the statevector equations. By applying the differential transformation method (DTM) into the system matrices and state-vectors represented by the power series, extremely simple recurrence formulas for the coefficients of power series are obtained comparing to the prior researches in the literature. Using the computed coefficients of power series obtained from the recurrence formulas, the transfer matrices that relates the state-vectors at the left-end position and at the right-end position of a finite element are readily formulated. Finally, the spectral element matrices (i.e, the dynamic stiffness matrices) for the non-uniform one-dimensional structure are obtained from the transfer matrices. Using the numerical studies, the accuracy of the present SEM is verified by comparison with the well-known finite element method (FEM)."
Activation of Persulfate by Nanosized Zero-Valent Iron (NZVI): Mechanisms and Transformation Products of NZVI,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The mechanisms involved in the activation of persulfate by nanosized zero-valent iron (NZVI) were elucidated and the NZVI transformation products identified. Two distinct reaction stages, in terms of the kinetics and radical formation mechanism, were found when phenol was oxidized by the persulfate/NZVI system. In the initial stage, lasting 10 min, Fe<SUP>0</SUP><SUB>(s)</SUB> was consumed rapidly and sulfate radicals were produced through activation by aqueous Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>. The second stage was governed by Fe catalyzed activation in the presence of aqueous Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> and iron (oxyhydr)oxides in the NZVI shells. The second stage was 3 orders of magnitude slower than the initial stage. An electron balance showed that the sulfate radical yield per mole of persulfate was more than two times higher in the persulfate/NZVI system than in the persulfate/Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> system. Radicals were believed to be produced more efficiently in the persulfate/NZVI system because aqueous Fe<SUP>2+</SUP> was supplied slowly, preventing sulfate radicals being scavenged by excess aqueous Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>. In the second stage, the multilayered shell conducted electrons, and magnetite in the shell provided electrons for the activation of persulfate. Iron speciation analysis (including X-ray absorption spectroscopy) results indicated that a shrinking core/growing shell model explained NZVI transformation during the persulfate/NZVI process.</P>[FIG OMISSION]</BR>"
The Unbearable Lightness of Being Muslim and Georgian: Religious Transformation and Questions of Identity among Adjara’s Muslim Georgians,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"After Georgia regained its independence following the collapse of the Soviet regime, national and religious identities gained particular importance. A religious revival was observed not only among Christians but also among the country’s Muslim communities. The region of Adjara is populated by Georgians who profess Islam. The aim of this paper is to explore the transformation of the religious landscape in Georgia and the idiosyncratic characteristics of identity in post-Soviet Adjara. The change in Adjara’s religious landscape has resulted in a specific and eclectic picture. Muslim identity in Georgia creates a religious and cultural model rooted in the specific historical, political, and cultural development of the region. For Muslim Adjarians Islam is the “religion of their forefathers” and at the same time part of their national [Georgian] identity. However, due to the long-standing dominance of the Christian national narrative in public discourse, Muslim identity has remained “suspicious.” Hence, Muslim Adjarians have suffered the traumatic experience of being perceived by the mainstream, Christian majority as not “perfect Georgians” because of their Islamic identity. Alongside this perception of marginality, Muslim Georgians demonstrate a particular Islamic identity with high intercultural competencies and tolerance."

High dispersed supported magnetic nanoparticles with particle sizes less than 30 nm were formed over activated carbon derived from local walnut shell. Surface characterizations of supported magnetic nanoparticles were evaluated by Boehm test, Brunauer- Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). A three-layer artificial neural network (ANN) code was developed to predict the Hg (II) ions removal from aqueous solution by AC@Fe3O4-NH2-COOH. The three-layer back-propagation (BP) is configured of tangent sigmoid transfer function (tansig) at hidden layer with eight neurons for AC@Fe3O4-NH2-COOH, and linear transfer function (purelin) at output layer. According to the calculated MSEs, Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) was the best training algorithm among others. The linear regressions between the predicted and experimental outputs were proven to be a good agreement with a correlation coefficient of about 0.9984 for five model variables. Maximum adsorption capacity was achieved 80mg/g by Langmuir isotherm at pH of 7 and salinity of 25,000 ppm. Kinetic studies illustrated that mercury adsorption follows pseudo-second-order."

The projected phase space (PPS) diagram and clustercentric distributions are used to analyse the dynamics of the cluster and study the distribution of various galaxy populations in the cluster and subclusters.</P><P><I>Results.</I> We find several infalling galaxy groups and subclusters. The cluster, supercluster, BCGs, and one infalling subcluster are all aligned. Their orientation is correlated with the alignment of the radio and X-ray haloes of the cluster. Galaxy populations in the main cluster and in the outskirts subclusters are different. Galaxies in the centre of the main cluster at the clustercentric distances 0.5 h<SUP>−1</SUP> Mpc (<I>D</I>c∕<I>R</I>vir < 0.5, <I>R</I>vir = 0.9 h<SUP>−1</SUP> Mpc) have older stellar populations (with the median age of 10−11 Gyr) than galaxies at larger clustercentric distances. Star-forming and recently quenched galaxies are located mostly at the clustercentric distances <I>D</I>c ≈ 1.8 h<SUP>−1</SUP> Mpc, where subclusters fall into the cluster and the properties of galaxies change rapidly. In this region the median age of stellar populations of galaxies is about 2 Gyr. Galaxies in A2142 on average have higher stellar masses, lower star formation rates, and redder colours than galaxies in rich groups. The total mass in infalling groups and subclusters is <I>M</I> ≈ 6 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> h<SUP>−1</SUP><I>M</I>⊙, that is approximately half of the mass of the cluster.

Mergers cause complex radio and X-ray structure of the cluster and affect the properties of galaxies in the cluster, especially at the boundaries of the cluster in the infall region. Explaining the differences between galaxy populations, mass, and richness of A2142, and other groups and clusters may lead to better insight about the formation and evolution of rich galaxy clusters.</P>"

Since GIS serves to transmit or disconnect high voltage currents, it is very important to maintain stable internal isolation condition. Previous researches have been conducted to detect Partial Discharge(PD) by Ultra High Frequency(UHF)sensors, focusing on partial discharge among the causes that deteriorate internal isolation condition. In this study, PD diagnostic method was developed using Phase Resolved Pulse Sequence(PRPS) image, which is an image of the UHF sensor signal of GIS used in the actual field. For actual data, there is a phase shift phenomenon of PRPS images due to measurement or synchronization errors, which makes it difficult to diagnose them. To solve this problem, a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) based Deep learning architecture robust to phase shift is proposed and it showed high diagnosis accuracy compared to previous algorithm."

In macro-level accident prediction model, exposure variable(e.g. a settled population) have been used as fundamental explanatory variable under the concept that each trip will be subjected to a probable risk of accident. However, a settled population may be embedded error by exclusion of active population concept. The objective of this research study is to develop macro-level accident prediction model using floating population variable(concept of including a settled population and active population) collected from mobile phone data. The concept of accident prediction models is introduced utilizing exposure variable as explanatory variable in a generalized linear regression with assumption of a negative binomial error structure. The goodness of fit of model using floating population variable is compared with that of the each models using population and the number of household variables. Also, log transformation models are additionally developed to improve the goodness of fit. The results show that the log transformation model using floating population variable is useful for capturing the relationships between accident and exposure variable and generally perform better than the models using other existing exposure variables. The developed model using floating population variable can be used to guide transportation safety policy decision makers to allocate resources more efficiently for the regions(or zones) with higher risk and improve urban transportation safety in transportation planning step."

Adopting a historical, dynamic and comprehensive perspective, the study argues to evaluate two main characteristics of the Finnish foreign policy in balance: (1) as a passive survival and adaptation strategy of a small country between superpowers and (2) as an active strategy to break the status quo through a diplomatic paradigm shift since the 1970s. For the analysis, it pays attentions not only to the well-studied Paasikivi-Kekkonen Doctrine (Paasikiven-Kekkosen linja) but also to a turn in foreign policy during the late period of Kekkonen’s presidency, and furthermore to the ex-President Mauno Koivisto’s leadership and foreign policy line during a transitional era between 1982 and 1994. The study also examines continual Constitutional reforms in Finland since the late 1980s and their influences on the foreign policy-making system. The conclusion reflects extensive implications of the evolving foreign policy model of Finland on the context of the Korean Peninsula looking forward to a transformational process into an alternative security and cooperation order."

In consideration of each shape’s direction and the status of existence, which are detailed shapes of parts upon making the template model, all the shapes of the AHU model can be expressed. By applying parametric modeling to the template model, a quick and precise modification and transformation can be conducted, thus the efficiency is enhanced. A user selects an AHU model from a 2D model selection program, and extracts shape information. The final AHU shape is completed through the automation work of unnecessary shape deletion by bringing the extracted shape information to the template model.

AUTOMATED DRIVING – CREATING GAIN OR REDUCING PAIN? AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF DIRECT AND MEDIATED EFFECTS ON WELLBEING,2018,"['transformative service research', 'innovation', 'automotive', 'well-being', 'technology']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background Our usage of technology and the continuous adoption of technological innovations has implications for our lives that go beyond traditional marketing questions such as product quality, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty. The psychological consequences of new technology affect our lives and our well-being as individuals. A current technological advancement is the ongoing development of automated driving capabilities. The recent advances have led to the diffusion of semi-autonomous driving systems, such as Teslas autopilot or Daimlers DISTRONIC PLUS. These commercially available technologies correspond to the second level of SAE international’s J3016 standard for automated driving, which ranges from 0 (“No Automation”) to 5 (“Full Automation”, no human needed). SAE level 2 (“Partial Automation”) is defined as “the driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and acceleration/deceleration using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver performs all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving.” (SEA On-Road Automated Driving (ORAD) committee, 2014). First of all, qualities of mobility such as safety and comfort influence well-being directly and autonomous driving has a potential impact on these qualities. Furthermore, advances in autonomous driving have particularly social but also ecological and economic benefits. On the one hand, social benefits result from increased social participation by improving mobility of the non-driving, elderly or people with travel-restrictive medical conditions (Harper, Hendrickson, Mangones, & Samaras, 2016; Wadud, MacKenzie, & Leiby, 2016). On the other hand, social benefits result from increasing road safety, less congestions as well as from a reduced number of accidents (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015). Individual social or personal benefits such as improved safety and comfort or reduced stress levels are also widely perceived by potential users (Bansal, Kockelman, & Singh, 2016; Karlsson & Pettersson, 2015). Additionally, ecological benefits can be realized due to more efficient driving of vehicles and a smoother traffic flow (Wadud et al., 2016). Economic benefits are mainly a result of decreased travel times and of the fact that at high automation levels driving time could be used more productively. Accordingly, this research tends to answer the following research questions: • How does automated driving impact consumers’ well-being? • What qualities of mobility (e.g. safety) mediate the impact of automated driving on consumers’ well-being? Conceptual Model As argued above, automated driving potentially has both a direct and an indirect (mediated) impact on well-being. Subjective well-being (SWB) describes one’s well-being through the global evaluation of life satisfaction (LS), positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA) (Diener, 1984). This tripartite concept of well-being has been widely adopted by researchers, even though the relationship of the three aspects remains in question (Busseri & Sadava, 2011). Busseri and Sadava (2011) provide an overview of five prominent conceptualizations: As three separate components, as a hierarchical construct, as a causal system, as a composite, and as configurations of components. We adhere to Diener’s original model that describes LS, PA, and NA as three separate components. Accordingly, the correlations among the three components are not of primary interest in this model. Therefore, the impact of automated driving on LS, PA, and NA is assessed separately in order to provide a full image of SWB. This leads to the following hypotheses: H1a. Semi-autonomous driving has a positive impact on the level of SWB by increasing positive affect. H1a. Semi-autonomous driving has a positive impact on the level of SWB by decreasing negative affect. H1c. Semi-autonomous driving has a positive impact on the level of SWB by increasing life satisfaction. Driving influences subjective well-being through different mediators. One potential mediating factor, discussed quite controversially in literature, is fun. While non-automated driving shows a higher level of fun than automated driving, still a large majority is fascinated by automated driving (Kyriakidis, Happee, & Winter, 2015) and also a discharge from the actual driving could be perceived as fun. The most relevant perceived benefit of automated driving studied in literature is safety, followed by stress (e.g. Bansal et al., 2016; Karlsson & Pettersson, 2015; Kyriakidis et al., 2015). Therefore, we formulate the following hypotheses: H2a. The impact of semi-autonomous driving well-being is mediated by fun. H2b. The impact of semi-autonomous driving well-being is mediated by stress. H2c. The impact of semi-autonomous driving well-being is mediated by security. Design/methodology/approach Our sample comprises of two groups with a total of 259 respondents. Group 1 contains 111 respondents using automated driving while group 2 contains 148 respondents not using automated driving. In a first step, to test hypotheses H1a to H1c, we use ANOVA to analyse the group’s differences regarding positive affect, negative effect, and life satisfaction. We analyse both the aggregated values and the single items for all three aspects of subjective well-being. ANOVA was conducted using SPSS version 25. In a second step, to test hypotheses H2a to H2c, three multiple parallel mediation models were estimated with ordinary least squares path analysis. Each model consisted of one of the aspects of SWB as the dependent variable as well as the three mediators. The models were estimated using PROCESS version 3.0 (Hayes, 2013) and SPSS version 25. Findings ANOVA shows a highly significant interaction between semi-automated driving and well-being for negative affect, but not for positive affect and life satisfaction. Looking at the items that amount to positive affect, we see that drivers with the new technology have more excitement, pride and interest. But these effects are counterweighted by significantly less activity, determination and attention. In the context of semi-autonomous driving, being less active, attentive and determined can be interpreted as a positive thing (driving more relaxed). Therefore, we adjust the positive affect scale and remove these three items to from the scale for further analysis. Cronbach’s alpha for all three aspects of subjective well-being is 0.73 or above, thus indicating adequate convergence. Mediation analysis (process model 4) on positive affect reveals a significant indirect effect of semi-automated driving moderated by fun. There is no significant mediation effect for safety and stress as well as no significant direct effect of semi-automated driving on positive affect. The parallel mediation model using negative affect as the dependent variable, shows a significant direct effect of semi-automated driving as well as significant indirect effects mediated by safety and stress. Semi-automated driving reduces negative affect directly as well as by increasing safety, which reduces negative affect. It also reduces negative affect by decreasing stress, which is positively linked to negative affect. Fun, however, has no significant effect on negative affect. Last, life satisfaction shows a combination of the effects mentioned above: Automated-driving has a significant positive direct effect on life satisfaction. Furthermore, life satisfaction is influenced positively through increased fun, safety, and decreased stress. Implications ANOVA and mediation analysis show a positive impact of semi-automated driving on subjective well-being, thus contributing to the investigation of new technologies on consumers’ well-being. Using Diener’s tripartite model of subjective well-being, analyses revealed that the positive effect is especially driven by reducing negative affect. Further research is needed to investigate the transformative impact of (semi-) autonomous driving more deeply and broadly. Especially investigations differentiating between target groups of the new technology might be an interesting path to follow, since the impact on the different aspects of SWB might differ (e.g. increase of positive affect for early adopters vs. decrease of negative affect for people with reduced mobility). Furthermore, our investigation contributes to the conceptual discussion about the structure of the tripartite model of subjective well-being. The fact that life satisfaction as a dependent variable, to some extent, combines the effects observed for positive and negative affect indicates that the three aspects are causally linked instead of being separate. Researchers have promoted a system where positive affect and negative affect are conceptualized as inputs to life satisfaction before (Busseri & Sadava, 2011). Last, our findings give directions to marketing executives for marketing new technologies in general and (semi-)automated driving specifically. First, practitioners need to think about the well-being impact of their technology, i.e. evaluate if it increases well-being by increasing positive affect or by decreasing negative affect. The two paths lead to different marketing measures and ways to promote the technology. More specifically, for semi-autonomous driving a mixed strategy commends itself. It is essential to demonstrate that the new technology reduces the pains of driving while being fun at the same time."

Recently, North Koreas willingness to dialogue, reform and open is similar to the precedent in which the Myanmar military junta dismantled its ruling system and turned over transition period through general elections in 2010 and 2015 each. The so-called ‘Myanmar Model refers to a country branded as a rogue state which has been under the international sanctions and pressure, and opening its political system and the market by choosing transformation. However, rapid changes in speed across the entire society after opening up are impossible because the political elite is only the leading role and implementation in the transition.  In case of Myanmar, military culture has penetrated into society due to such a long-lasting military dictatorship, and even democratic bloc has become accustomed to authoritarian decision-making process. Furthermore, the reserved area of the old regime still exists in a deformed political structure that can not retrieve the interests of the military. Therefore there could not be achieved political development in term of qualification.  North Korea also appears unlikely to achieve political and economic assessment in a short period of time, as civil society has not appeared due to its long dictatorship and very low economic development levels. Like Myanmar, North Korea is also likely to control the pace and direction of upcoming reforms and open, as the dictator or most powerful person chose to reform and open up. Therefore, if North Korea moves toward the Myanmar Model, there will be high expectations of new changes in the short term, but it could be delayed or stalled in the mid and long term."

A test was carried out by increasing the internal temperature status at 30 ℃, 50 ℃, and 65 ℃. By a linear transformation of the lifespan data for each temperature, a constant value and activation energy coefficient was induced for the Arrhenius equation and verified by comparing the value of a lifetime prediction model with the experimental value at 85℃. The failure modes of the ongoing or finished test were leakage, bellows separation, and internal deformation.

The original contribution of the model is that angular eccentricity is obtained without extra transformations. Thus the proposed approach is simpler than existing methods. The calculated back electromotive forces (EMFs) and cogging torque by the proposed method are compared with those obtained from the finite element (FE) model, the results show acceptable accuracy of the proposed method.

To calculate the fatigue damage from the spectra, time series were generated from the spectra using the inverse Fourier transform, and the rain-flow counting method was applied. The considered optimization variables were the size of the frequency increments, ratio of the time increment, and number of repetitions of the time series. In order to obtain optimized alues, the fatigue damage was calculated using the parameter values proposed in previous work, and the fatigue damage was calculated by increasing or decreasing the proposed values. The results were compared, and the error rate was checked. Based on the test results, new values were found for the size of the frequency increment and number of time series iterations. As a validation, the fatigue damage of an actual tension spectrum found using the new proposed values and fatigue damage found using the previously proposed method were compared. In conclusion, we propose a new optimized calculation process that is faster and more accurate than the existed method."
Directional Current-current Correlation Functions in a Two-species Hard-core Bosons in One Dimensional Finite Lattice: An Exact Diagonalization Study,2018,"['Exact diagonalization', 'Boson model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We study a model for two-species hard-core bosons in one dimension. In this model, the same-species bosons have a hard-core condition at the same site, while different-species bosons are allowed to occupy the same site with a local interaction U. At half-filling, by Jordan-Wigner transformation, the model can be exactly mapped to a fermionic Hubbard model. Due to this correspondence, the phase transition from superfluid (U = 0) to Mott insulator (U > 0) can be explained by simple one-band theory at half-filling. By using an exact diagonalization method adopting a modified Lanczos method, we obtain the ground states as a function of U for the lattice size upto L = 16. We calculate directional current-current correlation functions in this model, which indicate that there are some remaining counter-flow in the Mott insulating region (U > 0) and co-flow in the charge-density-wave region (U <0) for the finite lattices."

However, There is an increasing number of companies that want to increase their corporate value.There are various paths for creating corporate value of a patent, and there are methods for conducting a proprietary business of a company having a patent by utilizing exclusive rights as a legal protection function, which is a basic consideration of a patent right. Another way is not to do business directly, but through negotiation and contracts, you can increase the value of your company by licensing or selling it to generate royalties or profits.Organizational culture is defined as a macroscopic and comprehensive concept that affects the living environment of a person belonging to an organization, such as beliefs and values, cognition, behavioral norms and behaviors, customs and traditions, symbol systems, and become more important as organizational culture is recognized as an important resource of the enterprise.In recent years, organizational culture has been characterized by contradictory factors such as conflict, sympathy, dilemma, and inconsistency.

A Theoretical Revisit to the China’s Marketization: Reflection on Neo-liberal Approach to the Socialist Market Economy with Chinese Characteristics,2018,"['Neo-liberalism', 'Socialist Market Economy with Chinese Characteristics', 'Institutionalism', 'Marketization', 'Transformation.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"China currently is under the second transformation from the reform and opening-up policy to a new model for economic growth as the China’s economy is reaching limits to growth. The Chinese government strives to build a sustainable economic structure that is based on productivity and domestic consumption unlike the growth pattern so far based on investment and export. It raises questions whether the socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics can continue to work.Post-communist transformations have shown diverse pathways unlike initial predictions of the neo-classical economists as well as universalistic approaches within political science. The China’s marketization has clearly shown the case, building the socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics. The Chinese characteristics are a consequential configuration reflecting the China’s historical legacies and particular conditions in politics and economy. Political logic to sustain the CPC rule has led the Chinese leadership to take the gradualism as well as a dual-track approach. Some theorists still criticize the dislocation between the vibrant market economy and the lagged governance structure.However, the paper contends that China is still under the ongoing process of transformation. Therefore, it may not be proper to explain the Chinese particularism with the typical western model of state-society relations. Simply employing the mainstream theories and concepts developed in the western discipline of economics and political science may not provide a proper explanation upon the working principles of Chinese market economy since it has reflected China’s own conditions in politics, society, and economy.In this context, the paper revisits the debates between Neo-liberalism and Historical institutionalism over the Chinese ways of marketization because it is related to theoretical debates on feasibility and viability of the China’s particularism in its marketization. The paper examines the theoretical debates upon the post-communist transformation in China. Elaborating on diverse pathways of post-communist transformations unlike the Neo-liberalists predictions and prescription, the paper argues that China’s institutional particularity has been evolving toward its own political and socio-economic system. It finally demonstrates that the China’s market economy should not be understood with the typical western model of state-society relationship. The gist of this study is to analyze the processes and mechanisms that have formed the socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics."

For this purpose, the following questions were set: First, what cross-cultural adaptation process do expatriates experience? Second, what transformative process do they experience in cross-cultural adaptation? Third, what factors assist them in overcoming cross-cultural situations? This qualitative case study consisted of five Koreans who had worked as expatriates at U.S. plants of K Automobile Company for three years or more and then returned to Korea.The results of this study can be summarized according to three themes. First, the study participants experienced a time-series cross-cultural adaptation process that involved: ① cross-cultural friction, followed by ② crisis, ③ changes, and ④ adaptation. Second, the participants passed through Mezirow's (1991) transformative learning stages in the cross-cultural adaptation process. Their transformative process involved five stages: ① experience of a confusing dilemma; ② problem awareness and self-reflection; ③ requests for help and a shift in awareness; ④ perspective shifting and new attempts; and ⑤ awareness of a changed self. Third, there were several factors that catalyzed the participants into adopting positive cross-cultural adaptations. Organizational expectations and their sense of responsibility and duty facilitated both crisis and adaptation. Other facilitators of cross-cultural adaptation included advice from those with prior experiences, discussions and conversations with colleagues, advice provided by the Human Resources department, resident Koreans, help from HCNs, and help from natives. Discussions and conversations with colleagues and help from others were found to be vital to cross-cultural adaptation."

CREATING CONSUMER VALUES IN AIRBNB: TESTING THE EFFECTS OF THE UNDERLYING VALUE DIMENSIONS,2018,"['Sharing economy', 'Airbnb', 'consumer value', 'hotels', 'purchase intentions']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The rise of the sharing economy is transforming the tourism and hospitality industry (So, Oh, and Min, 2018; Zhu, So, and Hudson, 2017). The growing popularity of Airbnb has led a number of recent studies to investigate consumer value derived from such innovative consumption model. In the context of Airbnb, research shows that perceived value motivated travelers to choose Airbnb (Mao & Lyu, 2017). However, the theoretical construct of consumer value includes multiple dimensions, such as emotional value, social value, price value, and quality value, and how each dimension contributes to consumer attitudes and behavioral intentions toward Airbnb is unexplored. Therefore, this study sets forth a national field investigation to provide a holistic understanding of consumer evaluation of various value dimensions with respect to Airbnb experiences. To empirically test the proposed model, a quantitative, national online survey was conducted using Qualtrics Online Sample. After checking the performance of the measurement model, we evaluated the results of the structural model. The results show that emotional value and quality value significantly explain overall attitude toward Airbnb, whereas, price value and social value were not significant in predicting attitude. However, price value and social value, together with overall attitude, significantly explain consumer’s purchase intention. The results show that the t values from bootstrapping were greater than 1.96, and the R2 values for endogenous variables well exceeded .26. All exogenous constructs producing effect sizes ranging from small to large. In addition, the Q2 for the endogenous latent constructs were well above the threshold, with .421 for overall attitude and .472 for behavioral intentions, thereby substantiating the structural soundness of the proposed model."

Longitudinal System Identification of an Avian-Type UAV Considering Characteristics of Actuator,2018,"['Biomimetic aircraft', 'Flapping wing', 'Ornithopter', 'Linear model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"To develop autonomous flapping aircraft, basic mathematical modeling is essential to solve the problem of “uncertainty models” in biomimetic flight dynamics. This study identified the longitudinal linear model of an ornithopter via automated flight tests and sensors onboard the ornithopter to measure angular rates, Euler angles, and total velocity. For accurate flight tests, automated signal input was designed for elevator deflection: doublet and multistep 3211 maneuver. Furthermore, because the flapping motion of the ornithopter’s main wings generates oscillations during cruise flight, fast Fourier transform is used to analyze flight data in the frequency domain, and a Butterworth filter is used to filter out the flapping motion from the data. The characteristics of the actuator are then analyzed using a motion capture camera and applied to the system identification. The structure of the ornithopter linear model is found to be similar to that of a fixed-wing aircraft, which has a periodic oscillation. The results from the flight tests and analysis manifest that an ornithopter has unstable characteristics due to a single right-half plane real pole."

In this study, a new approach is proposed that involves treating true stress-true strain curves in uniaxial compression tests at various temperatures, and different strain rates in 0.1C-6Ni steel, which is a model alloy used to decelerate the kinetics of ferrite transformation from austenite. The initial flow stress up to peak stress was used to analyze the change in dynamic softening phenomena, such as dynamic recovery, dynamic recrystallization, and dynamic transformation. It is worth mentioning that for predicting the occurrence of dynamic transformation, flow stress before reaching peak stress is much more sensitive to the change in the dynamic softening rate due to dynamic transformation, compared to peak stress. It was found that the occurrence of dynamic ferritic transformation could be successfully obtained even at temperatures above Ae3 once the deformation condition was satisfied. This deformation condition is a function of both the strain rate and the deformation temperature, which can be described as the Zener - Hollomon parameter. In addition, the driving force of dynamic ferritic transformation might be much less than that of the dynamic recrystallization of austenite at a given deformation condition. By applying this technique, it is possible to predict the occurrence of dynamic transformation more sensitively compared with the previous analysis method using peak stress during deformation."

Therefore many researches on the lean transformation have been published. However, the number of researches considering the measurement of the benefit of lean transformation is relatively small. This lack of research caused some hesitation in adopting lean transformation, especially in small and medium sized manufacturing companies. In this research, a simulation model which can measure the benefit of lean manufacturing will be developed so as to compare its benefits under various business environments. Among the various lean transformation tools, this paper deals with the load balancing in a manufacturing cell, which is an essential step in the lean transformation. For the simulation test, system dynamics models which are composed of the process model and the operator model have been developed. Experimental tests comparing the balanced cell with non-balanced cell are performed. Test results are analyzed and some managerial implications are derived from the test results."

In the quadrotor model, the control input is coupled with nonlinear functions consisting of trigonometric functions. Because of these nonlinear functions, it is difficult to design the controller. Thus, existing papers use the linearized model to solve this problem. However, the linearized model has a narrow operating range and it requires constraints on the speed and Euler angles of the quadrotor. This paper proposes a new state transformation method. Since the proposed state transformations remove trigonometric functions from the control input, we can design the controller without using the linearized model. The new variables used for state transformations act as virtual controllers, and the actual control input is designed based on Lyapunov stability theory using these virtual controllers. From Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that all tracking errors converge to zero. This implies that the quadrotor tracks the reference trajectory well. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller is verified through simulation."
Water-filling algorithm based approach for management of responsive residential loads,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Integration of large number of electric vehicles (EVs) with distribution networks is devastating for conventional power system devices such as transformers and power lines etc. This paper proposes a methodology for management of responsive household appliances management and EVs with water-filling algorithm. With the proposed scheme, the load profile of a transformer is retained below its rated capacity while minimally affecting the associated consumers. When the instantaneous demand at transformer increases beyond its capacity, the proposed methodology dynamically allocates demand curtailment limit (DCL) to each home served by transformer. The DCL allocation takes convenience factors, load profile and information of flexible appliances into account to assure the comfort of all the consumers. The proposed scheme is verified by modeling and simulating five houses and a distribution transformer. The smart appliances such as an HVAC, a water heater, a cloth dryer and an EV are also modeled for the study. Results show that the proposed scheme performs to reduce overloading effects of the transformer efficiently and assures comfort of the consumers at the same time.</P>"

The distribution of each phase is assumed to be probabilistically distributed, and the Kapitza resistance at the interface between the filler and matrix was calculated by means of a molecular dynamics simulation. A polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) composite system embedded with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was used in a specific simulation. Composites containing MWCNTs of different lengths were also fabricated to obtain appropriate experimental results for the verification of the proposed model. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and field-emission scanning microscopy (FE-SEM) were carried out to confirm that the selected materials could suitably be compared. Finally, the proposed model was applied to the finite element method to examine the heat flux of the composites according to the constitutive properties, and their results were compared to the experimental results.</P>"

Joint effects of variable carbon emission cost and multi-delay-in-payments under single-setup-multiple-delivery policy in a global sustainable supply chain,2018,"['Sustainable supply chain', 'Carbon emission', 'Multi-level trade credit', 'Single-setup-multi-delivery policy', 'Variable transportation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>In today's global market, supply chain players have to cooperate mutually for extra benefits, long lasting paybacks, and to control carbon emission for a clean environment. This study develops the three-echelon sustainable supply chain model in the context of multi-level trade credit and single-setup-multiple-delivery policy for mutual coordination in financial support and reducing carbon emissions. These joint effects will benefit the firms for interim financing as well as minimize carbon emission for a clean environment. This model quantifies the effects of the environmental regulations and trade credit period under the single-setup-multiple-delivery policy. The supplier produces semi-finished items and transports it to the manufacturer, the manufacturer transform these semi-finished items into final products. These finished products finally transported to multi-retailer. The shipments are permitted to proceed from the particular lot during production instead after completing the entire lot This strategy save the environment by minimizing carbon emission. Additionally, a multi-level trade credit policy is considered in this model for short-term investment. An algebraic approach is used to derive a closed form optimal result for the designed model. This non-derivative method provides the effective solution algorithm. The main contribution of this study is to minimize the sustainable supply chain cost of the system by jointly considering the multi-level delay-in-payment, variable carbon emission cost, and variable transportation cost under the single-setup-multi-delivery policy.

Dynamic effective connectivity in resting state fMRI,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<▼1><P>Context-sensitive and activity-dependent fluctuations in connectivity underlie functional integration in the brain and have been studied widely in terms of synaptic plasticity, learning and condition-specific (e.g., attentional) modulations of synaptic efficacy. This dynamic aspect of brain connectivity has recently attracted a lot of attention in the resting state fMRI community. To explain dynamic functional connectivity in terms of directed effective connectivity among brain regions, we introduce a novel method to identify dynamic effective connectivity using spectral dynamic causal modelling (spDCM). We used parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) to model fluctuations in directed coupling over consecutive windows of resting state fMRI time series. Hierarchical PEB can model random effects on connectivity parameters at the second (between-window) level given connectivity estimates from the first (within-window) level. In this work, we used a discrete cosine transform basis set or eigenvariates (i.e., expression of principal components) to model fluctuations in effective connectivity over windows. We evaluated the ensuing dynamic effective connectivity in terms of the consistency of baseline connectivity within default mode network (DMN), using the resting state fMRI from Human Connectome Project (HCP). To model group-level baseline and dynamic effective connectivity for DMN, we extended the PEB approach by conducting a multilevel PEB analysis of between-session and between-subject group effects. Model comparison clearly spoke to dynamic fluctuations in effective connectivity – and the dynamic functional connectivity these changes explain. Furthermore, baseline effective connectivity was consistent across independent sessions – and notably more consistent than estimates based upon conventional models. This work illustrates the advantage of hierarchical modelling with spDCM, in characterizing the dynamics of effective connectivity.</P></▼1><▼2><P><B>Highlights</B></P><P>•<P>We describe efficient estimation of dynamics in resting state effective connectivity.</P>•<P>Spectral DCM and PEB are used to model fluctuations in neuronal coupling over time.</P>•<P>Dynamics in responses are explained in terms of its causes (effective connectivity).</P>•<P>Baseline and dynamic components of the default mode connectivity are identified.</P></P></▼2>"
Assessing Pesticide Effects on Honeybee Movement Behavior using an In-hive Imaging System,2018,"['Honeybee interaction behavior', 'Behavioral pattern', 'Finite state machine (FSM)', 'Machine learning', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Food and cash crops in the world naturally depend on honeybees for delivering pollen. In recent years, the occurrence of the honeybee colony collapse disorder (CCD) caused a large number of honeybee populations to disappear. This phenomenon is causing a significant impact on agricultural production. Therefore, this study aims to monitor the behavior of honeybees and establish effective analysis tools to understand the causes of CCD. Honeybee interaction behavior inside the beehives offers important behavioral information. In order to analyze honeybee behavior, each individual honeybee was affixed with waterproof text labels for observation. Using image processing techniques, such as label recognition and tracking, the movement of the honeybee inside the hive are recorded. By using label tags, the honeybee can be labeled by groups, and the trajectories can be used to classify them into different groups. After obtaining the honeybee trajectories, the states and transformation conditions were determined and used to create a finite state machine (FSM) model. The FSM model was used to analyze the trajectories of the honeybee: it was divided into multiple secondary trajectories by different conditions and state transitions. The model could also be used to transform the trajectories into patterns of behavior and were combined into a sequence of behavioral patterns. Using the data obtained, it was found that in-hive and foraging bees have different trajectory and behavioral patterns. It was also found that the behavioral pattern sequences and trajectories can be used to train models using machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify and recognize different groups of honeybees. Experiments were performed using the imaging system to record and analyze long-term observation of honeybee movement behavior after treatment with pesticide in contaminated food. We further demonstrated this technique in assessing the effect of pesticide on the change of movement behaviors of honeybees."
Influence of Fluid Motions on Polymorphic Crystallization of <small>l</small>-Histidine: Taylor Vortex Flow and Turbulent Eddy Flow,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The mechanistic influence of fluid motions, such as a Taylor vortex flow and turbulent eddy flow, on the polymorphic crystallization of <SMALL>l</SMALL>-histidine was investigated. Couette–Taylor (CT) and mixing tank (MT) crystallizers were used for the Taylor vortex flow and turbulent eddy flow, respectively. Due to its periodic fluid motion, the Taylor vortex flow was found to be more favorable than the turbulent eddy flow for polymorphic nucleation of the stable phase. Thus, the polymorphic fraction of the stable phase at the induction point (called the “initial stable polymorphic fraction”) in the CT crystallizer was always much higher than that in the MT crystallizer for all variations of the crystallization conditions, including the rotation/agitation speed, ethanol fraction in the mixture solvent, and cooling rate. When increasing the rotation speed of the inner cylinder in the CT crystallizer, the initial stable polymorphic fraction was significantly increased and reached 100% at a rotation speed above 700 rpm. A 100% initial stable polymorphic nucleation was not achievable in the MT crystallizer, even at a high agitation speed over 2500 rpm. The periodic Taylor vortex was also effective for mass transfer. Thus, the phase transformation rate in the CT crystallizer was several scores higher than that in the MT crystallizer. The polymorphic crystallization with the two fluid motions when varying the rotation/agitation speed, ethanol fraction in the mixture solvent, and cooling rate was also described using a simple model based on flow-induced nucleation and mass transfer. The model successfully predicted the experimental results of the initial stable polymorphic fraction and phase transformation rate in both crystallizers with all variations of the crystallization conditions. According to the model, the periodic fluid motion of the Taylor vortex flow was much more effective than the turbulent eddy flow for promoting stable polymorphic nucleation and phase transformation.</P><P>Taylor vortex flow was more effective for polymorphic nucleation of the stable phase than turbulent eddy flow. 100% of initial stable polymorphic fraction could be achieved in Taylor vortex flow.

AN EXPLORATIVE STUDY OF INNOVATIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN A HOSPITALITY STARTUP CONTEXT,2018,"['innovative entrepreneurship', 'innovation', 'entrepreneurship', 'hospitality']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Introduction Due to fierce competition in the marketplace, globalization and an explosion of technology in recent years, innovation and differentiation are considered as a necessity for every company (Tajeddini & Trueman, 2008a). At the same time, to achieve market success and sustain a competitive advantage, businesses need to exploit new opportunities, develop new products and/or services and markets (Berthon, McHulbert, & Pitt, 2004) as well as place customer orientation at the heart of the firm’s competitiveness (Deshpande, Farley, & Webster, 1993). Hospitality entrepreneurship is a pivotal factor in the development and growth of many national economies (Hospitality Standards Institute, 2012), and in Taiwan, a significant proportion of hospitality businesses are small owner-operated outlets (). Therefore, understanding the nature of, and challenges faced by hospitality entrepreneurs is an important issue for researchers, as well as current and future entrepreneurs, financial institutions, local authorities, and government. This article reports on an exploratory study of qualitative data collected through open-ended questions, understanding of the many factors influencing entrepreneurs to start their businesses. Literature As noted by Middleton (2001), small businesses form a seedbed for the entrepreneurial and enterprise culture on which much of the profit and employment prospects of big businesses ultimately depend. This observation clearly indicates the difference between small business owners and entrepreneurs. But although support for this viewpoint in the literature is universal, some researchers do not draw such a fine line between the two terms when discussing related issues; also, studies of small business firms are usually found in the entrepreneurship literature, where sometimes the two terms are used interchangeably. The existing entrepreneurship literature shows that several critical factors influence the birth and growth of start-up firms. These factors include both macro-level environmental and micro-level, or personal level, forces. Studies focusing on the former often examine the influence of politics, culture, society, economics, competition, and demographics on a person’s decision to start or grow a new business in a specific setting; this in turn can take place at different levels, such as the company, city, region, or nation (Jogartnam, 2002; Ramos-Rodriguez et al., 2012). Studies on the latter investigate the influence of personal characteristics, such as subculture, social factors (e.g., role, status, reference group), personal factors (e.g., age, gender, education, life cycle, personality, self-perception, lifestyles, values), and psychological factors (e.g., motives, beliefs, attitudes, perceptions, learning, risk-taking propensity, etc. (Littunen, 2000; Ramos-Rodriguez et al., 2012). This study adopted Chen and Elston’s (2013) entrepreneurial activity model for classifying and modeling these factors affecting firm start-ups and growth. Fig. 1 captures this process and highlights the critical factors influencing the entrepreneurial process and their various relationships. In this model, the macro-environment mix influences not only a person’s personal characteristics but also this person’s entrepreneurial process. These personal characteristics in turn also influence the entrepreneurial process. The research methodology was conducted with qualitative research method. Firstly, we interviewed the experts with regard to this industry, and then used content analysis for the interview records. After the in-depth interviews, a grounded theory was adopted to analyze the interview data with repeated coding and reading, and then innovative entrepreneurship were coded into fundamental categories with diverse descriptions (Corbin & Strauss, 1990). These descriptions represent the idea and meaning squeeze from the transcripts of interview. As for the research reliability, we read the biographies of participants and collect relative information such as their provided books, documents and reports from the news. To guarantee the validity of this study, we also improve the research content with researchers’ interview and reflection notes. Those notes were observation on innovative entrepreneurship process in this study. Therefore, these systematic methods could conclude a theory for a specific phenomenon (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). Results The results of our qualitative analysis demonstrated the opinions of experts with regard to innovative entrepreneurship in hotel industry. Based on Chen and Elston’s (2013) entrepreneurial activity model, the characteristics of each concept were grounded with four dimensions: (1) Macro-environment mix (2) Personal characteristics (3) Entrepreneurial Proces (4) Major entrepreneurial outcome.

Valuing equity-indexed annuities with icicled barrier options,2018,"['Autocallable product', 'EIA', 'Esscher transform', 'Icicled barrier option', 'Reflection principle']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Inspired by the recent popularity of autocallable structured products, this paper intends to enhance equity-indexed annuities (EIAs) by introducing a new class of barrier options, termed icicled barrier options. The new class of options has a vertical (icicled) barrier along with the horizontal one of the ordinary barrier options, which may act as an additional knock-in or knock-out trigger. To improve the crediting method of EIAs, we propose a new EIA design, termed autocallable EIA, with payoff structure similar to the autocallable products except for the minimum guarantee, and further investigate the possibility of embedding various icicled barrier options into the plain point-to-point or the ratchet EIAs.Explicit pricing formulas for the proposed EIAs and the icicled barrier options are obtained under the Black–Scholes model. To the purpose, we derive the joint distribution of the logarithmic returns at the icicled time and the maturity, and their running maximum. As an application of the well-known reflection principle, the derivation itself is an interesting probability problem and the joint distribution plays a key role in the subsequent pricing stage. Our option pricing result can be easily transferred to EIAs or other equity-linked products. The pricing formulas for the EIAs and the options are illustrated through numerical examples."

At the same time, digital technology has enabled more design freedom in the vertical dimension. ""Twisting"" has gradually become the morphological choice of many city landmark buildings in recent years. The form seems more likely to be driven by the interaction of aesthetics and structural engineering. Environmental performance is often a secondary consideration; it is typically not simulated until the evaluation phase. Based on the research results of ""DigitalFUTURE Shanghai 2017 Workshop - Wind Tunnel Visualization"", an approach that can be employed by architects to design environmental-performance buildings during the early stages has been explored. The integration of a dynamic form-finding approach (DFFA) and programming transforms the complex relationship between architecture and environment into a dialogue of computer language and dynamic models. It allows the design to focus on the relationship between morphology and the surrounding environment, and is not limited to the envelope form itself. This new concept of DFFA in this research consists of three elements: 1) architectural form; 2) integration of wind tunnel and dynamic models; and 3) environmental response. The concept of wind tunnel testing integrated with a dynamic model fundamentally abandons the functional definition of the traditional static environment simulation analysis. Instead it is driven by integral environmental performance as the basic starting point of morphological generation."

Das Theater existiert heute nicht mehr nur als eine Kunst der irrationalen Emotion. Zeitgenössisches Theater rezipiert aktiv post-dramatische Methoden und subversive Perspektiven der Wissenschaft. Die Art und Weise, wie das philosophische Denken in den Begriff der Wissenschaft eingebettet ist, trägt zur Erweiterung der Größe und Breite des zeitgenössischen Denkens im Theater bei. Dies entspricht der revolutionären Natur der Wissenschaft. Das Revolutionäre der Wissenschaft trägt zur progressiven Ausrichtung des Theaters bei. Geht man davon aus, dass eine Auffuhrung kein Produkt des Zufalls, sondern Resultat menschlicher Intention ist, ermöglicht die ‘intentionale Rationalität’ das Theater als wissenschaftlich und kunstlerisch fundiertes Ereignis. Dies liegt daran, dass die Rationalität den traditionellen Bereich der Emotion in der Kunst hin zu einer Transformation des Blickes erweitert. Ein postdramatisches Theater, das mit wissenschaftlichen und rationalen Methoden und Techniken arbeitet, in Form eines dokumentarischen Lehrtheaters, reflektiert die Gleichzeitigkeit von Wissenschaft und Kunst und deren Entgrenzung.Insbesondere das Stuck < Black Tie > von Rimini-Protokoll (2008) bestätigt diese Tendenz zur Gleichzeitigkeit und Entgrenzung von Wissenschaft und Kunst. Dieses dokumentarische Lehrtheater erklärt die Offenheit der zeitgenössischen Gesellschaft und Kultur, die sich auf das Paradigma der Wissenschaft konzentriert.

Bei der Analyse ihres Körpers stellt sie fest, dass dieser nicht dem kulturell ‘unmarkierten’, d.h. dem ‘europäischen’ Körper entspricht. Gleichzeitig wird anerkannt, dass diese Diskrepanz auch fur alle Menschen gilt. Denn der Mensch existiert - und das ist universell - letztlich als Differenz. Unterschiede in den Genen zeigen die Universalität des Menschen und die konstitutionellen Kräfte des Körpers sowie die einheitliche Kultur zwischen den Menschen beeinflussen virtuelle Emotionen und die Gestaltung einer fiktiven Welt.In Rimini-Protokolls Versuchsanordnung wird der Körper von Miriam auf der Buhne wissenschaftlich ,gelesen’ und der Prozess der Analyse seiner Differenz zeigt, dass die soziale Position des gesellschaftlich gegebenen Anderen tatsächlich eine Ideologie ist.Hier wird die Möglichkeit der Widerlegung als Ausdruck der Diskontinuität der kulturellen Ideologie und Identität vom Körper dominiert. Der Körper wird zur wissenschaftlichen Grundlage und zum Subjekt, um die Unmöglichkeit einer fixierten Identität und die Inkompatibilität der Identitäten, die Diskrepanz der kulturellen Vererbung zu identifizieren und dieses Problem letztlich abzuschaffen. Auf diese Weise zeigt < Black Tie >, dass die Formulierung kultureller Identität durch die Analyse des Körpers des Subjekts auf der Buhne nicht fixiert wird. Die kulturelle Diskontinuität zwischen Körper und Geist wird widerlegt. Die Nicht-Reproduzierbarkeit der Auffuhrung wird betont durch den Prozess des Performativen, indem der Sinn fur die Präsenz und die Aufhebung der Subjektivität von dem Akteur-Performer, der objektive Beweis der Wissenschaft, die Genauigkeit der Technik und die Möglichkeit der Mikroanalyse miteinander verknupft werden.Der Körper fungiert als materielle Grundlage, um die kulturellen Klassen und Grenzen zu uberwinden und die Auflösung der Ideologie des zeitgenössischen Theaters zu betreiben.

Owing to its reconfigurability, a flexible fixture can take different layouts depending on the workpiece geometry and location. By finding the appropriate workpiece location, the deformation of workpieces under machining forces and their own weights can be reduced, hence increasing the quality of the final products. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for optimum workpiece positioning in rod type flexible fixtures for thin-walled components. First, the geometry of the workpiece is extracted from its CAD model. Second, a geometry-based method is proposed to find the optimal location of the workpiece relative to the fixture system. A composition of homogeneous transformations is performed to maximize the workpiece support capacity, initially place the workpiece in the fixture region, and maximize the number of active fixture elements (fixels).

Intensification of the processes of dehydrogenation and dewaxing of middle distillate fractions by redistribution of hydrogen between the units,2018,"['Oil Refining', 'Hydrogen', 'Dehydrogenation', 'Hydrodewaxing', 'Modelling', 'Middle Distillate']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The dehydrogenation and dewaxing of hydrocarbons of middle-distillate fractions, which proceed in the hydrogen medium, are of great importance in the petrochemical and oil refining industries. They increase oil refining depth and allow producing gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fractions used in the production of hydrocarbon fuels, polymer materials, synthetic detergents, rubbers, etc. Herewith, in the process of dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons of middle distillate fractions (C9-C14) hydrogen is formed in the reactions between hydrocarbons, and the excess of hydrogen slows the target reaction of olefin formation and causes the shift of thermodynamic equilibrium to the initial substances.Meanwhile, in the process of hydrodewaxing of hydrocarbons of middle distillate fractions (C5-C27), conversely, hydrogen is a required reagent in the target reaction of hydrocracking of long-chain paraffins, which ensures required feedstock conversion for production of low-freezing diesel fuels. Therefore, in this study we suggest the approach of intensification of the processes of dehydrogenation and dewaxing of middle distillate fractions by means of redistribution of hydrogen between the two units on the base of the influence of hydrogen on the hydrocarbon transformations using mathematical models. In this study we found that with increasing the temperature from 470 oC to 490 oC and decreasing the hydrogen/feedstock molar ratio in the range of 8.5/1.0 to 6.0/1.0 in the dehydrogenation reactor, the production of olefins increased by 1.45-1.55%wt, which makes it possible to reduce hydrogen consumption by 25,000Nm3/h. Involvement of this additionally available hydrogen in the amount from 10,000 to 50,000Nm3/h in the dewaxing reactor allows increasing the depth of hydrocracking of long-chain paraffins of middle distillate fractions, and, consequently improving low-temperature properties of produced diesel fraction. In such a way cloud temperature and freezing temperature of produced diesel fraction decrease by 1-4 oC and 10-25 oC (at the temperature of 300 oC and 340 oC respectively). However, when the molar ratio hydrogen/hydrocarbons decreases from 8.5/1.0 to 6.0/ 1.0 the yield of side products in the dehydrogenation reactor increases: the yield of diolefins increases by 0.1-0.15%wt, the yield of coke increases by 0.07-0.18%wt depending on the feedstock composition, which is due to decrease in the content of hydrogen, which hydrogenates intermediate products of condensation (the coke of amorphous structure).This effect can be compensated by additional water supply in the dehydrogenation reactor, which oxidizes the intermediate products of condensation, preventing catalyst deactivation by coke. The calculations with the use of the model showed that at the supply of water by increasing portions simultaneously with temperature rise, the content of coke on the catalyst by the end of the production cycle comprises 1.25-1.56%wt depending on the feedstock composition, which is by 0.3-0.6%wt lower that in the regime without water supply."

Meanwhile, the quarterly data form the first quarter of 2000 to the fourth quarter of 2017 are employed to conduct an empirical analysis under the vector auto-regressive model. The international trade between China and South Korea is treated as an independent variable.

Position Control Using Lyapunov Based Current Control for Sawyer Motors,2018,"['Sawyer motor', 'Position control', 'PID control']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controls have been widely used for Sawyer motors. The electrical dynamics are generally neglected in general PID controller since the electrical dynamics are faster than the mechanical dynamics. However, when the current control is used, the phase currents are reduced by back-emf and have the phase lags due to inductances. Thus, the electrical dynamics should be considered to improve the performance of PID control. In this paper, a position control using Lyapunov based current control is developed for improved performance of PID control. The proposed method consists of PID controllers for mechanical dynamics and Lyapunov-based controllers for electrical dynamics. PID controllers make the desired forces and torque to track the position profiles of X and Y with regulation of yaw. And the commutation scheme from the desired forces and torque to the desired phase currents are used. For the design of Lyapunov-based control, the stabilities of the equilibrium points are studied using Lyapunov method. Then, Lyapunov-based control is designed to compensate back-emfs and phase lags. Furthermore, the proposed method guarantees the exponential stabilities of desired currents for PID control. And, the closed-loop system is analyzed. The proposed method considering the electrical dynamics is designed without any coordinate transformation. Therefore, it could reduce the commutation delay. Simulation results show that the tracking performance of PID controller is improved by the proposed method."

In this paper, a dilation conversionalmodel was established to calculate carbides fraction in AISI H13 hot-work tool steel based on the measured length changes.After carbides precipitation, the alloy contents in the matrix changed. In the usual models, the content of carbon atoms afterprecipitation is considered as the only element that affects the lattice constant and the content of the alloy elements suchas Cr, Mo, Mn, V are often ignored. In the model introduced in this paper, the alloying elements (Cr, Mo, Mn, V) changescaused by carbides precipitation are incorporated. The carbides were identified using scanning electron microscope andtransmission electron microscope. The relationship between lattice constant of carbides and temperature are measured byhigh-temperature X-ray diffraction. The results indicate that the carbides observed in all specimens cooled at different ratesare V-rich MC and Cr-rich M23C6,and most of them are V-rich MC, only very few are Cr-rich M23C6.The model includingthe effects of substitutional alloying elements shows a good improvement on carbides fraction predictions. In addition, lowercooling rate advances the carbides precipitation for AISI H13 specimens. The results between experiments and mathematicalmodel agree well."

Due to the useof continuous cadastral maps and individual cadastral maps created by different standards, such as surveying coordinatesystem, surveying origin, and triangulation point, KR requested LX to perform surveying to designate a line and cadastraloverlapping map to solve the inconsistency problem. This study attempted to improve the accuracy of cadastraloverlapping map in implementation design. It used 90 points around one railway line, divided models by collective anddistrict, and carried out coordinate transformation. The RMSE of the batch application model was 0.1372, and theRMSE of the district model was 0.0245. Therefore, it can be deduced that this method provides a way to reduce errorby calculating and applying the number of coordinate systems in each district when creating a cadastral overlappingmap."

Expression of the proto-oncogene c-Jun progresses the cell cycle from G1 to S phase, but when its expression becomes awry it leads to uncontrolled proliferation and angiogenesis. Delivering a JNK2 siRNA (siJNK2) in tumor tissue was anticipated to reverse the condition with subsequent onset of apoptosis which predominantly requires an efficient delivering system capable of penetrating through the compact tumor mass. In the present study, it was demonstrated that polymannitol-based vector (PMGT) with inherent hyperosmotic properties was able to penetrate through and deliver the siJNK2 in the subcutaneous tumor of xenograft mice. Hyperosmotic activity of polymannitol was shown to account for the enhanced therapeutic delivery both in vitro and in vivo because of the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which stimulates caveolin-1 for caveolae-mediated endocytosis of the polyplexes. Further suppression of JNK2 and hence c-Jun expression led to the activation of caspase-9 to induce apoptosis and inhibition of tumor growth in xenograft mice model. The study exemplifies PMGT as an efficient vector for delivering therapeutic molecules in compact tumor tissue and suppression of JNK2 introduces a strategy to inhibit tumor progression.</P>   <P><B>Graphical abstract</B></P>  <P>Hyperosmotic PMGT driven siJNK2 delivery in compact cancer cells inhibits c-jun phosphorylation resulting in tumor growth arrest via caspase-9 induction and apoptosis.</P> <P>[DISPLAY OMISSION]</P>"

Each firm`s DSA is evaluated based on the efficiency scores calculated using data envelopment analysis(DEA). This paper tests whether a firm`s DSA positively affects the firm`s value and the value relevance of accounting information. Our sample consists of manufacturing firms listed on the Korean Stock Exchange over the period 2002-2015 with fiscal years ending in December. The empirical results are summarized as follows. First, we classify sample firms into three life-cycle stages to categorize them into similar competitive environment. The number of sample firms classified into the growth, mature and decline stages are 766(17.01%), 2,888(64.14%) and 849(18.85%), respectively. Sample firms in the mature stage are prevalent than those in the other stages. Second, this study estimates a Cobb-Douglass stochastic frontier production function and finds that operating expense ratio(OPE), property, plant & equipment ratio(PPE), inventory turnover(INV) and education & training expenses(EDU) affect positively on the profitability measured as returns on assets(ROA). Third, we measure DSA adopting the output-oriented four-inputs (i.e. OPE, PPE, INV and EDU) one output (i.e. ROA) DEA model. We calculate DSA in each of the different life-cycle stages. The average of DSA for the entire sample firms is 0.77, signifying that the degree of transforming the performance of KSF into ROA is 77% compared to frontier firms. Fourth, we test the effects of DSA on the stock price of a firm and the value relevance of accounting information using Ohlson model and find that DSA has a positive relationship with the stock price and increases the value relevance of both book value per share(BPS) and earnings per share(EPS). This paper suggests a new methodology to measure DSA for each firm and reveals that the measure affects positively on firm value and the value relevance of accounting information."
An Improved Spin Echo Train De-noising Algorithm in NMRL,2018,"['Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Logging', 'Signal to Noise Ratio', 'Spin Echo Train', 'Wavelet Transform']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Since the amplitudes of spin echo train in nuclear magnetic resonance logging (NMRL) are small and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is also very low, this paper puts forward an improved de-noising algorithm based on wavelet transformation. The steps of this improved algorithm are designed and realized based on the characteristics of spin echo train in NMRL. To test this improved de-noising algorithm, a 32 points forward model of big porosity is build, the signal of spin echo sequence with adjustable SNR are generated by this forward model in an experiment, then the median filtering, wavelet hard threshold de-noising, wavelet soft threshold de-noising and the improved de-noising algorithm are compared to de-noising these signals, the filtering effects of these four algorithms are analyzed while the SNR and the root mean square error (RMSE) are also calculated out. The results of this experiment show that the improved de-noising algorithm can improve SNR from 10 to 27.57, which is very useful to enhance signal and de-nosing noise for spin echo train in NMRL."
Hemodynamic Flow in a Vertical Cylinder with Heat Transfer,2018,"['two-phase blood flow', 'magnetic particles', 'heat transfer', 'fractional derivative', 'Joint Laplace and Hankel transforms']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In blood, the concentration of red blood cells varies with the arterial diameter. In the case of narrow arteries, red blood cells concentrate around the centre of the artery and there exists a cell-free plasma layer near the arterial wall due to Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect. Due to non-uniformity of the fluid in the narrow arteries, it is preferable to consider the two-phase model of the blood flow. The present article analyzes the heat transfer effects on the two-phase model of the unsteady blood flow when it flows through the stenosed artery under an external pressure gradient. The direction of the artery is assumed to be vertical and the magnetic field is applied along the radial direction of the artery. Blood is considered as a non-Newtonian Casson fluid with uniformly distributed magnetic particles. Both the blood and magnetic particles are moving with distinct velocities. This two-phase problem is modelled using the Caputo-Fabrizio derivative approach and then solved for an exact solution using joint Laplace & Hankel transforms. Effects of pertinent parameters such as Grashoff number, Prandtl number, Casson fluid parameter and fractional parameters, and magnetic field on blood velocity and particle velocity have been shown graphically for both large and small values of time. Both velocity profiles increase with the increase of Grashoff number and Casson fluid parameter and reduce with the increase of magnetic field and Prandtl number. The behaviour of temperature is studied for different values of the fractional parameter."

It also discuss about effectiveness of industrial policy as a development strategy. The soft budget constraints and incentive problems resulted in the collapse of Soviet bloc and COMECON in early 1990s. After the collapse, Cuban economy suffered a steep dive, and national income tumbling down rapidly. Cuban faced serious shortages of food, gasoline, and other basic necessities of life. To halt and partially reverse economic downturn and dire austerity in the 1990’s, the Cuban government made some partial reforms to the inherited Soviet system of cental planningand faced severe shortage in food, energy, and daily necessities. In response to the economic crisis. Cuba introduced economic reforms and implemented industrial policy as a development strategy as long as Cuba maintained a strong socialist country.Cuban government established the economic free zone law and attempted to induce foreign direct investment by implementing export-led industrial policy. Fiedel Castro approved the Law No. 165 Free Zones and Industrial Parks, in 1996. However, Cuba's ESZ strategy seems to have failed because of the U.S. sanctions, but also because of Cuba's own policies, which do not allow foreign investors to hire workers directly and impose a high implicit tax on wages. By limiting advanced techniques of personnel and organization management, indirect employment can result in lowering work efforts and productivity of workers, and aggravating production efficiency in the ESZs. Another reason to fail comes from the double wage structure due to the double monetary-exchange rate system. Most of the high non-wage costs result from the double exchange rate system.Due to Cuba’s imbalanced industry and production structures, concentrated labor force, and urbanization and centralization of agriculture production, the industrial transformation development model suggested by Lewis has not been successful unlike other Asian agriculture-led development model. Cuba has to overcome many difficulties in implementing industrial policy as a development strategy."

Analyzing intersections between Ruhl’s anti-gravity dramaturgy and philosophies of Camus, Nietzsche, Weil, and Bergson, who have delved into human existential problems in relation to the concept of gravity, this critique demonstrates how Ruhl’s drama, armed with the spirit of child(Nietzsche’s Übermensch) and the descending power of grace(Weil), changes the solemn battle against gravity into a dancing of elan vital(Bergson) that continues to generate spontaneous metamorphosis leading to new communities across boundaries. This work also uses the metaphor of “a perfect joke”(The Clean House) to illuminate Ruhl’s Ovidian dramaturgy that is untranslatable, collective, liminal, and transformative. Freed from the gravity of the Aristotelian “unities,” Ruhl’s Ovidian drama expresses and embodies the dynamics of vital energy with no chain of causality in plot or psychological details of characters. In conclusion, this paper argues that Ruhl, like Bergson, emphasizes the importance of action and challenges the audience to interpret her unconventional play from their own perspectives and thereby participate in the duration of elan vital with their on-going “differences.”"

This caused a dramatic change of Vietnam’s economy towards modernization. However, the urbanization process created an unbalanced development between the urban and rural regions. To solve the gaps between these regions, the government of Vietnam firstly introduced the New Rural Development (NRD) program in 2006 to encourage and mobilize a revolutionary and campaign to improve local infrastructure, living condition, comprehensive development of related-production activities in rural regions, as well as increase income, and improve physical and mental health of people living in rural communities. One of the main purposes of this research paper is aimed at providing a scientific evidence for justifying whether the NRD implementation could have an impact on rural households’ income, one of the ultimate goals of the NRD, and examining the difference of incomes between Saemaul Undong (SU)-piloted provinces with the other provinces by employing a multiple regression model. The analysis results show that the NRD implementation has shown positive results and significant impacts on increasing rural households’ income and improving living conditions at the communal levels. Criteria such as road development, access to electricity, capacity building, and institutional development have significantly influenced on the households’ income. The regression model also indicates that the communes currently implementing SU pilots have a better annual income of 12 million VND (~US$ 530) or 41.8% higher than the other communes."

Excessive deposition of collagen contributes to the development of fibrosis in chronic liver injury. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) plays an important role in fibrogenesis and is accountable for providing extracellular matrix components. The berry of Schisandra chinensis has been known to exert hepatoprotective properties. However, its effect on HSCs is not completely understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of its ethanolic extract (SBE) on hepatic fibrogenesis. We found that SBE treatment effectively reduced the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase as well as collagen deposition in the hepatic parenchyma in a thioacetamide-induced hepatic fibrosis mouse model.Moreover, SBE inhibited transforming growth factor b (TGFb)-induced mRNA expression of a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) and collagen type 1 a1 (COL1A1) in HSCs, suggesting that SBE exerts anti-fibrotic activity by attenuating TGFb-induced HSC activation. To identify the active components of SBE accountable for HSC inhibition, SBE was further partitioned based on the hydrophobicity of the solvents such as water, n-butanol, ethyl acetate, chloroform, and n-hexane. The n-hexane fraction was selected and further separated using analytical high-performance liquid chromatography. We found that six lignans contained in the n-hexane fraction strongly reduced TGFbinduced expression of both aSMA and COL1A1 mRNA.These data suggest that at least six lignans contained in SBE have the strong potential to prevent TGFb-induced HSC activation."

The CPP that consists of three basic subsystems of cognitive-pragmatic sets (CPS) (target, self-identification, instrumental) and evaluative-effective (secondary synthesized) subsystem is considered as a specific, dynamic and transforming cognitive-mental structure that accumulates the personality consciousness work (subject-source – subject-interpreter), where the most important components of cognitive (the system of genetic codes), the conceptual national-specific (system of culture codes) and the linguistic (the system of sign units of different types) of the world are reflected in a highly concise conceptual form and in a special way.K. Kinchev’s CPP is built on a special model. Not a separate basic subsystem of the target installations but a special instrumental-target complex is formed on the basis of the general abstract goal. At the heart of his modeling lies the dialectical duality of the rock poet’s consciousness, based on the unity and struggle of the positive (the target component of the CPS) and the negative (instrumental component of the CPS) beginnings. It is important that the destructive energy of the revolutionary operational-instrumental strategy, based on the principles of total rebellion and destruction, gradually neutralizes (blocks) the positive content of the target component. This naturally leads to a change in its conceptual status from constructive to destructive. As a result, an evaluative-effective instrumental-target CPS complex begins to form in the space of Kinchev’s CPP, within the framework of which the subject-source comes to the self-analyzed conclusion that none of the goals set has been realized. All this leads to a deep spiritual and creative crisis and the realization that the “heroic” version of the CPP has run out of steam and requires a serious modernization of all the basic subsystems."

It was necessary to check internal and external situations where the re-created version after “Korean adaptation” or “Korean transformation” was far superior. The results of the discussion are as follows.First, adaptations from event-oriented to person-oriented played a key role in indigenization. The Three Musketeers combines the original novel with Dix Ans plus tard ou le Vicomte de Bragelonne to dramatically simplify the incident and expand the story of the character individually. Jack the Ripper created a character named Daniel based on the science fiction character, “Crazy scientist,” which was noted during the Victorian era, and reformed Daniel in the typical frame. In the same vein, the tragic life of Daniel’s lover Gloria was also treated with weight, which made Daniel’s monstrosity even more prominent.Second, communication between the stage and the audience has changed at the fundamental level. If the Czech original version created a “transition” layer between reality and dramatic reality to communicate between the stage and the audience, the licensed version elicited an immediate and direct response from the audience with the elements of Kitsch and show. All these factors also allowed us to consider the fundamental changes in subject and stage aesthetics. The Czech original version focuses on an individual and contradictory world, while the licensed version aims for an ideal and orderly cosmos. Eroticism and grotesque were used as stage aesthetics to reveal the orientation of original version, and licensed versions enhance entertainment and lower the level of eroticism and grotesque. The guilt of men who failed to protect women was the basis for a world of ideal and orderly that the right and “faithful” women and ideal men could live in that world.

The Chinese Empire depended on land taxes for more than 70 percent of its tax revenues, but the British Empire had already established a flexible taxation system that could easily finance war expenses by enacting indirect tax into a fiscal workhorse at that time. The shift of center in social production from agriculture to industry and commerce made it possible. The late Qing and Meiji Japan started to develop fiscal expansion and the introduction of new indirect taxes based on the British model. Unlike the successful case of Japan, whose fiscal reform synchronized with the transformation of production, the Qing Empire remained an agricultural economy but increased commercial and industrial tax revenues. During the Republican era, the Peking government and Nanjing Nationalist government tried to escape the indirect tax-dependent tax system by introducing direct taxation, including income tax in consideration of global trends. However, the dependency on indirect tax was deepened without fundamental change in production. After launching its policy of reform and opening, the CCP successfully implemented a series of tax reforms which resembled the unfinished tax reform under the Nationalist regime: the division of national tax and local tax, the introduction of direct taxes, and the abolition of agricultural taxes and salt taxes as a residue of imperial tax system. This success was underpinned by unprecedented economic growth and transition into a highly industrialized economy. However, from the 1980s the U.S. tax system shifted its focus to boosting the economy rather than eliminating social inequality, and consequently China’s tax policy, which has referred to the US model as a global standard, has played a limited role in terms of reducing social inequalities."
Effect of Time-Dependent Pinning Pressure on Abnormal Grain Growth: Phase Field Simulation,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The effect of the time-dependent pinning pressure of precipitates on abnormal grain growth has been investigated by multiphase field simulation with a simple precipitation model. The application of constant pinning pressure is problematic because it always induces abnormal grain growth or no grain growth, which is not reasonable considering the real situation. To produce time-dependent pinning pressure, both precipitation kinetics and precipitate coarsening kinetics have been considered with two rates: slow and fast. The results show that abnormal grain growth is suppressed at the slow precipitation rate. At the slow precipitation rate, the overall grain growth caused by the low pinning pressure in the early stage indeed plays a role in preventing abnormal grain growth by reducing the mobility advantage of abnormal grains. In addition, the fast precipitate coarsening rate tends to more quickly transform abnormal grain growth into normal grain growth by inducing the active growth of grains adjacent to the abnormal grains in the early stage. Therefore, the present study demonstrates that the time dependence of the pinning pressure of precipitates is a critical factor that determines the grain growth mode.</P>"

The article shows that previous studies on the French political economy do not capture the uniqueness of the French state, which serves both international and domestic roles. Notably, the analyzed studies reveal dichotomous views about whether the French economy will stay statist or converge toward neoliberalism. This article holds that the French labor law reform cannot be considered evidence of the French economy moving toward a neoliberalizing model. Instead, the labor market policy was introduced because the French dirigiste state newly developed its domestic roles by adapting to rapidly moving capital and the effects that cascade from this situation. A growing tendency to open domestic politics and the economy was not only pressures to rearrange state roles, but it was also an unexpected chance to strengthen state capabilities. More domestic policies have been made through multilateral negotiation like EU in the French case, and this trend gives the dirigiste state domestic political leverage because the state represents domestic interests on an international negotiating table. Moreover, a strong state can increase interdependence and cooperation with domestic actors by suggesting the possibility of unilateral policy. Lastly, the state can substitute classic economic planning measures with policy framing, which includes the adjustment of the interest structure and the preference order of private actors. The strategy to take lead in policy framing allows a dirigiste state to actualize its will on the process of instituting an international order into a domestic institutional system."
TRRAP stimulates the tumorigenic potential of ovarian cancer stem cells,2018,"['Cancer stem cells', 'Ovarian cancer', 'Spheroid', 'TRRAP']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecological malignancy in women and identification of new therapeutic targets is essential for the continued development of therapy for ovarian cancer. TRRAP (transformation/transcription domain-associated protein) is an adaptor protein and a component of histone acetyltransferase complex. The present study was undertaken to investigate the roles played by TRRAP in the proliferation and tumorigenicity of ovarian cancer stem cells. TRRAP expression was found to be up-regulated in the sphere cultures of A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown of TRRAP significantly decreased cell proliferation and the number of A2780 spheroids. In addition, TRRAP knockdown induced cell cycle arrest and increased apoptotic percentages of A2780 sphere cells. Notably, the mRNA levels of stemness-associated markers, that is, OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, were suppressed in TRRAP-silenced A2780 sphere cells. In addition, TRRAP overexpression increased the mRNA level of NANOG and the transcriptional activity of NANOG promoter in these cells. Furthermore, TRRAP knockdown significantly reduced tumor growth in a murine xenograft transplantation model. Taken together, the findings of the present study suggest that TRRAP plays an important role in the regulation of the proliferation and stemness of ovarian cancer stem cells.

The effects of microstructure transformation in the electrode materials caused by lithium-ion intercalation/deintercalation on the evolution of dynamic responses are investigated including the effects of the state of charge, aging, and cell-to-cell variations. The dynamic responses obtained from a finite element analysis show two interesting phenomena. First, the high modal density is controllable with the design modification of a pack component. Second, dynamic responses, especially the evolution of the natural frequencies of the fixed-boundary modes, of a Li-ion battery pack provide useful information to estimate the dynamic states or health states of the battery. A probabilistic analysis is also carried out considering stochastic operational conditions of hybrid electric vehicles with a parametric reduced-order model. The probabilistic analysis not only suggests appropriate modes and locations for monitoring its dynamic responses, but also determines the maximum response level of every cell in the battery pack.

Kinchev’s cognitive-pragmatic programs (CPP) in terms of the author’s linguoculturological theory of CPP modeling within the Framework of “Heroic” Epoch of Russian Rock Music. The CPP that consists of three basic subsystems of cognitive-pragmatic sets (CPS) (target, self-identification, instrumental) and evaluative-effective (secondary synthesized) subsystem is considered as a specific, dynamic and transforming cognitive-mental structure that accumulates the personality consciousness work (subject-source - subject-interpreter), where the most important components of cognitive (the system of genetic codes), the conceptual national-specific (system of culture codes) and the linguistic (the system of sign units of different types) of the world are reflected in a highly concise conceptual form and in a special way. K. Kinchev’s CPP is built on a special model. Not a separate basic subsystem of the target installations but a special instrumental-target complex is formed on the basis of the general abstract goal. At the heart of his modeling lies the dialectical duality of the rock poet’s consciousness, based on the unity and struggle of the positive (the target component of the CPS) and the negative (instrumental component of the CPS) beginnings. It is important that the destructive energy of the revolutionary operational-instrumental strategy, based on the principles of total rebellion and destruction, gradually neutralizes (blocks) the positive content of the target component. This naturally leads to a change in its conceptual status from constructive to destructive. As a result, an evaluative-effective instrumental-target CPS complex begins to form in the space of Kinchev’s CPP, within the framework of which the subject-source comes to the self-analyzed conclusion that none of the goals set has been realized. All this leads to a deep spiritual and creative crisis and the realization that the “heroic” version of the CPP has run out of steam and requires a serious modernization of all the basic subsystems."

Advanced multigene expression system for Nannochloropsis salina using 2A self-cleaving peptides,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Even though there has been much interest in genetic engineering of microalgae, its progress has been slow due to the difficulty and limitation of available techniques. Currently, genetic modification in most microalgal strains is confined to single gene transformation. Here, a multigene expression system for the oleaginous model strain Nannochloropsis salina was developed with glycine-serine-glycine spacer linked 2A self-cleaving peptides (2A) for the first time. An efficiency test of the four most widely used 2As revealed that two different types of 2As T2A and E2A have the best performance in N. salina with a maximum cleavage rate of nearly 45%. The system was able to express the linked sequence of the selection marker shble and the fluorescence protein sfCherry with intact functions. Because 2A enabled multigene expression in the single cassette form, the use of 2A also reduced the vector size, which along with the stronger promoter resulted in a 9-fold increase in the transformation efficiency. Furthermore, confirmative screening accuracy of more than 90% was observed. Hence, the 2A applied vector system is expected to be beneficial in microalgal research field because it enables multigene expression as well as offering improved transformation and screening efficiency.</P>"

SPIHT Algorithm With Adaptive Selection of Compression Ratio Depending on DWT Coefficients,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In mobile multimedia devices, the frame memory compression (FMC) technique by embedded compression (EC) is becoming an increasingly important video-processing method for reducing the external data bandwidth requirement, which, in turn, results in power savings. Among various EC schemes, the combination of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) is widely used for FMC because it achieves high compression efficiency with low computational complexity. However, there is room for improvement in the conventional DWT and SPIHT algorithm because it compresses all blocks with the same compression ratio without taking into account the correlation between DWT coefficients and the SPIHT algorithm. This study proposes a novel one-dimensional (1-D) DWT and SPIHT algorithm, which enhances the quality of the compressed video by internally applying an adaptive compression ratio for the SPIHT algorithm based on DWT coefficients while keeping the same bit-stream size. The block complexity is predicted from the distribution of DWT coefficients. Then, simple blocks are aggressively compressed with a low compression ratio, while the complex blocks are compressed with a high ratio. Furthermore, to achieve the best video quality, each compression ratio is decided by an optimization technique based on mathematical formulation. Precisely, the logarithm of mean squared error by the SPIHT algorithm is assumed to be linearly correlated with the logarithm of processed DWT coefficients. Experimental results are provided that support the aforementioned model. Compared to the conventional 1-D DWT and SPIHT algorithm, the proposed scheme remarkably improves the video quality by an average of 2.23 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio when the target compression ratio for the SPIHT algorithm is 5/16.</P>"

Porcine Bone Incorporated With 4-Hexylresorcinol Increases New Bone Formation by Suppression of the Nuclear Factor Kappa B Signaling Pathway,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"OBJECTIVE:: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the suppression of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway by 4-hexylresorcinol (4HR), which was activated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in osteoblasts, and new bone formation by 4HR-incorporated porcine bone in an animal model. STUDY DESIGN:: For the confirmation of successful incorporation of 4HR into porcine bone, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) analysis were performed. High performance liquid chromatography was performed for the analysis of the 4HR release profile from porcine bone. MC 3T3-E1 cells were used for the analysis of the NF-kB signaling pathway activation by western blotting and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. New bone formation and the analysis of marker protein expression were studied in a rat calvarial critical-sized defect model. RESULTS:: Both SEM and FT-IR analysis demonstrated successful incorporation of 4HR into porcine bone. Approximately 30% of 4HR was steadily released from porcine bone for 18 days. 4HR suppressed the NF-kB signaling pathway, which was activated by TNF-α application in MC 3T3-E1 cells. Histological analysis revealed that porcine bone particles with incorporated 4HR showed significantly greater new bone formation than those without 4HR at 4 and 8 weeks after operation (P < 0.05). The expression intensities of alkaline phosphatase, osteoprotegerin, and osteocalcin were also higher in the 4HR-incorporated group. CONCLUSION:: The application of 4HR suppressed the NF-kB signaling pathway in osteoblasts and 4HR-containing porcine bone particles promoted new bone formation in a rat calvarial defect model."

Results revealed that the Langmuir isotherm model provided the best fit for As(III) and As(V) sorption, with the sorption affinity following the order: BC700-As(III) > BC700-As(V) > BC300-As(III) > BC300-As(V) (<I>Q</I> <SUB> <I>L</I> </SUB> = 3.85–11.01 mg g<SUP>−1</SUP>). In general, As removal decreased (76–60%) with increasing pH from 7 to 10 except for the BC700-As(III) system, where notably higher As removal (88–90%) occurred at pH from 7 to 9. Surface functional moieties contributed to As sequestration by the biochars examined here. However, significantly higher surface area and aromaticity of BC700 favored a greater As removal compared to BC300, suggesting that surface complexation/precipitation dominated As removal by BC700. Arsenic K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy demonstrated that up to 64% of the added As(V) was reduced to As(III) in BC700- and BC300-As(V) sorption experiments, and in As(III) sorption experiments, partial oxidation of As(III) to As(V) occurred (37–39%). However, XANES spectroscopy was limited to precisely quantify As binding with sulfur species as As<SUB>2</SUB>S<SUB>3</SUB>-like phase. Both biochars efficiently removed As from natural As-contaminated groundwater (As: 23–190 μg L<SUP>−1</SUP>; <I>n</I> = 12) despite in the presence of co-occurring anions (e.g., CO<SUB>3</SUB> <SUP>2−</SUP>, PO<SUB>4</SUB> <SUP>3−</SUP>, SO<SUB>4</SUB> <SUP>2−</SUP>) with the highest levels of As removal observed for BC700 (97–100%).

The identification and characterisation of carbonaceous interface layers of graphene using polarisation-dependent X-ray reflectometry,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The complex refractive index has been determined for graphene for linearly polarised light in p- and s-geometry at energies across the carbon 1s edge. The imaginary part was measured with absorption spectroscopy. The real part was derived using Kramers-Kronig transformations. Results have been validated by X-ray reflectometry of substrate-supported graphene. Theoretical modelling demonstrates that reflection spectra are strongly affected by the relative difference between the reflectance of graphene and its substrate. Measured reflection spectra show that graphene is often sandwiched between a carbonaceous layer of surface-adsorbates and another carbonaceous layer between graphene and substrate. Reflectometry distinguishes adventitious layers from the graphene because of a different energy-dependence of the refractive index. The carbonaceous interface layers can be modelled well with the refractive index function measured for an adventitious surface layer on silicon. The carbon observed at the substrate-interface may originate from the transfer of a graphene sheet from a deposition-substrate. The optically-effective thickness and anisotropy of adventitious carbonaceous layers can be extracted from reflectance spectra. The bonds of adventitious carbon tend to be normal to the basal plane of graphene. Transferred graphene typically has a substrate-interface three times its own thickness and is covered by one layer of surface adsorbates.</P>   <P><B>Graphical abstract</B></P>   <P>[DISPLAY OMISSION]</P>

In the time domain, distance metrics measuring similarities among the time-series data take the estimation results under certain parametric models or autocorrelation structures inherent in each of the processes into account. The frequency-domain approach also plays an important role in time-series clustering analysis by transforming auto-covariance function into spectrum prior to measuring similarities among the processes. However, the previous time-series clustering approaches depend on assumptions of distribution or models. In this study, we apply the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm in which no assumptions are needed. This algorithm enables us to compare two time-series processes in order to measure similarities even when one process is temporally shifted from the other one. We evaluate the performance of DTW and compare with the metrics forementioned via the simulation study. For the real application, we considered the U.S. state-level seasonally adjusted monthly unemployment rate data."

Hydrothermal and thermal annealing methods were employed to do it so. The structure and surface properties of the synthesized aerogel were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), XPS, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements. The prepared n-doped aerogel exhibited elevated specific surface area (340 m2/g), hydrophobic nature, and excellent adsorption capacity (210 g/g for crude oil removal). Adsorbent recyclability was also investigated; it is worth noting that after ten subsequent cycles, only just a negligible decrement in adsorption capacity was observed. Furthermore, the effect of salts and temperature on adsorption capacity was studied. Isotherm and kinetic studies were last examined. The conformity of various adsorption models, including Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) to the equilibrium data was evaluated among which Langmuir isotherm model gave the best fitting result. The sorption kinetics data were well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. As a consequence, oil spills adsorption using n-doped graphene aerogel is a relatively cost-effective method which can be scaled up, and it could be a promising material for removal of organic contaminants from water."

Firstly, the dual-eccentricity model for calculating the transmission error caused by eccentricity errors of gears is presented based on external parallel-axes gear transmission. Then, the tests are carried out at different input speed and initial starts for acquiring transmission error of the designed backlash compensation device, and the eccentricity error of the gear is identified from the testing data of transmission error by curve fitting based on the calculation model. Both the value and phase of the fitting eccentricity error are well coincident with the calculating model. Finally, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is also employed to analyze the value of the eccentricity error. The results of the FFT are closed to the fitting values.

Adaptive Tracking Control of Nonholonomic Mobile Manipulators Using Recurrent Neural Networks,2018,"['Adaptive control', 'backstepping', 'mobile manipulators', 'nonholonomic systems', 'recurrent neural networks']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The trajectory tracking problem is considered for a class of nonholonomic mobile manipulators in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. First, under the assumption that the kinematic subsystem of mobile manipulator is capable of being transformed into the chained form and the dynamic subsystem of mobile manipulator is exactly known without considering external disturbances, a model-based controller is designed at the torque level using backstepping design technology. However, the model-based control may be inapplicable for practical applications, as the uncertainties and disturbances do exist in the dynamics of mobile manipulators inevitably. Thus, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based control system is developed without requiring explicit knowledge of the system dynamics. The control system comprises a RNN identifier and a compensation controller, in which the RNN is utilized to identify the unknown dynamics on-line, and the compensation controller is presented to compensate the approximation error and external disturbances. The online adaptive laws of the control system are derived in the Lyapunov sense so that the stability of the system can be guaranteed. Finally, simulation results for a wheeled mobile manipulator are provided to show the good tracking performance and robustness of the proposed control method."

A novel implementation of the semi-implicit fractional-step method designed for GPU acceleration of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is presented. Aspects of the programing model of Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), which are critical to the bandwidth-bound nature of the present method are discussed in detail. A data layout for efficient use of CUDA libraries is proposed for acceleration of tridiagonal matrix inversion and fast Fourier transform. OpenMP is employed for concurrent collection of turbulence statistics on a CPU while the Navier–Stokes equations are computed on a GPU. Performance of the present method using CUDA is assessed by comparing the speed of solving three tridiagonal matrices using ADI with the speed of solving one heptadiagonal matrix using a conjugate gradient method. An overall speedup of 20 times is achieved using a Tesla K40 GPU in comparison with a single-core Xeon E5-2660 v3 CPU in simulations of turbulent boundary-layer flow over a flat plate conducted on over 134 million grids. Enhanced performance of 48 times speedup is reached for the same problem using a Tesla P100 GPU.</P>"
Predicting the Absorption Potential of Chemical Compounds Through a Deep Learning Approach,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The human colorectal carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) is a commonly used in-vitro test that predicts the absorption potential of orally administered drugs. In-silico prediction methods, based on the Caco-2 assay data, may increase the effectiveness of the high-throughput screening of new drug candidates. However, previously developed in-silico models that predict the Caco-2 cellular permeability of chemical compounds use handcrafted features that may be dataset-specific and induce over-fitting problems. Deep Neural Network (DNN) generates high-level features based on non-linear transformations for raw features, which provides high discriminant power and, therefore, creates a good generalized model. We present a DNN-based binary Caco-2 permeability classifier. Our model was constructed based on 663 chemical compounds with in-vitro Caco-2 apparent permeability data. Two hundred nine molecular descriptors are used for generating the high-level features during DNN model generation. Dropout regularization is applied to solve the over-fitting problem and the non-linear activation. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is adopted to reduce the vanishing gradient problem. The results demonstrate that the high-level features generated by the DNN are more robust than handcrafted features for predicting the cellular permeability of structurally diverse chemical compounds in Caco-2 cell lines.</P>"

Methods: With a cross-sectional survey design, we recruited 94 older women of ages from 65 to 74 at a community setting via convenience sampling. The study participants completed two sets of structured questionnaires (on osteoporosis and fall prevention). Results: The general characteristics of the study participants demonstrated that the women were at high risk for osteoporosis and falls. Overall, the levels of knowledge about osteoporosis and falls, their self-efficacy, and their preventive behaviors were average or slightly above. The relationships between the study variables showed that self-efficacy and healthy behavior, such as doing osteoporosis exercise, eating an osteoporosis diet, and avoiding falls, were related (r=38, p<.001; r=.33, p<.05; r=.26, p<.05). In addition, there were statistically significant relationships between osteoporosis and fall prevention knowledge (r=.37~.46, p<.001), self-efficacy (r=.50~.53, p<.001), and preventive behaviors (r=.50, p<.001). Conclusion: The women's scores on osteoporosis and fall knowledge, self-efficacy, and preventive behaviors suggest an urgent need for the implementation of educational programs for older women. A close relationship between self-efficacy and health behaviors implies a need for transformation of a traditional one-way lecture form."
칼만 필터를 이용한 효율적인 ISAR Cross-Range Scaling Algorithm,2018,"['inverse synthetic aperture radar', 'cross-range scaling', 'Kalman filter', 'least square estimation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, an efficient method is proposed for the cross-range scaling of the inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) image. To estimate the rotation angle (RA) between two ISAR images, polar mapping was performed based on the center of rotation formed at a specific frequency using a two-dimensional Fourier transform. Because the rotational component of the spectrum is represented by translational motion in the polar coordinate, RA can be estimated by the correlation. The estimated RA from the correlation of the 2D spectra generated during the coherent processing interval is optimized by the Kalman filter. Furthermore, the least square estimation minimizes the estimation error. In simulations using the Mig-25 model consisting of isotropic point scattering sources, ISAR images were properly rescaled in (range, cross-range) domain for various signal-to-noise ratios."

Despite extensive studies conducted in the past decades, knowledge gaps still remain in understanding the relationship between pavement macrotexture and surface skid resistance. This paper implements discrete wavelet transform to decompose pavement surface macrotexture profile data into multi-scale characteristics and investigate their suitability for pavement friction prediction. Pavement macrotexture and friction data were both collected within the wheel-path from six High Friction Surface Treatment sites in Oklahoma using a high-speed profiler and a Grip Tester. The collected macrotexture profiles are decomposed into multiple wavelengths, and the total and relative energy components are calculated as indicators to represent macrotexture characteristics at various wavelengths. Correlation analysis is performed to examine the contribution of the energy indicators on pavement friction. The macrotexture energy within wavelengths from 0.97 mm to 3.86 mm contributes positively to pavement friction while that within wavelengths from 15.44 mm to 61.77 mm shows negative impacts. Subsequently, pavement friction prediction model is developed using multivariate linear regressive analysis incorporating the macrotexture energy indicators. Comparisons between predicted and monitored friction data demonstrates the robustness of the proposed friction prediction model."

Robust event-driven tracking control with preassigned performance for uncertain input-quantized nonlinear pure-feedback systems,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>This paper presents a simplified design methodology for robust event-driven tracking control of uncertain nonlinear pure-feedback systems with input quantization. All nonlinearities and quantization parameters are assumed to be completely unknown. Different from the existing event-driven control approaches for systems with completely unknown nonlinearities, the main contribution of this paper is to design a simple event-based tracking scheme with preassigned performance, without the use of adaptive function approximators and adaptive mirror models. It is shown in the Lyapunov sense that the proposed event-driven low-complexity tracker consisting of nonlinearly transformed error surfaces and a triggering condition can achieve the preselected transient and steady-state performance of control errors in the presence of the input quantization.</P>"
Fault diagnosis of an automobile cylinder head using low frequency vibrational data,2018,"['Artificial neural network', 'Automobile', 'Fault diagnosis', 'Fault signature', 'Vibrations']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper proposes a vibration-based fault-diagnosis method for mechanical parts. This method, after algorithm development, only requires a single inexpensive test to inspect the part which could take as short as half a second. The algorithm is developed in three major stages, (i) exciting specimens without or with known faults using a controlled force and recording acceleration of a single point for a short time (ii) finding a signature for each faulty specimen, using Fourier transform and statistical analysis. (iii) Developing a multi-layer perceptron, as a mathematical model, using the results of stage (ii). The elements of a part signature are the inputs to the model. The location (and possibly size and shape factor) of the fault is model output. Stage (i) can be performed experimentally or alternatively with a validated FEM, one experiment or simulation per specimen. The proposed technique was examined to locate (isolate) a fault on an automobile cylinder head. The presented accuracy is considerable, and the data collected at fairly low frequency range (below 1200 Hz) were found to be sufficient for this technique. In the case study of this paper, possible fault locations are on a line; as a result, fault location has one dimension. It is shown that the technique can be extended to higher dimensions."

MMIPGN was synthesized by using morphine as template, fumarate-functionalized goethite nanorods (FFGN) as auxiliary monomer, methcrylic acid (MAA) as functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as a cross linker. The structural properties were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The adsorption behaviors of MMIPGN were monitored under various adsorption conditions such as contact time, pH, the amount of adsorbent and initial concentration of morphine. The selectivity of morphine by MMIPGN was investigated in the presence of foreign species such as epinephrine (Ep), ascorbic acid (Aa), and monoacetylmorphine (Mm) and the value of selectivity coefficients was obtained 1.19, 1.13, and 2.15, respectively.

These are characterized by concepts such as, cell-less architectures, massive spatial processing, tactile response times, big data processing and virtualization. Many groundbreaking technological advances are currently considered as promising enablers for realizing the 5G expectations. To achieve the world’s first commercialization of 5G, mobile communication companies of Korea are preparing or performing dynamic activities including 5G wireless network design. Wireless network analysis and design are very critical processes, because initial network performance and QoS(Quality of Service) of 5G are mainly depend on these. We tried to develop the simulation tool(CellPLAN) for 5G wireless network design referred to 5G pre-New Radio(NR). In this paper, We want to emphasize the importance of Geographic Information System(GIS) in 5G wireless network design. To do this, we listed on the essential information for 5G wireless network design, such as GIS, candidate site information, and propagation model. To focus on the effects of building information(location, shape, height) in 5G wireless network design, we select the sample area and make the possible error intentionally in digital map of CelLPLAN. And we analyzed the difference between original case and error case in the respect of Reference Signal Received Power(RSRP). These works can give a good insight of necessity of one simulation tool to increase reliability and performance in the field of 5G wireless network design and optimization."

Convolutional Neural Networks for Analyzing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Sound,2018,"['UAV', 'acoustics', 'FFT', 'CNNs']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The emergence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is pervasive throughout society. A growing segment of usage is of a dubious nature for harassment, illegal activity and terrorism. Detection of unknown UAV’s has become a requirement for many organizations and agencies to thwart the emergence of UAV’s that are in some way threatening. To detect UAV, the use of acoustic signals has become an useful area of research. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one of several models of deep learning, applied in various fields such as image recognition and natural language processing. In this project, we design a system to detect the presence of possible detection and payload detection using CNNs on the basis of sound data generated from UAV flights. The sound of recorded drones is pre-processed into spectral data by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Mel-Frequency Cepstrum (MFCC) and given as the input value to the CNN model. The results show that it is possible to detect and differentiate UAVs which have standard weight and also with additional payload. In short, the project has two detection goals. One is the acoustic detection of a UAV, and the second is the determination if that UAV has a payload."

Both tobacco and Arabidopsis transgenic plants were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Purification of mAb SO57K from each plant was performed with ammonium sulfate-mediated precipitation and protein A affinity columns. SDS–PAGE analysis showed that the purity of mAb SO57K obtained from each transgenic plant was similar, whereas Arabidopsis showed approximately twofold greater protein expression than tobacco. The N-glycosylation was not significantly different between proteins from the two plant species, with both showing oligo-mannose glycan structures. The mAbs SO57 derived from both the model plants had similar neutralizing efficacy against target virus strain CVS-11. Taken together, tobacco and Arabidopsis are both promising platforms for producing a human anti-rabies mAb."

It builds on a unique research paradigm concerned with combining CLIL and multiliteracies theory in the Japanese tertiary education context (Bradley, 2015; Bradley & Cole, 2016; Bradley, Hunt, & Cole, 2017). Synthesizing research on CLIL methodology and multiliteracies theory, the paper simultaneously manifests and explores a dialogic “thinking model” for examining complex philosophical and ethical issues with students at beginning or intermediate English levels. Faced with the Japanese government demand to offer more content courses or content-based-instruction (CBI) solely in English, we explore the potential of a CLIL-inspired multiliteracies approach, analyzing numerous examples taken from actual classroom experiences that illustrate how such an approach can overcome the lack of critical thinking and critical media literacy among students. This paper contributes to research on CLIL (Coyle, 2008; Koike, 2016) by demonstrating the applicability of a thinking model for teachers working with low-to-intermediate English. It is presented in a dialogic, ’pataphysical format as a way to question the “point of view” of academic research and indeed to transform the practice of academic writing itself."

The AME4 (5 mg/mL of APM) containing 11% Capmul MCM, 38% Smix (Tween80: Propylene glycol (1:1)) and 51% (v/v) water that displayed optical transparency of 99.77%, globule size of 79.50 nm, polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.356 were selected for preparation of MME. The highest diffusion coefficient (P < 0.05) was found for AMME (2.61 × 10−5 ± 0.016 × 10−5 cm2/min) and followed higuchi model. The nasal ciliotoxicity study showed no damage to nasal mucosa and thus the formulation components were considered biocompatible. IR spectra showed no interaction between APM and ME components. Optimized AME and AMME formulations were found to be stable for the period of 6 months. Looking at the results of physicochemical properties and ex vivo studies, it can be concluded that formulated AMME can deliver the APM directly to the brain which has potential of increasing the bioavailability of APM which may alleviate side effects by decreasing the dose and frequency of administration."

The effects of morphology and chemical composition of Ni film on its electrical conductivity were evaluated and described by a quantum mechanical model. It has been found that correlation exists between the theoretical and experimental conductivity of Ni film. Residual stress and phase transformation of Ni silicide as a function of annealing temperature were evaluated using Raman and XRD techniques. Finally, transmission line measurement (TLM) technique was employed to determine the contact resistance of Ni/Si stack after thermal treatment and to understand its correlation with the chemical-structural properties. Results indicated that low electrical resistive mono-silicide (NiSi) phase as low as 5 mΩ.cm2 was obtained."

A nonlinear and serious coupling relationship between the rotation angles and the measured magnetic flux density is established on the basis of the rotation transformation theory and the magnetic field model. In order to get rid of the influence on position detection caused by the harmonics of rotor magnetic field and the stator coil magnetic field, a sensor location combination scheme is proposed.

On the receding contact between a two-layer inhomogeneous laminate and a half-plane,2018,"['receding contact', 'functionally graded coating', 'singular integral equation', 'Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature', 'finite element analysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper considers the smooth receding contact problem between a homogeneous half-plane and a composite laminate composed of an inhomogeneously coated elastic layer. The inhomogeneity of the elastic modulus of the coating is approximated by an exponential function along the thickness dimension. The three-component structure is pressed together by either a concentrated force or uniform pressures applied at the top surface of the composite laminate. Both semianalytical and finite element analysis are performed to solve for the extent of contact and the contact pressure. In the semianalytical formulation, Fourier integral transformation of governing equations and boundary conditions leads to a singular integral equation of Cauchy-type, which can be numerically integrated by Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature to a desired degree of accuracy. In the finite element modeling, the functionally graded coating is divided into homogeneous sublayers and the shear modulus of each sublayer is assigned at its lower boundary following the predefined exponential variation. In postprocessing, the stresses of any node belonging to sublayer interfaces are averaged over its surrounding elements. The results obtained from the semianalytical analysis are successfully validated against literature results and those of the finite element modeling. Extensive parametric studies suggest the practicability of optimizing the receding contact peak stress and the extent of contact in multilayered structures by the introduction of functionally graded coatings."

Carboxymethyl cellulose-based superabsorbent hydrogels containing carboxymehtyl β-cyclodextrin for enhanced mechanical strength and effective drug delivery,2018,"['Carboxymethyl β-cyclodextrin', 'Carboxymethyl cellulose', 'Hydrogel', 'Complexation', 'Swelling ability', 'Tetracycline']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-based hydrogels have superabsorbent properties but low mechanical strength. Variation of other hydrogel components might improve the mechanical strength, but has been occasionally seen to decrease the swelling and drug-loading capacity. To address these problems, we designed a dual-component system, consisting of both carboxymethyl β-cyclodextrin (cmβCD) and CMC. We synthesized the hydrogels by crosslinking βCD or cmβCD with both cellulose (CEL) and CMC to evaluate their intrinsic mechanical strength and swelling capacity. The characteristic structure and morphology of each hydrogel was determined by Fourier- transform infrared spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The storage modulus of the cmβCD/CMC gel was nearly eight-fold higher than that of the CMC gel only in rheology tests; the compressive strength was also enhanced while still retaining high swelling ability. We also investigated the drug-loading capacity and subsequent release properties, using tetracycline as a drug model. The cmβCD/CMC hydrogels showed the most effective tetracycline-loading capacity with the highest antibacterial activity among all hydrogels. They also showed the highest mechanical strength and the best drug release properties apart from the appreciable swelling capacity. Furthermore, cmβCD/CMC hydrogels are non-cytotoxic towards human dermal fibroblasts, suggesting their safe use as nontoxic, bio-friendly, and effective drug delivery systems.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  The superabsorbent CMC-based hydrogel containing cmβCD was successfully synthesized. </LI> <LI>  The storage modulus of cmβCD/CMC gel was about eight-fold higher than CMC gel. </LI> <LI>  The cmβCD/CMC gel obtained displayed high performance in compressive strength. </LI> <LI>  The cmβCD/CMC-based hydrogel enhanced the drug-loading capacity due to complexation. </LI> <LI>  The cmβCD/CMC gel has non-cytotoxicity on human dermal fibroblast cell. </LI> </UL> </P>   <P><B>Graphical abstract</B></P>   <P>[DISPLAY OMISSION]</P>"

A Sensing System of the Halbach Array Permanent Magnet Spherical Motor Based on 3-D Hall Sensor,2018,"['Halbach array', 'PMSM', '3-D hall sensor', 'PSO', 'Gradient projection method']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper proposes a sensing system of the Halbach array permanent magnet spherical motor(PMSM). The rotor position can be obtained by solving three rotation angles, which revolves around 3 reference axes of the stator. With the development of 3-D hall sensor, the position identification problem of the Halbach array PMSM based on rotor magnetic field is studied in this paper. A nonlinear and serious coupling relationship between the rotation angles and the measured magnetic flux density is established on the basis of the rotation transformation theory and the magnetic field model. In order to get rid of the influence on position detection caused by the harmonics of rotor magnetic field and the stator coil magnetic field, a sensor location combination scheme is proposed. In order to solve the nonlinear equation fast and accurately, a new position solution algorithm which combines the merits of gradient projection and particle swarm optimization(PSO) is presented. Then the rotation angles are obtained and the rotor position is identified. The validity of the sensing system is verified through the simulation."

Recently Inter-Korean Summit is open and the new category and orientation of interreligious dialogue and cooperation is needed. This article deals with new directions of building a global civil society by arguing the religious visions of international human rights and the necessity of social welfare practices. Inter-Korean summits and dialogues between religious and non-religious people can be regarded as inter-religious dialogues. Instead of focusing on abstract philosophical discourses on human rights, we should recover the meaning and value of life and overcome social crises on the base of human rights which world religions teach us. In order to fulfill the goals, it examines various models of inter-religious dialogue from traditional conversion oriented model to mutual transformation model. Therefore, in supporting religious minority including North Korean defectors, the balanced approach between human rights and social welfare practices is necessary. The author analyzes subjects of social welfare practices related to human rights and examines religious visions of international human rights and global ethics. In conclusion, the restoration of balance between human rights and social welfare will make us build a global civil society based on religious peace."

"Biogeochemical Characteristics (bioavailability, molecular size and isotopic changes) of Dissolved Organic Matter in the Arbutus Lake Watershed, US",2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"To investigate how biogeochemical processes affect the concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in forested watersheds, the quantity and quality of DOM at the Arbutus Lake Watershed, Adirondack Park (NY, USA) was studied. Spatial and temporal patterns of the quantity (bioavailable/refractory concentrations) and quality (δ13C, aromaticity, and low (LMW; < 1kDa) and high molecular weight (HMW; > 1kDa) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and sulfur (DOS) was investigated. DOC and DON constituents passing through a wetland were composed of highly refractory, aromatic HMW components compared to upland streams. DOS was dominated by the refractory, LMW form. A “bioavailability-molecular size model” was developed showing the refractoriness of the LMW DOS compared to the HMW DOC and DON. Also, isotopic signatures of DOS in the inlet catchment of the Watershed revealed that the incorporation of reduced S (e.g., SH-) derived from bacterial dissimilatory sulfate reduction contributed to generating DOS in ground and surface waters. These results provide new information on mechanisms for geochemical DOS formation in forested catchments. Overall, this study highlighted novel approaches comparing sources and transformation of three elemental DOM fractions of DOC, DON, and DOS along various watershed components and a lake nested forested watersheds."
On the receding contact between a two-layer inhomogeneous laminate and a half-plane,2018,"['receding contact', 'functionally graded coating', 'singular integral equation', 'Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature', 'finite element analysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper considers the smooth receding contact problem between a homogeneous half-plane and a composite laminate composed of an inhomogeneously coated elastic layer. The inhomogeneity of the elastic modulus of the coating is approximated by an exponential function along the thickness dimension. The three-component structure is pressed together by either a concentrated force or uniform pressures applied at the top surface of the composite laminate. Both semianalytical and finite element analysis are performed to solve for the extent of contact and the contact pressure. In the semianalytical formulation, Fourier integral transformation of governing equations and boundary conditions leads to a singular integral equation of Cauchy-type, which can be numerically integrated by Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature to a desired degree of accuracy. In the finite element modeling, the functionally graded coating is divided into homogeneous sublayers and the shear modulus of each sublayer is assigned at its lower boundary following the predefined exponential variation. In postprocessing, the stresses of any node belonging to sublayer interfaces are averaged over its surrounding elements. The results obtained from the semianalytical analysis are successfully validated against literature results and those of the finite element modeling. Extensive parametric studies suggest the practicability of optimizing the receding contact peak stress and the extent of contact in multilayered structures by the introduction of functionally graded coatings."

Aerodynamic stability analysis of geometrically nonlinear orthotropic membrane structure with hyperbolic paraboloid in sag direction,2018,"['membrane structure', 'orthotropy', 'geometrical nonlinearity', 'flow separation', 'aerodynamic instability', 'critical velocity of divergence instability']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper studies the aerodynamic stability of a tensioned, geometrically nonlinear orthotropic membrane structure with hyperbolic paraboloid in sag direction. Considering flow separation, the wind field around membrane structure is simulated as the superposition of a uniform flow and a continuous vortex layer. By the potential flow theory in fluid mechanics and the thin airfoil theory in aerodynamics, aerodynamic pressure acting on membrane surface can be determined. And based on the large amplitude theory of membrane and D'Alembert's principle, interaction governing equations of wind-structure are established. Then, under the circumstance of single-mode response, the Bubnov-Galerkin approximate method is applied to transform the complicated interaction governing equations into a system of second-order nonlinear differential equation with constant coefficients. Through judging the frequency characteristic of the system characteristic equation, the critical velocity of divergence instability is determined. Different parameter analysis shows that the orthotropy, geometrical nonlinearity and scantling of structure is significant for preventing destructive aerodynamic instability in membrane structures. Compared to the model without considering flow separation, it's basically consistent about the divergence instability regularities in the flow separation model."

Chiang Kai-shek’s defeat in the Chinese Civil War was surprising, because Chiang and his Kuomintang forces had enjoyed dominant advantages over Mao in all aspects of military resources. This study intends to (1) present Mao’s management and organizational innovation as a critical factor in the outcome of the conflict, and (2) analyze the success, employing Drucker’s innovation framework.Mao successfully introduced guerilla warfare, a self-directing practice exploiting rapid and flexible changes in battlefields. This transformed Mao’s weaknesses into strengths, incapacitating the enemy’s advantages in military resources, which is the core of Mao’s innovation. Drucker emphasizes that the basis of innovation is to create the future, in which value would be proactively created. In this sense, Mao’s innovation in strategy precisely reflects Drucker.Simple changes in strategies or tactics does not mean successful innovation. Drucker suggests realignment of organizational capabilities and development of managerial and human competencies as a critical condition for successful implementation of innovation. To proliferate guerilla warfare effectiveness, Mao instigated a number of meaningful initiatives to strengthen combatant capabilities. Mao has introduced extensive training and knowledge sharing practices to transform individual soldiers to knowledge workers with independent decision making abilities, a classic case of Drucker innovation model.This study is a first to study Mao’s strategic transformation and implementation from innovation and organizational perspectives, and suggests the possibility that management models may be effectively employed to analyze political organizations at a national level."

Synthesizing research on CLIL methodology and multiliteracies theory, the paper simultaneously manifests and explores a dialogic “thinking model” for examining complex philosophical and ethical issues with students at beginning or intermediate English levels. Faced with the Japanese government demand to offer more content courses or content-based-instruction (CBI) solely in English, we explore the potential of a CLIL-inspired multiliteracies approach, analyzing numerous examples taken from actual classroom experiences that illustrate how such an approach can overcome the lack of critical thinking and critical media literacy among students. This paper contributes to research on CLIL (Coyle, 2008; Koike, 2016) by demonstrating the applicability of a thinking model for teachers working with low-tointermediate English. It is presented in a dialogic, ’pataphysical format as a way to question the “point of view” of academic research and indeed to transform the practice of academic writing itself."

Freud questions the certainty of consciousness which is unquestioned in modern philosophy, and points out that unconsciousness is the basis of true perception. Lyotard follows Freud's position and turns away from Marxism, which is at risk of totalitarian thinking, and introduces psychoanalysis as an alternative to social transformation. This is to eradicate the Western rationalist tradition of returning everything to theoretical discourse, including those that can not be reduced to theoretical discourse. For this reduction is accompanied by distortion and alteration of the reduction. In other words, if the unconsciousness and the form are reduced to the theoretical discourse, the latter exercises oppression and violence to the former. Therefore, we testify that there are things that are not reduced to consciousness and language, and that seeing the world and self as a linguistic world is not a representation of the real world, but rather a local recognition. Furthermore, it will be argued that the unconscious and the non-verbal are more fundamental rather than the conscious and the verbal. In this process, it will be confirmed that the uniqueness, liveliness, and nobleness of the form that can not be expressed in language, that is, the so-called 'exteriority of language', are revived. And also the validity and limitations of Freud and Lacan's model of the relationship between discourse and form as well as the relationship between consciousness and unconsciousness, From this, we would suggest the art which is related to the drive of death as an alternative to psychoanalysis, which is related to the principle of pleasure, as an alternative to avoiding the danger of Hegel’s speculative philosophy. The introduction of the concept of form and drive of death will bring back to art a space of truth that can not be reduced to all discourse and knowledge."

However, he is known for his destructive views on interpretation of the biblical texts, to be evaluated as one “smashing the Old Testament text,” (Charles Darwin) and it caused him to be disgraced by his own church. His unpublished comments on the Book of Revelation, personally acquired by this researcher, are selectively presented and analyzed in this study, and his methodology of interpretation on the biblical texts examined. It was found that he invented words that are not in the text, transformed those which are in the text, and conflated some nouns as identical that are syntactically separated. He foregrounded interpretation with a preteristic model but backgrounded it now and then with a historicistic model. These findings confirm the existing evaluations on his theology. His calculated attempt to break down the inspiration of the Scripture is one of the biggest ironies regarding his philanthropic services as a missionary"

Conventional behavior recognition algorithms have been performed using the 2D camera image device or multi-mode sensor or multi-view or 3D equipment. When two-dimensional data was used, the recognition rate was low in the behavior recognition of the three-dimensional space, and other methods were difficult due to the complicated equipment configuration and the expensive additional equipment. In this paper, we propose a method of recognizing human behavior using only CCTV images without additional equipment using only RGB and depth information. First, the skeleton extraction algorithm is applied to extract points of joints and body parts. We apply the equations to transform the vector including the displacement vector and the relational vector, and study the continuous vector data through the RNN model. As a result of applying the learned model to various data sets and confirming the accuracy of the behavior recognition, the performance similar to that of the existing algorithm using the 3D information can be verified only by the 2D information."

This article examines the theoretical and historical background and the implications of the argument for ‘Citizens’ Assembly’ in the context of ‘Deliberative Democracy’. In 1980s there had been a people’s negative view on direct and participatory democracy, and ‘deliberate transformation’ followed in the 1990s. This global trend and the critics on direct democracy such as ‘Occupation movement’ influenced Korea. The advocates of Citizens’ Assembly argue that meaningful deliberation cannot be expected in direct democracy because of the fatigue of participation and suggest representative body by sortition. However, in order for Citizen’s Assembly to contribute to democracy and political development substantially, public deliberative culture is necessary. Also, since the Citizens’ Assembly can not contain all of the elements of the DD theories, the goal and limitation should be clear in each model of citizen panel in both theory and practice."

Interaction of the Wnt/β-catenin and RAS-ERK pathways involving co-stabilization of both β-catenin and RAS plays important roles in the colorectal tumorigenesis,2018,"['Wnt/β-catenin signaling', 'RAS/ERK signaling', 'Colorectal cancer', 'Crosstalk', 'APC', 'RAS degradation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Cancer development is usually driven by multiple genetic and molecular alterations rather than by a single defect. In the human colorectal cancer (CRC), series of mutations of genes are involved in the different stages of tumorigenesis. For example, <I>adenomatous polyposis coli</I> (<I>APC</I>) and <I>KRAS</I> mutations have been known to play roles in the initiation and progression of the tumorigenesis, respectively. However, many studies indicate that mutations of these two genes, which play roles in the Wnt/β-catenin and RAS-extra-cellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, respectively, cooperatively interact in the tumorigenesis in several different cancer types including CRC. Both <I>Apc</I> and <I>Kras</I> mutations critically increase number and growth rate of tumors although single mutation of these genes does not significantly enhance the small intestinal tumorigenesis of mice. Both <I>APC</I> and <I>KRAS</I> mutations even result in the liver metastasis with inductions of the cancer stem cells (CSCs) markers in a mice xenograft model. In this review, we are going to describe the history for interaction between the Wnt/β-catenin and RAS/ERK pathways especially related with CRC, and provide the mechanical basis for the cross-talk between the two pathways. The highlight of the crosstalk involving the stability regulation of RAS protein via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling which is directly related with the cellular proliferation and transformation will be discussed. Activation status of GSK3β, a key enzyme involving both β-catenin and RAS degradations, is regulated by the status of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling dependent upon extracellular stimuli or intracellular abnormalities of the signaling components. The levels of both β-catenin and RAS proteins are co-regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and these proteins are overexpressed with a positive correlation in the tumor tissues of CRC patients. These results indicate that the elevation of both β-catenin and RAS proteins is pathologically significant in CRC. In this review, we also will discuss further involvement of the increments of both β-catenin and RAS especially mutant KRAS in the activation of CSCs and metastasis. Overall, the increments of β-catenin and RAS especially mutant KRAS by <I>APC</I> loss play important roles in the cooperative tumorigenesis of CRC.</P>"

Even though people in all parts of the society recognize the importance of character restoration, it has been studied mostly in the education field and even by Christian scholars. Biblical character restoration is not just for recovery of morality but the restoration of God’s image and the changes of human character and life as a result of born again in Christ. Biblical character restoration can be examined in three areas such as intellect, emotion and volition. In other words, character restoration shows that people experience the change of values in intellect, love and healing of wounds in emotion, and change of behaviors in volition. In order to achieve the purpose of this study, the researcher uses the methodology of the case study focusing on Wooridle Church in Korea, which we can evidently see the transformation of church members. Based on the case study, the researcher found five distinctive factors such as anti-prosperity message, Words and life sharing mokjang (small group), public confession, discipleship training focusing on QT and self-examination, and discipline. Anti-prosperity message, which rejects prosperity gospel and focuses on bearing the cross, makes congregation change their worldview and values. As a place that provides love and service, mokjangs, which are small groups, help members see themselves objectively and often provide feedback as well. While focusing on QT training, Discipleship training also helps congregation confront their sinful nature and sins. As a unique characteristic of Wooridle Church, public confession makes church members and visitors step into deeper repentance and experience salvation. However, it needs caution and sensitivity in the application in order to avoid side-effects. It is also important that senior pastor practices first in front of the congregation so that they can see the example to follow. Lastly, discipline, which cannot be seen in other churches in modern times, makes the church and its members keep the holiness. According to the case study, they do not work separately but function cooperatively and harmoniously. Wooridle Church is not perfect at all, but it is still valuable in providing lots of insights in relation to character restoration under circumstances that the Korean church is losing credit and power of transformation."

It first traces the general meaning of the word “revolution” and then considers two aspects of the Russian Revolution: the transformation of social orders in the country and its influence on the international relations. After the Russian Revolution an inclusive modernization process according to a new principle has been going in a considerable part of the non-Western world. The author names it “Eurasian Revolution.” The Russian Revolution was the starting point of socialist modernization as an alternative to the Dual Revolution in the West as conceptualized by E. Hobsbawm. Civil and social rights in Soviet Russia were not based on the property ownership. Soviet society pursued a path of modernization different from that of the “bourgeois” society. In its initial phase it achieved the emancipation of the productive power, women’s liberation and the abolition of the discrimination against national minorities. But the socialist modernity of the Soviet society was attained without the political freedom of the members of the society and it resulted in the ‘tutelage dictatorship.’ In the second half of the Soviet period the effect of the emancipation of the productive power disappeared. On the international dimension the Russian Revolution inspired the liberation movement of the peoples of colonial and semi-colonial societies. The Bolsheviks were the most thoroughgoing opponents against the imperialist wars and rules. The Soviet power also assisted the anti-fascist struggles and contributed decidedly to the triumph over the Hitler-Germany. During the 20th century many countries of Asia, Africa and Latin Africa tried to modernize their own society following the Soviet model. The most powerful follower of the Russian Revolution nowadays is China. China and Russia have a cooperative relation. It is based on the common experiences of the both countries proceeding through the 20th century via non-Western path starting from the socialist revolution."

The system has two floating main bodies and twenty rotors. Two bodies are connected with link connection and the ten rotors are attached to each main body. The movement of rotors in waves generates the electric power. This paper investigated time domain dynamic structural responses of the system in waves. Frequency domain wave pressures at bodies and rotors were calculated by HOBEM and the results were converted to time domain forces by inverse Fourier transform. FEM was applied to structural analysis and the main bodies and rotors were modeled by shear-locking-free Mindlin shell elements. The body-rotor connectors were modeled by beam elements. The dynamic equation of motions was solved by Newmark method and main body stresses, body-rotor connector stresses and body-body connector forces were calculated and their result were compared for the different cases of body-to-body angle such as 60 deg or 120 deg. All the results were investigated for different heading angles of waves such as 0~90 deg to compare the responses versus wave directions."

Finally, the story ends with her journey back to the world of the living by obtaining the sacred water to save her parents, thereby acquiring a new position.The roles are transformed as follows: the abandoned one - the nurtured one - the chosen one - the chooser - the working one - the enduring one - the gainer - the helper - the savior - and the God who leads to the next world. Moreover, these characteristics can be summarized as the abandoned - the victim - the doer - the responsible person - and the giver. She sublimated her role in the higher power as a Goddess for human sympathy.Based on her experiences, Princess Bari undergoes different stages of emotional change: deep shame and feeling lost; feeling healthy and recovering self-esteem; mutual love; feeling fulfilled. At the final stage, she turns into a sacred symbol of dedication and sacrifice. The first two stages correspond to the human emotion; the two middle stages are the necessary transitive stages to the divine world; and the final stage presents the divine image.Princess Bari’s story highlights various characteristics necessary for a good therapist, such as empathy, resonance, witnessing, and intervention. Her experience of being abandoned and her position as a princess provides her a wide spectrum of understanding of people. In addition, she developed her skills to maintain a balance between witnessing and intervention from her experience of “working and enduring.” Most importantly, her story suggests that feeling mentally stable and the recovery of feeling loved based on her physical experience reinforces her strength as a therapist."

Appreciative understanding of other religions has become widespread, and criticism of Christian arrogance and imperialism is commonplace.

And this paper survey the different responses among the world Christian; the conservative Evangelism, World Council of Churches (WCC), and the third world Church in Asia and Africa.The second part of this essay summarizes recent theological discussion and attitudes on the meaning of our pluralistic situation; Three patterns are exclusive pattern, inclusive pattern, and pluralistic pattern. And then proceeds to critical evaluation and constructive theological statement. The third part of this paper intends to survey the pluralistic approach to other religions, in which John Hick claims the idea of ‘opernican revolution’, consisting in a paradigm shift from a Christ-centered model to a God-centered model of faith. Then we could see the great world religions as a different human reponses to see the One divine Reality. The Christian pluralism claims that God as the Holy Spirit has worked in other religious communities through other persons and images, so that mutual respect should now displace the religious superiority as well as imperialism toward mutual growth and creative transformation. Authentic religious pluralism also criticizes so called syncretism, a mixture of religions which destroys the spiritually dynamic greatness in each of the world religions. Regarding with encounter with other religions, the most important approach is ‘orthopraxis’ way, but not ‘orthodoxy’ one."

It deals with the salvation of all the believers, its scope is global, and its workers used for missions are diverse and very professional. A common thing that is found among them is found within Jesus Christ. They have in common that they have utilized all their functions as professionals for the gospel of Christ. The fact that Jesus lived as a professional carpenter and prepared a public career means that anyone can be used as a professional missionary in God's redemption mission with one's professional career. Therefore, when we look at the Bible in this perspective, we can find many professional missionaries in it. Nevertheless, there was a time in Christian mission history when preaching the gospel was regarded only as an exclusive possession of the priesthood. These thoughts have long misunderstood God's will to make effective missions through professional ministry. In addition, this tendency, unfortunately, has led up to Korean churches today. We cannot be congested any longer. We must return to the original mission model that God has intended. There can be no distinction of priesthood or laity before the Great Commission of World Evangelization. There can be no reason or excuse for Christians to turn away from the mission and the calling of professional ministry. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the transformation of the mission paradigm so that all believers can write the 'New' Acts with a professional missionary identity. For this purpose, starting from biblical times, we will look at the history of professional ministry in each era. Through this, we will reveal the basis of professional ministry and that the characters of the New and Old Testament in the Bible, and the advanced believers who lived in each church history, was used without distinction of gender or profession for the Gospel. Also, as they did, we will look at the inevitability of today's Christian mission to return to the original missionary model: professional mission. In addition, we will suggest the appropriateness and inevitability of professional mission in modern mission strategy which is in need of more effective missions."

FACTORS INFLUENCEING CHINESE CONSUMERS’ GREEN PURCHASE BEHAVIOR: AN EXAMINATION AND EXTENSION OF THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR (TPB),2018,"['green product', 'PCE', 'price', 'purchase behavior', 'information', 'PBC']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Introduction With awareness of the importance of environmental protection, encouragement of green consumption has been an important part of the Chinese government's efforts to promote sustainable development. Green consumption is similar to the concept of environmental responsible consumption, which refers to individual’s behavior with a consideration of the environmental impacts in the process of purchasing, using and disposing of various products, or use of various green services (Stern, 1999). Previous studies tried to predict pro-environmental behavior with social-psychological factors, such as values, attitudes and beliefs. However, researches about the relationship between environmental attitudes and behaviors do not produce consistent results. Some prove that they are positive related, and others argue that their relationship is very weak. Studies have testified that lots of consumers declare that they concern about the environmental situation, but hesitate to pay for green products due to this affect (Chang, 2011). Advancing knowledge about the motivations and obstacles that shape intention and behavior of green consumption is important. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991) is appropriate as an initial framework for studies investigating consumers’ pro-environmental behaviors. With the inclusion of a new construct perceived behavioral control, the explanatory ability of this model is strengthened. However, simple adoption of this model does not give us deep insight into consumers’ behavior. Later studies apply TPB in different contexts (e.g. Paul, Modi, Patel, 2016; Mancha & Yoder, 2015; Han, Hsu, Sheu, 2011). The mechanism of how attitude, norms and perception of behavioral control are formed may differ in different circumstances, which is still under research especially in China. The purpose of this paper is to (a) identify applicability of TPB model in predicting green purchasing intention and behavior in China and capture which factor including attitude, perceived behavioral control and norm is the most influential determinant; (b) to examine the most useful psychological and situational antecedents, which indirect influence consumers’ green purchase behavior through the factors in TPB framework. Literature Review and Hypothesis Development Green products refer to those produced with consideration of less harm to the ecological environment such as air, water and land. Green purchase behavior should be considered as a typical socially conscious behavior that is different from other types of consumer behaviors, which can deliver instant personal gain and gratification (Kim & Choi, 2005). Most of the time, pro-environmental purchasing is future-oriented and benefits society as a whole (Author, Mccarty, & Shrum, 2001). Previous research models seek to explain green purchase behavior from two aspects of causal factors. Some emphasize intra-personal determinants from within and others may stress that from outside. However, a single consideration of any one set of these factors will weaken the interpretation of consumers’ green consumer behavior. The research model of this study is based on the most influential TPB framework. Some significant psychological and situational factors are integrated into the framework with the purpose of further understanding Chinese consumers’ purchase behavior. Theory of planned behavior According to the TPB model, individual’s decision making is oriented by a rational evaluation of behavioral consequences (Bamberg & Moer, 2007). The intention to perform a behavior, is considered as the central factor in the TPB model (Tarkiainen & Sundqvist, 2005). Attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm about the behavior, and perceived behavioral control regarding the performance of the behavior are three principal factors that determine behavioral intention. H1: Intention to buy green product has a positive relationship with the green purchase behavior. Attitude refers to individuals' beliefs about the outcomes of the behavior together with an evaluation of the importance of these outcomes. Consumers who feel positive toward green products and have agreement on their environmental goodness will most likely to consider buying products with pro-ecological features. H2a: Attitude toward buying green product is positively associated with the intention to perform green purchase behavior. Subjective norm refers to the responses of important reference group (e.g. family members, close friends) to a particular behavior. Some scholars argue that “subjective norm” is the weakest component in the TPB model when predicting behavioral intentions due to its feature of both self and social interest (Armitage & Conner, 2001; Bagozzi et al., 2000). In this study, “moral norm” instead of “subjective norm” is proposed as a direct predictor of intention toward green purchasing. Moral norm indicates individual’s perception that whether performing a certain behavior is morally correct or not (Ajzen, 1991). H2b: Moral norm regarding buying green product is positively associated with the intention to perform green purchase behavior. Perceived behavioral control is an individual’s perception about if performing a particular behavior is easy or difficult. People tend to be more involved in behaviors that are considered to be easier to realize than what they think is difficult and have less control (Bamberg & Moer, 2007). H2c: PBC of buying green product is positively associated with the intention to perform green purchase behavior. Psychological antecedents of attitude Environmental concern indicates consumers' awareness about environmental issues and people’s worry that the human intervention will have threat to the environment (Kim & Choi, 2005). Literatures reveal an indirect relationship between ecological affect and actual behavior. Bang et al. (2000) concludes that environmental concern has indirect effect on purchase intention through the influence of consumer’s attitude toward paying a premium for renewable energy. The emotional responses to ecological problems help consumers to create a positive attitude toward green purchase behavior. H3a: Environmental concern is positively associated with the attitude toward green purchase behavior. Environmental knowledge represents consumers’ understanding of the environmental conditions, as well as fundamental factors that contribute to environmental change and crucial ecological effects (Pagiaslis & Krontalis, 2014). Knowledge has impact for individual’s cognitive processing. Zhao et al. (2014) confirms knowledge as one of the factors that form people’s attitudes toward environment-friendly behavior. Compared with less knowledgeable consumers, those who have more environmental knowledge incline to be more concerned about the environment, which in turn leads consumers to take attention to products’ ecological features while purchasing (Kim, Park, & Schwarz, 2010). H3b: Perceived environmental knowledge is positively associated with attitude toward green purchase behavior. In the pro-environmental behavior domain, PCE indicates to what extent consumers feel that every single person can contribute to solve environmental problems through their own efforts and their everyday purchase behavior (Straughan & Roberts, 1999).With the absence of belief that individual’s actions have observable outcome in making different solution to a problem, people will hesitate to take into action. Kim and Choi (2005) conclude that PCE has indirect effect on green purchasing through the role of ecological sensitive attitudes. H3c: PCE is positively associated with attitude toward green purchase behavior. Moral norm and subjective norm Bamberg and Moer (2007) suggest that people make use of subjective norms to determine whether a specific behavioral choice is easy to perform or whether it is beneficial. The opinions from “important others” deliver the standards for people to conform when they encounter the same situation. That is, the views about what is right or wrong from reference group will be absorbed and transformed as one’s personal moral norms (Bamberg & Moer, 2007). H4: Subjective norm is positively associated with moral norm regarding green purchase behavior. Situational factors influencing PBC Perceived availability indicates if consumers feel they can easily obtain or consume a certain product. If green products are not easy available, most consumers will not spend too much time and effort for searching. The limited availability and inconvenience in obtaining products is bound to hamper green products purchasing (Vermeir & Verbeke, 2006). H5a: Perceived availability of green product is positively associated with PBC regarding green purchase behavior. Perceived price is one of the most important factors that have impact on consumers’ decision-making of green consumption (Osterhus, 1997). Green products are generally priced higher than conventional products. However Chinese consumers who would like to pay a large premium are still in the minority. The perceived high price is a barrier that influences consumers’ perceived capability over green purchase behavior. H5b: Perceived price of green product is negatively associated with PBC regarding green purchase behavior. Information has an impact on individual’s cognitive process. It is an influential factor that leads consumer behavior change (Bator & Cialdini, 2000). Atkinson and Rosenthal confirm that eco-labels have effects on consumer’s trust and purchase intention. If consumers feel hard to recognize eco-labels and cannot understand their difference with regular ones, their perception of control will be highly influenced and the green purchase may be hindered. H5c: Perception of information provided by eco-label is positively associated with PBC regarding green purchase behavior. Methodology This research adopted the survey approach for data collection. A questionnaire that consisted of 46 items was designed according to relevant previous studies. All the items in the questionnaire use five-point Likert scale, which ranging from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (5). The target group of this study was consumer who is over 18 years old in the urban areas of Mainland China. An online survey was conducted for collecting data in the mid-October, 2017 and 500 samples were collected totally. After removing the disqualified questionnaires, 485 questionnaires were identified as eligible for further analysis. To testify the proposed hypotheses, the simple and multiple linear regression analyses using IBM SPSS Statistics was primarily adopted in the study. Meanwhile, the structural equation modeling (SEM) was also conducted as an alternative approach to examine the arguments. Results Firstly, the theory of planned behavior suggested by Ajzen (1991) was proved to be applicable in the green purchasing circumstance. Attitude was identified to play the most significant role in predicting the intention. The construct “moral norm” was resulted to be more predictable for green purchase intention compared with the original “subjective norm”. It indicates that in certain contexts, personal feeling of moral obligation or responsibility is more crucial and direct reason for consumer conducting ethical behaviors. Perceived behavioral control was testified as the third prediction of purchase intention. The proportion of variance explained (R2=0.546) for intention was even better compared with previous studies, which claimed that the three determinants account for between 40% and 50% of the variance in intention (Ajzen, 1991; Amireault et al., 2008; Conner & Armitage, 1998). This model revealed consumers’ mental development of their purchase intention before enacting the buying behavior. Secondly, the results testify that PCE plays as the central role in predicting attitude. Respondents who believe that their consumptions can help to reduce environmental deterioration will be much likely to hold positive attitudes toward green purchasing. Environmental concern and perceived knowledge have a considerable, but only indirect impact on consumers’ attitude. Implications for practice The results of this study suggest that consumers’ intentions to buy green products are directly predicted by attitude, moral norm and their perceived behavioral control. Firstly, enterprises in the green market need to adopt effective communication strategy to inform consumers about the advantages of environmentally friendly products in order to help consumers to develop a positive attitude to pro-environmental products. Moreover, due to the significant effect of PCE on consumer attitude, it's necessary for the government to quantify the effect of green consumption by real cases and data, so that people can perceive the effectiveness of green buying behavior in a more intuitive way. Meanwhile, companies should take more emphasis on consumer’s ability to solve the problem in a positive manner in marketing communications. Secondly, personal moral norm is also found to have direct effects on purchase green products. Thus, normative appeal is needed for creating consumers' emotional connection and should be presented in the promotion programs to stimulate green consumption. Thirdly, this study reveals that the availability is the main factor that affects consumers’ perceived behavioral control over green purchasing."

This paper proposes a new model named joint moment-matching autoencoders(JMA). This model learns to perform cross-domain transformation over multiple domains based on perceptual loss and maximum mean discrepancy criteria, in the absence of any paired images between the domains. Our results show that the proposed JMA framework successfully learns to transform images between domains without any paired data.

Prediction of remaining useful life under different conditions using accelerated life testing data,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Prognostics methods model the degradation of system performance and predict remaining useful life using degradation data measured during service. However, obtaining degradation data from in-service systems in practice is either difficult or expensive. Therefore, accelerated life testing (ALT) is instead frequently performed for validating designs using considerably heavy loads. This work discusses the methods and effectiveness of utilizing ALT degradation data for the prognostics of a system. Depending on the degradation model and loading conditions, four different ways of utilizing ALT data for prognostics are discussed. A similar transformation method used in ALT is adopted to convert accelerated loading conditions to field loading conditions. To demonstrate the proposed approach, synthetic data are generated for crack growth under accelerated loading conditions; these data are used for training a neural network model or identifying model parameters in a particle filter. The applied example shows that the use of ALT data increases the accuracy of prognostics in the early stages in all four cases and compensates for the problem posed by data insufficiency through the proposed method.</P>"

In other words, I analyzed and compared the integrated models proposed by the literature to simultaneously improve the effects of climate adaptation and development cooperation in developing countries. The historical background of each model, the content and significance of the model, and its limitations were evaluated. In academia, adaptation appeared to have paradigmatic competition with development in 4 proposed models including one of development elements (Climate Proofing), a chemical combination with development (Community-based Adaptation), a facilitator role in promoting the effects of sustainable development (Sustainable Adaptation), and a role in liberating the subjugated class in the developmental process (Critical Adaptation). Developing countries have a choice of adaptive approaches to reduce epistemic uncertainty or to reduce power-structural inequalities, depending on the political realities that can be realized. It includes realistic epistemology (Climate Proofing), ideal epistemology (Community-based Adaptation), realistic power structure theory (Sustainable Adaptation), and ideal power structure theory (Critical Adaptation). At present, the mainstream is Sustainable Adaptation Model, suggesting transformative adaptation as an alternative to finding the root cause of vulnerability in the imbalance of power structure. The theory of Climate Change Adaptation is expected to develop into an independent realm with the mainstream model, but Critical Adaptation holds a critical view on the conceptual ambiguity of ‘transformation’ and its top-down viewpoint."

However, the port choice attributes of land-side decision makers may have both linear and non-linear properties. This study attempts to confirm the nonlinear characteristics of choice attributes for land-side decision makers using the Kano model and develops a related strategy using importance-performance map analysis. The findings show that the port choice properties of shippers and freight forwarders, which are not clearly distinguished in the case of general research or policy establishment, may have significantly different nonlinear factors and characteristic forms. The port service providers have to develop and execute strategies or policies to improve performance based on the port selection factors of the shippers and freight forwarders; these factors are located in the one-dimensional characteristics of the Kano model and the concentrated improvement area of the importance-performance map analysis. First, according to the analysis of the shippers’ recognition of the port of Gwangyang, the shippers regard the ""port and terminal size"" attribute as a one-dimensional characteristic attribute of the Kano model but evaluate it as below the average in the importance-performance map analysis. The port service providers must transform the excessive effort for shippers such as ""container box supply,"" ""empty container box management,"" ""diversity of connection routes,"" and ""access to inland transportation network"" to ""port and terminal size"" to increase the overall choice demand and satisfaction of Gwangyang port. Secondly, in the case of freight forwarders, the attributes of ""empty container box management"" and ""diversity of connection routes"" belong to the concentrated improvement area with low-performance level compared to the importance. The port service providers can also improve the degree of selection behavior and overall satisfaction of freight forwarders by focusing their efforts on the attributes of one-dimensional characteristics in the Kano model as well as concentrating on the importance-performance map analysis. Therefore, the port service providers such as government, port authority, and terminal operating companies, should develop and run a port operation strategy that reflects the characteristics of port choice factors of each land-side decision maker. Since this study aims at exploring the form of port choice characteristics of shippers and freight forwarders in Gwangyang port, long-term additional verification studies on ports and stakeholders located domestically and abroad are required."

And second, what is the organization’s full effect, direct effect, indirect effect that has certain impact on PTL, LO, SOE? The research concludes that first, PTL does have an impact on LO, and as follows, LO on  SOE, PTL on SOE. And second, PTL has direct effect on LO, and as follows, LO on organizational effectiveness, PTL on organizational effectiveness. P<.001).And PTL has indirect effect of .342 on  LO, but  it’s full effect on SOE using LO as a mediacy is of .991 showing its certain influence. In conclusion, PTL has effect on  LO, and as follows, LO on SOE , PTL on SOE. The effect PTL has on SOE is greater than that of LO on SOE. However if the principal exhibits transformational leadership and promotes the LO ,then SOE goes by far greater. PTL not only has direct effect on SOE, but also has indirect effect on it by LO. Therefore if principal wants the SOE elevated, he/she has to exhibit certain transformational leadership while applying LO on school. To suggest couple of things in order to improve further research and education on field based on this result is to, first, it is easier to collect objective data if the follow up study covers the extended region. Second, we urge the follow-up research with the extension of the model including emotional leadership that has been currently studied as leadership theory and morale leadership including variables and dependent variables from a variety of perspectives.

Anisotropic yield function based on stress invariants for BCC and FCC metals and its extension to ductile fracture criterion,2018,"['Plastic anisotropy', 'Stress invariant', 'Body-centered cubic', 'Face-centered cubic', 'Lode parameter', 'Lode angle', 'Normalized third stress invariant', 'Stress triaxiality', 'Metal forming']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>It is essential to accurately model the anisotropic plastic deformation and ductile fracture of metals in order to guarantee the reliable numerical analysis and optimization of metal forming. For this purpose, the Drucker function is revisited. Effect of the third stress invariant in the Drucker function is analyzed and calibrated for metals with body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal systems based on the yielding and plastic flow of both crystal plasticity and biaxial tensile experiments. The calibrated Drucker function is extended into an anisotropic form using a fourth order linear transformation tensor. The anisotropic flexibility is enhanced by two approaches: non-associate flow rule (non-AFR) and the sum of n-components of the anisotropic Drucker function. The proposed anisotropic Drucker function is applied to model the anisotropic behavior of both BCC and FCC metals. The predicted anisotropic behavior is compared with experimental results. The comparison demonstrates that the anisotropy is accurately modeled for both BCC and FCC metals by the anisotropic Drucker function. The anisotropic Drucker function is also implemented into numerical analysis of tension of specimens with a central hole to investigate its computation efficiency under spatial loading compared with the Yld2000-18p function. It is found that the proposed anisotropic Drucker function can reduce about 60% of computation time in case that the Yld2000-18p function is substituted by the anisotropic Drucker function in numerical computation due to its simplicity compared to the Yld2000-18p function. A ductile fracture criterion is also developed by coupling the Drucker function with the first stress invariant. The modified Drucker function is reformulated to investigate the effect of the stress triaxiality and the normalized third invariant on ductile fracture. Comparison of the modified Drucker fracture locus with the experimental results of AA2024-T351 demonstrates that the modified Drucker criterion accurately illustrates the fracture stress of the alloy in wide stress states with the stress triaxiality ranging from −0.5 in plane strain compression to 0.6 in tension of notched specimens. The modified Drucker fracture criterion is expected to be less sensitive to the change of strain path considering that the criterion describes fracture in the stress space. Accordingly, the anisotropic Drucker yield function and the pressure-coupled Drucker fracture criterion are suggested to model anisotropic plastic deformation and to predict the onset of failure for both BCC and FCC metals due to simple implementation in numerical analysis under spatial loading and computation efficiency with brick elements.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Drucker function is extended into anisotropy using linear transformation tensor. </LI> <LI>  Anisotropic flexibility is enhanced by two approaches: non-AFR and sum of n-components of the anisotropic Drucker function. </LI> <LI>  Comparison demonstrates that anisotropy is accurately modeled for BCC and FCC metals by the anisotropic Drucker function. </LI> <LI>  The enhanced Drucker function can model anisotropy of BCC and FCC metals easily numerical analysis under spatial loading. </LI> <LI>  Drucker function has been extended to ductile fracture criterion with high accuracy from compressive to tension. </LI> </UL> </P>"

The main contributions of this study are the following: 1) A PSIM-based macro-model was employed because it is remarkably fast, has high precision, and has no convergence issues. 2) Three types of equivalent macro-models were developed for the transformation of a small PV sub-array with uniform irradiance to a new macro-model. 3) On the basis of the proposed new macro-model, a tearing method was established, which can divide a large-scale PV array into several small sub-arrays to significantly improve the efficiency improvement of a simulation. 4) Three platforms, namely, PSIM, PSpice, and MATLAB, were applied to evaluate the proposed tearing method. The proposed models and methods were validated, and the value of this research was highlighted using an actual large-scale PV array with 2420 PV modules. Numerical simulation demonstrated that the tearing method can remarkably improve the simulation efficiency by approximately thousands of times, and the method obtained a precision of nearly 6.5%.

Behavior and stress check of concrete box girders strengthened by external prestressing,2018,"['bridge strengthening', 'external prestressing', 'spatial grid model', 'stress check', 'concrete crack', 'principal stress']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The deterioration of existing bridges has become a major problem around the world. In the paper, a new model and an associated stress checking method are proposed for concrete box girders strengthened by external prestressing. The new model called the spatial grid model can analyze all the spatial behaviors clearly by transforming the box girder into discrete orthogonal grids which are equivalent to plate elements. Then the three-layer stresses are employed as the stress checking indices to evaluate the stress state of the plate elements. The initial stress check before strengthening reveals the cracked and potential cracking areas for existing bridges, making the strengthening design more targeted and scientific; the subsequent stress check after strengthening evaluates the strengthening effect and ensures safety. A deficient bridge is selected as the practical example, verifying the accuracy and applicability of the proposed model and stress checking method. The results show that principal stresses in the middle layer of plate elements reflect the main effects of external prestressing and thus are the key stress checking indices for strengthening. Moreover, principal stresses check should be conducted in all parts of the strengthened structure not only in the webs. As for the local effects of external prestressing especially in the areas near anchorage and deviator, normal stresses check in the outer and inner layers dominates and local strengthening measures should be taken if necessary."

In the similar vein, the scholars and researchers in academia have aimed at sorting and categorizing individual stories into the types of plot structures as a whole. Accordingly, the process of story-building has received relatively less attention.Although the recent story classification theories and models have academic values—and since their methodologies are overly deductive and systematic—content developers found it difficult to put them into practice and use them with flexibility. Also notable was the difficulties of classification. The process of sorting and classifying stories based on the present models are often plagued with ambiguity and inconsistency in interpretation and application.As an alternative and viable means of offering practical solutions, this paper proposes a motif-based model that can account for story-building elements and writing process of folk-tales and that can assist content developers in creating a story, based on Stith Thompson’s Motif Index of Folk-literature. The motif sources of the index are retrieved from various folk-tales, ballads, myths, and legends around the world. With Thompson’s Motif Index, we illustrate the ways to utilize the motifs by examining some culturally distinct, if narratively similar, folk-tales including the Grimm brothers’ “Little Red Riding Cap,” Charles Perrault’s “Little Red Riding Hood,” and Aesop’s “The Wolf and the seven young kids.” In addition, we present the examples of using the motif-based model with some commercial advertisements such as Levis, Moccona, and AT&T."

A genre custom that an oral traditions and literature on Gyunyeo, a folk belief myth, a confucian strange biography, Buddhism priest story etc. premised and made. So Gyunyeojeon had an aspect of complex genre. Second, it is confirmed a narrative literature characteristic of Gyunyeojeon. Gyunyeojeon is collected various literature tradition, so it had an its own characteristic. Actually Gyunyeojeon is used a nonfiction and fiction, it has a new aspect different from existing work. And then it arranged a transformation literary song and romantic Chinese poem, so a tales of character of Confucianism and Buddhism had together. Furthermore it had a characteristic of a work in work that Gyunyeo’s Sanoega and its introduction, Choehaenggwi’s translate song and its introduction. It could be possible that a tradition of another genre using actively in transformation literature or strange biography. Third, Gyunyeojeon’s narrative literature meaning is considered diachronically.

Influence Analysis of Power Grid Harmonics on Synchronous Hydro Generators,2018,"['Average torque', 'Bulb tubular turbine generator', 'Eddy current loss', 'Harmonic current', 'Time harmonic', 'Torque ripple']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The content of harmonic current increases with an increase in the number of power electronic devices in power grid. When a generator is directly connected to the power grid through a step-up transformer, the influence of the harmonic currents on the generator is inevitable. To study the influences of harmonics on generators, a 24-MW bulb tubular turbine generator is taken as an example in this paper. A 2-D transient electromagnetic field model is established. Through a comparative analysis of the data of experiments and simulations, the correctness of the model is verified. The values of the air gap magnetic density, torque and losses of the generator under various conditions are calculated using the finite element method. Taking the rated condition as a reference, the influence of the harmonic currents on the magnetic flux density is analyzed. It is confirmed that the time harmonic is a key factor affecting the generator performance. At the same time, the effects of harmonic currents on the torque ripple, average torque and eddy current loss of the generator are studied, and the mechanism of the variation of the eddy current loss is also discussed."
확장된 DEVS 형식론 기반 페더레이션의 변환을 통한 C3 복합 체계의 분석 방법,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"The system of systems (SoS) based analysis method for the C3 system consisting of the communication system and the command and control (C2) system has the advantage that detailed analysis is possible, but it requires long execution time per one trial, which makes the analysis of various scenarios difficult. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method for analysis of C3 SoS using a transformation of a federation into an integrated simulation. This transformation technique reduces the execution time while maintaining accuracy by abstracting the system other than the one to be analyzed, consisting of model hypothesis and function identification. The former can construct an abstracted model for the simulation through the proposed extended Discrete Event Systems Specification (DEVS) formalism and the latter can express the characteristics of the model influenced by other systems. From the case study on C and C2 analysis, the experimental results show that this method shortened the time considerably while maintaining the accuracy within an acceptable error range and we expect that this method will enable the exploratory analysis of the complex systems other than C3."
Coupling of the 2D microtopography of tooth surface and transmission error,2018,"['Spur gear', 'Microtopography', 'Monte Carlo simulation', 'Transmission error', 'Coordinate transformation method']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper provides a method coupling the 2D microtopography filtered by ISO Gaussian filter of spur gears, which is typically used in power transmission devices, and Transmission error (TE) together. A gearbox with certain transmission ratio is selected as a research object for analysis. This gearbox comprises a mathematical model of TE calculation based on the Monte Carlo method and the coordinate transformation method, which couples the 2D microtopography of spur gears and TE. Two TE models are established to study their effects on the coupling results: a) The single TE model, which means only one gear owns TE, and b) the synthetic TE model, which means both gears possess TE. The new model of the 2D microtopography of tooth surfaces can be utilized further to investigate the mechanism of engagement and the approximate contact position of asperities on the tooth surface. The new model is also significant in studying the tooth root bending stress."

Therefore, this study explores the educational implication of suffering as the main source for the transformative self for our learners. Such a perspective will contribute to the public model of religious education, transcending the conventional boundary between the sacred and the secular."
Full waveform inversion using a decomposed single frequency component from a spectrogram,2018,"['Spectrogram', 'Full waveform inversion', 'Spectral decomposition', 'Spectrogram inversion']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Although many full waveform inversion methods have been developed to construct velocity models of subsurface, various approaches have been presented to obtain an inversion result with long-wavelength features even though seismic data lacking low-frequency components were used. In this study, a new full waveform inversion algorithm was proposed to recover a long-wavelength velocity model that reflects the inherent characteristics of each frequency component of seismic data using a single-frequency component decomposed from the spectrogram. We utilized the wavelet transform method to obtain the spectrogram, and the decomposed signal from the spectrogram was used as transformed data. The Gauss–Newton method with the diagonal elements of an approximate Hessian matrix was used to update the model parameters at each iteration. Based on the results of time–frequency analysis in the spectrogram, numerical tests with some decomposed frequency components were performed using a modified SEG/EAGE salt dome (A–A′) line to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed inversion algorithm. This demonstrated that a reasonable inverted velocity model with long-wavelength structures can be obtained using a single frequency component. It was also confirmed that when strong noise occurs in part of the frequency band, it is feasible to obtain a long-wavelength velocity model from the noise data with a frequency component that is less affected by the noise.

The study results can be summarized as below.First, based on 『Jieziyuan Huazhuan(芥子園畵傳)』, the introductory book of tree expression delivered from China in the 17th century, <Donggwoldo> allowed the classification criteria of the trees described in the picture to be established and helped identify their types. As a result of the classification, there were 10 species and 50 trees in the Donhwamun Gate area of <Donggwoldo>.Second, it was possible to measure the real size of the trees described in the picture through the elevated drawing scale of <Donggwoldo>. The height of the trees ranged from a minimum of 4.37 m to a maximum of 22.37 m. According to the measurement results, compared to the old trees currently living in Changdeokgung Palace, the trees described in the picture were found to be produced in almost actual size without exaggeration. Thus, the measured height of the trees turned out to be appropriate as baseline data for reproduction of the vegetation landscape.Third, through the Rubber Sheeting Transformation of <Donggwoldo>, it was possible to make a ground plan for the planting of <Donggwoldo> on the current digital topographic map. In particular, as the transformed area of <Donggwoldo> was departmentalized and control points were added, the precision of transformation improved. It was possible to grasp the changed position of planting as well as the change in planting density through a ground plan of planting of <Donggwoldo>.Lastly, it was possible to produce a three-dimensional vegetation landscape model by using the information of the shape of the trees and the ground plan for the planting of <Donggwoldo>. Based on the three-dimensional model, it was easy to examine the characteristics of the three-dimensional view of the current vegetation via the view axis, skyline, and openness to and cover from the adjacent regions at the level of the eyes.This study is differentiated from others in that it verified the realism of <Donggwoldo> and suggested the possibility of ascertaining the original form of the vegetation landscape described in the painting."

By introducing an analytical model of regional governance, this study tries to compare the quantitative as well as quantitative development of the regional governance and regional organizations in the eight regions of the world. In particular, this study uses the data collected by the Union of International Associations since 1982. Following characteristics were identified as results of the analysis: 1) the historical growth of regional IGOs and NGOs could be divided into three stages. That is, their number grew up rapidly between 1982 and 1995 and their growth rate slowed down around 2006. Since then, the growth rate of IGOs and NGOs repeated ups and downs. 2) the main form of Northeast Asian regional governance has transformed from the inter-state federal model (Type I) to the pluralistic order model (Type II) between 1982 to 1996. It has gradually transformed into the Type I again since 2006. These results raise the questions to the existing discourse that roughly understands that the regional governance has emerged around 2000 in this region. Furthermore, they imply that the state-centrality is also an important issue in the recent regional governance, along with the widely recognized trends such as plurality, complexity, transnationality, and flexibility."

Therefore, an anomaly-detection model must be registered as a CQL in order to perform anomaly detection in the DSMS. This paper assumes an anomaly-detection situation in such a DSMS environment and implements the anomaly-detection model in CQL. Considering the implementation in CQL, we used an SVM (Support Vector Machine) as a class-prediction algorithm for anomaly detection. We performed experiments to improve the validation performance of the SVM. We solved the problem that validation performance of a learned model declines when the dataset is imbalanced, by applying resampling techniques.

Sita was chosen as a woman who could revive the original nature of Indian tradition since they regarded vertical gender discrimination rules as the product of later date despite the innate differences between male and female.On the other hand, Nehru opposed portraying Sita as a role model on the ground that it would consequentially hinder the elevation of the status of women. CSWI’s report showed that gender equality had not been achieved yet because of the sustenance of traditional values regarding women’s subsidiary role. Due to this, highlighting the elevation of the status of women, the critical discourses rejecting Sita was formed and the statement refusing Sita’s way of life was declared. However, with the development of Hindu fundamentalism, such arguments started to be converted into the discourses affirming Sita.Women with a strong inclination on Hindu fundamentalism reinterpreted Sita, on the basis of ‘gender differences’, as the image of a confident woman who discharges herself of women’s duty at the same time. Kishwar who took a progressive stance on gender issue began with rejecting Sita. Then, with affirming Sita while rejecting Ram, she, furthermore, changed the discourse towards the transformation Ram into a suitable husband for Sita. In such changeover, both recognitions of ‘gender discrimination’ and ‘gender role difference’ exist side by side.However, all discourses supporting/opposing/reinterpreting Sita still lies within the recognition which insists to make the sole role model for women. From the above, I am convinced that without departing from the recognition requiring a standardized role-model for women, the elimination of gender discrimination and the independent growth of women will be difficult to grasp."
Robust face recognition via hierarchical collaborative representation,2018,"['Face recognition', 'Hierarchical collaborative representation-based classification', 'Local ternary patterns', 'Convolutional neural network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Collaborative representation-based classification (CRC) is currently attracting the attention of researchers because it is more effective than conventional representation-based classifiers in recognition tasks. CRC has shown high face recognition accuracy; however, its accuracy is degraded significantly if the number of training faces in each class is small. This is because the accuracy of CRC is only dependent on the results of minimizing the Euclidean distance between a testing face and its approximator in the collaborative subspace of training faces. In this research, we proved that the accuracy of CRC can be improved substantially by minimizing not only the Euclidean distance between a testing face and its approximator but also the Euclidean distances from the approximator to training faces in each class. Consequently, we presented a hierarchical collaborative representation-based classification (HCRC) in which a two-stage classifier is applied for training faces, and the recognition accuracy of the second-stage classifier is significantly improved in comparison to that of the first-stage classifier. Moreover, the recognition rate of our classifier can be considerably increased by using models of discriminative feature extraction. Since noise and illumination are the main factors that cause CRC to be less accurate, we propose combining HCRC with a wide model of local ternary patterns (LTP). This combination enhances the efficiency of face recognition under different illumination and noisy conditions. For dealing with face recognition under variations in pose, expression and illumination, we present a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model of discriminative feature learning, which transforms face images into a common set of distinct features. The combination of HCRC with this deep model achieves high recognition rates on challenging face databases. Furthermore both models are optimized to reduce computational costs so that they can be successfully applied for real-world applications of face recognition that are required to run reliably in real time. In addition, we also prove that combining state-of-the-art DCNN models with HCRC results in an significant improvement in face recognition performance. We demonstrate several experiments with challenging face recognition datasets. Our results show that the hierarchical collaborative representation-based classifier with the models significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</P>"

The Party Congress also acted as a repository for the topic and exercise its influence in North Korean poetry. In this paper, we looked at how the keywords representing the period, such as the Mallima Era, the Mallima Speed, and the Mallima Rider, are represented in North Korean poetry. It was Mallima that North Korea, which is eager for high-tech science and technology and knowledge economy to rise to world-class level, symbolized the discourse of the times through the party conference. The meaning of Mallima is not in speed, but in the spirit of being able to overcome external containment and pressure. If Chollima is the speed of production, Mallima is the force of self-power. Mallima's sense of speed is a sense of strength that the rocket emblemizes. Mallima aims at globalization through science and technology and has a desire that is not the same as the previous speed discourse. At this time, an important task facing North Korean literature was to create the typical form of Mallima. The Mallima Rider is the leader of the self-power and needs something new to succeed in becoming a model for the spirit of the times. However, it was difficult to create a typical Mallima rider. In North Korea, the labor hero is a model for the popular movement and must be learned by the masses. But Mallima rider was hard to become a model to learn like this. In this process, instead of the typical model, the group, the workplace, the production site, and the product were transformed into the representational category representing the Mallima era. Mallima did not create a typical working hero as a individual labor hero, but it became the force of collective movement. Such a phenomenon is deviating from the typical type that has been generally discussed in North Korean literature and arts."
HEC-HMS을 이용한 안성천 유역의 강우 유출 특성 분석,2018,"['Clark’s UH', 'HEC-HMS', 'Muskingum', 'Optimization technique', 'SCS-CN']","과거 홍수로 인한 침수피해가 자주 발생하였던 안성천 하류 저지대의 홍수-유출 특성을 파악하기 위해서 HEC-HMS 모형을 적용하였다. 모형은 SCS-CN 방법으로 손실계산을, Clark의 단위도법으로 강우의 직접유출 변환을, 지수함수적 감소 방법으로 기저유량을, Musingum 방벙으로 하도추적을 하는 과정을 포함한다. 모형에서 매개변수는 중요한 역할을 하므로, 최적화 기법을 시행착오법과 병행하여 최적화 변수를 도출하였다. 또한, 민감도 분석을 통하여 도달시간, 저류함수, 기저유량 관련 상수들이 모형에 미치는 영향을 파악하였다. 도달시간은 첨두유량 발생 시각에 영향을, 저류상수는 첨두 유량의 증감에 영향을 기저유량 감소비는 수문곡선 하강부의 기울기에 영향을 미치는 것으로 나타났다. 최적화 과정을 통하여 모형 보정을 거친 변수를 사용하여 2건의 강우 사상에 대하여 유출모의를 수행하여 실측 자료와 비교를 하였으며, 유출체적, 첨두유량, 첨두시각을 포함한 중요 수문현상에 대하여 상당히 정확하게 모사하는 것으로 나타났다. 따라서, 본 연구의 결과는 정책입안자가 홍수관리대책을 수립하는 데 유용한 도구로서 사용되어 질 수 있을 것으로 사료된다.","The HEC-HMS model was applied to identify the rainfall-runoff processes for the Anseongchun basin, where the lower part of the stream has been damaged severely by tropical storms in the past. Modeling processes include incorporating with the SCS-CN model for loss, Clark’s UH model for transformation, exponential recession model for baseflow, and Muskingum model for channel routing. The parameters were calibrated through an optimization technique using a trial and error method. Sensitivity analysis after calibration was performed to understand the effects of parameters, such as the time of concentration, storage coefficient, and base flow related constants. Two storm water events were simulated by the model and compared with the corresponding observations. Good accuracy in predicting the runoff volume, peak flow, and the time to peak flow was achieved using the selected methods. The results of this study can be used as a useful tool for decision makers to determine a master plan for regional flood control management."
학교 미술교육과 지역연계: 현황과 활성화 방안을 중심으로,2018,"['지역연계', '교육과정 재구성', 'school-community connection in art education', 'curriculum reconstruction']","본 연구는 초ㆍ중학교의 정규 교육과정을 중심으로 학교　미술 교육의 지역 연계 활성화 방안을 탐색하는 연구로서, 문헌조사와 면담조사 및 전문가 협의회를 통하여 학교 미술교육 관련 지역연계의 현황을 파악하여 학교 미술 교육 지역연계 활성화 방안을 제시하는 것을 목적으로 한다. 지금까지 지역연계는 마을 공동체와 학교의 방과후 학교를 중심으로 이루어 져왔기에, 학교 정규 교육과정안에서 실행되고 있는 지역연계에 대한 연구는 거의 이루어지지 않았다. 따라서 본 연구는 실질적으로 정규교육과정 안에서 미술과 관련된 지역연계를 실행하고 있는 초 중학교의 교사와 해당 지역 교육지원청의 지역연계 담당 장학사를 연구참여자로 선정하여 심층면담을 실시하여 학교미술교육 관련 지역연계의 실태와 어려움을 파악하였다. 연구 결과, 지역연계의 시작은 시스템보다는 개인적 영역에서 이루어져왔고, 대부분의 초등고사, 중등 미술 교사들은 교육과정 재구성을 통하여 해당 교과내용과 지역을 연계하고 있었고, 지원받는 예산의 형태 또한 다양하였다. 교육청과 교육지원청으로 부터의 지원은 공문, 마을 자원지도 및 책자를 통한 정보 연계, 지자체에서 운영하는 버스이용을 통한 물적 연계, 예술 강사의 지원을 통하여 이루어지는 인적 연계로 나타났다. 이를 기반으로 활성화 방안을 제시하였는데, 첫째, 지역별 특성을 고려한 예술 교육 협력 체제 개발을 위해 두 가지 모델인 기초 지방자치단체 중심 협력 모델과 교육지원청ㆍ문화재단 중심 협력 모델을 제안하였고, 둘째, 효과적인 지역예술교육협의체 구성 및 운영안을 제시, 셋째, 학생 참여 모델 및 학생 주도 모델로 운영되는 지역축제 운영안을 제시하였다.","The purpose of this study was to explore how to integrate school art curriculum into communities at the levels of elementary schools and middle schools, in order to build strong connection between schools and communities. So far, school-community connection was done through extra curriculum of the schools and community schools, not the regular class at schools. It means that not most students but a few selected students can be involved with this type of learning. In this context, this study focused the experience of teachers and school inspectors as research participants, who have executed the school-community connection integrating art curriculum into community resources and needs, incorporating in-depth interview as qualitative research method.As a result, research on the actual condition was reported as followings. First, the school-community connection in art was initiated in personal interests and dedication of individual teachers. Second, curriculum reconstruction with art and community resources was the core of this activity. Third, the budget was provided all different kinds of sources. Forth, the Education Ministry supports information, community resource booklets and maps, and human resources. In addition, five difficulties as safety issues, nominal support from the Eduction Ministry, the absence of big plan in relation to the school-community connection, the absence of supporting system, consequently overworking of the teachers, and less funding opportunity of art curriculum-transforming.Therefore, based on the analysis of the actional condition and difficulties, ways to build strong connection between art curriculum at school in regular classes and community resource were suggested as three following ways: applying a self-governing body-led collaboration model and Education Ministry-cultural foundation collaboration model, forming a consultative group, and curating students-led community festivals."

SWOT 분석1) 강점(strengths)■ 수익성은 저금리에 따른 부실여신 축소와 가계금융의 확대 등 대출자산의 안정적인 증가와 이자마진의 부분적인 개선, 비용효율화 노력 등으로 회복하고 있는 것으로 평가■ 자본적정성의 경우 일부 특수은행을 제외하면 당기순이익의 확대와 안정적인 배당정책, 자본규제의 강화 추세에 따라 양호한 수준을 시현하는 등 완충력이 전반적으로 개선■ 은행을 중심으로 한 대형화와 그룹화를 달성함으로써 은행의 업무기반을 활용한 사업다각화 기반 및 해외사업 확대 등에 유리한 경영구조로 전환2) 약점(weaknesses)■ 그동안 방카슈랑스 및 펀드 판매 등을 통해 비이자이익 수익을 다변화를 모색해 왔으나 가계대출 및 부동산 관련 대출의 높은 성장세로 이자수익 의존도가 높아짐에 따라 이익다변화가 절실■ 주택금융 및 중소기업금융에 있어서 공공부문의 보증지원으로 은행권의 안정성은 제고된 반면 은행권의 적극적인 위험인수 또는 중개기능은 위축■ 장기간에 걸친 가계대출 중심의 자산성장은 가계자산의 부동산에 대한 편중위험을 높이는 한편 기업금융 수요변화에 대한 중장기 대응력을 약화시킴으로써 중개기능의 불균형을 초래■ 대기업 여신의 경우 특수은행이나 정책금융기관을 통해 확대되면서 일반은행의 역할이 축소되는 한편 전체 은행권의 대기업부문에 대한 적극적인 감시역할이 이전에 비해 위축■ 인터넷전문은행의 허용으로 경쟁이 촉진되고 있으나, 주택금융 및 중소기업 금융을 중심으로 한 대형은행 위주의 시장구조로 인해 다양성 및 특화기반이 타 금융권에 비해 취약3) 기회(opportunities)■ 고령화에 따른 은퇴자금의 마련 등 금융자산 축적 유인이 확대되고 가계부채에 대한 규제 강화로 금융자산에 대한 수요가 확대되면서 자산관리 및 은퇴서비스 등의 서비스혁신이 지속될 전망■ 아시아 경제의 비중 확대, 기업의 시장기반 확대, 정치경제적 협력관계 개선 등은 은행산업의 국제화 추세를 강화하고 장기적 관점의 전략적 유인도 커질 전망· 아시아 지역 등 향후 국제화 모델은 실물경제와 맞물려 지역적 연계성, 장기성장의 가능성, 위험흡수 및 지역위험의 관리 등에서 선진시장에 비해 위험 대비 이익이 커질 여지** 신흥시장의 매력도는 단기적 위험이나 글로벌 금융여건 변화에 따른 불확실성으로 약화될 수도 있음을 감안할 때 장기적, 전략적, 종합적, 단계적 접근에 의한 위험관리 필요성은 상존■ 글로벌 금융위기 이후 외화유동성 관리 강화와 단기외채의 축소, 해외투자의 확대 등에 따른 대외건전성 제고로 국내 은행산업에 대한 글로벌 브랜드 및 신인도는 상당 수준 개선4) 위협(threats)(환경적 측면)■ 금리인상 기조 전환은 2008년 이후 지속된 저금리 환경 하에서 확대되어 온 가계부채 또는 기업부채의 금리위험을 높임으로써 동태적 건전성 관리의 잠재위험 요인에 해당■ 디지털 기술혁신에 따른 고객접점의 변화는 오프라인 점포와 대면형태의 기존 비즈니스 모델의 취약성을 높이고 신 금융기술을 활용한 새로운 player에 의한 시장경쟁은 심화될 전망■ 부동산 담보중심의 자산구조는 부동산 가격의 변동성 확대 시 은행전체의 시스템 위험을 높일 수 있다는 점에서 은행권의 자발적, 선제적 완충력 확충이 긴요· 국내 부동산 가격의 경우 역사적으로 변동성이 낮았음을 감안하여 예상치 못한 장기 경기변동 위험 혹은 꼬리위험을 감안하여 완충력의 누적적(cumulative) 확충도 고려** 누적적 완충력 확보는 꼬리위험의 개연성이 낮다는 점에서 일정 기간 동안 특별준비금 등을 적립하고 시장여건이 개선되는 경우 이를 이익 환입하는 형태로 가능(제도적 측면)■ 글로벌 금융위기 이후 은행권을 중심으로 금융권의 과다한 이익창출에 대한 회의론 등으로 금융산업 규제 강화 기조에도 불구 향후 대내외 경제여건을 감안한 적정규제 방향을 모색할 필요■ 국내 금융소비자의 부정적인 인식 외에도 정책적으로 확대되고 있는 소비자권리 강화로 은행권의 고객서비스 형태나 평가, 소비자권익보호를 위한 내부통제 등 경영문화의 개선이 요구될 전망■ 사회적으로 은행을 중심으로 한 금융서비스의 공공성 제고에 대한 기대감과 정책적 관심이 확대되고 있어 공공성을 감안한 경영기조의 균형 확보도 긴요2. 종합평가■ 국내 은행산업은 은행서비스의 차별성 및 위상을 통해 대내적 성장을 유지해 왔으며, 또한 시장경쟁 촉진 및 책임 강화 등 새로운 역할요구에 대응할 수 있는 재무적 기반이 개선되고 있는 것으로 평가되며(strength), 반면 중개기능의 다양화 및 대외적 역할 제고, 서비스 혁신 등을 통해 대국민 신뢰도를 개선해 나갈 책임도 커질 것으로 예상(weakness)■ 거시금융 여건의 변화로 인한 다양한 잠재위험을 감안한 위험관리 및 자체적인 완충력을 선제적으로 확보해 나가고, 금융기술의 혁신 및 제도적 개혁에 대응한 금융소비자 중심의 내부경영 체계로의 신속하고 전반적인 전환이 이루어질 필요(threat)■ 장기적으로 금융자산 및 역외금융을 통한 신성장 기반 추구를 위해서는 신뢰할 수 있는 경영역량과 재무성과, 위험관리 체계를 마련하여야 대외적 위험을 차단하고 국내 은행시스템의 안정성을 유지할 수 있을 것으로 판단(opportunity)Ⅳ. 차별성 및 사회적 역할을 고려한 전략과제와 발전방향■ 거시금융 및 시장, 기술, 제도 변화에 대응한 은행의 차별화된 사회적 역할은 시스템 안정성을 근간으로 사회적 요구를 분담해 나갈 수 있는 역량과 여건을 형성함으로써 촉진1. 차별성 및 사회적 역할을 고려한 전략과제1) 지속성장을 위한 이익창출 여건의 유지■대외적 환경의 패러다임 변화와 기술혁신, 은행시장의 다양화에 따른 경쟁구도 개편, 해외시장 진출의 장기적 유효성 등을 감안하여 안정성과 수익기반을 대내시장에서 확보2) 사회경제적 중개기능 확충과 서비스 다양화 기반의 마련■국내은행은 기업금융을 중심으로 한 정책수요 확대와 채권기관으로서의 역할 제고 외에 사회경제적 중개기능의 활성화를 감안하여 은행권 차원의 장기적 역할모델을 구축· 기업금융을 중심으로 한 은행의 중개기능 강화에 대한 정책적, 사회적, 제도적 요구에 대응하여 은행의 실물경제에 대한 기여도를 높이기 위한 정책적 기조가 지속될 필요** 은행서비스의 다양화 또는 은행서비스의 기술기반 확충, 기업금융 및 투자금융 관련 규제적 차원의 우호적 여건을 고려·사회경제적 금융수요에 대한 정책에 대응하기 위해서는 장기적으로는 개별 은행의 자체 위험관리 역량 확보가 필요하며, 단기적으로는 전체은행권 차원의 역할분담을 강화할 필요■ 국내 은행서비스의 범위 확대와 은행 간 차별화를 촉진할 수 있도록 서비스기반의 전문화 또는 특화에 따른 경쟁을 촉진할 수 있는 규율체계로의 점진적인 전환도 고려3) 아시안 네트워크 등 역외성장과 대외협력 강화■ 아시아 경제의 확대 또는 기존 국제화 기반을 연계하여 협력 중심의 네트워크 구축을 통해 해당 지역의 실물경제 성장에 따른 해외수익을 제고함으로써 국내 수익과의 균형을 개선· 신흥시장의 성장 가속화, 기존 해외영업망의 활용, 국내은행의 서비스강점 등을 감안하여 해외시장에서의 협력체계 또는 네트워크 구축 등을 대안으로 고려** 아시안 시장에 대한 중장기 로드맵 마련 등을 통해 개별 은행 중심의 해외진출 전략뿐만 아니라 아시아 지역에 대한 전체 은행산업의 역할 및 구도, 은행 간 협력, 민관협력 등에 대한 장기 전략을 마련* 한편 아시아 등 신흥국 경제여건은 거시금융여건의 변화와 맞물려 단기적으로 변동성이 확대되거나 금융시스템의 불안정성이 나타날 수 있음을 감안하여 이해관계자로서의 전략적 접근으로 장기효과창출에 주력4) 금융기술 혁신을 통한 소비자 중심의 디지털 서비스 체계 구축■ 금융기술의 확산 및 발전에 따른 기존 서비스 모델의 재구축 등을 포함한 디지털 전략을 금융소비자 중심의 규제체계 및 대국민 신뢰도회복, 국제화의 경쟁력 확보 수단으로 활용· 새로운 서비스모델 구축은 소비자 중심의 금융패러다임 구축과 해외진출의 인프라로 확장시킴으로써 국내 은행산업의 서비스 혁신 및 변환(upgrade & transformation) 전략으로도 활용* 소비자 중심의 패러다임은 맞춤형 서비스, 관계금융의 강화, 고객이익의 보장, 고객의 공정한 대우, 고객만족도의 반영 등 고객중심의 경영기조에 해당2. 향후 비전, 성장경로와 경영목표1) 비전(vision) 측면■ 우리나라 은행산업의 미래는 새로운 시장적, 정책적, 기술적 여건에 대응하고 지역적 확장을 도모함으로써 ① 이익기반의 다변화, ② 신뢰도의 제고, ③ 서비스 혁신으로 국내시장의 안정화와 아시아 등 역외 금융시장의 주도적인(leading) 참여자로서의 위상을 높이는 과정이 될 전망■ 국내 은행산업은 해외시장의 수익기여도 제고, 사회적 책임 및 공공성 제고, 기술혁신에 의한 소비자 신뢰도 제고, 안정성과 수익성의 조화 등을 통해 미래 성장기반을 마련2) 향후 경영목표와 고려사항■ 국내은행은 차별성 제고와 사회적 역할 강화에 따른 중장기 경영목표 설정과 관련하여 다음과 같은 지표를 감안· [중기 경영안정성 평가] 신상품 및 신설 규제 등이 중기 ROE 또는 자기자본비율 등 수익성 및 완충력 지표에 미치는 영향평가를 통해 경영안정화 기조를 확보· [글로벌 대응력의 평가] 해외수익 또는 해외자산 비중 등을 감안하고 이에 대한 리스크를 감안한 글로벌(globalized) 건전성 지표를 활용함으로써 글로벌 경영기조를 정착·

With the inclusion of GCED as part of global education agenda through the UN SDG 4.7, its role and importance has been highlighted globally and many countries started to reflect GCED into their national curriculum. However, there is lack of practical research on the appropriate teaching and learning model of GCED that can be applied in primary and secondary school education. Therefore, this study, through theoretical review, analyzed and identified that cooperative learning is moreappropriate in fostering global citizenship in comparison with other teaching and learning models because of its efficient learning structure which includes positive interdependence, individual accountability, group processing, promotive interaction, interpersonal and small group social skills as its essential elements. On the basis of this, jigsaw model, among various cooperative learning models, was applied and a lesson plan on GCED based on UNESCO World Heritage, an important repository of the history of humankind and nature, was developed and presented. The proposed lesson plan would strengthen learners’ ability to shape identities, understand others, raise sense of responsibility, link knowledge and action related to issues affecting interaction and connectedness of communities at local, national and global levels in an educational setting, and thus it will be useful in actualizing the learner-centered transformative objective of GCED."

In order to achieve this goal, an extensiveliterature review, Delphi survey, focus group interview with domestic and foreign EIU experts, and field participation study were implemented. Through this study, we developed a holistic pedagogy for EIU in the 21st century. Thefollowings are the findings and conclusions of this study. First, the aim of EIU in the 21st century is ‘to cultivate glocal citizenship’. Today, globalization is being achieved through interactions on various levels; that is, between world and local, between regions, countries, individuals, and civil societies. Because of this periodical change, EIU in the holistic model employs both global and local (glocal) perspectives in its aim. Second, EIU ultimately aims at cultivating ‘citizens’ who can embrace various cultures of the world, acknowledge diversity, try to coexist with the natural environment through recognizing a mutual relationship. Holistic education and UNESCO  s four learning pillars are used for a new practice of EIU. Third, specific educational objectives and contents are presented for the holistic pedagogy of EIU. The educational objectives are set in four areas: knowledge, skill, attitude/value, and action. And the contents of education are developed to include three topics: glocal provision, glocal conscientization, global issues. In addition, a new learning model is presented connecting the three main contents with four learning pillars, and this learning model is designed to have flexibility and openness depending regional situation, time situation and learner s situation. Fourth, as for the teaching approach to cultivate glocal citizenship, critical thinking, active participation/ inclusion, cooperative attitude, transformational approaches are suggested. It is expected that the development of a holistic model for EIU based on the re-conceptualization of EIU in the 21st century will contribute to the development of a more innovative approach for international exchange, global solidarity, global supporting activities, and EIU training programs as well as for formal and non-formal school curriculum for EIU."
"EMOTION, COMPENSATION AND CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT: EVIDENCE FROM LUXURY HOTELS IN CHINA",2018,"['service failure', 'emotion', 'immediate and delayed compensation', 'customer engagement', 'brand loyalty', 'luxury hotels']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Introduction Although hotel employees are trained to deliver the best service, service failures may happen at any time because service is delivered by people to people (Susskind, 2002). Moreover, customers are more impressed by failed services than good services (Titz, 2001). According to the recovery paradox, customers have higher satisfaction level after experiencing a service failure if they receive satisfactory service recovery or compensation (McCollough & Bharadwaj, 1992). With the development of information communication technology and mobile device, customers can receive personalized services in recent days (Migacz, Zou, & Petrick, 2018). They also can easily share their experience on the online review platforms such as TripAdvisor, as well as select hotels based on shared online reviews (Liu & Park, 2015; Nieto-Gara?a, Mu?oz-Gallego, & Gonz?lez-Benito, 2017). Therefore, it is important for hotel managers to understand the mechanisms for service failure and recovery strategy. Thus, this study aims to examine the relationship between different emotion, customer engagement and brand loyalty under the context from the luxury hotels in China that different service failure compensation strategies are adopted. Particularly, the following two research questions are aimed to be addressed: First, do emotions (anger, regret and helplessness) significantly affect hotel brand loyalty through customer engagement? Second, does compensation type (immediate vs. delayed) significantly affect customer engagement and hotel brand loyalty based on customers’ emotions? The results of this study will benefit industry practitioners for formulating effective service failure recovery strategies. Theoretical frameworks and hypotheses development Stimulus-Organism-Response framework Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework is a commonly used form of behavioral research in which events or occurrences are said to be the result of certain stimulus leading to a certain response, following a set of organism processes (Kim & Lennon, 2013; Mehrabian & Russell, 1974). In behavioral research, the S-O-R theory explains “how” something happens and a variance theory describes “why” (Chiles, 2003). We adopted the S-O-R framework in an attempt to explain the effect of the compensation types (immediate vs. delayed) on hotel brand loyalty. In our research model, customer engagement is used an intervening construct on the causal relationship between emotions of customer (anger and regret as a retrospective emotions, helplessness as a prospective emotion) (Gelbrich, 2010) and hotel brand loyalty. Customer engagement is composed of multidimensional concepts of identification, enthusiasm, attention, absorption, and interaction (So, King, & Spark, 2014). Our model thus explains four basic processes of relationship impact on service failure as “stimulus”, emotions and customer engagement as “organism”, and hotel brand loyalty as “response”. This study also emphasizes compensation type as “moderator”. The model shows how to enhance the understanding of emotions that affect hotel brand loyalty through customer engagement based on the moderating effect of compensations type. Customer engagement It is important for a firm to manage customers to improve a firm’s performance. Customer management has transformed from customer transactions, to relationship marketing, and then engaging customers (Pansari and Kumar 2017). There are different definition about customer engagement and most of them define customer engagement as the activity of the customer toward the firm. For example, Pansari and Kumar (2017) define customer engagement as how customer contributes to the firm by “the mechanics of a customer’s value addition to the firm, either through direct or/and indirect contribution.” Vivek et al. (2012) define customer engagement as “the intensity of an individual’s offerings or organizational activities, which either the customer or the organization initiates” (p.127). It has been discussed that customer engagement has been affected by customer emotion and also has significant impact on behaviour intention and brand loyalty. However it has not been discussed under service failure context and when different types of compensation strategies are employed. This study therefore aims to explore this mechanics. Under hospitality context, So, King and Sparks (2014) develop five factors to measure customer engagement: identification, enthusiasm, attention, absorption, and interaction. Since this study also examine hotel guest customers, we adopt the scale of So et al. (2014) due to its comprehensiveness and consistent context. Service failure and emotion Customer emotion is an important antecedent of customer engagement. Currently firms have been shifted their focus from selling products to emotional connection with their customers (Pansari and Kumar 2017). Positive emotion may enhance customer engagement and thereby improve customer loyalty. But when service failure occurs, customers have different negative emotions including anger, frustration, helplessness, regret amongst others. These negative emotions of customers disappoint customers themselves and reduce customer loyalty. Different emotions may have different impact on customer engagement. Anger often refers to the attributes of others such as the service providers (Weiner, 1985) whereas regret often refers to the service failure locus of customer himself/herself such as the customer is regret to choose this service provider (Roseman, 1991). Both anger and regret refer to retrospective emotions and when customer would like to solve questions they may also negative emotion of helplessness which is called prospective emotions (Davidow, 2003; Gelbrich, 2010). This study aims to examine and differentiate the impact of two retrospective emotions of anger and regret and one prospective emotions of helplessness. The first hypothesis is therefore proposed: H1: Anger has negative impact on customer engagement. H2: Regret has negative impact on customer engagement. H3: Helplessness has negative impact on customer engagement. Service failure compensation Though service providers aim to deliver zero fault service, it is inevitable service failure may occur that may bring customers anger and dissatisfaction and damage the customer loyalty thereby. It is found that compensation is an effective way to comfort and delight the dissatisfied customers. Therefore, it is important to formulate effective compensation strategy when service failure occurs. Different compensation strategies such as monetary or nonmonetary (Fu et al. 2015), immediate or delayed compensation (Boshoff, 1997; Davidow, 2003), may be suitable to different contexts/situations. According to prospect theory, a customer is risk-reverse in case of gains. A customer may value products available now more than products obtained in the future due to the higher certainty of the former. Similarly, immediate compensation has less uncertainty than delayed compensation, and therefore is supposed to have higher value. Therefore customers with anger are assumed to have higher customer engagement when immediately compensated. On the other hand, regret customers attribute failure to himself/herself and therefore less expect compensation. The immediate compensation may lead to unfair and thereby less effect than delayed compensation. Therefore immediate compensation may not always be superior over the delayed one under different contexts. We therefore propose the second hypothesis: H1a: Compensation type (immediate vs. delayed) moderates the relationship between anger and customer engagement. H2a: Compensation type (immediate vs. delayed) moderates the relationship between regret and customer engagement. H3a: Compensation type (immediate vs. delayed) moderates the relationship between helplessness and customer engagement. Brand loyalty Brand loyalty refers to the loyalty of a customer toward the brand both behaviourally and attitudinally (Dick and Basu 1994; Li and Petrick 2008; So, King, Sparks, and Wang 2013). It is a key goal of marketing activities, and its antecedents have been extensively examined such as satisfaction, perceived quality, received value, and brand trust, amongst others. Customer engagement, as the activity of a customer toward to a firm, is naturally viewed to influence brand loyalty. This study therefore adopts brand loyalty as the consequence of customer engagement. Furthermore, we would like to examine if compensation types have moderating effect between customer engagement and brand loyalty. We therefore propose below two hypotheses: H4: customer engagement has positive impact on brand loyalty. H4a: Compensation type (immediate vs. delayed) moderates the relationship between customer engagement and brand loyalty. The research model is shown in Figure 1 where all hypotheses are demonstrated. Our research model is developed based on the S-O-R framework in which emotions are antecedent of customer engagement, and customer engagement impacts hotel brand loyalty. This research model also shows the moderating effects of compensation types has on causal relationships between the aforementioned constructs. Methodology Scenario design Scenario based questionnaire is designed to obtain quantitative data for analysis. Based on the interview with hotel managers/operators, one service failure scenario and two compensation scenarios (immediate and delayed) are designed. In-depth interviews with a couple of hotel managers and guests were conducted to verify the realisation of the scenarios formulated. The questionnaire begins with a screening question: in the previous 12 months have you ever had experience staying in a four- or five-star hotel? The survey would only continue if the answer is “yes”. Then the participant is asked to write down the name of this hotel and read the below service failure scenario thereby. Service failure scenario: Imagine you have checked into this hotel again. During your stay in hotel, you send your coat for laundry. It is a nice coat and you bought it a year ago with the price of 1000RMB. However when you collect the cleaned coat, you notice that there is a damage on your coat which makes you cannot dress this coat anymore. You therefore call the service counter for complain. Immediate and delayed compensation scenarios were designed as follows: Immediate compensation scenario: after 15 minutes, the duty manager of the hotel went to our hotel and expressed his sincere apology. You showed him about the damage and informed him the original price of your coat. The manager offered you the cash compensation with the original price of your coat and you agree with this. After half an hour you received 1000RMB cash as the compensation. Delayed compensation scenario: after 15 minutes, the duty manager of the hotel went to your room and expressed his sincere apology. You showed him about the damage and informed him the original price of your coat. The manager said according to the hotel policy, they need to check how this happened and confirm the price of your coat first before making the compensation for you. After two weeks you left the hotel, you received 1000RMB compensation which is transferred into your bank account directly. Participant emotion is measured after the participants read the service failure scenario and before they read the compensation scenario. Each participant is randomly assigned to be involved in one compensation scenario only. Customer engagement and hotel brand loyalty are measured after the compensation happened. Variable measurement Customer engagement is measured using 25-item scale developed by So et al. (2014) in which five factors are involved: identification, enthusiasm, attention, absorption, and interaction. Particularly, identification is measured by four attributes: “When someone criticizes this brand, it feels like a personal insult”, “When I talk about this brand, I usually say we rather than they”. “This brand’s successes are my successes”. “When someone praises this brand, it feels like a personal compliment”. Enthusiasm is measured by five attributes: “I am heavily into this brand”. “I am passionate about this brand” “I am enthusiastic about this brand” “I feel excited about this brand” “I love this brand”. Attention is measured by five attributes: “I like to learn more about this brand” “I pay a lot of attention to anything about this brand” “Anything related to this brand grabs my attention” “I concentrate a lot on this brand” “I like learning more about this brand” . Absorption is measured by five attributes: “When I am interacting with the brand, I forget everything else around me” “Time flies when I am interacting with the brand” “When I am interacting with brand, I get carried away” “When interacting with the brand, it is difficult to detach myself” “In my interaction with the brand, I am immersed” “When interacting with the brand intensely, I feel happy”. Interaction is measure by five attributes: “In general, I like to get involved in brand community discussions” “I am someone who enjoys interacting with likeminded others in the brand community” “I am someone who likes actively participating in brand community discussions” “In general, I thoroughly enjoy exchanging ideas with other people in the brand community” “I often participate in activities of the brand community”. Three emotion of anger, regret and helplessness are included as the measurement of emotion. Particularly, according to Gelbrich (2010), three attributes are adopted to measure anger “I would feel angry with the hotel/hotel employees”, “I would feel mad with the hotel/hotel employees”, and “I would feel furious about the hotel/hotel employees”. Three statements are employed to measure regret (Tsiros & Mittal 2000): “I would feel sorry for choosing this hotel”, “I regretted choosing this hotel”, and “I should have chosen another hotel”. Four statements are used to measure helplessness (Gelbrich 2010): “I would feel helpless”, “I would feel lost”, “I would feel defenceless”, and “I would feel stranded.” Five statements are used to measure brand loyalty (So, King, Sparks, & Wang 2013): “I would say positive things about this brand to other people.” “I would recommend this brand to someone who seeks my advice.” “I would encourage friends and relatives to do business with this brand.” “I would consider this brand my first choice to buy services.” “I would do more business with this brand in the next few years.” A seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (=disagree strongly) to 7 (=agree strongly) is adopted for all measurement. Data collection and analysis method In-depth interview with managers from upscale hotels and customers will be used to finalize scenarios. Opinions of academic experts will be used to revise variable measurements and questionnaires. Convenience sampling method will be adopted to obtain about 400 respondents who has experience of staying at four- or five-stars hotels in China in the previous year. Regarding with data analysis, Partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is used to test the hypotheses proposed. Expected results The manipulation check has been conducted to verify the scenarios designed. The negative relationship between emotions and customer engagement are expected and compensation timing (delayed or immediate) may moderate this relationship. Most importantly, it is expected that this moderating effect varies when different emotions and customer engagement are examined. Contributions The theoretical contributions have three folders. Firstly, this study first considers compensation timing into the examination of relationship between different negative emotions and customer engagement, after service failure occurs. Secondly, this study adopts stimulus-organism-response theory to explore the mechanism how service failure could be well recovered by relationships of different negative emotions, effective compensation type, customer engagement, and brand loyalty. Thirdly, this study applies second order factor for the measurement of customer engagement and also divides negative emotions into retrospective and prospective ones to shed light on customer engagement in the context of service failure and compensation. The practical implication of this study will benefit industry practitioners for their formulation of compensation strategies. Especially as the development of big data, hotel industry is able to adopt different strategies for individuals to maximize customer experience. The findings of this study could propose different strategies for different situations/individuals thereby."

Leadership Styles and Turnover Behavior in Public Organizations : The Moderating Role of Span of Control,2018,"['transformational leadership', 'transactional leadership', 'span of control', 'turnover']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Even when leaders exhibit desirable leadership styles, the effectiveness of their behaviors on organizational outcomes may be influenced by the structural distance between them and their followers. However, previous empirical research on the relationships between leadership styles and outcomes has largely ignored the role of leader distance in public administration. Using panel data drawn from the U.S. federal government, this study explores how transformational and transactional leadership styles affect employee turnover behavior and how span of control, which is significant aspect of structural distance, moderates those relationships.The statistical results indicate that transformational leadership is negatively related to turnover behavior, whereas transactional leadership is positively related to turnover behavior. Further analysis shows that span of control significantly moderates the relationships between the two leadership styles and employee turnover behavior such that organizations benefit more from transformational leaders with a broad span of control than from those with a narrow span of control. Conversely, transactional leaders with a narrow span of control are better than those with a broad span of control at reducing turnover. The implications and contributions of these results for public administration theory and practice are discussed."

A particular focus was put on how lifelong educators interpreted the gap between theory and practice in lifelong education, and how they engaged in practice based on their interpretations. Thematic analysis from the perspective of hermeneutic phenomenology was used in the research, and eight lifelong educators working at municipal level lifelong education institutions participated in the research. The practices of lifelong educators were not a mere application of the experiential learning theory model, but an active transformation of the previously representative models of Kolb and Jarvis. Lifelong educators recognized the gap between theory and practice in the three areas of 1) theoretical orientations of lifelong education, 2) roles of lifelong educators, and 3) theoretical approaches regarding learners. Their practices to mediate the gaps in each area led to differing forms of experiential learning, respectively. How lifelong educators interpreted the gap between theory and practice was a major factor that influenced how their experiential learning unfolded. Based on such analysis, this study suggests a new concept of “interprehension” to express the totality of theory and practice in experiential learning and lifelong educators’ role to mediate the gap in between, which had not been sufficiently addressed in the experiential learning theory models of Kolb and Jarvis."

A systematic research was undertaken on theories of leadership types, job satisfaction, organizational commitment and empowerment, and then interaction between these variables was verified based on quantitative data by using Structural Equation Model (SEM). The findings suggest that making improvements of empowerment, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment demand individualized consideration and charisma, the components of transformational leadership. As a way to reduce turnover intention, the role of job satisfaction and organizational commitment was more influential than that of empowerment. Also, a combination of charisma of transformational leadership and contingent reward of transactional leadership turned out to be the ideal leadership type to reduce turnover intention. Lastly, the harmony of individual goal with that of organization, apparent documentation of reward system, and stress control were recommended as practical solutions to improve organizational profitability and effectiveness and to reduce turnover rate in dental clinics."

However, in the course of the movement, critical reflections on the limit of pastoral counseling mostly provided in the counseling room were emerged within the movement. Incorporating these critical reflections, a new slogan was suggested by Bonnie Miller-McLemore, “the study of the living human web.” This new slogan expanded the scope of the pastoral counseling movement, to the extent that it includes the care of public sphere.  While the public role of pastoral counseling became the main topic in the movement, the public role of theology also became a significant topic of many theologians in the filed of theology in general. As Don Browning and Miller-McLemore already insisted, pastoral theology as a field of doing theology through the practice of pastoral care and counseling is essentially public theology. I think pastoral theology whose main concern is to heal person and society pursues emancipatory public theology. Pastoral counseling as emancipatory public theology needs appropriate public spheres in which pastoral counselors can participate in the development and transformation of society. I suggest the social cooperative as a model for the practice of the public role of pastoral counseling. The cooperative can be a good meeting place for the cooperations with other cooperatives, private and public organizations. Furthermore, as corporate body approved by government, social cooperatives can contribute much to the development and transformation of community by participating in legislation and budgetary processes. First of all, the provision of democratic and recipient-friendly social services can be the most important contribution of the social cooperative."

The appendages are an ordinary bilge keel, a newly adopted variation involving extended platforms with ship-like hull structures, such as drillships or reversed flaps, and a stinger type. To validate the roll damping performance of newly designed appendages, a series of free-decay data for the roll motion in calm water and in regular waves are obtained from towing tank tests. The free-decay data for the roll motion is analyzed using a linear-plus-quadratic damping method as well as an alternative method based on the Hilbert transform in order to overcome the possible problem of nonlinearity for non-conventional roll stabilizers. The Hilbert transform technique has the advantage over polynomial damping models for not assuming the form of the roll characteristics. A comparison of the analysis methods for the different appendages is carried out for linear, nonlinear, and equivalent linear damping methods. The results are crosschecked in regular beam waves for different amplitudes near their resonant frequencies.

In developmental period (2015~2017), it was integrated with Ribbon of Business operated by Ministry of Health and Welfare which made Employment Success Package start as sole domestic total employment service program for low income class. It became a period that generated momentum to develop total model which links employment and welfare. Internal stabilization period (2018~ ) can be summarized as challenging period from quantitative development to qualitative leap. In this period, it is said to focus on enriching package that upgrades service contents phase by phase since a lot of limits in contents aspect from Employment Support Service have been already disclosed.The significance of this thesis is that it is not only shed light on periodical enhancement process of Employment Success Package policy but also analyzed feature in each changing process and generated synthetical implication, improvement suggestions, limits.

Pharmacotherapy should also receive priority compared with several treatment modalities including nerve blocks for chronic pain control. Therefore, pharmacology may be fundamental to anesthesia as well as pain medicine. Pharmacokinetic equations quantitatively evaluating drug transfer in the body are essential to understanding pharmacological principles. In mammillary compartmental models, pharmacokinetic equations are easily derived from a few simple principles. The kinetics of drug transfer between compartments is determined initially. Ordinary, linear differential equations are constructed based on the kinetics. The Laplace transforms of these differential equations are used to derive functions for the calculation of drug amounts in the central or effect compartments in the Laplace domain. The inverse Laplace transforms of these functions are used to obtain pharmacokinetic equations in time domain.In this review, a two-compartment mammillary pharmacokinetic model is used to derive pharmacokinetic equations using the aforementioned principles."

Finally, optimal frequency is determined since the efficiency and output voltage affected by frequency, which is validated with MATLAB simulation results."
Detecting the Oxidation of Zircaloy Claddings by Infrared Interference,2018,"['Zircaloy cladding', 'Fourier transform infrared pectroscopy', 'zirconium oxide', 'infrared interference', 'oxide layer thickness']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"As the expected life of dry cask storage installations increases, it becomes increasingly desirable to monitor the state and performance of the cask internals to ensure that they continue to safely contain the radioactive materials in the fuel. One aspect of this task is the monitoring of oxidation of the cladding. With this consideration in mind, Zircaloy-4 (Zr-4) cladding samples were exposed to air at 500℃ for various duration times to create thin corrosion oxide layers on the surface. The surfaces of the oxidized samples were then systematically scanned by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to achieve the infrared (IR) interference spectra and study the relationship between the optical interference and the various thicknesses of the oxide layers. The profiles of the oxide layers were verified througth cross-sectional examination by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The IR interference patterns varied with oxide layer thickness, enabling the determination of oxide layer thickness of values, including half micron thick. Further analysis demonstrated that the interference oscillation period and the oscillation amplitude decreased with increasing oxide layer thickness. Combined with a physical model that describes the optical interference, the interference spectra were directly correlated to the oxide layer thickness quantitatively. The study provides the basis for an accurate, nondestructive and sensitive method to monitor the degree of zirconium-based cladding corrosion due to oxidation."
Highly efficient generation of T-DNA insertion lines and isolation of flanking sequence tags (FSTs) of Brachypodium distachyon,2018,"['Brachypodium distachyon', 'Agrobacterium-mediated transformation', 'T-DNA insertion', 'Flanking sequence tag (FST)', 'Modified iPCR']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) has been developed as a model system for the temperate grasses. Hence, establishing a large insertion mutant population and identifying T-DNA insertion sites are imperative for functional genomics studies. Currently, Brachypodium has an established T-DNA collection resource, but it is far less than needed. In addition, the conventional methods for the isolation of flanking sequence tags (FSTs) characterizing the T-DNA inserts, such as TAIL-PCR, adapter ligation-mediated PCR, and inverse PCR, are time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. In this study, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system was optimized to generate T-DNA mutants. Approximately 7000 T-DNA insertion lines were obtained. Furthermore, a simple and highly efficient method was developed to isolate T-DNA flanking sequence tags (FSTs). The procedures simplified the multi-step reaction that is required for the conventional inverse PCR and several reactions were conducted within a microscale reaction system in one tube. It is flexible to isolate FSTs for either individual or large numbers of T-DNA lines. To rapidly process the large-scale sequence data, a serial of Perl scripts were developed using the Perl Programming Language (http://www.perl.org). Using these methods, a total of 794 flanking sequences were isolated and analyzed in detail. Although the methods were developed in the process of isolating and analyzing T-DNA flanking sequences of Brachypodium, it can be applied to other plants."
Transition States of Nanocrystal Thin Films during Ligand-Exchange Processes for Potential Applications in Wearable Sensors,2018,"['nanocrystals', 'ligand exchange', 'structural transformation', 'metal&#x2212']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Ligand exchange is an advanced technique for tuning the various properties of nanocrystal (NC) thin films, widely used in the NC thin-film device applications. Understanding how the NC thin films transform into functional thin-film devices upon ligand exchange is essential. Here, we investigated the process of structural transformation and accompanying property changes in the NC thin films, by monitoring the various characteristics of silver (Ag) NC thin films at each stage of the ligand-exchange process. A transition state was identified in which the ligands are partially exchanged, where the NC thin films showed unexpected electromechanical features with high gauge factors up to 300. A model system was established to explain the origin of the high gauge factors, supported by the observation of spontaneously formed nanocracks and metal-insulator transition from the structural analysis and charge transport study, respectively. Taking advantages of the unique electromechanical properties of the NC thin films, we fabricated flexible strain gauge sensor devices with high sensitivity, reliability, and stability. We introduce a one-step fabrication process, namely, “the time- and spatial-selective ligand-exchange process”, for the design of low-cost and high-performance wearable sensors that effectively detect human motion, such as finger or neck muscle movement. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the ligand-exchange process in NCs, as well as an insight into the functionalities of the NC thin films for technological applications.</P>[FIG OMISSION]</BR>"

Therefore, it is crucial to manufacture dual phase steels, complex phases steels, MS steels, TRIP steels, and TWIP from high strength steels with a tensile strength of 700Mpa or more. In order to apply ultra-high tensile strength steel to the body, the welding process is essential. Resistance spot welding, which is advantageous in terms of its cost, is used in more than 80% of cases in body welding. It is generally accepted that ultra-high tensile strength steel has poor weldability, because its alloy element content is increased to improve its strength. In the case of the resistance spot welding of ultra-high tensile steel, it has been reported that the proper welding condition area is reduced and interfacial fracture and partial interfacial fracture occur in the weld zone. Therefore, research into the welding quality judgment that can predict the defect and quality in real time is being actively conducted. In this study, the dynamic resistance of the weld was monitored using the secondary circuit process variables detected during resistance spot welding, and the factors necessary for the determination of the welding quality were extracted from the dynamic resistance pattern. The correlations between the extracted factors and the weld quality were analyzed and a regression analysis was carried out using highly correlated pendulums. Based on this research, a regression model that can be applied to the field was proposed."

The importance of supporting pre-service (and in-service) teachers through this identity development process was the impetus behind encouraging students in a pre-service teacher training program to reflect on their beliefs about teaching and their self-efficacy as teachers. A small-scale survey study was done with pre-service Korean EFL (English as a Foreign Language) teachers, where they were asked about their beliefs with respect to what a teacher is, does, etc., and then asked whether they consider themselves to be teachers, or to be ready to be a teacher. The surveys were given at the beginning and end of a semester, and students were also asked how their beliefs had changed over that period of time. The results reveal five themes in their beliefs about teachers (subject knowledge, transmission of knowledge, teaching methodology, teacher roles, and teachers as role models); generally low teacher self-efficacy at this early stage in their teacher training; and some changes in their beliefs and their knowledge base over the study period. The study reinforces the need to support PSTs as they develop their teacher identity and teacher self-efficacy."

In this paper, we study the operator which extracts patches from image and then transforms them to the vector form. Then, we find that some pixels which should be continuous in the image patches are discontinuous in the vector. Due to the poor anti-noise and the loss of structure information, we propose a new operator which may keep more information when extracting image patches.

Generally, institution environments are made up of formal institutions such as laws and regulations and informal institutions such as culture. These institutions can function as the opportunity, cost or risk for the success of innovative efforts. The cross-cutting factors are devised in two dimensions: country-level and corporate-level. In country-level factors, there are three areas of regulations, economy and industry technology and four factors are suggested in each area. In corporate-level factors, leadership, environment and resources are three areas and four factors are presented in each area. Korea is scored by this model and from the scoring and analysis, some implications were presented.Overall the evaluation result of two Korean experts are shown and the findings from the analysis are summarized. First, the scores of regulation environments and corporate leadership are relatively low. In regulation environments, we measured presidential commitment, political transparency, business regulations and national security. Some obstacles still exist to deter the innovative capabilities of private companies. The corruptions between government officials and large corporations are should be eliminated. Less regulations on business operations and open environments for start-ups are prepared in Korea. Second, the score on the industry technology was analyzed to be higher than other scores. This factor was measured by ICT infra, R&D effort, support for start-ups and competitiveness of manufacturers. Except the support for start-ups, other elements are very good in Korea. Other three factors are seen to be the strength of Korean industries. Third, the scores on national economy, corporate environments and firm resources are modest. These three dimensions are in the similar status. They have been improved significantly and are expected to reach to top-level in the near future. The policy implications drawn from the analysis are about the necessity of political transparency, global competitiveness of domestic firms, performance in the investments for ICT development and proactive attitude to sustainability issues."

By analyzing official party documents and statements, this paper attempts to illuminate how the Chinese Communist Party(CCP), since the beginning of the reform and opening, has reinterpreted socialism and the mission of the party to justify its raison detre. The key has been the ideological flexibility of “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” continuously redefined and evolved under the pragmatic goal of economic development. Yet socialism in China is now going through another major transformation under Xi Jinping. This paper analyzes Xi's ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era"" and shows that socialism in China is now redefined in terms of nationalism to justify the CCP rule."
In-plane response of masonry infilled RC framed structures: A probabilistic macromodeling approach,2018,"['RC frames', 'masonry infills', 'macro-modeling approaches', 'probability transformation method', 'probability density function', 'probability-based design']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, masonry infilled reinforced concrete (RC) frames are analyzed through a probabilistic approach. A macro-modeling technique, based on an equivalent diagonal pin-jointed strut, has been resorted to for modelling the stiffening contribution of the masonry panels. Since it is quite difficult to decide which mechanical characteristics to assume for the diagonal struts in such simplified model, the strut width is here considered as a random variable, whose stochastic characterization stems from a wide set of empirical expressions proposed in the literature. The stochastic analysis of the masonry infilled RC frame is conducted via the Probabilistic Transformation Method by employing a set of space transformation laws of random vectors to determine the probability density function (PDF) of the system response in a direct manner. The knowledge of the PDF of a set of response indicators, including displacements, bending moments, shear forces, interstory drifts, opens an interesting discussion about the influence of the uncertainty of the masonry infills and the resulting implications in a design process."

GM 파파야의 개발과 더불어 생물안전성 평가 및 GM 판별 기술 개발에 관한 연구도 이루어지고 있다. 생물안전성 평가와 관련하여 주로 인체 위해성과 환경 위해성에 관한 분석이 수행되고 있다. 인체 위해성의 경우, 동물 모델을 대상으로 장기간 식이섭취를 통해 일반 및 유전 독성, 알레르기항원성, 면역 반응, GM 유래 단백질의 안정성에 관한 연구가 수행되었다. 환경 위해성의 경우, GM 재배가 토양 미생물 다양성에 미치는 영향, GM 유래 유전물질의 토양 잔류 및 토양 미생물로의 전이 여부에 관한 연구가 이루어졌다. 우리나라, 유럽 및 일본을 비롯한 많은 나라에서는 상업적 재배를 위한 GM 품종 도입이나, 파파야 가공 식품 제조에 비승인 GM 파파야의 사용을 규제하고 있다. 도입 유전자 특이적 또는 이벤트 특이적인 분자표지를 개발하고, PCR(일반, real-time) 또는 loop-mediated isothermal amplification 방법을 통해 GM 여부를 판별하고 있다. 파파야에 대한 초안 수준의 유전체 정보가 2008년에 해독되었으며, 최근에는 차세대 유전체 분석 기술로 확보된 유전체와 전사체 정보를 활용하여 GM 여부를 판별하는 기술도 확립되었다.","Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is one of the crops widely planted in tropical and subtropical areas. The papaya fruit has low calories and are plentiful in vitamins A and C and in minerals. A major problem in papaya production is a plant disease caused by the papaya ringspot virus (PRSV). The first PRSV-resistant GM papaya expressing a PRSV coat protein gene was developed by USA scientists in 1992. The first commercial GM papaya cultivars derived from the event was approved by the US government in 1997. Development of transgenic papayas has been focused on vaccine production and limited agricultural traits, including insect and pathogen resistance, long shelf life, and aluminum and herbicide tolerance. Approximately 17 countries, including the USA and China, produced transgenic papayas and/or commercialized them, which provoked studies on biosafety assessment and development of GM-detection technologies. For the biosafety assessment of potential effects on human health, effects of long-term feeding to model animals have been studied in terms of toxicity and allergenicity. Studies on environmental safety assessment include influence on soil-microbial biodiversity and transfer to soil bacteria of GM selection markers. Many countries, such as Korea, the European Union, and Japan, that have strict regulations for GM crops have serious concerns about unintended introduction of GM cultivars and food commodities using unauthorized GM crops. Transgene- and/or GM event-specific molecular markers and technologies for genomics-based detection of unauthorized GM papaya have been developed and have resulted in the robust detection of GM papayas."
Selective bit embedding scheme for robust blind color image watermarking,2018,"['Color image watermarking', 'Discrete wavelet transform', 'Quantization technique', 'Binary bit decomposition', '2D Otsu thresholding']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In this paper, we propose a novel robust blind color image watermarking method, namely SMLE, that allows to embed a gray-scale image as watermark into a host color image in the wavelet domain. After decomposing the gray-scale watermark to component binary images in digits ordering from least significant bit (LSB) to most significant bit (MSB), the retrieved binary bits are then embedded into wavelet blocks of two optimal color channels by using an efficient quantization technique, where the wavelet coefficient difference in each block is quantized to either two pre-defined thresholds for corresponding 0-bits and 1-bits. To optimize the watermark imperceptibility, we equally split the coefficient modified quantity on two middle-frequency sub-bands instead of only one as in existing approaches. The improvement of embedding rule increases approximately 3 dB of watermarked image quality. An adequate trade-off between robustness and imperceptibility is controlled by a factor representing the embedding strength. As for extraction process, we exploit 2D Otsu algorithm for higher accuracy of watermark detection than that of 1D Otsu. Experimental results prove the robustness of our SMLE watermarking model against common image processing operations along with its efficient retention of the imperceptibility of the watermark in the host image. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach outperforms in most of robustness tests at a same high payload capacity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</P>"

This study aims to examine how the adolescents of multicultural families adapt to a society by tracing the process of their identity formation. By analyzing how their identity affects their adaptation to school, we also explore whether this is relevant to how well they adapt socio-culturally. To this end, we conduct a cluster analysis, a conditional transition probability analysis, static panel model analysis and dynamic panel model analysis with data from Multicultural Adolescents Panel Study between 2011 and 2015. One of the findings is that the identity of adolescents of multicultural families can be classified into four profiles according to the interaction of national identity, attitude towards Korean culture and attitude towards foreign parents’ culture. It is also shown that identity is not fixed but is formed and changed dynamically. It indicates that the identity of adolescents of multicultural families should be investigated with a comprehensive consideration of not only national identity but also cultural identity which reflects bicultural attitudes; and that multicultural policies need to be formulated and enforced acknowledging the dynamic formation process of identity. Another finding is that how well the adolescents of multicultural families adapt to school depends on the types of identity, and that strong preference for both Korean and foreign cultures as well as strong national identity play a positive role in school adaptation. Even as the members of Korean society diversify, the different identities can coexist rather than be dissonant, suggesting that the variety in identities can lay the foundations for the expansion of social solidarity and the improvement of social integration."

The raw GPS data contained long- and short-periodic position changes and noisy signals at different frequencies. To extract the significant results from this complex dataset, the general structure and components of the GPS signal were modeled and analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Uncontrolled jumps and deviations involving the signal in the time domain were pre-filtered. Then, the signal was converted to the frequency domain after applying low- and high-pass filters, and the frequency and periodic component values were calculated. The spectrum of the tower motion obtained from the filtered GPS data had dominant peaks at a low frequency of 1.15572×10-4 Hz and a high frequency of 0.16624 Hz, consistent with two equivalent GPS datasets. Then, the signal was reconstructed using inverse Fourier transform with the dominant low frequency values to obtain filtered and interpretable clean signals. With the proposed sequence, processing of noisy data collected from the GPS receivers mounted very close to the structure is effective in revealing the basic behaviors and features of buildings."
한국과 중국의 초기 문화산업 정책과 경로의존성 문제 연구,2018,"['Cultural Industry', 'Path-dependent', 'East Asia Development Model', 'Cultural policy', 'Industrial policy']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper aims to discover what factors have affected the formation of cultural industry policies in China and Korea. And I stressed that the two countries’ cultural industry policies were formed in the frame of the ideologies and institutions of past cultural policies and strategic industry policies. In terms of cultural policy ideology, China continues to have the ideologies established by Mao Zedong, such as philosophical awareness of culture, national development and relationship with culture, the main agents of cultural policy, purpose, and means, until the 21st century. On the other hand, the successful democratization of Korea served as an opportunity to establish the independence of cultural policies from the public-driven cultural policies of past development-led dictatorships. And this transformation was shaped into an elimination of the laws and regulations for each species in the 1990s.  In terms of the cultural policy system, Korea’s shift from public information to cultural center, regulation to promotion, and extension of the cultural ministry’s external extension (integration of culture, media, tourism, and physical education) are represented. China, on the other hand, shows a characteristic of continuing without a big change in terms of its culture, administrative organization and legal system. This ideological and institutional background in cultural policy will have a strong influence on the two countries ’ development of cultural industry policies.  ‘Path-dependent’ is more noticeable in the formation of cultural industry policies, especially in relation to the two countries’ strategic industry policies. The way in which Korea promoted its cultural industry strategy was very similar to the policies for fostering heavy and chemical industries or the policies for fostering the information and communication industries. And China’s strategy for fostering the cultural industry is quite similar to its policy on fostering the information industry of the past. This shows that both Korea and China have established cultural industry policies through learning about past successful strategic industry policies. Such similar forms of Korea and China’s cultural industry policies to those of East Asian Development Model, such as the development of heavy chemical industries and the development of the information and communication industries, are seen as the absolute effects of the industry policies that these countries have had in the past."

Seed vigor is also reduced due to this degradation. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the discrimination between viable and non-viable naturally aged pepper seeds. In this study, Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy was used for spectral data acquisition in the spectral range of 4000-10000 cm<sup>-1</sup> at the interval of 4 cm<sup>-1</sup> spectral resolution with total 32 successful scans. After applying different preprocessing methods, spectral angle mapper (SAM) technique was employed as a blind source separation (BSS) tool. This technique investigated the spectral difference between a viable and non-viable seed. Afterwards, the partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was developed using multivariate data analysis. All the samples were set to a germination test to identify the viable and non-viable seed and the result was used to make calibration and validation data set. The PLS-DA model provided a good result with performance accuracy of 91% for calibration and 85% for prediction. The SAM technique and the beta coefficient derived from PLS-DA showed some spectral difference between viable and non-viable seeds that might be a reason to vary the germination ability of the seed. The results demonstrate the possibility of using the FT-NIR spectroscopic technique with chemometrics to separate seeds based on their viability, which is very important in the seed industry."

GNSS has been fast spread to various industrial application, the representative example is an application for deflection and deformation monitoring of long span bridge. The confirmation of changed displacement and stiffness should be necessary to secure the integrity and usability of bridge itself and safety of user. To do this, the accuracy of GNSS positioning solution regarded by the most fundamental data source should be converged to accuracy required. Unlike the normal geodetic surveying, GNSS observation that directly apply to bridge conducts under the convoluted environment, and also can be contaminated by various error source. Among other errors, multipath occurs the worst negative influence to GNSS positioning solution. To minimize this effect, specific error model should be employed. In the present investigation, Wavelet Transformation is apply to reduce the multipath effect induced under the bridge environment. Multipath frequency is extracted through multi‐resolution analysis(MRA) technique and is again reconstructed with free multipath. To verify algorithm introduced in this investigation, GNSS data collected from bridge in‐service has been used to conduct the verification process. In succession, two case studies have performed the bridge health monitoring system(BHMS) based on GNSS that provide more reliable and accurate positioning solution. It was able to confirm the improved results from both monitoring analysis; deflection and dynamic characteristics. Therefore, it is inevitable that the GNSS positioning solution that are more reliable and accurate can contribute on the secure safety of the bridge and users."

We especially separate the case where the Student distribution parameter (""the number degrees of freedom"") is small. We show that the Student distribution with arbitrary ""number of degrees of freedom""can be obtained as the limit when the sample size is random. We emphasize the possibility of using a family of Student distributions as a comfortable model with heavy tails since in this case many relations, in particular, a likelihood function, have the explicit form (unlike stable laws). Thus, the Laplace and Student distributions may be used as an asymptotic approximation in descriptive statistics being a convenient heavy-tailed alternative to stable laws."

In this research, we introduced spherical joint which have 3 spring stiffness about all rotational axis to define shaft. And we analyzed that how shaft bending affect drivetrain rotation, translation motion and gear mesh contact force. To do these processes, we simulated the 3-dimensional wind turbine drive train model which has bearing stiffness, gear mesh stiffness, and shaft flexibility. The gear mesh stiffness was defined by Fourier series. And the equation of motion was acquired by Lagrange equation and kinematical constraints to represent shaft flexibility. About numerical analysis, the Newmark method was used to get results. Lastly, fast Fourier transform which converts results from time domain to frequency was used."

Plasmonic gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) have been developed as contrast agents due to their strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR). This study aims to demonstrate that stimuli-responsive plasmonic Au nanoclusters (Au NCs) can be used as a contrast agent for optical coherence tomography (OCT) in detecting early-stage cancer. Au NPs were clustered via acid-cleavable linkers to synthesize Au NCs that disassemble under mildly acidic conditions into individual Au NPs, simultaneously diminishing SPR effect (quantified by scattering intensity) and increasing Brownian motion (quantified by Doppler variance). The acid-triggered morphological and accompanying optico-physical property changes of the acid-disassembling Au NCs were confirmed by TEM, DLS, UV/Vis, and OCT. Stimuli-responsive Au NCs were applied in a hamster check pouch model carrying early-stage squamous carcinoma tissue. The tissue was visualized by OCT imaging, which showed reduced scattering intensity and increased Doppler variance in the dysplastic tissue. This study demonstrates the promise of diagnosing early-stage cancer using molecularly programmable, inorganic nanomaterial-based contrast agents that are capable of generating multiple, stimuli-triggered diagnostic signals in early-stage cancer."

The papaya fruit has low calories and are plentiful in vitamins A and C and in minerals. A major problem in papaya production is a plant disease caused by the papaya ringspot virus (PRSV).The first PRSV-resistant GM papaya expressing a PRSV coat protein gene was developed by USA scientists in 1992.The first commercial GM papaya cultivars derived from the event was approved by the US government in 1997. Development of transgenic papayas has been focused on vaccine production and limited agricultural traits, including insect and pathogen resistance, long shelf life, and aluminum and herbicide tolerance. Approximately 17 countries, including the USA and China, produced transgenic papayas and/or commercialized them, which provoked studies on biosafety assessment and development of GM-detection technologies.For the biosafety assessment of potential effects on human health, effects of long-term feeding to model animals have been studied in terms of toxicity and allergenicity. Studies on environmental safety assessment include influence on soilmicrobial biodiversity and transfer to soil bacteria of GM selection markers. Many countries, such as Korea, the European Union, and Japan, that have strict regulations for GM crops have serious concerns about unintended introduction of GM cultivars and food commodities using unauthorized GM crops. Transgene- and/or GM event-specific molecular markers and technologies for genomics-based detection of unauthorized GM papaya have been developed and have resulted in the robust detection of GM papayas."

The results of the structural equation modeling analysis focusing on the principal's transformational leadership, class improvement activities, teacher cooperation, and learning organization climate in schools were as follows. First, teacher efficacy was found to be strongly influenced by degree of participation in class improvement activities and degree of cooperation among teachers. Second, the transformational leadership of the principals had a significant influence on improving the teacher efficacy. In addition, it was found to have a positive effect on class improvement activities and learning organization climate of the school. Third, it was identified that creating a leaning community climate in which teachers regularly study about educational activities does not directly relate to teacher efficacy. Fourth, among teachers' background variables, teacher efficacy was lower in secondary school teachers than elementary teachers. Especially, in the case of the secondary school, the transformational leadership of the principal was lower and the learning organization climate of the school was found to be weaker than the elementary school. On the other hand, secondary teachers showed more participation in class improvement activities than elementary teachers. In order to improve the teacher efficacy based on the results above, it is important for the teachers to actively participate in the class improvement activities and to widen the opportunities to cooperate with each other. It is also necessary to promote the principal's innovative leadership to respect the opinions of teachers, encourage teachers to participate in decision making at school, and pay attention to teacher's innovative ideas on teacher learning and learning."
Genetic parameter estimation for milk β-hydroxybutyrate and acetone in early lactation and its association with fat to protein ratio and energy balance in Korean Holstein cattle,2018,"['Energy Balance', 'Fat Protein Ratio', 'Heritability', 'Repeatability Model', 'Genetic Parameters']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters for milk β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), acetone (Ac), fat protein ratio (FPR), and energy balance (EB) using milk test day records and investigate the effect of early lactation FPR and EB on milk ketone body concentrations.Methods: Total 262,940 test-day records collected from Korea Animal Improvement Association during the period of 2012 to 2016 were used in this study. BHBA and Ac concentrations in milk were measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). FPR values were obtained using test day records of fat and protein percentage. EB was calculated using previously developed equation based on parity, lactation week, and milk composition data. Genetic parameters were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood procedure based on repeatability model using Wombat program.Results: Elevated milk BHBA and Ac concentrations were observed during the early lactation under the negative energy balance. Milk FPR tends to decrease with the decreasing ketone body concentrations. Heritability estimates for milk BHBA, Ac, EB, and FPR ranged from 0.09 to 0.14, 0.23 to 0.31, 0.19 to 0.52, and 0.16 to 0.42 respectively at parity 1, 2, 3, and 4. The overall heritability for BHBA, Ac, EB and FPR were 0.29, 0.32, 0.58, and 0.38 respectively. A common pattern was observed in heritability of EB and FPR along with parities.Conclusion: FPR and EB can be suggested as potential predictors for risk of hyperketonemia. The heritability estimates of milk BHBA, Ac, EB, and FPR indicate that the selective breeding may contribute to maintaining the milk ketone bodies at optimum level during early lactation."

Heart beat measurement that reflects cardiac activities has been used in various fields such as exercise evaluation and psychological state evaluation for a long time, but its utilization method is limited due to its differentiation from clinical electrocardiogram. Therefore, in this study, we could observe the change of the measured signal according to the change of the distance and the position of the measuring electrodes which are non-standard electrode configuration. Based on the electric dipole model of the heart, correlation with clinical electrocardiogram could be confirmed by synthesizing multiple surface potentials measured with a shorter electrode distance than standard one. From the electromagnetic point of view, the distance between the measuring electrodes corresponds to the distance that the electric potential by the cardiac electric dipole moves, and the electric potential measured at the body surface is proportional to the moving distance of the electric potential. Therefore, it is preferable to make the distance between electrodes as long as possible, and to position the measuring electrode close to the ventricle rather than the atrium. In addition, it was found that standard electrocardiographic waveforms could be synthesized by using arithmetic sum of multiple measuring electrodes due to the relationship of electrical dipole vectors, which is obtained by dividing and positioning a plurality of measuring electrodes on a reference electrode line, such as Lead-I, Lead-II direction. Also, we obtained a significant Pearson correlation coefficient (r = 0.9113 ± 0.0169) as a result of synthetic experiments on four subjects."

The raw GPS data contained long- and short-periodic position changes and noisy signals at different frequencies. To extract the significant results from this complex dataset, the general structure and components of the GPS signal were modeled and analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Uncontrolled jumps and deviations involving the signal in the time domain were pre-filtered. Then, the signal was converted to the frequency domain after applying low- and high-pass filters, and the frequency and periodic component values were calculated. The spectrum of the tower motion obtained from the filtered GPS data had dominant peaks at a low frequency of $1.15572{\times}10-4Hz$ and a high frequency of 0.16624 Hz, consistent with two equivalent GPS datasets. Then, the signal was reconstructed using inverse Fourier transform with the dominant low frequency values to obtain filtered and interpretable clean signals. With the proposed sequence, processing of noisy data collected from the GPS receivers mounted very close to the structure is effective in revealing the basic behaviors and features of buildings."

This book is a work thatshows a crucial turning point in the development of Foucault’s power theory. It means theculmination of Foucault’s power concept, which has been going on since “The Order ofDiscourse” in the 1970s, and anticipates his power theory to be unfolded in the late 70s. Asmost of his lectures in the Collège de France and talks have been recently published, theoverall outline of his power theory is being revealed. Foucault sought various ways to definethe concept of power by 1975. First, in the light of the evolution of the concept of power,Foucault moves the field of power from the state or political structure to the society. He urgesthat power be understood as a strategy to be exercised, not possessed, and that power is understoodas a power relationship that inherently includes the relationship between resistanceand power. In particular, The History of Sexuality 1: The Will to Knowledge deepens and extendsthe concept of power as a ubiquitous, productive and resistant concept that is spreadingthroughout the social body. Second, in terms of the form of power, Foucault’s concept ofpower begins by criticizing the traditional sovereign power that defines human beings as legaland ideological subjects and goes, through disciplinary power that trains bodies and makesthem docile, into biopower that manages and controls population(social body). The workthat displays this expansion and development of power is The History of Sexuality 1: The Will toKnowledge. This paper examines Foucault’s theory of power from disciplinary power to biopowerin detail."

In this article, the author tries to reconstruct the formation of Old Chosun by looking at the inflow of bronze metallurgy, the development of the weapons system, and ritual formation instead of using archaeological materials as subsidiary evidence for literary history. The bronze culture of early Old Chosun was first formed in Bohai Basin area, under the influence of the Upper Xiajiadian culture; as the Upper Xiajiadian culture weakened, the Shiertaiyingzi (十二臺營子) culture of Bohai region, represented by bronze mirrors with multiple knobs (多紐鏡) and lute-shaped daggers formed local networks which were connected with the Liaodong region and the Korean Peninsula. These networks were maintained by the high-end technology of bronze metallurgy as well as the sharing of a common shamanistic ritual tradition. The first appearance of Old Chosun, recorded in Chinese historical literature of the pre-Chin period in the 7th to 4th centuries BCE, reflects this network group which stretched from the Bohai area to the northwestern part of Korea. The center and distribution of this network constantly changed, and around the 4th century BCE, Old Chosun and its surrounding communities underwent a transformation from a network community to an early state based on territorial governance.From the 4th century BCE, the Liaoxi region was strongly influenced by the cultural and political inflow of the Yan dynasty. In contrast to this change, each area of Manchuria and Korea witnessed the autonomous developments of states. The Old Chosun network of the Liaodong area was integrated into Shangbucun (上堡村) Yinjiacun (尹家村) types. The Xihuangshantun (西荒山屯) type in the Songhua River basin developed into the early stage of Buyeo. In South Korea, the Namsungri type developed into the early stage of Samhan society. As the network along the coast of the Bohai Basin collapsed, Old Chosun expanded its trade network into the continental part of Manchuria, to the Baekdu (Changbai) Mountainous area and far eastern part of Russia (Primorie). The structure also referred to as “the Great Wall of the Yan Dynasty”, reaching from the Liaobei area to Jilin Province was also built around this time. These sites do not indicate the movement of political forces of China to the Old Chosun area, but rather the competing trade routes connecting the continent parts of Manchuria with Old Chosun. Although the ritual network involving the bronze mirror with multiple knobs collapsed in Old Chosun and neighboured regions in Manchuria, in contrast, this network flourished in the southern part of Korea with the inflow of the slender dagger culture. In this way, the bronze culture of Old Chosun played a significant role in ancient state formation in Manchuria and Korea."

The data was from GEPS 2016(5th year, 855 teachers) and analyzed by hierarchical regression model using Enter method. The findings of this study are as follows. Firstly, the perceived help degree of TLC has a statistically significant effect only on the instructional efficacy, but the number of TLC and the number of times of running TLC in school are not affected. Secondly, teachers education career, the perceived help degree from teacher training, teacher cooperation and the school principal s transformational leadership showed statistically significant effect on teacher efficacy and sub-factors(instructional efficacy & student guidance efficacy). And decisional power of teachers has a positive effect only on student guidance efficacy. Based on these, suggestions for enhancing teacher efficacy are as follows. First, TLC should provide substantial help to improve teacher professionalism. Second, TLC should be operated on the basis of voluntary cooperation of teachers. Third, TLC needs the principal’s transformational leadership and the decisional power of teachers."
Low Phase-noise Voltage-controlled Oscillator for Wireless Personal Area Networks,2018,"['VCO', 'Phase noise', 'Voltage controlled oscillator', 'Millimeter wave', 'FOM']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A novel tuning technique is presented here for 60 GHz applications. Coarse and fine tuning is performed using an octagonal transformer and a metal-oxide semiconductor variable capacitor (varactor), respectively. For the LC tanks inductive element, a transformer is used in which switches are placed at primary and secondary coils to tune the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The classical P- type metal-oxide semiconductor varactor is used as a fine-tuning element with the advantage being that a linear frequency tuning range (FTR) is obtained. In each obtained band, the varactor provides a frequency range of approximately 2.9 GHz. Simulation shows that by on/off switches, obtain three frequency bands (55 GHz to 57.943 GHz, 57.172 GHz to 60.357 GHz, and 59.329 GHz to 62.4 GHz) to cover the whole V-band (60 GHz) frequency. The proposed 60 GHz VCO is designed and simulated using United Microelectronics Corporation’s 65 nm single poly 8 metal (1P810) complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology. The FTR is from 55 GHz to 62.4 GHz with phase noise variation from -116.5 dBc/Hz to -114.5 dBc/Hz at a 10 MHz offset from the carrier. For the entire FTR, the calculated figure of merit is from 182.8239 dBc/Hz to -181.4564 dBc/Hz."

This study examines the creation of the Ttukseom Pleasure Ground and the processthrough which the pleasure ground were transformed to a park. This study also explores its landscape and cultural aspects.In the 1930s, Gyeongseonggwedo (京城軌道), a private railway company, built a pleasure ground at Ttukseom to attractpassengers, according to the business model of Japanese railway companies, in which recreational areas were developed near railwayroutes. Mass media portrayed this area as a ""rural landscape"" in contrast to the city. The Ttukseom Pleasure Ground emergedas a popular summer resort for Gyeongseong citizens. At the same time, it was managed by Gyeongseongbu (京城府).The city of Seoul began to manage the Ttukseom Pleasure Ground following independence, and development plans for Ttukseomas a pleasure ground or a park were continuously drafted but never implemented.Even after Korea's independence, the operation and use of the pleasure ground did not change significantly from the colonialera. In the late 1980s, the Ttukseom Pleasure Ground became the Ttukseom Han River Citizen's Park, and the sandy beach ofthe Han River was removed. Nonetheless, the previous facilities and major activities such as an open-air swimming pool, campground, and areas for boat recreation remained as major park programs. When the urbanization of Ttukseom was completed, itsidyllic image disappeared and it became a park instead of a pleasure ground. Since parks expand their programs, it can be concludedthat by providing those kinds of programs, the Ttukseom Pleasure Ground transformed to a park."

Affected by the transformation into a “global metropolis” under British colonial rule, Hong Kong’s urban identity came to rest on hostility to the rural. In this article, I examine the ways in which perceptions of the rural are changing in Hong Kong.In the wake of resistance by Xinjie (New Territories) residents to Great Britain’s lease of Northern Hong Kong in 1898, the colonial government adopted a special policy protecting traditional customs.However, those native customs deemed worthy of protection were overwhelmingly patriarchal, as exemplified by the “small house policy.” For the Hong Kong people at large, the “rural” and “tradition” symbolized by the Xinjie region mainly signified privileged and fossilized traditional culture.This situation changed with the Choi Yuen village dispute in 2008.The dispute revealed that non-indigenous inhabitants wanted to preserve the “traditional” lifestyle while indigenous inhabitants simply aimed to protect narrow interests under the banner of “tradition.” The Choi Yuen village dispute was ultimately significant because it induced the Hong Kong people to discuss the definition and meaning of land. This is greatly important for Hong Kong, where agricultural self-sufficiency is relatively poor. Through the Choi Yuen village dispute, the Hong Kong people began to take an interest in local agriculture, leading to greater awareness of the serious problems related to the rent and use of land. It may also lead to new possibilities for “right to the city” discussions, where consideration of the rural has been ambiguous.Choi Yuen village dispute was followed by resistance to another development project, the Northeast New Territories New Development Areas Planning. Such opposition, however, has become entangled with anti-China movements, excessively emphasizing the sense of crisis regarding “mainland invasion.” Such a conservative swing is bound to occur where critical self-examination of Hong Kong identity is lacking. One should be weary of the potential for these movements to become entangled with anti-Chinese sentiment."

Previous studies concentrated on firm level data. In this paper I tested the relationship with aggregated data. I assess the short run and long run effects of exchange rate volatility on domestic investment using time series data. The results indicate that exchange rate volatility has significant short run effects on domestic investment and this short run effects are transformed to the long run effects. I used the error correction model of Johansen. Exchange rate volatility decreased the investment. This imply that exchange rate depreciations could be expected to increase export in the short run since it can be a factor to discourage investment and then the international competitiveness as well as the potential growth capability. So the policy makers related to exchange rate operation policy would consider that exchange rate appreciation can lead to expand investment and consumption in the short run and the potential growth capability in the long run rather than passive policy to hold back the appreciation pressure through exchange market interventions. Exchange rate operation policy should be directed to minimizing the exchange rate volatility.

A Study on the Development of Global Competitiveness Index for Local Governments in Korea,2018,"['Aggregate Indicator', 'Global Competitiveness Index', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Unobserved Component Model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose - Since 2008, A.T. Kearney has published a Global Cities Index (GCI), which has been evaluated in five areas and 27 detailed evaluation indicators, in 60 major cities in 40 countries. In this study, we selected various indicators necessary for the construction of global competitiveness index of local governments in Korea based on the evaluation system of A.T. Kearney. Through the process of indicator selection, normalization, and aggregation using various weights the global competitiveness index of 16 local governments were calculated, compared and analyzed. Research, design, data and methodology - The study selected 13 indicators of 16 local governments to construct the global competitiveness index. In normalization of transforming individual indicators the parametric method of z-score standardization and nonparametric method which is free from the distribution types are used. Nonparametric methods used in this study include rescale with respect to the maximum value, range standardization, and inter-decile range standardization. In aggregation the global competitiveness index was calculated using weights derived from Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP), Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and Unobserved Components Model(UCM). Results - The rankings of global competitiveness index using various combinations of normalization method and weight-determination method were calculated and compared. The correlation between the ranks was statistically significant, which implies that all measurement methods are meaningful and useful. It was also found that the method of standardization does not affect the ranking of the composite index while the method of determining the weights affects the ranking of the composite index. Although both the PCA and UCM methods have their advantages and disadvantages in determining weights and making composite index, it is judged that individual indicators can be selected by PCA and then the composite index are developed by UCM in terms of the usefulness of the study. Conclusions - The method for aggregating indicators used in this study is designed to calculate the level, ranking, and confidence interval of a global competitive index. Therefore, it enables us to overcome the limitations of simply calculating the level an ranking of a composite index by arbitrary weight. This method is expected to be very useful in other areas of study."
Evolutionary multi-objective optimization of energy efficiency in electrical discharge machining,2018,"['EDM', 'Discharge energy', 'Machining performance', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Two-objective optimization', 'Pareto optimal set']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Electrical energy, which in the machining zone is transformed into heat, is of key importance in electrical discharge machining (EDM).Machining performance of EDM is determined by the characteristic of discharge energy. Therefore, an experimental-analytical approach of discharge energy efficiency was analyzed. The main input parameters for controlling the discharge energy are discharge current and discharge duration. The EDM process is monitored considering the two output machining performance, i.e., material removal rate and surface roughness, which are important for increasing productivity and quality. We modeled the energy efficiency of electrical discharge machining by the use of genetic algorithm. With this action an attempt was made to find even more precise dependence of discharge energy parameters with machining performance. Finally, this was followed by optimization of the discharge energy efficiency in EDM process using multi-objective approach. Evolutionary two-objective optimization is leading to the set of optimal solutions for the discharge energy considering the two machining parameters. Using this set of solutions, EDM discharge energy parameters can be selected to achieve high material removal rate with good surface roughness."
A Multivariate Tobit Estimation of Rural Land Rental and Labor Market Participation Decisions of Farm Households in Ethiopia,2018,"['다변량 Tobit 모형', '농지 임대시장', '농촌노동시장', '내생성', 'multivariate Tobit model', 'rural land rental market', 'rural labor market', 'endogeneity']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The paper tries to identify factors that affect rural households’ joint participation in rural labor and land rental markets. The study used a multivariate Tobit/mixed model that considers the existence of endogeneity and cross-equations interdependences to analyze rural land rental and labor markets. The estimation results show households who are well endowed with economically active labor force, oxen, a social network, and farming resources are more likely to participate as a tenant in land rental markets. Similarly, landless and near-landless households as well participate as a tenant in land rental markets. In contrast, households who are less endowed with farming skills and farming inputs are more likely to rent out their land and then engage in off-farm work. As a result, it is momentous to design a proper policy that promotes and reshapes the rural financial service for smallholder farmers for both on-farm and off-farm activities. We found that education is the most valuable asset for rural farm households to pursue opportunities in agriculture, obtain skilled off-farm work, and start a business in the rural non-farm economy. Yet, the education level in rural Ethiopia is very low. Hence, it is important to design appropriate basic adult educational programs, and open farmers training centers for rural farmers that promote technical and business skills in the agriculture and rural off-farm economy. Off-farm employments absorb surplus labor from agriculture. Hence, it is important to design appropriate policy in order to improve the rural off-farm economy in a rural part of the country. Finally, we recommend policy makers to see the off-farm economy as one component of rural growth and transformation strategy and remove any barriers that limit farmers’ entry to off-farm employments."

Though there have been numerous studies regarding apartment housing, only few studies have been performed about the building arrangement. The arrangement has been poorly treated and not well disclosed as compared with other apartment-based research such as form of residential towers, floor plan, etc. The building arrangement is one of the most critical decisions at the early design stage and is affected by numerous social aspects such as building/zoning code, market demand, cultural preference, etc. Thus, the transformation of the arrangement may provide the hint for the change of socio-cultural demands of apartment housing. The research has been done on the existing 269 apartment complexes which have been built through 2016 in Busan. There are three categories set for analysis: relationship between buildings, relation between road and buildings, and the building arrangement along site perimeter. The result shows that significant change has occurred since 2000s; the arrangement has become diverse from three types to seven types. The early model of parallel or lattice types have been dominant until 2000, but the skewed one replaced the parallel or lattice types in Period V and Period VI, which is from 2001 through 2016."

Beyond dRGT as mimetic massive gravity,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>An interesting proposal has recently been made to extend massive gravity models beyond dRGT by a disformal transformation of the metric. In this Letter we want to note that it can be viewed as a mimetic extension of dRGT gravity which enormously simplifies the Hamiltonian analysis.

Integration of an Iterative Update of Sparse Geologic Dictionaries with ES-MDA for History Matching of Channelized Reservoirs,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>This study couples an iterative sparse coding in a transformed space with an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ES-MDA) for providing a set of geologically plausible models that preserve the non-Gaussian distribution of lithofacies in a channelized reservoir. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) of sand-shale facies is followed by the repetition of K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) in order to construct sparse geologic dictionaries that archive geologic features of the channelized reservoir such as pattern and continuity. Integration of ES-MDA, DCT, and K-SVD is conducted in a complementary way as the initially static dictionaries are updated with dynamic data in each assimilation of ES-MDA. This update of dictionaries allows the coupled algorithm to yield an ensemble well conditioned to static and dynamic data at affordable computational costs. Applications of the proposed algorithm to history matching of two channelized gas reservoirs show that the hybridization of DCT and iterative K-SVD enhances the matching performance of gas rate, water rate, bottomhole pressure, and channel properties with geological plausibility.</P>"
Effective time-frequency characterization of Lamb wave dispersion in plate-like structures with non-reflecting boundaries,2018,"['Lamb wave dispersion', 'non-reflecting boundary', 'slant-stack transformation', 'short-time fourier transformation', 'classical laminated plate theory', 'plate-like structures']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Research on Lamb wave-based damage identification in plate-like structures depends on precise knowledge of dispersive wave velocity. However, boundary reflections with the same frequency of interest and greater amplitude contaminate direct waves and thus compromise measurement of Lamb wave dispersion in different materials. In this study, non-reflecting boundaries were proposed in both numerical and experimental cases to facilitate time-frequency characterization of Lamb wave dispersion. First, the Lamb wave equations in isotropic and laminated materials were analytically solved. Second, the non-reflecting boundaries were used as a series of frames with gradually increased damping coefficients in finite element models to absorb waves at boundaries while avoiding wave reflections due to abrupt property changes of each frame. Third, damping clay was sealed at plate edges to reduce the boundary reflection in experimental test. Finally, the direct waves were subjected to the slant-stack and short-time Fourier transformations to calculate the dispersion curves of phase and group velocities, respectively. Both the numerical and experimental results suggest that the boundary reflections are effectively alleviated, and the dispersion curves generated by the time-frequency analysis are consistent with the analytical solutions, demonstrating that the combination of non-reflecting boundary and time-frequency analysis is a feasible and reliable scheme for characterizing Lamb wave dispersion in plate-like structures."

By using smart devices that enable users to be connected anytime and anywhere, mIM users can exchange real-time messages that enhance their interpersonal relationships and social belonging. To continuously retain and attract users to their mobile platforms, mIM service providers are extending their business models to provide online-to-offline (O2O) services. This study investigates the extent to which mIM user satisfaction affects loyalty toward and satisfaction with O2O services delivered on mIM mobile platforms. The antecedents to user satisfaction are also measured by evaluating consumers' perception of O2O and mIM service quality performance. The empirical findings are drawn from 335 Korean respondents that use Korea's dominant mIM application, KakaoTalk, and its related O2O services. The study finds that mIM satisfaction positively influences O2O satisfaction. Attitudinal and behavioral loyalty are also observed among users satisfied with O2O services. By using cooperative approaches to enhancing the perceived service quality of both new and existing services, mIM service providers are encouraged to create value-added services and secure their sustainable competitive advantage.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Core service (mIM) satisfaction positively affects new service (O2O) satisfaction. </LI> <LI>  O2O service satisfaction leads to loyalty towards O2O services. </LI> <LI>  Core service (mIM) satisfaction does not lead to new service (O2O) loyalty. </LI> <LI>  O2O and mIM service quality are examined as antecedents to user satisfaction. </LI> </UL> </P>"

This type of behaviors includes doings such as spreading negative information about someone, threatening others, not paying attention during work meetings, and isolating a specific person from social activities. However organizational incivility differs from other types of antisocial behaviors such as violence and aggression in that it is low-intensity behavior with unclear intentionality. Findings from organizational incivility studies suggest that targets or observers of uncivil events experience diverse negative work-related outcomes such as having troubles with focusing on their work, poor job performance, and worrying about occurrences of uncivil events. Those individuals additionally exposed to physical and psychological health problems.  However the impact of organizational incivility is not limited to individuals in an organization but expands to the entire organization, including work groups. Organizational incivility spiral suggests for the potential that incivility can jeopardize the whole organization in that it can lead to a series of “secondary spirals” by targets and the people who observed those uncivil events. This means that incivility could have negative impact on various aspects of organizational performance. However, most incivility studies have been conducted around individual work outcomes. The current study takes a broader view in studying negative impact of incivility on organizations. Drawing on the spiral model of incivility and the literature on transformational leadership, the study focuses on examining the negative effect on incivility on perceived teamwork and subsequently on knowledge sharing among team members. Moreover the moderating effect of transformational leadership on the link between incivility and teamwork has been examined. The results of a series of hypotheses tests showed that organizational incivility has negative effect on teamwork, and knowledge sharing through perceived teamwork across workgroup members. The testing of moderation showed a result which is somewhat different from the hypothesized relationship. However the result was still consistent with the hypothesis in that the use of transformational leadership helps to mitigate the negative impact of incivility.  Maintaining high levels teamwork and knowledge sharing is crucial for most companies to compete effectively in the market. The current study contributes to the incivility literature by pointing out the positive effect of transformational leadership in mitigating the negative influence of incivility. Moreover the study claims that organizational incivility should be considered as problems to be resolved by managers and executives rather than as problems to be managed by individuals who are involved. Research and practical implications for effective management of organizational incivility are discussed."

This study is a method to positively express the viewer's self in an interactive Hangeul system. The proposed system produces new formative shapes and meanings of Hangeul through the process of deconstructing and reconstructing the characters. Immediate character transformations that are synchronized with the motion of the viewer act as a tool of self-expression by inducing the viewer's active interaction repeatedly. Therefore, the proposed interactive Hangeul is more than enough to be used as a new graphic tool beyond the text to be read, and it is highly likely to develop into cultural contents using it."

To build these maps, the research team in September 2016 began to collect geographical and cultural data from historical texts for its database. At the same time, the cultural information from original analog texts were extracted and transformed into a digital XML (Extensible Markup Language) format.Some errors were made in the process of creating the database due to both digital and human errors. Digital errors resulted from the configuration process of codifying data, which was done by way of a one-to-one match regardless of cultural varieties and variability. Human errors occurred due to researchers’ negligence and insufficient knowledge of digitalization in the analysis of cultural elements, to the project’s three-year time limit, and to variations in the database in terms of areas, periods, and languages. Human and digital errors resulted from the steady interplay between researchers, texts, and digital data.The diversity of texts and personnel probably disturbed digitalization as well as stimulated the drive for new human-centered digitalization. A revolutionary digital transformation of the Silk Roads relies on the credibility and interactivity of data, and variables in history and cultures, despite any unstable deficiencies in the digitized data."

Lone Star Funds, being a party in a series of high-profile tax disputes dealt with at the Supreme Court, has been at the center of this international tax avoidance controversy. Among the Lone Star tax cases, this paper reviews the Permanent Establishment(PE) taxation by the National Tax Service on the profits of Lone Star Fund Ⅳ derived from its investment in Korea Exchange Bank and others. In this case, the Supreme Court held that there was no PE or deemed PE with respect to the activities of domestic affiliates of the Lone Star Fund Ⅳ and some of Lone Star’s partners in Korea.When it comes to the PE issue of private equity funds, in theory one may not rule out the possibility of the constitution of a PE. Relying on the existing case law of focusing on the essential and significant nature of the activity of the enterprise, the Supreme Court in this case found that the major activities such as gathering of investors, decision on investment, alienation of the assets and recuperation of the investment return have taken place in the United States while the activities of domestic affiliates like LSAK/HAK and some partners of the private equity firm have been at best of a preparatory and auxiliary nature, so that no PE or deemed PE have existed. In the author’s view, the decision of the Supreme Court is a reasonable and proper finding on the question of whether there was a PE of the private equity fund by taking into account the essential nature of the fund and all the relevant facts and circumstances of the domestic activities of the fund.On the other hand, with the signing of Multilateral Instrument implementing BEPS and 2017 update of the OECD Model Tax Convention as part of the OECD/G20 BEPS Actions on preventing tax avoidance of Multinational Enterprises, the traditional PE concept is being significantly transformed to include formerly non-PE constituting activities. Furthermore, the recent global discourse on the digital economy and taxation floats the significant economic or digital presence as a concept to complement or even replace the traditional PE concept. Accordingly, taking stock of these developments and changes in PE concept, the government should grapple with the way forward to design a relevant international tax legislation and tax treaty policy that can secure fair and legitimate taxation right of the country."

Also, there is a high demand for exhibition and education program development as a theme that visitors are interested in. The purpose of this study was to develop an educational program for exhibiting the Big Bang theme. To do this, we identify the difficulty of learning the big bang theme from the perspective of model based learning theory and set up the following hypothetical strategies to overcome them. First, it is necessary to make theme close to visitors’ ordinary experience. For this purpose, one strategy was used that subjects that are close to everyday life and everyday instructional tools.Second, we used visual analogies to make it easy for visitors to organize concepts related to science principles and big bang. Third, rather than comprehending the scientific principles constituted by causality, the contents related to the big bang were transformed into a narrative story. Based on the hypothetical strategy described above, the educational program for the exhibition of the big bang theme was developed as the theme of 'big bang nuclear synthesis', 'stellar nuclear synthesis', 'expanding universe' and 'revolution of astronomy'.The developed educational program was mainly applied to elementary school students as a special program, and the questionnaire was applied to the effect. The results of the questionnaire showed that participation and interest of the educational programs were high and the level of the education program was suitable for elementary school students except for difficulties such as terminology.After participating in the education program, many visitors shared their big bang experience with others, and they wanted to visit another big bang science museums and to participate in other big bang educational programs."

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase), which converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to oxaloacetate (OAA) using bicarbonate, is a key metabolic enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the C4 photosynthetic pathway. Two transgenic <I>P. tricornutum</I> lines overexpressing PtPEPCase1 (PtPEPC1, JGI protein ID: 27976) were constructed and their photosynthetic productivity, cell growth, and biomass were characterized. The levels of PtPEPC1 mRNAs in the two transgenic lines were increased by 2.3 and 11.2-fold and the amounts of the PEPCase protein by 1.3 and 2.3-fold, respectively. PtPEPC1 was targeted to mitochondria. Addition of bicarbonate to the <I>P. tricornutum</I> culture increased biomass of the transformants by about 12% compared to wild type, and their maximum specific growth rate in exponential phase was about 10% greater than that of wild type. The transformants also exhibited higher photosynthetic productivity.

The missionary life through Jesus’ kenosis is revealed through His incarnation ― life and death on the Cross. Jesus came as the Servant to serve others; likewise, one needs to imitate the self-emptying life of Christ. Jesus’ self-emptying is portrayed in the biblical passage Philippians 2:7-8, which provides the biblical pattern for missionary leadership (self-emptying - servant posturing - embracing humanity - kenotic humility - transformative obedience). In short, this pattern resolves the limits of the older styles of charismatic leadership.Contemporary leadership, however, is often accomplished by means of hierarchical paradigms that dominate and discriminate against people. Leadership based on paternal authority can obstruct one’s leadership succession. For example, leadership succession where the missionary has retained a paternal and ethnocentric leadership style without changing their approach. Clearly, one frequently carries out one’s own ministry without either leadership succession or an exit strategy before one’s arrival in the mission field. Although the missionary makes leadership succession, s/he often misses succession timing, so this can hinder local churches from growing.For instance, the Korean church grew rapidly by adopting the Nevius principles (self-support, self-government, self-propagation), specifically, economic self-support. But the issue of leadership succession in the mission field does not only concern being economically self-supported. In this regard, Tom Steffen’s leadership succession complements the weak points of the previous models of leadership succession.To sum up, Jesus’ kenosis is a comprehensive idea for an incarnational missionary strategy, and is practically applicable to the mission field. Furthermore, self-emptying is the starting point for a missionary to trust and commit to God entirely, while at the same time, kenosis is the humble courage for one to have relationship with the local people. This concept provides the motivation needed to develop more adequate missionary leadership."

The nodes are modeled by single-server queueing systems with a finite buffer and an exponential service time distribution. Customers arrive to the network according to a Markovian arrival process. The number of customers, which can be processed in the network simultaneously, is restricted by a threshold. If the number of customers in the network is less than this threshold, when a new customer arrives, the customer is processed in the network. Choice of the first and the subsequent nodes for service is performed randomly according to a fixed stochastic vector and a transition probability matrix. If the number of customers in the network at the customer arrival epoch is equal to the threshold, the customer is queued into an input buffer with an infinite capacity. Customers in the input buffer are impatient. The stationary behavior of network states is analyzed. The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the distribution of the customer’s waiting time in the input buffer is obtained. Expressions for computing performance measures of the network are derived. Numerical results are presented. The model is suitable, e.g., for analysis and optimization of wireless telecommunication networks and manufacturing systems with a finite number of machines and workers.</P>"

The LETKF data assimilation cycle for evaluating the performance improvement due to ASCAT observation was carried out for approximately 20 days from June through July 2017 when Typhoon Nepartak was present. As a result, we have found that the performance of ASCAT wind vector has a clear and beneficial effect on the data assimilation cycle. It has reduced analysis errors of wind, temperature, and humidity, as well as analysis errors of lower troposphere wind. Furthermore, by the assimilation of the ASCAT wind observation, the initial condition of the model described the typhoon structure more accurately and improved the typhoon track prediction skill. Therefore, we can expect the analysis field of LETKF will be improved if the Scatterometer wind observation is added."

While speaker identification can be widely applied in fields such as security authentication, access control, personalization and intelligent robot control, a solution needs to be found for the inconsistency between training and test data caused by noise due to real environment factors. In this paper, we propose a speaker identification system based on convolution-pooling operation for noise robustness. To model the characteristics of individuals"" speech using the time series characteristics, a sound map was generated using the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) algorithm. The proposed speaker identification system outperforms recognition performance of other machine learning algorithms, and the robustness of noise is verified as a result of the noise insertion at incremental steps."
Queer Experimental Writing in Korean Literature of the 2010s,2018,"['queer', 'experimental writing', 'representation', 'performativity', 'community']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This article examines how queer literature’s experiment in the deconstruction of the representational model addresses not only modernist formalistic aesthetics but also the political imagination of future communities. The three short stories analyzed here transform themselves into a space where the reader actively engages in a visceral relationship with the texts. In this process, the reader becomes an equal player in the supposedly authorial act of textual production. This enmeshment of the author/text/ reader in queer experimental writing embodies an alternative method of social belonging in which the textual existence of literary works enacts an association between anonymous individuals. From the proliferation of queer literature produced in Korea in the 2010s, I have chosen to examine Yun Ihyeong’s “Luka,” Hwang Jeong-eun’s “Bone Thief” and Jeong Jidon’s “The Book of the Future.” These stories all offer themselves as a space for reordering the author/text/reader hierarchy, which makes them representative works of experimental queer writing. In addition, thanks to this feature, the three texts under examination use their performativity to activate the imagination of queer and alternative communities."

The method of this study adopts a structural equation model to test a mediating effect of communication and a moderating effect of change resistance level. This model confirms whether smart work investments provide a positive impact on communication and organizational productivity. In addition, I will classify a change resistance level of smart work by cluster analysis and then check a critical path difference of job productivity between each group. As a result, The organizational IT, institution and culture on the smart work investment appeared to important influencers in communication and also had a direct influence of individual performance. Also, The three independent variables of smart work investment have an indirect influence of individual and organizational performance through communication mediating variables. However, the organizational IT and institution as independent variables do not provide direct influence of organization performance. Nevertheless, two independent variables of organizational IT and institution have an indirect influence the organization performance through communication mediating variables. As a result of confirming a productivity of three groups on organization resistance, there was a difference the individual and organizational performance among groups. The low-level group of organizational resistance showed high coefficient value of performance compared to other groups. The group analysis implications, The smart work investment appeared significantly to revise the institution first, build culture secondly and advanced technology lastly. The theoretical implication from this study contributes an extension of social science theory through socio-technical systems, institution, culture, change resistance and job performance based on smart work. The practical implications explain the smart work success in step-by-step investment rather than radical investment as level management of change resistance. In future research, the smart work performance between private and public firms will analyze a difference of the organizational culture, institution, technology and performance."
Online system identification of mini cropped delta UAVs using flight test methods,2018,"['UAV', 'Online system identification', 'Real time parameter estimation', 'Least square', 'Delta wing', 'Recursive Fourier transform']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The current manuscript presents the longitudinal and lateral directional online parameter estimation of two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using sequential Least Squares formulation in frequency domain. The two fixed wing UAVs share a similar cropped delta planform and differ in their cross sectional geometries, one with a rectangular and the other being a reflex airfoil cross sections respectively. Recursive Fourier Transform algorithm has been used to convert the flight data in time domain to frequency domain which is measured by means of a dedicated on-board data acquisition system capable of on-board logging and telemetry to ground station. The combination of Sequential Least Squares with Recursive Fourier Transform (SLS-RFT) in frequency domain can be used to carry out online parameter estimation. An attempt has been made to check the applicability of the current method to estimate parameters from the generated flight data of the two UAVs using both conventional as well as random control inputs. Results showed that the parameters estimated, using SLS-RFT, from the linear flight data are consistent and in close agreement with the obtained parameters from full scale wind tunnel testing of UAVs. It was also observed that the estimates from the manoeuvres with multistep control inputs converged faster compared to the parameters obtained from the manoeuvres with slow varying control surface deflections. The time varying linear aerodynamic parametric model of SLS-RFT was able to capture the dynamics of the flights with nonlinear aerodynamics. Certain limitations of the current online system identification method were also observed with estimating parameters from the flight data of UAVs performing near stall manoeuvres. The estimated parameters using SLS-RFT are also compared with the results obtained from batch methods namely classical Maximum Likelihood (ML) and neural based Neural–Gauss–Newton (NGN) methods.</P>"

Various types of numerical models have been developed to simulate the generation and propagation of tsunami waves. Most of tsunami models determine the initial surface of the water based on the assumption that the movement of the seabed is immediately and identically transmitted to the sea surface. However, this approach does not take into account the characteristics of underwater earthquakes that occur with time history and spatial variation. Thus, such an incomplete description on the initial generation of tsunami waves is totally reflected in the error during the simulation. In this study, the analytical solution proposed by Hammack (1973) was applied in the tsunami model in order to simulate the generation of initial water surface elevation by the change of water depth with time history and its propagation. The developed solution is expected to identify the relationship among various type of seabed motions, initial surface undulations, and wave speeds of elevated water surfaces."

The system consists of two redundant units attached to the main unit. Initially, in starting, the main unit start working and perform the task. Whenever the main unit fails, one of the redundant units takes the load of the failed unit and the fail unit assigned for repair or waits for repair if the repair facility/repairman available or is not available. After, failure of any one of the redundant unit ceases the other redundant unit take a load of the failed units. Thus, the system will fail if both redundant units fail before the repair of the main unit. An operator is handling the system; hence, the human error can also appear due to mishandling the system at any stage during its operations. All failure rates constant and follows an exponential distribution, but the repair follows two types of distributions general distribution and Gumbel-Hougaard family copula distribution.

Surface properties of the membranes were studied before and after exposure to strong acid using various analytical tools: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), contact angle analyzer, and electrophoretic light scattering spectrophotometer. The characterization and permeation results showed piperazine-based NE40/70 membranes have relatively lower acid-resistance than MPD-based NE90 membrane. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was also conducted to reveal the different acid-tolerances between the piperazine-based and MPD-based polyamide membranes. The easiest protonation was found to be the protonation of oxygen in piperazine-based monomer, and the N-protonation of the monomer had the lowest energy barrier in the rate determining step (RDS). The calculations were well compatible with the surface characterization results. In addition, the energy barrier in RDS is highly correlated with the twist angle (<I>τ</I> <SUB>D</SUB>), which determines the delocalization of electrons between the carbonyl π<SUB>CO</SUB> bond and nitrogen lone pair, and the tendency of the twist angle was also maintained in longer molecules (dimer and trimer).

In addition, we consider various costs (e.g. transaction cost, opportunity cost) and constraints (e.g. liquidity constraint, care constraint) as well as a minimum level of consumption. The main results are as follows. First, it is expected that the transition from conditional social security (CSS) to full basic income (FBI) will certainly increase the labour supply of existing public assistance recipients. Second, the labour supply effects of the transition in income groups at break-even points would be indeterminate. The labour supply effects depend on the relative size between basic income payments and the tax amounts of non-labour income for basic income payments. Spreading effects, i.e. reducing excessive overworking hours and/or increasing working hours which are now too short, can be expected among these groups. The total effects would be almost zero or slightly positive. Third, it is predicted that the labour supply effects of the above-mentioned transformation in the high-income bracket will also be inconclusive in theory due to the reliance on the relative magnitude between income and substitution effects. In this regard, we highlight that basic income can operate mechanisms to share and mitigate possible risks arising from either scenario. Examining the effects, we find extra advantages of FBI over CSS. The size of the opportunity set in groups below the break-even income level would mostly expand. In particular, existing social assistance recipients’ opportunity sets can expand, and their living standards would rise considerably with a high probability. Although the opportunity set for those in the high-income bracket can decrease slightly or substantially, the above-mentioned expected effects and benefits would considerably exceed any losses for those in the high-income class."

On the basis of this, this paper intends to create new prospects for a universal welfare regime.From the perspective of the welfare system, the funds project is a correction or supplement of the Swedish welfare system of the Swedish model centered on ‘redistribution’. However, the funds project shares the ideology of Swedish model and its fundamental premise, I.e. guild socialism and labor-centrism. This paper discusses the limitations of the funds project resulting from this, especially with regard to its three purposes: equalization of property distribution, economic democracy and the correction of excess profit. It then highlights that the alternative to overcome the limitations of the funds project and the Swedish universal welfare system should be based on a new ideology and fundamental premise that is cut off from guild socialism and labor centrism. As an alternative fulfilling this, this paper focuses on theories that suggest that the Common Wealth Fund should be created and basic income should be implemented in the form of dividends as its dividend. As a result, Commons Capital Stock and the basic income as its dividend are presented as alternative prospects for the funds project."

The impact of agricultural activities on urbanization: evidence and implications for India,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"As a part of the development process, India is currently going through a transformation from agriculture based economy to industry and service lead urbanized economy. However, no formal quantitative research has been done on this phenomenon. In this perspective, based on Matsuyama’s (1992. Agricultural productivity, comparative advantage and economic growth. Journal of Economic Theory, 58(2), 317–334. doi:10.1016/0022-0531(92)90057-O) theoretical framework and using panel data model, the impact of agricultural activities on urbanization in India is analyzed in this paper. For the analysis 15 major agricultural states of India are considered for the period of 1981–2015 by sourcing data from mainly Census of India and Ministry of agriculture, government of India. The results indicates that overall agricultural activities measured by share, growth rate and total agricultural production, amount of cultivated land area, amount of rainfall and rural male employment have a negative effect on urbanization. However, some specific agricultural activities such as higher consumption of fertilizer, state government expenditure on agriculture, production of major crops (wheat, bajra and pulses), rural female employment in agriculture, and rural literacy rate have had a positive impact on urbanization. The results also show that the effect of agriculture productivity is positive on urbanization for a less trade open economy like India. Finally, it is suggested that there is need of higher agricultural development in order to achieve a higher level of urbanization in India. For this purpose use of technology in agriculture sector along with higher level rural education is required. Finally, we need to have balanced rural and urban policy for a smooth rural- urban transformation in India."

The adsorbent was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, scanning electronic microscope and thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry.The chemically modified rice straw lignin was of excellent thermal stability and had plenty of primary amines and hydroxyls. Many influence factors such as initial concentration of AuCl4 -, adsorption time and concentration of hydrochloric acid on AuCl4 - were optimized. The maximum adsorption capacity was 783.94 mg·g-1.The equilibrium adsorption time was 600 min. The equilibrium isotherm fitted well with the Langmuir model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was suitable for describing the adsorption of AuCl4 -. Low hydrochloric acid concentration could promote the selectivity of adsorption on AuCl4 -. Combination of ion exchange and reduction was the mechanism. AuCl4 - was adsorbed by ion exchange first and then reduced from hydrochloric acid medium in the form of Au(0) by phenolic hydroxyl."

Promoting effect of Mn and Ti on the structure and performance of Co3O4 catalysts for oxidation of dibromomethane,2018,"['Dibromomethane', 'Catalytic oxidation', 'Co3O4', 'Mn', 'Ti']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Co3O4 catalysts modified with Mn and Ti, prepared by co-precipitation method, were used for catalytic oxidation of dibromomethane (CH2Br2), a model molecule for brominated volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Addition of Ti or Ti + Mn distorted the crystal structure and led to the formation of a Co–O–Ti solid solution. The addition of Mn further enhanced the surface acidity and redox ability of the catalysts. Co–Mn–Ti exhibited the highest activity with a T90 of approximately 234 °C and the highest selectivity to CO2 at low temperatures. Additionally, Co–Mn–Ti showed good stability for at least 30 h at 500 ppm CH2Br2, 0 or 2 vol% H2O, 0 or 500 ppm p-xylene (PX), and 10% O2 at a gas hourly space velocity of 60,000 h−1, and the final products were COx, Br2, and HBr, without the formation of other Br-containing organic byproducts. This high catalytic activity was attributed to its high specific area, high surface acidity, and strong redox property. Furthermore, the synergetic effect of Co, Mn, and Ti made it superior for CH2Br2 oxidation. A plausible reaction mechanism for CH2Br2 oxidation over Co–Mn–Ti catalysts was proposed based on the analysis of the products and in situ diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy results."

Burkina Faso also keeps its identity with worldview and the formation of social value system which is based on myth and animism. To understand ‘the Catfish Myth’ in Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso enables a missionary understanding by understanding identity and phenomena of deterministic community.For Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso, Catfish is not only symbolic, but also a myth and a god. In addition, catfish is a value system that controls the spirit of the Bobo Dioulasso andan incarnation, and ‘the Catfish Myth’ is pure idealism and pure realism that makes clear the relationship between substance and knowledge systems. For them, catfish are not only objects of real faith but also important factors that determine the direction of life.The place of ‘the Catfish Myth’ is not only a sacred place for the Bobo, but also a place where ethnic society can be formed, and a place to bind ethnic communities. Their worship of catfish is not limited to the spirit worshiper, but rather all the Bobo regardless of their religions including Muslims and Protestants. Catfish is a divine being and is the object of worship and prayer for all the Bobo. Beyond the object of belief, ‘the Catfish Myth’ is the spiritual model of all life as well as the belief of the Bobo, and also it is the model of important divine ability in their lives. It can be understood that this myth originated from Africans’ intention to communicate through any real object rather than not be able to directly communicate with the spiritual being. In the end, the Bobo believes that catfish is a ‘divine being’ and an ‘omnipotent being’ through myths within this empirical position, and holds rituals to deep relationship with catfish as a being to guarantee and protect the future of individuals. This catfish myth shows that the Bobo is an organic community that combines the supernatural and the empirical worlds. The Catfish Myth also helps form close groups and lead social cooperation to be sustainable. Through this myth, family and community bonds are strengthened, and themyth naturally becomes reality by giving meaning to their lives.Thus, various transforming missions are necessary to un-derstand the deterministic identity having the community of the Bobo and do missionary works. First of all, we need to practice the investment in people, and serve education and care to change mythical value system in various ways as well as continuing. It is also necessary to explore new missionary fields, and cooperate as a community with existing churches and missionary groups. Finally, it is necessary to present various missional models and build a missional system to change the attitude of the Bobo’s life that have already dominated their spirit and body."

In this study, the rate of gradual change ofshear moduli, mass density and damping constant are assumed to be same. At first, the stress fields in the interface of the FGM layers are derived by using a single dislocation. Then, by determining a distributed dislocation density on the crack surface and by using the Fourier and Laplace integral transforms, the problem are reduce to a system ofsingular integral equations with simple Cauchy kernel. The dynamic stress intensity factors are determined by numerical Laplace inversion and the distributed dislocation technique. Finally, various examples are provided to investigate the effects of the geometrical parameters, material properties, viscous damping and cracks configuration on the dynamic fracture behavior of the interacting cracks."

Load Distribution in Pile Group Embedded in Sandy Soil Containing Cavity,2018,"['cavity', 'pile group', 'sandy soil', 'load distribution', 'efficiency']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The present study investigates the influence of presence of cavities on the bearing capacity and settlement of piled foundation. The work included experiments carried out to study the behavior of pile models constructed in sand with a dry unit weight 16.8 kN/m3.Pile models were tested in a sand container under a load applied through a hydraulic mounted jack and measured using a load cell.Three strain gages were proved to piles to evaluate the strains and then estimate the load transformed to each pile in the group by a strain indicator. Three groups of piles (single pile, group of piles (1 × 2), and group of piles (2 × 2)) were tested in the laboratory as a free standing pile group. A prototype of a cavity was used and placed adjacent to the piles at various distances from the centerline of piles and various depths below the surface. The effect of variation of cavity location (X), cavity depth (Y), and cavity diameter (d) on the load and settlement of the pile and groups of piles has been studied for all tests. It was found that the load in pile increases with increase of (X/D, D is the pile diameter) due to decrease of the zone affected by the presence of cavity. When the cavity is located at a close distance to the pile, it will reduce the soil density and hence decrease the shaft friction along the pile and lead to decrease in the pile failure load. The failure load is not affected by the presence of a cavity at a distance of 5.5 pile diameters at all depths. The presence of the cavity in the soil reduces the ultimate failure load of the pile. For pile group (1 × 2), the reduction rate is about (40% to 80%) at (d/D = 1), while the rate at (d/D = 2) is about 65% to 85%."

It first analyzes the ways in which multiple oppressions Precious suffers in various social institutions such as family, school, and welfare system operate through the emotions of hatred and self-hatred. In so doing, it demonstrates that Precious’s self-hatred against for being a poor black woman is the effect of the intersecting power systems of race, gender, and class that constitute Precious as an object of hatred. Based on an assumption that emotion factors in agency as it affects bodily capacity to act, the paper then focuses on the transformation of Precious’s emotions from self-hatred to self-love as she moves from victimhood toward agency by joining an alternative school to learn how to read and write. It argues that through new encounters with women of color at the school does Precious begin to unlearn her deeply seated self-hatred and to learn how to love herself and others. Developed by not only sharing their lived experiences of marginalization and violence against their race,gender, class, and sexuality but also by building a learning community of mutual support and love, Precious’s self-love is her growing power of understanding of herself and the world surrounding her and of acting upon that newly gained knowledge. Through Precious’s story, the novel emphasizes the importance of both interrogating how such systems of social inequalities as racism, sexism, and classism intersect in oppressing African American women and women of color like Precious by listening to their silenced stories and recognizing how they assert and exert their agency to resist against those intersecting systems of oppression."

By establishing a loose coordination be-tween public teaching and systematic research, French elite chemists cultivated a symbiotic relationship between chemical theory (the affinity table) and model ex-periments (displacement reactions) to transform chemistry into a ‘science’―a genre of systematic knowledge that could be codified and communicated to the literary public and contribute to the maintenance of the state. This development under the most advanced absolutist regime calls for a different understanding of the relation-ship between science and the Enlightenment."

The results showed that both transformational and active transactional leadership had a positive relationship with safety compliance and participation behavior, and organizational safety climate. However, both leadership styles had a negative relationship with accident. In addition, transformational leadership had significant greater effects on safety behaviors and accident than transactional leadership. In contrast, although there were no significant differences, transactional leadership has a greater effect on the safety climate. These findings suggest that active transactional leadership is important in establishing perceived safety climate of employees, whereas transformational leadership is more related with improving employees’ safety behaviors. Therefore, in line with the previous studies of safety leadership, a combination of both transformational and transactional styles will be most beneficial for developing organizational safety management program. Based on these results, practical implications and further research in terms of development for safety leadership program are discussed."

To test this research model, this study collected 102 samples of data using a questionnaire survey on both manufacturing and exporting firms. The partial least squares method is used and the following results are derived from an empirical analysis. First, dynamic capabilities have a positive effect on competitive capabilities, such as product quality, process flexibility, delivery speed, and low cost. Second, product quality and process flexibility have a positive effect on export firm performance. Third, unlike previous research results, this study finds that the competitive capabilities of a firm in the areas of delivery speed and low cost do not significantly affect its performance.

It has shown remarkable developmental dynamism compared to Europe and North America. Despite being one of the late or late-late-developers in terms of industrialization and democratization, some of Asian countries now spearhead the world’s most rapid transformation into the 21st capitalism. I believe that there may be an ideal type of capitalism, but I must admit that there is a variety of capitalism existing in different national forms. Capitalism can take dissimilar forms nationally and regionally, depending on development strategy, state-society relations, class coalition, business-government nexus, labour market structure, industrial relations, corporate governance system, innovative system, and so on. This paper deals with how to study capitalism in Asia from a theoretical and methodological point of view. I propose to approach capitalism as plural forms. I argue that there are some distinct features of capitalism in Asia. Historical perspectives do not tally with the idea of Asian capitalism as being extensions of Western dynamics. It is my contention that Asian capitalism is not homogeneous in that state-interventionist Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia are dissimilar with free market-oriented Singapore and Hong Kong. China is also a special challenge from a comparative capitalism perspective. I also propose to analyse Asian capitalism from a comparative perspective. Comparative analysis of capitalist development will be useful in finding out the similarities and differences across countries in Asia."

This work presents an easy and practical way to express time dependent material`s behavior with direct time discretization on Stieltjes integral equation. In this modeling, time line of Stieltjes integral equation divided into N small steps at the state of general integral form. Under the assumption of linearized strain input, constitutive relation of real material can be approximately determined into component of temporally discretized constitutive relation tensor matrix. This simplification is numerically much easier than the traditional Laplace-Carson transformation or direct time integration method to apply homogenization process of composite material containing time dependent ingredient. To represent the applicability of this model, comparisons were made between the suggested method and test results of solid propellant specimen."

The hydrophobicity of the surface with periodic square arrays of rectangular pillars was assumed to be due to its Cassie−Baxter state. The hydrophilicity of the irradiated flat surface was due to a change in the surface chemical state, not to the Wenzel state. The irradiated surface showed a reduced ratio of the carbon to the oxygen density and an increased hydro-oxide ion band due to surface oxidization and bond-breaking. We fabricated Y-shaped microfluidic channels consisting of hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Flow rates were observed and analyzed for both channels with different injection rates. We also used a confocal fluorescence microscope to observe the flow with high resolution."

A tracking error-transformed variable based on a super-twisting sliding mode surface is constructed for achieving the transient and steady-state time performances of the position of the robotic manipulator, and satisfying the properties of an ordinary sliding mode control. The proposed controller performs the constrained positioning of the robot manipulator without using a complex modeling process or intelligent nonlinear approximations for unknown robot dynamics and uncertainty.The problem of difficult separation of an unknown nonlinear function into known and unknown parts in the conventional variable super-twisting algorithm (STA) is overcome by designing a convenient adaptive law for the unknown function. Thus, the proposed control approach provides both finite-time convergence and constrained tracking error boundedness within a prescribed position range of the robotic manipulator. The effectiveness of the proposed robust control scheme is demonstrated through its experimental application to an industrial articulated robot manipulator and a XY robotic manipulator."

There is still no research model which can clearly answer the question of what “digital humanities research” looks like. However, if we look at the similarities among humanities research which has been deemed to fall under the umbrella of “digital humanities research,” we can see the transformation of humanities knowledge elements from human-composed language to machine-readable data, which allows computers to aid in the interpretation of said information. The author will go a step beyond the fundamental discussion of “what digital humanities is,” to explain the nature of the work of transforming humanities knowledge into data, and what kind of scholarly outputs we can expect from such work. To this end, the author presents research led by the Academy of Korean Studies’ Jangseogak Archives and Cultural Informatics Lab which is based on old documents from paternalistic lineage organizations (munjung). A new form of digital archive of old documents made for a digital humanities framework allows researchers to turn the content of digitized old documents into data. In addition, through the accumulation of data which encompasses “truths” and “stories” discovered via data analysis, organization, and interpretation, an archive of “source materials” can evolve into an archive of “knowledge.” On preliminary level, transforming the content of old documents into data and making it machine readable contributes to humanities research on the lives of people of the past. However, looking forward, the widespread accumulation of such data can create big data on the humanities. And if this humanities big data is connected to big data dealing with contemporary social, academic, and business phenomena, it can serve as a link between the understanding of modern society and the history of the past. Through efforts to allow humanities knowledge to communicate as data, our humanities knowledge can go beyond the boundaries of traditional humanities and negotiate with the larger world, and it can more meaningfully expand the full realm of the humanities as an understanding of humans and society."

Conventional guitar chord classification schemes use, for better feature extraction, computationally demanding pre-processing techniques such as stochastic analysis employing a hidden markov model or an acoustic data filtering and hence are burdensome for real-time chord classifications. For this reason, we construct various perceptron neural networks and convolutional neural networks that use only Fourier tranform for data pre-processing and compare them with dataset obtained by playing an electric guitar. According to our comparison, convolutional neural networks provide optimal performance considering both chord classification acurracy and fast processing time. In particular, convolutional neural networks exhibit robust performance even when only small fraction of low frequency components of the data are used."

The physical mechanism for changes in the EASJ intensity and position caused by TC Soudelor is explored. Results indicate that TC Soudelor would warm the air in the middle and upper troposphere over the Japan Sea and the adjacent areas through stimulating northward propagating teleconnection pattern as well as releasing large amounts of latent heat, which led to increase (decrease) the meridional air temperature gradient to the south (north) below the EASJ axis. As a result, the geopotential height abnormally increased in the upper troposphere, resulting in an anomalous anticyclonic circulation belt along the EASJ axis. Correspondingly, the westerly winds to the north (south) of the EASJ axis intensified (weakened) and the EASJ axis shifted northward by one degree. The case study also suggests that before the extratropical cyclone transition of TC Soudelor, the TC activities had exerted significant impacts on the EASJ through thermodynamic processes."

The Korean economy is founded on export-led corporations, so despite the widening economic gap between rich and poor, it is difficult to raise income tax and corporate tax. The revision of the tax policy is an inevitable necessity for the country to develop country from a “low burden, low welfare” society to a society with a national basic livelihood, where poor people can be assured the basic necessities of life. This research investigates how much the Korean economy can grow in the future. The factors of production have been made accurate with a quadratic regression model, and using those factors with a technology-neutral Cobb Douglas production function, it is possible to predict Korea’s GDP. By analyzing the GDP of Korea, the research compares the additional taxes and finances that are essential for social welfare. The results show that 1247 trillion won is needed for the next 20 years.

Although the source of competitiveness in the cultural industry comes from ensuring unlimited creativity and initiative in the private sector, government support is essential for the survival and development of the industry. Therefore, the desirable basis of cultural industry policy needs to be appropriately harmonized and balanced between the autonomy of the private sector and government support. Since the civilian government, Korea has been pursuing the policy direction of civilian autonomy and state support scheme. However it has yet to be institutionalized, causingmuch confusion. The study assessed cultural industry policies attempted by the previous governments in light of the model of historical institutionalismtransformation and analysed the reasons why the transformation of the policy direction ‘fromGovernment to Governance’ could not be institutionalized. The recent manipulation of state affairs by civilians over cultural industry policies is a clear example of this confusion. The conclusions obtained fromthis are as follows: In order for Korea to institutionalize its 'Arm’s length principle' policy stance, the nation must first restore its autonomy. ‘Power sharing’ to the private sector of a nation means the nation’s ability to coordinate itself strongly, not to weaken it. The relationship between the nation and the private sector could be a ‘positive sum’ rather than a 'zero-sum'."

These reforms brought the significant policy changes to their social welfare systems, particularly transforming their health care to be more inclusive and equitable. Although most past literature on health reforms prefers explaining the process with either institutional analysis or policy process model, both approaches capture mainly the roles and interactions among involved actors, ignoring the contextual factors propelling such reforms, not to mention the inclination to focus on similarities in existing comparative studies. Therefore, this study adopted the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) to explain how the policy changes happening in these two countries in the wake of financial crisis, aiming at highlighting some differences in the process that resulted in different outputs and outcomes. The findings showed that although the ACF is applicable to explain the process of health policy reforms in cases of Korea and Thailand, it is not sufficient to elucidate the policy process under the policy subsystems: different combinations of advocacy coalitions and reform opponents that truly determined the intensity of policy reform in both countries."

Functional groups, such as triplenylamine linked with phenylcarbazole or biphenyl, were employed in the chemical structure of the hole transport layer in order to maintain high triplet energy properties. When phenylcarbazole or biphenyl compounds continuously react with triphenylamine under acid catalysis, a chemically stable thin film material with desirable energy-level properties for a blue OLED could be obtained. The prepared hole transport materials showed excellent surface roughness and thermal stability in comparison with the commercial reference material. On the solution-processed model hole transport layer, we fabricated a device with a blue phosphorescent OLED by using sequential vacuum deposition. The maximum external quantum, 19.3%, was improved by more than 40% over devices with the commercial reference material (11.4%)."

Traditional terrorists are still active but at the same time a new breed of terrorists called violent extremists has been more and more visible. Violent extremists means individuals who are on the process of transforming rather than who have a certain identity or an essence. Such process is made of radicalization and extremism. Radicalization is a process of pathway and extremism is a final destination of such process or pathway. This article investigates causal factors or pathways affecting on the formation of violent extremists. It uses life-course theory as a theoretical framework. An individual’s process of violent radicalization is an outcome of accumulated effects of a series of factors. Such accumulated effects appear and evolve along an individual’s life-course. Qualitative analysis results of this study empirically show such integrated accumulated effects. Psychological and personal, strain or stress, social bonding, social learning, and opportunistic and situational factors in each step are all interrelated and produce complex causal factors.

Based on the current status of the logistics industry and the general industrial structure, several concerns about the development of the logistics industry and other industries have been addressed in this paper. A qualitative analysis between the logistics industry and industrial structure has been presented. Furthermore, the development of the logistics industry was quantified with the regional entropy coefficient. A linear regression model of the regional entropy coefficient and other industries data was established to analyze the correlation between logistics and the industrial structure. Then, the gray correlation was analyzed to further verify the correlation degree. The correlation degrees between logistics and industries in Pizhou were (sorted from high to low): primary industry, tertiary industry, and secondary industry. Combining development issues and the obtained correlation, several feasible suggestions are presented that promote the logistics industry on a county scale."

The Mycotoxin Zearalenone Hinders Candida albicans Biofilm Formation and Hyphal Morphogenesis,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Yeast-mold mycobiota inhabit several natural ecosystems, in which symbiotic relationships drive strategic pathoadaptation. Mycotoxins are metabolites produced by diverse mycotoxigenic fungi as a defense against yeasts, though at times yeasts secrete enzymes that degrade, detoxify, or bio-transform mycotoxins. The present study is focused on the in vitro inhibitory effects of zearalenone (ZEN), a F2 mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium and Gibberella species, on different microbial strains. ZEN exhibited no effect on the planktonic growth or biofilms of several Gram positive and negative bacteria at the tested concentrations. Remarkably, Candida albicans biofilm formation and hyphal morphogenesis were significantly inhibited when treated with 100 A mu g/mL of ZEN. Likewise, ZEN proficiently disrupted pre-formed C. albicans biofilms without disturbing planktonic cells. Furthermore, these inhibitions were confirmed by crystal violet staining and XTT reduction assays and by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. In an in vivo model, ZEN significantly suppressed C. albicans infection in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The study reports the in vitro antibiofilm efficacy of ZEN against C. albicans strains, and suggests mycotoxigenic fungi participate in asymmetric competitive interactions, such as, amensalism or antibiosis, rather than commensal interactions with C. albicans, whereby mycotoxins secreted by fungi destroy C. albicans biofilms.</P>"
Maximum Weight Matching Using Odd-Sized Cycles: Max-Product Belief Propagation and Half-Integrality,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>We study the maximum weight matching (MWM) problem for general graphs through the max-product belief propagation (BP) and related Linear Programming (LP). The BP approach provides distributed heuristics for finding the maximum <I>a posteriori</I> (MAP) assignment in a joint probability distribution represented by a graphical model (GM), and respective LPs can be considered as continuous relaxations of the discrete MAP problem. It was recently shown that a BP algorithm converges to the correct MAP/MWM assignment under a simple GM formulation of MWM, as long as the corresponding LP relaxation is tight. First, under the motivation for forcing the tightness condition, we consider a new GM formulation of MWM, say C-GM, using non-intersecting odd-sized cycles in the graph; the new corresponding LP relaxation, say C-LP, becomes tight for more MWM instances. However, the tightness of C-LP now does not guarantee such convergence and correctness of the new BP on C-GM. To address the issue, we introduce a novel graph transformation applied to C-GM, which results in another GM formulation of MWM, and prove that the respective BP on it converges to the correct MAP/MWM assignment, as long as C-LP is tight. Finally, we also show that C-LP always has half-integral solutions, which leads to an efficient BP-based MWM heuristic consisting of making sequential, “cutting plane”, modifications to the underlying GM. Our experiments show that this BP-based cutting plane heuristic performs, as well as that based on traditional LP solvers.</P>"

The values of the air gap magnetic density, torque and losses of the generator under various conditions are calculated using the finite element method. Taking the rated condition as a reference, the influence of the harmonic currents on the magnetic flux density is analyzed. It is confirmed that the time harmonic is a key factor affecting the generator performance. At the same time, the effects of harmonic currents on the torque ripple, average torque and eddy current loss of the generator are studied, and the mechanism of the variation of the eddy current loss is also discussed."

On the other hand, there is no typical method available that can be used to simulate the speckle component. We first review Watt’s method, wherein the speckle is simulated starting from the Doppler spectrum of the received echoes that is modeled as having a Gaussian shape. Then, we introduce a newly proposed method.

Improvement of Anti-wrinkle Properties of Cotton Fabrics Treated with Additives of Neutral Salts,2018,"['Anti-wrinkle finish', 'BTCA', 'Additives', 'Neutral salts', 'Adsorption']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"By employing 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) as the finishing agent, SHP as the catalyst and neutral salts NaCl and Na2SO4 as the additives, anti-wrinkle finish of cotton fabrics was carried out here. According to the Donnan equilibrium model and the actions of neutral salts in dyeing process of cellulosic fabrics, NaCl and Na2SO4 should both promote the adsorption of BTCA anions onto the surface of fibers and diffusion into the interior of fibers. Consequently, BTCA would crosslink the interior molecular chains of cellulose, improving the anti-wrinkle properties of treated fabrics. In fact, experimental results confirmed the hypothesis that the two additives of neutral salts indeed both improved wrinkle recovery angle (WRA) of the treated fabrics and the optimal molar ratio of NaCl or Na2SO4 to BTCA was 0.2:1 or 0.3:1, respectively. The neutral salts reduced the dosage of BTCA without decreasing WRA, reducing the manufacturing cost. Besides, the fabrics treated with neutral salts presented good durability. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Xray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses revealed that neutral salts could catalyze the formation of BTCA anhydride by decreasing hydrogen-bond interactions between BTCA molecules."

Then simple PI controllers are applied to achieve zero steady-state error of the controllers. The proposed control algorithm are modeled and simulated with imbalance load configuration to verify its performance. The simulation results show that the maximum PV power is transferred to the grid and the imbalance power is compensated successfully by the proposed control algorithm. The inverter has a fast response (~4 cycles) during the transient period. The proposed control algorithm can be effectively utilized to the three-phase four-wire inverter with imbalance load compensation function."

The chitosan-based adsorbents were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method and thermogravimetric analysis. Kinetic studies revealed that As(V) uptake using CCB, CCK and CCS fitted well with the pseudo-second order equation (<I>R<SUP>2</SUP></I> ≥ 0.9847; <I>RMSE</I> ≤ 9.1833). Equilibrium data show good correlation with the Langmuir model (<I>R<SUP>2</SUP></I> ≥ 0.9753; <I>RMSE</I> ≤ 8.5123; <I>SSE</I> ≤ 16.2651) for all adsorbents, which implies monolayer coverage onto homogenous energy sites. The Langmuir adsorption capacity for As(V) at pH 7.0 was determined to be 67.11, 64.85, and 16.78 mg/g for CCB, CCK and CCS, respectively. Thermodynamic studies show that As(V) uptake is exothermic in nature using CCK and endothermic using CCB and CCS. Moreover, adsorption of As(V) was feasible and spontaneous for CCB and CCS at 298 to 328 K. Results show that CCB is the most effective adsorbent in the removal of As(V) from water due to its high surface area and large pore diameter.</P>"

The drug release rate of methimazole, a freely soluble model drug, was evaluated extensively together with the mechanical strength and true density of the coated pellets. Moreover, the thermal and spectroscopic properties, as well as the surface characteristics were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Drug layering and EC coating of the pellets were performed in a fluid bed granulator. The results of thermal and infrared analyses showed the absence of significant interactions between the drug and the EC. The regression model was developed to predict the dependent variables (drug release at time 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h, hardness of coated pellet, and true density). The results showed that the degree of coating and curing had the most significant effects on all response variables. The design space was built in accordance with the drug release rate following failure probability analysis using Monte Carlo simulations. Robustness and accuracy were also successfully validated and the control variables were optimized.

Results revealed that, among the four sorption isotherm models, Langmuir model showed the best fit to describe As(III) and As(V) sorption on OW-BC, with slightly greater sorption affinity for As(V) compared to As(III) (<I>Q<SUB>L</SUB> </I> =3.89 and 3.16mgg<SUP>−1</SUP>; R<SUP>2</SUP> =0.91 and 0.85, respectively). Sorption edge experiments indicated that the maximum As removal was 81% and 84% for As(III)- and As(V)-OW-BC systems at pH7 and 6, respectively, which decreased above these pH values (76–69% and 80–58%). Surface functional groups, notably OH, COOH, CO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>, were involved in As sequestration by OW-BC, suggesting the surface complexation/precipitation and/or electrostatic interaction of As on OW-BC surface. Arsenic K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy indicated that 36% of the added As(III) was partially oxidized to As(V) in the As(III) sorption experiment, and in As(V) sorption experiment, 48% of As(V) was, albeit incompletely, reduced to As(III) on OW-BC surface. Application of OW-BC to As-contaminated well water (As: 27–144μgL<SUP>−1</SUP>; <I>n</I> =10) displayed that 92 to 100% of As was depleted despite in the presence of co-occurring competing anions (e.g., SO<SUB>4</SUB> <SUP>2−</SUP>, CO<SUB>3</SUB> <SUP>2−</SUP>, PO<SUB>4</SUB> <SUP>3−</SUP>).

Serum Albumin Modulates the Bioactivity of Rosmarinic Acid,2018,"['acetylcholinesterase', 'antioxidant activity', 'FTIR', 'protein secondary structure', 'SDS-PAGE']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a phenolic compound with biological activity. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether this compound kept its biological activity in the presence of proteins. For this purpose, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a model protein, and the capacity of the RA to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and affect antioxidant activity was evaluated in the absence and presence of BSA. A mixture of phenolic compounds containing RA, obtained from a medicinal plant was added to this study. The AChE inhibitory activity of RA was reduced by ∼57% in the presence of BSA, while the antioxidant activity increased. These results lead to the investigation of the effect of RA on the BSA structure using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). At 37°C and higher temperatures, RA caused a decrease in the temperature modifications on the protein structure. Furthermore, FTIR and native-gel analysis revealed that protein aggregation/precipitation, induced by temperature, was reduced in the presence of RA. The novelty of the present work resides in the study of the enzyme inhibitory activity and antioxidant capacity of polyphenols, such as RA, in the presence of a protein. The findings highlight the need to consider the presence of proteins when assessing biological activities of polyphenols in vitro and that enzyme inhibitory activity may be decreased, while the antioxidant capacity remains or even increases."

Lactobacillus rhamnosus RW-9595M and ATCC 9595 have 99% identical operons coding for EPS biosynthesis, produced different amounts of EPS (543 vs 108 mg/l). L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 transformed with the operons from RW-9595M and ATCC 9595 respectively, produced 326 and 302 mg/l EPS in M17 containing 0.5% glucose. The tyrosine protein kinase transmembrane modulator (Wzd) was proposed to participate in regulating chain elongation of EPS polymers by interacting with the tyrosine protein kinase Wze. While Wzd was found in phosphorylated form in the presence of the phosphorylated kinase (Wze), no phosphorylated proteins were detected when all nine tyrosines of Wzd were mutated to phenylalanine. Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris could produce higher amounts of EPS than other EPS-producing lactococci when expressing genes from L. rhamnosus. Phosphorylated Wzd was essential for the phosphorylation of Wze when expressed in vivo."
Aqyn agha? Abai Zholy as socialist realism and as literary history,2018,"['Kazakh literary history', 'socialist realism', 'oral literature', 'Abai Zholy', 'Zar Zaman']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In Mukhtar Auezov's 1942 novel Abai Zholy, socialism is an end anticipated not just by history but more specifically by Kazakh literary history. In his earlier scholarly writings, Auezov had presented Abai as a transformational figure in the emergence of written Kazakh literature. In the novel, Abai becomes not only a literary innovator but also a political reformist: Auezov's Abai is horrified by the harsh and feudalistic behavior of his father Qunanbai, a wealthy local leader, and finds companionship and inspiration in his encounters with a series of famous 19th century Kazakh aqyns (bards). Auezov thus used Abai Zholy to argue that Kazakh folk literature had always been animated by a spirit of social critique which, in its laments and desires, had anticipated the Soviet world. This paper compares these aqyns' depiction in the novel first with Auezov's earlier scholarship on the 19th century and second with the content of the aqyns' own surviving works. These ideas reflected both contemporaneous shifts in Soviet nationalities policy and the influence of socialist realist literary models, which commonly staged both literary history and generational conflicts as allegories of political change."

A series of aerogels were prepared by adjusting the mass ratios of CE and CS. Composite aerogels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). SEM images showed that it was possible to change the structure of the aerogel by adjusting the amount of chitosan. The effects of dosage of chitosan, initial pH, temperature, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and initial dye concentration on adsorption capacities for CR were studied in detail. Batch adsorption studies showed that aerogel exhibited maximum removal efficiency to CR at a composite ratio of 1:3 and dosage of 2.5 g/l. CE/CS aerogel had excellent adsorption capacities for CR at a pH range of 3-11, which indicated stability of the aerogel in both acidic and alkaline conditions. CR adsorption on the composite aerogel fitted pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm. The Langmuir isotherm model revealed that the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity of this material for CR was 381.7 mg/g at pH 7.0 at 303 K for 24 h. The adsorption mechanism included electrostatic and chemical interactions. The results indicated that the adsorption capacity of CE/CS aerogels was higher than the other chitosan composites adsorbents."

In this study, Laponite (LAP) nanodisks were first used to encapsulate a model antibiotic drug, tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH). Then, drug-loaded LAP nanodisks with an optimized loading efficiency (85.3 %) were mixed with poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) polymer to form drug-loaded composite porous membrane via solvent coasting. The structure, morphology and swelling property of the porous membranes formed with varied solvent ratio of methylene dichloride (DCM) and dimethyl formamide (DMF) in the mixture solvent were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and swelling test. In vitro drug release behavior, the cytotoxicity and the antibacterial activity of drug-loaded composite membranes were evaluated. Results showed that the TCH release was dependent on the physical structure of PLLA membrane and the presence of LAP nanodisks effectively weakened the initial burst release of TCH, and improved the sustained release property of porous PLLA membrane. The released TCH of TCH/LAP/PLLA3:1 and TCH/LAP/PLLA4:1 was 10.0 % and 5.3 % within initial 1 h, respectively. More importantly, the porous TCH/LAP/PLLA membrane was cytocompatible and displayed considerable antibacterial activity, solely associated with the loaded TCH drug, confirming its potential utility in wound dressings and tissue engineering."

Wet cupping is by far the most common type of cupping therapy. Hijamah in Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries is a model of religious influences, interconnectivity, and cross-cultural influences between different civilizations. Accordingly, differentiating the cupping practiced in Saudi Arabia, and other Muslims societies from that practiced in other countries like China, by Korea only by the technique or cupping sites is an underestimation of the differences. In Saudi Arabia, the profile or characteristics of cupping therapy user is distinct from the profile of other traditional medicine users by being more educated, with higher job rank and not affected by nationality or gender. After an era of unregulated practice, cupping therapy is currently regulated and monitored by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the Ministry of Health (NCCAM/MOH) of Saudi Arabia. Regulations and licensing include practitioners, practice place, and cupping equipment. After regulation, cupping is mainly offered by the private sector and paid directly by the client as insurance does not cover it. In the private sector, licensed cupping service is usually provided as a parallel and not an integrated service.

This method involves transposing the discipline of mathematics into a special kind of mathematics for students, or vice versa where students mathematize the contexts and engage in learning mathematics. Alternatively, traditional teaching models involve the transfer of mathematical knowledge held by the teacher to the students who are recipients of the knowledge. A scholarly approach of teachers and researchers teaching these two different methods merits a detailed examination. In light of this need, this study investigates two teachers’ experiences of the use and implementation of both an RME approach and a traditional teaching method with the same instructional goal of solving quadratic optimization problems. The findings of this study suggest that various forms and transformations of the knowledge of the Didactic Transposition theory emerged as an important area in the design and implementation of a mathematics lesson. In particular, the RME approach afforded students with diverse backgrounds rich opportunities to engage in mathematics and produce productive mindsets toward mathematics. Further, our findings illustrate how the teachers engaged in a professional discourse for the lesson analysis, and how they reflected on the ways that a teaching method could present challenges, barriers or opportunities in the classroom. We concluded that the implementation of two conflicting pedagogies could serve as a meaningful opportunity of learning, whereby teachers were able to connect the Didactic Transposition theory to practice, and reflect on the pedagogical realities of teaching school mathematics."

Fenazaquin was also rapidly transformed into the same metabolites (t1/2 = 0.1–0.5 day) under chemical oxidation (m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid). Among the several metabolic inhibitors, flavindependent mono-oxygenase inhibitor, methimazole yielded no inhibitory activity (t1/2 = 1.6 day). Several cytochrome P450 inhibitors including piperonyl butoxide, ketoconazole, and myclobutanil were also tested. Piperonyl butoxide strongly reduced fenazaquin metabolism (t1/2 = 58.7 days).However, ketoconazole and myclobutanil showed no activity even at fungi-toxic concentrations (t1/2 = 1.2–4.3 days) with major metabolites similar to those of control experiments.The results suggest that oxidative metabolism of fenazaquin was catalyzed by specific cytochrome P450s, which are insensitive to azole fungicides. In addition, piperonyl butoxide was found to be one of the most promising synergists of pesticides, through cytochrome P450 inhibition."
Therapeutic effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors on kidney disease,2018,"['Histone deacetylase inhibitors', 'Fibrosis', 'Inflammation', 'Renal cell carcinoma', 'TGF-β signaling pathway']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Increasing evidence has shown the involvementof histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the development andprogression of various renal diseases, highlighting itsinhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy to preventkidney diseases. Accordingly, numerous studies haveshown that HDAC inhibitors protect the kidneys fromvarious diseases through their effects on multiple pathways,such as suppression of transforming growth factor-βsignaling pathway and nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways,augmentation of apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis.To develop more effective and less toxic isoformselectiveHDAC inhibitors and further improve clinicaloutcomes, it is necessary to identify and understand themechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progressionof renal diseases.

Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization of Multishelled Cationic Corona for the Systemic Delivery of siRNA,2018,"['Gold nanoparticle', 'siRNA', 'surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization', 'anticancer therapy']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>We propose an effective siRNA delivery system by preparing poly(DAMA-HEMA)-multilayered gold nanoparticles using multiple surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization processes. The polymeric multilayer structure is characterized by transmission electron microscopy, matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and ζ-potential. The amount of siRNA electrostatically incorporated into the nanoparticle can be tuned by the number of polymeric shells, which in turn influences the cellular uptake and gene silencing effect. In a bioreductive environment, the interlayer disulfide bond breaks to release the siRNA from the degraded polymeric shells. Intravenously injected c-Myc siRNA-incorporated particles accumulate in the tumor site of a murine lung carcinoma model and significantly suppress the tumor growth. Therefore, the combination of a size-tunable AuNP core and an ATRP-functionalized shell offers control and versatility in the effective delivery of siRNA.</P>[FIG OMISSION]</BR>"
폐기물처리방법별 환경효율성(Eco-efficiency) 평가 연구,2018,"['환경효율성 평가', '전과정평가', '환경성 평가', '경제성 평가', '폐기물처리시설', 'Environmental Efficiency Evaluation', 'Life-cycle Assessment', 'Economic Performance Assessment', 'Waste Treatment Facility']","2018년 「자원순환기본법」을 시행하면서 우리나라에서는 자원순환사회로 전환하기 위해 국가 중장기 정책방향과 세부전략을 담은 국가 『자원순환기본계획(2018-2027)』을 수립하였다. 그동안 주로 행해 왔던 단순 재활용에서 고부가가치를 생산하는 물질 재활용으로 변화할 필요성이 대두되는 가운데, 우리나라에서는 『자원순환기본계획(2018-2027)』을 통해 2027년 최종처분율 3%와 더 나아가 직매립의 제로화 달성을 목표로 삼고 있다. 이에 폐기물처리시설의 환경효율적인 측면을 검토할 필요성이 발생함에 따라, 본 연구에서는 폐기물처리시설의 경제성 및 환경성을 분석하여 이를 통합한 폐기물처리방법별 환경효율성을 평가하고 이를 바탕으로 정책적 활용방안을 제시하였다. 생활폐기물 공공 처리시설을 대상으로 분석하였으며, 이를 위해 폐기물의 유형을 크게 가연성폐기물(종량제봉투 폐기물)과 유기성폐기물(음식물류폐기물)로 나누어 검토하였다. 국내 제도상 생활폐기물 중 음식물류폐기물은 직매립이 금지되고 별도 종량제로 운영되어 처리물량 대부분이 재활용되고 있으며, 매립되거나 소각되는 물량은 각각 1.0%, 2.2% 수준이다. 이에 가연성폐기물의 처리방법간 비교와 음식물류폐기물의 처리방법 간 비교를 통해 효율적인 처리방안을 검토하였다.환경효율성 평가에서는 시설의 수익에서 운영비를 제외한 톤당 비용을 경제성 지표로 설정하였으며, 환경성 지표의 경우 시설에 대해 전과정평가(LCA)를 수행하여 톤당 발생하는 가중화 환경영향으로 설정하였다. 환경효율성을 평가할 때 소각여열 이용, 바이오가스판매 등에 의해서 발생하는 회피효과가 경제성 평가에서 중복 반영되는 것을 막기 위해 환경성에서는 이를 제외하였다.평가대상인 시설은 폐기물처리방법별로 지역, 규모, 처리유형 등을 고려하여 선정하였다. 특히 「2016년 폐기물처리시설 설치·운영실태평가」에서 우수시설로 평가된 시설과 그렇지 않은 시설이 포함되도록 처리방법별로 5개 그룹(종량제봉투 폐기물: 소각시설, 가연성폐기물 연료화시설, 매립시설; 음식물류폐기물: 유기성폐기물 바이오가스화시설, 음식물류폐기물 자원화시설)의 79개 시설을 대상으로 선정하고, 각 시설에서 제출한 데이터와 평가결과의 신뢰도를 고려하여 42개 시설의 환경성 및 경제성을 분석하였다. 시설 규모는 100톤/일 미만의 소형시설, 100톤/일 이상~300톤/일 미만의 중형시설, 300톤/일 이상의 대형시설로 구분하였다. 특히 세부시설 유형은 음식물류폐기물 자원화시설의 경우 자원화 방식별로 감량화, 사료화, 퇴비화 시설로 구분하여 선정하였으며, 매립시설의 경우 불연물 매립시설과 일반 매립시설로 구분하여 선정하였다. 환경성·경제성 분석을 위해서는 시설별로 폐기물반입량, 에너지 사용량, 소각여열 이용량, 매립가스 포집량, 바이오가스 생산량, 퇴비 및 사료 생산량과 운영비용, 시설수익 등의 자료를 이용하였다.폐기물처리방법별 환경성 분석결과, 매립시설의 가중화 환경영향이 4.42E-02포인트로 가장 작게 나타났으며, 뒤를 이어 유기성폐기물 바이오가스화시설(8.87E-02포인트), 음식물류폐기물 자원화시설(2.25E-01포인트), 소각시설(3.50E-01포인트), 가연성폐기물 연료화시설(1.39포인트) 순으로 나타났다. 경제성 분석에서는 시설 수익에서 운영비용을 제외한 비용을 기준으로 하였을 때 매립시설의 경제성이 731원/톤으로 가장 높게 나타났으며, 뒤를 이어 유기성폐기물 바이오가스화시설(-33,419원/톤), 음식물류폐기물 자원화시설(-40,172원/톤), 소각시설(-58,646원/톤), 가연성폐기물 연료화시설(-60,149원/톤) 순으로 나타났다.환경성·경제성 분석결과를 바탕으로 환경효율성을 평가한 결과, 매립시설의 환경효율성이 10,837천 원/포인트로 가장 좋게 나타났으며, 뒤를 이어 유기성폐기물 바이오가스화시설(4,760천 원/포인트), 음식물류폐기물 자원화시설(1,540천 원/포인트), 소각시설(760천원/포인트), 가연성폐기물 연료화시설(-184천 원/포인트) 순으로 나타났다.시설 규모에 따른 환경효율성을 평가한 결과, 소각시설의 경우 중형시설의 환경효율성이 2,108천 원/포인트로 가장 좋게 나타났으며 뒤를 이어 소형시설(834천 원/포인트), 대형시설(280천 원/포인트) 순으로 나타났다. 가연성폐기물 연료화시설의 경우 대형시설의 환경효율성이 5,306천 원/포인트로 가장 좋게 나타났으며 뒤를 이어 소형시설(-212천 원/포인트), 중형시설(-236천 원/포인트) 순으로 나타났다. 유기성폐기물 바이오가스화시설의 경우 대형시설의 환경효율성이 10,617천 원/포인트로 가장 좋게 나타났으며 뒤를 이어 중형시설(6,236천 원/포인트), 소형시설(2,859천 원/포인트) 순으로 나타났다. 음식물류폐기물자원화시설의 경우 중형시설의 환경효율성이 1,959천 원/포인트로 가장 좋게 나타났으며 소형시설(1,308천 원/포인트)이 뒤를 이었고, 대형시설은 평가대상에 포함되지 않았다. 매립시설의 경우 반입 폐기물의 성상에 따라 불연물 매립과 일반 매립으로 구분하여 환경효율성을 평가하였으며, 불연물 매립의 환경효율성이 18,957천 원/포인트로 일반 매립의 환경효율성 9,458천 원/포인트보다 높게 나타났다.환경효율성 평가결과를 바탕으로, 폐기물 처리 시나리오에 따른 2027년의 환경효율성믹스를 산정하여 현재의 환경효율성 믹스와 비교 분석하였다. 종량제봉투 폐기물의 경우2016년 에는 매립 31.1%, 소각 53.2%, 가연성연료화 15.6% 비율로 처리1)되던 것이 『제1차 자원순환기본계획』 목표연도인 2027년에는 매립 2.5%, 소각 33.5%, 가연성연료화23.5% 비율로 처리2)될 것으로 전망되었다. 음식물류폐기물의 경우 2016년에는 바이오가스화 10%, 음식물류폐기물자원화(사료화, 퇴비화 등) 90%였던 처리 비율이 2027년에는 바이오가스화 69.7%, 음식물자원화 30.3%가 될 것으로 전망되었다.산정결과, 매립시설 전체를 기준으로 하였을 때 환경효율성 믹스는 2016년 5,173천 원/포인트, 2027년 4,118천 원/포인트로 나타났다. 매립시설을 2016년에는 일반 매립, 2027년에는 불연물 매립으로 구분하여 가정하였을 때 환경효율성 믹스는 2016년 4,744천 원/포인트, 2027년 4,321천 원/포인트로 나타났다.또한 본 연구에서는 환경효율성 평가결과와 폐기물처리시설의 설치·운영 실태평가결과를 비교하였다. 그 결과, 소각시설의 경우 환경효율성 평가가 좋은 시설이 실태평가에서도 좋은 결과를 나타냈으나 약간의 차이를 보였다. 이는 실태평가에서는 소각열 회수율이 반영되었으나 환경효율성 평가의 환경성 분석에서는 제외되었고, 시설의 연료 사용에 대한 전과 정평가가 환경효율성에만 반영되었기 때문으로 보인다. 가연성폐기물 연료화시설에서도 실태평가결과와 환경효율성 평가결과가 대부분 일치하는 경향을 보였으며, 차이가 발생하는 이유는 SRF 생산율이 환경효율성 평가의 경제성에 크게 영향을 미치지 않기 때문인 것으로 판단된다.유기성폐기물 바이오가스화시설의 경우, 실태평가와 환경효율성 평가결과가 다소 일치하지 않는 경향을 보인다. 이는 실태평가에 반영된 악취관리, 가동률 및 시설관리 등의 지표가 환경효율성 평가에는 반영되지 않기 때문으로 판단된다.매립시설의 경우, 실태평가의 환경성 및 경제성 결과와 환경효율성 평가결과가 비슷한 경향을 보이는 것으로 나타났다. 차이가 발생하는 이유는 실태평가의 기술성 평가지표가 환경효율성 평가 지표와는 달리 다짐효율, 침출수 감량률 등을 반영하기 때문으로 보인다.본 연구에서는 연구결과를 기반으로 환경효율성 평가를 정책적으로 활용하는 방안을 마련하였다.폐기물처리방법별로 환경효율성 평가에 큰 영향을 미치는 요소를 분석하여 <표 4>에 나타냈으며, 이를 시설의 환경적·경제적 효율 개선을 위한 지표로 사용할 수 있다.또한 폐기물처리시설의 입지조건 또는 운영기준에 따라 경제적 지표에 활용되는 수익과 운영비용에서 큰 차이가 발생하기 때문에 폐기물처리시설 간 환경효율성을 단순 비교분석하는 것은 바람직하지 않을 수 있다. 따라서 환경효율성 평가는 동일 시설 간 비교나 특정시설의 개선효과를 파악 및 권고하는 데 활용하는 것이 바람직하다. 이에 본 연구에서는 폐기물처리시설별 환경효율성 향상을 위해 개선향상 비교계수, 벤치마크 비교계수, 용량설계기준 비교계수의 3가지 비교계수를 제시하였다.개선향상 비교계수는 특정 폐기물처리시설에 대하여 해당 시설의 경제적 비용 절감 효과또는 환경영향 효과 절감 노력 등의 시설개선 전후를 비교하는 데 활용할 수 있다. 벤치마킹비교계수는 비교 대상인 여러 시설 중 특정 시설의 환경효율성 결과가 나쁠 경우, 또는 최우수 시설과 비교를 통해 특정 시설의 개선이 필요할 경우에 개선을 통해 어느 정도의 효과를 거둘 수 있는지 비교하고, 해당 시설의 환경을 어느 수준까지 개선할 수 있는지 판단하는 기준이 될 수 있다. 용량 설계기준 비교계수의 경우, 신규 폐기물처리시설 건설 시 시설용량별 환경효율성의 가이드라인을 제시하여 시설의 과도한 운영비용 산정 이나 환경영향 발생의 예방 등에 활용할 수 있을 것이다.환경효율성이 높은 시설과 비교하여 환경효율성이 낮은 시설이 폐기물 자원화 생산품판매량의 향상을 통해서 환경효율성을 개선한다고 가정할 때, 개선향상 비교계수와 벤치마크 비교계수를 사례 연구로 산정하였다.소각시설의 비교분석은 4가지 유형(A, B, C, D)으로 나누고, 각 유형에 맞는 시설을 선정하여 수행하였다. A유형은 시설운영비 및 환경성 평가결과가 비슷한 시설과 비교하여 에너지 회수를 개선(경제적 가치)하는 사례(아산 소각시설 대비 하남 소각시설의 수준으로 열에너지 회수 수준 개선)이며, B유형은 시설운영비는 유사하고 환경성 평가결과는 우수한 시설과 비교하여 에너지 회수를 개선(경제적 가치)하는 사례(구미 소각시설 대비 하남 소각시설의 수준으로 열에너지 회수 수준 개선)이다. C유형은 시설운영비가 높은 시설에 대해 환경성 평가결과가 비슷한 시설과 비교하여 에너지 회수를 개선(경제적 가치)하는 사례(아산소각시설 대비 세종 소각시설의 수준으로 열에너지 회수 수준 개선)이다. D유형은 시설운영비가 높은 시설에 대해 환경성 평가결과가 우수한 시설과 비교하여 에너지 회수를 개선(경제적 가치)하는 사례(구미 소각시설 대비 세종 소각시설의 수준으로 열에너지 회수 수준개선)이다.바이오가스화시설은 시설 유형 선정에 한계가 있어 B와 D 유형 2가지에 맞는 시설만 선정하였다. B유형은 시설운영비는 유사하고 환경성 평가결과는 우수한 시설과 비교하여 폐기물 자원화 생산을 개선하는 사례(남양주 시설 대비 김해 시설의 수준으로 바이오가스생산 수준 개선)이며, D유형은 시설운영비가 높은 시설에 대해 폐기물 자원화 생산을 개선하는 사례(남양주 시설 대비 아산 시설의 수준으로 운영비 수준 개선)이다.하남 소각시설의 소각열 회수량을 50% 개선했을 때 개선향상 비교계수는 1.04이며, A유형의 경우 벤치마크 비교계수는 0.56, B유형의 경우에는 0.147로 나타났다. 세종 소각시설의 소각열 회수량을 50% 개선했을 때 개선향상 비교계수는 1.03이며, C유형의 벤치마크계수는 0.98, D유형의 경우에는 0.26으로 나타났다. 남양주 바이오가스화시설의 바이오가스생산량을 35% 개선했을 때 개선향상 비교계수는 1.02이며, B유형의 경우 벤치마크 비교계수는 0.22, D유형의 경우에는 0.40으로 나타났다.용량 설계기준 비교계수를 산정하기 위해서 처리시설별 규모에 따른 환경효율성 평균을 계산하여 환경효율성이 가장 좋은 시설규모를 기준으로 다른 시설과 비교하였다. 평가결과 소형 소각시설의 용량 설계기준 비교계수는 0.40으로 대형 소각시설에 비해 좋은 것으로 나타났으며, 바이오가스화시설의 경우 중형시설의 용량 설계기준 비교계수가 0.59로 소형바이오가스화시설에 비해 우수한 것으로 분석되었다.환경효율성 평가의 정책적 활용방안으로는 1) 폐기물처리시설 설치·운영실태평가 및 노후시설 개선 시 환경효율성 평가 활용방안, 2) 전략환경영향평가 및 예비타당성 조사, 3) 주민지원사업과 처분부담금의 사회적 비용 산정 시 환경효율성 평가 활용방안, 4) 최적화 전략추진 및 국고보조사업 추진 시 환경효율성 평가 활용방안을 제시하였다.환경효율성 평가를 폐기물처리시설 설치·운영 실태평가에 적용하여 매년 운영 실태를 평가하고 에너지 활용 및 회수, 효율적 운영방안을 제안할 수 있다. 현재 실태평가에서는 폐기물처리시설의 경제성 개선 노력도와 지자체의 폐기물 감량률 등 개선 노력도를 평가하고 있으나, 환경성과 경제성을 모두 고려한 개선 노력도는 평가하지 않는다. 따라서 폐기물처리시설의 운영 개선 노력을 평가하기 위해 제6장 제2절에서 제시한 환경효율성 비교계수를 적용할 필요가 있다. 또한 처리시설의 노후도 조사결과에 따라 환경효율성 비교계수를 적용하여 노후시설의 개선 및 폐쇄 여부, 신규시설 설치 여부 등을 고려할 수 있을 것이다.「폐기물처리시설 설치촉진 및 주변지역지원 등에 관한 법률」에 따라 폐기물처리시설을 설치·운영할 시 설치비용과 입지선정계획 등을 결정해야 하며, 이를 위해 환경부에서는 전략환경영향평가를 시행하는 동시에 정책계획과 개발기본계획으로 나누어 검토하고 있다. 현재 전략환경영향평가의 조사항목에는 폐기물처리시설의 처리규모 및 처리방법, 반입 폐기물의 성상과 관련한 환경성 평가와 처리비용 및 수익에 관한 경제성 평가가 수반되고 있지 않다. 따라서 본 연구의 환경효율성 평가를 조사항목에 포함하여 처리시설의 종류와 규모, 입지선정 시의 적합성을 고려할 필요가 있다. 또한 환경시설에 대한 예비타당성 조사시 환경비용은 관련 문헌이나 전문가 조사에 따른 추정비용으로 산출되는 경우가 많아서 논란의 소지가 될 가능성이 있다. 따라서 본 연구에서 제시한 환경효율성 평가방법은 실제 시설에서 측정한 자료를 바탕으로 경제적·환경적 효과를 제시하므로 좋은 활용 지표가 될 수 있을 것으로 사료된다.또한 주민지원사업과 처분부담금의 사회적 비용 산정 시에도 환경효율성 평가를 활용할 수 있을 것으로 판단된다. 본 연구결과 매립시설의 환경성 평가결과와 경제성 평가결과가 다른 종류의 시설보다 우수하게 나타났는데, 이는 사회적으로 매립시설에 대한 운영부담을 그만큼 적게 주었기 때문으로 사료된다. 그러므로 매립시설의 환경효율성 평가 시범사업을 실시하여 환경오염 배출 방지를 위한 사회적 비용과 환경영향을 추가로 규명해야 하며, 특히 매립시설을 위한 토지확보 비용의 경우 측정하기 어렵기 때문에 경제성 평가 시 직접 비용과 간접 영향(지가하락 등)을 고려한 비용을 모두 반영해야 한다. 본 연구결과에서 소각시설과 비교하여 매립시설의 사회적 비용을 예측한 결과, 일반 매립시설의 경제적 가치는-368,703원/톤으로 나타났다. 현재 평가대상 매립시설의 평균 처리비용은 14,956원/톤이므로 톤당 약 34만 원 정도를 추가로 반영하여 매립처분부담금을 높일 필요성이 있다고 판단된다.폐기물처리시설 국고보조사업의 목적은 지역별 폐기물처리시설 설치사업에 대한 지원기준, 우선순위 등을 명확히 하여 체계적인 국고지원 및 시설투자를 유도하는 것 이다다. 현재국고보조를 위한 시설 설치비 표준단가는 시설별·용량별 기준으로 제시되는데, 시설 용량이 적을수록 사업비 표준단가가 높게 책정되며 이 표준단가에 따라 비율대로 국고지원이 이루어진다. 본 연구에 따르면 소형시설의 경우 다른 규모의 시설보다 환경효율성이 낮게 나타났으며, 국고보조사업의 지원 비율에 따라 더 높은 국고보조를 받는 것으로 나타났다. 따라서 최적 시설용량에 따라 국비지원을 차등 적용하는 것에 대한 개정이 필요하며, 이는 국가정책방향에 부합하는 폐기물처리시설의 광역화·직접화 처리시설에 대한 투자추진 근거가 될 수 있다. 또한 「폐기물처리시설 국고보조금 예산지원 및 통합업무처리지침(2018.1)」, 「폐기물처리시설 최적화 전략(2011)」, 「환경기술 및 환경산업 지원법」 등에 의해 시설의 예산을 신청하거나 국비를 지원하는 경우에도 환경효율성 평가 활용을 검토할 수 있다.마지막으로 환경효율성 평가 활용에 따라 기대 효과는 다음과 같다. 첫 번째, 폐기물의 자원화에 대한 환경·경제적 통합평가를 통해 처리방법별 정책적 추진방향의 근거를 제시하여 『제1차 자원순환기본계획(2018-2027)』 목표에 따른 자원순환 전략 수행에 기여할 수 있다. 두 번째, 단순 오염부하를 기준으로 평가하는 환경성 평가 개념에서 환경·경제적 효율성 평가로 연결되는 패러다임을 확산할 수 있다. 세 번째, 폐기물처리시설에 대한 평가 모델을 구축하여 친환경적인 평가 개념 도입함으로써 폐기물 처리에 대한 국민의 이미지를 제고 할 수 있다. 네 번째, 환경영향 및 부하관리를 효율화하는 방안을 마련하여 환경오염을 사전에 예방하고 경제효율화를 감안한 기술개발을 유도하여 에코이노베이션과 연계할 수 있다.또한 본 연구의 환경효율성 평가결과는 폐기물처리시설 간, 처리방법 간의 단순 비교보다는 시설 개선 및 효율화를 위한 방법론으로서의 활용도에 더 의미를 부여할 수 있을 것이며, 특히 환경효율성 산정 방법론의 주요 요소인 시설의 처리비용, 수익, 환경부하 중에서 환경효율성에 가장 큰 영향을 주는 요인을 분석하여 시설별 개선 및 효율화에 활용할 수 있을 것이다. 환경효율성 평가가 국고보조사업, 환경영향평가 등에 도입된다면 시범사업 실시를 통해 시설별 데이터의 신뢰도가 높아지는 것은 물론이고 환경효율성의 활용도 또한 높아질 것이다.폐기물처리시설에서는 심미적 또는 건강과 관련하여 환경영향을 미치는 악취와 같은 오염물질이 발생하는 경우가 있다. 이에 악취방지시설과 같은 방지시설을 도입하면 악취 개선효과 등은 본 연구의 평가항목이 아니므로 반영되지 않는 반면에, 시설의 운영비가 증가하여 환경효율성이 떨어지는 경우가 발생할 수 있다. 따라서 추가 연구와 시범사업을 실시하여 시설의 특성을 반영한 평가항목 및 방법론을 적용하는 방향으로 개선을 모색할 필요가 있다. 그리고 본 연구에서는 환경효율성 산정에 있어 음수(-)인 지수를 양수(+)화하는 과정에서 경제성 지표의 수치이동, 환경성 평가에서 회피효과는 제외하였으므로 폐기물처리시설 특성상 경제적 가치와 환경부하가 음수로 발생하는 사례의 연구를 추가로 수행하고 국제적으로 논의 할 필요가 있다.","In conjunction with the ""Basic Law on Resource Circulation"" in 2018, Korea established the Basic Plan for National Resource Recirculation (2018-2027), which contains the nation’s mid-to-long term policy directions and detailed strategies to transform into a resource circulating society. The new directive places greater importance in changing Korea’s recycling system from simple recycling to high value-adding material recycling, with the national goal to realize a final disposal rate of 3% by 2027 and zero waste-to-landfill. In this context, this study conducts the much-needed review on the environmental efficiency of Korea’s waste treatment facilities by analyzing their economic and environmental performances. Based on this review, the overall environmental efficiency of each waste treatment method is assessed to propose policies for the effective utilization of the facilities.The wastes were analyzed in terms of combustible waste (disposed in volume-rate waste bags) and organic waste (food waste). Under Korea’s regulations, among municipal/household wastes, food waste is not sent directly to landfills. Instead, a separate volume-rate system is in place for food waste so that most of the food waste is recycled, with only 1.0% and 2.2% sent to landfills or incinerated, respectively. Thus, the different treatment methods for combustible waste and food waste were examined to find the most efficient treatment methods for the respective wastes. Economic performance was evaluated using the treatment facility’s revenue per treating one ton of waste minus the operational costs as the indicator, and environmental performance was determined by conducting a life-cycle assessment (LCA) for calculating the weighted environmental impact per one ton of waste. In assessing the environmental performance, the avoidance effects from utilizing recovered incineration heat and selling the biogas produced from organic waste were excluded to prevent an overlap with the economic performance.The facilities subject to the environmental efficiency evaluation were chosen based on their location, size, treatment method, etc. for each waste disposal method. In particular, to ensure a good mix of the facilities that received high scores and those that did not in the “2016 Evaluation of the Installation and Operation of Waste Treatment Facilities (hereafter 2016 Evaluation),” the facilities were divided into five groups (for waste disposed in volume-rate waste bags: incineration facilities, combustible waste-to-fuel facilities, landfills; for food waste: organic waste biogasification facilities, food waste recycling facilities). 79 facilities were initially chosen, from which 42 facilities were finally selected and analyzed for their environmental and economic performances based on the data submitted by the facilities and the reliability of the evaluation results.The chosen facilities were divided according to their sizes, into small facilities that treat less than 100 tons per day, medium facilities that treat more than 100 tons but less than 300 tons per day, and large facilities that treat more than 300 tons per day. Different facility types were incorporated into the analysis, such as facilities for reducing food waste, converting food waste into animal feed and compost were included under food waste recycling facilities; and landfills for incombustible waste and general waste under landfills. The environmental and economic performance analyses were conducted using the following data from each treatment facility: the amounts of waste sent to the facility, energy use, incineration heat recovery, captured landfill gas, biogas production, and compost and feed production, as well as operational costs and operational revenue, etc.The environmental performance analysis by waste treatment method showed that the weighted environmental impact of landfills was the smallest at 4.42E-02 points, followed by organic waste biogasification facilities (8.87E-02 points), food waste recycling facilities (2.25E-01 points), incineration facilities (3.50E-01 points), and combustible waste-to-fuel facilities (1.39 points). On the other hand, the economic performance analysis based on each facility’s revenue minus operational costs revealed that the economic performance of landfills performed best at 731 won/ton, followed by organic waste biogasification facilities (-33,419 won/ton), food waste recycling facilities (-40,172 won/ton), incineration facilities (-58,646 won/ton), and combustible waste-to-fuel facilities (-60,149 won/ton).The environmental efficiency evaluation based on the environmental and economic performance analyses showed that landfills were most environmentally efficient at 10,837 thousand won/point, followed by the organic waste biogasification facilities (4,760 thousand won/point), food waste recycling facilities (1,540 thousand won/point), incineration facilities (760 thousand won/point), and combustible waste-to-fuel facilities (-184 thousand won/point).More specifically, in terms of the environmental efficiency by facility size, medium-sized facilities were found to have the highest environment efficiency at 2,108 thousand won/point, followed by small facilities (834 thousand won/point), and large facilities (280 thousand won/point). However, in the case of combustible waste-to-fuel facilities, the environmental efficiency of large facilities was the best at 5,306 thousand won/point, followed by small facilities (-212 thousand won/point) and medium facilities (-236 thousand won/point). Also, in the case of organic waste biogasification facilities, large facilities were most environmentally efficient at 10,617 thousand won/point, followed by medium facilities (6,236 thousand won/point) and small facilities (2,859 thousand won/point). The environmental efficiency of food waste recycling facilities turned out to be best for medium-sized facilities at 1,959 thousand won/point, followed by small facilities (1,308 thousand won/point). In the case of food waste recycling facilities, large facilities were not included in the evaluation. The environmental efficiency of landfills for incombustible waste was higher at 18,957 thousand won/point than that of landfills for general waste, which came out to be 9,458 thousand won/point.Based on the results of the environmental efficiency evaluation and a waste disposal scenario based on future projection, the environmental efficiency mix for 2027 was estimated and compared with the current environmental efficiency mix. In the case of waste disposed in volume-rate waste bags, the landfill disposal rate was 31.1%, incineration rate was 53.2%, and combustible waste-to-fuel conversion was 15.6% in 2016, but in 2027, which is the target year of the first Basic Plan for Resource Circulation, it was projected that the rates would change to 2.5%, 33.5%, and 23.5%, respectively. In the case of food waste, 10% was converted to biogas and 90% was recycled into compost or feed in 2016, but in 2027, the rates were projected to be 69.7% and 30.3% in 2027, respectively. Overall, the environmental efficiency mix for all treatment facilities was calculated to be 5,173 thousand won/point in 2016 and 4,118 thousand won/point in 2027. When it was assumed that all landfills were landfills for general waste in 2016 and will become landfills for incombustible waste in 2027, the environmental efficiency mix came out to be 4,744 thousand won/point in 2016 and 4,321 thousand won/point in 2027.The results of the environmental efficiency evaluation were compared with those of the 2016 Evaluation. The comparison revealed that incineration facilities that scored high environmental efficiencies had also received good scores in the 2016 Evaluation, although with some differences that seem to be due to the inclusion of the incineration heat recovery rate in the 2016 Evaluation. Incineration heat recovery rate was excluded from the environmental performance analysis of the present environmental efficiency evaluation, and the life-cycle assessment of the fuel used at incineration facilities was also reflected only in the environmental efficiency evaluation. In the case of combustible waste-to-fuel facilities also, the results of 2016 Evaluation and the environmental efficiency evaluation mostly agreed with each other, with slight differences due to the insignificant effect of SRF production rate on economic performance. In the case of organic waste to biogas facilities, the 2016 Evaluation and environmental efficiency evaluation did not match, which can be attributed to the exclusion of indicators such as odor management, the rate of operation, and facility management, all of which are included in the 2016 Evaluation but not in the environmental efficiency evaluation. For landfills, the 2016 Evaluation and the environmental efficiency evaluation showed similar tendencies, and any differences seemed to have been caused by the discrepancies between the technical evaluation index of the 2016 Evaluation, which includes compaction efficiency and leachate reduction rate, etc., and the index used for the environmental efficiency evaluation.The results of this study were used to develop strategies on how the environmental efficiency evaluation can be utilized through policy implementation. The factors that significantly affected the environmental efficiency evaluation for each waste treatment method were analyzed and listed in Table 4 below, which can be used as an index to improve the environmental and economic performances of the treatment facilities.It may not be appropriate to perform simple comparisons between the environmental efficiencies of individual facilities since their revenues and operational costs, which are used as economic indicators, can vary greatly depending on the location, condition, and operation standards of individual facilities. Therefore, the environmental efficiencies of waste treatment facilities need to be compared among the same facilities or analyzed specifically for individual facilities when identifying and suggesting areas for improvement. As such, three comparison coefficients were proposed for understanding how the environmental efficiency of each waste treatment facility can be improved in comparison to others, namely, the improvement comparison coefficient, benchmark comparison coefficient, and capacity design comparison coefficient.The improvement comparison coefficient can be used to compare the before and after of a specific facility when efforts are made to reduce its economic costs or environmental impacts. The benchmark comparison coefficient can be used as a guideline for identifying whether a particular facility has low environmental efficiency among comparable facilities or needs improvement when compared to the best performing facility of its type, or to understand how effective the efforts toward improvement will be and how much the facility can be improved in terms of its conditions. The capacity design comparison coefficient, on the other hand, provides a guideline for environmental efficiency depending on the size of the facility, thus preventing excessive operational costs projections or potentially adverse environmental impacts when constructing new waste treatment facilities.The improvement comparison coefficient and benchmark comparison coefficient were used to study how an improvement in waste-to-resource capacities at facilities can improve their environmental efficiencies. Specifically, case studies (types A, B, C, D) were performed by assuming an improvement in the waste-to-resources capacities of existing incineration and biogasification facilities with low environmental efficiencies and comparing them against other facilities with different levels of economic and environmental performances. Type A compared between facilities with similar operational costs and environmental performance when the energy recovery (economic value) is improved in the target facility. Type B looked into how the improvement in the target facility’s energy recovery (economic value) would compare to a facility with higher environmental performance, and Type C, to a facility with higher operational costs and similar environmental performance. Lastly, Type D compared the target facility against a facility with higher operating costs and higher environmental performance.In the case of incineration facilities, Hanam incineration facility was chosen for Type A and B case studies to investigate how an improvement in the facility’s thermal energy recovery (economic value) level would make it comparable to Asan and Gumi incineration facility, respectively. For Type C and D, Sejong incineration facility was selected and compared against Asan and Gumi incineration facilities, respectively. In the case of biogasification facilities, only Types B and D were studied due to the limited availability in facility types. For Type B, Gimhae biogasification facility, assuming an improvement in its waste-to-resource production, was compared to Namyangju biogasification facility, and for Type D, Asan biogasification facility was compared to Namyangju biogasification facility.When a 50% improvement was projected for the incineration heat recovery rate of Hanam incineration facility the improvement comparison coefficient came out to be 1.04, and the benchmark comparison coefficient to be 0.56 for Type A and 0.147 for Type B. A 50% improvement in the incinerator heat recovery rate of Sejong incineration facility rendered the improvement comparison coefficient to become 1.03, and the benchmark comparison to become 0.98 for Type C and 0.26 for Type D. Meanwhile, a 35% enhancement in the biogas production of Namyangju biogasification facility resulted in an improvement comparison coefficient of 1.02, and the benchmark comparison coefficients of 0.22 for Type B and 0.40 for Type D.The capacity design comparison coefficient was calculated by computing the mean environmental efficiency by facility size, then comparing it with other facilities of the size that showed the highest environmental efficiency. The capacity design comparison coefficient of small incineration facilities was 0.40, which is better than that of large incineration facilities; and in the case of biogasification facilities, medium-sized facilities had a coefficient of 0.59, which is superior to small biogasification facilities.We propose four ways to translate the present environmental efficiency evaluation into policy implementation: 1) using the evaluation to assess the installation and operation of waste treatment facilities and potential improvements in old facilities, 2) utilizing the evaluation methods in strategic environmental impact assessments and preliminary performance studies, 3) using the evaluation to calculate the social costs of resident subsidy projects and waste disposal charges, and 4) using the evaluation as a guideline for implementing optimization strategies and government-subsidized projects.First, the environmental efficiency evaluation can be applied to the annual evaluation on the installation and operation of waste treatment facilities for assessing the actual conditions of waste treatment operations and improving their energy utilization and recovery and operational efficiency. The current annual evaluation includes the level of efforts made toward improvements such as the efforts to enhance the facility’s economic performance and the efforts of local governments to reduce the amount of waste. However, the annual evaluation has yet to incorporate the level of initiatives for improving environmental efficiency. Thus, it will be helpful to apply the environmental efficiency comparison coefficient presented in Chapter 6.2 to assess the level of efforts to improve the facilities’ operations. Also, based on the survey of treatment facilities nearing the end of their lifecycles, the environmental efficiency comparison coefficient can be used to identify whether the facilities should be improved or closed and to decide whether new facilities should be constructed.Korea’s Act on the Promotion of Waste Treatment Facility Installation and Support to the Surrounding Areas requires strategic environmental impact assessments to be conducted and reviewed in terms of policy plans and basic development plans before making the decisions on the installation cost and site selection when installing and operating waste treatment facilities. Currently, the items reviewed under the strategic environmental impact assessment do not include an environmental performance analysis by facility size, treatment method, or the properties of the waste that is being treated, nor an economic performance analysis on the profitability of the facilities. Therefore, applying the environmental efficiency evaluation conducted in this study will allow a better assessment of the treatment facilities’ suitability in terms of type, size, and location. Also, since the environmental costs included in the preliminary performance studies on environmental facilities are often estimated based on related literature or expert surveys, which can be open to controversy, the methods presented in this study for measuring environmental efficiency using actual data from treatment facilities can be a helpful index for calculating their economic and environmental effects.The environmental efficiency evaluation can also be used to estimate the social costs of resident subsidy projects and waste disposal charges. According to our analysis, the environmental and economic performances of landfills were better than other types of facilities, possibly because the social costs related to operating landfills are much lower. A pilot project for evaluating the environmental efficiency of landfills will help to identify the social costs for preventing environmental pollution and other negative environmental impacts, especially in terms of the land acquisition costs for landfills, which are difficult to measure, by considering both the direct costs and indirect effects (drop in land prices, etc.) in the measurement of economic performance. The comparison of the social costs of landfills to that of incineration facilities showed that the economic value of general landfills was estimated at -368,703 won/ton. Since the average cost of landfill disposal is 14,956 won/ton, our results suggest that the landfill disposal charges be increased by 340,000 won/ton.Government-subsidized waste treatment facility projects aim to promote systematic government support and investment in waste treatment facilities by providing clear subsidy criteria and priorities for regional waste treatment facility installation. At present, the unit cost guidelines for installing government-subsidized treatment facilities is set according to facility type and size, where the lower the facility capacity, the higher the set unit cost subsidized by the government based on the unit cost ratio. This study revealed that the environmental efficiency of small facilities is lower than that of larger facilities, and since small facilities receive more government subsidies due to the unit cost ratio, our findings suggest that it is necessary to revise the guidelines to provide more efficient government support based on optimal facility sizes. A revision of government subsidy guidelines will also provide a useful basis for promoting investment in regional and direct-disposal waste treatment facilities in line with the national policy direction. Furthermore, it may be possible to consider incorporating he environmental efficiency evaluation in reviewing the applications for facility operation budgets and government subsidies based on the Guidelines on the Budget Support and Integrated Administrative Process for Waste Treatment Facilities (Jan 2018), Waste Treatment Facility Optimization Strategy (2011), and the Environmental Technology and Environmental Business Support Act.We anticipate the effects of utilizing the environmental efficiency evaluation as follows. First, by providing a basis for national policies for each waste treatment method through an integrated evaluation of the environmental and economic performances of waste recirculation, the environmental efficiency evaluation will contribute to the implementation of the strategies formulated under goals of the first Basic Plan for Resource Circulation (2018-2027). Secondly, it will become possible to expand the paradigm for assessing the environmental impact of waste treatment facilities from merely looking at their potentials for environmental pollution to a more robust evaluation of environmental and economic performances. Third, by establishing a model for evaluating waste treatment facilities and introducing a minimum standard for environmental-friendliness, the environmental efficiency evaluation will help improve the public image of waste treatment facilities. Fourth, the environmental efficiency evaluation will make it possible to develop strategies for managing environmental impact and pollution levels efficiently, thereby preventing environmental pollution and inducing the development of advanced technologies that consider economic efficiency through eco-innovation.The environmental efficiency evaluation in this study presents a meaningful methodology for improving and optimizing treatment facilities by providing a more accurate comparison of different treatment facilities and methods. In particular, the methods used in the environmental efficiency evaluation identify the most significant factor influencing environmental efficiency among treatment cost, revenue, and environmental impact, thus allowing for the development of better strategies for improving and optimizing individual facilities. The introduction of the environmental efficiency evaluation to government-subsidized projects, environmental impact assessments, etc., may lead to pilot projects for increasing the reliability of the data on each facility as well as expanding the utilization of the evaluation itself.When installing a preventive facility, such as a malodor prevention facility, at a waste treatment facility to control pollutants that may have negative aesthetic and health-related environmental impacts, the improvements made in this area are not included as an indicator in the environmental efficiency evaluation. As such, the facility, despite its advances, may receive a lower environmental efficiency score due to the increase in the facility’s operational costs from installing new equipment. Thus, further research and pilot projects will be necessary to improve the measurement items and methodology used in the present environmental efficiency evaluation to reflect the specific characteristics of the facilities. In addition, in the process of converting negative (-) indices to positive values, the numerical shifts and the avoidance effects were excluded from the economic performance index and the environmental performance analysis, respectively. To strengthen the robustness of the environmental efficiency evaluation conducted in this study, we suggest more case studies to be undertaken, especially on waste treatment facilities that have negative economic values and environmental impacts, and to discuss them at the global level."
Dynamic characteristics of a planetary gear system based on contact status of the tooth surface,2018,"['Planetary gear transmission', 'Meshing stiffness', 'Axial eccentric load', 'Contact area', 'Dynamic characteristics', 'Phase change']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Studies on the planetary gear have attracted considerable attention because of its advantages, such as compactness, large torque-toweight ratio, vibrations, and high efficiency, which have resulted in its wide applications in industry, wind turbine, national defense, and aerospace fields. We have established a novel dynamic model of the planetary gear transmission by using Newton’s theory, in which some key factors such as time-variant meshing stiffness, phase relationships, and tooth contact characteristics are considered. The influences of gear axial tipping, operating conditions, and the meshing phase on the contact characteristics and the dynamic characteristics were researched systematically. It was found that the contact area of the tooth surface was moved due to the axial gear tipping, which obviously affected the meshing stiffness. With the increase in the inclination angle of the sun gear, the meshing stiffness decreases, which produces an evident influence on the high natural frequency in the planetary transmission system. In terms of the dynamic characteristics of the system, the component of rotating frequency appeared in the dynamic meshing force of the sun gear and the planetary gear. Moreover, the floating track of the center wheel varied significantly and exhibited an oval distribution as the inclination angle of the sun gear changed. When the inclination angle of the sun gear increased, the rotating frequency component increased significantly, but the other meshing frequency components remained unchanged; meanwhile, the deformation of the floating track also increased. If the inclination angle of the sun gear changes, the vibration state of the system and the collision impact could become more serious, and the lifetime of the planetary transmission system will reduce. Furthermore, when the load was increased, we found that the gear-tooth contact zone transformed from line contact to surface contact, the meshing stiffness increased, the effect of high natural frequency on the planetary transmission system became more evident, but its low-order natural frequency remained stable. With regard to the dynamic characteristics of the system, the components of the major frequency at the external gearing remained unchanged, but the rotation frequency of the sun gear and the meshing frequency amplitude increased linearly with the increase in load. In conclusion, the variation in the meshing stiffness of the planetary gear system had minor impact on the low-order natural frequency, but had a significant impact on the high natural frequency of the planetary transmission system due to the phase variation of the gear."
Synthesis of aminated calcium lignosulfonate and its adsorption properties for azo dyes,2018,"['Calcium lignosulfonate', 'Ammoniation modification', 'Adsorption', 'Dyes wastewater']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A low-cost adsorbent, aminated calcium lignosulfonate (ACLS) was prepared and successfully applied to the adsorption of Congo red and the Titan yellow dyes. The adsorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), elemental mapping images (EMIs) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. And the efficiency of ACLS for the removal of Congo red and the Titan yellow dyes was evaluated by several factors, such as temperature, pH, adsorbent dose, contact time and initial concentration of dyes solution. And the test ranges of temperature, pH, adsorbent dose, contact time and initial concentration of dye solution were 25–45 °C, 2–12, 0.005–0.05 g, 1–48 h, 10–200 mg L−1, respectively. The adsorption results demonstrated a good ability to remove dye with the removal rates of 97% and 91% for 30 mg L−1 Congo red and 40 mg L−1 Titan yellow, respectively. The adsorption kinetic and adsorption isotherms can be well described by the pseudo second order kinetic and the Langmuir isotherm model for the both dyes, respectively. Moreover, the maximum adsorption capacity of Congo red and Titan yellow reached 258.4 mg g−1 and 190.1 mg g−1 in the study of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, respectively. Thermodynamic studies show that the adsorption of the two dyes is a spontaneous endothermic process. The results indicate that the ACLS has the potential to be used in the treatment of dye wastewater."
"Empirical Analysis on Causation among Service FDI, Service Trade and Economic Growth: Evidence form Korea",2018,"['Economic Growth', 'Services Foreign Direct Investment', 'Services Trade']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The Korean economy has shifted from the manufacturing industry to the service industry since the early 2000s. The purpose of this study is to analyze the causal relationships among trade, foreign direct investment, and economic growth in these transformed industrial structures. We applied the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to analyze the causality between these variables and to estimate the short-term and long-term effects. As a result, service FDI and service exports were found to have a unidirectional effect on economic growth. In the Impulse Response Function, service exports and service FDI were found to have a significant effect on economic growth and service imports. We also found that service exports and service foreign direct investment have a significant impact on economic growth and service imports, and are also important for both variables in their short-term and long-term effects based on the Impulse Response Function and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition. However, the effect of the two variables gradually decreased over time. Therefore, in order for the Korean economy to grow in a service-oriented economy, it is necessary to develop measures for qualitative growth rather than quantitative expansion of service in exports and FDI."

However, in the conventional wax stamped model, which understands memory as a trace left in our minds by the perceptual impression from the outside, we can not properly explain this double face of memory. This is why a new model of the way memories exist is required. Our hypothesis applies to the memory the concept of images presented in Chapter 1 of Bergson’s Matter and Memory, though opposed to Bergson’s own intention, and finds the difference between memory and perception in those of systems of relations of the same images. According to this, the faithful preservation of memory is related to the relation of images in temporal order, and conversely, the variable reproduction of memory is formed in that the same memory image is connected with perceptual image relation system according to the logic of similarity and contiguity. However, the similarity and contiguity described by Bergson coincide with the metaphor and metonymy of the structuralist linguist Jakobson. Therefore, the variable deformation of memory is not a deformation of the memory image itself but a deformation of the ‘semantic’ dimension arising from the memory images being related to the perception images according to the ‘language logic’ of metaphor and metonymy. Thus, this study clarifies the two dimensions of memory which are preservation and free variability by distinguishing between memory image itself and the relations of these ones based on the logic of the language."

Lactobacillus rhamnosus RW-9595M and ATCC 9595 have 99% identical operons coding for EPS biosynthesis, produced different amounts of EPS (543 vs 108 mg/l). L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 transformed with the operons from RW-9595M and ATCC 9595 respectively, produced 326 and 302 mg/l EPS in M17 containing 0.5% glucose. The tyrosine protein kinase transmembrane modulator (Wzd) was proposed to participate in regulating chain elongation of EPS polymers by interacting with the tyrosine protein kinase Wze. While Wzd was found in phosphorylated form in the presence of the phosphorylated kinase (Wze), no phosphorylated proteins were detected when all nine tyrosines of Wzd were mutated to phenylalanine. Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris could produce higher amounts of EPS than other EPS-producing lactococci when expressing genes from L. rhamnosus.

Recently, the importance of Innovation capability as a tool for retaining the competitive advantage keeps growing. While most enterprises are currently seeking well equipped innovation capability, they are not good at creating the culture for facilitating the absorptive capacity and innovation capability. To improve the innovation capability, we propose that organizational culture affects absorptive capacity and innovation capability and, in sequence, the absorptive capacity affects innovation capability in Hi-tech venture enterprises. To test the above propositions, data were collected from a sample of 131 hi-tech venture enterprises in Daedeok Innopolis, the largest and oldest R&D cluster in Korea. In general, absorptive capacity was found as the intervening variable between organizational culture and innovation capability. In addition, organizational culture had a positive effect on absorptive capacity. More managerial implications and brief conclusions were as follows. First, our study suggests that absorptive capacity has a significant positive effect on innovation capability, indicating that absorptive capacity plays an important role in the development of a firm’s innovation capability. Thus, the higher absorptive capacity, the higher innovation capability. As predicted in the hypotheses, the research results also reveal that organization culture has a significant positive effect on absorptive capacity. This is an important finding since it varies from prior studies that treat absorptive capacity as an exogenous variable. Our study finds that organizational culture can both develop and increase a firm’s absorptive capacity. Absorptive capacity can benefit an organization by integrating external knowledge and then transforming it into the firm’s competence. This ability is part of learning oriented organization culture and is the basis of the firm creating sustainable competitive advantages. The research results show that absorptive capacity is the mediating variable between organizational culture and innovation capability, acting as a bridge between the two variables. This means that if absorptive capacity is inadequate, then the organizational culture in a firm will have less direct effect on the firm’s innovation capability. However, if the organizational culture can increase the firm’s absorptive capacity, it may have a significant effect on the firm’s innovation capacity. The completely mediating model found in this study indicates that absorptive capacity is a key strategic factor in improving a firm’s product and procedure innovation capability."

This paper will pay particular attention to how Austen brings a new engagement with the major transformations undergone in the context of the Napoleonic Wars, and her engaged representation of the expansion of women’s newly emerging role at the center of the domestic sphere. The depth of the novelist’s historical understanding of contemporary circumstances can be read in her domestication of the complex and changing social structures in the domestic sphere in a rapidly changing world. The paper will examine the novelist’s sensitive treatment of public events and her incorporation of larger social structures into the concerns of private life through the construction of a plot that is framed by national events occurring offstage. The portrayal of a new model of femininity in the figure of the naval wife and her physical mobility allows Austen to represent a more overtly political female virtue established in a domestic sphere that expands to the nation."

Atomic force microscopy images disclosed that the micelles have spherical structure with the average size of 100 nm. The micelles exhibited high encapsulation efficiency of about 48 ± 0.13% and 84 ± 0.13 for atorvastatin and lisinopril, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry confirmed that strong interaction between atorvastatin and copolymer was the major driving force behind drug loading which subsequently lead to more sustained release behavior of corresponding micelles. Whereas, in case of lisinopril there was no evidence for strong interaction between drug and copolymer. The surface adsorption was the main parameter for drug loading which in turn caused the drug to be quick released. Overall, the results indicated that PLA– PEG–PLA micelles can be considered as a promising carrier for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs with different release characteristics."

B-TO-B RELATIONSHIPS AND CO-CREATION OF VALUE IN THE DIGITAL AGE—QUO VADIS?,2018,"['internet of things', 'S-D Logic', 'disruption', 'digital co-creation of value']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Internet of Things (IoT) research is devoted to the idea that a wide array of devices, including appliances, vehicles, buildings, and cameras, can be interconnected to collect and share their abundant sensory information to use for intelligent purposes. IoT technologies are universally seen as transforming the manufacturing and services sectors. Service-Dominant (S-D) logic focuses on a dynamic, ongoing way to co-create value through resource integration and service exchange. Based on research data from business-to-business and business-to-government customers, as well as feedback from employees and managers of two different manufacturers, our study addresses four questions: (1) In the light of the IoT-does the second axiom of the S-D logic—value is co-created by multiple actors, always including the beneficiary—still hold true for B-to-B and Business-to-Government (B-to-G) customers? (2)With reference to the IoT—is there a difference in the acceptance of digital services between B-to-B and B-to-G groups? Does the age group of the customers have to be considered? (3) Are there digital customer services already perceived as being ―co-created‖ in the sense of the S-D logic? (4) Marketing management in the digital age—how to implement IoT projects in buyer-manufacturer relationships considering the abovementioned chances and challenges. Discussing a background of disruption management and S-D logic, we examine factors that influence IoT buyer–manufacturer project success in organizational networks, and compare the attitude of different customer groups towards these projects. Our findings show that in the IoT-driven digital projects even long term customers that trust in their manufacturers have very strong reservations with regards to data safety. We propose a modular concept of a relationship alignment model to enhance trust in manufacturer's credibility in the context of disruptive IoT projects. The evaluation of our empirical studies revealed serious reservations of managers and service employees towards an active integration of customers into digital product maintenance. If manufacturers are not willing to incorporate customers in digital platforms and networks and provide them with digital services they are interested in, this will hamper A-to-A co-creation of value in digital IoT projects."

The proposed gain scheduling approach is to improve the state convergence rate by increasing the introduced parameters gradually and remove the affect of the partial loss of thruster effectiveness. To obtain the designed controller, we only need to solve a nonlinear equation. Numerical simulations illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed method."

LOYALTY TRANSFER IN TWO-SIDE MARKETS: THE CASE OF ONLINE PAYMENT PLATFORMS,2018,"['platform', 'two-sided market', 'indirect network effects', 'cross-side network effect', 'loyalty transfer']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Introduction With the opening of the 4th revolution era, platform business started to come into the spotlight. It was in the early 2000s that academics started full-scale research on platform based on the two-sided market theory but in fact the two-sided market is a business model that has existed around us since before. Examples include credit card industry, real estate brokering, and auctions. These industries are creating value through the interaction of two markets of different needs through a company that provides a specific platform (Rochet and Tirole, 2003, 2006). Recently, with the widespread use of services and products based on high technology, platform business is pouring into our lives at an amazing speed. With a single ID, you can shop, pay for, and receive shipping from a variety of online stores, without having to go through a lot of memberships. You do not have to search every single hotel for the best price, best location. You can even find a room in the house and see the reviews of customers who have stayed there. Compared to traditional pipeline business, one of the key differentiating features of the platform business is a two-sided network effect where consumers and consumers, producers and producers, and consumers and producers interact with each other. This two-sided network effect, with a positive feedback loop, has become a major driver of platform company growth. In the two-sided market, the platform‟s value to any given user largely depends on the size of the users on the other side of the platform due to the indirect network effect (Evans, 2003; Parker & Van Alstyne, 2005). Therefore, increasing the size of one side market, including the issue of „chicken or egg‟, is an indispensable task for the platform managers to maximize platform performance. But more important than increasing the size of one side of the market is transforming the new customers to loyal customers and creating positive feedback loops. This study explores the process of online payment platform users signing up, forming user loyalty, and spreading the loyalty to the sellers and platform providers. More specifically, this study examines (1) what causes the consumers to join the online payment platform at the beginning (2) what are the drivers that lead new members to the active, loyal users (3) whether the loyalty to the payment platform has a positive effect on the attitude toward the sellers (the other side market) and the platform company (platform provider). Theoretical Background and Hypotheses Two- Sided Markets and the Platform The definition of the two-sided market is varied by scholars. Chakravoti and Roson (2006) defines the two-sided market as a market where two different groups of users interact through the platform and the value created at this time is influenced by the indirect externalities of the network. Here, the platform is a physical, virtual, or institutional environment that allows different groups of users to facilitate transactions or interactions. According to Evans (2003), three necessary conditions for two sided platform markets are: (1) there are two distinct groups of customers; (2) there are externalities associated with customer A and B becoming connected or coordinated in some fashion; (3) an intermediary can facilitate that coordination efficiently than bi-lateral relationships between the members of the group. For example, we can think of a credit card company. There is a group of card holders and merchants and the demands of these two groups are very different. There is also a network effect between the two groups. Customers will not use credit cards with fewer merchants. The greater the number of merchants, the greater the benefits the customers have. Likewise, the more cardholders there are, the more profitable the merchants can generate. The intermediary role of the two groups of users to interact is a credit card company. Perceived value and Loyalty to the Online Payment Platform The loyalty to the online payment system can be expressed as the level of participation and commitment the member has over other similar payment systems. O‟Brien and Jones (1995) argue the value perception as an important prerequisite factor in developing brand loyalty; that is, only after the customer has perceived the online payment system as valuable, then would the customer become loyal to the system. The expectations that the perceived value can affect the loyalty to the online payment platform may be explained in terms of “Social Exchange Theory” (Thibaut and Kelly 1959). Within this framework, the customer will remain in the platform only when he or she perceives the value, which is defined as a trade-off between costs and benefits (Woodruff and Gardial 1996) is sufficient. Overall, perceived value of the online payment platform would affect customer loyalty. More specifically, it is expected that non-economic values such as simplicity in account setting, convenience in use will have a more meaningful effect than the economic value including sign-up grant at the stage of attracting new customers. But in the process of new customers becoming active and loyal users, the economic value including mileage points, discount coupons and free trial coupons will play a more important role in addition to this convenience. For example, benefit of being able to use the accumulated mileage or discount coupon on any online store within the platform will make consumers to stay on this payment platform and become loyal customers. Based on such argument, we put forward the following hypothesis. H1: Non economic value has a positive effect on online payment platform loyalty H2: Economic value has a positive effect on online payment platform loyalty. Loyalty Transfer According to Eisenmann et al. (2006), the platforms exhibit two types of network effects: A same-side effect, in which increasing the number of users on one side of the network makes it either more or less valuable to users on the same side; and a cross-side effect, in which increasing number of users on one side makes it either more or less valuable to the users on the other side. In case of online payment platform, it is expected that there will be a positive cross-side network effect. As the number of consumers using a specific online payment platform increases, the number of partner shops participating in the platform will increase, allowing consumers to shop in more diverse online stores. Once customers experienced the value of a specific online payment system, they would insist on paying by this method when shopping online (Parker, Alstein and Choudary, 2016), that is, becoming a loyal customer. Oliver (1999) defines customer loyalty as a deeply held commitment to re-buy or re-patronize a preferred product or service consistently in the future, thereby causing repetitive same brand purchasing. The loyal customers will be among the many online stores selling the same products/services at a same price, shopping at stores that show their favorite online payment system logo, and encouraging friends and family to use the payment system. The frequent transactions will affect consumer‟s attitude towards a certain brand or store and diffuse their loyalty. The customers that are loyal to the payment platform will not only actively try to earn points but also be willing to go and shop at the stores participating in the platform. Some customers may prefer a store among many even though they have not used it before because it belongs to the platform. The loyalty to the platform also can be transferred to the loyalty on the platform provider. Customers will have a favorable attitude when the platform providers do other business (for example, online banking, debit card business, etc.). Given the above, we put forward the following 3 hypotheses. H3: Platform loyalty has a positive effect on the loyalty toward the sellers, the other side market. H4: Positive attitude toward the sellers within the platform has a positive effect on attitude toward the platform company H5: Platform loyalty has a positive effect on the attitude toward the platform company. Conceptual Framework Data Analysis and Results The data used in this study were obtained from a survey of 562 online payment platform users. Data analysis shows that non-economic values such as simplicity, convenience, and platform reliability have a more significant impact on platform loyalty than economic values such as sign-up bonus. However, it was found that economic factors such as mileage points, and discount coupons are more influential factors in the process of converting new members to active users. In addition, loyalty to the payment system has a positive effect on attitudes towards sellers where one can use the means of payment. Also, it can be seen that the customer loyalty to the platform and the favorable attitude toward the sellers make a favorable attitude toward the platform company providing and managing the two-sided market. Conclusion and Discussion This study may contribute to a better understanding of platform business in three particular ways. First, understanding the loyalty diffusion mechanisms within the platform can support platform companies to develop effective strategies to attract new consumers to the platform and to transform them into active users. Second, even though the study uses the data collected from individual consumer level, the findings may provide some inspiration for B2B relationships. For example, as the number of loyal buyers and sellers sharing the platform increases, the value of the platform increases and the platform company can use it as a powerful bargaining power when it comes to third business. Third, the study may help us to understand the role of Platform in two-sided market and how the customer loyalty becomes diffused. Although this study explored the loyalty formation and diffusion using the sample of the major payment systems in Korea, it may be premature to generalize the findings at this stage. It is important to note that there may be negative network effects. They need to be evaluated further through careful research."

The purpose of this study is to analyze the causal relationships among trade, foreign direct investment, and economic growth in these transformed industrial structures. We applied the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to analyze the causality between these variables and to estimate the short-term and long-term effects. As a result, service FDI and service exports were found to have a unidirectional effect on economic growth. In the Impulse Response Function, service exports and service FDI were found to have a significant effect on economic growth and service imports. We also found that service exports and service foreign direct investment have a significant impact on economic growth and service imports, and are also important for both variables in their short-term and long-term effects based on the Impulse Response Function and Forecast Error Variance Decomposition. However, the effect of the two variables gradually decreased over time. Therefore, in order for the Korean economy to grow in a service-oriented economy, it is necessary to develop measures for qualitative growth rather than quantitative expansion of service in exports and FDI."

The relationship between cadmium and hypertension has been debated as well. We aimed to study the association of lead, cadmium, and both with hypertension in the Korean general population.Methods: We examined 5,967 adult men and 6,074 women who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III-VI (2005, 2008-2013 years). Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between blood lead concentration and blood cadmium concentration and hypertension using log-transformed blood lead and cadmium concentrations as independent variables after covariate adjustment.Results: Adjusted for general characteristics, the odds ratio of log-lead to hypertension was 2.71 (1.82-4.03), and log-cadmium to hypertension was 2.52 (1.83-3.47). Estimates were found to be statistically significant (p<0.001).When a multiple logistic model was applied, the odds ratio of log-lead and log-cadmium for hypertension were 2.24 (1.50-3.36) and 2.24 (1.62-3.10), respectively. The standardized estimate coefficients of log-lead and log-cadmium for hypertension were 4.77 and 6.65, respectively.Conclusion: We observed the association of blood lead concentration, blood cadmium concentration, and both with hypertension. This study suggests that exposure to lead and exposure to cadmium are both risk factors for hypertension."

Increased α2-6 sialylation of endometrial cells contributes to the development of endometriosis,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Endometriosis is a disease characterized by implants of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity and is strongly associated with infertility. Focal adhesion of endometrial tissue to the peritoneum is an indication of incipient endometriosis. In this study, we examined the effect of various cytokines that are known to be involved in the pathology of endometriosis on endometrial cell adhesion. Among the investigated cytokines, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) increased adhesion of endometrial cells to the mesothelium through induction of α2-6 sialylation.The expression levels of β-galactoside α2-6 sialyltransferase (ST6Gal) 1 and ST6Gal2 were increased through activation of TGF-βRI/SMAD2/3 signaling in endometrial cells. In addition, we discovered that terminal sialic acid glycan epitopes of endometrial cells engage with sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin-9 expressed on mesothelial cell surfaces. Interestingly, in an in vivo mouse endometriosis model, inhibition of endogenous sialic acid binding by a NeuAcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAc injection diminished TGF-β1-induced formation of endometriosis lesions. Based on these results, we suggest that increased sialylation of endometrial cells by TGF-β1 promotes the attachment of endometrium to the peritoneum, encouraging endometriosis outbreaks."

Its objective is to design a full-order state observer for offshore platforms in presence of unknown disturbances. To make the method more practical, it is assumed that the measured variables are available at discrete-time instants with time-varying sampling time intervals. By modelling the sampling intervals as a bounded time-varying delay, the estimation error system is expressed as a time-delay system. As a result, the addressed problem can be transformed to the problem of stability of dynamic error between the system and the state estimator. Then, based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functional (LKF), a stability criterion is obtained in the form of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). According to the stability criterion, a sufficient condition on designing the state estimator gain is obtained.

Phillips와Hayes(2006)의 ‘직업적 역할 정체성 형성과정 모델’을 적용해, 수집된 자료로 연구참여자들의 직업 정체성형성 과정을 분석한 결과는 다음과 같다. 결과 : 참여자들은 우연히 스쿠버 잠수를 접하고, 몰입하면서 각기다른 교육 단체를 통해 교육자 인증증을 취득하고 이를 직업화했다. 입직 초기 포지셔닝은 비록 참여자들마다 정도의 차이는 있으나 ‘스포츠사회화 주관자’를 지향했다. 교육자로서의 사명을 인식하고, 그 실천을 위해실천 현장에서 자신들의 정체성에 맞는 보다 ‘차별화된’, 전문적 실천을 보여줘야 한다는 의식을 드러냈다. 이들이 스쿠버 잠수 산업에 들어갈 때는 막연한 정보만 가졌을 뿐이어서, 취미로 즐길 때나 타 전문점에소속되었을 때와는 달리, 전문점 운영자 및 교육자 두 역할을 동시에 수행하면서 난관에 봉착하고 당황하게된다. 다음은 공적 행동을 따라하는 변화로써, 스쿠버 잠수 업계에서 공적으로 일어나는 일들에 적응하게된다. 첫째, 장비 수입상의 공급가 차별, 둘째, 어민들이 가진 선입견, 셋째, 프리랜서 강사들과의 갈등이다. 이들로 인한 교육생들과의 갈등은 규약된 포지셔닝의 스토리라인이 된다. 참여자들은 교육생들이 타 교육자나 교육 단체로 이동한 경험을 가지며, 교육자와 전문점 운영자 간 역할 충돌을 경험했다. 이에 따라 참여자들은 ‘효율적 일처리를 하는 사람’이라는 포지션을 취하며 ‘교육생과 거리두기’, ‘보수 교육과 매뉴얼에 의한안전 중심 교육’에 주력한다. 이어서 실천현장의 문화요소를 받아들이는 과정을 겪는다. 첫째, 공급의 과포화상태에 이른 스쿠버 잠수 산업 문화는 경쟁주의를 낳았다. 둘째, 참여자들은 수많은 인증증이 무분별하게발급되는 사실을 알지만, ‘많을수록 자연스럽게 경쟁하면서 공존할 수 있을 것’이며, 다만 능력이 부족한강사들이 무분별하게 활동하는 현상을 우려한다. 이에 따라 ‘교육생이 원하는’ 좋은 교육자가 되기 위해, ‘나만의 교육 노하우’를 갖는 프로페셔널리즘 문화가 형성됐다. 마지막 단계에서는 스쿠버 잠수 산업 종사자개인의 핵심적 도식이 형성된다. 문화 전유의 과정에서 변형이 일어나 내면화된 도식은 비공식적 상황에서도 지속적 성격을 가지는데, 첫째, 스쿠버 잠수 산업 종사자의 기본 의무는 ‘안전하고 성실한 교육’이라는인식이다. 이를 통해 형성된 ‘교육생과의 유대감’은 직업을 지속하게 만드는 원동력이 된다. 둘째, 장비 판매와 부업은 생계유지를 위해 필요한 조치로 이해된다. 때문에 첫 번째와 두 번째 정체성이 충돌하여 역할갈등을 겪기도 한다. 이 신념들은 종합하여 ‘혼성된 역할 정체성’으로 정리된다.","Purpose : The purpose of this study was to analyze the job identity of workers engaged in scuba diving industry. Research question was ‘What is the process of forming the job identity of workers engaged in scuba diving industry?’ Method : An ethnographic method was selected as method. between June to September 2017, in-depth interviews were conducted with 8 scuba diving shop operators. Analysis of the collected data was applied by Phillips and Hayes (2006) 'a model of professional identity formation'. Conclusion : Most of the participants experienced scuba diving by accident and became immersed into it. They acquired the instructor’s certification and came to have it as their job. The initial positioning was ‘being a person in charge of socializing sports’. They came to enter scuba industry only with unclear feelings, ideas, and information about the realistic situations of it. Next, they change to follow public behavior. 1) The supply prices of equipment importers are discriminated. 2) Fishers have prejudices. 3) They conflict with freelance instructors. The conflict with trainees resulted from these factors forms the storyline of regulated positioning. Therefore, the participants take the positioning as ‘a person handling tasks efficiently’ and strive to ‘be distant from trainees’ and ‘provide safety-oriented education grounded on refresher training and the manual’. Next, they experience the process of accepting cultural elements in the field of practice. 1) The culture of scuba diving industry that has reached the supersaturation of supply has led to severe competition. 2) The participants think there are too many institutes issuing certifications, and the certifications are being issued too recklessly every year. They are worried about the phenomenon that inexperienced and incompetent instructors are coming to this world too recklessly. The last step is that each individual worker engaged in scuba diving industry forms personal schemata. The schemata internalized through transformation in the exclusive possession of culture allow them to be equipped with consistent personality even in unofficial situations. 1) There is perception that the fundamental duty of those engaged in scuba diving industry is ‘safe and diligent training. ‘The fellowship with trainees’ formed by this leads to the drive for them to adhere to their job continuously. 2) Selling equipment and having side jobs are understood as necessary measures to make their living. They sometimes face role conflict due to the conflict between those identity. These beliefs are synthesized and reorganized as ‘hybrid role identity’."
Runtime Detection Framework for Android Malware,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>As the number of Android malware has been increased rapidly over the years, various malware detection methods have been proposed so far. Existing methods can be classified into two categories: static analysis-based methods and dynamic analysis-based methods. Both approaches have some limitations: static analysis-based methods are relatively easy to be avoided through transformation techniques such as junk instruction insertions, code reordering, and so on. However, dynamic analysis-based methods also have some limitations that analysis overheads are relatively high and kernel modification might be required to extract dynamic features. In this paper, we propose a dynamic analysis framework for Android malware detection that overcomes the aforementioned shortcomings. The framework uses a suffix tree that contains API (Application Programming Interface) subtraces and their probabilistic confidence values that are generated using HMMs (Hidden Markov Model) to reduce the malware detection overhead, and we designed the framework with the client-server architecture since the suffix tree is infeasible to be deployed in mobile devices. In addition, an application rewriting technique is used to trace API invocations without any modifications in the Android kernel. In our experiments, we measured the detection accuracy and the computational overheads to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</P>"

<i>Ribes nigrum L</i> . Prevents UVB-mediated Photoaging in Human Dermal Fibroblasts: Potential Antioxidant and Antiinflammatory Activity,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Black currants (Ribes nigrum L, RN) are known as a 'super fruit' to possess for their many potential health benefits such as the alleviation of oxidative stress-related disorders. However, little skin photoaging-related research has been done on the use of this agent. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of RN in UVB-irradiated human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). RN treatment in UVB-irradiated skin models alleviated UVB-mediated photoaging through several mechanisms: Treatment with RN downregulated MAPK-related signaling models, such as those of activation protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). In addition, phase II gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was modulated by the increase in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the nuclear, and finally, transforming growth factor TGF-beta was upregulated in vitro. Further study indicated that UVB-induced production of MMP-1 and IL-6 could be inhibited by PD 98059 (an inhibitor of ERK) and SP600125 (an inhibitor of JNK). Thus, RN improved the expression of type I procollagen and inhibited UVB-induced MMP-1 and IL-6 secretion through inactivating MAPK cascades. Therefore, RN is a suitable target for further investigation as an antiphotoaging agent and may have applications in the skincare industry.</P>"

To derive analytical design relations, the constrained optimal control problem in the time domain was transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem in a new parameter space via an effective parameterization. The resulting optimal PI controller has been verified to yield optimal performance and stability of an open-loop unstable first-order process under operational constraints. The proposed analytical design method explicitly takes into account the operational constraints in the controller design stage and also provides useful insights into the optimal controller design. Practical procedures for designing optimal PI parameters and a feasible constraint set exclusive of complex optimization steps are also proposed.

Fault diagnosis method of rolling bearing using principal component analysis and support vector machine,2018,"['Principal component analysis', 'Support vector machine', 'Feature fusion', 'Fault diagnosis', 'Rolling bearing']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"To effectively extract the fault feature information of rolling bearings and improve the performance of fault diagnosis, a fault diagnosis method based on principal component analysis and support vector machine was presented, and the rolling bearings signals with different fault states were collected. To address the limitation on effectively dealing with the raw vibration signals by the traditional signal processing technology based on Fourier transform, wavelet packet decomposition was employed to extract the features of bearing faults such as outer ring flaking, inner ring flaking, roller flaking and normal condition. Compared with the previous literature on fault diagnosis using principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM), one-to-one and one-to-many algorithms were taken into account. Additionally, the effect of four kernel functions, such as liner kernel function, polynomial kernel function, radial basis function and hyperbolic tangent kernel function, on the performance of SVM classifier was investigated, and the optimal hype-parameters of SVM classifier model were determined by genetic algorithm optimization. PCA was employed for dimension reduction, so as to reduce the computational complexity. The principal components that reached more than 95 % cumulative contribution rate were extracted by PCA and were input into SVM and BP neural network classifiers for identification. Results show that the fault feature dimensionality of the rolling bearing is reduced from 8-dimensions to 5-dimensions, which can still characterize the bearing status effectively, and the computational complexity is reduced as well. Compared with the raw feature set, PCA has a higher fault diagnosis accuracy (more than 97 %), and a shorter diagnosis time relatively. To better verify the superiority of the proposed method, SVM classification results were compared with the results of BP neural network. It is concluded that SVM classifier achieved a better performance than BP neural network classifier in terms of the classification accuracy and time-cost."

Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the regeneration of articular cartilage and subchondral bone, using three-dimensional constructs of autologous adipose tissuederived mesenchymal stromal cells without any biocompatible scaffolds. Mesenchymal stromal cells were harvested by liposuction from seven pigs, isolated enzymatically, and expanded until construct creation. The pig models had two osteochondral defects (cylindrical defects with a diameter of 5.2 mm and a depth of 5 mm) in one of their patello-femoral grooves. A columnar structure consisting of approximately 770 spheroids of 5 9 104 autologous mesenchymal stromal cells were implanted into one of the defects (implanted defect), while the other defect was not implanted (control). The defects were evaluated pathologically at 6 months (in three pigs) and 12 months (in five pigs) after implantation. At 6 months after surgery, histopathology revealed active endochondral ossification underneath the plump fibrocartilage in the implanted defects, but a deficiency of fibrocartilaginous coverage in the controls. At 12 months after surgery, the fibrocartilage was transforming into hyaline cartilage as thick as the surrounding normal cartilage and the subchondral bone was thickening in the implanted defects. The histological averages of the implanted sites were significantly higher than those in the control sites at both 6 and 12 months after surgery. The implantation of a scaffold-free three-dimensional construct of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells into an osteochondral defect can induce regeneration of hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone structures over a period of 12 months."

Low-complexity robust tracking of high-order nonlinear systems with application to underactuated mechanical dynamics,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>This paper presents a low-complexity design approach with predefined transient and steady-state tracking performance for global practical tracking of uncertain high-order nonlinear systems. It is assumed that all nonlinearities and their bounding functions are unknown and the reference signal is time varying. A simple output tracking scheme consisting of nonlinearly transformed errors and positive design parameters is presented in the presence of virtual and actual control variables with high powers where the error transformation technique using time-varying performance functions is employed. Contrary to the existing results using known nonlinear bounding functions of model nonlinearities, the proposed tracking scheme can be implemented without using nonlinear bounding functions (i.e., the feedback domination design), any adaptive and function approximation techniques for estimating unknown nonlinearities. It is shown that the tracking performance of the proposed control system is ensured within preassigned bounds, regardless of high-power virtual and actual control variables. The motion tracking problem of an underactuated unstable mechanical system with unknown model parameters and nonlinearities is considered as a practical application, and simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical result.</P>"

Identifying lysophosphatidic acid receptor subtype 1 (LPA<sub>1</sub>) as a novel factor to modulate microglial activation and their TNF-α production by activating ERK1/2,2018,"['LPA1', 'Septic brain', 'Microglia', 'TNF-α', 'TACE', 'ERK1/2']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Microglia regulate immune responses in the brain, and their activation is key to the pathogenesis of diverse neurological diseases. Receptor-mediated lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling has been known to regulate microglial biology, but it is still unclear which receptor subtypes guide the biology, particularly, microglial activation. Here, we investigated the pathogenic aspects of LPA receptor subtype 1 (LPA<SUB>1</SUB>) in microglial activation using a systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration-induced septic mouse model in vivo and LPS-stimulated rat primary microglia in vitro. LPA<SUB>1</SUB> knockdown in the brain with its specific shRNA lentivirus attenuated the sepsis-induced microglia activation, morphological transformation, and proliferation. LPA<SUB>1</SUB> knockdown also resulted in the downregulation of TNF-α, at both mRNA and protein levels in septic brains, but not IL-1β or IL-6. In rat primary microglia, genetic or pharmacological blockade of LPA<SUB>1</SUB> attenuated gene upregulation and secretion of TNF-α in LPS-stimulated cells.

We reaffirmed these biological aspects using a BV2 microglial cell line in which LPA<SUB>1</SUB> expression was negligible.

A robust low-complexity tracker design with preassigned performance for uncertain high-order nonlinear systems with unknown time-varying delays and high powers,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>A robust low-complexity design methodology is presented for global tracking of uncertain high-order nonlinear systems with unknown time-varying delays. In contrast to the existing literature, this paper assumes that nonlinear bounding functions of time-delay nonlinearities and high powers of virtual and actual control variables are unknown. Furthermore, a delay-independent tracking scheme using nonlinearly transformed error surfaces is simply designed without the knowledge of nonlinear bounding functions of model nonlinearities, the adaptive technique, and the calculation of repeated time derivatives of certain signals. Thus, the proposed tracker is implemented with low complexity. It is recursively shown that the tracking error is preserved within the predefined bounds of transient and steady-state performance in the Lyapunov sense.</P>"

The changes in chemical composition due to the incorporation of collagen into PLGA were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflection mode (FTIR-ATR). The biocompatibility of the FSs was also evaluated in vitro in cultures of mouse fibroblasts and in vivo by subcutaneous implantation studies in rats.

The FTIR-ATR spectrum of Col/PLGA FS revealed the characteristic bands of collagen and PLGA, indicating the co-existence of two fibrous structures. The poor mechanical properties of collagen FS were improved by co-electrospinning with PLGA. In vitro L929 cell proliferation assay revealed that the cyto-compatibility of Col/PLGA FS was increased compared to that of PLGA FS. In addition, Col/PLGA FS showed increased hydrophilic properties sufficient to absorb the exudates at the interface with mild foreign body reactions.

H filter design for offshore platforms via sampled-data measurements,2018,"['offshore platforms', 'H filter', 'sampled-data', 'Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method', 'time-delay']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper focuses on the H filter design problem for offshore steel jacket platforms. Its objective is to design a full-order state observer for offshore platforms in presence of unknown disturbances. To make the method more practical, it is assumed that the measured variables are available at discrete-time instants with time-varying sampling time intervals. By modelling the sampling intervals as a bounded time-varying delay, the estimation error system is expressed as a time-delay system. As a result, the addressed problem can be transformed to the problem of stability of dynamic error between the system and the state estimator. Then, based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functional (LKF), a stability criterion is obtained in the form of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). According to the stability criterion, a sufficient condition on designing the state estimator gain is obtained. In the end, the proposed method is applied to an offshore platform to show its effectiveness."

Recently, the city of Anyang has been showing the limit of `growth city` as it is turning toward the declining population. Therefore, we propose to set the `managed city` as a new urban development model of Anyang city and to suggest the necessity of the transformation of urban policy paradigm for the development of managed city as the core agenda.  It is also necessary to actively respond to changes in the regional policy paradigm at the government level. The government of Moon Jae-in is going to induce the local governments to solve the local problem by strengthening decentralization and local autonomy. Decentralization is the transfer of the authority of the central government to the local governments, and the local governments have authority and autonomy.  As a keyword of urban development strategy that meets the internal and external conditions of urban development, we choose `citizen-centered local politics`, `cooperative governance`, `community`, etc., we did the work. The main areas of proposed policy are decentralization, participation of residents, growth engine, corporate support, local commercial district, declining town area, migrants, green belt, cultural life, cultural infrastructure, village enterprise, social enterprise, town development, community welfare, health societies, and low fertility measures.  It is important to advance urban politics in order for policy alternatives by detailed policy areas to be properly implemented and to produce the intended results. The advancement of urban politics is a state in which citizen-centered cooperative governance is activated and works effectively. Therefore, I devoted a chapter of this report to present the detailed strategies of Anyang City governance development from domestic and overseas case analysis to practical road map."

However, most on-site history museums reproduce the scenes of the time and present them in unidirectional ways owing to their distinct characteristic as historical sites. In order for museums to be turned into an arena for active historical education, it is necessary to transform them into an interactive form where visitors can think about history based on their own experiences. This study analyzed the organization of narrative structure and storytelling methods of historical sites based on the characteristics of on-site history museums through place identity. In addition, the study aimed to suggest guidelines regarding the exhibition methodology of on-site history museums based on the analysis. (Method) This study determined the characteristics of on-site history museums where visitors can understand (meaning) history through experiences (human activity) from exhibitions in a historical place (physical environment) centered on the place identity of Edward Relp. It also identified the characteristics of exhibition media and exhibition storytelling, which can express the narrative structure of on-site history museums, by using the narrative structure of Seymour Chatman for a more effective organization of exhibitions. In addition, to analyze the characteristics of the narrative structure and storytelling of on-site history museums, six museums in Korea and abroad were researched and analyzed. (Results) According to the case analysis, on-site history museums should be organized based on the traits of reproduction, restoration, experience, and exhibition according to the narrative structure of history. However, they have been organized based on the reproduction, restoration, and exhibition of relics. In addition, regarding storytelling, the greatest amount of time is spent on temporality and spatiality according to the characteristics of on-site history museums. In this regard, the spaces of reproduction and restoration are the focus, and interactivity is not utilized very much since the presentation uses unidirectional media, such as relics, models, and panels. (Conclusions) The conclusions of this study are as follows. First, the narrative structure should be appropriately organized according to the situation of the exhibition site. Second, it is necessary to lead visitors to understand the situation of the time through storytelling that breaks down the boundary with visitors and reminds them of the events. Third, it is necessary to organize exhibitions through which visitors can understand and think about the message of exhibitions. Through the aforementioned case analysis, the characteristics of the narrative structure and storytelling of on-site history museums and the direction have been identified. From now on, such museums must turn into places where visitors can experience a variety of historical memories. It is necessary for the storytelling to be presented based on narrative structure, and corresponding future studies should be conducted."

The result of this study shows that after-school English education is believed to be in urgent need of improving the quality of the programs in order to strengthen public performance and expertise in the program. First, it should be transformed into a way that the government should become an operating entity, develop and provide quality programs to schools from one in which individual schools operate programs themselves or on commission. Second, it should provide educational alternatives that allow students to learn more about participation and experience unlike traditional classes. In other words, it is necessary to supplement the limitations of regular classes by developing a model for English education based on Culports (Culture+Sports) combining play, culture and learning. Finally, in order to increase the professionalism and sustainability of teaching and programs, it is necessary to switch from temporary or non-regular-oriented teacher system to a regular teacher system dedicated to after-school education. This requires a mid- to long-term policy vision for after-school English education and a sophisticated implementation plan to implement it. The current study argues that the publicity of after-school English education should be reinforced in the way it absorbs private needs for English education."
HOW DOES BRAND-SPECIFIC LEADERSHIP INFLUENCE ON EMPLOYEE-BASED BRAND EQUITY?,2018,"['brand equity', 'brand-specific TFL', 'brand-specific TRL', 'perceived brand value congruence']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Brand equity (BE) previously focused on consumers’ perceptions under brand marketing stimuli, they often used financial performance indicators for evaluating brand value (Aaker,1996;Keller,1993). However the primary stakeholders of a service brand are employees (Brexendorf & Kernstock,2007).Thus, the enhancement of employee- based BE could be an important topic for in-depth investigation in the fields of brand and internal marketing. Morhart (2009) was the first to introduce the concepts of brand-specific transformational leadership (TFL) and brand-specific transactional leadership (TRL) based on employees’ brand-building behavior. Theory asserts that leaders should endeavor to influence employees through the internalization of brand values and a brand-based role (Morehart,2001) . In the process of brand internalization, leaders with brand experience and brand knowledge should also uphold and constantly reaffirm brand values because they're more capable than ordinary leaders to clearly convey brand values (Hoffman,1999). For this reason, brand-specific leadership based on employee brand-building behaviors is the focus of this study. This study adopts hierarchical linear modeling for individual and organizational-level analyses. This research to investigate (1)whether TFL and TRL have directly affect employee-based individual-level BE.(2)whether TFL and TRL have indirectly affect employee-based BE as an individual-level mediator.(3)how managers use brand-specific leadership to elicit employees’ perceived brand value congruence for improved employee-based BE."

Fucoidan and agave fructan are ingredients that enhance the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut (prebiotics). This mixture has great potential to develop innovative products but it has never been explored before. Because of fucoidan is more expensive than agave fructan, the innovative proposed mixture is vulnerable to adulteration. This research was aimed to assess the accuracy of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR-FTIR) coupled with chemometrics to identify and predict concentration of both polysaccharides in powder mixtures (0-100%). Absorption bands at 1240-1255 and $836-840cm^{-1}$ were attributed to fucoidan and a strong peak at ${\sim}936cm^{-1}$ confirmed the fructan presence. Peak areas were best fitted into linear models ($R^2_{adj}{\geq}0.92$, $RMSE{\leq}3.54%$). This achievement may be useful to certificate ingredients contained in fucoidan-fructan mixtures, preventing adulteration."

Both untreated and chemically treated SG fibers (SGFs) were subsequently characterized using a field emission scanning electronmicroscope, a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, an X-ray diffractometer, a universal testing machine, and a thermogravimetric analyzer. Surface analysis by scanning electron microscopy shows that the alkali treatments promote better outer surface layer than other treatments of the SGF with the exposition of inner fibrillar structure, thereby increasing roughness of the fiber surface. Alkali treatment also improves the crystallinity and exhibits new chemical bond formation inthe SGF. The tensile strength and Young’s modulus have been analyzed through a two-parameter Weibull distribution model, where a significant increase in mechanical property of benzoylated fibers has been observed. The thermal stability of the modified fibers is also found to increase by acetic anhydride treatment."

His disability is regarded as punishment for his immoral attempt to marry Jane while married to Bertha. He has no choice but to compromise his masculinity since he is confined to home due to his disability, which is considered feminine according to Victorian gender ideology. Through his atonement and repentance, Rochester’s disability begins to be cured; and by Jane’s sacrifice and love, his undesirable masculinity is transformed into an ideal one.

On-Line Initialization and Extrinsic Calibration of an Inertial Navigation System With a Relative Preintegration Method on Manifold,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are successfully utilized to compensate localization errors in sensor fused inertial navigation systems. An IMU generally produces high-frequency signals ranging from 100 to 1000 Hz, and preintegration methods are applied to effectively process these high-frequency signals for inertial navigation systems. The main problem with an existing preintegration method is that the inertial propagation models in the method are only generated at the IMU’s coordinate system. Hence, the models have to be converted to the coordinate system of the other sensor in order to apply its constraint. So, the iterative optimization framework using the conventional method takes large amount of time. In addition, since a general rigid body transformation cannot transfer a velocity propagation model to the other coordinate system, the concept of relative motion analysis needs to be considered. To solve the problems above, in this paper, we propose a novel relative preintegration (RP) method that can generate inertial propagation models at any sensor’s coordinate system in a rigid body. This permits accurate and fast IMU processing in sensor fused inertial navigation systems. We applied new nonlinear optimization frameworks to solve initialization and extrinsic calibration problems for the IMU–IMU, IMU–Camera, and IMU–LiDAR pair based on the proposed RP method in an on-line manner, and the superior results of the mentioned processes are presented as well. <I>Note to Practitioners</I>—In the proposed method, extrinsic calibration parameters can be estimated during the localization process without any initial manual precalibration procedure. Besides, an IMU is small and inexpensive, so small AGVs in warehouses, or mobile manipulators in factories are good applications for the proposed method, where they require a certain level of localization accuracy. The localization module using the proposed method can be mounted anywhere in a robot without restrictions. The initialization procedure has been executed for a few seconds with arbitrary movement in the field of view of the first frame, then the initial gravity and velocity vector, and extrinsic parameters, which are estimated during the initialization phase, are applied to a general SLAM problem.</P>"

Furthermore, there has lately been a transformation in national leadership from government-initiation to the joint participation of the government and civil society, both of which having its own respective role in what may be called participatory reform. Likewise, all social sectors are to join in recognizing, sorting and redressing social issues at hand. From this point of view, “a gender-equal community” is suggested in this study as a means of resolving the structural and sustaining issue of inequality between men and women under communalism. To provide a theoretical background, the details of the proposed community of gender equality are discussed on the basis of communalism. This is to realize a society in which men and women stand on an equal footing. This study signifies a new approach as has never been attempted to tackle the problem of gender inequality, though the model presented here is of an initiative nature."
Role of protein kinase Cδ in dopaminergic neurotoxic events,2018,"['Protein kinase Cδ', 'Dopaminergic toxicity', 'Oxidative stress', 'Mitochondrial dysfunction', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Intermediary role']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The pro-apoptotic role of Protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), a member of the novel PKC subfamily, has been well-documented in various pathological conditions. In the central nervous system, the possible role of PKCδ has been studied, mainly in the condition of dopaminergic loss. It has been suggested that the phosphorylation of PKCδ at tyrosine 311 residue (Tyr<SUP>311</SUP>) by redox-sensitive Src family kinases (SFKs) is critical for the caspase-3-mediated proteolytic cleavage, which produces the constitutively active cleaved form of PKCδ. Mitochondrial translocation of cleaved PKCδ has been suggested to facilitate mitochondria-derived apoptosis and oxidative burdens. Moreover, it has been suggested that PKCδ contribute to neuroinflammation through the transformation of microglia into the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and the assembly of membrane NADPH oxidase in dopaminergic impairments. Interestingly, mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors or neuroinflammogens have shown to induce PKCδ activation in dopaminergic systems. Thus, PKCδ activation may be one of the pivotal causes of neuropathologic events, and could amplify these processes further in a positive feedback manner. Furthermore, PKCδ may play an intermediary role in connecting each neuropathologic event.

In this study, both the motion responses of vessel which the pedestal will be mounted and the behavior of 3-axis pedestal are considered. Numerical analysis based on potential theory is used to obtained motion characteristics of vessel and then 6-DOF motions of vessel are simulated under operational condition. 1st-order time delay model and LQR control algorithm are used for modeling of pedestal drive model and control model, respectively. By using coordinate transform, the angular motions which the pedestal should compensate are calculated from the vessel's angular motion.

The results from both ordinary least squares estimator and structural estimation model suggest that the experience of informal economic activities by the refugees while they were residing in North Korea facilitates support for a market economy. This finding indicates that the informal economy in North Korea can be regarded as a factor transforming North Koreans’ mind-sets."
Autonomous operation algorithm for safety systems of nuclear power plants by using long-short term memory and function-based hierarchical framework,2018,"['Nuclear power plant', 'Autonomous operation', 'Safety system', 'Long short-term memory', 'Function-based hierarchical framework']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>With the improvement of computer performance and the emergence of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, an autonomous operation based on AI is being applied to many industries. An autonomous algorithm is a higher-level concept than conventional automatic operation in nuclear power plants (NPPs). In order to achieve autonomous operation, the autonomous algorithm needs to include superior functions to monitor, control and diagnose automated subsystems. This study suggests an autonomous operation algorithm for NPP safety systems using a function-based hierarchical framework (FHF) and a long short-term memory (LSTM). The FHF hierarchically models the safety goals, functions, systems, and components in the NPP. Then, the hierarchical structure is transformed into an LSTM network that is an evolutionary version of a recurrent neural network. This approach is applied to a reference NPP, a Westinghouse 930 MWe, three-loop pressurized water reactor.

He thinks that the personal and social characteristics of human beings are inseparable. Therefore, Turgenev tests his or her subjects by participating in complex social psychological conflicts. The principle of composition of a novel is also derived here.  The main characters of Turgenev accept the laws of life and their personal fate as fatal. At this point, he can represent a typical representation of liberal intelligence in the 1840s. The love plot of the Turgenev novel, reveals the complex dialectics of individuals and societies. ""The woman of Turgenev"" is mentally stronger than the male character who is destined to meet. Nataliya Lasunskaya of <Rudin> is that type. The behavioral model she poses is embryologically circular with Tatiyana of the Pushkin.

Convolutional Neural Network-Based Land Cover Classification Using 2-D Spectral Reflectance Curve Graphs With Multitemporal Satellite Imagery,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Researchers constantly seek more efficient detection techniques to better utilize enhanced image resolution in accurately detecting and monitoring land cover. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown high performances comparable to or even better than widely used and adopted machine learning techniques. The aim of this study is to investigate the application of CNNs for land cover classification by using two-dimensional (2-D) spectral curve graphs from multispectral satellite images. The land cover classification was conducted in Concord, New Hampshire, USA, and South Korea by using multispectral images acquired from 30-m Landsat-8 and 500-m Geostationary Ocean Color Imager images. For the construction of input data specific to CNNs, two seasons (winter and summer) of multispectral bands were transformed into 2-D spectral curve graphs for each class. Land cover classification results of CNNs were compared with the results of support vector machines (SVMs) and random forest (RFs). The CNNs model showed higher performance than RFs and SVMs in both study sites. The examination of land cover classification maps demonstrates a good agreement with reference maps, Google Earth images, and existing global scale land cover map, especially for croplands. Using the spectral curve graph could incorporate the phenological cycles on classifying the land cover types. This study shows that the use of a new transformation of spectral bands into a 2-D form for application in CNNs can improve land cover classification performance.</P>"

The fourth industrial revolution is realized and diffused by the convergence of technologies in physics, digital and biological fields, and specific examples of new technologies that affect social structure change, such as IoT, artificial intelligence, 3D printing technology, and self-driving technology. It is clear that the transformation through the four revolution will be different in its scale, scope, and complexity, when it is compared with changes through previous industrial revolutions. AI technology plays the most important role in transitioning to super-connected society and algorithmic society. The article said that the commercialization of artificial intelligence, which embodied the intelligence of thinking in Korean society, had a significant impact on people’s lifestyle, labor, production, distribution, and occupation, but that the system was still limited by human help. Also, with the features of modern technology such as artificial intelligence, we looked at the meaning of the computational model of intelligence and the possible risks of it through the technology philosophy of Heidegger and Don Ihde. Finally, it was considered that the logic leading the fourth industrial revolution, particularly the logic of developing and commercializing natural intelligence through artificial intelligence research, can be clearly seen through the distinction between primary and reflective scientific techniques, and Beck’s technical risk logic is still valid."

In contrast, nominal variables have often been eliminated due to their ambiguity in spite many nominal variables exist in real data. Defining distance measures is essential in cluster analysis methodologies based on distances among objects; therefore, it is important to define distance measures reasonably. When there exist both types of variables, we employ and compare the dummy variable transformation method used for modeling, Gower’s method assigning distances according to matching of categories, and Eskin’s method utilizing their category levels. Three evaluation measures are used for fair comparison regardless of the definitions of distance measures. As a result, Eskin’s method performs better than the others in the unbalanced cases of object numbers and spread degrees. In addition, Eskin’s method is superior in the cohesion and reproducibility of clusters and finding of cluster numbers."

Moreover, they do not require pre-reduction. In this study, ash-free coal (AFC) was obtained by the thermal extraction of carbonaceous components from raw coal and its performance as a carbon catalytic support was compared with that of well-known activated carbon (AC). Nickel was dispersed on the carbon supports and the resulting catalysts were applied to the steam reforming of toluene (SRT), a model compound of biomass tar. Interestingly, nickel catalysts dispersed on AFC, which has a very small surface area (~0.13 m2/g), showed higher activity than those dispersed on AC, which has a large surface area (1,173 m2/g). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the particle size of nickel deposited on AFC was smaller than that deposited on AC, with the average values on AFC ≈11 nm and on AC ≈23 nm. This proved that heteroatomic functional groups in AFC, such as carboxyls, can provide ion-exchange or adsorption sites for the nano-scale dispersion of nickel. In addition, the pore structure, surface morphology, chemical composition, and chemical state of the prepared catalysts were analyzed using Brunauer-Emmett-Taylor (BET) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and temperature- programmed reduction (TPR)."

By doing this, this study focuses on the role of workplace industrial and labor relations regime, and argues that the labor relations and HR practices at the firm level can either augment or reduce the negative effects of emotional dissonance. For this, this study conducted in-depth interviews with call center workers and managers. As a result, this study finds that when workplace rules, polices and practice do not protect workers’ labor right, the emotional exhaustion and burnout of call center workers increase. Similarly, Taylorist models of work organization increase the negative effects of emotional labor by its excessive focus on quantitative performance goals, its intensive monitoring that even violates workers’ right to rest, and its lower levels of workers’ job discretion. Lastly, the presence of labor union makes it possible for workers to reduce the arbitrary control of managers and to restore the interactional injustice by manifesting collective voice at workplace. The findings of this study contribute to overcome the limits of past studies that exclusionary focused on the differences in emotional traits and strategies of individuals to explain the differences in the effects of emotional labor. This study contributes to fill the vacuum of the emotional labor research by finding the crucial role played by workplace industrial and labor relations regime in moderating the effects of emotional labor. In doing this, this study suggests that, in order to reduce the human costs of emotional labor, we need to transform the Taylorist workplace regime into a humanistic regime that promotes workers’ labor right and organizational justice."

The purpose of this work was to determine whether chemical conjugation between hair keratin proteins restores tensile strength and thus results inpreventing further deterioration under repeated combing. A model damaged hair tress was produced by a typical perm-process. Then, it was internally crosslinked by the bifunctional crosslinker (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), via both silane coupling and carbodiimide chemistry. Physical properties, including tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and plateau stress, were measured to verify the effect of internal crosslinking, and the existence of crosslinking was verified by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The degrees of hair breakage and split ends were evaluated by repeated combing-drying tests. Physical properties of chemically damaged hair were restored by internal crosslinking. Successful crosslinking of APTES via both silane coupling and carbodiimide chemistry was verified by FT-IR spectra. Prevention of breakage and split ends after repeated combing with heat was observed. Human hair can be weakened by chemical damage including perm-processing, so restoring such properties is a major issue in the hair care industry. This work shows that internal crosslinking of damaged hair via chemical conjugation would be a potent method to restore the healthy hair."
Activation of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Promotes Neuroprotection in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis by Reducing Neuroinflammatory Responses,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The signaling axis of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) has been an important component in overcoming diabetes, and recent reports have uncovered novel beneficial roles of this signaling axis in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral ischemia, accelerating processes for exendin-4 repositioning. Here, we studied whether multiple sclerosis (MS) could be a complement to the CNS disorders that are associated with the GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling axis. Both components of the signaling axis, GLP-1 and GLP-1R proteins, are expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in the spinal cord of normal mice. In particular, they are abundant in Iba1-positive microglia. Upon challenge by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, the mRNA expression of both GLP-1 and GLP-1R was markedly downregulated in EAE-symptomatic spinal cords, indicating attenuated activity of GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling in EAE. Such a downregulation obviously occurred in LPS-stimulated rat primary microglia, a main cell type to express both GLP-1 and GLP-1R, further indicating attenuated activity of GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling in activated microglia. To investigate whether increased activity of GLP-1R has a therapeutic benefit, exendin-4 (5 mu g/kg, i.p.), a GLP-1R agonist, was administered daily to EAE-symptomatic mice. Exendin-4 administration to symptomatic EAE mice significantly improved the clinical signs of the disease, along with the reversal of histopathological sequelae such as cell accumulation, demyelination, astrogliosis, microglial activation, and morphological transformation of activated microglia in the injured spinal cord. Such an improvement by exendin-4 was comparable to that by FTY720 (3 mg/kg, i.p.), a drug for MS. The neuroprotective effects of exendin-4 against EAE were also associated with decreased mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, all of which are usually upregulated in injured sites of the EAE spinal cord. Interestingly, exendin-4 exposure similarly reduced mRNA levels of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in LPS-stimulated microglia. Furthermore, exendin-4 administration significantly attenuated activation of NF-kappa B signaling in EAE spinal cord and LPS-stimulated microglia. Collectively, the current study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of exendin-4 for MS by reducing immune responses in the CNS, highlighting the importance of the GLP-1/GLP-1R signaling axis in the development of a novel therapeutic strategy for MS.</P>"

But it should be noted that sentimental excess as the cause of enormous popularity is intended by the author for his moral vision. Mackenzie believes that the blind pursuit of self-interest, if not checked, necessarily brings about moral degeneration. His idealization of Harley as a model of virtue, which engages with the critical debate on his mechanical response to the unfortunate, indicates the presence of social injustice as well as the urgent need for virtue. Assuming that virtuous sentiments, on which virtue depend, can be cultivated by the sentimental novel, he employs nearly all literary devices to maximize sentimental responses from readers. Most remarkable is the fragmentedness of the novel, which enables readers to get more deeply involved in the feelings of the book. By leading readers to experience a gamut of feelings from laughter to frustration and to despair, and ultimately feel sympathy with the moral vision of the novel, he seeks to transform them into sentimental subjects of virtue."

Instead of translating nature’s response to human suffering into human terms, the Pedlar presents the spear-grass, a weed, as a model for “ecstatic dwelling,” which can be learned only when one radically transforms traditional discourses of humanism, personhood, and community. Margaret’s failure to dwell and the subsequent destruction and ruination of the dwelling are intermeshed with her melancholic commitment to the notion of oikos as an original, stable site of unity and identity. In contrast, the spear-grass in the “addendum” practices the art of dwelling that makes a home in exile. The survival of the spear-grass in the ruined cottage correlates with a particular sense of belonging, which does not have an antithetical relationship to non-belonging. Unloved and unwanted in the world and never given a proper place, as in the case of Margaret, the spear-grass experiences a foreign place as a home, one that is redefined as a place of difference, where one can enjoy tranquility, however, precarious and temporary."

A lot of difficulties should be overcome, however, for a machine to attain a technical level high enough to render an intelligent and credible judicial judgment based on the information retrieved from traditional legal documents. We thus need to advance the transformation of the legal system to a symbolic logic system, which can be called “machine-readable law” or “computational law,” by enhancing its logicality and consistency. The automated application of law, which may not fully replace a human decision unless we, based on extreme legal formalism, denythe indeterminacy of legal terms and judicial discretion, could instead enhance lawyers’ concentration on the creation of law at borderline cases. The civil law system’s tradition of legal conceptualism, which stresses the self-contained and autonomous nature of law, tends to bring a heightened chance of success of this innovation, but such merit isundermined by outdated dogmas that rather impede innovation. The academia’s existing effort to surmount the dogmas can be a starting point for this innovation. Once this preparatory work is done, valuable data can be automatically accumulated so as to efficiently train various statistic models, giving a quantum leap in the application ofartificial intelligence to law. While the application of artificial intelligence is also constrained by ethical issues, it is expected to enhance the consistency and fairness of the judicial proceeding at least in the capacity of an amicus. The steps to realize this innovation can include the systematization of the application of laws, standard contracts, fact-finding, and the assessment of proofs."

First, L<sub>2,1</sub> norm regularization can promote the projection matrix row-sparsity, which makes the feature selection and subspace learning simultaneously. Second, uncorrelated features of minimum redundancy are effective for classification. We define 2D statistically uncorrelated model that each row (or column) are independent. Third, we provide a feasible solution by transforming the proposed L<sub>2,1</sub> nonlinear model into a linear regression type. Additionally, 2DSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub> is extended to a bilateral projection version called BSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub>. The advantage of BSFDA-L<sub>2,1</sub> is that an image can be represented with much less coefficients.

Discrete atomic information, obtained from molecular dynamics simulation of crack propagation along GBs in polycrystalline solids, is incorporated with asymptotic singular fields near an interfacial crack tip between dissimilar materials in the atomic-level J-based mutual integral, to extract the individual stress intensity factors of modes I and II. As a model problem, crack propagation along GBs in polycrystalline graphene, an ordered array of non-hexagonal defects, is analyzed. In the model, GBs are considered to be the most favorable paths for crack propagation, as the carbon atoms along the GBs experience less-ordered interatomic interactions than those in pristine graphene. When a mixed-mode loading is applied to a crack running along a graphene GB, as the mode mixity increases, the fracture toughness of GBs in graphene gradually increases. However, if the mode mixity is greater than 8°, the fracture toughness gradually decreases, which can be considered a unique characteristic of GBs in graphene. This abnormally-low fracture toughness of GBs in graphene for high mode mixity, may be interpreted as the competition between bond-rotation and bond-breaking mechanisms of carbon atoms, in conjunction with the Stone–Wales transformation and nonagon structures at the crack tip along GBs in graphene.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  A numerical calculation based on atomic-level J-based mutual integral is developed to extract the individual stress intensity factors. </LI> <LI>  The individual stress intensity factors are calculated to quantitatively characterize the fracture behaviour of grain boundaries in graphene. </LI> <LI>  The correlation between the fracture toughness and the density of defects is found. </LI> <LI>  The fracture toughness of GBs in graphene is abnormally low under high mode mixity. </LI> </UL> </P>"

And using the PSD function of measured data, the results in the frequency domain were also analyzed. We judged that VDMS is able to identify the higher system mode and has sufficient reliability. Based on the reliability verification, we conducted tests for long-distance applicability for actual application of VDMS. The distance from the stationary target model structure was increased by 50m interval, and the maximum distance was set to 400m. From the distance of 150m, the image obtained by the commercial camcorder has an error in the analysis, so the measured displacement comparison was performed between the LDS and the refractor telescope measurement results. In the measurement results of the displacement area of V DMS, the data validity was deteriorated due to the data shift by the external force and the quality degradation of the enlarged image. However, even under the condition that the effectiveness of the displacementmeasurement data of VDMS is low, the first mode characteristic included in the free vibration of the object is clearly measured. If the influence from the external environment is controlled and stable data is collected, It is judged that reliability of long-distance VDMS can be secured."

Effective Computational Approach for Prediction and Estimation of Space Object Breakup Dispersion during Uncontrolled Reentry,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>This paper provides an effective approach for the prediction and estimation of space debris due to a vehicle breakup during uncontrolled reentry. For an advanced analysis of the time evolution of space debris dispersion, new efficient computational approaches are proposed. A time evolution of the dispersion of space pieces from a breakup event to the ground impact time is represented in terms of covariance ellipsoids, and in this paper, two covariance propagation methods are introduced. First, a derivative-free statistical linear regression method using the unscented transformation is utilized for performing a covariance propagation. Second, a novel Gaussian moment-matching method is proposed to compute the estimation of the covariance of a debris dispersion by using a Gauss-Hermite cubature-based numerical integration approach. Compared to a linearized covariance propagation method such as the Lyapunov covariance equation, the newly proposed Gauss-Hermite cubature-based covariance computation approach could provide high flexibilities in terms of effectively representing an initial debris dispersion and also precisely computing the time evolution of the covariance matrices by utilizing a larger set of sigma points representing debris components. In addition, we also carry out a parametric study in order to analyze the effects on the accuracy of the covariance propagation due to modeling uncertainties. The effectiveness of the newly proposed statistical linear regression method and the Gauss-Hermite computational approach is demonstrated by carrying out various simulations.</P>"

The photocatalytic degradation of synthetic anionic dyes, methyl orange (MO) and Congo red (CR), and industrial textile wastewater dyes under visible light irradiation was evaluated. The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized structurally and morphologically using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscope, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Evaluation of the colour indicated complete removal at 15 min of irradiation for the MO and CR dyes, with 99% degradation efficiency. The reaction time for the primary effluent wastewater dye was 60 min for 81% dye removal. In contrast, a longer reaction time was required to meet the national discharge regulation for the raw wastewater dye, 300 min for 60% dye removal. The mechanism for dye degradation using the Graphene-CuO-Co3O4 hybrid nanocomposite was elucidated using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, and the rate constant and half-life of the degradation process were calculated. The results demonstrate that photocatalytic degradation using a hybrid nanocomposite and visible light irradiation is a sustainable alternative technology for removing colour from wastewater dye.</P>"

MC-Fluid: Multi-Core Fluid-Based Mixed-Criticality Scheduling,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Owing to growing complexity and scale, safety-critical real-time systems are generally designed using the concept of mixed-criticality, wherein applications with different criticality or importance levels are hosted on the same hardware platform. To guarantee non-interference between these applications, the hardware resources, in particular the processor, are statically partitioned among them. To overcome the inefficiencies in resource utilization of such a static scheme, the concept of mixed-criticality real-time scheduling has emerged as a promising solution. Although there are several studies on such scheduling strategies for uniprocessor platforms, the problem of efficient scheduling for the multiprocessor case has largely remained open. In this work, we design a fluid-model based mixed-criticality scheduling algorithm for multiprocessors, in which multiple tasks are allowed to execute on the same processor simultaneously. We derive an exact schedulability test for this algorithm, and also present an optimal strategy for assigning the fractional execution rates to tasks. Since fluid-model based scheduling is not implementable on real hardware, we also present a transformation algorithm from fluid-schedule to a non-fluid one. We also show through experimental evaluation that the designed algorithms outperform existing scheduling algorithms in terms of their ability to schedule a variety of task systems.</P>"

To provide an alternative to conventional processes, one of the radical-based advanced oxidation and reduction processes being tested for treatment of refractory compounds in water, involves the use of an electron beam. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the degradation efficiency of PFOS (100mg/L) by electron beam, to evaluate the predicted toxicity of the radiolysis products using the ECOSAR model, and to identify the radiolytic products of PFOS. As a result of using the ECOSAR model, the toxicity levels of by-products after electron beam treatment were reduced by decreasing the carbon-chain number of PFOS. The molecular structures of the radiolytic products were elucidated using authentic standards via liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, and by the interpretation of MS<SUP>2</SUP> fragmentation patterns of each product using liquid chromatography with quadrupole time of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). In total, ten radiolytic products were confirmed by LC-MS/MS, HPLC, and IC data matching with commercial standards. The two radiolytic substances produced during irradiation with an electron beam were predicted by LC-QTOF-MS.

An upcycling design is rapidly emerging in response to the social and environmental demand for sustainable life resulting from changes in society and industry. We are at the threshold of the age of design, thanks to a networked society connected by Internet broadband. Design educators—often the first to think about space—are also creating a demand for new content-oriented alternatives . Corresponding to the current wave of change, the fields of design and design education have become tailored to a new integrated system, which represents a transformation from the early industrial format of the 20th century. This paper begins from the viewpoint that upcycling design is an innovation, not just as an environmental dimension or a professional designer’s dimension. The purpose of this study is to investigate and revise the value of upcycling design according to creative educational contents for citizens reflecting current trends—in other words, as a “social innovation.” (Research Method) The hypothesis of the study is that upcycling design has the potential to provide the content for an interesting alternative design education program based on problem solving, social innovations (contributions), co-designs, and collaboration among participants and designers (educators). The methodology of this paper is qualitative research based on case studies and analyses. Based on the hypothesis, cases of overseas upcycling design education programs were surveyed, and relevant characteristics were extracted and verified. (Results) As a result, this paper identifies the four characteristic elements of social innovation for a citizen education program (based on a case study). This paper presents a “characteristic map of the contents of the upcycling design education program” and a “characteristic model of the citizen education program.” (Conclusions) In summary, this paper provides the groundwork for a basic study on the expansion of theoretical and practical domains of upcycling design concepts. It also gives direction for the practical alternative of design education from the perspective of social innovation reflecting the needs of the times. This paper will contribute to the design of a suitable content governance system that is necessary for educational program development and planning of alternative public education institutions and cultural spaces."
Fabrication of a Biodegradable Multi-layered Polyvinyl Alcohol Stent,2018,"['Textiles', 'Biomaterials', 'Biodegradable', 'Biocompatibility', 'Crosslinking']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study aims to develop biodegradable vascular stents that prevent permanent damage caused by rejection of the immune system of the human body. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) yarns are twisted to enhance their strength. The twisted yarns are braided and then coated with chitosan (CS). The CS-coated PVA vascular stents are chemically crosslinked with genipin (GP) to improve their flexibility and biodegradability. Their morphological characteristics are also observed using a stereoscopic microscope, and their properties are evaluated through scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, bending test, biodegradability test, drug release measurement, and MTT assay. Results reveal that wet PVA-CS-GP vascular stents coated with multiple CS layers can maintain a tubular structure when they are bent. After crosslinking is performed, the compressive strength of the PVA-CS-GP stents is 17.04 times higher than that of pure PVA. The weight loss rate of the PVA-CS-GP vascular stents as <3 % after 30 days. The PVA-CS-GP vascular stents composed of 0.10 % heparin sodium show a good drug release effect. Biological activity test indicates that these stents exhibit good proliferation, and our structural model verifies that they are good vascular stents."
Addressing the Agri-Food Crisis in Korea: Implications of Food Sovereignty and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants,2018,"['rights of peasants', 'global agri-food system', 'food sovereignty', 'alternative agri-food movement', 'La Vía Campesina']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A variety of discussions about the revision of the constitution are underway in Korea.One important issue currently being debated is the rights of peasants guaranteed in agriculture-related provisions. Including peasants’ rights in agriculture-related provisions is one of the key issues in this constitutional revision. La Vía Campesina and other international human rights organizations first coined the term “rights of peasants” and there are now ongoing attempts to draw-up a draft declaration on the rights of peasants in the UN Human Rights Council. This paper outlines the implications of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants as a direction for a sustainable agriculture model that can suggest alternatives to the global agri-food system to be included in Korea’s new constitution. To this end, this paper analyzes historical changes in the food security regime and international agri-food policies and also traces the transformation of Korean agriculture correlated with changes to the international regime. Consequently, this paper demonstrates the important contribution on discussions regarding the rights of peasants in the UN to proliferate alternative discourses on contemporary agri-food systems both at global and national level."

Second, this paper explains the particularities of Chinese socialism in the late 1970s compared with the former Soviet Union and East European socialist countries and defines the local state models like local state corporatism, entrepreneurialism, developmentalism, predatory state. Finally, focusing on the birth of Chinese characteristic capitalists, Meilaoban, this paper clarifies the role of the cadres and bureaucrats of Shanxi Province in transforming the state owned enterprises into the private enterprises in the coal mining industry and finds out that Meilaoban who are created by the local state commits the dispossession of the public assets to build a huge amount of wealth of his own."
Analysis of Contact Pressure at Knee Cartilage during Gait with Respect to Foot Progression Angle,2018,"['Toe-in gait', 'Motion analysis', 'Finite element analysis', 'Knee cartilage', 'Foot progression angle']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"One of the main causes that make knee osteoarthritis (OA) worse is load concentration at the medial compartment of knee cartilage. It is alternatively measured by employing knee adduction moment (KAM). Since toe-in gait decreases the 1st peak of KAM, it has been considered as a non-surgical prevention of OA progressing. However, direct measures such as contact pressure at knee cartilage in motion have not been available so far. Obtaining contact pressure at knee cartilage by FE analysis is difficult because exact muscle forces are not available and because FE model should be reconstructed at every stance phase. To obtain contact pressure at knee cartilage during gait, a method employing FE analysis based on motion analysis has been used in this study. Reference FE model of lower extremities was constructed and transformed to specific stance phases of gait. Ground reaction forces and muscle forces from motion analysis were employed as loading conditions. Finally, contact pressure distributions on knee cartilage at 1st peak, mid stance, 2nd peak could be obtained with respect to foot progression angle. The result shows that toe-in gait could be effective for knee OA patients by dispersing contact pressure concentrated in medial knee compartment to lateral part."
모자보건을 위한 삼차흡연 연구의 필요성,2018,"['maternal health', 'child health', 'smoke', 'tobacco smoke pollution']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The causal relationship between cigarette smoking during pregnancy and adverse maternal and child health outcomes, such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and sudden infant death syndrome are well known. In addition, cigarette compounds are neurotoxic even at extremely low levels. Thirdhand smoke (THS) is the contamination that persists after secondhand tobacco smoke has been emitted into air. It refers to the tobacco-related gases and particles that become embedded in materials such as carpets, walls, furniture, blankets, and toys. THS is not strictly smoke but chemicals that adhere to surfaces from which they can be released back into the air, undergo chemical transformations, and/or accumulate. The concept of THS is a relatively new phenomenon in the environmental and public health field. Currently, the hazards of THS are not as well documented as the hazards of secondhand smoke. Furthermore, its health effects and biological effects are largely unknown. This review summarizes recent research progress in reproductive toxicology studies that use animal models and in vitro systems, studies of environmental contamination by THS, human exposure studies, and priorities for further research. Future research must be conducted to facilitate hazard identification, and exposure and risk assessment to address its health effect on susceptible populations, such as pregnant women and children. In addition, policies and laws concerning tobacco smoke will need to be reviewed and possibly revised with the role of THS considered as an indispensable component of a broader tobacco control strategy in maternal and child health."

First, we investigated the irregular collapse characteristics of gamma ray and cut the non-ideal gamma response to improve the effectiveness of the standoff compensation error data. Effectiveness of detector combinations, density of borehole, and spine and ribs techniques from the modified standoff compensation data was analyzed. As the result of comparison, LSD-MSD combination has been suitable for standoff compensation more than LSD-SSD combination and it is possible to do standoff compensation for soil or weathered zone under groundwater level without fatal errors. Even though error scales of density transformed spine and ribs techniques were generally large compared to the conventional standoff compensation, standoff compensation for soil and weathered zone under groundwater level were sufficiently effective."
Participation of CCL1 in Snail-Positive Fibroblasts in Colorectal Cancer Contribute to 5-Fluorouracil/Paclitaxel Chemoresistance,2018,"['Colorectal neoplasms', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts', 'Snail', 'Multidrug resistance', 'CCL1']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) activated by cancer cells has a central role in development and malignant biological behavior in colorectal cancer (CRC). Adult fibroblasts do not express Snail, but Snail-positive fibroblasts are discovered in the stroma of malignant CRC and reported to be the key role to chemoresistance. However, the reciprocal effect of CAFs expressed Snail to chemoresistance on CRC cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully characterized.Materials and Methods Snail-overexpressed 3T3 stable cell lines were generated by lipidosome and CT26 mixed with 3T3-Snail subcutaneous transplanted CRC models were established by subcutaneous injection. Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry and western blotting assays were performed, and immunohistochemistry staining was studied. The cytokines participated in chemoresistance was validated with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and heatmap.Results Snail-expression fibroblasts are discovered in human and mouse spontaneous CRCs. Overexpression of Snail induces 3T3 fibroblasts transdifferentiation to CAFs. CT26 co-cultured with 3T3-Snail resisted the impairment from 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel in vitro. The subcutaneous transplanted tumor models included 3T3-Snail cells develop without restrictions even after treating with 5-fluorouracil or paclitaxel. Moreover, these chemoresistant processes may be mediated by CCL1 secreted by Snail-expression fibroblasts via transforming growth factor /nuclear factor-B signaling pathways.Conclusion Taken together, Snail-expressing 3T3 fibroblasts display CAFs properties that support 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel chemoresistance in CRC via participation of CCL1 and suggest that inhibition of the Snail-expression fibroblasts in tumor may be a useful strategy to limit chemoresistance."

It has been called the battle of Grunwald or Zalgiris or Tannenberg. It led in fact to a great political change in the East Central Europe. While the Union of Poland and Lithuania arose in coming centuries to the crucial power in the region, the Teutonic Order lost its role and was enforced to submit to the Polish king.This battle in the late middle age transformed itself to a eternal fight of memory in the formation of the modern national states in the 19th century. While the image of the Teutonic Order was reinterpreted as the martyrs for the Roman Church or as the heroic conquerors, the great battle was rewritten a part of the national history of each state. Nationalistic writers and historians represented the glorious past of the nation on the one hand, reflected their national suffering again on the other.The calling for historical memory depended on the political circumstance. Sometimes the symbol of Grunwald/Tannenberg would be called as ideological propaganda, sometimes as a part of the golden age which would provide national feeling for those who were suffering under foreign dominion. The second Grunwald was a dramatic result from such a conflict of memory. The German impetus caused immediately to the Polish reaction and the reciprocal confrontations often resulted in national ceremony or in building a place of remembrance. While the Poles made the battle a instrument for collective memory, the Lithuanians were sufficient to follow the polish model und to form a reactionary memory. Under Soviet Socialism Grunwald/Zalgiris was confined to a historical symbol for soviet solidarity with multinational members.Since the 1990s Grunwald gradually was transferred from the domain of national memory to the hands of historians. It would be indeed a proof which in Europe political swirls calm down and the discourse of nationalism is not in effect today. However, it seems to be too early to assert so now definitely."

In a narrative history on prisoners of the Korean War, the non-repatriated prisoners saw a prison camp as a ‘holy place of anti-communism,’ whereas it was recognized by the repatriated prisoners as the setting of an epic on ‘heroes who had resisted imperialism.’ These two prisoner groups of different natures had a completely different memory from each other. A collective memory was transformed into politics of memory. What does the existence of war prisoners really mean? The pictures of prisoners of the Korean War produced by the armed forces of Korea, the United States (navy, army and air forces), the United Kingdom and North Korea show us images of collective memories and transformed places. A photograph of prisoners offers a range of production data like basic information of five W's and one H, camera model and major parts (for example, film) and printing. Produced images hold memory and expansion effects, which vary depending on who classified, used or disposed of them in a which way for what purposes. Photographs of the Korean War have been metaphorically used in a variety of ways for a psychological warfare or politics, according to a nation or certain group's intentions. As a consequence, pictures of war prisoners have sometimes raised conflicts between generations or have been disregarded according to values the nation of the present or past commemorates.Keeping such a critical attitude in mind, this study attempted to find out the angles that soldier photographers had sought from the camera's viewfinder and the ways that an angle was caught on a subject and the subject was expressed. The U.S. Army's ‘criteria for classifying war prisoners’ had been applied in classifying the prisoners of the Korean War. These criteria for classifying prisoners are a racial or violent frame consisting of ‘Orient communists’ and ‘vicious reds/hardcore communists,’ which were suggested by the United Nations Forces and the Korean Army. This frame was valued for its utility in a psychological warfare for politics of memory. Four sequences can be generated from the classification of prisoners. The first scene is in a frame of race and violence. The photographs under the control of the U.S. Army, North Korean People’s Army or Chinese People's Volunteer Army demonstrate a cycle of violence as they were used in distinguishing or discriminating between the East and the West in accordance with slogans or policies such as ‘Orient communists’ and ‘American imperialist invaders.’ This corresponds to a double exposure consisting of race and violence. Such a double exposure is maximized between a prisoner and another, administrators and prisoners, and guards and prisoners in a prison camp or compound. The second scene is about a theory to produce ‘Orient communist’ prisoners. A prisoner who had been watched through a double exposure in the cycle of race and violence became a prisoner of a new category called transformed ‘vicious prisoners,’ which was like a birth of a new species. The pictures of prisoners taken by the photographers of the U.S. Army look as if the ‘vicious prisoners’ were conspiring to seize control of the prison camp by raising a ‘riot.’ The third scene is about ‘potential enemy’ and fellowship. Even though the war prisoners of the North Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were classified into a new category due to the principle of ‘voluntary repatriation’ and there was a ‘sense of fellowship’ between them and the Korean and U.S. Armies pursuant to the policies on war prisoners, they were treated as ‘potential enemies.’ Those people named ‘anticommunist prisoners’ were enemies invented or retrained by intelligence operations by the Korean ..."

Moreover, in the history of Korean stone stupas, the Five-storied Stone Stupa in Jeongnimsaji became the base for the birth of Silla’s typical stone stupas, and later, with the stone stupa of Baekje style that succeeds a unique group of stone stupas as a model, though not many, it has left traces behind on these stone stupas for a long time since the 9th century. The researcher could not but ask a question about why they adhered to the outward appearance of Five-storied Stone Stupa in Jeongnimsaji in the same region for such a long time in the process of investigating these stone stupas of Bekjae style.Thus, this study reorganized the existing data related to Five-storied Stone Stupa of Jeongnimsaji and found two facts that require attention in the process. One is that negative glass materials during the Japanese colonial period, concerning the stone stupa, which is the earliest investigation and Japanese scholars’ reports could be the grounds of the assumption of the repair of the stone stupas and the original form and transformation of the stone stupas at the time.

Varying upstream gate opening, flow rate and angle of the slope, a total of37 experimental cases were carried out. The experimental results are compared to two existing theories: an inviscid theory based onnonlinear shallow water equations and jump conditions and a hydraulic theory that takes friction into account. The experimental dataare consistent with the two theories. Flows on downward slope were stable, while those on upward slope had unstable hydraulic jumpand transformed into subcritical flow. The reported results should serve well in designing a laboratory flume with the supercriticalinflow and in conducting hydraulic model experiments on overbank flows."

Software-defined networking (SDN) being an emerging networking paradigm offers its services to program such cellular networks, providing a remotely configurable forwarding plane. This paper enlightens the notion of SDN in cellular multicast data transmission within eMBMS networks. It presents an objective sketch of transforming current multicast cellular communication into OpenFlow based SDN-evolved communication. We perform the first fine-grained analysis of common multicast procedures (group join, handover etc.) involved in both the current and SDN-evolved eMBMS network along with the supporting simulation results while providing multimedia services to the users. Considering user plurality of multicast services, we model the user requests as independent events of a Zipf-like distribution and find out the correlation among multimedia content popularity, operational load on the network and delay metrics. This paper provides a comparison of both the networks, summarizes the significant differences between the two, and highlights the effectiveness of our proposed SDN-evolved multicast approach in terms of minimized network operations, reduced delays, reliable and streamlined multicast tree construction.</P>"

The subjects ofthis study were the Spain-based Museo Guggenheim Bilbao and London-based Tate Modern Museum,which were the most typical synchronic museums built newly in the period spanning from late 1990sto early 21st century. Those museums were analyzed based on artistic and sociological approach toglolocalization and urban study, along with institutional criticism of museums. The phenomenologicalsubject model, pursued by minimalism, led to convergence between demands of urban tourismindustry aiming to promote experiences that could be gained in individual cities under global urbansystem and synchronic museums aiming to evolve into a huge scale. Under those circumstances, urbangovernments in the glocal era have planned the museums as strategic media that can be leveraged forurban branding, and in the process, the spectacular experiences gained during urban tours were foundto be being combined seamlessly with designs of museums serving as landmarks. Such emergence ofurban management led by owners of corporations fits well into the principle of experiential economythat sells the experiences, further spurring the shift of synchronic museums towards larger scale, whileserving as a network for establishment of branches of museums which connect the cities around theglobe.

Synergistic effects of simvastatin and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells on hepatic fibrosis,2018,"['Simvastatin', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Hepatic fibrosis', 'Liver regeneration']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The beneficial effects of simvastatin on fibrosis in various organs have been reported. In addition, bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested as an effective therapy for hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Recent evidence suggests that pharmacological treatment devoted to regulating stem cell function is a potential new therapeutic strategy that is drawing nearer to clinical practice. The aim of this study was to determine whether the combination treatment of simvastatin plus MSCs (Sim-MSCs) could have a synergistic effect on hepatic fibrosis in a thioacetamide (TAA)-induced cirrhotic rat model and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Cirrhotic livers from rats treated with Sim-MSCs exhibited histological improvement compared to those treated with simvastatin alone. Sim-MSCs combination treatment decreased hepatic collagen distribution, lowered the hydroxyproline content, and rescued liver function impairment in rats with TAA-induced cirrhosis. These protective effects were more potent with Sim-MSCs than with simvastatin alone. The upregulation of collagen-1, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and phospho-Smad3 in cirrhotic livers was prevented by the administration of Sim-MSCs. Intriguingly, Sim-MSCs inhibited both TGF-β/Smad3 signaling and α-SMA in HSCs. The Sim-MSCs combination treatment exerted strong protective effects against hepatic fibrosis by suppressing TGF-β/Smad signaling.

Environment Adaptive Localization Method Using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based fingerprinting techniques for indoor positioning can be readily implemented via a wireless access point. These methods have therefore been widely studied in the field of positioning. However, fingerprinting suffers low accuracy of positioning on account of high noise occurrences which are caused by other wireless communication signals and environmental factors when the RSSI is received, and by relatively high errors on account of low position resolution compared to other methods such as time of flight and inertial navigation technology. In this paper, a modified fingerprint algorithm based on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth low energy applied to the log-distance path loss model is proposed to remove unnecessary Wi-Fi data, and produce the AP database that can be updated depending on the changes of the ambient environment as the indoor area is increasingly complicated and extended. Instead of using the existing fingerprinting techniques of consulting signal strengths as factors that are stored in a database, the proposed algorithm employs environmental variables to which the log-distance path loss model is applied. Therefore, the proposed algorithm has higher position resolution than existing fingerprint and can improve the accuracy of positioning because of its low dependence on reference points. To minimize database and eliminate inaccurate AP signals, the Hausdorff distance algorithm and median filter are applied. Using a database in which environment variables are stored, the results are inversely transformed into the log-distance path loss model for expression as coordinates. The proposed algorithm was compared with existing fingerprinting methods. The experimental results demonstrated the reduction of positioning improvement by 0.695 m from 2.758 to 2.063 m.</P>"

In particular, the national employment strategy implemented in 2006 fundamentally was different from employment policy in the previous period. Therefore, we present that the effects of fiscal expenditures separated into before and after 2006 were estimated. And we compare and analyze these results. Moreover, to deal with endogeneity problems of using lagged variables as covariates, we estimate our model utilizing system GMM. We show results follow as: First, increasing national fiscal expenditures significantly affected on employment structure compared with regional fiscal expenditures. Second, fiscal expenditures is relevant to increasing irregular employment rather than regular employment. Futhermore, After 2006, when the employment strategy changed, the share of non-regular workers and self-employment is higher than that of regular workers on increasing national fiscal expenditures. It implies that fiscal expenditures with transformed employment strategy has a role in the change of employment structure."

From the view of system security and resource utility, higher resource sharing degree and higher system reliability can be obtained by the introduction of virtualization technology in distributed cloud. The small size time-sharing multiplexing technology which is based on virtual machine in distributed cloud platform can enhance the resource utilization effectively by server consolidation. In this paper, the concept of memory block and user satisfaction is redefined combined with user requirements. According to the unbalanced memory resource states and user preference requirements in multi-virtual machine environments, a model of proper memory resource allocation is proposed combined with memory block and user satisfaction, and at the same time a memory optimization allocation algorithm is proposed which is based on virtual memory block, makespan and user satisfaction under the premise of an orderly physical nodes states also.

The variations of these parameters cause different results in the formation of spherical BC and it is relevant to evaluate these effects. Carbon source, inoculum concentration, volume of the culture medium, stirring speed and incubation temperature were the processing parameters evaluated in this work. Therefore, the results obtained were characterized in terms of dry mass production, water uptake and sphericity of the spherical BC. To do so, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed as tools for morphological and chemical evaluations. Among the parameters analyzed, the carbon source had the greatest effect on the production of dry mass and water uptake. Glycerol had the greatest growing rate, generating a higher dry mass production with spherical and homogeneous bodies with excellent water absorption indexes. Furthermore, the morphological analysis of BC revealed a typical structure, with high crystallinity index and the presence of typical functional groups. These results indicate a path for the optimized and controlled production of spherical BC, allowing it to be used in many applications, such as enzyme immobilization, water treatment, bone regeneration, spherical cancer model, as adsorption agent and drug delivery."
"Reactions of Ferrate(VI) with Iodide and Hypoiodous Acid: Kinetics, Pathways, and Implications for the Fate of Iodine during Water Treatment",2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Oxidative treatment of iodide-containing waters can form toxic iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs). To better understand the fate of iodine, kinetics, products, and stoichiometries for the reactions of ferrate(VI) with iodide (I<SUP>-</SUP>) and hypoiodous acid (HOI) were determined. Ferrate(VI) showed considerable reactivities to both I<SUP>-</SUP> and HOI with higher reactivities at lower pH. Interestingly, the reaction of ferrate(VI) with HOI (<I>k</I> = 6.0 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> M<SUP>-1</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> at pH 9) was much faster than with I<SUP>-</SUP> (<I>k</I> = 5.6 × 10<SUP>2</SUP> M<SUP>-1</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> at pH 9). The main reaction pathway during treatment of I<SUP>-</SUP>-containing waters was the oxidation of I<SUP>-</SUP> to HOI and its further oxidation to IO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> by ferrate(VI). However, for pH > 9, the HOI disproportionation catalyzed by ferrate(VI) became an additional transformation pathway forming I<SUP>-</SUP> and IO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>. The reduction of HOI by hydrogen peroxide, the latter being produced from ferrate(VI) decomposition, also contributes to the I<SUP>-</SUP> regeneration in the pH range 9-11. A kinetic model was developed that could well simulate the fate of iodine in the ferrate(VI)-I<SUP>-</SUP> system. Overall, due to a rapid oxidation of I<SUP>-</SUP> to IO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> with short-lifetimes of HOI, ferrate(VI) oxidation appears to be a promising option for I-DBP mitigation during treatment of I<SUP>-</SUP>-containing waters.</P>[FIG OMISSION]</BR>"
Disease-specific impairment of the quality of life in adult patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria,2018,"['Urticaria', 'Chronic', 'Quality of life', 'Angioedema', 'Immunoglobulin E']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background/Aims: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin disorder characterized by wheals and pruritus lasting more than 6 weeks. Due to its long duration and changeable symptoms, the quality of life (QOL) of patients with CU can be impaired substantially. We evaluated the CU-QOL, a previously validated CU-specific QOL measure, and investigated factors influencing QOL in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) patients.Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was performed on 390 adult patients diagnosed with CSU from March 2009 to December 2012 at the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Clinic at Ajou University Hospital. The CU-QOL questionnaire, urticaria activity score (UAS), combined angioedema, and serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were investigated.Results: The average CU-QOL score obtained from the questionnaire was 70.6 (of 100 points). The CU-QOL scores correlated significantly with the UAS, particularly with the 15-point UAS (UAS-15; coefficient –0.532, p < 0.01) rather than the 6-point UAS (–0.502, p < 0.01). The patients presenting with angioedema and urticaria had poorer scores in the urticaria symptom domain than those with urticaria alone (37.4 vs. 46.9, p = 0.004). Log-transformed serum total IgE levels correlated significantly with CU-QOL (–0.131, p < 0.05). Multivariate regression models indicated that severe CU (UAS-15 score ≥ 13), log (total IgE), and the presence of angioedema were significant predictors of impaired CU-QOL (< 85 points).Conclusions: CU has a substantial negative impact on QOL. The assessment of UAS-15, total IgE, and the presence of angioedema can be useful to predict QOL of the patients with CSU."

Flux rope breaking and formation of a rotating blowout jet,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>We analysed a small flux rope eruption converted into a helical blowout jet in a fan-spine configuration using multiwavelength observations taken by Solar Dynamics Observatory, which occurred near the limb on 2016 January 9. In our study, first, we estimated the fan-spine magnetic configuration with the potential-field calculation and found a sinistral small filament inside it. The filament along with the flux rope erupted upwards and interacted with the surrounding fan-spine magnetic configuration, where the flux rope breaks in the middle section. We observed compact brightening, flare ribbons, and post-flare loops underneath the erupting filament. The northern section of the flux rope reconnected with the surrounding positive polarity, while the southern section straightened. Next, we observed the untwisting motion of the southern leg, which was transformed into a rotating helical blowout jet. The sign of the helicity of the mini-filament matches the one of the rotating jets. This is consistent with recent jet models presented by Adams et al. and Sterling et al. We focused on the fine thread structure of the rotating jet and traced three blobs with the speed of 60-120 km s(-1), while the radial speed of the jet is similar to 400 km s(-1). The untwisting motion of the jet accelerated plasma upwards along the collimated outer spine field lines, and it finally evolved into a narrow coronal mass ejection at the height of similar to 9R(sun). On the basis of detailed analysis, we discussed clear evidence of the scenario of the breaking of the flux rope and the formation of the helical blowout jet in the fan-spine magnetic configuration.</P>"

Image Stitching is a method for matching multiple images to produce a high resolution image and a wide field of view image. The image stitching is used in various fields beyond the limitation of images generated from one camera. Image Stitching detects feature points and corresponding points to match multiple images, and calculates the homography among images using the RANSAC algorithm. Generally, corresponding points are needed for calculating conversion relation. However, the corresponding points include various types of noise that can be caused by false assumptions or errors about the conversion relationship. This noise is an obstacle to accurately predict the conversion relation. Therefore, RANSAC algorithm is used to construct an accurate conversion relationship from the outliers that interfere with the prediction of the model parameters because matching methods can usually occur incorrect correspondence points. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that extracts more accurate inliers and computes accurate transformation relations by using correspondence point relation information used in RANSAC algorithm. The correspondence point relation information uses distance ratio between corresponding points used in image matching. This paper aims to reduce the processing time while maintaining the same performance as RANSAC."

NGI is noise free and grayscale, whereas the VCI has colors and contains noise. Moreover, there are significant edge and brightness discrepancies between NGI and VCI. In order to deal with this problem, a new transfer-based fusion method is proposed for noise removal. Different from conventional fusion approaches, the proposed method conducts a series of transfers, namely, contrast, detail, and color transfers. First, the proposed contrast and detail transfers aim at solving the serious discrepancy problem to create a new noise-free and detail-preserving NGI. Second, the proposed color transfer models the unknown colors from the denoised VCI through a linear transform, and then transfers the natural-looking colors into the newly generated NGI. The experimental results show that the proposed transfer-based fusion method is highly successful in solving the discrepancy problem.

東アジアの近現代都市,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"This article discusses common points and differences while comparing three cases that appeared in cities in modern East Asia (Northeast Asia / Southeast Asia).  First, in the late 19th century during the formation of a modern city, the shopouse was built. The shophouse was born in the 1820s by city planning conducted by T.Raffles in Singapore. Shophouse, which began as a typical colonial architecture, eventually spread to independent countries in East Asia. In Japan, the same style appeared in the Ginza brick district, but it was not a product of colonialism, but was strongly oriented towards modernization. However, shop houses did not spread to cities in Japan, and a new urban landscape was created while modernizing the style of traditional cities. In Bangkok, the shophouse was built in various places in the kings led modernization policy. Although it is modeled on colonial city Singapore and Batavia, it can be said that it is the result of a subjective modernization policy. Introduction of the shophouse as a nationalist modernization policy was also seen in China, “qilou (騎楼)” was born. It originated in Hong Kong which was a British colony, eventually Zhang Zhidong 張之洞, a Western-style bureaucrat also introduced to Guangzhou, then spread to each city in southern China.  Second, department stores were the symbol of consumption culture showing the transformation to modern cities in the first half of the 20th century. In Seoul, Keijo Mitsukoshi etc. were born and had functions as a recreation area with facilities such as large restaurants, fairgrounds, galleries and rooftop gardens. This is a style introduced in Japan, Mitsukoshi issued the “department store declaration”, followed by Japanesestyle department stores that have amusement facilities and enjoyed from adults to kids were born one after another. Similar phenomena also appeared in semi-colony China.

Besides department stores, contemporary urban spaces such as dance halls, cafes, movie theaters, etc. spread in the East Asian cities of the 1920’s and 30’s. Department stores in East Asia had different characteristics from the West. Besides department stores, contemporary urban spaces such as dance halls, cafes, movie theaters, etc. spread in the East Asian cities of the 1920’s and 30’s. However, we should not evaluate only aspects of “development” and “modernization” hastily, and consider its multifaceted elements.  Third, a case symbolizing the maturity of modern cities in the second half of the 20th century is the housing policy. Seoul forcibly removed the squatter, and the construction of a new city such as Seongnam 城南 (1973), Gwacheon 果川 (1986), Mokdong 木洞(1989) was promoted by the government and Public authority. The circumstances are different in China, and under the planned economy, state enterprises and others have provided everything from public services to daily necessities. When it became a socialist market economy after the 1990s, the construction of residential complexes progressed by private-sector developers led by the government. In Japan, unlike these, households of the middle class prefer a independent housing, and smallscale single-family homes of modern style increased by receiving loans such as Housing Loan Corporation (1950). In this way, in modern East Asian cities, although the contents and landscape are different, housing construction and urbanization have been promptly promoted on a policy basis."
"ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION LEADS TO ANOTHER: CONSUMERS’ PRIVACY CONCERN, TRUST AND THE TRAP OF WILLINGNESS TO SHARE INFORMATION",2018,"['privacy concern', 'trust', 'willingness to disclose information', 'sensitive and non-sensitive data', 'uncertainty avoidance']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We investigate the construct of privacy concern and its dimensions, together with its expected counterbalance, trust in the information collector, on willingness to disclose different information types to a digital seller in a multicountry study. This issue is critical, given the evolution of technologies that now allow for the collection and analysis of a huge amount of data. We conceptualise consumers’ privacy concerns as the extent to which a consumer is concerned about (Milberg, et al., 2000; Rose, 2006): (1) the general collection of personal information (data collection), (2) unauthorised secondary use (data secondary usage), (3) improper access (data access) and (4) errors (data accuracy). The first contribution of our research is that we will verify the validity of the four dimensions of information privacy concern in a multiple-country study. We then develop a model by testing the impacts of privacy concern and trust on the willingness to disclose sensitive and non-sensitive information. First, our results validate the privacy concern scale based on the four dimensions (data collection, data secondary usage, data access and data accuracy) in eight countries and show that information disclosure can contain an inner trap based on customer training to disclose information that may transform information disclosure in an habit that increases willingness to share that may overcome the effects of privacy concern and trust on customers’ intended behaviours, opening possibilities of potential harmful behaviours on the part of companies to get data from their prospects that should be carefully monitored and managed."

The objectives of the Housing Action Trusts will be: to take over local authority housing within the designated area; to repair, modernize and improve the stock; to improve the living conditions and general environment of the area; to secure diversity of tenure.  The local authorities and estate tenants first opposed the framework for HATs when it was established under the Housing Act of 1988 on grounds that it was over-centralized. This failure transformed HAT policy from a centralized agency model to a partnership model, based on partnership with local authorities and tenants. Nowadays, HAT policy has three special features: (1) the remarkable approaches to tenants’participation in HAT projects; (2) the multi-focused approach to regeneration in deprived estates and neighborhoods; (3) the ample funds available for projects.  The lessons in regeneration from HAT policy, especially the tackling of wider social and economic problems of their neighborhoods and the governance system of HAT that discourages moral hazards of regeneration, can be transferable to regeneration of Korean public estates. The paper is based on interviews and on-site inspection at Liverpool HAT.  The article briefly profiles the Liverpool HATs’ designated areas, then assesses the degree to which it has achieved its main objectives. The HAT has thus far had mixed success. It has attached greater priority to employment and training and quality of life measures, community empowerment and sustainability than earlier estate regeneration programmes. However, it has still devoted the lion’s share of its resources to housing investment and the question remains whether it has gone far enough in tackling the deep-rooted social and economic problems of deprived neighborhoods. I do not doubt that this article will have a great impact on Korea’s urban regeneration project."

Amid these transformations, generation shift of creative directors is one of the possible solutions to them. Fashion house Balmain is referred to as a typical example that enjoys a heyday through generation replacement, escaping from threat of fall. This study aims at finding out characteristics of fashion house Balmain that Olivier Rousteing has set up. As a research method, literature screening was performed on fashion house Balmain and Olivier Rousteing’s fashion world and study carried out about fashion communications that Rousteing developed in Balmain from 2012 S/S to 2017 F/W. Fashion communications were divided into fashion collection, ad campaign, social media and collaboration and among which fashion collection was confined to woman costume and then such design characteristics were analyzed as seasonal concept and style, format, item, color, material, pattern and ornamental technique.  Study resulted as follows. Fashion collection panned out mainly with a concept of pop emotion and reinterpretation of the 1980s. For example, such images showed as accent on slim waist and shoulder, body-conscious line stressing on woman’s body volume, application of various colors and materials, splendid and sexy feature with ornamental details. Advertisement campaign picked up different racial models, pop stars and conveyed the differentiated images so that all women could enjoy the luxurious emotions through collaboration. Also, social media was actively used to share and communicate with the public all the images of designer’s individual life style and things pertaining to the house.  The feature drawn from this research is as follows. First, it is glam couture oriented, based on pop. It builds up a new heyday of Balmain converged with couture house tradition and splendid pop emotion. Second, it seeks for the value of diversity and integration. Democratic view is available through the selection of diverse racial fashion models, the aggressive communication and cooperation with the public by Instagram. Third, it is the construction of powerful and sexy feminity. Self-confidence in energetic modern woman is reflected by glamorousness with volumetric stress like girl crush image and this is structured with symbolic feminity of house.   This research helped to examine how a new designer who inherited the traditional fashion house built up the value of innovation and to look into creative thought on fashion in response to the fluctuating fashion environment."

This project lasted from October to December of 2017 in involved basic coding-decoding applications and finishing phases in the classroom. The project was carried out in an area between the old Gwana Park in Chungju-si and a youth mall where youth businesses are started. The purpose of the project was to improve the environment of the community by developing programs related to the majors of the students, aiming to develop programs through their major classes and improve the environment of the local community through them. A mural project was conducted in Chungju-si, with residents attempting to transform their areas into more youthful areas in order to find local vitality. One educational effect was not only to realize the project in a step-by-step manner in the sixteen-week program but also to apply theories learned in the classroom on site and to contribute to the local area. There are many studies of mural paintings in the existing research on public arts, but mainly focus on analyzing mural projects and on case studies involving resident participation. It is true that the former type of research collects objective data and undertakes theoretical analyses, but it is limited because regional studies are not applied equally. In this respect, the present study presents an education methodology and offers significance given the combination of a major education program and a local connection. I also introduced the concept of state discrimination when applying the content to the class. Hence, I hope that this study will become a practical educational model for professors, teachers, students, and local community members who carry out community-related projects in connection with college classes in the future."

In the meantime, various policies have been drafted and implemented in universities with a focus on the school age population, Nevertheless, there have been few policies that provide higher education benefits to adult learners. However, assuming that education is the most optimal system for the development of human resources and the knowledge economy, it is imperative that local residents and adult learners develop themselves and acquire knowledge and skills through higher education.Continuing Higher Education has been expanding and developing, and recently the government has been supporting it with huge budgets. With this in mind, this paper has explored the evolution, practices, and challenges on continuing higher education in Korea. As a result, it has learned that continuing higher education policies have revealed various problems and development tasks.Therefore, 'University Lifelong Education Policy' centered on degree programs should be transformed into 'College Lifelong Education Ecosystem Policy' which includes non-formal and informal education for lifelong learning. Furthermore, the government's policy to support university lifelong education should allocate the budget equally to both the degree and non-degree programs. In addition, this budget should be shifted to an infrastructure support project for the development of adult learners' capacity and the creation of lifelong learning ecosystems at universities for the  connection with the community. University lifelong learning policies can also be maximized when implemented with a monitoring system supported with a budget allocated by a long-term development plan road map which is set by vision, purpose, goals, strategy and performance task."

First of all, I identify artificial intelligence(AI) automation as the core of scientific and technological change. In the process, this study pays a special attention to Paul Krugman’s diagnosis that the AI automation result in capital-biased technological change in the socioeconomic system and the world of labor. The reason is that AI automation is replacing not only manual labor but the human brain with a machine in the production of goods and service. Since automation of production facilities requires enormous capital and does not require human labor anymore, education in the past era that have solved the problem of inequality has no choice but to lose strength. In this situation, this study sees the inequalities deepened by technological progress as a great challenge. On the other hand, the emergence of a sharing economy that co-evolves with digital technology is considered an opportunity. On this basis, I argue that current history requires us to have a wisdom which makes technological progress bring about social progress. An example of such wisdom is Bernard Stiegler, who argues that digital technology is a pharmakon that could be a benefit (medicine) or a harm (poison). He proposes to build a new economic model based on the recovery of ‘work’, which ends capitalist employment for income only and gives meaning to life. This model asks us to shift the focus of our education from economic value to social value. Therefore, I suggests that what we have to do to realize this socioeconomic change and value transformation should be to return to the foundations of wisdom and knowledge we have accumulated. I concluded this study by discussing how to implement such claims in our higher education."

The subjects of discussion are Fukujawa Yukichi (1834-1901) in Japan, and Lee Neung-hwa (1869-1943) in Korea. Japan and Korea similarly experienced the introduction to Western civilization in earnest between the late 19<SUP>th</SUP> century and the early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century. Compared to the existing world view that prevailed in East Asia, a new and strange world view that originated from Western civilization suddenly appeared. When thinking about the theme of the modernization of Silhak, we should be attentive to the issue of how a new world view was established against the backdrop of an existing world view. Because in this paper the concept of modernization means not only the modernization brought about by the influence of Western civilization, but also the indigenous modernization that might have progressed before the introduction of Western civilization.  If the conclusion is announced in advance, it can be stated as follows. Fukujawa Yukichi separated himself from the existing world view that prevailed in East Asia, and embraced the mechanistic world view that stemmed from the birth of scientific inquiry in the West. On the other hand, Lee Neung-hwa inherited those attitudes based on documental archaeology and eclectic study that Silhak in East Asia featured, and at the same time was able to make sense of Western civilization that he came into contact with.  To Fukujawa Yukichi, who embraced the mechanistic world view, Silhak meant just a ‘science.’ The science he meant was general ‘science’ that included not only the natural science of today, but also social science and humanistic science, and the model was physics. In this world view that can be said to adopt a mechanical view of nature that had originated from Rene Descartes, nature existed as an object that is to be manipulated by human beings. And the operating principle was based on physics. Fukujawa comprehended civilization as a science based on such a mechanistic view of nature and its practical development. Seen from this view point, it was not necessary to look back on the existing East Asian science and world view. In addition, in Fukujawa’s understanding about Silhak, as well as with regard to existing learning such as Confucianism and national study, religions such as Christianity did not have an active meaning or relevance. This was because they only possessed value as a tool to maintain the social order.  Lee Neung-hwa, who was born one generation later than Fukujawa, can be named as someone who represents the beginning period of Silhak study in modern Korea. Lee Neung-hwa thought that, as the Godism (Sin’gyo) of Ancient Joseon had gone through a transformation into diverse gods, the spiritual basis had been prepared among the public to accept Christianity, and, furthermore, Christianity had developed into the theory of ‘mind and body’ of Buddhism. So taking the Buddhism as the pinnacle, all religions were understood as the process of reaching Buddhism. Practically, Lee Neung-hwa collected and arranged all religious materials with the attitude of seeking to incorporate and penetrate all religions. In addition, he was disposed to highly regard the medical practices of ancient Godism, and further understood the theory of four types, which deals with the relation between the body and mind could be invented due to the process of the development of the medicine of ancient Godism. This attitude of Lee Neung-hwa can be compared to the attitude of Fukujawa regarding modernization."

Six athletes who have been competing for 4 to 6 years with outstanding records from domestic competitions and their two coaches were selected using a purposive sampling technique. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, participant observation, and training notes, which then were analysed by the Dey’s method (1993). There were three chronological stages in a successful adaptation process of adolescent dance sport athletes: the Assimilation Period, the Changing Period, and the Adaptation Period. During the Assimilation Period, when the athletes assimilated to the characteristics and values of their training group, they ‘found the right direction in life’by meeting other's expectations and by expanding their career path. During the Changing Period, the athletes experienced physical, psychological and social changes, and they went through ‘a series of chaotic daily routines’ with uncontrollable mind and body, agonized by tedious and painful training sessions. During the Adaptation Period, the athletes transformed themselves in an effort to move toward the ultimate collective goal, continuously making negotiations and compromises’ in their routines, which included setting up manageable standards and time frames. These findings suggest an ideal model for a successful adaptation process, a barometer which can be referred to by adolescent dance sport athletes, their coaches, their parents, and the organizations they belong to."

We should be open to the concept of “from traditional church leadership to new paradigm leadership” when cultural situations are changing. The purpose of this article is to investigate what is the desirable model of missional pastoral leadership. First, I explore the transformation of churches in the world with a view to new leadership paradigm. This study then focuses on what kind of pastoral leadership is needed when transforming missional churches. Pastoral leadership is further explained concerning how to build up people of God within missional churches. The church is called to serve the world as a missional community in which God’s people take up an incarnational leadership, a servant leadership, and a cross leadership within the world."

The two title compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pnma (Pearson code oP16, Z = 4) with six crystallographically independent asymmetric atomic sites and adopt the Gd5Si4-type structure. Overall crystal structures of two isotypic title compounds can be described as a 1:1 assembly of the hypothetical 2-dimensional (2D) RE2(RE/Li)(In/Ge)2 layered structure adopting the Mo2FeB2-type structure and the dumbbell-shaped inter-slab (In/Ge)2 dimers bridging two such neighboring 2D layers along the crystallographic b-axis direction. The observed ?direction selective? structural transformation from the Sm5Ge4-type to the Gd5Si4-type structure can be understood as a result of the simultaneous double-doping by the relatively smaller amount of Li substitution for La at the RE3 site than that in the La4LiGe4 and the partial In substitution for Ge at both of the M1 and M3 sites. The site-preference of In for two particular anionic sites were thoroughly studied using four hypothetical La4LiGe3In models having different atomic arrangements by the tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital (TB-LMTO) method. The overall electronic structure and individual chemical bonding influenced by the given double-doping were also discussed on the basis of the density of states (DOS) and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) curves analyses."

There is no liberal arts college in Korea with its original literal meaning. Absence of liberal arts college has incurred distortion and deadlock in ecosystem of higher education. State should serve as a driver for characterization and diversification of universities through their functional differentiation and division of role. It is necessary to seek for establishing ‘national liberal arts college’ in order to settle general education paradigm focusing on the humanities and basic sciences.  Significance of liberal arts colleges is identified through cases of US’s top ranked liberal arts colleges that are educationally competitive in spite of global crisis of liberal arts education; Yale-NUS College that promotes global diffusion of liberal arts college model; Akita International University in Japan which is a transformed liberal arts college, etc. National liberal arts college is to build up an ideal model for Korean liberal arts education. It is national efforts to revive moribund general education and to promote the humanities and basic sciences withering into insignificance. It aims for balanced development of general education and major coursework; doubling of synergy among the humanities and basic sciences and applied sciences and; healthy ecosystem between national and private universities.

Methods: RNA-seq data was used to identify the panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly related with percentage and diameter of each fiber type (I, IIA, IIB). Detected polymorphisms were mapped to quantitative trait loci (QTLs) regions. Next, the association study was performed on 944 animals representing five breeds (Landrace, Large White, Pietrain, Duroc, and native Puławska breed) in order to evaluate the relationship of selected SNPs and histological characteristics, meat quality and carcasses traits. Results: Mapping of detected genetic variants to QTL regions showed that chromosome 14 was the most overrepresented with the identification of four QTLs related to percentage of fiber types I and IIA. The association study performed on a 293 longissimus muscle samples confirmed a significant positive effect of transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein 2 (TACC2) polymorphisms on fiber diameter, while SNP within forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) locus was associated with decrease of diameter of fiber types IIA and IIB. Moreover, subsequent general linear model analysis showed significant relationship of FOXO1, delta 4-desaturase, sphingolipid 1 (DEGS1), and troponin T2 (TNNT2) genes with loin 'eye' area, FOXO1 with loin weight, as well as FOXO1 and TACC2 with lean meat percentage. Furthermore, the intramuscular fat content was positively associated (p<0.01) with occurrence of polymorphisms within DEGS1, TNNT2 genes and negatively with occurrence of TACC2 polymorphism. Conclusion: This study's results indicate that the SNP calling analysis based on RNA-seq data can be used to search candidate genes and establish the genetic basis of phenotypic traits. The presented results can be used for future studies evaluating the use of selected SNPs as genetic markers related to muscle histological profile and production traits in pig breeding."

An Android is a robot that looks and moves exactly like a human. Thus, an Android must possess sensibility to detect subtle mood changes in the person it faces. Are these Androids simply ‘born’ machines? Do they remain as ‘fake humans’ because, while they are similar to humans, they do not attain the wholeness of humanness? Are they merely marionettes that reflect the interests of the robot scientists’ collective? Or are they bodies that multiplex humanness? This study is an experiment that explores the potential ‘humanness of something that is not a human but is like a human’ through the aforementioned questions.This experiment of the Android’s humanness explores how the so–called elements pertaining to man’s mind or culture, such as feelings, consideration, sociality, and morality are embodied in the Android and comprise the Android’s perspective. Further, the experiment allows for the world in which the Android lives in to be deployed from its perspective.First, I explore the discussions of sense as a long continuum emergingfrom vague feeling to perception, in order to extract the key elements of the Android’s sensory process. Secondly, I consider the installation of a sensor on the Android and the aesthetic judgement made in the process of treating the data produced through the sensor. Thirdly, I discuss the different aspects of sense as revealed through sensibility, intelligence and consciousness, as part of the transformation and production process of sensibility. Fourthly, I discuss how the various models constituting the actions of the Android are mobilized from fields like psychology, cognitive science and linguistics, which have hitherto studied mankind; in addition, the modulation process by which these models are ordered according to the sequential actions of the Android are considered here.

Discourse is divided into two types: conversation and conversation. In the case of dialogue, if the listener is mainly used to express the wishes of the marriage to the female ladies and qualities of the family, the use of various devices other than dialogue is to make the listener to the general public It can be confirmed that it is utilized. It means that the purpose of the waterway is different from that of the waterway, so the different ways of using the discourse are different and the method chosen accordingly. The psychological meaning revealed in the discourse contains the intention to explore the ideal self image. In the process of religious reflection and training, Suiun considers human beings to internally exercise and what ideal situation should be reached. The pursuit of this idealistic self-image resembles the mental aspect of the human general because it is in line with the universal growth process of human beings in terms of psychoanalysis. The image of the ideal self includes not only the meaning of searching for a model of one ‘s ideal, but also the question of how to set and adjust the part of self which overlaps with others in ideal form. The ideal of this type of self and the others is transformed into the image of the other person, and what kind of ideal the other should have is the search for the humanoid type. The humanoid soul searching and souring is not only a passive idea, but an active subject. It is also the result of the hope of Suwoon that the ideal person would go up to the class of harvesting Donghak and occupy the center of the world. In other words, in the future, Suwoon is projecting the dream that the subjective and practical human image with the ideology of Donghak is the mainstream of society and they want to lead the world in the future."

According to Calvin, the best way to resemble the God is doing good. The basic value of Christian social welfare is to restore the lost image of the God. The restoration of the lost image of the God enables us to do good and to transform the capitalistic society based on egoism into another alternative capitalistic society with human face born again with the image of the God. In this way, it can lead us to build up the fusion society with the mixed characteristics of Geselschaft and the Gemeinschaft.  When we love our neighbors, we must perform self-denial first, that is ‘first self-denial and then doing good.’ If we deny ourselves, we cannot disparage welfare recipients, but treat them with cruelty and stigmatize them. Also we should be able to show empathy, which is the ability to put oneself into another’s shoes. It is not their wrongdoing that the rich lives a more affluent life than the poor on the condition under which the rich helps the poor and so does not make other people lose their footings. Thus, Calvin supports the social welfare regime based on capitalism, which seeks to accomplish distributive justice and the alleviation of the gap between the rich and the poor.   The rich and the poor each are endowed with functions by the God. The rich are givin the role and the obligation to distribute to the poor the gifts given by the God and to support the poor. The poor are given the role to be agents of Christ, receivers of the God and watchmen of the God. From the perspective of functionalism, if the rich and the poor play their own role faithfully, Christian community regains balance, maintains peace and grows. God establishes states to notify Himself. Thus states should become value vanguards to keep the God’s will, as well as church supporters, peace keepers of societies, and the instrument to accomplish civil justice. However, the state should not be a power state or warfare state but democratic welfare state. Also, there should be a collaborative relationship between churches and states in carrying out social welfare, that is welfare governance. Calvin supports the inclusive welfare systems which deny social exclusion, thus pursuing social integration."
Effect of Sodium Tripolyphosphate on Clay Tolerance of Polycarboxylate Superplasticizer,2018,"['polycarboxylate superplasticizer', 'montmorillonite', 'sodium tripolyphosphate', 'intercalation', 'clay tolerance']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"High fluidity concrete has been widely used in modern civil engineering project to ensure that the highly efficient construction process canbe achieved. Generally, the fluidity can be obtained with the incorporation of superplasticizer system composed of polymers and retarders.Sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), a commonly used retarder in cement-based material, can obviously increase the dispersion ofpolycarboxylate superplasticizer (PCE), and this has been widely employed in real concrete. However, the effect of STPP on clay toleranceof PCE has not been confirmed until now, and it is still uncertain whether STPP in PCE system has positive or negative effect on workabilityof fresh concrete with poor-quality aggregates containing montmorillonite (Mt) which is one of the most harmful clay minerals. In this study,the effect of STPP on fluidity of cement-Mt paste with PCE has been investigated. The fluidity was tested with mini slump to assess the claytolerance of PCE. The adsorption amount of PCE and STPP in Mt suspension was tested with total organic carbon analyzer and inductivecoupled plasma emission spectrometer to characterize the adsorption behavior. The interlayer spacing was evaluated with X-rayDiffractometer and the structure of intercalated Mt by PCE was characterized with Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer and thermogravimetric analyzer, and these results were used to illustrate the effect of STPP on intercalation of PCE. Finally, the dispersion model wasproposed to reveal the mechanism behind. The results show that STPP can disperse the Mt particles and increase adsorption amount of PCEin Mt suspension, thereby accelerating rather than hindering the intercalation of PCE into Mt. The fluidity of cement-Mt paste with PCESTPPsystem is depended on the added dosage of STPP: with the dosage less than 0.20%, the contribution of STPP to dispersing the cementparticles predominates, hence increasing the fluidity of the paste and improving the clay tolerance; while with the dosage more than 0.20%,the acceleration of the intercalation of PCE resulting from STPP becomes predominant, thereby reducing the fluidity of the paste. This resultcan provide useful experience for the improvement in clay tolerance of PCE in real concrete with poor aggregate containing Mt."

However, nearly no domestic studies have proactively introduced the concept of time to leadership research. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive review of relevant studies that were recently published in top-tier international journals in order to call for attention of Korean researchers to the topic. The 38 studies included in this review are categorized into 5 sub-topics. The first group of studies focus on temporal leadership, referring to leaders’ behaviors actively managing time, and its influence on team performance. The second group of studies investigate how leaders appropriately modify behavioral patterns as time passes by, and how such behavioral changes influence team performance. The third sub-topic is leadership development in which longitudinal studies have investigated the development of leadership skills and identity as a leader over time. Studies on the influences of experiences and personal traits of the childhood and of previous leaders on leadership in adulthood are also included in this category. Fourth are studies on leadership succession which examine how similarity/contrast between former and new leaders, leader-member exchange (LMX) between a former leader and team members, personal attributes of a new leader affect the outcomes of leadership transition. Finally, several longitudinal studies examining how transformational leadership, leaders’ mental models, the relationship between leadership and organizational climate and LMX change over time are included in this review. The studies included in this review provide in common various novel insights that have not been identified in the leadership literature without the perspective of time, and emphasize the importance of adopting the lens of time to the leadership research.Key words: leadership, time, temporal leadership, leadership development, leadership succession"

With the plague in Taiwan, the Japanese government sent medical professors and soldiers from Tokyo Imperial University College of Medicine to Taiwan instead of sending out Kitasato Shibasaburo(1852-1931), which had been controversial with the plague's dyeing method. They found out about the verification of Kitasato’s faults, and the transmission of plague by rat fleas. The Japanese government accumulated the knowledge needed in Imperial medicine through research activities in Taiwan. But knowledge of imperialism was not immediately implemented or utilized in the colonies. Since the plague epidemic in Taiwan, the Contagious Disease Prevention Rule in Taiwan included plague ahead of Japan in 1896. Goto Shimpei(1857-1929), who took office as the head of the Taiwan Government General's Civil Affairs Bureau, opposed to extensionism, and sought to actively utilize autonomous organizations such as Baojia(a community based self defense and autonomous system). Goto no longer clung to idealistic quarantine policies, wanted to strengthen the authority of the Government-General in Taiwan and face up to the reality of the colony.Goto and Kitasato are important people who can explain the growth of Imperial medicine. Goto led the administration of hygiene in the Empire and the colony by serving as the Minister of Internal Affairs and Taiwan's Minister of Public Affairs and Government, while Kitasato is a world-renowned bacteriologist representing Japan, accumulating knowledge of Japan and the colony. In the 1870s in Japan, Goto proposed a “health police doctor,” a prototype of a sanitary police, and proposed an ideal model with professional knowledge. But in the colonial Taiwan, Goto tried to build a social system with Baojia system under police command. Kitasato faced the danger of being kicked out of the scientific community because of his desire to earn the reputation of being the first plague-discover, but was back in the field due to his ability to contribute to the spread and spread of bacterial knowledge. It is true, however, that Kitasato played a leading role in the establishment and development of the first knowledge, but the knowledge was not one-way to the home country and the colonies. Kitasato was constantly in competition with medical researchers from Tokyo Imperial University, and he had to continue to compete and compromise in colonial quarantine and real politics. The knowledge of the empire's medicine surrounding the plague remained likely to be transformed and refracted in the competition with colonial medicine."

Specifically, the authors suggested the following three major points. First, the roles of leader traits which consisted of proactive personality, social skill and achievement striving were studied to multi-foci issue leadership (issue creation, audience involvement, issue implementation). Second, the impacts of issue leadership (issue creation, audience involvement, issue implementation) were verified to organizational effectiveness (creative behavior, issue helping behavior, job performance) with the multi-foci perspective. Third, mediating mechanisms by multi-foci issue leadership were demonstrated in the links between leader traits (proactive personality, social skill and achievement striving) and organizational effectiveness (creative behavior, issue helping behavior, job performance) in all path respectively.  In order to investigate the hypothesized model, the date was based on off-line survey which set a pair measured by a leader and by a follower each in order to minimize common method bias. The research target that have worked at hotel and service industry located in Seoul and Jeju island was 400 of pairs. However 366 of pairs questionnaires were collected, the completed validated data was 330 of pairs. It was applied for the analysis. In the process of data collection, leaders were clearly marked with team leader or managers to get rid of illusion between team leaders and superiors. Considering the primary purposes of the present research, the procedure of analysis was conducted with SPSS package and Process Macro which is utilized in multiple mediation analysis and is enable to support the significance of indirect effects by bootstrapping.  The results are follows. First, leader traits (proactive personality, social skill and achievement striving) were positively related to subconcept of issue leadership (issue creation, audience involvement, and issue implementation) in each path respectively. Second, all impacts of issue leadership (issue creation, audience involvement, and issue implementation) to organizational effectiveness (creative behavior, issue helping behavior, and job performance) with multi-foci path were statistically significant as we expected. Third, mediating effects in each mechanism through multi-foci issue leadership (issue creation, audience involvement, issue implementation) were significantly mediated in the links between leader traits (proactive personality, social skill and achievement striving) and organizational effectiveness (creative behavior, issue helping behavior, and job performance) in all mechanism.  These empirical results advance to understand importance for a type of leader traits that facilitate a subconcept of issue leadership. In addition, the discriminative roles of issue leadership constructs to organizational effectiveness were found. It contributes to expand research area of issue leadership. The mediating mechanisms by issue leadership in the multi-foci approach were suggesting for a new approach in leadership studies composed of multiple subconcept. Moreover, this paper suggested new effe"
A Study on Factors Influencing the TERRORIST Damage : Focusing on the Mediating Effect of Ripple Effect,2018,"['Terrorism', 'Ripple Effect', 'Poverty', 'Ideology', 'Terrorist Damage']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study attempted to analyze the main causes of terrorist incidents. The purpose of this study is to see how it affects terrorist attacks. In particular, this study focused on Ripple Effect. The factors that can be identified before the terrorist attacks were classified as One Ripple Effect as it can detect the phenomenon before the terrorist attacks. These processes would be able to respond in a precise way to reduce terrorist damage. The result of analysis showed that ideology and poverty of the country were not the factors that raised the level of terror damage. Thus, it was confirmed that the damage was increased in the case of Ripple Effect. This was a natural consequence. However, this study could suggest that the variables constructed to identify the ripple effect were measured as identifiable factors before the terrorist attacks, so that prompt and precise responses were required under the same circumstances. This study used Global Terrorism Data(GTD) for research analysis. Data was analyzed from 2014 to 2016, and the raw data was used. In order to measure the independent variables that this study wanted to check, variables were transformed and used in analysis. The independent variables used for this analysis were Ideology, Ripple Effect, and Money Demand. In addition, the dependent variable was used as a damage that combines the wounded and Kills (including terrorists) in the event of terrorism. In the final model, the Money Demand variable was not regularized and was excluded. It is the limit of this study that the poverty of the country is to be confirmed through Money Demand. However, it is clear from the point of view that the demand for money is a proof of poverty, and that the research has proceeded. In conclusion, even in the case of terrorism based on ideology and national poverty, there should be a more precise response to the reduction of damage in the situation where Ripple Effect is predicted. The variables that make up the Ripple Effect include political objectives, message delivery, and terrorist targets. Therefore, even though we did not control many variables, it can be based on the fact that concrete action should be prepared in a situation where there is a concern about ripple effect."
집합행위와 감정 집합적 분노는 언제 왜 폭력적으로 표출되는가,2018,"['Collective action', 'Emotion', 'Resentment', 'Resistant violence', 'State violence', 'Emotional sociology', '집합행위', '감정', '분노', '저항 폭력', '국가 폭력', '감정사회학']","일부 논자들은 비폭력적 집합행위를 목도하고 그 원인으로 ‘시민의식의 성숙’을 들고 있다. 이 설명은 일견 타당해보이기도 하지만, 이 설명을 뒤집으면 과거 우리 사회뿐만 아니라 세계사에서 역사적 변화의 중심 동력이 되었던, 폭력행위를 포함한 집합행위들은 극단적으로는 무분별한 폭도의 행동이었는가하는 의문이 제기될 수도 있다. 이럴 경우 폭도들이 인류의 역사발전을 이끌었다는 역설이 발생하게 된다. 이러한 역설이 발생하게 된 까닭은 분노는 부정적 감정이고 따라서 폭력적 분출과 같은 부정적 결과를 산출한다는 단순 논리적 선입견이 자리하고 있기 때문이다. 이 연구는 집합행위에서 감정이 어떤 경우에 폭력적으로 표출되는지, 그리고 그 폭력적 분출은 어떻게 감정적으로 해석되고 의미를 부여받는지를 이론적으로 탐구한다.이를 위해 먼저 집합행위에서 감정이 어떻게 다루어져왔는지를 군중이론의 전통, 합리주의적 접근방식(자원동원이론과 정치과정이론), 감정사회학적 관점으로 나누어 살펴본다. 둘째, 분노가 집합행위로 분출되는 감정동학을 분노의 원인과 분노의 표출방향과 관련하여 살펴보고, 집합행위는 사회적·정치적 분노가 외사되고 사회적·정치적 적대감으로 전화되어 집단적으로 표출될 때 발생함을 규명한다. 셋째, 분노감정이 집합행위에서 폭력적 분출로 이어지는 경우를 저항자들의 분노강화 전략과 국가 행위자들의 공포 조장하기 전략이 충돌하는 지점에서 발생한다는 점을 이상형적 모델을 통해 도출한다. 마지막으로, 결론에서는 집합행위에서 폭력이 감정적·도덕적으로 승화되는 방식을 추적함으로써, 국가폭력과는 달리 저항폭력이 역사적 의미를 획득하게 되는 근거를 밝힌다.","Some commentators ascribe nonviolent collective action to the ‘maturity of citizen consciousness’. While this explanation seems valid at first sight, if we put it reversely, a question may be raised that collective actions, including violent acts, which have been in the past the driving force of historical change not only in Korean society but also in the world history, were unreasonable mob behaviors. If so, it gives rise to the paradox that mobs have led the development of human history. The paradox occurs because of the simple logical preconception that resentment is a negative emotion and thus generates negative results such as its violent eruption. This study explores theoretically when emotions are expressed violently in collective action and how a violent eruption is interpreted emotionally and given a meaning.For this purpose, I firstly examine how emotion in collective action has been studied in the tradition of crowd theory, the rationalist approach (resource mobilization theory and political process theory), and the perspective of emotional sociology. Secondly, I look into the emotional dynamics of resentment being expressed as collective action in relation with the cause of resentment and the direction of its expression, and explicate that collective actions occur when social and political resentments are projected externally and transformed into social and political hostilities, which are then vented out collectively. Thirdly, using an ideal‒type model, I draw the idea that resentments in collective actions lead to a violent eruption at a point where the resistants’ strategy to reinforce resentment clashes with the state actors’ strategy to foster anxiety. Finally, in conclusion, I elucidate the ground that resistant violence, unlike state violence, attains a historical significance by examining how the violence in collective action is sublimed emotionally and morally."

Since the 1920s, this system has also been established by a number of continental law countries and regions. In terms of the trust legislation of these continental law countries and regions, it is very distinctive compared with the British and American trust legislation in terms of both model and content. The unique system structure and function of trust have been in accordance with the needs of China's contemporary society for property management and long-term financing. Property transformation and property management are the basic function of trust which promote financing, capital accumulation and social welfare and so on. our country has entered the real economy, intellectual property and financial and economic era. The development of modern society is far beyond the category of the original property law adjustment, so our property law system should match with the actual economic development in our country. This paper makes an empirical study of the limitations of the traditional “property and obligation dichotomy system”, which leads to the disorientation of the beneficial right of trust in judicial practice. There are some defects in China's trust legislation concerning the classification of property rights and the regulation of trust industry. Behind these defects lies the conflict between the traditional concept of “property and obligation dichotomy system” in civil law and the trust system. Failure to actively coordinate or even ignore such institutional conflicts is not only detrimental to the unification of the legal system, but also inevitable to eliminate the positive functions of the trust system. The property right of trust is a kind of intangible property, which consists of the Client's right of supervision, the trustee's right of management and the beneficiary's right of interest.

This type of shopping is alluded to as retail therapy or retail therapy. Retail therapy or compensatory consumption is frequently connected in the observation to brighten oneself up through the buy of self-treats and additionally lacking self. The significance of the study is to identify the factors influencing the consumption behaviour among women with reference to retail therapy. Most of the research in this area belongs to socio-psychology, psycho-sociology and clinical psychology. The concrete and crystallized conceptual framework in the field of consumer research is very few. The complex theoretical background which lacks unified conceptual framework. Thus, the present research aims to understand the influence of selfconcept theories on consumption behaviour. The research question broadly focuses on the two major aspects of the study that is importance of self-discrepancy in understanding behavioural response in consumer behaviour. Another aspect is to investigate in detail the various moods and emotions related to retail therapy among women. The research question of self-discrepancy has several sub-components ideal-self, self-incongruence, ought-self, satisfaction, dissatisfaction, dejection, disappointment and actual-self are analysed. The various emotions (described in the hypotheses section) related to consumption behaviour w.r.t retail therapy which are aligned and relatable to self-discrepancy concepts are analysed to understand the relationship with the outcome-retail therapy among women. The study uses the sequential transformative strategy of mixed method research. In the present study, the qualitative data is collected is followed by quantitative data collection. The qualitative approach includes in-depth interviews, focus group discussion and quantitative data collection was through the self-administered questionnaires. The study uses inferential analysis and structural equation modelling for the data analysis. The present work holds critical ramifications for consumers' well-being and prosperity. The findings propose that consumer’s uncovered passionate turbulence may be more inclined to overspending and sinking overwhelmingly into obligation because of their expanded eagerness to pay for status-related items. the consumption is both reactive and proactive which originates from self and terminates in consumption.

OPINIONS FROM A MANAGERIAL POINT OF VIEW AND CUSTOMERS PERCEPTIONS,2018,"['luxury goods', 'production', 'industry 4.0', 'innovation', 'fashion & technology']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Introduction This paper investigates the implementation possibilities of the Industry 4.0 systems within the production of fashion luxury goods by collecting the opinion of the managers and the perception of the potential customers. The results indicate that technologies 4.0 can be implemented within luxury fashion production without affecting the quality of the finished product. However customers are negatively prevented against them. Therefore, giving the present situation of the fashion industry, now more demanding than ever, it would be appropriate to implement such systems without disclosing it to customers. Theoretical development With this research we aim to demonstrate that in the world of luxury fashion production there is room, if not the need, to implement the technologies of the Industry 4.0 without affecting the quality of the final product. We believe it is crucial that the luxury environment starts to seriously consider the Industry 4.0 as the former, in recent years, has become ever more challenging. Since luxury has become more accessible to masses, customers are no longer content just by getting the product, they often want it before the general public has it or fully customized to distinguish themselves. This implies a reduction of production times together with multiple rearrangements of the entire production process. Which is why we need to start thinking about Luxury and Industry 4.0. The concept of Industry 4.0 started developing with the exponential involvement of technological means during production processes of any kind. The term describes the model of the “smart” factory of the future where computer-driven systems “monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions” based on self-organization mechanisms (Smith, 2016). The goal of the industry 4.0 is to reach a deeper interconnection and cooperation between the available resources and the final customer; it’s a multiple layer engagement composed by complex machines, people, products, information within the production sight and all along the value chain (Tolio, 2016). The implementation of such systems allows achieving better levels of efficiency and contributes to increase the competitive advantage; it is a revolution that involves a company at all levels from the production centers to human resources. Although luxury fashion is a quite peculiar industry, all its processes are still very much cyclical and could benefit from the help of such implementations. The main technologies that are often quoted as being at the core of the Industry 4.0 are IoT (Internet of Things), big data, additive manufacturing, 3D printing, augmented reality and new generation robots. All this may seem too futuristic for an industry such as luxury that has always been associated with craftsmanship. When defining luxury in fact, one of the qualities attributed to this kind of products is the “strong connection with the past proven by the tradition handed down over time” (Dubois, 2001); a description that can be taken quite literally as the heritage of the brand is built upon the traditions passed on by the different artisans who crafted the product. But if we fraction the production process and analyze it in depth, we will see that it is cyclical, and that some of its parts may benefit from such technologies that would make it leaner without affecting the quality of the end product. An example of this can be seen in the laser cutting machines for leather. A robot can cut the elements required to compose a bag in a few minutes, while it would take up to half an hour to do it by hand. Even if mechanically cut though, the bag will still need to be assembled by a highly skilled artisan to become the exceptional quality product that customers expect to see in stores. Many are afraid that technological implementations will lead to the disappearance of the artisanal component failing to understand that the Industry 4.0 is not about complete automation but rather about human-machine interaction. Talking about production we will refer to the process in its integrity, from the sketches to the products in the stores. Research design The research was conducted using semi-structured interviews to questiont professionals who work in different stages of luxury fashion production for different companies. All the interviewees were chosen among the industry biggest players: LVMH, Kering, Richemont, Herm?s, Chanel and others. To establish the sample of interviewees we divided the production process into four main phases and then identified at least one professional to question for each one of them. The subdivision we applied was the following: ? Phase 1 - Creation & Design ? Phase 2 - Production & Merchandising ? Phase 3 - Retail & Marketing ? Phase 4 - Supply Chain & Distribution Each interviewee was asked a set of specific questions related to the complexities of their job and the problems encountered while doing it (Appendix 1). Among the sample there were two professionals that did not belong to the production process but that we deemed necessary to involve to have a more complete outcome. One is a Professor of Fashion design at the Politecnico of Milan, the other is a Strategic Planning Analyst who works for Lectra, one of the biggest companies producing technologies for fashion. In order to investigate the perception of the customers we distributed a multiple choice survey to a heterogeneous sample of 200 people. Among the questions asked one was strictly related to the use of technology while the others regarded arguments, related to its utilization, that emerged while interviewing the professionals. Despite not being directly on the use of technology, we deemed the other queries important to evaluate if the problems emerged from the interviews were relevant also from a customer point of view. The questions submitted via survey were the followings: 1) On a scale of 1 to 4, (1= low interest, 4=high interest) how interested are you in luxury goods? 2) How much worth is being able to buy a luxury good before it is on sale in stores? (1= not worth, 4= very worth) 3) Would you think of higher quality a bag completely handcrafted rather than the very same bag produced also by using industrial processes? 4) Would you attribute a higher value to a luxury product conceived to be respectful for the environment? The survey ended up highlighting that customers have a negative bias towards the exploitation of such systems within the production of luxury goods. In fact they attribute a higher value to completely handcrafted products, without considering the possibility that the latters may have more defects. The methodology used was successful in helping us understanding the opinion of the management along with the perceptions of the customers. Moreover, through the interviews we were able to highlight practical daily problems encountered by people directly involved in the production process. Results and conclusion We used the problems that arose as bases to begin thinking what could be concretely implemented, in which phase and with what goal. We started by focusing our attention on five points that currently challenge production and could be exploited as opportunities for the implementation of specific technology. Nevertheless, we also highlighted three main limits that might prevent the application of said technology. The opportunities of implementation were the following: Production times - Representing one of the biggest problems in the industry, we believe that technology could come to the rescue especially in the first two stages of the process. For example, the use of 3D printing to produce some prototypes or certain components that could be useful for reducing time and costs. Another example is Modaris 3D, a new generation software that allows you to digitize the pattern allowing you to see it in 3D. Exploiting this software would allow to predict the potential problems of the prototype before even crafting it and would help save a lot of time and resources. Not to mention that digitized patterns can be archived and easily reused later. Moreover, the exploitation of the new generation robots to pre-cut certain components would once again allow a shorter production time and reduce costs. Couterfeiting - Another implementation opportunity is represented by counterfeiting. Now that online commerce is booming, the fake industry is at its peak and people find it difficult to distinguish between what is real and what is not. IoT technologies could help immensely with this problem. One of the interviewees working in the distribution phase told us that today when the products are shipped, in order to track them down and recognize them from counterfeits, companies install into their pockets RFID chips, small chips similar to those of credit cards. Their limitation though is that they can be traced or recognized only if scanned. The use of IoT technologies on this type of device (for example, providing the same type of support with a GPS) would allow them to be interactive and serve their purpose even better when the products are shipped all over the world. Sustainability - In recent years the problem of sustainability has become increasingly relevant, to the point that some luxury empires have been built on it, as in the case of Stella McCartney. To pay more attention to the environmental cause, fashion houses could start by wasting less resources. One way to do this could be to use software to optimize pattern placements on fabrics or on leather. Human supervision would still be required, as some pieces need to be cut from specific parts of the leather but it would certainly help in making some useful proposals. Internal communication – Internal communication is a problem at all levels of the production process. It can be an issue especially when it comes to communicating the intentions of the design team to the production and controlling the stock level in real time. In the first case, to solve the problem, we could consider the implementation of a software like PLM (Product Life Management). This type of program helps to follow the transformation from sketches to prototypes to products, providing detailed information on everything that is present on the garment, specifying consumption and costs of materials. With regard to the inventory control problem, we could again use the help of the IoT. Inventory control is a problem both in terms of raw materials (for all those houses that produce prototypes internally) and finished products. In the first case a potential solution could be to label the raw materials with magnetic labels that would allow to see immediately when the components leave the stock. In the second case, as previously mentioned, supplying the finished products with IoT chips would help to locate them and know how many are in stock. Demand forecast – Another major help that industry 4.0 could bring to fashion production is the exploitation of big data to forecast the demand. Nowadays in fact, the constant and hardly predictable changes in fashion heavily affect a demand that already has few reference standards. When it comes to forecast, several factors have an impact on it: trends, social medias, consumption habits etc. The most unpredictable of these factors is probably represented by the social media as clients may cause a peek in demand after seeing a celebrity or an influencer wearing a specific product. Giving all this, it's evident how the more variables we are able to consider when doing forecasts, the better the chances of predicting a scenario close to reality and Big Data would allow to do so. As previously mentioned we also highlighted some limits that could prevent implementation: Costs - The more significant limit when talking about this kind of technology is related to costs. It is important to consider both the ones needed to purchase the technology as well as the ones to train the employees in order to make the implementation possible. As we all know technology is extremely expensive, and in a certain way a form of luxury itself, often being just for few. The size of the brand would modulate of course the amount of the investment in it. Client perception & adverse attitude – The survey pointed out that clients are negatively biased towards technology and, if informed that the product has been realized with the help of technological means, may attribute to it a lower value. What it's necessary to keep in mind though, is that, when taking a survey, you are in front of a screen and not in front of the products. I believe in fact that if a blind test was conducted presenting two products of which one completely handcrafted and the other realized by artisans who exploited technological means as well, no one would be able to tell the difference. Training of employees - Another big challenge in the implementation of such systems is the training of the employees. Implementing these technologies for some employees may mean learning again how to do their job with the help of a computer. Being an environment where youngsters are outscored due to the lack of experience, this may represent a problem. In conclusion our research proved that there is indeed room to implement the 4.0 systems as the issues emerged can be partially, if not completely, solved by introducing these technologies making the process leaner and more efficient. Nevertheless, giving the fact that customers are negatively biased towards their use, it would be appropriate avoiding to disclose the information with them."

Since the 1920s, this system has also been established by a number of continental law countries and regions. In terms of the trust legislation of these continental law countries and regions, it is very distinctive compared with the British and American trust legislation in terms of both model and content. The unique system structure and function of trust have been in accordance with the needs of China's contemporary society for property management and long-term financing. Property transformation and property management are the basic function of trust which promote financing, capital accumulation and social welfare and so on. our country has entered the real economy, intellectual property and financial and economic era. The development of modern society is far beyond the category of the original property law adjustment, so our property law system should match with the actual economic development in our country. This paper makes an empirical study of the limitations of the traditional “property and obligation dichotomy system”, which leads to the disorientation of the beneficial right of trust in judicial practice. There are some defects in China's trust legislation concerning the classification of property rights and the regulation of trust industry. Behind these defects lies the conflict between the traditional concept of “property and obligation dichotomy system” in civil law and the trust system. Failure to actively coordinate or even ignore such institutional conflicts is not only detrimental to the unification of the legal system, but also inevitable to eliminate the positive functions of the trust system. The property right of trust is a kind of intangible property, which consists of the Client's right of supervision, the trustee's right of management and the beneficiary's right of interest. Chinese civil code should stipulate the principle of civil rights in the general principles of civil law."

The R-YIp system contains a reusable selective marker (CgTRP1), loxP sequence, and target sequence for integration. Therefore, many gene expression cassettes can be integrated into the same position of the same yeast chromosome. In the present study, several model enzymes involving xylan/xylose metabolism were examined, including endoxylanase (XYLP), β-xylosidase (XYLB), xylose reductase (GRE3) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XYL2). Efficient expression of these genes was obtained using two promoters (GAL10p and ADH1p) and various plasmids (pGMF-GENE and pAMF-GENE plasmids) were constructed. The XYLP, XYLB, GRE3, and XYL2 genes were efficiently expressed under the control of the GAL10 promoter. Subsequently, R-YIps containing the GAL10p-GENE-GAL7t cassette were constructed, resulting in pRS-XylP, pRS-XylB, pRS-Gre3, and pRS-Xyl2 plasmids. These plasmids were sequentially integrated into chromosome VII of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain by repeated gene integration and selective marker rescue. These genes were integrated by the R-YIp system and were stably expressed in the yeast transformants to produce active recombinant enzymes. Therefore, we expect that the R-YIp system will be able to overcome current limitations of the host cells and allow selective marker selection for the integration of various genes into the yeast chromosome."

This paper did historical investigation about this phenomena with the focus on the ‘change from the above’ and the ‘change from the below’. The ‘change from the above’ means the Roosevelt government’s pro-union public policy and the NLRA enactment, while the ‘change from the below’ means the labor movement led by CIO. The major research results are as follows. Firstly, the enactment of NLRA indicates direct labor market intervention by the Roosevelt government from the laissez-faire policy. The NLRA stirred the ‘change from the below’, and, therefore, CIO was born and it grew rapidly with the success of GM and U.S. Steel strikes. Secondly, the newborn CIO overwhelmed the old AFL and led the labor movement in New Deal era, because the workers wanted industrial unions under the well established mass manufacturing system of the U.S. Also, the good relationship between the CIO and the Roosevelt government also contributes to the growth and success of the CIO. Thirdly, the NLRA’s ideal model of cooperative labor-management relations based upon power balance ended in competitive labor-management relations based upon power balance. It is because of the philosophical and tactical discrepancy in achieving the goal between the ‘change from the above’ and the ‘change from the below’. For example, CIO’s sit-down strike was a good weapon for the ‘change from the below’, but a deadly poison for the ‘change from the above’."

Started in the 1920s, the field of landscape architecture is also characterized by a distinctiveness that separates it from the stylistic features and picturesque style of the previous period. The visual-centric viewpoint of the earlier period was rejected by diverse genres of art and the fixed perspective was dissolved. This study examines the effect of the changing perspective on the late modern and modern landscape architecture, with a focus on the 1920s. It traces how visual-centric influence and anti-visual-centric thought interacted and developed an interconnection during this time. Furthermore, the study discusses how the haptic perception characteristics represented by anti-visual-centric thought were realized. (Method) To examine the aspects of the haptic perception expressed in modern and contemporary landscaping, we first gained inductive insight from various landscape architects from the 1920s and case studies. First, the concepts and characteristics of haptic perception are derived through previous research and a literature survey. Second, in the period before 1920s, the difference in the way that the desire for pure nature fused “nature” into the city appeared, and various visual models were explored to form a competitive landscape. Third, we examined the background of the “Modernism” style that appeared after the 1920s; we also explore the characteristics of haptic perception in the modernist landscape through case analysis, as well as how it influenced postmodernism. (Results) The key features of haptic perception are the ambiguity and obscurity of the boundary, the generation of dynamic perspectives, the induction of motility by indefinite circulation, as well as strangeness and sublime beauty due to the impossibility of perception. The transition of the pre-1920s perspective of landscape architecture probably originated from the shifting attitude toward transforming “nature.” The desire for pure nature has seen various attempts to fuse “nature” into the city. After the 1920s, modernist landscape architecture emerged due to the shifting space-time perception and the influence of avant-garde art. This modernist landscape architecture manifests various characteristics of “haptic perception.” (Conclusions) Prior to the 1920s, “nature”—such as parks, roadside trees, and green areas—were fused into various forms within the city, where visual models based on visual thinking spread around the world. In modern landscaping, the most work most characteristic of haptic perception is that of Lawrence Halprin, which contains a wealth of haptic perception elements rather than that of the previous picturesque garden. It also activates haptic perception by enhancing the sense of proximity, expanding the human senses, and providing a strange environment by introducing new materials and colors."
기독교 영성교육에 있어서 회심과 양육의 통전적 결합에 관한 연구: 십자가의 요한의 “영혼의 어두운 밤” 개념을 중심으로,2018,"['conversion and nurture', 'the dark night of the soul of St. John of the Cross', 'James E. Loder', 'James W.

Loder)의 회심에 기반한 ‘변형이론’과 제임스 파울러(James W. Fowler)의 양육에 기반한 ‘신앙발달이론’의 논쟁이 바로 그것이다. 그러나 이것은 비단 기독교교육의 논쟁만은 아니다. 영성학에서도 그 근본문제에 있어서는 이 화두를 벗어나기 어렵다. 긍정신학과 부정신학에 각각 바탕을 둔 영신수련(spiritual exercise)과 영성형성(spiritual formation)도 결국 이러한 긍정의 길(via positiva)을 강조하는 하나님의 내재성(Immanence)과 부정의 길(via negativa)을 강조하는 하나님의 초월성(transcendence)중 어떤 것에 기인하느냐의 문제로 비슷한 양상으로 전개된다.이에 본고는 이러한 논쟁의 중재를 위한 접촉점을 십자가의 요한의 “영혼의 어두운 밤”에서 찾고자 한다. 왜냐하면 영성형성의 하나님과의 일치를 향한 상승모델 중 십자가의 요한의 “영혼의 어두운 밤”에서 회심은 양육으로 이어지고 이 양육은 또 다른 회심을 필요로 하며 연결되어 가기 때문이다. 이 논문은 이처럼 회심, 양육, 그리고 이 둘의 만남의 장으로서의 십자가의 요한이 주장한 “영혼의 어두운 밤” 개념을 통해 회심과 양육의 연속선상의 기독교 영성교육적 적용점을 찾아가는 연구이다.","In the 500 years since the Reformation, The Korean Church has experienced internal and external disturbances and crisis of oneness. Internally, there are the hereditariness of the senior pastor position and attacks of heresy such as Shinchunji. Externally, The Korean Church meets a problem of taxation of religious men. Seeking the reason of The Korean Church's problems, some say it causes an indiscriminate acceptation of Church members. Others say, even though obedience of Jesus’ commitment (Matthew 28:19-20) does not matter, the problem is the absence of a nurturing system for new believers in The Korean Church. From that comes The Korean Church's ignorance of Paul’s command in the Bible: nurturing of mature and pious Christians (1 Timothy 4:7-8).What comes first? Propagation of Christianity or the nurture of mature Christians? This issue leads to a dispute between two Jameses in the Christian Education department: James W Fowler and James E. Loder. This study will deal with the debate between 'conversion's priority' and 'nurture's priority' as one of Christian Education's classic battles dating back to 1981. This educational issue also relates to spiritual theology's issue about the debate between spiritual formation based on God's immanence and spiritual exercise based on God's transcendence. To this point, in spiritual education, we should pay attention to the dark night of the soul of St. John of the Cross as the meeting point of these two extremes. Thus, first of all, this study will explore Fowler and Loder's theories. After that, I will trace the dark night of soul of St. John of the Cross as an answer to the dispute.The structure of the study is as follows: In chapter Ⅱ, I will deal with the dispute between conversion and nurture in Christian Education. In this chapter, I will explore the conversations of Fowler's stages of faith, Loder's transforming moments, and each opinion in more detail. In chapter Ⅲ, I will explain three traditional ways of spirituality to the union with God: Imitation of Christ, Pilgrimage, and an ascent to union with God. Through the third way, I will find the meeting point of Loder's (conversion) and Fowler's (nurture) theories. In chapter Ⅳ, I will deeply examine a representative model of a way of an ascent to union with God, the dark night of the soul of St. John of the Cross. In chapter V, as an applied part, I will conclude this study by offering suggestions for the future and the task of Christian education fields."

A depression scale test (BDI) was used as a pre and post test to see how the cognitive-behavioral reading therapy program reduced depression. At the same time, in order to explore the process of reducing depression and reduction mechanism, the program was conducted with color drawing test, emotional expression word test, and subjective depression index test. In this process, the researcher received the prior consent from the participant for qualitative research, wrote the recordings of each session, observed and recorded the behavior changes, and analyzed the interviews of the participant and her husband. As a result, the cognitive behavioral reading therapy program was effective in reducing depression in middle-aged women. While exploring and expressing their emotions, participants experienced areduction in depression through the process of recognizing negative and automatic thinking and transforming it into a rational and positive thinking. Third, we could see that the reduction mechanism of depression was ‘perception and acceptance for Core belief’. Therefore, this single case study is meaningful that the cognitive behavior reading therapy program for reducing depression of middle-aged women presented a model suitable for actual counseling field and provided basic data for understanding middle-aged women more deeply in sociocultural context"

Its research period lasted for 4 months from September to December, 2017, and I, as the research place, used the art room at Gunsan Sulsan Elementary School. The programs were totally 10 sessions with a unit of 1 session per each grade for 2 hours from 1:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon from Monday through Friday.I fixed ten themes of this program-eight plane modeling, and two solid modeling, and finished the work of storytelling during summer vacation. And I arranged their levels as low:middle:high(3:5:2) ones.The former was ‘A Film of Monster Gorilla’(L), ‘Learning the Spirit of Gyeongju Choi’s Family’(M), ‘A Tale of My Friend Made of Natural Materials’(L), ‘The Reading of My Dream’(M), ‘Gathering the Objects in My Mobile’(M), ‘A Mock Trial of Marrying Off’(M), ‘Painting My Favorite Children’s Poem’(H), and ‘Painting My Favorite Children’s Song’(H), and the latter was ‘Seeking for a Bluebird in My Mind’(L), and ‘Making My Cherished Object’ (M).Then I used the unique art expression technique per each theme, which were in sequence marbling, Korean paper art, combine painting, collage, imaginary painting, imaginary painting, play dough art, imaginary painting techniques. And I delivered to the students the scientific knowledge in terms of growing or manufacturing processes of materials used for making artworks.Prior to and after the processing this program, I surveyed about the students’ ability of integrated thinking and emotional experience by ‘Figure B Type’ and ‘Figure A Type’ of The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, and took statistics with the resultant data. And I executed a paired t-test in order to verify the significance of mean difference in the result of investigation with those data.From the analyzed result according to the elements of creativity and the mean quotients of creativity, there showed a significant difference (t=3.47, p<.01) in ‘fluency’, and also a significant difference(t=3.59, p<.01) in ‘creativity.’ Judging from the statistic values of two fields such as the student’s ability of integrated thinking and emotional experience, I estimate that over the majority of the students showed the enhancement in self-confident creative expression as well as higher interest and concern through this program.The result that I arranged and analyzed the making process of artworks, the photos of the resultant, etc. as such is as follows : Firstly, from this program being proceeded as art-centered STEAM class, the student’s systematic problem-solving ability was improved in his ability of integrated thinking to transform the literary contents into artistic one.Secondly, the student obtained the emotional experience such as interest in the class, selfconfidence, intellectual satisfaction, self-fulfillment, etc. through art-centered STEAM class using ten art expression techniques.Thirdly, the student’s mind willing to cooperate, communicate with his friends, and care for them - 322 - was ripened in the process of problem-solving.Fourth, the student’s self-confidence was further instilled when presenting famous artists and their artworks in the introduction and finale of ten art expression techniques.Likewise, the statistic values on the fields of student’s ability of integrated thinking and emotional experience illustrate that over the majority of the students showed improvement in the ability of creative expression with confidence as well as higher interest and concern upon this program."
ARE YOU IN(GAGED)? THE IMPORTANCE OF ENGAGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE ON EMPLOYEES AND ORGANIZATIONS' SUCCESS,2018,"['engagement', 'experience', 'employee', 'recognition', 'happy']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Introduction This study intends to analyse the impact of the engagement and employee experience towards the employee and employer success. The results demonstrate that organisations are conscious of the importance of retain and create happiness at work and are starting to create an internal experience for their workforce. They want to have employees engaged and retain talent. When employees are more committed to be happier at work they tend to take part of the ownership of their organisations. Employers and employees are more focused on people and the value that they can add to every single product and/or service they design, create and deliver. All this investment on internal world is feeding a better consumer experience as the quality standards are getting higher. Theoretical development The main goal is to evidence how the engagement is attaining more importance on both sides: employee and employer. In the past years, a growing number of studies and are giving more importance to the human side on organisations (e.g., Sinek, 2009; Nayar, 2010; Medeiros 2017). From the transactional economy, organizations are walking to an emotional, experience economy. In the customer-centric dynamics, organisations are taken employees first because these, once deep involved with the mission and goals of the organization, will be more devoted to customers. People “who love going to work are more productive and more creative. They go home happier and have happier families. They treat their colleagues and customers better. Inspired employees make stronger economies.” (Sinek, 2009, p.14) Without happy and empowered employees, the service will never achieve the best and higher levels to then be delivered to the customers. Company “can (should) focus on its value creators – the frontline employees. (…) in his or her knowledge, creativity commitment to tasks, and capacity to collaborate. In fact, (…) “the true value is created in the interface between the customer and the employee. (…) When a company puts its employees first, the customer actually does ultimately come first and gains the greatest benefit.” (Nayar, 2010, p.7). Internal engagement is crucial to companies’ reputation, to brand/service perception and ultimately for the business survival and successful future: “Employees who are dispositionally self-efficacious and proactive are likely to use their initiative, engage in proactive service performance, take charge to bring about change, proactively solve problems and implement ideas.” (Patterson et al., 2009). Research design According to the authors of the model applied, “we define engagement as the attitude, behaviour, the level of connectedness among customers, between customers and employees and of customers and employees with the firm.” (Kumar and Pansari, 2016, p. 498). This was the starting point for our interviews and our study. To complete this exploratory study, we’ve decided to follow a qualitative research by creating a script and interviewed 4 people in 10 organisations based in Lisbon. “Qualitative research starts from and returns to words, talk, and texts as meaningful representations of concepts.” (Pratt, 2009, p.856). The original script was written in English, then translated to Portuguese to be applied on the organisations. Each interview was fully transcript in Portuguese and the main findings and relevant content were enlightened in English to produce this paper. On each organisation, four employees were chosen: two women and two men from different departments and positions - board management, executive leadership, line managers and individual contributors. All interviewed people have Portuguese nationality and have a labour contract with their employer organisation. None outsourced employees have been selected to this study. All employees have between 25 and 50 years old. Interviews were done individually on the headquarters of each organisation. Interviews took between 45 and 60 minutes each. All conversations have been recorded with the individual’s authorisation. The note of confidentiality was explained and applied to all of them. The interviews followed the same script: three main blocks on a semi-structure script. Participants were asked to think about engagement and experience and share their thoughts and examples. Different organisations were chosen: multinational companies, agencies, national companies, private funds. The diversity of the organisations was accepted and taken as an added value to our work. To convert all audio into text, we’ve applied the google audio tool and a Huawei phone app that can transform audio into text. A final check was done in order to verify all sentences and avoid mishaps. After all transcription, a content analysis has been done and the most relevant facts, insights and details have been listed. The content analysis was done using the MAXQDA software. Results and conclusions The main goal of this exploratory study was to determine how engagement and experience are taking such an important role on employees and employers success. In order to be happier at work, employees are more committed and accountable. In the same equation, and to retain more talent, organisations are more focused on employees and how to design and delivery to them a better internal experience. The main finding confirm that happier and recognised employees work better, work more and have the ownership of the organisations they work for. Once people are happy and have good work conditions – financial, physic and technological – they will go further and beyond to deliver their tasks and when needed they will internally cooperate with their teammates or with other departments. To promote this good environment and to keep workforce with them, employers are changing the future of work, nevertheless a few organisations are not applying this or taking these questions as a priority. According to the content analysis of all interviews below a few findings that we would like to highlight: 1) Most of the interviewees say they like their jobs and they are happy at work. They feel that they are part of something: family, team, organisation, culture. 2) The feeling of belonging was mentioned multiple times – the emotional link and the human aspect of being accepted and valuable inside the organisation. 3) All interviewed people, despite the job and the position they have, spoke about the power of recognition and the importance of this aspect to retain talent. 4) All interviewed people raised the importance of happiness at work, the wellbeing variable and the crucial aspect of work/life balance. 5) All interviewed employees agreed that their organisations value more the individual, their soft skills, than the job position and the tasks that there are committed and designated to do. 6) From the point of view of organisations, as leaders and builders of a strategy, we could note that only a few are planning and designing a structured employee experience. Nevertheless, all companies have a list of benefits and create events to get together their employees and promote a better life for them. Following a more structured or more informal way, all interviewed organisations implement a list of actions to create a good work environment: flexibility on the work hours, the possibility to work from home, the team/company dinners and parties; the physical structure with infrastructures to have lunch or to have a break; the empowerment of the employees by asking them to be part of the decisions. 7) Only a few of the interviewed claim that their organisations are promoting situations of work mobility and career progression. Most of the people explained that is difficult to grow or to move from departments. 8) Both, organisations and employees, understand that the salary is not an imperative condition to work or to retain people. Employees value more other work conditions and benefits. The fact is that different and heterogeneous organisations understand and reveal concern in taking care of their people and on the importance of retain their employees. Strategies, or more simple activities, are taking place. All of 40 employees, aside their gender, ages, under all circumstances and positions, want the same: recognition, to be happy and to balance, the best way possible, their work and their life. People want to be treated as people, as an exclusive human being as each of one of human beings are: a unique person and to be recognise whenever they do an extra effort. And this is the part of the key for the success of employers and employees (see figure 1)."

The Study aims to construct a new 3D printing fashion material design method by combining the generating principle of fractal geometry, which is a natural form principle, and the structure principle of a textile structure, to satisfy both aesthetic creativity and functionality as a fashion material. 3D printing and fractal geometry have commonality that they are easy to applied in topology, and they are a new modeling principle that combines nature, science, and art. The purpose of this study is to propose various implementations for expanding the base of 3D printing fashion materials and to create a new design method in terms of production technology as well as individual manufacturing area. The principle of fractal generation starts with minimized forms such as lines, geometrical shapes, etc. The shape of fractal geometry in the design is expressed in a patterned order that organizes the unit form. It was modeled to the texture of the surface of the yarn by setting the three-dimensional coordinates through 3D modeling and the 3D printing fashion material using the basic organization such as knitting, linking, and chain mail. Then, a design method was established through the program study for the set fractal image transformation, and the efficiency of 3D printing which can output the yarn and the final form at once was confirmed. Through this research, it is expected that the 3D printing production method based on the flexible fabric structure will be developed as a core design method for practical application of the more formal fabric in the rapidly developing 3D printer market."

Adolescents, who are situated between childhood and adulthood, are more easily influenced by this trend of postmodernism since they are still in the making of their identity. Thus postmodern trends aggravate confusion and fragmentation in the life of adolescents. This study will delve into variety of educational subjects concerning adolescents by using the categories of 'pain' and 'passion.' The pain dimension of adolescent life are exposed by depression, violence, delinquency, addiction, suicide, etc. On the other hand, the passion dimension of adolescents are expressed by singing, dancing, festivals, travels, experiments, loyalty, etc. Comparatively speaking, we can say that the one is related with the inner and passive dimension of adolescents and the other is related with their outer and active dimension. This inquiry explicates that the pain and passion of adolescents are not separated but rather interrelated like both sides of a coin. When they feel more pain, it may signify that they have more passion, and vice versa. In short, the essential task for Christian educators is to integrate constructive pain with meaningful passion in order to enlighten oneself, surrounding communities, and the world based upon Christian truth claim. This study names this sort of Christian education ""Holistic Christian Education for Youth.""  This study develops and proposes “5R Educational System” as a method with which Holistic Christian Education for Youth can be implemented. 5R corresponds to five conceptual words which begin with ""R"": Rebooting, Renewal, Reenactment, Reformation, and Reecho. These five activities are interrelated one another in a dynamic way. These five actions are steps rather than stages and thus they are mutually supportive and reinforce one another inherently in a circular manner.  The ultimate model of Holistic Christian Education for Youth is the Educational Ministry of Jesus Christ. As a young man Jesus himself showed an example of holistic educational ministry which includes all people in all places in all ages. As a young man he experienced extreme pain and passion for all people. He integrated the great pain on the Cross with passion for the salvation. As followers of Jesus and as ""little Jesus"" in a sense Christian youths need to be embraced, encouraged, and educated to integrate their pain with passion for God and God's people. Toward this goal this study strives so that it may provide a holistic model for Christian Youth Education."

Therefore, on the basis of characteristics and spectrum persuaded at a time when the arts and cultural education and dance education are broadly expanded, the result of this study after taking a look at the role of dance education within the arts and cultural education is shown as follows.The value striving for by the culture and arts education and dance education is to structure the life form with the artistic experience through the art as the ultimate life description. This is attributable to the fact that the artistic trait structured with self-understanding and self-expression contains the directivity of life that is recorded and depicted in the process of life.The dance education in the culture and arts education has the trait to view the world with the dance structure as the comprehensive study as in other textbook or art genre under the awareness of time and education system category within the school system and it has diverse social issues combined as related to the frame of social growth and advancement outside of school.When taking a look at the practical characteristics (method) of dance based on the arts and cultural education business, it facilitates the practice strategy through dance, in dance, about dance, between dance with the artist for art [dance].

The two aspects of the movement, developed coincidently before and after the epochal demonstration accident on May Fourth, 1919, were different each other in their origins and natures, but they had the common historical background and were promoted by the same leadership of new intellectuals and youthful students around universities and colleges. Accordingly, the two aspects joined each other and united into the greater movement, namely, May Fourth Movement in a broad sense. The New Culture Movement was a modern enlightenment movement in essence, against the Chinese tradition of civilization, and was to be inclined to modern Western civilization as model to rebuild Chinese state. Though happened protesting the Japanese aggression and pro-Japanese warlord Beijing regime, the May Fourth Movement also was originated from Chinese confronting with the advanced Western powers ultimately. So in the long run, it seems the nationalist movement was in contradiction with the new cultural movement. However, it is the historical characteristic of the movement that this contradiction between two aspects were harmonized each other in short period until their split at the beginning of the National Revolution. The substantial ideas of May Fourth enlightenment campaign were individual human rights and ideology of science, based on the evolutionary world view of competitive progress. Individual human rights as the basis of liberalism, and science as the fulfill of reason, these two ideas were the ideological forces driving the iconoclastic enlightenment thought against the Confucian ethics and other Chinese tradition. The great subject of enlightenment campaign was to rebuild the Chinese cultural and social conditions that had led to the fail of the Republic, in order to confront the national crisis. This momentum to pave the way for modern national state by the enlightenment, had common ground with the nationalist effort to resist foreign powers. Meanwhile, Chinese national movement, begun in the end of Qing dynasty, was formed in full scale through the May Fourth Movement. The enlightenment and nationalism in May Fourth Period, established their independent basis on social opinion and societies, separated from existing political scene. This is their historical originality differed from the past political campaign to save nation. The two aspects of May Fourth Movement begun directly after the World War Ⅰ, experienced a great transition stage before and after the end of World War. The great conversion of universal trend of thoughts from military rivalry between nations to utopian cosmopolitanism gave rise to the ideas of democracy and international cooperation and national self-determination of people. Under these influences, the two aspects of May Fourth Movement underwent a great change, claiming the end of civil war among warlords and foreign aggression. In consequence, The new prospects was opened for the mass nationalist and democratic movement, that affected the enlightenment movement, shifting emphasis from human rights and science to democracy and science. The democracy originated in Western Europe was liberal democracy operated by parliamentary politics through representative system, and thereafter the sphere of its concepts was so extended to include economic democracy and commoner’s democracy, etc., that it began from a concrete political methods at first and was transformed to the idealistic ideology for human welfare. Because of the introduction of ideological democracy during World War Ⅰ, Chinese ideas of democracy were confused without their accurate understanding about its origin, diverse patterns and multiple meanings. Towards the end of World War, socialism, and even Marxism.Leninism were adopted in the concept of democracy, as an idealisti"

It compactly illustrates buildings from Sima Guang’s garden within a single picture frame and demonstrates mastery of meticulous brush strokes and application of blue and green pigments. However, since no inscriptions or seals remain and there are only a handful of related artworks or literary records, the theme of this painting had been a mystery. It had previously been called Enjoyment of Life (行樂圖). After withdrawing from office, Sima Guang settled in Luoyang and built his Garden of Solitary Joy(Dule yuan) for his retirement and writing of books. The garden had seven buildings dedicated to literary figures from the Han to Tang dynasties that Sima Guang admired. The Dushu tang (讀書堂, reading hall) was a space to venerate the Confucian scholar Dong Zhongshu (董仲舒, B.C. 179–B.C. 93); Nongshui xuan (弄水軒, pavilion for playing with water) was associated with the Tang poet Du Mu (杜牧, 803–852); and Diaoyu an (釣魚庵, fishing hut) was related to the seclusion of Yan Guang (嚴光, B.C. 39–41). The Zhongzhu zhai (種竹齋, studio for planting bamboo) was to honor Wang Huizhi (王徽之, ?–388) who adored bamboo; Caiyao pu (采藥圃, herb garden of collecting medicine), the Later Han hermit Han Kang (韓康, dates unknown); Jiaohua ting (澆花亭, pavilion of watering flowers), the Tang poet Bai Juyi (白居易, 772–846); and Jianshan tai (見山臺, platform of seeing mountain), Tao Qian (陶潛, 365–427). At each building, Sima Guang recalled these seven literary figure’s secluded lives and sought to emulate their ideal literary and leisurely lifestyles. While investigating the background of the production of Garden of Solitary Joy in the collection of the National Museum of Korea that harmoniously depicts the different motifs of the seven buildings in the Dule yuan garden, I came across a similar painting produced at the end of the Ming Dynasty.This Ming version by Tan Xuan (譚玄) in the collection of Museum of East Asian Art in Cologne, Germany is iconographically similar to the version at the National Museum of Korea, suggesting itsorigins and production background.  long with other later versions, referring to Chinese examples and adding new interpretations. Joseon literati, who were fully aware of Sima Guang’s “Record of the Garden of Solitary Joy” and the poem “Sima Guang’s Garden of Solitary Joy” by Su Shi (蘇軾, 1037–1101) through Chinese classics such as Treasury of Ancient Writings (古文眞寶, Guwen zhenbo), might have commissioned a transformation of the main motif of Garden of Solitary Joy paintings.Meticulously drawn color paintings, including Garden of Solitary Joy, Silk Weaving (1697), Historical Figures, and Traces of the Sage Confucius (1700), were all modeled after Chinese originals. In particular, it is noteworthy that during the reign of King Sukjong (肅宗, r. 1674–1720) the king and officials encouraged the copying of Chinese paintings to replace the many early and mid-Joseon paintings that had been lost in the Japanese and Manchu invasions. The introduction of various Chinese paintings at the time also inspired the copying of Chinese examples. King Sukjong ordered a reproduction project as a means to reestablish the Joseon royal collection of calligraphy and painting and enhance the skills of Joseon painters. King Sukjong highly praised the Chinese painter Meng Yingguang (孟英光, 1590s–after 1648), who had visited Joseon, and viewed Meng’s works several times. Consequently, Meng’s paintings were frequently copied by members of the Joseon royal family and scholar-officials. Furthermore, paintings of Qiu Ying were appreciated and copied. Considering these circumstances, the fact that the professional painter Jo Se-geol (曹世傑, 1636–after 1705) from Pyongyang produced commissioned works and his relationship with commissioners provide the clues to the probable context in which the Garden of Solitary Joy in the National Museum of Korea was created. Starting in his childhood, Jo Se-geol practiced Chinese styles by imitating Chinese paintings owned by his family. After earning a reputation as a painter, Jo was commissioned by Kim Su-jeung (金壽增, 1624–1701) and Kim Seok-ju to imitate Meng Yingguang’s Goddess of the Luo River with Red Threads (洛神紅線圖) and Departure of Lady Wenji from the Nomad Camp, originally attributed to Zhao Mengfu (趙孟頫, 1254–1322). Jo also produced a painting of Juxing (聚星圖) at the request of Song Si-yeol (宋時烈, 1607–1689) and Kim Su-jeung. By commissioning such works, they strove to visualize their ambition and aimed to unite scholars into the School of the Westerners. Accordingly, the Garden of Solitary Joy in the National Museum of Korea is thought to have been commissioned by an official such as Kim Seok-ju who admired the Confucian scholar Sima Guang or by an influential literati who projected himself onto Sima Guang’s enjoyment of a secluded life.this article examines the Garden of Solitary Joy by Qiu Ying (仇英, 1494–1552), which is considered a prototype of Chinese paintings on this theme. Through a comparative analysis of these similar works, this article will shed light on distinctive features of the Garden of Solitary Joy from the Joseon Dynasty in the collection of the National Museum of Korea. Garden of Solitary Joy by Qiu Ying faithfully illustrates Sima Guang’s essay “Record of the Garden of Solitary Joy” (獨樂園記, Dule yuan ji) and exerted a considerable impact on subsequent artists. From the right end to the left on the handscroll, the seven buildings, Nongshui xuan, Dushu tang, Diaoyu an, Zhongzhu zai, Caiyao pu, Jiaohua ting, and Jianshan tai, are depicted. In each space Sima Guang appears alone absorbed in contemplation. Qiu Ying’s paintings, including Garden of Solitary Joy, were so popular that various forgeries were created in Suzhou starting in the late sixteenth century. Painters of later generations also began to produce paintings of historical figures in the style of Qiu Ying. Around the seventeenth century, many Garden of Solitary Joy paintings were produced in the hanging scroll format by combining and reconstructing pictorial elements from Qiu Ying’s handscroll. Representative examples can be found in the National Gallery in Prague and the Museum of East Asian Art in Cologne. In these hanging scrolls, Sima Guang is presented only once inside a bamboo dome in the garden. The other depictions of Sima Guang in Qiu Ying’s handscroll have either been omitted or replaced with different figures. Later artists, such as the professional artist Tan Xuan from Suzhou and various Joseon painters, created their own versions of Garden of Solitary Joy through iconographic modification and the combination of different painting styles.It is unclear when the Garden of Solitary Joy theme was introduced to Joseon. Nevertheless, the literati Hwang Jun-ryang (黃俊良, 1517–1563), a disciple of Yi Hwang (李滉, 1502–1571), owned ten paintings of historical figures, including Solitary Joy in Luoshe (落社獨樂圖). According to some records, Hong Ju-won (洪柱元, 1606–1672) also owned a painting of Mr. Sushui’s Garden of Solitary Joy (涑水先生獨樂園圖), and in 1682 Kim Seok-ju (金錫胄, 1634–1684) acquired the freestanding screen of Garden of Solitary Joy by Qiu Ying. All of this attests to Joseon literati’s awareness and appreciation of Garden of Solitary Joy paintings. A stylistic analysis of the version at the National Museum of Korea and the comparison with Joseon paintings of historical figures revealed that it can be presumed to have been produced around the late seventeenth century. Half a century after Tan Xuan created his Garden of Solitary Joy, Joseon painters were producing their own versions reflecting their Chinese counterparts but distinct as well. In contrast to Tan Xuan’s painting, the version at the National Museum of Korea omits some objects and human figures and integrates others. Furthermore, the new motif of a go board emerged. Red daylilies replaced lotus flowers in the motif of Jiaohua ting dedicated to Bai Juyi. Joseon painters created Garden of Solitary Joy paintings in a distinctive style by"

This study analyzed whether the performance of listed companys CSR management in Korea Exchange could provide a consistent result of the positive effect on corporate value. The Economic Justice Research Institute(KEJI), under the Economic Justice Practice Confederation, annually measures and announces the KEJI Index. In this study, 78 samples were selected among the companies that were included more than 5 times in the top 200 companies from 2010 to 2016, then they were analyzed by utilizing the financial performance data of F&G Guide(www.fnguide.com). The results of the study are as follows.  First, we found that the CSR performance, the economic justice index, has a significant positive effect on firm value. The impact of CSR outcomes on corporate value is achieved through various channels. However, it was interesting to analyze whether CSR performance positively or negatively affects firm value, or whether there is any relationship between the two variables, this study found that CSR performance has a positive effect on corporate value. we supports a stakeholder-centric approach. Also, we supports Bragdon and Marlin (1972), Waddock and Graves (1997), Tsoutsoura (2004) and Al-Tuwaijri et al. (2004) and others that have shown that there is a significant positive correlation between CSR and financial performance using the CSR score as a CSR index.  Second, we found that the KEJI Index, which is a CSR result, has a negative effect on capital cost using PE ratio. The negative impact of CSR outcomes on capital costs is a signal of predictive information that CSR will benefit in the future, it additionally suggests that stakeholders related to financing are evaluating the creditworthiness of the company that created the CSR performance and lowering the cost of capital. In other words, firms with high CSR performances can be judged to lower their capital costs by evaluating their creditworthiness higher than those with low CSR performance. In addition, if the CSR performance is disclosed, a firm with high CSR performance can prevent the possible conflicts between the company and the society in advance, then is able to reduce capital costs because capital markets are taken the signal that the information asymmetry that lowers the companys business risk as a reduction in the estimation risk of a company. The lower the cost of capital used as a substitute for the discount rate, the higher the enterprise value.  Third, we found that the KEJI Index of the evaluation period(t), that is, the CSR performance, has a positive effect on Tobins Q ratio, which is a substitute value of the enterprise value in the period after the evaluation(t + 1). This shows that there is a virtuous cycle in which CSR performance and corporate value are influenced by each other. Companies with good cash flow and good corporate value are more active in CSR accompanied by capital expenditures and at the same time companies that are loyal to CSR are raising social reputation and employees morale and eventually improving corporate value. This supports the work of Waddock and Graves(1997).  It is necessary to confirm whether there is a causal relationship from corporate value to CSR performance through a regression model by using the corporate value of the company before the evaluation of CSR management as the independent variable and KEJI Index which is corporate value as the dependent variable. This study verified the influence of Tobins Q ratio, which is the enterprise value, on the variables that are logically transformed about the KEJI Index, ie CSR performance. As a result of the analysis, the average value of Tobin s Q ratio that is prior to CSR performance evaluation showed significant influence on CSR performance."
Avalanche and Bit Independence Properties of Photon-counting Double Random Phase Encoding in Gyrator Domain,2018,"['Double random phase encoding', 'Discrete Gyrator transform', 'Optical security', 'Photon counting imaging', 'Avalanche and bit independence criterion']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we evaluate cryptographic properties of a double random phase encoding (DRPE) scheme in the discrete Gyrator domain with avalanche and bit independence criterions. DRPE in the discrete Gyrator domain is reported to have higher security than traditional DRPE in the Fourier domain because the rotation angle involved in the Gyrator transform is viewed as additional secret keys. However, our numerical experimental results demonstrate that the DRPE in the discrete Gyrator domain has an excellent bit independence feature but does not possess a good avalanche effect property and hence needs to be improved to satisfy with acceptable avalanche effect that would be robust against statistical-based cryptanalysis. We compare our results with the avalanche and bit independence criterion (BIC) performances of the conventional DRPE scheme, and improve the avalanche effect of DRPE in the discrete Gyrator domain by integrating a photon counting imaging technique. Although the Gyrator transform-based image cryptosystem has been studied, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a cryptographic evaluation of discrete Gyrator transform with avalanche and bit independence criterions."

The purpose of this study is to quantitatively analyze urban spatial structures and to derive the correlations between the computed measures and emergency transportation times in the case of cardiac arrests.  Methods : After reviewing precedent research documents, axial map was prepared with the centerlines of urban roads extracted from public geographic information data. The prepared data were used for axial map analysis. The overall analysis was performed in the range of district to reduce the boundary effects, which are distortions at the models boundary. Emergency transportation time in each dong(district) and the correlation between spatial structure measures and the produced time results also were analyzed.  Results : Emergency patients appear mostly in residential areas where many people live. The analysis result shows that transportation time is longer in commercial areas than in residential areas. Roads showing longer transportation time than others were either biased or poorly connected. Also, the analysis results show that the Integration measure and the Mean Depth measure are related to transportation time. If the Integration measure is low or the Mean Depth measure is high, the transportation time appears to be longer.  Conclusions  : This study reveals the relationship between the structure of urban space and transportation time. It also suggests that clinical facilities caring for emergency patients and their spatial allocations in urban areas are to be evaluated as parts of urban environments."

Designing a Non-invasive Surface Acoustic Resonator for Ultra-high Sensitive Ethanol Detection for an On-the-spot Health Monitoring System,2018,"['surface acoustic resonator', 'ethanol detection', 'non-invasive sensor', 'health monitoring system', 'numerical modeling']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors – based on piezoelectric crystal resonators – are extremely sensitive to even very small perturbations in the external atmosphere, because the energy associated with the acoustic waves is confined to the crystal surface. In this study, we present a critical review of the recent researches and developments predominantly used for SAW-based organic vapor sensors, especially ethanol. Besides highlighting their potential to realize real-time ethanol sensing, their drawbacks such as indirect sensing, invasive, time initializing, and low reliability, are properly discussed. The study investigates a proposed YZ-lithium niobate piezoelectric substrate with interdigital transducers patterned on the surface. Design of the resonator plays an important role in improving mass sensitivity, particularly the sensing area. Accordingly, a tin dioxide (SnO2) layer with a specific thickness is generated on the surface of the sensor because of its high affinity to ethanol molecules. To determine the values of sensor configuration without facing the practical problems and the long theoretical calculation time, it is shown that the mass sensitivity of SAW sensors can be calculated by a simple three-dimensional (3-D) finite element analysis (FEA) using a commercial finite-element platform. In design validation step, different concentrations of ethanol are applied to investigate the acoustic wave properties of the sensor. The FEA data are used to obtain the surface and bulk total displacements of the sensor and fast Fourier transform (FFT) on output spectrum.The sensor could develop into highly sensitive and fast responsive structure so that a positive intensity shift of 0.18e-2 RIU is observed when the sensor is exposed to 15 ppm ethanol. It is capable of continuously monitoring the ethanol gas whether as an ultra-high sensitive sensor or switching applications for medical and industrial purposes."
