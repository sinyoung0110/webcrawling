한국 전통문화 말뭉치구축 및 Bi-LSTM-CNN-CRF를 활용한 전통문화 개체명 인식 모델 개발,2018,"['개체명 인식', '전통문화', '말뭉치', '딥러닝', '자질 보강', 'Named Entity Recognition', 'Traditional culture', 'Corpus', 'Deep Learning', 'feature augmentation']","개체명 인식(Named Entity Recognition)시스템은 문서로부터 고유한 의미를 가질 수 있는 인명(PS), 지명(LC), 기관명(OG) 등의 개체명을 추출하고 추출된 개체명의 범주를 결정하는 시스템이다. 최근 딥러닝 방식을 이용한 개체명 인식 연구에서 입력 데이터의 앞, 뒤 방향을 고려한 LSTM 기반의 Bi-LSTM 모델로부터 출력 데이터 간의 전이 확률을 이용한 CRF를 결합한 방식의 Bi-LSTM-CRF가 우수한 성능을 보이고, 문자 및 단어 단위의 효율적인 임베딩 벡터생성에 관한 연구와 CNN, LSTM을 활용한 모델에서도 좋은 성능을 보여주고 있다. 본 연구에서는 한국어 개체명 인식시스템 성능 향상을 위해 자질을 보강한 Bi-LSTM-CNN-CRF 모델에 관해 기술하고 전통문화 말뭉치구축 방식에 대해 제안한다. 그리고 구축한 말뭉치를 한국어 개체명 인식 성능 향상을 위한 자질 보강 모델 Bi-LSTM-CNN-CRF로 학습한 결과에 대해 제안한다.","Named Entity Recognition is a system that extracts entity names such as Persons(PS), Locations(LC), and Organizations(OG) that can have a unique meaning from a document and determines the categories of extracted entity names.

Recurrent neural networks, which can store previous information in the hidden layer, are suitable for the stock price prediction model, which is time series data. In order to maintain the long - term dependency by solving the gradient vanish problem in the recurrent neural network, we use LSTM with small memory inside the recurrent neural network. Furthermore, we proposed the stock price prediction model using bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network in which the hidden layer is added in the reverse direction of the data flow for solving the limitation of the tendency of learning only based on the immediately preceding pattern of the recurrent neural network. In this experiment, we used the Tensorflow to learn the proposed stock price prediction model with stock price and trading volume input. In order to evaluate the performance of the stock price prediction, the mean square root error between the real stock price and the predicted stock price was obtained.

This research aims to predict water level of the tide dominated site, Jamsu bridge in the Han River downstream. Physics-based hydrodynamic approaches are sometimes not applicable for water level prediction in such a tidal river due to uncertainty sources like rainfall forecasting data. In this study, TensorFlow deep learning framework was used to build a deep neural network based LSTM model and its applications. The LSTM model was trained based on 3 data sets having 10-min temporal resolution: Paldang dam release, Jamsu bridge water level, predicted tidal level for 6 years (2011~2016) and then predict the water level time series given the six lead times: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 hours. The optimal hyper-parameters of LSTM model were set up as follows: 6 hidden layers number, 0.01 learning rate, 3000 iterations. In addition, we changed the key parameter of LSTM model, sequence length, ranging from 1 to 6 hours to test its affect to prediction results. The LSTM model with the 1 hr sequence length led to the best performing prediction results for the all cases. In particular, it resulted in very accurate prediction: RMSE (0.065 cm) and NSE (0.99) for the 1 hr lead time prediction case. However, as the lead time became longer, the RMSE increased from 0.08 m (1 hr lead time) to 0.28 m (24 hrs lead time) and the NSE decreased from 0.99 (1 hr lead time) to 0.74 (24 hrs lead time), respectively."

The model was established from the stress-strain data from uniaxial compression tests of silica-gypsum specimens. After training the model, it can predict the behavior of the material up to the failure state by using an early stage of stress-strain curve whose stress is very low. Because the LSTM neural network predict a value by using the previous state of data and proceed forward step by step, a higher error was found at the prediction of higher stress state due to the accumulation of error. However, this model generally predict the stress-strain curve with high accuracy. The accuracy of both LSTM and tangential prediction models increased with increased length of input data, while a difference in performance between them decreased as the amount of input data increased. LSTM model showed relatively superior performance to the tangential prediction when only few input data was given, which enhanced the necessity for application of the model."

Recently, the sentiment analysis methods have been widely used in many fields. As good examples, data-driven surveys are based on analyzing the subjectivity of text data posted by users and market researches are conducted by analyzing users’ review posts to quantify users’ reputation on a target product. The basic method of sentiment analysis is to use sentiment dictionary (or lexicon), a list of sentiment vocabularies with positive, neutral, or negative semantics. In general, the meaning of many sentiment words is likely to be different across domains. For example, a sentiment word, ‘sad’ indicates negative meaning in many fields but a movie.In order to perform accurate sentiment analysis, we need to build the sentiment dictionary for a given domain. However, such a method of building the sentiment lexicon is time-consuming and various sentiment vocabularies are not included without the use of general-purpose sentiment lexicon. In order to address this problem, several studies have been carried out to construct the sentiment lexicon suitable for a specific domain based on ‘OPEN HANGUL’ and ‘SentiWordNet’, which are general-purpose sentiment lexicons. However, OPEN HANGUL is no longer being serviced and SentiWordNet does not work well because of language difference in the process of converting Korean word into English word. There are restrictions on the use of such general-purpose sentiment lexicons as seed data for building the sentiment lexicon for a specific domain.In this article, we construct ‘KNU Korean Sentiment Lexicon (KNU-KSL)’, a new general-purpose Korean sentiment dictionary that is more advanced than existing general-purpose lexicons. The proposed dictionary, which is a list of domain-independent sentiment words such as ‘thank you’, ‘worthy’, and ‘impressed’, is built to quickly construct the sentiment dictionary for a target domain. Especially, it constructs sentiment vocabularies by analyzing the glosses contained in Standard Korean Language Dictionary (SKLD) by the following procedures: First, we propose a sentiment classification model based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM).Second, the proposed deep learning model automatically classifies each of glosses to either positive or negative meaning.Third, positive words and phrases are extracted from the glosses classified as positive meaning, while negative words and phrases are extracted from the glosses classified as negative meaning.Our experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed sentiment classification model is up to 89.45%. In addition, the sentiment dictionary is more extended using various external sources including SentiWordNet, SenticNet, Emotional Verbs, and Sentiment Lexicon 0603. Furthermore, we add sentiment information about frequently used coined words and emoticons that are used mainly on the Web. The KNU-KSL contains a total of 14,843 sentiment vocabularies, each of which is one of 1-grams, 2-grams, phrases, and sentence patterns. Unlike existing sentiment dictionaries, it is composed of words that are not affected by particular domains.The recent trend on sentiment analysis is to use deep learning technique without sentiment dictionaries. The importance of developing sentiment dictionaries is declined gradually. However, one of recent studies shows that the words in the sentiment dictionary can be used as features of deep learning models, resulting in the sentiment analysis performed with higher accuracy (Teng, Z., 2016). This result indicates that the sentiment dictionary is used not only for sentiment analysis but also as features of deep learning models for improving accuracy. The proposed dictionary can be used as a basic data for constructing the sentiment lexicon of a particular domain and as features of deep learnin..."

We focus on the fact that the sequential images during the tension are generated and the displacement of the specimen is represented in the image data. So, we designed sample generation model which makes sequential images of specimen. The behavior of generated images are similar to the real specimen images under tensile force. Using generated images, we trained and validated our model. In the deep neural network, sequential images are assigned to a multi-channel input to train the network. The multi-channel images are composed of sequential images obtained along the time domain. As a result, the neural network learns the temporal information as the images express the correlation with each other along the time domain. In order to verify the proposed method, we conducted experiments by comparing the deformation measuring performance of the neural network changing the displacement range of images."

온톨로지 지식 기반 특성치를 활용한 Bidirectional LSTM-CRF 모델의 시퀀스 태깅 성능 향상에 관한 연구,2018,"['시퀀스 태깅', 'CRF(Conditional Random Field)', 'LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)', '질의응답 시스템', '온톨로지', 'Sequence Tagging', 'QA System', 'Ontology']",,"This paper proposes a methodology applying sequence tagging methodology to improve the performance of NER(Named Entity Recognition) used in QA system. In order to retrieve the correct answers stored in the database, it is necessary to switch the user’s query into a language of the database such as SQL(Structured Query Language). Then, the computer can recognize the language of the user. This is the process of identifying the class or data name contained in the database. The method of retrieving the words contained in the query in the existing database and recognizing the object based on the index does not identify the homophone and the word phrases because it does not consider the context of the user’s query. If there are multiple search results, all of them are returned as a result, so there can be many interpretations on the query and the time complexity for the calculation becomes large. In addition, in the existing QA system, chunking has a higher probability of selecting the longest phrase among the sentence component phrases retrieved after obtaining a subset of all cases that can come from the user query. This chunking process has a problem that the algorithm is complicated, but it is not always correct according to the query. To overcome these, this study aims to solve this problem by reflecting the contextual meaning of the query using neural network-based methodology and to identify the problem of the neural network based methodology. Context-sensitive tagging combined with CRF and Bidirectional LSTM can be used to supplement the LSTM-based model, which can limit long-term memory problems, but can be biased toward recent input because of the data nature of word embedding. Therefore, we have solved the disadvantages of the neural network model by introducing the latest technology Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model in Sequence Tagging field. We used reasoning that reflects context by using ontology-based characteristic values for untrained words. In case that untrained words come in, we store the object name recognition tag information obtained from the ontology knowledge base in the Lucene index DB as the ontology knowledge based feature. and In this paper, we propose a neural network model based on ontology knowledge based feature.  Experiments were conducted on the ontology knowledge base of music domain and the performance was evaluated. In order to accurately evaluate the performance of the L-Bidirectional LSTM-CRF proposed in this study, we experimented with converting the words included in the learned query into untrained words in order to test whether the words were included in the database but correctly identified the untrained words. Through experimentation, it was confirmed that tag recognition based on the context of the homophone and chunking is possible. In addition, we could apply the features that match the data type by using the CRF property which can use user defined function as a variable. As a result, it was possible to recognize objects considering the context and can recognize the untrained words without re-training the L-Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model, and it is confirmed that the performance of the object recognition as a whole is improved. Therefore, the proposed L-Bidirectional LSTM-CRF methodology can be applied to the ontology knowledge base of various fields to solve the object name recognition problem. However, the proposed L-Bidirectional LSTM-CRF method performed better than the conventional LSTM-CRF method, but lacked the ability to process homophones compared to the conventional Bidirectional LSTM-CRF. This is due to the fact that the hypothesis of this study inserts a feature that can infer a pattern of unknown words based on the entity name pattern of trained queries. This is because the weight increases linearly with the inclusion in the training data. In future research, it is necessary to experiment with various methods of applying weights so that homophones can be found well while ma"

This research aims to predict water level of the tide dominated site, Jamsu bridge in the Han River downstream. Physics-based hydrodynamic approaches are sometimes not applicable for water level prediction in such a tidal river due to uncertainty sources like rainfall forecasting data. In this study, TensorFlow deep learning framework was used to build a deep neural network based LSTM model and its applications. The LSTM model was trained based on 3 data sets having 10-min temporal resolution: Paldang dam release, Jamsu bridge water level, predicted tidal level for 6 years (2011~2016) and then predict the water level time series given the six lead times: 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 hours. The optimal hyper-parameters of LSTM model were set up as follows: 6 hidden layers number, 0.01 learning rate, 3000 iterations. In addition, we changed the key parameter of LSTM model, sequence length, ranging from 1 to 6 hours to test its affect to prediction results. The LSTM model with the 1 hr sequence length led to the best performing prediction results for the all cases. In particular, it resulted in very accurate prediction: RMSE (0.065 cm) and NSE (0.99) for the 1 hr lead time prediction case. However, as the lead time became longer, the RMSE increased from 0.08 m (1 hr lead time) to 0.28 m (24 hrs lead time) and the NSE decreased from 0.99 (1 hr lead time) to 0.74 (24 hrs lead time), respectively."

We are then to investigate whether reading-times on words in a sentence are predicted by information-theoretic measures such as surprisal and entropy reduction. Specifically, the proposed LSTM deep-learning model is first to be trained on the large dataset of learner English sentences and is then to be applied to estimate the two different information-theoretic measures on each word of the test data of English sentences. The reading times on the words in the test data are to be collected from the Korean English L2 learners reading the test sentences. A comparison between the information-theoretic measures and reading-times by using a linear mixed effect model reveals a reliable relationship between surprisal/entropy reduction and reading time. We conclude that both surprisal and entropy reduction are positively related to the processing effort (i.e. reading time), confirming the surprisal/entropy-reduction hypothesis."

Direct damages such as building collapse, human casualties, and loss of farms and fields have more attention from people than indirect damages such as increase of consumer prices. But indirect damages also need to be considered for living. The agricultural products are typical consumer items affected by typhoons and floods. Sudden, powerful typhoons are mostly accompanied by heavy rains and damage agricultural products; this increases the retail price of such products. This study analyzes the influence of natural disasters on the price of agricultural products by using a deep learning algorithm. We decided rice, onion, green onion, spinach, and zucchini as target agricultural products, and used data on variables that influence the price of agricultural products to create a model that predicts the price of agricultural products. The result shows that the model’s accuracy was about 0.069 measured by RMSE, which means that it could explain the changes in agricultural product prices. The accurate prediction on the price of agricultural products can be utilized by the government to respond natural disasters by controling amount of supplying agricultural products."

Before the Asian financial crisis, the Korean government only analyzed SMEs and tried to improve the forecasting power of a default prediction model, rather than developing various corporate default models. As a result, even large corporations called 'chaebol enterprises' become bankrupt. Even after that, the analysis of past corporate defaults has been focused on specific variables, and when the government restructured immediately after the global financial crisis, they only focused on certain main variables such as 'debt ratio'.A multifaceted study of corporate default prediction models is essential to ensure diverse interests, to avoid situations like the 'Lehman Brothers Case' of the global financial crisis, to avoid total collapse in a single moment.The key variables used in corporate defaults vary over time. This is confirmed by Beaver (1967, 1968) and Altman’s (1968) analysis that Deakins'(1972) study shows that the major factors affecting corporate failure have changed. In Grice's (2001) study, the importance of predictive variables was also found through Zmijewski’s (1984) and Ohlson’s (1980) models. However, the studies that have been carried out in the past use static models. Most of them do not consider the changes that occur in the course of time. Therefore, in order to construct consistent prediction models, it is necessary to compensate the time-dependent bias by means of a time series analysis algorithm reflecting dynamic change.Based on the global financial crisis, which has had a significant impact on Korea, this study is conducted using 10 years of annual corporate data from 2000 to 2009. Data are divided into training data, validation data, and test data respectively, and are divided into 7, 2, and 1 years respectively. In order to construct a consistent bankruptcy model in the flow of time change, we first train a time series deep learning algorithm model using the data before the financial crisis (2000~2006). The parameter tuning of the existing model and the deep learning time series algorithm is conducted with validation data including the financial crisis period (2007~2008). As a result, we construct a model that shows similar pattern to the results of the learning data and shows excellent prediction power. After that, each bankruptcy prediction model is restructured by integrating the learning data and validation data again (2000 ~ 2008), applying the optimal parameters as in the previous validation. Finally, each corporate default prediction model is evaluated and compared using test data (2009) based on the trained models over nine years. Then, the usefulness of the corporate default prediction model based on the deep learning time series algorithm is proved. In addition, by adding the Lasso regression analysis to the existing methods (multiple discriminant analysis, logit model) which select the variables, it is proved that the deep learning time series algorithm model based on the three bundles of variables is useful for robust corporate default prediction.The definition of bankruptcy used is the same as that of Lee (2015). Independent variables include financial information such as financial ratios used in previous studies. Multivariate discriminant analysis, logit model, and Lasso regression model are used to select the optimal variable group. The influence of the Multivariate discriminant analysis model proposed by Altman (1968), the Logit model proposed by Ohlson (1980), the non-time series machine learning algorithms, and the deep learning time series algorithms are compared.In the case of corporate data, there are limitations of 'nonlinear variables', 'multi-collinearity' of variables, and 'lack of data'.

The SWAT model was set up based on globally-available database (topography: HydroSHED, landuse: GLCF-MODIS, soil: FAO-Soil map, rainfall: APHRODITE, etc) and then simulated daily discharge from 2003 to 2007. The LSTM was built using deep learning open-source library TensorFlow and the deep-layer neural networks of the LSTM were trained based merely on daily water level data of 10 upper stations of the Kratie during two periods: 2000~2002 and 2008~2014. Then, LSTM simulated daily discharge for 2003~2007 as in SWAT model. The simulation results show that Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of each model were calculated at 0.9(SWAT) and 0.99(LSTM), respectively. In order to simply simulate hydrological time series of ungauged large watersheds, data-driven model like the LSTM method is more applicable than the physics-based hydrological model having complexity due to various database pressure because it is able to memorize the preceding time series sequences and reflect them to prediction."

The proposed methodology is divided into the following steps. 1) Collect relevant documents from Wikipedia, Naver encyclopedia, and Naver news sources for “subject-predicate“ separated queries and classify the proper documents. 2) Determine whether the sentence is suitable for extracting information and derive the confidence. 3) Based on the predicate feature, extract the information in the proper sentence and derive the overall confidence of the information extraction result.In order to evaluate the performance of the information extraction system, we selected 400 queries from the artificial intelligence speaker of SK-Telecom. Compared with the baseline model, it is confirmed that it shows higher performance index than the existing model.The contribution of this study is that we develop a sequence tagging model based on bi-directional LSTM-CRF using the predicate feature of the query, with this we developed a robust model that can maintain high recall performance even in various types of unstructured documents collected from multiple sources. The problem of information extraction for knowledge base extension should take into account heterogeneous characteristics of source-specific document types. The proposed methodology proved to extract information effectively from various types of unstructured documents compared to the baseline model. There is a limitation in previous research that the performance is poor when extracting information about the document type that is different from the training data.In addition, this study can prevent unnecessary information extraction attempts from the documents that do not include the answer information through the process for predicting the suitability of information extraction of documents and sentences before the information extraction step. It is meaningful that we provided a method that precision performance can be maintained even in actual web environment. The information extraction problem for the knowledge base expansion has the characteristic that it can not guarantee whether the document includes the correct answer because it is aimed at the unstructured document existing in the real web. When the question answering is performed on a real web, previous machine reading comprehension studies has a limitation that it shows a low level of precision because it frequently attempts to extract an answer even in a document in which there is no correct answer. The policy that predicts the suitability of document and sentence information extraction is meaningful in that it contributes to maintaining the performance of information extraction even in real web environment.The limitations of this study and future research directions are as follows. First, it is a problem related to data preprocessing. In this study, the unit of knowledge extraction is classified through the morphological analysis based on the open source Konlpy python package, and the information extraction result can be improperly performed because morphological analysis is not performed properly. To enhance the performance of information extraction results, it is necessary to develop an advanced morpheme analyzer.Second, it is a problem of entity ambiguity. The information extraction system of this study can not distinguish the same name that has different intention. If several people with the same name appear in the news, the system may not extract information about the intended query. In future research, it is necessary to take measures to identify the person with the same name.Third, it is a problem of evaluation query data.

To do so, machine learning methods, such as support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting regression tree, deep neural networks, and long short term memory networks (LSTM), and the time series analysis methods such as the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), the vector autoregression model (VAR), and the Bayesian vector autoregressive model (Bayesian VAR), were used to predict the real estate price index for apartments. The following were the main findings of the comparison of their predictive abilities. First, the predictive power of machine learning methods is superior to that of the time series analysis methods. Second, in a stable market situation, both machine learning and time series analysis methods can predict market trends moderately well.

In this study, we propose story learning/regeneration frameworks from videos with successive event order supervision for contextual coherence. The supervision induces each episode to have a form of trajectory in the latent space, which constructs a composite representation of ordering and semantics. In this study, we incorporated the use of kids videos as a training data. Some of the advantages associated with the kids videos include omnibus style, simple/explicit storyline in short, chronological narrative order, and relatively limited number of characters and spatial environments. We build the encoder-decoder structure with successive event order embedding, and train bi-directional LSTMs as sequence models considering multi-step sequence prediction. Using a series of approximately 200 episodes of kids videos named ‘Pororo the Little Penguin’, we give empirical results for story regeneration tasks and SEOE. In addition, each episode shows a trajectory-like shape on the latent space of the model, which gives the geometric information for the sequence models."

Information of hydrologic feature like streamflow of the Mekong river are required for water disaster prevention and sustainable water resources development in the river sharing countries. In this study, runoff simulations at the Kratie station of the lower Mekong river are performed using SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), a physics-based hydrologic model, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a data-driven deep learning algorithm. The SWAT model was set up based on globally-available database (topography: HydroSHED, landuse: GLCF-MODIS, soil: FAO-Soil map, rainfall: APHRODITE, etc) and then simulated daily discharge from 2003 to 2007. The LSTM was built using deep learning open-source library TensorFlow and the deep-layer neural networks of the LSTM were trained based merely on daily water level data of 10 upper stations of the Kratie during two periods: 2000~2002 and 2008~2014. Then, LSTM simulated daily discharge for 2003~2007 as in SWAT model. The simulation results show that Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of each model were calculated at 0.9(SWAT) and 0.99(LSTM), respectively. In order to simply simulate hydrological time series of ungauged large watersheds, data-driven model like the LSTM method is more applicable than the physics-based hydrological model having complexity due to various database pressure because it is able to memorize the preceding time series sequences and reflect them to prediction."

A Deep-Learning Based Model for Emotional Evaluation of Video Clips,2018,"['Video emotion analysis', 'C3D', 'Transfer learning', 'LSTM']",,"Emotional evaluation of video clips is the difficult task because it includes not only stationary objects as the background but also dynamic objects as the foreground. In addition, there are many video analysis problems to be solved beforehand to properly address the emotionrelated tasks. Recently, however, the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning approach, opens the possibility by solving the action recognition problem. Inspired by the CNN-based action recognition technology, this paper challenges to evaluate the emotion of video clips. In the paper, we propose a deep learning model to capture the video features and evaluate the emotion of a video clip on Thayer 2D emotion space. In the model, the pre-trained convolutional 3D neural network (C3D) generates short-term spatiotemporal features of the video, LSTM accumulates those consecutive time-varying features to characterize long-term dynamic behaviors, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) evaluates emotion of a video clip by regression on the emotion space. Due to the limited number of labeled data, the C3D is employed to extract diverse spatiotemporal from various layers by transfer learning technique. The pre-trained C3D on the Sports-1M dataset and long short term memory (LSTM) followed by the MLP for regression are trained in end-to-end manner to fine-tune the C3D, and to adjust weights of LSTM and the MLP-type emotion estimator. The proposed method achieves the concordance correlation coefficient values of 0.6024 for valence and 0.6460 for arousal, respectively. We believe this emotional evaluation of video could be easily associated with appropriate music recommendation, once the music is emotionally evaluated in the same high-level emotional space."

CNNs require that the text retain some order, that the pooling lengths be identical, and that collateral analysis is impossible; In case of LSTM, it requires the unidirectional operation and the inputs/outputs are very complex. Against these problems, we thus improved these traditional deep learning methods in the following ways: We created collateral CNNs accepting disorder and variable-length pooling, and we removed the input/output gates when creating bidirectional LSTMs. We have used four benchmark datasets for topic and sentiment classification using the new methods that we propose. The best results were obtained by combining LTSM regional embeddings with data convolution.

Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms,2018,"['Deep learning', 'Diabetes', 'Heart rate variability', 'ECG', 'CNN', 'LSTM']",,"Diabetes is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%."
Recognition of Natural Hand Gestures Using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Model,2018,"['Bidirectional LSTM', 'Hand gesture recognition', 'Natural hand motion', 'Recognition of direction command']",,"Recent studies have been trying to use voices and body gestures similar to human communication methods to control intelligent devices such as robots instead of giving commands using a keyboard or a mouse. Human being obtains about 80% of information using vision, and about 55% of all meaning of communication is related to vision. In addition, hand gestures are most frequently used in non-verbal communication. Therefore, there have been many researches to give commands to a robot. Existing studies were limited to recognition of fixed hand gestures and shapes, requiring users to be educated on motions that can be used to communicate with robots. To solve this problem, we use fuzzy inference to select meaningful gesture in continuous gesture at first. Hand position is interpolated using the Lagrangian method. Also, we use the Kalman filter for object-occlusion or self-occlusion. After generating a sequence of continuously received hand positions using a chain code, the fuzzy theory is used to select meaningful motions among various hand gestures. Eventually, we perform a method of recognizing meaningful hand gestures using a recurrent neural network with bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. Even though selecting the meaningful motion was hard, if it was selected correctly, the ratio of hand gesture recognition was very high in experiment results."

The deep learning method used in this paper uses a learning model of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) structure that processes time series data. In the computer simulation, the generated power consumption data was learned, and the power consumption was predicted based on the learned model. We calculate the error between the actual and predicted power consumption amount, resulting in an error rate of 21.37%.

The preliminary researches of sentiment analysis identify sentiments by using the dictionary which contains negative and positive words collected in advance. As researches on deep learning are actively carried out, sentiment analysis using deep learning model with morpheme or word unit has been done. However, this model has disadvantages in that the word dictionary varies according to the domain and the number of morphemes or words gets relatively larger than that of phonemes. Therefore, the size of the dictionary becomes large and the complexity of the model increases accordingly.We construct a sentiment analysis model using recurrent neural network by dividing input data into phoneme-level which is smaller than morpheme-level. To verify the performance, we use 30,000 movie reviews from the Korean biggest portal, Naver. Morpheme-level sentiment analysis model is also implemented and compared. As a result, the phoneme- level sentiment analysis model is superior to that of the morpheme-level, and in particular, the phoneme-level model using LSTM performs better than that of using GRU model. It is expected that Korean text processing based on a phoneme-level model can be applied to various text mining and language models."

The goal of this research was to design a deep learning framework and model to classify arousal and valence, indicating positive and negative degrees of emotion as high or low. Methods: The proposed arousal and valence classification model to analyze the affective state was tested using data from 40 channels provided by a dataset for emotion analysis using electrocardiography (EEG), physiological, and video signals (the DEAP dataset). Experiments were based on 10 selected featured central and peripheral nervous system data points, using long short-term memory (LSTM) as a deep learning method. Results: The arousal and valence were classified and visualized on a two-dimensional coordinate plane. Profiles were designed depending on the number of hidden layers, nodes, and hyperparameters according to the error rate. The experimental results show an arousal and valence classification model accuracy of 74.65 and 78%, respectively.The proposed model performed better than previous other models. Conclusions: The proposed model appears to be effective in analyzing arousal and valence; specifically, it is expected that affective analysis using physiological signals based on LSTM will be possible without manual feature extraction.

Basically, the personalization algorithm makes users have a narrower perspective and even stronger bias because users have less chances to get views of opponent. Eli Pariser called this problem the ‘filter bubble’ in his book. It is important to understand exactly what a filter bubble is to solve the problem. Therefore, this paper shows how much Google’s personalized search algorithm influences search result through an experiment with deep neural networks acting like users. At the beginning of the experiment, two Google accounts are newly created, not to be influenced by the Google’s personalized search algorithm. Then the two pure accounts get politically biased by two methods. We periodically calculate the numerical score depending on the character of links and it shows how biased the account is. In conclusion, this paper shows the formation process of filter bubble by a personalization algorithm through the experiment."
DeepAct: A Deep Neural Network Model for Activity Detection in Untrimmed Videos,2018,"['Activity Detection', 'Bi-directional LSTM', 'Deep Neural Networks', 'Untrimmed Video']",,"We propose a novel deep neural network model for detecting human activities in untrimmed videos. The process of human activity detection in a video involves two steps: a step to extract features that are effective in recognizing human activities in a long untrimmed video, followed by a step to detect human activities from those extracted features. To extract the rich features from video segments that could express unique patterns for each activity, we employ two different convolutional neural network models, C3D and I-ResNet. For detecting human activities from the sequence of extracted feature vectors, we use BLSTM, a bi-directional recurrent neural network model. By conducting experiments with ActivityNet 200, a large-scale benchmark dataset, we show the high performance of the proposed DeepAct model."
Detects abnormal behavior using motor power consumption,2018,"['Motor', 'AI', 'Prediction', 'Intrusion Detection', 'Smart Factory']",,"In this paper, we used LSTM as a method to detect abnormal behavior of motors. We fixed the high layout size to 1 and changed the range of the input values and the neural network structure to see what change in power consumption prediction. Now, as the fourth industrial revolution era, smart factories are attracting attention. All the physical actions of smart factories are done using motors. Continuous monitoring of motor malfunctions helps to detect malfunctions and efficient operation. However, it is difficult to acquire the power consumption constantly due to the influence of the noise. We have experimented with a simple experimental environment, a method of predicting similarity to input data by adjusting the range of the input data or by changing the neural network structure."

Deep Neural Architecture for Recovering Dropped Pronouns in Korean,2018,"['Deep learning', 'Dropped pronoun recovery', 'LSTM Encoding', 'Zero pronoun.']",,"Pronouns are frequently dropped in Korean sentences, especially in text messages in the mobile phone environment. Restoring dropped pronouns can be a beneficial preprocessing task for machine translation, information extraction, spoken dialog systems, and many other applications. In this work, we address the problem of dropped pronoun recovery by resolving two simultaneous subtasks: detecting zero‐pronoun sentences and determining the type of dropped pronouns. The problems are statistically modeled by encoding the sentence and classifying types of dropped pronouns using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Various RNN‐based encoding architectures were investigated, and the stacked RNN was shown to be the best model for Korean zero‐pronoun recovery. The proposed method does not require any manual features to be implemented; nevertheless, it shows good performance."

In this study, we investigate various techniques and cases to predict call volume and develop and verify optimized models. We develop the call prediction model by using decomposition model, ARIMA model, regression model and artificial neural network based model, and fitting of optimized prediction model by using real call center data and verify its effectiveness."
AI Anaalysis Method Utilizing Ingestible Bio-Sensors for Bovine Calving Predictions,2018,"['bovine parturition/calving', 'body temperature', 'ingestible sensor', 'deep learning', 'LSTM-FCN']",,"Parturition is an important event for farmers as it provides economic gains for the farms. Thus, the effectivemanagement of parturition is essential to farm management. In particular, the unit price of cattle is higher than otherlivestock and the productivity of cattle is closely associated to farm income. In addition, 42% of calving occurs inthe nighttime so accurate parturition predictions are all the more important. In this paper, we propose a method thataccurately predicts the calving date by applying core body temperature of cattle to deep learning. The bodytemperature of cattle can be measured without being influenced by the ambient environment by applying an ingestiblebio-sensor in the cattle’s rumen. By experiment on cattle, we confirmed this method to be more accurate forpredicting calving dates than existing parturition prediction methods, showing an average of 3 hour 40 minute error.This proposed method is expected to reduce the economic damages of farms by accurately predicting calving timesand assisting in successful parturitions."

The optimal model was found and the estimation results with that were assessed."
Recurrent Neural Network를 활용한 서비스 이벤트 관계 분석에 관한 연구,2018,"['Event Correlation Analysis', 'IT Service', 'Long Short Term Memory', 'Recurrent Neural Network', 'Root Cause Analysis']",,"Enterprises need to monitor systems for reliable IT service operations to quickly detect and respond to events affecting the service, thereby preventing failures. Events in non-critical systems can be seen as a precursor to critical system incidents. Therefore, event relationship analysis in the operation of IT services can proactively recognize and prevent faults by identifying non-critical events and their relationships with incidents.This study used the Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory techniques to create a model to analyze event relationships in a system and to verify which models are suitable for analyzing event relationships. Verification has shown that both models are capable of analyzing event relationships and that RNN models are more suitable than LSTM models. Based on the pattern of events occurring, this model is expected to support the prediction of the next occurrence of events and help identify the root cause of incidents to help prevent failures and improve the quality of IT services."
내부정보유출 위험등급 판단을 위한 딥 러닝 모델 성능비교에 관한 연구,2018,"['보안', '빅데이터', '보안로그', '이벤트', '내부정보 유출 방지', '위험관리', 'Insider Data Leakage', 'Risk classification', 'Deep Learning', 'Performance Comparison']",,"Recently, there has been an increase in the leakage of internal information in the companies. Most of the internal information leakage is caused by insiders. Companies are applying several security solutions to prevent this. However, there is still a lack of research on solutions applying deep learning to detection of data leakage with limitations in preventing leakage in advance. In this paper, a method to judge internal data leakage risk classification is proposed by applying various deep learning models. Security events are generated for each user by mapping the security log and user information obtained through the security device to determine the risk of internal information leakage. Training data based on the mapped data is generated, and applied to deep learning models such as MLP, LSTM, and GRU to compare the performance between models. In addition, the number of hidden nodes and the activation function are changed and their effects are examined. Experimental results showed that the model with softmax activation function applied to the GRU model without dropout showed the highest performance and 93% accuracy."

However, these studies have indicated a fundamental shortcoming of machine learning models since they are unable to reflect a long span of past information. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a human intention prediction model based on a recurrent neural network(RNN). For performing predictions, the RNN model classifies the patterns of time-series data by reflecting previous sequence patterns of the time-series data. For performing intention prediction using the proposed model, an RNN model was trained to classify predefined intentions by using attributes such as time, location, activity and detected objects in a house. Each RNN node is composed of a long short-term memory cell to solve the long term dependency problem. To evaluate the proposed intention prediction model, a data generator based on the weighted-graph structure has been developed for generating data on a daily basis. By incorporating 23,000 data instances for training and testing the proposed intention prediction model, a prediction accuracy value of 90.52% was achieved."

This paper proposes a method for classifying human emotions through multiple neural networks based on multi-modal signals which consist of image, landmark, and audio in a wild environment. The proposed method has the following features. First, the learning performance of the image-based network is greatly improved by employing both multi-task learning and semi-supervised learning using the spatio-temporal characteristic of videos. Second, a model for converting 1-dimensional (1D) landmark information of face into two-dimensional (2D) images, is newly proposed, and a CNN-LSTM network based on the model is proposed for better emotion recognition. Third, based on an observation that audio signals are often very effective for specific emotions, we propose an audio deep learning mechanism robust to the specific emotions. Finally, so-called emotion adaptive fusion is applied to enable synergy of multiple networks. The proposed network improves emotion classification performance by appropriately integrating existing supervised learning and semi-supervised learning networks. In the fifth attempt on the given test set in the EmotiW2017 challenge, the proposed method achieved a classification accuracy of 57.12%."
