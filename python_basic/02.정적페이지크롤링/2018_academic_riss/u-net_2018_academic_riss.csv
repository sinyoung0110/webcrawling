물체 변형 성능을 향상하기 위한 U-net 및 Residual 기반의Cycle-GAN,2018,"['Deep learning', 'AI', 'Image-to-image translation', 'CNN', 'GAN']",,"The image-to-image translation is one of the deep learning applications using image data. In this paper, we aim at improving the performance of object transfiguration which transforms a specific object in an image into another specific object. For object transfiguration, it is required to transform only the target object and maintain background images. In the existing results, however, it is observed that other parts in the image are also transformed. In this paper, we have focused on the structure of artificial neural networks that are frequently used in the existing methods and have improved the performance by adding constraints to the exiting structure. We also propose the advanced structure that combines the existing structures to maintain their advantages and complement their drawbacks. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are shown in experimental results."

Such forest disasters can occur randomly and develop rapidly, so the in-situ observations may be limited spatially and temporally. As an alternative, satellite remote sensing is an effective method for detecting forest disasters. This paper described the development of a forest disaster detection method by combining the existing spectral methods and a state-of-the-art deep learning technique. NBR(Normalized Burned Ratio), BAI(Burn Area Index), and FBI(Fire Burn Index), which are mainly used fire damage indices, were applied to seven forest fires cases together with the satellite images from Kompsat-3A, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 5. The existing spectral methods have limitation of threshold adjustment for each region and for each season. To mitigate this problem, we used the FCN(Fully Convolutional Network)-based U-Net model, which produced more effective detectability of forest fire damages. For future work, the result of spectral methods and several deep learning techniques can be compared quantitatively to prove the performance of U-Net model objectively."

This is the very opposite decision of the net neutrality rule that the Obama administration has consistently maintained. The ensuing storm from the repeal of net neutrality protections has an extensively effect enough on individuals and businesses to cover the entire spectrum, and the impact is hard to assess in the U. S. content industry, which dominates the worldwide Internet content and platform market. On the other hand, Korea’s net neutrality protections have been firmly pursued, and there is no sign of change even after the decision happened in the U. S. Net neutrality is not a simple theme that is associated with the Constitution, such as freedom of expression, as well as the issue of network enhancement to prepare for 5G. Accordingly, this study examines how the net neutrality has been carried out in the U.

The electricity generated by new & renewable energy system with the form of distributed generation is preferentially supplied to electrical demand, and surplus electricity is transmitted back to grid. Due to the recent expansion of houses with photovoltaic system and the nZEH mandatory by 2025, the rapid increase of distributed generation is expected. Which means, we must prepare for an electricity-power accident and stable electricity supply. Also electricity charges have to be reduce and the grid-connected should be operated efficiently. The introduction of ESS is suggested as a solution, so the analysis of the load matching and grid interaction is required to optimize ESS design. This study analyzed the load matching and grid interaction by expected consumption behavior using actual data measured in one-minute intervals. The experiment was conducted in three nZEH with photovoltaic system, called all-electric houses. LCF (Load Cover Factor), SCF (Supply Cover Factor) and f grid (Grid Interaction Index) were evaluated as an analysis indicator.

In Korea, where the appraisal proceedings for the listed company and the unlisted company are regulated differently by Commercial Act and Financial Investment Service and Capital Market Act, the Supreme Court used the method, which is similar to the Delaware Block Method, reflecting the market value, net asset value, and earnings value to determine the fair value of shares of the unlisted company in the appraisal proceeding, though it still emphasized that there is no single specific standard or method for the fair value analysis, and, instead, all relevant factors, such as the situation of the company and the nature of the business, should be considered. In terms of the listed company, the Supreme Court mostly held that the fair value should be estimated by the market price of the company exclusive of any effect from the accomplishment or expectation of the deal.

Therapeutic interventions used in the articles included exercise therapy (8, 61.5%), physiotherapy and occupational therapy (2, 15.4%), complementary therapies (2, 15.4%), and music therapy (1, 7.7%). As a result of the qualitative evaluation of the papers using a checklist of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network, two studies scored 9 out of 10 points, five studies scored 8 out of 10, and six studies scored 7 out of 10. Intervention sessions were conducted for 55 minutes, on average, for a total of 37 sessions. This study found that exercise, music therapy, physical and occupational therapy, and rhythmic motion therapy were effective in preventing falling in the elderly with dementia. In the future, these findings are expected to be used as a basis for the development of a preventive intervention program for nurses in a clinical setting."

Methods: Studies Thirty-four studies selected from http://www.riss4u.net over the for last20 years were analyzed by field and design of the study, study participants, and the outcome variables used in intervention studies. Results: Nineteen (55.9%) of the 34 studies were conducted in the fields of welfare (9), psychology (5) and nursing science (5). Ordinary adolescents were the most frequently studied participants. A nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design was used in twenty one (61.7%) of the 34 studies. The most frequently measured outcome variables were depression, suicidal ideation and self-esteem. Conclusion: These results suggest that research on adolescent suicide intervention programs is expanding with a focus on ordinary adolescents as and subjects. In order to prevent suicide, research on family, teachers, and friends, who all are important parts of a teenager’s support system, is needed. It is also necessary to develop a post-management intervention program to prevent recurrence in high-risk teenagers who have attempted suicide."
