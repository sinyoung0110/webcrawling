물체 변형 성능을 향상하기 위한 U-net 및 Residual 기반의Cycle-GAN,2018,"['Deep learning', 'AI', 'Image-to-image translation', 'CNN', 'GAN']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The image-to-image translation is one of the deep learning applications using image data. In this paper, we aim at improving the performance of object transfiguration which transforms a specific object in an image into another specific object. For object transfiguration, it is required to transform only the target object and maintain background images. In the existing results, however, it is observed that other parts in the image are also transformed. In this paper, we have focused on the structure of artificial neural networks that are frequently used in the existing methods and have improved the performance by adding constraints to the exiting structure. We also propose the advanced structure that combines the existing structures to maintain their advantages and complement their drawbacks. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are shown in experimental results."
3D U-Net을 이용한 비등방성(non-isotropic) 의료 영상의 등방성(isotropic) 의료 영상으로의 변환기법 연구,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images are widely used for diagnostic and medical imaging studies related to brain diseases. However, FLAIR images are often inappropriate for research aims, since their spatial resolution in the z-axis is lower than the other two axes to reduce the acquisition time in most hospitals. Thus, conversion from non-isotropic FLAIR images to isotropic FLAIR images is quite useful. On the other hands, since the medical image is often required to be high-resolution, and thus the size of image is quite large. It causes memory space deficiency for analysis medical images using deep learning, which must be solved for medical image research. In this study, we employed and modified U-net that is widely used for super-resolution applications. We not only restored images that were not obtained, but also suggested a solution for memory deficiency for handling large-sized medical images."

Framing U-Net via Deep Convolutional Framelets: Application to Sparse-View CT,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>X-ray computed tomography (CT) using sparse projection views is a recent approach to reduce the radiation dose. However, due to the insufficient projection views, an analytic reconstruction approach using the filtered back projection (FBP) produces severe streaking artifacts. Recently, deep learning approaches using large receptive field neural networks such as U-Net have demonstrated impressive performance for sparse-view CT reconstruction. However, theoretical justification is still lacking. Inspired by the recent theory of <I>deep convolutional framelets</I>, the main goal of this paper is, therefore, to reveal the limitation of U-Net and propose new multi-resolution deep learning schemes. In particular, we show that the alternative U-Net variants such as dual frame and tight frame U-Nets satisfy the so-called frame condition which makes them better for effective recovery of high frequency edges in sparse-view CT. Using extensive experiments with real patient data set, we demonstrate that the new network architectures provide better reconstruction performance.</P>"
Detection of Phalange Region Based on U-Net,2018,"['Computer Aided Diagnosis', 'Segmentation', 'Deep Convolutional Neural Network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Osteoporosis is one of the famous bone diseases. It is a major cause of deteriorating the quality of life, and early detection and early treatment are becoming socially important. Visual screening using Computed Radiography (CR) images is effective for diagnosis of osteoporosis, but there are problems of increasing the burden on doctors, variation in diagnostic results due to differences in experiences of doctors, and undetected lesions. In order to solve this problem, we are working on a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for osteoporosis. In this paper, we propose segmentation methods of the phalange region from the phalangeal CR images as a preprocessing of classification of osteoporosis. In the proposed method, we construct a segmentation model using U-Net, which is a type of deep convolution neural network (DCNN). The proposed method was applied to input images generated from CR images of 101 patients with both hands, and evaluated using the Intersection over Union (IoU) values. The result was 0.914 in IoU."
Heterogeneity and Netting Efficiency under Central Clearing : A Stochastic Network Analysis,2018,"['Central Clearing', 'Exposure Distribution', 'Netting Efficiency', 'Heterogeneity', 'Simulation', 'Stochastic Network Model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper examines the effect of heterogeneity in exposures between banks on the netting efficiency under central clearing. Our network model specifies the prenetted interbank exposures as a joint stochastic process that shapes cross-correlation of asymmetric distributions. Employing OTC derivatives market data provided by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, we analyze how the correlation between interbank exposure distributions and the dispersion in bank sizes affect multilateral netting efficiency in the presence of a central clearing counterparty across various bank-specific resiliency and volatility parameters. Our simulation results indicate that the multilateral netting benefit under central clearing outweighs the bilateral reduction of expected exposures within an environment of systemic homogeneity in the distributions of interbank exposure dynamics. Furthermore, we find that policymakers should incentivize individual banks to enhance the resiliency and stability of their management of interbank exposures in a less homogeneous way."

Such forest disasters can occur randomly and develop rapidly, so the in-situ observations may be limited spatially and temporally. As an alternative, satellite remote sensing is an effective method for detecting forest disasters. This paper described the development of a forest disaster detection method by combining the existing spectral methods and a state-of-the-art deep learning technique. NBR(Normalized Burned Ratio), BAI(Burn Area Index), and FBI(Fire Burn Index), which are mainly used fire damage indices, were applied to seven forest fires cases together with the satellite images from Kompsat-3A, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 5. The existing spectral methods have limitation of threshold adjustment for each region and for each season. To mitigate this problem, we used the FCN(Fully Convolutional Network)-based U-Net model, which produced more effective detectability of forest fire damages. For future work, the result of spectral methods and several deep learning techniques can be compared quantitatively to prove the performance of U-Net model objectively."

Due to the recent expansion of houses with photovoltaic system and the nZEH mandatory by 2025, the rapid increase of distributed generation is expected. Which means, we must prepare for an electricity-power accident and stable electricity supply. Also electricity charges have to be reduce and the grid-connected should be operated efficiently. The introduction of ESS is suggested as a solution, so the analysis of the load matching and grid interaction is required to optimize ESS design. This study analyzed the load matching and grid interaction by expected consumption behavior using actual data measured in one-minute intervals.

Computed tomography super-resolution using deep convolutional neural network,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The objective of this study is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for computed tomography (CT) image super-resolution. The network learns an end-to-end mapping between low (thick-slice thickness) and high (thin-slice thickness) resolution images using the modified U-Net. To verify the proposed method, we train and test the CNN using axially averaged data of existing thin-slice CT images as input and their middle slice as the label. Fifty-two CT studies are used as the CNN training set, and 13 CT studies are used as the test set. We perform five-fold cross-validation to confirm the performance consistency. Because all input and output images are used in two-dimensional slice format, the total number of slices for training the CNN is 7670. We assess the performance of the proposed method with respect to the resolution and contrast, as well as the noise properties. The CNN generates output images that are virtually equivalent to the ground truth. The most remarkable image-recovery improvement by the CNN is deblurring of boundaries of bone structures and air cavities. The CNN output yields an approximately 10% higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and lower normalized root mean square error than the input (thicker slices). The CNN output noise level is lower than the ground truth and equivalent to the iterative image reconstruction result. The proposed deep learning method is useful for both super-resolution and de-noising.</P>"

Machine-learning-based automatic identification of fetal abdominal circumference from ultrasound images,2018,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P> <I>Objective</I>: Obstetricians mainly use ultrasound imaging for fetal biometric measurements. However, such measurements are cumbersome. Hence, there is urgent need for automatic biometric estimation. Automated analysis of ultrasound images is complicated owing to the patient-specific, operator-dependent, and machine-specific characteristics of such images. <I>Approach</I>: This paper proposes a method for the automatic fetal biometry estimation from 2D ultrasound data through several processes consisting of a specially designed convolutional neural network (CNN) and U-Net for each process. These machine learning techniques take clinicians’ decisions, anatomical structures, and the characteristics of ultrasound images into account. The proposed method is divided into three steps: initial abdominal circumference (AC) estimation, AC measurement, and plane acceptance checking. <I>Main results</I>: A CNN is used to classify ultrasound images (stomach bubble, amniotic fluid, and umbilical vein), and a Hough transform is used to obtain an initial estimate of the AC. These data are applied to other CNNs to estimate the spine position and bone regions. Then, the obtained information is used to determine the final AC. After determining the AC, a U-Net and a classification CNN are used to check whether the image is suitable for AC measurement.

Is Currency Appreciation or Depreciation Expansionary in Thailand?,2018,"['IS-MP-AS Model', 'Exchange Rates', 'Government Deficits', 'World Interest Rates', 'Stock Prices', 'Oil Prices']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Many developing countries have attempted to depreciate their currencies in order to make their products cheaper, stimulate exports, shift aggregate demand to the right, and increase aggregate output. However, currency depreciation tends to increase import prices, raise domestic inflation, reduce capital inflows, and shift aggregate supply to the left. The net impact is unclear. The paper incorporates the monetary policy function in the model, which is determined by the inflation gap, the output gap, the real effective exchange rate, and the world real interest rate. Applying an extended IS-MP-AS model (Romer, 2000), the paper finds that real depreciation raised real GDP during 1997.Q1-2005.Q3 whereas real appreciation increased real GDP during 2005.Q4-2017.Q2. In addition, a higher government debt-to-GDP ratio, a lower U.S. real federal funds rate, a higher real stock price, a lower real oil price or a lower expected inflation rate would help increase real GDP. Hence, real depreciation or real appreciation may increase or reduce aggregate output, depending upon the level of economic development. Although expansionary fiscal policy is effective in stimulating the economy, caution needs to be exercised as there may be a debt threshold beyond which a further increase in the debt-to-GDO ratio would hurt economic growth."

Fourth, it is documented that (1) the firm characteristic variables including change in return on assets, change in net interest margin, change in debt-to-equity ratio, and change in the proportion of fixed assets for the business purpose relative to equity have a significant and negative impact on efficiency change, (2) the firm characteristic variables including change in the proportion of company loans relative to total loans and change in the proportion of personal loans relative to total loans have a significant and negative effect on technical change, and (3) the firm characteristic variables including change in debt-to-equity ratio, change in the proportion of fixed assets for the business purpose relative to equity, change in non-performing loan ratio, change in the proportion of company loans relative to total loans and change in the proportion of personal loans relative to total loans have a significant and negative impact on productivity change. Lastly, it is also demonstrated that change in loans to deposits ratio has a significant and positive effect on efficiency change, technical change and productivity change, respectively."
ROI-based Fully Automated Liver Registration in Multi-phase CT Images,2018,"['Computer Aided Diagnosis', 'Liver', 'Cancer', 'Registration', 'Segmentation', 'CNN', 'ROI', 'Multi-phase CT']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, we propose a registration method for fully automated liver tumor detection. Multiple phases CT is used for the detection of the liver tumor because multiple phase CT can give different characteristic features of lesions for each time phases. Registration accuracy is important when obtaining image features from multiple time phases. However, since each time phases have different image density characteristics, therefore registration of multi-phase CT is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a robust initial alignment method independent of changing image density features in each time phase, and deformable registration method with region of interests (ROI) as liver region extracted by U-Net. Our proposed method is evaluated on 15 patient image sets. This method is applied to the early arterial phase and the equilibrium phase to registries. Experimental results show that segmentation of early arterial phase is 83% and registration is 93% accuracy."

The proposed deep learning model configures the tumor lesion segmentation model and a classification model of malignant melanoma. First, U-Net was used to segment a skin lesion area in the dermoscopic image. We could implement algorithms to classify malignant melanoma and benign tumor using skin lesion image and results of expert’s labeling in ResNet. The U-Net model obtained a dice similarity coefficient of 83.45% compared with results of expert’s labeling. The classification accuracy of malignant melanoma obtained the 83.06%. As the result, it is expected that the proposed artificial intelligence algorithm will utilize as a computer-aided diagnosis algorithm and help to detect malignant melanoma at an early stage."

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GLOBAL BRANDS SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNICATION IN CHINA: EVIDENCE FROM WEIBO,2018,"['social media', 'global brand', 'consumer engagement', 'communication effectiveness']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Introduction Social media communication has become a popular way for firms to engage with customers. Research shows that firms/brands engagement with fans or customers on social media is effective to improve brand equity (Kim & Ko, 2012), drive sales (eMarketer, 2015), and enhance both transactional and relational customer behaviour (Kumar, Bezawada, Rishika, Janakiraman, & Kannan, 2016). Given the influences of social media communication, how brands effectively engage with fans or followers on social media is an important question for marketers. Most research on this topic is from the applied psychology and consumer behaviour literature, whose theories and content are dominantly tested in laboratory setting. Very few research (e.g., Lee, Hosanagar, & Nair, 2017) applied real behaviour data of field settings to study this issue. Additionally, existent research primarily focuses on social media like Facebook and Twitter in developed counties. To our knowledge, no research examines global brands social media communications in developing country, like China. Due to the policy constraints, people in mainland China have no access to foreign social media platforms. There is a local social media platform in China, named Weibo. Weibo is a NASDAQ-listed company and has nearly 100 million active users monthly. Many brands, both global and local ones, have created Weibo accounts and keep engaging with their fans. For example, there are 1,452 luxury brands and 3,707 beverage brands or firms on Weibo (Weibo Data Centre, 2017). This paper focuses on global brands’ communication practices on Weibo. The purpose of this paper is to analyse how brand posts that global brands put on their social media page are correlated with fan engagement. By using real data form Weibo, we answer the following questions: (1) what attributes of brand posts on Weibo do affect fan engagement with global brands? (2) how do these attributes affect fans engagement behaviour (i.e. liking, sharing, and commenting) differently? Conceptual Framework We decompose the attributes of global brand social media posts into five aspects, which are proposed to affect fans engagement. The first two aspects, interactivity and vividness, are derived from computer-mediated-communication research (Frotin & Dholakia, 2005; Hoffman & Novak, 1996). The next two, informative and emotional attributes, are developed from the literature of advertising (Hong, Muderrisoglu, & Zinkhan, 1987; Geuens, Pelsmacker, & Faseur, 2011). The last one is localization-related attributes, which is from global marketing communication literature (Kanso & Nelson, 2002) to capture the special characteristics of global brand posts on a local social media platform. We argue that all these five aspects of global brand posts affect fans engagement on brand page. Fans engagement is conceptualized as fans behavioural response to brand posts, which will influence attitude and behaviour of other fans. There are three kinds of fans responses on brands social media page, i.e., liking, sharing and commenting. We do control the time and date of post issued, the text length of post, whether having celebrity in post, whether related to a remarkable event, the number of followers of brand on Weibo, and product category. Interactivity Interactivity is defined as “the degree to which two or more communication parties can act on each other, on the communication medium, and on the messages and the degree to which such influences are synchronized” (Liu & Shrum 2002, p.54). Interactivity requires two-way interaction between not only customers and companies, but customers themselves (Hoffman & Novak, 1996). Brand posts on Weibo differ in the degree of interactivity. Some posts only have text, picture, or video to deliver messages of brands, which has no possibility to interact with fans. Some posts include a link that fans can click to get more information, which enhances the interactivity of communication. Other posts have questions, which stimulate interaction with fans and followers. There are posts inviting people to indicate their like or comment on social media, which are considered as high interactivity as well. Advertising research has found the positive correlation between interactivity of ads and consumers’ attitude (Coyle & Thorson, 2001). De Vries, Gensler and Leeflang (2012) found interactivity of brand post on brand fan pages partially positively related to brand popularity (measured by number of likes and comments). Empirical research (Lee et al., 2017) using Facebook data showed that having links negatively associated with customer engagement, and having questions increased comments but reduced likings. For the inconsistent findings in the literature, we re-examine this relationship by focusing on global brands on a not well-examined Chinese social media, Weibo. Vividness Vividness refers to the format richness of the message (Daft & Lengel, 1986; Fortin & Dholakia, 2005). As for brand posts, vividness is reflected by the number of sensory dimensions and senses presented (text, colours, pictures, and videos, etc.). The degree of vividness influences what and how multiple senses are stimulated (Coyle & Thorson, 2001). For example, a picture post will activate more senses than a text post because the former has colour that stimulates sight more vividly than the later. Vividness is related to but differs from interactivity. Interactivity focuses on the characteristic of two-way interaction of the communication, while vividness stands for the multiple senses stimulated by the communication. Some advertising research found that a vivid web advertisement results in higher attention and more clicks (Lohtia, Donthu, & Hershberger, 2003). As a result, we differentiate vividness of each post and predict that more vivid post associated with higher customer engagement. A vivid post attracts more likes, shares and comments. Localization-related attributes Localization-related attributes are symbols that posts have reflecting the characteristics of local culture and people. The debate of globalization (standardization) versus localization has lasted several decades. Even though a global standardized marketing strategy saves money and gains scale economy, the localization approach (Keegan, 1969) is supported by the reality that each market has unique tastes. In the international advertising literature, some scholars found that many multinational firms “plan globally and act locally” (Blackwell, Ajami, & Stephan, 1991). “Global-local dilemma” exists when global luxury brands internationalize into the Chinese market (Liu et al., 2016). The marketing communication research found that it is not advised for global brands to use the same appeals and symbols in advertising across different countries (Kanso & Nelson, 2002). In other words, the combination of global advertising theme and local communication expertise can result in enhanced effectiveness. We propose, on Weibo, people are more actively engaged to like, share, or comment global brand posts when Chinese elements, such as Chinse handwriting, Chinese festivals, and Chinese celebrity spokespeople, are present. Informative attributes Besides interactivity and vividness, which capture the format characteristics of global brand posts, content-related attributes are associated with customer engagement as well. Informative content is an important side of content attributes. One important function of brand posts is to deliver messages to customers. Research shows that on social networks people tend to have positive attitudes towards informative ads (Taylor, Lewin, & Strutton, 2011). Global brand posts with specific information should result in higher customer engagement than less informative posts. Additionally, global brand posts on social media may have different types of marketing information, such as product, price, promotion and placerelated ones respectively. The posts with varying degree of informative content may change customer engagement as well. Emotional attributes Emotional attributes are another side of the content characteristics of brand posts besides informative ones. Advertising research shows that using emotion appeal in ads is an effective way to gain people attention and generate actions (Holbrook & Batra, 1987). Emotional connections between customers and brands are considered more stable than cognitive association (Heath, Brandt, & Nairn, 2006). Some scholars find that emotional appeal on banner advertising result in positive effects on click-through rates in both B2B and B2C contexts (Lohtia et al., 2003). Empirical research (Lee et al., 2017) on Facebook shows that perceived emotion in brand posts strongly boost users’ likes and comments. Similarly, we propose that emotional attributes of global brand posts on Weibo are correlated with fans engagement. We conceptualize emotional attributes with three elements, emotional tone, emotional icon and emotional core. Emotional core reflects the type of emotions, such as humour, happiness, and love, etc. Emotional tone stands for the strength of emotion, i.e. the emotion is weak or strong. Emotional icon refers to whether the content of posts has emotional symbols, which can take form of icons or net slangs. Research Design Operationalization Dependent variables Customer engagement is operationalized as three variables, the number of likes, the number of shares, and the number of comments of each global brand post. Independent variables Vividness. Vividness is operationalized as four categories standing for different vividness degree, text only, (text and) static picture, (text, static and) animated picture, (text, picture and) video. Interactivity. Interactivity is operationalized as five 0-1 variables, having link, having question, having invitation/incentive to like, having invitation/incentive to share, having invitation/incentive to comment. Localization-related attributes. This part is operationalized as four 0-1 variables, having Chinese culture image, having Chinese culture colour, having Chinese festival, and having Chinese celebrity spokespeople (we include celebrity as a control variable). Informative attributes. This part is operationalized as seven 0-1 variables, whether a post having information of (1) brand name, (2) promotion/trial, (3) price, (4) segmentation, (5) product lunch time, (6) purchase distribution, and (7) public relation event. Emotional attributes. This part is operationalized as three variables, (1) emotional icon, a 0- 1 variable, having emotional symbols or not, (2) emotional core, a categorical variable, different type of emotions identified by surveyed respondents, and (3) emotion tone, a scalerating variable from 1 to 3, standing for none, weak and strong emotion. Control Variables. There are five control variables, (1) time of posts, including date and hour; (2) length of posts, i.e., the number of Chinese characters; (3) celebrity, whether there is a celebrity in a post; (4) event, whether a post is related to a remarkable event; (5) the number of fans of brand, and (6) product category (3 dummy variables to differentiate four categories). Data We chose 6 global brands across five product categories, specifically, beverage (Coca-cola and Starbucks), cosmetics (Olay and L’Or?al), and sports (Nike and Adidas). All these global brands created Weibo account before 2012 and have cumulated a large number of followers. We select the posts from Sept. 1, 2016 to Feb. 28, 2017, within 6 months. This time duration is long enough to get analytical data. This period covers main Chinese traditional festivals, such as Mid-Autumn Festival, National Day, and Chinse New Year, which results in more variances in localization-related variables. Data were collected through two stages. The first stage was to download raw data from Weibo’s brand pages with Internet worm program directly. Each brand has its page which contains all posts it issued and the number of people’s likes, shares, and comments for each post. The second stage is to code content and get the final dataset. Most of 0-1 variables, such as interactivity, localization-related attributes, and informative attributes were coded by two research assistants. Variables of vividness were also coded by them. Variables of emotional attributes were coded by a survey to ask 500 Weibo users. This survey-based coded method is well applied in published research (e.g., Kumar et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017). Model The three dependent variables, the numbers of likes (y1), shares (y2), and comments (y3), are count data with a Poisson distribution. As a result, the basic model is as following: ?ij = ? + ???(Σ3p=1 ?1p ?????pj + Σ5q=1 ?2q ?????qj + Σ4r=1 ?lr ?????rj + Σ7s=1 ?4s ????sj + Σ3p=1 ?5t ????tj + ?6 ????j + ?7 ????j + ?8 ???j + ?9 ????j + ?10 ?????j + ?11 #??????j + Σ4u=1 ?12u ??????uj) + ?ij           (1) Expected Results This research is among the first initiative to examine social media communication in China. We are still working on the data analysis so far. We intend to identify the influence of global posts on fans engagement, which are from not only the content of posts (informative and emotional attributes), but also the design of posts (vividness and interactivity), and especially the localization considerations. We expect to find that the content foci differ fans engagement. Posts of sales promotion should be more effective to enhance fans engagement than those of product demonstration. We can identify what form of posts stimulates fans participation more effectively. We will know whether a video post is more effective than a picture post. Most interestingly, we will know how the posts combined with Chinese cultural elements on social media are responded. For example, we could compare the difference between posts having foreign and local celebrity people. We will know how different customer engagement behaviour influence by the same characteristic of posts. We can identify the most influential factors to each of three customer responses (liking, sharing, and commenting). Comparing with the research using data from Facebook or other social media outlets, we can obtain implications guiding global brands to implement social media strategy across countries."
