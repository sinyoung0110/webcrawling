다양한 크기의 식별자를 적용한 Cycle GAN을 이용한 다목적실용위성 5호 SAR 영상 색상 구현 방법,2018,"['SAR', 'KOMPSAT-5', 'Colorization', 'Deep Learning', 'Satellite Image Processing']","다목적실용위성 5호는 국내 최초로 영상레이더(SAR)가 탑재된 지구관측위성이다. SAR 영상은 위성에 부착된 안테나로부터 방사된 마이크로파가 물체로부터 반사된 신호를 수신하여 생성된다. SAR는 대기 중의입자의 크기에 비해 파장이 긴 마이크로파를 사용하기 때문에 구름이나 안개 등을 투과할 수 있으며, 주야간 구분 없이 고해상도의 영상을 얻을 수 있다. 하지만, SAR 영상에는 색상 정보가 부재하는 제한점이 존재한다. 이러한 SAR 영상의 제한점을 극복하기 위해, 도메인 변환을 위해 개발된 딥러닝 모델인 Cycle GAN을 활용하여 SAR 영상에 색상을 대입하는 연구를 수행하였다. Cycle GAN은 unpaired 데이터셋 기반의 무감독 학습으로 인해 학습이 불안정하다. 따라서 Cycle GAN의 학습 불안정성을 해소하고, 색상 구현의 성능을 향상하기 위해 다중 크기 식별자를 적용한 MS Cycle GAN을 제안하였다. MS Cycle GAN과 Cycle GAN의 색상 구현 성능을 비교하기 위하여 두 모델이 Florida 데이터셋을 학습하여 생성한 영상을 정성적 및 정량적으로 비교하였다. 다양한 크기의 식별자가 도입된 MS Cycle GAN은 기존의 Cycle GAN과 비교하여 학습 결과에서 생성자 및 식별자 손실이 대폭 감소되었고, 나뭇잎, 강, 토지 등의 영역 특성에 부합하는 색상이 구현되는 것을 확인하였다.","Kompsat-5 is the first Earth Observation Satellite which is equipped with an SAR in Korea. SAR images are generated by receiving signals reflected from an object by microwaves emitted from a SAR antenna. Because the wavelengths of microwaves are longer than the size of particles in the atmosphere, it can penetrate clouds and fog, and high-resolution images can be obtained without distinction between day and night. However, there is no color information in SAR images. To overcome these limitations of SAR images, colorization of SAR images using Cycle GAN, a deep learning model developed for domain translation, was conducted. Training of Cycle GAN is unstable due to the unsupervised learning based on unpaired dataset. Therefore, we proposed MS Cycle GAN applying multi-scale discriminator to solve the training instability of Cycle GAN and to improve the performance of colorization in this paper. To compare colorization performance of MS Cycle GAN and Cycle GAN, generated images by both models were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. Training Cycle GAN with multi-scale discriminator shows the losses of generators and discriminators are significantly reduced compared to the conventional Cycle GAN, and we identified that generated images by MS Cycle GAN are well-matched with the characteristics of regions such as leaves, rivers, and land."
PG-GAN을 이용한 패션이미지 데이터 자동 생성,2018,[],,"Techniques for generating new sample data from higher dimensional data such as images have been utilized variously for speech synthesis, image conversion and image restoration. This paper adopts Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Networks(PG-GANs) as an implementation model to generate high-resolution images and to enhance variation of the generated images, and applied it to fashion image data. PG-GANs allows the generator and discriminator to progressively learn at the same time, continuously adding new layers from low-resolution images to result high-resolution images. We also proposed a Mini-batch Discrimination method to increase the diversity of generated data, and proposed a Sliced Wasserstein Distance(SWD) evaluation method instead of the existing MS-SSIM to evaluate the GAN model."

A new model approach to predict the unloading rock slope displacement behavior based on monitoring data,2018,"['unloading rock slope', 'displacement prediction', 'fuzzy information granulation', 'genetic algorithm', 'back propagation neural network']",,"To improve the prediction accuracy of the strong-unloading rock slope performance and obtain the range of variation in the slope displacement, a new displacement time-series prediction model is proposed, called the fuzzy information granulation (FIG)-genetic algorithm (GA)-back propagation neural network (BPNN) model. Initially, a displacement time series is selected as the training samples of the prediction model on the basis of an analysis of the causes of the change in the slope behavior. Then, FIG is executed to partition the series and obtain the characteristic parameters of every partition. Furthermore, the later characteristic parameters are predicted by inputting the earlier characteristic parameters into the GA-BPNN model, where a GA is used to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of the BPNN; in the process, the numbers of input layer nodes, hidden layer nodes, and output layer nodes are determined by a trial method. Finally, the prediction model is evaluated by comparing the measured and predicted values. The model is applied to predict the displacement time series of a strong-unloading rock slope in a hydropower station. The engineering case shows that the FIG-GA-BPNN model can obtain more accurate predicted results and has high engineering application value."

Dislocation-Related Electron Transport in Au Schottky Junctions on AlGaN/GaN,2018,"['AlGaN/GaN', 'Tunneling current', 'Dislocation density']",,"We investigated the electrical properties of Au/AlGaN/GaN Schottky junctions as a function of temperature by analyzingthe current–voltage ( I – V ) measurements. The barrier height increased with increasing temperature, but the idealityfactor decreased. Increases in temperature are associated with barrier inhomogeneity. The modifi ed Richardson plots forAl 0.25 Ga 0.75 N yielded a higher Richardson constant, 77.3 A cm −2 K −2 , than theoretically predicted (30.0 A cm −2 K −2 ). Thisindicates that the thermionic emission (TE) model with barrier inhomogeneity is not suitable for explaining the transportcharacteristics of the junction. We fi tted the experimental I – V data to predictions based on various transport mechanisms,such as TE, generation-recombination, and tunneling currents. The dominant transport mechanism at all temperatures wasfound to be caused by the tunneling current. The dislocation model of the tunneling current yielded a dislocation density of2.96 × 10 6 cm −2 ."
Effect of herbal extracts on bone regeneration in a rat calvaria defect model and screening system,2018,"['Bone regeneration', 'Herb extract', 'Danshen', 'Ge Gan', 'Rat calvaria defect']",,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of herbal extracts on bone regeneration. Two known samples were screened.Materials and Methods: We previously established a rat calvaria defect model using a combination of collagen scaffold and herbal extracts. An 8 mm diameter trephine bur with a low-speed dental hand piece was used to create a circular calvaria defect. The experimental group was divided into 4 classifications: control, collagen matrix, Danshen with collagen, and Ge Gan with collagen. Animals in each group were sacrificed at 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks after surgery, and bone regeneration ability was evaluated by histological examination.Results: Results revealed that both Danshen and Ge Gan extracts increased bone formation activity when used with collagen matrix. All groups showed almost the same histological findings until 6 weeks. However, after 6 weeks, bone formation activity proceeded differently in each group. In the experimental groups, new bone formation activity was found continuously up to 10 weeks. In the Danshen and Ge Gan groups, grafted materials were still present until 10 weeks after treatment, as evidenced by foreign body reactions showing multinucleated giant cells in chronic inflammatory vascular connective tissue.Conclusion: Histological analyses showed that Danshen and Ge Gan extractions increased bone formation activity when used in conjunction with collagen matrix."

In this work, we demonstrate the morphological and opticalevolution of Ag nanostructures on GaN (0001) by the systematic control of deposition amount at two distinctive annealingtemperatures. Based on the Volmer–Weber and coalescence growth models, the nanostructure growth commenced by thethermal solid-state-dewetting evolve in terms of size, density and configuration. At 450 °C, the round-dome shaped Agnanoparticles (regime I), irregular Ag nano-mounds (regime II) and void-layer structures (regime III) are observed alongwith the gradually increased deposition amount. As a sharp distinction, the solid state dewetting process occur more radicallyat 700 °C and also, the Ag sublimation and the effect on the nanostructure formation are observed in a clear regime shiftscaled by the deposition amount. Meanwhile, a strong dependency of reflectance spectra evolution on the Ag nanostructuremorphology is witnessed for both sets. In particular, Ag dipolar resonance peaks are significantly red-shifted from VIS toNIR regions along with the nanostructure evolution. The reflectance, PL and Raman intensity variation are also observedand discussed based on the evolution of Ag nanostructures."

The process of reconstructing clear-weather image from a hazy image is called dehazing. The main challenge of image dehazing is to estimate the transmission map or depth map for an input hazy image. In this paper, we propose a single image dehazing method by utilizing the Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) for accurate depth map estimation. The proposed GAN model is trained to learn a nonlinear mapping between the input hazy image and corresponding depth map. With the trained model, first the depth map of the input hazy image is estimated and used to compute the transmission map. Then a guided filter is utilized to preserve the important edge information of the hazy image, thus obtaining a refined transmission map. Finally, the haze-free image is recovered via atmospheric scattering model. Although the proposed GAN model is trained on synthetic indoor images, it can be applied to real hazy images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior dehazing results against the state-of-the-art algorithms on both the real hazy images and the synthetic hazy images, in terms of quantitative performance and visual performance."

What is the problematic of this movie is to create a model of ideological movies in a new genre by producing a musical-comedy new year’s film after changing Jia Ping-wa’s novel with the representative bottom narrative grabbing many people’s attention to the diaosi narrative mixed with the shan-zhai elements and wulitou elements that used to be regarded to be at the antipode of mainstream culture. Here, the researcher pays attention to the point that the film has extended the area of mainstream culture by burrowing into the gap of mainstream culture with the use of anti-mainstream elements such as shan-zhai and wulitou elements. When the Ah-Q mental victory method that has been criticized as a model of unawakened farmers by intellectuals for a long time evolves into the Gao-xing mental victory method, does the modern China ask migrant workers to solve their own dissatisfactions through the ultra-positive mind by acknowledging the Gao-xing mental victory method?

In this model, the shaft diameter, chamfering degree and the shaft extension of the power end are selected as optimization variables, the limit values of the variables and maximal normal deformation of the spindle are considered as the constraint conditions, and the minimization of the equivalent alternating stress on the dangerous shaft section is taken as the optimization objective so as to improve the shaft fatigue reliability. The optimization results of a case show that the equivalent alternating stress on the dangerous spindle section reduces by 26.2 %, and the maximal normal deformation decreases by 25.2 % compared with the original design. In addition, the infinite life reliability and fatigue safety factors both meet the design requirements."
Correlation Between the Microstructural Defects and Residual Stress in a Single Crystal Nickel-Based Superalloy During Different Creep Stages,2018,"['Superalloy', 'Creep', 'Microstructure', 'Residual stress', 'Neutron diff raction', 'Tension']",,"The present work attempts to reveal the correlation between the microstructural defects and residual stress in the singlecrystal nickel-based superalloy, both of which play the signifi cant role on properties and performance. Neutron diff ractionwas employed to investigate the microstructural defects and residual stresses in a single crystal (SC) nickel-based superalloy,which was subjected to creeping under 220 MPa and 1000 °C for different times. The measured superlattice andfundamental lattice refl ections confi rm that the mismatch and tetragonal distortions with c / a > 1 exist in the SC superalloy.At the initially unstrained state, there exists the angular distortion between γ and γ’ phases with small triaxial compressivestresses, ensuring the structural stability of the superalloy. After creeping, the tetragonal distortion for the γ phase is largerthan that for the γ’ phase. With increasing the creeping time, the mismatch between γ and γ’ phases increases to the maximum,then decreases gradually and fi nally remains unchanged. The macroscopic residual stress shows a similar behaviorwith the mismatch, indicating the correlation between them. Based on the model of shear and dislocations, the evolution ofmicrostructural defects and residual stress are reasonably explained. The effect of shear is dominant at the primary creepstage, which greatly enlarges the mismatch and the residual stress. The dislocations weaken the effect of shear for the furthercreep stage, resulting in the decrease of the mismatch and relaxation of the residual stress. Those fi ndings add some helpfulunderstanding into the microstructure-performance relationship in the SC nickel-based superalloy, which might provide theinsight to materials design and applications."
Generative Adversarial Network를 이용한 손실된 깊이 영상 복원,2018,"['Deep learning', 'generative adversarial network', 'depth image', 'depth camera', 'restoration']",,This paper proposes a method of restoring corrupted depth image captured by depth camera through unsupervised learning using generative adversarial network (GAN). The proposed method generates restored face depth images using 3D morphable model convolutional neural network (3DMM CNN) with large-scale CelebFaces Attribute (CelebA) and FaceWarehouse dataset for training deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). The generator and discriminator equip with Wasserstein distance for loss function by utilizing minimax game. Then the DCGAN restore the loss of captured facial depth images by performing another learning procedure using trained generator and new loss function.
「부도지(符都誌)」의 콘텐츠에 관한 소고(小考) - “한”과의 중첩,2018,"['「부도지」', '박제상', '한국선도', '한사상', '천부', '률려', '복본', '『BuDoJi』', 'Park Jae-Sang', 'Korean Sundo', 'Hanism', '符都誌', '朴堤上', '天符', '律呂', '複本']",,"「Budoji(符都誌)」, known as a work by Park Jae-sang(the Shilla Dynasty) is the Genesis which is hard to be found in Korean history containing records of the origin and the development process of ancient Korea. There remains rewritten text only by Park Geum (a descendent of Park Jae-sang) in modern times, so it has a bibliographical limit as historical records which is hard to be overcome. Though「Budoji(符都誌)」can be a text of greater value to infer the indigenous ideas and cultures from ancient Korea since it contains stories which have great potential value of use.「Budoji(符都誌)」 is narrated on the ideological basis of Korean Sundo. The stories from 「Budoji(符都誌)」 permeate significant ideologies of Korean Sundo such as the pursuit of Hong Ik In Gan(弘益人間) Jae-Sae-Ee-Hwa(在世理化), the perspective on practice in the idea of Shin-In-Hap-Il(神人合一) and the tradition of Gyum Soeng(兼聖). The theme from 「Budoji(符都誌)」 is considerably related with the paradigm of Hanism, which is the native-Korean traditional ideology. In other words, the common premises shared in Hanism-a view on history, a view on human being, and the value orientation have common grounds with what the contents of 「Budoji(符都誌)」pursue. The keywords from 「Budoji(符都誌)」 such as Seon-Chun(‘先天’), Yool Ryoe(‘律呂’), Chun Bu(‘天符’) and Bok-Bon(‘複本’) symbolize “Han”. And the stories from 「Budoji(符都誌)」 realize the concrete implementation model of Hanism."
