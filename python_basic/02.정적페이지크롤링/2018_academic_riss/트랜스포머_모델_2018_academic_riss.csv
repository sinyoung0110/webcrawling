Vibration Analysis of Transformer DC bias Caused by HVDC based on EMD Reconstruction,2018,"['Transformer vibration', 'HVDC transmission', 'Signal reconstruction', 'EMD']",,"This paper proposes a new approach utilizing empirical mode decomposition (EMD) reconstruction to process vibration signals of a transformer under DC bias caused by high voltage direction transmission (HVDC), which is the potential cause of additional vibration and noise from transformer. Firstly, the Calculation Method is presented and a 3D model of transformer is simulated to analyze transformer deformation characteristic and the result indicate the main vibration is produced along axial direction of three core limbs. Vibration test system has been built and test points on the core and shell of transformer have been measured. Then, the signal reconstruction method for transformer vibration based on EMD is proposed. Through the EMD decomposition, the corrupted noise can be selectively reconstructed by the certain frequency IMFs and better vibration signals of transformer have been obtained. After EMD reconstruction, the vibrations are compared between transformer in normal work and with DC bias. When DC bias occurs, odd harmonics, vibration of core and shell, behave as a nonlinear increase and the even harmonics keep unchanged with DC current. Experiment results are provided to collaborate our theoretical analysis and to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed EMD method."

Efficiency Optimization with a Novel Magnetic-Circuit Model for Inductive Power Transfer in EVs,2018,"['Core losses', 'Efficiency', 'Inductive power transfer', 'Loosely coupled transformer', 'Magnetic-circuit model']",,"The technology of inductive power transfer has been proved to be a promising solution in many applications especially in electric vehicle (EV) charging systems, due to its features of safety and convenience. However, loosely coupled transformers lead to the system efficiency not coming up to the expectation at the present time. Therefore, at first, the magnetic core losses are calculated with a novel magnetic-circuit model instead of the commonly used finite-element-method (FEM) simulations. The parameters in the model can be obtained with a one-time FEM simulation, which makes the calculation process expeditious. When compared with traditional methods, the model proposed in the paper is much less time-consuming and relatively accurate. These merits have been verified by experimental results. Furthermore, with the proposed loss calculation model, the system is optimized by parameter sweeping, such as the operating frequency and winding turns. Specifically, rather than a predesigned switching frequency, a more efficiency-optimized frequency for the series-parallel (SP) compensation topology is detected and a detailed investigation has been presented accordingly. The optimized system is capable of an efficiency that is greater than 93% at a coil separation distance of 200mm and coil dimensions of $600mm{\times}400mm$."

Step-Up Asymmetrical Nine Phase Delta-Connected Transformer for HVDC Transmission,2018,"['18-pulse ac-dc converters', 'Asymmetrical autotransformer', 'LCC-HVDC', 'Thyristor', 'THD current']",,"In order to provide a source for nine phases suitable for 18-pulse ac to dc power, this paper proposes a new structure for a step-up asymmetrical delta-connected transformer for converting three-phase ac power to nine-phase ac power.

Modified Differential Protection for Transformers in Wind Farms,2018,"['Distributed generation', 'Differential relay', 'Fault level', 'Transformer', 'Wind farm']",,The liberalization of electricity market and environmental concerns are the major driving forces for the development of Distributed Generation (DG). The mode of grid-connected wind power generation is becoming popular and has matured as a reliable DG technology. The voltage generated by the wind generator is stepped up to the higher voltage by the transformers before connecting to the grid. Operating algorithm of the differential relays for transformer protection used in the wind farms need to be modified to take care of the dynamic nature of fault current caused by the intermittent nature of the wind power. An algorithm for the differential relay is proposed in which dual slope characteristics are adjusted with varying fault level situation according to the wind generator in service as well as with the wind speed. A case study conducted for a typical wind farm shows that the proposed method avoids mal-operation of the differential relay in varying wind power conditions.

Consequently, the IMEP performance analyzed by these experiments and simulations was notable in that it was demonstrated that the plasma energies could be promoted significantly and quickly to create a thermochemical reaction in the order of spark < arc < jet model in a chamber, and the plasma energies were shown to be predictable in that FCR (fuel consumption rate) could demonstrably be improved in a chamber.</P>"

The reliability of the VDMS was verified by comparison with the existing monitoring sensor, GPS, Accelerometer and LDS. It showed the ability to accurately measure the dynamic displacement by tracking a motion of free vibration of target. And using the PSD function of measured data, the results in the frequency domain were also analyzed. We judged that VDMS is able to identify the higher system mode and has sufficient reliability. Based on the reliability verification, we conducted tests for long-distance applicability for actual application of VDMS. The distance from the stationary target model structure was increased by 50m interval, and the maximum distance was set to 400m. From the distance of 150m, the image obtained by the commercial camcorder has an error in the analysis, so the measured displacement comparison was performed between the LDS and the refractor telescope measurement results. In the measurement results of the displacement area of V DMS, the data validity was deteriorated due to the data shift by the external force and the quality degradation of the enlarged image. However, even under the condition that the effectiveness of the displacementmeasurement data of VDMS is low, the first mode characteristic included in the free vibration of the object is clearly measured. If the influence from the external environment is controlled and stable data is collected, It is judged that reliability of long-distance VDMS can be secured."

Therefore, the housing should have been designed considering not only strengthen, but also lighten. Furthermore, efficiency is also one of important characteristics in power transfer to improve the whole system efficiency. Taking account of aforementioned points, the stainless steel (SUS) and aluminum (Al), which are commonly used as housing materials, were under reviewed as CPS housing.

The classical P- type metal-oxide semiconductor varactor is used as a fine-tuning element with the advantage being that a linear frequency tuning range (FTR) is obtained. In each obtained band, the varactor provides a frequency range of approximately 2.9 GHz. Simulation shows that by on/off switches, obtain three frequency bands (55 GHz to 57.943 GHz, 57.172 GHz to 60.357 GHz, and 59.329 GHz to 62.4 GHz) to cover the whole V-band (60 GHz) frequency.
