Accuracy Comparison of GPT and SBAS Troposphere Models for GNSS Data Processing,2018,"['GPS', 'GNSS', 'GPT', 'SBAS', 'tropospheric delay']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal gets delayed as it goes through the troposphere before reaching the GNSS antenna. Various tropospheric models are being used to correct the tropospheric delay. In this study, we compared effectiveness of two popular troposphere correction models: Global Pressure and Temperature (GPT) and Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS). One-year data from a particular site was chosen as the test case. Tropospheric delays were computed using the GPT and SBAS models and compared with the International GNSS Service tropospheric product. The bias of SBAS model computations was 3.4 cm, which is four times lower than that of the GPT model. The cause of higher biases observed in the GPT model is the fact that one cannot get wet delays from the model. If SBAS-based wet delays are added to the hydrostatic delays computed using the GPT model, then the accuracy is similar to that of the full SBAS model. From this study, one can conclude that it is better to use the SBAS model than to use the GPT model in the standard code-pseudorange data processing."

Br. (SP) powder on the antioxidative defense system and oxidative stress in rats which were fed a high fat‧high cholesterol diet. Accordingly, the rats were divided into four experimental groups which were composed of a high fat‧high cholesterol diet group (HF), HF diet with 5% SP powder supplemented group (PA), a HF diet with 10% SP powder supplemented group (PB), and a normal group (N). Consequently, the hepatic catalase activity of the HF group was decreased compared to the normal group (N), but it is recorded that of the PA and PB groups were significantly increased. With this in mind, the PA and PB groups resulted in the case of significantly increased activities of hepatic GSH-px and SOD. The hepatic superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide contents of the PA and PB groups were significantly decreased, as compared to the HF group. The GOT and GPT activities of the PB group were also significantly decreased when thus compared to the HF group.Notably, the carbonyl values contents of the PA and PB groups were significantly reduced compared to the HF group. The hepatic TBARS values in the liver were significantly reduced as measured in the PA and PB groups. These results suggest that the SP powder may reduce the incidence of oxidative damage, by the activation of an antioxidative enzyme in rats fed with high fat‧high cholesterol diets."

This study investigated the effects of trichlorfon on hematological parameters, biochemical factors, and stress reaction in <I>Cyprinus carpio</I> L. The fish were exposed to acute concentrations of trichlorfon (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg L<SUP>−1</SUP>) at 25 °C and 15 °C for 1 and 2 weeks, after which several parameters were evaluated to assess the effects of the pesticide. Significant decreases were observed in red blood cell (RBC) Count, hemoglobin (Hb) level, hematocrit (Ht), and plasma protein levels after each exposure period. In contrast, notable increases in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), calcium, and glucose levels were observed in the trichlorfon-treated groups. Additionally, there were significant increases in the plasma levels of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) following the exposure to trichlorfon. Furthermore, the results showed a relationship between toxic stress and increment in <I>HSP70</I> and cytochrome P450 1A (<I>CYP1A</I>) expression over time. Ht, MCV, MCH, and the value of other biochemical parameters were quite lower at 15 °C than their corresponding values were at 25 °C, which indicated the decreased physical activity at 15 °C. The results of the present work indicate that acute exposure to trichlorfon and thermal stimulus could damage erythropoietic tissue. Additionally, hepatocytes function and physiological mechanisms could be impaired.

Thresholds of Genotoxic and Non-Genotoxic Carcinogens,2018,"['Genotoxic carcinogens', 'Non-genotoxic carcinogens', 'Threshold', 'Threshold of toxicological concern', 'TTC']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Exposure to chemical agents is an inevitable consequence of modern society; some of these agents are hazardous to human health. The effects of chemical carcinogens are of great concern in many countries, and international organizations, such as the World Health Organization, have established guidelines for the regulation of these chemicals. Carcinogens are currently categorized into two classes, genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens, which are subject to different regulatory policies. Genotoxic carcinogens are chemicals that exert carcinogenicity via the induction of mutations. Owing to their DNA interaction properties, there is thought to be no safe exposure threshold or dose. Genotoxic carcinogens are regulated under the assumption that they pose a cancer risk for humans, even at very low doses. In contrast, non-genotoxic carcinogens, which induce cancer through mechanisms other than mutations, such as hormonal effects, cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, or epigenetic changes, are thought to have a safe exposure threshold or dose; thus, their use in society is permitted unless the exposure or intake level would exceed the threshold. Genotoxicity assays are an important method to distinguish the two classes of carcinogens. However, some carcinogens have negative results in in vitro bacterial mutation assays, but yield positive results in the in vivo transgenic rodent gene mutation assay. Non-DNA damage, such as spindle poison or topoisomerase inhibition, often leads to positive results in cytogenetic genotoxicity assays such as the chromosome aberration assay or the micronucleus assay. Therefore, mechanistic considerations of tumor induction, based on the results of the genotoxicity assays, are necessary to distinguish genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens. In this review, the concept of threshold of toxicological concern is introduced and the potential risk from multiple exposures to low doses of genotoxic carcinogens is also discussed."

A formula diet based on pork meat oligopeptide and soybean oligopeptide was designed for experimental hepatitic rats. A hepatotoxic agent, D-galactosamine, was injected to the rats to induce hepatotoxicity for 6 days. During the experimental period, the rats were provided with a 12% casein diet (control) or the formula diet which had a low concentration of aromatic amino acids and a high concentration of branched chain amino acids. As a result, the hepatitic rats fed formula diet had lower plasma GOT and GPT levels than the control group, especially the plasma fisher ratio was significantly lower. The blood immunity test showed that plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentration was significantly higher in the rats fed the formula diet than those of the control. All of these results show that the formula diet is better at preventing and recovering from liver damage in animals than the casein diet. In conclusion, pork meat oligopeptides and soybean oligopeptides are considered to be excellent nitrogen sources for formula diets for patients suffering from hepatitis."

Relationship Between Serum Tumor-related Markers and Dietary Intakes in Korean Healthy Adults,2018,"['Tumors', 'Biomarkers', 'Carcinoembryonic antigen', 'Alpha-fetoproteins', 'Prostate-specific antigen', 'CA-125 antigen', 'Diet']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum tumor markers and dietary intakes in healthy adults to address a nutrition guide for cancer prevention. We analyzed tumor-related markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) in serum and daily food and nutrient intakes using a 24-hour recall method in 23 healthy men and 32 healthy women. The average age was 50.7 years for men and 48.9 years for women. There were no significant differences in biochemical tumor markers and food intake between the men and women except energy intake. A significantly positive correlation was found between serum AFP, a biochemical marker of liver cancer, and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and/or glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT) in both men and women. CEA had a significant and negative correlation with energy intake for men and food intake in women. PSA, a biomarker of prostate cancer, was significantly and positively correlated with the intake of animal iron and cholesterol in men. CA125, a biomarker of gynecologic cancers, was significantly and positively correlated with meat intake in women. As this study revealed the significant relationship between biochemical tumor markers and dietary factors, further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this relationship."
고콜레스테롤 식이의 급여에 의해 고지혈증이 유도된 흰쥐의 신령버섯 자실체의 항고지혈증 효과,2018,"['Agaricus brasiliensis', 'Cholesterol', 'Hypolipidemia', 'Lipid profile', 'Liver histopathology']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with fruiting body of Agaricus brasiliensis (AB) mushroom on the lipid profiles of serum and histological patterns of liver of high cholesterol-fed rats. Five-week-old, female Sprague-Dawley albino rats were divided into three groups of 8 rats each, including a normal control-diet (NC) group, a highcholesterol diet (HC) group, and a group fed high-cholesterol diet supplemented with 5 % powder of Agaricus brasiliensis fruiting bodies (HC+AB). Total serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyceride (TG) concentrations in the HC+AB group were significantly reduced when compared with those in the HC group. Body weight in the HC+AB group was significantly lower than that in the HC group, whereas no adverse effects were observed on the levels of plasma albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, glucose, and total protein. In the HC+AB group, liver enzyme activities related to liver function, such as GOT and GPT, presented values lower than those in the HC group and were very similar to the ones in the NC group. Excretion of total lipid and cholesterol in feces in the HC+AB group was significantly higher than that in the NC and HC groups, indicating that mushroom feeding inhibits the absorption of lipid cholesterol in the intestine. Liver histopathological analyses revealed that rats fed with HC diet developed fat liver disease, whereas only small amounts of fat were deposited in the livers of the HC+AB group. In conclusion, the results suggest that fruiting body powder of A. brasiliensis provides health benefits to high-cholesterol-fed rats by lowering body weight and the risk of atherogenic lipid profile."

Pop-up satellite archival tag (PSAT) 체외부착에 따른 해산어의 생리학적 반응,2018,"['PSAT', 'red seabream', 'Korean rockfish', 'physiological responses']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recently, the pop-up satellite archival tag (PSAT) is being used in studies as a method of using satellites for monitoring organisms. Because PSATs are attached directly on the organism being monitored, it is used mostly on larger species since the health of the organism is an important concern. For this reason, PSAT-based surveys are lacking in Korea with no studies on the physiological responses of organisms with PSAT attached. Accordingly, as a basic biomonitoring study using PSAT, the present study investigated the physiological changes in fish in response to the attachment of PSAT. The present study used red seabream (Pagrus major) and Korean rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii) as the experimental fish. The PSAT was attached to the muscle below the experimental fish’s dorsal fin using a mono filament (n = 3). To investigate the changes in physiological responses according to PSAT attachment, blood samples were collected from all experimental fish, including the control (n = 3), at 1, 7, 14 and 21 days after the attachment. Upon blood sample collection, whole blood was used to measure hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. After separating the plasma, the separated plasma was used to measure the GOT, GPT, glucose, total protein, and cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, the plasma cortisol, superoxide dismutase, and catalase levels were measured using the ELISA method. The results showed that attaching the tag did not have any impact on the immunity and stress response of the experimental fish. The findings in this study also demonstrated the possibility of using PSAT for studying relatively smaller species living in the coastal waters of Korea."
