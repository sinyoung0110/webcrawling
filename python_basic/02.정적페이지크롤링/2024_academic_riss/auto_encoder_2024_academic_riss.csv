Musical Genre Classification Based on Deep Residual Auto-Encoder and Support Vector Machine,2024,"['Deep Residual Auto-Encoder', 'MFCC', 'Music Artificial Intelligence', 'Musical Genre Classification']",,"Music brings pleasure and relaxation to people. Therefore, it is necessary to classify musical genres based on scenes. Identifying favorite musical genres from massive music data is a time-consuming and laborious task. Recent studies have suggested that machine learning algorithms are effective in distinguishing between various musical genres. However, meeting the actual requirements in terms of accuracy or timeliness is challenging. In this study, a hybrid machine learning model that combines a deep residual auto-encoder (DRAE) and support vector machine (SVM) for musical genre recognition was proposed. Eight manually extracted features from the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) were employed in the preprocessing stage as the hybrid music data source. During the training stage, DRAE was employed to extract feature maps, which were then used as input for the SVM classifier. The experimental results indicated that this method achieved a 91.54% F1-score and 91.58% top-1 accuracy, outperforming existing approaches. This novel approach leverages deep architecture and conventional machine learning algorithms and provides a new horizon for musical genre classification tasks."

This study addresses the challenge of detecting anomalous flight trajectories, which can be influenced by environmental factors. We propose a novel Long Short-Term Memory-Auto Encoder (LSTM-AE) model that processes both environmental and trajectory data but only reconstructs trajectory data in its output. This approach was validated by assessing the average reconstruction error for specific trajectories. Additionally, the model's ability to identify anomalies was confirmed by evaluating the Area under the ROC curve (AUC) for typical anomalous trajectories, such as go-around maneuvers. Our findings indicate that the proposed LSTM-AE model effectively learns trajectory patterns in relation to environmental variables and shows enhanced anomaly detection capabilities compared to traditional AE and LSTM-AE models. These results contribute to the development of advanced models that incorporate a wider range of environmental factors, enhancing safety in urban air travel."
Realizable Global Optimum of ELBO via Bijectiveness in Auto-encoder Networks,2024,"['Generative model', 'VAE', 'Bijection', 'ELBO', '생성 모델', '변분 오토 인코더', '전단사 함수', '로그 우도 하한']",,"Variational auto-encoders(VAEs) combines random latent re-sampling and sample-wise regularization that easily fail to be optimized suffering from under-regularization or posterior collapse.

New Golay decoding method using auto-encoder and OSD,2024,['Machine learningAuto-encoderOrdered statistics decodingGolay code'],,"In this study, we explore the potential of leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically auto-encoders (AE), for the decoding of linear block codes. Our findings suggest that this approach can outperform the conventional ordered statistics decoding (OSD) method, especially in a Rayleigh fading channel environment. We have rigorously trained the AE under both additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channel conditions to ensure robustness in its performance. The output of the AE is combined with the received vector in a suitable manner to perform OSD.

Development of a feedforward-based path tracking algorithm with  steering bias compensation for an auto-guided tractor,2024,"['Path tracking system', 'Hydrostatic steering system', 'Compensation algorithm', 'Steering bias', 'Auto-guided tractor']",,"As the commercialization of self-driving agricultural machinery advances, domestic farmers are increasingly purchasing auto-guidance steering kits for agricultural operations. However, due to the characteristics of the hydrostatic steering system in tractors, oil leakage can lead to steering bias during operation. While a wheel angle sensor can mitigate this issue, they incur additional costs. Moreover, using a wheel angle sensor to correct steering bias may introduce a delay, particularly when disturbances occur during agricultural tasks. This study developed a compensation algorithm for an auto-guidance system that operates without a wheel angle sensor, ensuring both accuracy and stability in path tracking.The proposed compensation algorithm predicts steering bias based on motor encoder from the tractor’s electric power steering system, eliminating the need for a steering angle sensor. It employed a feedforward method to compensate for steering bias in real time, enabling rapid response to disturbances and addressing the inherent limitation of the hydrostatic steering system. To control path tracking, the stanley algorithm was fused with a PID controller. Field experiments were conducted with various tractor models equipped with an automatic steering system. The results demonstrated that the path tracking system, incorporating the proposed compensation algorithm, closely followed straight reference paths. The system achieved a root mean square error of lateral deviation as low as 2 cm and heading errors of less than 1.1 degrees, confirming its effectiveness and precision."

믹스업 알고리즘과 오토 인코더를 이용한 전동기 기어 고장 진단 실용화 기법 연구,2024,"['Deep Learning', 'Motor fault diagnosis', 'Auto-encoder', 'Anomaly detection', 'IoT', 'Moving average', 'Mix-up']",,"In this paper, a practical data acquisition method and fault diagnosis method for applying motor fault diagnosis in the field are studied. Since it is very difficult to acquire fault data in the field, unsupervised learning methods that can be trained using only normal state data are mainly used. However, unsupervised learning methods are very vulnerable to disturbances and are difficult to express the fault level. Disturbances in the field include electrical noise, which can cause data acquisition devices to fail due to low power quality in the field and affect the measured signal, and mechanical noise, such as external vibrations, which directly affect the operation of the electric motor. To minimize the impact of electrical noise, it is common to use hardware filters. Unlike previous studies that use theoretical cutoff frequency setting methods, this paper proposes a method to find the appropriate cutoff frequency using LRP(Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) analysis, one of the XAI(eXplainable A.I) techniques, for practical data acquisition.Fault diagnosis in the field requires robust unsupervised learning algorithms that can ignore the presence of mechanical noise in the signal, such as transient shocks. This is solved by post-processing the output of the auto-encoder with a moving average filter. To represent the fault level a data generation technique, the mix-up algorithm, is used. A method is proposed to threshold the auto-encoder multiple times with data generated by the mix-up algorithm. This proposed method shows the availability of motor fault diagnosis considering the on-site data."

With the growing availability of diverse trajectory data and advancements in deep learning methodologies, research has focused on detecting anomalies in vehicles, aircraft, and ships. While previous studies emphasized the morphological similarity of trajectories, recent work has shown promising results by leveraging deep learning models, such as Variational Autoencoders(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs), using features extracted from trajectories, including velocity and direction. Although there have been studies on anomaly detection in vehicle and ship trajectories, anomaly detection in pedestrian trajectories has been limited due to challenges in data collection. Existing analyses often rely on small-scale indoor trajectory data or short CCTV video extracts, which do not adequately represent patterns on roads and lack comprehensive spatiotemporal characteristics. This study proposes an anomaly detection architecture based on pedestrian trajectories collected every second over one week from 16 CCTV cameras. The architecture consists of data transformation module, reconstruction module, and anomaly detection module, with the reconstruction module employing a Variational Autoencoder(VAE). To capture the temporal characteristics of the trajectories, the encoder and decoder are implemented using Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) networks.

This means that the 3D model remains unchanged and that a tunable texture pattern is achieved by injecting modifications of the G-code just before the printing process. Furthermore, Texture-Slicer  allows users to control the level of roughness with the texture parameters (wavelength, amplitude, and vertical spacing), supporting the creation of numerous custom textures for the same underlying geometry.Results              Technical evaluation of paradigms was conducted with 30 test samples.

Photovoltaic DC arc fault detection method based on deep residual shrinkage network,2024,"['Photovoltaic system', 'Arc detection', 'Deep residual shrinkage network', 'Photovoltaic system fault detection']",,"Distributed photovoltaic systems have encountered unprecedented opportunities for development given their environmentally friendly nature and flexible power generation characteristics. However, numerous connecting lines and taps within the distributed photovoltaic system can be subject to insulation issues, which will consequently cause direct current (DC) arc faults and severe electrical fire hazards. Moreover, the power semiconductor devices in the photovoltaic inverter can introduce common-mode noises to the DC current, resulting in unwanted tripping of the DC arc fault detector. The study proposes an arc fault detection method utilizing a deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN) to address this issue, thereby precisely detecting DC arc faults. A test platform for series arc faults in photovoltaic systems is built. The arc current data are collected for characteristic analysis in time and frequency domains to determine which bandwidth is preferred for the algorithm. The model’s depth is increased by introducing residual connections, enhancing its feature extraction, and improving noise reduction capabilities. The residual shrinkage network has been enhanced to prevent a computation increase from increased network depth. Introducing a convolutional auto-encoder for data dimension reduction has decreased neural network parameters, thereby improving training speed. A prototype for detecting photovoltaic DC arc faults was constructed using Raspberry Pi 4B, validating the practical application value of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the prototype for detecting photovoltaic DC arc faults successfully fulfi lls the real-time detection standard of the conduction test."

Due to the importance of equipment maintenance, various preventive maintenance activities are being carried out by manufactures, and they still rely on preventive maintenance in the form of TBM (Time Base Maintenance) based on lifespan. With technological advancements, it is developing into a form of predictive maintenance that uses AI techniques to diagnose failures and take proactive measures. In this paper, a study was conducted to diagnose fan motor failure in semiconductor chamber-type equipment, and a failure diagnosis method was studied using vibration signals using AI techniques through similar data sets. First, in previous research, failure was predicted using three models (DNN, RNN, CNN) using artificial intelligence deep learning techniques, and the four vibration signals were expanded to 19 through feature engineering to compare failure predictions using the same three models. Through analysis, the performance of the model algorithm was improved. In addition, most AI research studies failure diagnosis methodologies through batch-level time series data. Since semiconductor production sites are equipment that operates 24 hours a day, normal data is learned using streaming real-time data, and when abnormal data is detected, the autoencoder technique is used to classify it as a failure, to verify performance and diagnose failures. was studied. The implication of this study is that it is a step forward from research on improving algorithm performance using typical artificial intelligence techniques, and has progressed to improve performance through feature engineering. We visualized failure prediction by incorporating an autoencoder algorithm that can be actually applied in industrial sites, predicted anomaly scores by learning normal states, and analyzed the differences when abnormal data occurs to verify that failure prediction is possible. In addition, since abnormal data can be predicted using normal learning data, outliers can be graded by grade based on the maximum Anomaly Score of normal learning data. It can be used to implement a predictive maintenance system that can classify the maintenance status of facilities into normal operation, monitoring status, and maintenance status."

However, research on the intelligence of mechanical structures is rare. This study examined the possibility of learning structural loads, which is an important factor in the design and analysis of machines, using long short-term memory (LSTM), which is a Recurrent Neural Network. Because the machine structure operates for a long time, the investigation of the possibility of load learning using Long Short-Term Memory with a memory function for the short and long terms can have important implications for recognizing and predicting accidents and damage during the operation period. Depending on the size of the load, the data entered sequentially tended to be related to predictive accuracy, from relatively old low loads that required long-term memory to large loads that required new and short-term memory. Because the amount of data obtained by structural analysis is insufficient for learning Artificial Neural Networks, its usefulness was confirmed by investigating the possibility of utilizing the data that amplified the data calculated as a result of the structural analysis using the stacked autoencoder."

Identification of Preeclamptic Placenta in Whole Slide Images Using Artificial Intelligence Placenta Analysis,2024,"['Placenta', 'Preeclampsia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Unsupervised Learning']",,"Background: Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive pregnancy disorder linked to placental dysfunction, often involving pathological lesions like acute atherosis, decidual vasculopathy, accelerated villous maturation, and fibrinoid deposition. However, there is no gold standard for the pathological diagnosis of PE and this limits the ability of clinicians to distinguish between PE and non-PE pregnancies. Recent advances in computational pathology have provided the opportunity to automate pathological analysis for diagnosis, classification, prediction, and prediction of disease progression. In this study, we assessed whether computational pathology could be used to identify PE placentas.Methods: A total of 168 placental whole-slide images (WSIs) of patients from Seoul National University Hospital (comprising 84 PE cases and 84 normal controls) were used for model development and internal validation. For external validation of the model, 76 placental slides (including 38 PE cases and 38 normal controls) were obtained from the Boramae Medical Center (BMC). To establish standard criteria for diagnosing PE and distinguishing it from controls using placental WSIs, patch characteristics and quantification of terminal and intermediate villi were employed. In unsupervised learning, K-means clustering was conducted as a feature obtained through an Auto Encoder to extract the ratio of each cluster for each WSI. For supervised learning, quantitative assessments of the villi were obtained using a U-Net-based segmentation algorithm. The prediction model was developed using an ensemble method and was compared with a clinical feature model developed by using placental size features.Results: Using ensemble modeling, we developed a model to identify PE placentas.The model showed good performance (area under the precision-recall curve [AUPRC], 0.771; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.752–0.790), with 77.3% of sensitivity and 71.1% of specificity, whereas the clinical feature model showed an AUPRC 0.713 (95% CI, 0.694–0.732) with 55.6% sensitivity and 86.8% specificity. External validation of the predictive model employing the BMC-derived set of placental slides also showed good discrimination (AUPRC, 0.725; 95% CI, 0.720–0.730).Conclusion: The proposed computational pathology model demonstrated a strong ability to identify preeclamptic placentas. Computational pathology has the potential to improve the identification of PE placentas."
