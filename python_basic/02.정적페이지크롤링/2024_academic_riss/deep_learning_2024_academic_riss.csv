"Accurate, automated classification of radiographic knee osteoarthritis severity using a novel method of deep learning: Plug-in modules",2024,"['Knee osteoarthritis', 'Deep learning', 'Classification']",,"Background Fine-grained classification deals with data with a large degree of similarity, such as cat or bird species, and similarly, knee osteoarthritis severity classification [Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading] is one such fine-grained classification task. Recently, a plug-in module (PIM) that can be integrated into convolutional neural-network-based or transformer-based networks has been shown to provide strong discriminative regions for fine-grained classification, with results that outperformed the previous deep learning models. PIM utilizes each pixel of an image as an independent feature and can subsequently better classify images with minor differences. It was hypothesized that, as a fine-grained classification task, knee osteoarthritis severity may be classified well using PIMs. The aim of the study was to develop this automated knee osteoarthritis classification model.Methods A deep learning model that classifies knee osteoarthritis severity of a radiograph was developed utilizing PIMs. A retrospective analysis on prospectively collected data was performed. The model was trained and developed using the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset and was subsequently tested on an independent dataset, the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (test set size: 17,040). The final deep learning model was designed through an ensemble of four different PIMs.Results The accuracy of the model was 84%, 43%, 70%, 81%, and 96% for KL grade 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, with an overall accuracy of 75.7%.Conclusions The ensemble of PIMs could classify knee osteoarthritis severity using simple radiographs with a fine accuracy. Although improvements will be needed in the future, the model has been proven to have the potential to be clinically useful."

This study evaluates an advanced deep learning (DL) model, building upon a precursor, for its proficiency in generating uniform and precise alignment measurements in full-leg radiographs irrespective of institutional imaging differences.Methods The enhanced DL model was trained on over 10,000 radiographs. Utilizing a segmented approach, it separately identified and evaluated regions of interest (ROIs) for the hip, knee, and ankle, subsequently integrating these regions. For external validation, 300 datasets from three distinct institutes with varied imaging protocols and equipment were employed. The study measured seven radiologic parameters: hip-knee-ankle angle, lateral distal femoral angle, medial proximal tibial angle, joint line convergence angle, weight-bearing line ratio, joint line obliquity angle, and lateral distal tibial angle. Measurements by the model were compared with an orthopedic specialist’s evaluations using inter-observer and intra-observer intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Additionally, the absolute error percentage in alignment measurements was assessed, and the processing duration for radiograph evaluation was recorded.Results The DL model exhibited excellent performance, achieving an inter-observer ICC between 0.936 and 0.997, on par with an orthopedic specialist, and an intra-observer ICC of 1.000. The model’s consistency was robust across different institutional imaging protocols. Its accuracy was particularly notable in measuring the hip-knee-ankle angle, with no instances of absolute error exceeding 1.5 degrees. The enhanced model significantly improved processing speed, reducing the time by 30-fold from an initial 10–11 s to 300 ms.Conclusions The enhanced DL model demonstrated its ability for accurate, rapid alignment measurements in fullleg radiographs, regardless of protocol variations, signifying its potential for broad clinical and research applicability."
A deep learning based automatic two-dimensional digital templating model for total knee arthroplasty,2024,"['Total knee arthroplasty', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Preoperative templating', 'Implant size prediction']",,"Background Preoperative templating is an important step for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), facilitating hospital personnel in the anticipation and preparation of necessary surgical resources. Despite its importance, this process currently lacks automation. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to automate implant size prediction.Methods A total of 13,281 (2938 anteroposterior, 10,343 lateral) knee radiographs obtained from the authors’ institute were utilized for model training, with 2302 (1034 anteroposterior, 1268 lateral) images set apart for validation and testing. The templating AI model integrates a pipeline composed of multiple steps for automated implant size estimation. To predict implant size, anterioposterior (AP) and lateral radiograph predictions were merged, selecting the smaller of the predicted sizes to prevent implant overhang. The model’s size predictions were validated with 81 real TKA data set apart from the training data, and its accuracy was compared to that of manual templating by an orthopedic specialist. Predictions matching the actual implanted sizes were labeled “exact” and those within one size, “accurate.” The influence of patient characteristics on the model’s prediction accuracy was also analyzed. The measurement time elapsed for implant sizing was recorded for both the AI model and the orthopedic specialist. Implant position predicted by the model was validated by comparing insert locations with postoperative images.Results Compared with data from 81 actual TKA procedures, the model provided exact predictions for 39.5% of femoral and 43.2% of tibial components. Allowing a one-size margin of error, 88.9% of predictions were deemed “accurate” for both components. Interobserver reliability (Cohen’s kappa) were 0.60 and 0.70 for femoral and tibial implants, respectively, both classified as “substantial.” The orthopedic specialist produced results accurate within one-size margin of error in 95.1% and 100% of cases for femoral and tibial components, respectively. Interobserver reliability between the orthopedic specialist and ground truth was 0.76 and 0.8 for femoral and tibial components, respectively. The measurement time per case was 48.7 s for the AI model, compared with 97.5 s for the orthopedic specialist. Compared with postoperative radiographs, predicted implant position had an error of less than 4 mm on average.Conclusions An AI-based templating tool for TKA was successfully developed, demonstrating satisfactory accuracy and efficiency. Its application could significantly reduce the clinical workload in TKA preparation."
Evaluation of a deep learning software for automated measurements on full-leg standing radiographs,2024,"['Leg measurements', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Radiography']",,"Background Precise lower limb measurements are crucial for assessing musculoskeletal health; fully automated solutions have the potential to enhance standardization and reproducibility of these measurements. This study compared the measurements performed by BoneMetrics (Gleamer, Paris, France), a commercial artificial intelligence (AI)-based software, to expert manual measurements on anteroposterior full-leg standing radiographs.Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on a dataset comprising consecutive anteroposterior full-leg standing radiographs obtained from four imaging institutions. Key anatomical landmarks to define the hip-knee- ankle angle, pelvic obliquity, leg length, femoral length, and tibial length were annotated independently by two expert musculoskeletal radiologists and served as the ground truth. The performance of the AI was compared against these reference measurements using the mean absolute error, Bland-Altman analyses, and intraclass correlation coefficients.Results A total of 175 anteroposterior full-leg standing radiographs from 167 patients were included in the final dataset (mean age = 49.9 ± 23.6 years old; 103 women and 64 men). Mean absolute error values were 0.30° (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.28, 0.32]) for the hip-knee-ankle angle, 0.75 mm (95% CI [0.60, 0.88]) for pelvic obliquity, 1.03 mm (95% CI [0.91,1.14]) for leg length from the top of the femoral head, 1.45 mm (95% CI [1.33, 1.60]) for leg length from the center of the femoral head, 0.95 mm (95% CI [0.85, 1.04]) for femoral length from the top of the femoral head, 1.23 mm (95% CI [1.12, 1.32]) for femoral length from the center of the femoral head, and 1.38 mm (95% CI [1.21, 1.52]) for tibial length. The Bland-Altman analyses revealed no systematic bias across all measurements. Additionally, the software exhibited excellent agreement with the gold-standard measurements with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values above 0.97 for all parameters.Conclusions Automated measurements on anteroposterior full-leg standing radiographs offer a reliable alternative to manual assessments.

Crop Leaf Disease Identification Using Deep Transfer Learning,2024,"['Agricultural Artificial Intelligence', 'Crop Leaf Disease Identification', 'Plant Protection', 'Transfer Learning']",,"Traditional manual identification of crop leaf diseases is challenging. Owing to the limitations in manpower and resources, it is challenging to explore crop diseases on a large scale. The emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly the extensive application of deep learning technologies, is expected to overcome these challenges and greatly improve the accuracy and efficiency of crop disease identification. Crop leaf disease identification models have been designed and trained using large-scale training data, enabling them to predict different categories of diseases from unlabeled crop leaves. However, these models, which possess strong feature representation capabilities, require substantial training data, and there is often a shortage of such datasets in practical farming scenarios. To address this issue and improve the feature learning abilities of models, this study proposes a deep transfer learning adaptation strategy. The novel proposed method aims to transfer the weights and parameters from pre-trained models in similar large-scale training datasets, such as ImageNet. ImageNet pre-trained weights are adopted and fine-tuned with the features of crop leaf diseases to improve prediction ability. In this study, we collected 16,060 crop leaf disease images, spanning 12 categories, for training. The experimental results demonstrate that an impressive accuracy of 98% is achieved using the proposed method on the transferred ResNet-50 model, thereby confirming the effectiveness of our transfer learning approach."

The study was conducted using phantoms and patients, and CT images were obtained while adjusting the intensity of DLIR to low (DLIR-L), middle (DLIR-M), and high (DLIR-H). To quantitatively evaluate image quality, the coefficient of variation (COV) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), as well as natural image quality evaluation (NIQE) and blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE), were used. In both the noise level and blind quality evaluation results, a higher strength of DLIR resulted in better results derived from the phantom and patient studies. In particular, the results of the phantom study confirmed that NIQE and BRISQUE of CT images acquired using DLIR-H were improved by approximately 5 % and 1 %, respectively, compared to the corresponding the application of DLIR-L. Moreover, when high-strength deep-learning was applied to a real patients CT image reconstruction method, the NIQE and BRISQUE results improved by approximately 6 % and 4 %, respectively, compared with their respective medium levels. In conclusion, we quantitatively analyzed the image quality according to the intensity of the recently developed deep-learning-based CT image reconstruction method."

UAV Head-On Situation Maneuver Generation Using Transfer-Learning-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning,2024,['Air-to-air maneuver · Transfer  learning · Head-on · UAV'],,"Recently, the demand for unmanned aerial vehicle technology has increased. In particular, AI pilots through reinforcement learning (RL) are more flexible than those using rule-based methods. Further, AI pilots with RL are expected to replace human pilots in the future. In a recent study, rather than completely replacing humans, studies on AI pilots are conducted toward the collaboration between man and unmanned aircraft. AI pilots have several advantages over humans. For example, on the one hand, human pilots avoid head-on situations due to collision. On the other hand, AI pilots may prefer head-on situations to finish the episode quickly. This study proposes a two-circle-based transfer learning method to demonstrate excellent performance in head-on situations. Based on the experimental results, the proposed two-circle-based multi-task transfer learning model outperforms the model without transfer learning-based RL. A study on transfer-learning-based learning technique has been conducted. However, it had a one-circle-based learning technique was specialized only for tail-chasing, limiting its application (Bae et al. in IEEE Access 11:26427–26440, 2023). Practically, the proposed two-circle-based learning technique outperforms the one-circle-based transfer learning technique in head-on situations."

A Cost-Effective Blind Spot Detection System with High Recall Rate using Deep Learning and a Comparative Analysis of Implementation Hardware Platforms,2024,"['Blind Spot Detection', 'Advanced Driver Assistance Systems', 'Deep Learning Accelerator', 'FPGA', 'ResNet-18', 'Energy Efficiency', 'Automotive Safety', 'Vehicle Detection', 'Model Parameter Quantization']",,"Blind Spot Detection (BSD) is critical for enhancing vehicle safety and is an integral component of many Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). In this work, we propose a novel, cost-effective BSD solution utilizing a deep learning approach with the vehicle’s existing rearview camera. While previous works such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used for BSD, these approaches often struggle to maintain high accuracy, particularly in diverse real-world environments. To address these limitations, we employed ResNet-18, a deep learning network, to improve both recall and precision in detecting vehicles in the blind spot.

Comparative analysis of chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) diagnosis in rat kidneys using an artificial intelligence deep learning model,2024,['Deep learning · Histopathology · Chronic progressive nephropathy · YOLOv8 · Mask R-CNN · SOLOv2'],,"With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), technologies based on machines and deep learning are being used in many academic fields. In toxicopathology, research is actively underway to analyze whole slide image (WSI)-level images using AI deep-learning models. However, few studies have been conducted on models for diagnosing complex lesions comprising multiple lesions. Therefore, this study used deep learning segmentation models (YOLOv8, Mask R-CNN, and SOLOv2) to identify three representative lesions (tubular basophilia with atrophy, mononuclear cell infiltration, and hyaline casts) of chronic progressive nephropathy of the kidney, a complex lesion observed in a non-clinical test using rats and selected an initial model appropriate for diagnosing complex lesions by analyzing the characteristics of each algorithm. Approximately 2000 images containing three lesions were extracted using 33 WSI of rat kidneys with chronic progressive nephropathy.Among them, 1701 images were divided into first and second rounds of learning. The loss and mAP50 values were measured twice to confirm the performances of the three algorithms. Loss measurements were stopped at an appropriate epoch to prevent overfitting, and the loss value decreased in the second round based on the data learned in the first round. After measuring the accuracy twice, detection using Mask R-CNN showed the highest mAP50 in all lesions among the three models and was considered sufficient as an initial model for diagnosing complex lesions. By contrast, the YOLOv8 and SOLOv2 models showed low accuracy for all three lesions and had difficulty with segmentation tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes a Mask R-CNN as the initial model for segmenting complex lesions. Precise diagnosis is possible if the model can be trained by increasing the input data, thereby providing greater accuracy in diagnosing pathological images."
Improving the quality of light-field data extracted from a hologram using deep learning,2024,"['deep learning', 'generative adversarial network', 'holography', 'light field', 'speckle noise']",,"We propose a method to suppress the speckle noise and blur effects of the light field extracted from a hologram using a deep-learning technique. The light field can be extracted by bandpass filtering in the hologram's frequency domain. The extracted light field has reduced spatial resolution owing to the limited passband size of the bandpass filter and the blurring that occurs when the object is far from the hologram plane and also contains speckle noise caused by the random phase distribution of the three-dimensional object surface. These limitations degrade the reconstruction quality of the hologram resynthesized using the extracted light field. In the proposed method, a deep-learning model based on a generative adversarial network is designed to suppress speckle noise and blurring, resulting in improved quality of the light field extracted from the hologram. The model is trained using pairs of original two-dimensional images and their corresponding light-field data extracted from the complex field generated by the images. Validation of the proposed method is performed using light-field data extracted from holograms of objects with single and multiple depths and mesh-based computer-generated holograms."
Deep Learning-based UHF RFID Tag Collision Detection Method,2024,"['Deep learning', 'UHF', 'RFID', 'Tag']",,"This paper presents a novel deep learning-based radio frequency identification (RFID) tag collision detection method for ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID. UHF RFID technology provides longer communication range compared to NFC, barcode, and QR code technology. However, due to the longer range, multiple tags in wide range may reply simultaneously such that a reader receives superposed signal of multiple tags. Multiple tag signals interfere with each other such that reader’s tag reading speed is decreased. In order to detect these tag collisions, previous studies utilized analytical methods rather than theoretical ones. Hence, a deep learning-based solution can improve the detection performance. For deep learning, training datasets are generated from mathematical equations, which are specified by the standard, with various delay times, amplitude differences, phase differences and noise level among tag signals.Arbitrary delay time, phase difference, and amplitude difference are used in every run of simulation.Simulation results show that the detection performance using the proposed method is about 5 dB better than that of existing method."

An Explainable Deep Learning-Based Classification Method for Facial Image Quality Assessment,2024,"['Explainable Deep Learning', 'Face Image Quality Assessment', 'Image Classification', 'MobileNet', 'Transfer Learning']",,"Considering factors such as illumination, camera quality variations, and background-specific variations, identifyinga face using a smartphone-based facial image capture application is challenging. Face Image QualityAssessment refers to the process of taking a face image as input and producing some form of ""quality"" estimateas an output. Typically, quality assessment techniques use deep learning methods to categorize images. Themodels used in deep learning are shown as black boxes. This raises the question of the trustworthiness of themodels. Several explainability techniques have gained importance in building this trust. Explainability techniquesprovide visual evidence of the active regions within an image on which the deep learning model makes aprediction. Here, we developed a technique for reliable prediction of facial images before medical analysis andsecurity operations. A combination of gradient-weighted class activation mapping and local interpretable modelagnostic explanations were used to explain the model. This approach has been implemented in the preselection of facial images for skin feature extraction, which is important in critical medical science applications. We demonstrate that the use of combined explanations provides better visual explanations for the model, whereboth the saliency map and perturbation-based explainability techniques verify predictions."

As global rice consumption rises, yields and quality must be maintained. Various methodologies were employed to identify pests, encompassing sensor-based technologies, deep learning, and remote sensing models. Visual inspection by professionals and farmers remains essential, but integrating technology such as satellites, IoT-based sensors, and drones enhances efficiency and accuracy. A computer vision system processes images to detect pests automatically. It gives real-time data for proactive and targeted pest management. With this motive in mind, this research provides a novel farmland fertility algorithm with a deep learning-based automated rice pest detection and classification (FFADL-ARPDC) technique.

We present an algorithm that measures radiologic parameters of distal radius fractures using a deep learning technique and compares the predicted parameters with those measured by an orthopedic hand surgeon.Methods: We collected anteroposterior (AP) and lateral X-ray images of 634 wrists in 624 patients with distal radius fractures treated conservatively with a follow-up of at least 2 months. We allocated 507 AP and 507 lateral images to the training set (80% of the images were used to train the model, and 20% were utilized for validation) and 127 AP and 127 lateral images to the test set. The margins of the radius and ulna were annotated for ground truth, and the scaphoid in the lateral views was annotated in the box configuration to determine the volar side of the images. Radius segmentation was performed using attention U-Net, and the volar/dorsal side was identified using a detection and classification model based on RetinaNet. The proposed algorithm measures the radial inclination, dorsal or volar tilt, and radial height by index axes and points from the segmented radius and ulna.Results: The segmentation model for the radius exhibited an accuracy of 99.98% and a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 98.07% for AP images, and an accuracy of 99.75% and a DSC of 94.84% for lateral images.

End-to-end Facial Recognition Deep Learning Model Specialized for Facial Angle using Gray Image,2024,"['Face recognition', 'Angle', 'Gray image', 'InceptionResnet']",,"Face-recognition using deep-learning techniques typically face problems with learning about angles and with flexibility.  In this study, we propose a face recognition system specialized for angles by using gray images.

Application of deep learning for semantic segmentation in robotic prostatectomy: Comparison of convolutional neural networks and visual transformers,2024,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Computer vision systems', 'Deep learning', 'Prostatectomy']",,"Purpose: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental part of the surgical application of deep learning. Traditionally, segmentation in vision tasks has been performed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but the transformer architecture has recently been introduced and widely investigated. We aimed to investigate the performance of deep learning models in segmentation in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and identify which of the architectures is superior for segmentation in robotic surgery.Materials and Methods: Intraoperative images during RARP were obtained. The dataset was randomly split into training and validation data. Segmentation of the surgical instruments, bladder, prostate, vas and seminal vesicle was performed using three CNN models (DeepLabv3, MANet, and U-Net++) and three transformers (SegFormer, BEiT, and DPT), and their performances were analyzed.Results: The overall segmentation performance during RARP varied across different model architectures. For the CNN models, DeepLabV3 achieved a mean Dice score of 0.938, MANet scored 0.944, and U-Net++ reached 0.930. For the transformer architectures, SegFormer attained a mean Dice score of 0.919, BEiT scored 0.916, and DPT achieved 0.940. The performance of CNN models was superior to that of transformer models in segmenting the prostate, vas, and seminal vesicle.Conclusions: Deep learning models provided accurate segmentation of the surgical instruments and anatomical structures observed during RARP. Both CNN and transformer models showed reliable predictions in the segmentation task; however, CNN models may be more suitable than transformer models for organ segmentation and may be more applicable in unusual cases. Further research with large datasets is needed."
Temporomandibular Joint Segmentation Using Deep Learning for Automated Three-Dimensional Reconstruction,2024,"['Cone beam computed tomography', 'Deep learning', 'Segmentation', 'Temporomandibular joint', 'U-Net']",,"Purpose: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used to evaluate the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). For the three-dimensional (3D) assessment of the TMJ, segmentation of the mandibular condyle and articular fossa is essential. This study aimed to perform deep learning-based 3D segmentation of the mandibular condyle on CBCT images and evaluate the performance of the segmentation.Methods: CBCT scan data from 99 patients (mean age: 53.3±19.2 years) diagnosed with TMJ disorders were analyzed. From the CBCT images, sagittal, coronal, and axial planes showing the mandibular condyle were selected and combined to form two-dimensional (2D) images. The U-Net deep learning model was used to exclusively segment the mandibular condyle area from the 2D images. From these results, 3D images of the mandibular condyle were reconstructed. Accuracy, precision, recall, and the Dice coefficient were calculated to appraise segmentation performance in each plane.Results: The average Dice coefficient was 0.92 for the coronal and axial planes and 0.82 for the sagittal plane. The CBCT image-based segmentation performance of the mandibular condyle in the coronal and axial planes exceeded that in the sagittal plane. The sharpness and uniformity of the 2D images affected segmentation performance, with segmentation errors more likely occurring in non-uniform images. Certain segmentation errors were corrected through software processing. Finally, the segmented mandibular condyle images were applied to the CBCT data to reconstruct a 3D TMJ model.Conclusions: Mandibular condyle 3D segmentation on CBCT images using U-Net may help evaluate and diagnose TMJ disorders. The proposed segmentation method may assist clinicians in efficiently analyzing CBCT images, particularly in cases involving anatomical abnormalities."
Clinical validity and precision of deep learning-based cone-beam computed tomography automatic landmarking algorithm,2024,"['Cone-Beam Computed Tomography', 'Anatomic Landmarks', 'Cephalometry', 'Deep Learning', 'Orthognathic Surgery']",,"Purpose: This study was performed to assess the clinical validity and accuracy of a deep learning-based automatic landmarking algorithm for cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Three-dimensional (3D) CBCT head measurements obtained through manual and automatic landmarking were compared.Materials and Methods: A total of 80 CBCT scans were divided into 3 groups: non-surgical (39 cases); surgical without hardware, namely surgical plates and mini-screws (9 cases); and surgical with hardware (32 cases). Each CBCT scan was analyzed to obtain 53 measurements, comprising 27 lengths, 21 angles, and 5 ratios, which were determined based on 65 landmarks identified using either a manual or a 3D automatic landmark detection method. Results: In comparing measurement values derived from manual and artificial intelligence landmarking, 6 items displayed significant differences: R U6CP-L U6CP, R L3CP-L L3CP, S-N, Or_R-R U3CP, L1L to Me-GoL, and GoR-Gn/S-N (P<0.05). Of the 3 groups, the surgical scans without hardware exhibited the lowest error, reflecting the smallest difference in measurements between human- and artificial intelligence-based landmarking. The time required to identify 65 landmarks was approximately 40-60 minutes per CBCT volume when done manually, compared to 10.9 seconds for the artificial intelligence method (PC specifications: GeForce 2080Ti, 64GB RAM, and an Intel i7 CPU at 3.6 GHz).Conclusion: Measurements obtained with a deep learning-based CBCT automatic landmarking algorithm were similar in accuracy to values derived from manually determined points. By decreasing the time required to calculate these measurements, the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment may be improved."
Examining the impacts of a movie trailer on box office performance with multi-modal deep learning approaches,2024,"['Movie Trailers', 'Box Office Performance Prediction', 'Deep Learning', 'Multi-modal Approach', '영화 예고편 동영상', '영화 흥행 예측', '딥러닝', '멀티 모달 분석']",,"Movie trailers are known to be one of the most effective means of promoting a movie. They play a crucial role in helping audiences decide whether or not to watch a film, as they provide information about the plot, mood, scale, characters, and more. However, despite their importance, the impact of movie trailers on box office performance has not been systematically studied. To bridge the gap in the literature, this paper employs deep learning algorithms to extract visual, auditory, and dialogue features from movie trailers. Using these features, we analyze the impact of movie trailers on box office performance through a multi-modal approach utilizing deep learning-based models. Analyzing 296 movies released in South Korea from 2017 to 2023 revealed that the most accurate prediction of a movie’s box office success was achieved by considering the collective impact of different features of a trailer, rather than considering each feature separately. We also found that our model most accurately predicted the cumulative number of movie’ viewers up to the seven days after a movie’s release. Finally, the results showed that the genre of the movie did not significantly impact the effectiveness of movie trailers in predicting the box office performance. We believe that the present study makes a contribution to the field as it comprehensively analyzed the impact of movie trailers on the box office performance from a multifaceted perspective using a variety of deep learning algorithms."

Benchmark study on a novel online dataset for standard evaluation of deep learning-based pavement cracks classification models,2024,"['Convolutional neural networks', 'Pavement cracks', 'Deep learning', 'Benchmark study', 'Crack classification']",,"Highway agencies and practitioners expect to have the most efficient method with adequate accuracy when choosing a deep learning-based model for pavement crack classification. However, many works are implemented on their own dataset, making them hard to compare with each other, and also less persuasive and robust. Therefore, a Road Cracks Classification Dataset is proposed to serve as a standard and open-source dataset. Based on this dataset, a benchmark study of fourteen deep learning classification methods is evaluated. Two parameters, the Ratio of F1 and Training Time (RFT) and Ratio of F1 and Prediction Time (RFP), are proposed to quantify the efficiency of networks. The results show that ConvNeXt_base reaches the highest accuracy among all models but requires the longest training time. AlexNet takes the least training time among all models, but gains the lowest accuracy. Of the four crack types, the block crack has the lowest accuracy, which means it is the most difficult to detect. SqueezeNet1_0 has the highest efficiency among all models in converting the computing power to accuracy. Wide ResNet 50_2 consumes the longest prediction time among CNN models, while the ConvNeXt_base has the highest feasibility on real-time tasks. To implement a suitable deep learning-based pavement crack inspection, we recommend a good balance between computational cost and accuracy. Based on this, we provide practical recommendations according to different user groups."
An Analysis of the Predictive Power of Four Models in Machine Learning and Deep Learning: Focusing on the Reviews of the Movie Noryang,2024,"['빅 데이터', '기계학습', '딥러닝', '모델', '인공지능', 'big data', 'machine learning', 'deep learning', 'model', 'AI']",,"This article is two-fold. The ultimate goal of this article is to provide a big data analysis of 330 reviews of the movie Noryang and to evaluate the Naive Bayes model, the Random Forests model, the DNN model, and the LSTM model in machine learning and deep learning. A point to note is that the name Yi, Sun-shin was the most widely used by viewers, followed by the word movie, and the word general, in that order. A major point of this article is that the name Yi, Sun-shin and the word movie showed up twice as the first keyword. This in turn implies that these keywords are the most noteworthy ones. The sentiment analysis argues that about 75% of viewers think of the film as well-made and that they were highly satisfied with it. In this paper, we used the Naive Bayes model, the Random Forests model, the DNN model, and the LSTM model and made them predict whether each review is positive or negative. The Random Forests model works well for our data, whereas the Naive Bayes model does not. When learning took place 25 times, the DNN model worked well for our data (its accuracy rate is 82.76%). When it comes to the LSTM model, its accuracy did not improve even though learning took place 9 times. Yet, the LSTM model is slightly better than the DNN model with respect to the accuracy rate of test data."

Multilevel LAs (MLAs) can be used to mitigate intensity fluctuations in the received OOK signal by their nonlinear gain characteristics; however, it is ineffective in the case of high scintillation, owing to degradation of the OOK signal’s extinction ratio. Therefore, a DL technique is applied to realize effective scintillation compensation in single-LA applications. Fully connected (FC) networks and fully connected neural networks (FCNN), which have nonlinear modeling characteristics, are deployed in this work. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulations under various scintillation effects.Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional adaptive-thresholddecision, single-LA-based, MLA-based, FC-based, and FCNN-based OOK detection techniques."

While the 10-second grip and release (10-s G&R) test is a common clinical tool for evaluating hand function, a more accessible method is warranted.This study explores the use of deep learning-enhanced hand grip and release test (DL-HGRT) for predicting DCM and evaluates its capability to reduce the duration of the 10-s G&R test.Methods: The retrospective study included 508 DCM patients and 1,194 control subjects.Propensity score matching (PSM) was utilized to minimize the confounding effects related to age and sex. Videos of the 10-s G&R test were captured using a smartphone application.The 3D-MobileNetV2 was utilized for analysis, generating a series of parameters. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curves were employed to assess the performance of the 10-s G&R test in predicting DCM and to evaluate the effectiveness of a shortened testing duration.Results: Patients with DCM exhibited impairments in most 10-s G&R test parameters. Before PSM, the number of cycles achieved the best diagnostic performance (area under the curve [AUC], 0.85; sensitivity, 80.12%; specificity, 74.29% at 20 cycles), followed by average grip time. Following PSM for age and gender, the AUC remained above 0.80. The average grip time achieved the highest AUC of 0.83 after 6 seconds, plateauing with no significant improvement in extending the duration to 10 seconds, indicating that 6 seconds is an adequate timeframe to efficiently evaluate hand motor dysfunction in DCM based on DLHGRT.Conclusion: DL-HGRT demonstrates potential as a promising supplementary tool for predicting DCM. Notably, a testing duration of 6 seconds appears to be sufficient for accurate assessment, enhancing the test more feasible and practical without compromising diagnostic performance."

While 18F-FP-CIT PET offers advantages in spatial resolution and sensitivity over123I-β-CIT or 123I-FP-CIT SPECT imaging, accurate quantification remains essential. This study presents a novel automaticquantification method for 18F-FP-CIT PET images, utilizing an artificial intelligence (AI)-based robust PET spatial normalization(SN) technology that eliminates the need for anatomical images.Methods The proposed SN engine consists of convolutional neural networks, trained using 213 paired datasets of 18F-FPCITPET and 3D structural MRI. Remarkably, only PET images are required as input during inference. A cyclic trainingstrategy enables backward deformation from template to individual space. An additional 89 paired 18F-FP-CIT PET and3D MRI datasets were used to evaluate the accuracy of striatal activity quantification. MRI-based PET quantification usingFIRST software was also conducted for comparison. The proposed method was also validated using 135 external datasets.Results The proposed AI-based method successfully generated spatially normalized 18F-FP-CIT PET images, obviating theneed for CT or MRI. The striatal PET activity determined by proposed PET-only method and MRI-based PET quantificationusing FIRST algorithm were highly correlated, with R2 and slope ranging 0.96–0.99 and 0.98–1.02 in both internal andexternal datasets.Conclusion Our AI-based SN method enables accurate automatic quantification of striatal activity in 18F-FP-CIT brain PETimages without MRI support.

Two neuroradiologists evaluated the presence of hippocampal or temporal lobe lesions, volume loss, signal abnormalities, loss of internal structure of the hippocampus, and lesion conspicuity in the temporal lobe. Reference standards for TLE were independently constructed by neurologists using clinical and radiological findings. Subjective image quality, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were analyzed. Performance in diagnosing TLE, lesion findings, and image quality were compared among the three protocols.Results: The pooled sensitivity of 1.5-mm MRI + DLR (91.2%) for diagnosing TLE was higher than that of routine MRI (72.1%, P < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis, 1.5-mm MRI + DLR showed higher sensitivity for hippocampal lesions than routine MRI (92.7% vs. 75.0%, P = 0.001), with improved depiction of hippocampal T2 high signal intensity change (P = 0.016) and loss of internal structure (P < 0.001). However, the pooled specificity of 1.5-mm MRI + DLR (76.5%) was lower than that of routine MRI (89.2%, P = 0.004). Compared with 1.5-mm MRI without DLR, 1.5-mm MRI + DLR resulted in significantly improved pooled accuracy (91.2% vs. 73.1%, P = 0.010), image quality, SNR, and CNR (all, P < 0.001).Conclusion: The use of 1.5-mm MRI + DLR enhanced the performance of MRI in diagnosing TLE, particularly in hippocampal evaluation, because of improved depiction of hippocampal abnormalities and enhanced image quality."

Additionally, we explored the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance the detection of small cube-ball phantoms in noisy images. Laser localizations were measured manually on the acquired images. To automate the QA workfl ow, we developed a Linux server equipped with database and web servers. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) fi les were retrieved 40 times for 10 linear accelerators (LINACs).

The average and standard deviation (SD) of inter-observer variability in the X- and Y-axes were 0.06 ± 0.01 mm and 0.05 ± 0.01 mm, respectively. Absolute diff erences between manual assessment and Gaussian fi tting presented average and SD values of 0.40 ± 0.51 mm and 0.23 ± 0.24 mm, respectively. In contrast, absolute diff erences between manual assessment and CNN presented average and SD values of 0.12 ± 0.10 mm and 0.11 ± 0.09 mm, respectively.

A growing fi re incident can have devastating consequences, including property loss, environmental damage, and loss of life, which is why early fi re detection is so important. There are various detection devices such as smoke detectors, heat detectors, fi re detectors, and gas detectors that can be used in the early stages of a fi re. While early fi re detection system developments incorporating IoT technology are emerging in various industries, Smoke alarms, the most common type of smoke detector in homes and offi ces, accounted for 96.6% of all malfunctions from 2021 to July of the previous year, totaling 249,445 incidents.

This paper proposes an algorithm for early fi re detection by incorporating a deep learning-based model to compensate for the problem of non-fi re warning malfunctions, which is a shortcoming of existing detectors. Finally, for fi re detection, a bounding box for the fi re is specifi ed using a smoke detector, a thermal imaging camera, and a webcam camera trained with the Yolov7 model.Then, we propose an algorithm to remove the bounding box of non-fi re reports and malfunctions from the heating map using smoke detectors and thermal imaging cameras.

Recent advancements in trajectory planning and future location prediction stem from rapid progress in machine learning and optimization algorithms. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for Spatial-temporal transformer-based feed-forward neural networks (STTFFNs). From the traffic flow local area point of view, skip-gram model is trained on trajectory data to generate embeddings that capture the high-level features of different trajectories. These embeddings can then be used as input to a transformer-based trajectory planning model, which can generate trajectories for new objects based on the embeddings of similar trajectories in the training data. In the next step, distant regions, we embedded feedforward network is responsible for generating the distant trajectories by taking as input a set of features that represent the object's current state and historical data. One advantage of using feedforward networks for distant trajectory planning is their ability to capture long-term dependencies in the data. In the final step of forecasting for future locations, the encoder and decoder are crucial parts of the proposed technique. Spatial destinations are encoded utilizing location-based social networks(LBSN) based on visiting semantic locations. The model has been specially trained to forecast future locations using precise longitude and latitude values. Following rigorous testing on two real-world datasets, Porto and Manhattan, it was discovered that the model outperformed a prediction accuracy of 8.7% previous state-of-the-art methods."

While much work on landslide susceptibility have been done worldwide, understanding society’s vulnerability to landslides, considering house structure and socio-economic conditions, remains lacking. This research presents landslide vulnerability mapping using  advanced computing deep learning models in the Nilgiri district, India. Compared to traditional ML techniques, the deep learning neural network (DLNN) architecture demonstrates greater accuracy, particularly when dealing with more samples or significant amounts of big data. Although the standardized characteristics of multi-layer NNs  are widely known, the key benefit of DL is its organized method for training DLNN-layer organizations how to govern themselves. Therefore, one deep learning neural network and three conventional machine learning models i.e., MLP classifier and RBF neural network were opted. A total of twenty-eight physical, climatological, hydrological and socio-economic factors were considered to produce socio-economic and relative landslide vulnerability maps. Multi-collinearity diagnosis was performed to  select the appropriate factors. Several physical as well as human related factors are highly important for making the area vulnerable to landslide. To justify the vulnerability maps, several statistical methods were applied. The best model DLNN, with an area under the curve of 89.07%, shows that 43.31%, and 37.72% of areas are highly to very-highly vulnerable to landslides. The framework presented in this work establishes an ideal link between human activities and landslide vulnerability, aiding planners in making informed decisions for landslide management."

Improving Deep Learning Models Considering the Time Lags between Explanatory and Response Variables,2024,"['Deep Learning', 'Model Optimization', 'Regression Model', 'Time Lag']",,"A regression model represents the relationship between explanatory and response variables. In real life,explanatory variables often affect a response variable with a certain time lag, rather than immediately. Forexample, the marriage rate affects the birth rate with a time lag of 1 to 2 years. Although deep learning modelshave been successfully used to model various relationships, most of them do not consider the time lags betweenexplanatory and response variables. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an extension of deep learning models,which automatically finds the time lags between explanatory and response variables. The proposed methodfinds out which of the past values of the explanatory variables minimize the error of the model, and uses thefound values to determine the time lag between each explanatory variable and response variables. After determiningthe time lags between explanatory and response variables, the proposed method trains the deep learningmodel again by reflecting these time lags. Through various experiments applying the proposed method to a fewdeep learning models, we confirm that the proposed method can find a more accurate model whose error isreduced by more than 60% compared to the original model."

Taking into account two residual interference (RSI) models for FD relays, we propose a full relay selection (FRS) scheme to maximize the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio of packet transmissions aiming at improving the block error rate (BLER) and throughput of the considered system. Towards real-time configurations, we design a deep learning framework based on the FRS scheme to accurately predict the average BLER and system throughput via a short inference process.

Deep learning driven approaches can assist clinicians in the course of diagnosis of depression by recognizing subtle facial expressions and emotions in depression patients.Methods: Seventeen simulated patients who acted as depressed patients participated in this study. A trained psychiatrist structurally interviewed each participant with moderate depression in accordance with a prepared scenario and without depressive features. Interviews were video-recorded, and a facial emotion recognition algorithm was used to classify emotions of each frame.Results: Among seven emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise), sadness was expressed in a higher proportion on average in the depression-simulated group compared to the normal group. Neutral and fear were expressed in higher proportions on average in the normal group compared to the normal group. The overall distribution of emotions between the two groups was significantly different (p ＜ 0.001). Variance in emotion was significantly less in the depression-simulated group (p ＜ 0.05).Conclusion: This study suggests a novel and practical approach to understand the emotional expression of depression patients based on deep learning techniques.

Spinach leaf disease identification based on deep learning techniques,2024,['Vegetable disease\xa0· Spinach leaf\xa0· Deep learning\xa0· Spatial attention mechanism'],,"Spinach is a high-nutritional-value vegetable. However, global warming, climate change, and other essential elements, such as pests, have a negative impact on spinach growth and produce many diseases that limit and destroy the production of healthy crops, making early and correct identifcation of these diseases critical. Many studies in recent years have employed deep learning models to automatically diagnose vegetable leaf diseases. However, many of these methods are based on separate deep learning architectures, ignoring the diferent efects of diferent channels and spatial location relationships in the fea- ture map on classifcation, resulting in insufcient image representation. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated deep learning system for automatic recognition of spinach leaf disease. First, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to repeatedly train and extract important features from shallow layers to enhance the recognition of the network. Second, a novel spatial attention mechanism is introduced, which decomposes the two-dimensional space into horizontal and vertical dimensions. While paying attention to the local area, the attention weight can be mapped to the adjacent position of the lesion area, providing rich features for the model. Finally, the outer product matrix of the attention mechanism is kerneled to model the nonlinear relationship between channels using a Sigmoid kernel function, and the fnal classifcation is completed by a softmax layer. Experimental results demonstrate that the correct classifcation rate is 95.12 on our test set. This fnding demonstrates the reliability of the proposed hybrid model as an automatic identifer of spinach plant diseases, which can signifcantly contribute to providing better solutions for identifying other crop diseases in the agricultural feld."

This preliminary pilot study aimed to evaluate the clinical applicability of deep learning (DL) for assessing bone quality using panoramic (PA) radiographs compared with an implant surgeon’s subjective tactile sense and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) values.Methods: In total, PA images of 2,270 edentulous sites for implant placement were selected, and the corresponding CBCT relative gray value measurements and bone quality classification were performed using 3-dimensional dental image analysis software. Based on the pre-trained and fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture, the bone quality classification of PA images was classified into 4 levels, from D1 to D4, and Spearman correlation analyses were performed with the implant surgeon’s tactile sense and CBCT values.Results: The classification accuracy of DL was evaluated using a test dataset comprising 454 cropped PA images, and it achieved an area under the receiving characteristic curve of 0.762 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.714–0.810). Spearman correlation analysis of bone quality showed significant positive correlations with the CBCT classification (r=0.702; 95% CI, 0.651–0.747; P<0.001) and the surgeon’s tactile sense (r=0.658; 95% CI, 0.600–0.708, P<0.001) versus the DL classification.Conclusions: DL classification using PA images showed a significant and consistent correlation with CBCT classification and the surgeon’s tactile sense in classifying the bone quality at the implant placement site.

Super‑resolution deep learning image reconstruction: image quality and myocardial homogeneity in coronary computed tomography angiography,2024,"['Coronary vessel', 'Multidetector computed tomography', 'Image reconstruction', 'Myocardium']",,"Background The recently introduced super-resolution (SR) deep learning image reconstruction (DLR) is potentially effective in reducing noise level and enhancing the spatial resolution. We aimed to investigate whether SR-DLR has advantages in the overall image quality and intensity homogeneity on coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography with four different approaches: filtered-back projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction (IR), DLR, and SR-DLR. Methods Sixty-three patients (mean age, 61 ± 11 years; range, 18–81 years; 40 men) who had undergone coronary CT angiography between June and October 2022 were retrospectively included. Image noise, signal to noise ratio, and contrast to noise ratio were quantified in both proximal and distal segments of the major coronary arteries. The left ventricle myocardium contrast homogeneity was analyzed. Two independent reviewers scored overall image quality, image noise, image sharpness, and myocardial homogeneity. Results Image noise in Hounsfield units (HU) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) for the SR-DLR (11.2 ± 2.0 HU) compared to those associated with other image reconstruction methods including FBP (30.5 ± 10.5 HU), hybrid IR (20.0 ± 5.4 HU), and DLR (14.2 ± 2.5 HU) in both proximal and distal segments. SR-DLR significantly improved signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio in both the proximal and distal segments of the major coronary arteries. No significant difference was observed in the myocardial CT attenuation with SR-DLR among different segments of the left ventricle myocardium (P = 0.345). Conversely, FBP and hybrid IR resulted in inhomogeneous myocardial CT attenuation (P < 0.001). Two reviewers graded subjective image quality with SR-DLR higher than other image reconstruction techniques (P < 0.001). Conclusions SR-DLR improved image quality, demonstrated clearer delineation of distal segments of coronary arteries, and was seemingly accurate for quantifying CT attenuation in the myocardium."

A deep learning method for predicting proton beam range and spread-out Bragg peak in passive scattering mode,2024,['Proton therapy · Double scattering mode · Deep learning · Quality assurance'],,"It is difcult to calculate monitor units in the proton treatment planning system due to the complexity of using this system in the double scattering mode of proton therapy. Moreover, the range and spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) values using the conversion algorithm (CONVALGO) provided by IBA (Crange, CSOBP) are diferent from the actual measured range (Mrange) and SOBP (MSOBP) values. In this regard, the CONVALGO (FC) value (FCrange, FCSOBP) should be measured according to the quality assurance (QA) of patient treatment, which requires physical efort and time. This study, therefore, aimed to reduce the time and efort spent on QA. The predictive model was trained using six parameters. Main option, sub-option, Mrange and MSOBP were used as input values, and FCrange and FCSOBP were used as label. The trained model predicted the CONVALGO (PC) values of PCrange and PCSOBP.

Application of deep learning with bivariate models for genomic prediction of sow lifetime productivity-related traits,2024,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'Deep Learning', 'Epistatic Interaction', 'Genomic Prediction', 'Pig', 'Sow Lifetime Productivity']",,"Objective: Pig breeders cannot obtain phenotypic information at the time of selection for sow lifetime productivity (SLP). They would benefit from obtaining genetic information of candidate sows. Genomic data interpreted using deep learning (DL) techniques could contribute to the genetic improvement of SLP to maximize farm profitability because DL models capture nonlinear genetic effects such as dominance and epistasis more efficiently than conventional genomic prediction methods based on linear models. This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of DL for the genomic prediction of two SLP-related traits; lifetime number of litters (LNL) and lifetime pig production (LPP).Methods: Two bivariate DL models, convolutional neural network (CNN) and local convolutional neural network (LCNN), were compared with conventional bivariate linear models (i.e., genomic best linear unbiased prediction, Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, and Bayes B). Phenotype and pedigree data were collected from 40,011 sows that had husbandry records. Among these, 3,652 pigs were genotyped using the PorcineSNP60K BeadChip.Results: The best predictive correlation for LNL was obtained with CNN (0.28), followed by LCNN (0.26) and conventional linear models (approximately 0.21). For LPP, the best predictive correlation was also obtained with CNN (0.29), followed by LCNN (0.27) and conventional linear models (approximately 0.25). A similar trend was observed with the mean squared error of prediction for the SLP traits.Conclusion: This study provides an example of a CNN that can outperform against the linear model-based genomic prediction approaches when the nonlinear interaction components are important because LNL and LPP exhibited strong epistatic interaction components.

However, the class imbalance of the dataset often skews prediction models towards the majority class in the segmentation of damaged buildings. This issue is further exacerbated when damaged buildings are categorized into multiple scales, intensifying biases within the models. Hence, this research adopts an algorithm-level method to improve the reliability of post-disaster damage assessment. It proposes a novel loss function named Ordinal Class Distance Penalty Loss (OCDPL), considering the ordinal relationship between classes and penalizing the misclassifications according to the class error distance. Two hyperparameters are also introduced to enable the model to fine-tune the contribution of ordinal relationships on the loss function. The satellite images of hurricane disasters in the xBD dataset were adopted as the case study. The results show that the proposed approach can improve F1 scores and Mean Absolute Error of overall damage level classes. Notably, the findings underscore the value of leveraging information on ordinal classes to facilitate the learning of minority classes and diminish class error distances.

A real-time rice quantity detection system was developed using the DeepLabV3Plus network with various backbone architectures, including DenseNet121, DenseNet201, VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, and MobileNetV3 Large. DeepLabV3Plus employed Atrous Convolutional Neural Networks (ACNNs) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP). A total of 350 images of rice servings were used, with 70% for training and 30% for validation. Performance evaluation of the six backbone architectures revealed that DenseNet121 and DenseNet201 achieved the highest Mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) of 92.92%, while MobileNetV2 had the lowest at 87.70%. VGG16 demonstrated the highest computational efficiency. DenseNet201 was effective in detecting rice quantities up to 140 g, but accurate detection of larger quantities required additional height image data. All architectures achieved high top-1 validation accuracies (96.0%-96.4%), though training times varied significantly. This study emphasizes the importance of diverse training datasets and continuous model refinement to improve segmentation accuracy and efficiency. Integrating image data from top and side views is essential for detecting larger quantities.

Modeling CO2 Loading Capacity of Diethanolamine (DEA) Aqueous Solutions Using Advanced Deep Learning and Machine Learning Algorithms: Application to Carbon Capture,2024,['Carbon capture · Diethanolamine (DEA) · CO 2 loading capacity · Recurrent Neural Networks · Intelligent model'],,"Several carbon capture techniques have been developed in response to the notable rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) levels. The utilization of diethanolamine (DEA) as an absorption method is prevalent in various industries due to its high reactivity and cost-effi ciency. Hence, comprehending the equilibrium solubility of CO2 in DEA solutions is an essential step in developing and optimizing absorption procedures. In order to predict the CO2 loading capacity in the DEA solutions, four advanced deep learning and machine learning models were developed: recurrent neural networks (RNN), deep neural networks (DNN), random forest (RF), and adaBoost-support vector regression (AdaBoost-SVR). The models predict the capacity of CO2 loading as a function of temperature, CO2 partial pressure, and the concentration of DEA in the solution.Intelligent models were developed employing an extensive database which includes new experimental data points published within recent years, which were not considered in the previous studies. The RNN model was found to outperform other models based on graphical and statistical assessments, as evidenced by its lower root mean square error ( RMSE = 0.285 ) and standard deviation ( SD = 0.032 ), and higher determination coeffi cient ( R2 = 0.992 ). While the RNN model resulted in the highest accuracy in predicting CO2 absorption, the DNN, RF, and AdaBoost-SVR models also demonstrated satisfactory accuracy in predicting CO2 solubility, placed in the following ranking. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the four developed models, revealing that the CO2 partial pressure has the strongest eff ect on the CO2 loading capacity. Furthermore, a trend analysis was performed on the RNN model, demonstrating that the developed model has a high degree of accuracy in following physical trends. The binary interaction analysis was conducted with two varying parameters and one constant parameter in the RNN model through 3-D image plots, which illustrated the simultaneous eff ect of two independent parameters on CO2 loading. Finally, outlier detection was conducted by employing the Leverage method to fi nd outlier data points in the data bank, demonstrating the applicability domain of intelligent models."

Accuracy Evaluation of Homography-Based Camera Pose and Point Depth Calculation for a Deep Learning Dataset,2024,"['Homography', 'Fundamental Matrix', 'Essential Matrix', 'Camera Matrix', 'Pose', 'Depth']",,"In recent years, large datasets have been provided for DL (Deep Learning) to train the neural network in calculating camera poses and object depths from images. The datasets were typically obtained using RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue, and Depth) cameras, however, which have limitations in capturing depths in many cases. To overcome the limitations of RGB-D cameras, many DL approaches have been proposed to overcome the problems. However, the accuracy potentials of pose and depth calculated by DL approaches have not been studied well. Thus, this study selected the ScanNet dataset for the experiment and presents a method to evaluate the accuracy of pose and depth that can be obtained using point matching and homography. From the pairs of matching points in two views, their fundamental matrix, essential matrix, and camera matrix were reconstructed and then the camera pose and depth were calculated. The experimental results show that the relative rotation angles were calculated accurately by using homography and the translation angles were calculated less accurately than the rotation angles. In addition, the experiments show that the depths of matching points could be calculated with reasonable accuracy by using the camera matrix constructed by matching."

Integrated Vision and Sensor Based Analysis for Sleep Apnea Using FeatFaceNet Deep Learning,2024,['Sleep apnea · ECG · PPG · Vision based iPPG · SpO2 features · Deep learning · Classifcation · Signal processing · Bio medical engineering'],,"For the purpose of identifying sleep apnea, it's critical to have a trustworthy, distant, and non-intrusive technology for monitoring heart rate, breathing rate, and SpO2. Polysomnography (PSG) is the standard approach for diagnosing sleep apnea, but it is also an expensive and time-consuming process. It calls for a sleep lab with specifc electrode-based gear and staf with the necessary training. When the subject is sufering from any neurological conditions like Parkinson Disease (PD), all these elements combine to make the process difcult and uncomfortable for the patient. In this work, a real-time video-based and signal-based system for diagnosing sleep apnea in persons with Parkinson's disease is presented. The criteria that are required for the detection of sleep apnea in subjects are heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Here, it is possible to use a smartphone camera to detect and interpret imaging Photoplethysmography (iPPG) signals from video of a user's face in order to assess HR, RR, and oxygen saturation. In order to determine the volumetric changes in the blood fow, iPPG datas are processed in accordance with the video-based monitoring method. The Viola Jones method is employed in this research to identify faces. The iPPG signals are collected using the RGB channel approach after image segmentation to determine the region of interest (ROI) as the forehead. From the collected iPPG signals, the characteristics of the HR, RR, and SpO2 parameters are extracted and mathematically calculated. The time domain and frequency domain features are extracted from the ECG signal of the matching individuals. Using the FeatFaceNet Deep Learning technique, these features are decreased. The Ensemble Boosted SVM (EB-SVM) classifcation algorithm is utilized to categories the data into apneic conditions after feature selection. In the event of an emergency, the project's fnding may also be used to notify the medical assistant. As a result, our method enables remote sleep apnea detection for making the process cost-efective and comfortable for the individuals.

Manual brain tumor segmentation is expensive, time-consuming, error-prone, and dependent on the radiologist's expertise and experience. Manual brain tumor segmentation outcomes by different radiologists for the same patient may differ. Thus, more robust, and dependable methods are needed.

But accurate disease identifi cation is one of the complicated processes due to the existence of noisy contents and irrelevant structure of the original images. In conventional works, various medical image processing techniques have been developed for accurately classifying the types of breast cancer. Still, it confronts diffi culties due to the aspects of increased complexity in computations, error values, false positives, and misclassifi cation outputs. Hence, this research work proposes to develop an optimization-based classifi cation system for the breast cancer identifi cation system. Here, the Gaussian fi ltering and Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) techniques are utilized for preprocessing the original mammogram images by eliminating the noisy contents and enhancing the contrast of an image. Then, the Markov Random Adaptive Segmentation (MRAS) technique is employed for detecting the boundary region based on the random value selection.

In which, the global best fi tness value is estimated by using the crossover, mutation, and selection operations. Finally, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifi cation technique is utilized for categorizing the image as to whether normal or abnormal with its type. The entire performance analysis of the suggested model is validated and compared using multiple measures during the evaluation. In the proposed method GA performs feature selection and prunes unnecessary features. The major goal is to improve the classifi cation performance while reducing the number of features used.

Transcriptome-based deep learning analysis identifies drug candidates targeting protein synthesis and autophagy for the treatment of muscle wasting disorder,2024,[],,"Sarcopenia, the progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass and function, is observed in various conditions, including cancer and aging. The complex molecular biology of sarcopenia has posed challenges for the development of FDA-approved medications, which have mainly focused on dietary supplementation. Targeting a single gene may not be sufficient to address the broad range of processes involved in muscle loss. This study analyzed the gene expression signatures associated with cancer formation and 5-FU chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting. Our findings suggest that dimenhydrinate, a combination of 8-chlorotheophylline and diphenhydramine, is a potential therapeutic for sarcopenia. In vitro experiments demonstrated that dimenhydrinate promotes muscle progenitor cell proliferation through the phosphorylation of Nrf2 by 8-chlorotheophylline and promotes myotube formation through diphenhydramine-induced autophagy. Furthermore, in various in vivo sarcopenia models, dimenhydrinate induced rapid muscle tissue regeneration. It improved muscle regeneration in animals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and facilitated muscle and fat recovery in animals with chemotherapy-induced sarcopenia. As an FDA-approved drug, dimenhydrinate could be applied for sarcopenia treatment after a relatively short development period, providing hope for individuals suffering from this debilitating condition."

Among them, techniques using object detection models can monitor forest fires over wide areas 24 hours a day. However, detecting forest fires early with traditional object detection models is a very challenging task. While they show decent accuracy for thick smoke and large fires, they show low accuracy for faint smoke and small fires, and frequently generate false positives for lights that are like fires. In this paper, to solve these problems, we focus on leveraging local characteristics such as contours and textures of fire and smoke, which are crucial for accurate detection. Based on this approach, we propose EDAM (Edge driven Attention Module) that performs enhancement by richly utilizing contour and texture information of fire and smoke. EDAM extracts important edge information to generate feature maps with emphasized contour and texture information, and based on this map, performs Attention Mechanism to emphasize key characteristics of smoke and fire. Through this mechanism, the overall model performance was improved, with APsincreasing from 0.154 to 0.204 and AP0.5 from 0.779 to 0.784, resulting in a significant improvement in APsvalue to 32.47%.

Deep reinforcement learning for base station switching scheme with federated LSTM-based traffic predictions,2024,"['base station switching', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'federated learning', 'LSTM', 'traffic forecasting']",,"To meet increasing traffic requirements in mobile networks, small base stations (SBSs) are densely deployed, overlapping existing network architecture and increasing system capacity. However, densely deployed SBSs increase energy consumption and interference. Although these problems already exist because of densely deployed SBSs, even more SBSs are needed to meet increasing traffic demands. Hence, base station (BS) switching operations have been used to minimize energy consumption while guaranteeing quality-of-service (QoS) for users. In this study, to optimize energy efficiency, we propose the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to create a BS switching operation strategy with a traffic prediction model. First, a federated long short-term memory (LSTM) model is introduced to predict user traffic demands from user trajectory information. Next, the DRL-based BS switching operation scheme determines the switching operations for the SBSs using the predicted traffic demand.

Yet, accurately tracking the diet and food intake of individuals with obesity is challenging. Although 3D motion capture technology is becoming increasingly important in healthcare, its potential for detecting early signs of obesity has not been fully explored. In this research, we used a deep LSTM network trained with individual identity (identity-trained deep LSTM network) to analyze 3D time-series skeleton data from mouse models with diet-induced obesity. First, we analyzed the data from two different viewpoints: allocentric and egocentric. Second, we trained various deep recurrent networks (e.g., RNN, GRU, LSTM) to predict the identity. Lastly, we tested whether these models effectively encode obese-like motion representations by training a support vector classifier with the latent features from the last layer.

Musical Genre Classification Based on Deep Residual Auto-Encoder and Support Vector Machine,2024,"['Deep Residual Auto-Encoder', 'MFCC', 'Music Artificial Intelligence', 'Musical Genre Classification']",,"Music brings pleasure and relaxation to people. Therefore, it is necessary to classify musical genres based on scenes. Identifying favorite musical genres from massive music data is a time-consuming and laborious task. Recent studies have suggested that machine learning algorithms are effective in distinguishing between various musical genres. However, meeting the actual requirements in terms of accuracy or timeliness is challenging. In this study, a hybrid machine learning model that combines a deep residual auto-encoder (DRAE) and support vector machine (SVM) for musical genre recognition was proposed. Eight manually extracted features from the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) were employed in the preprocessing stage as the hybrid music data source.

Unfortunately, LLMs can not provide any explanation for how they reach the goal because the training is based on learning of black-box AI. Reinforcement Learning as black-box AI is based on graph-evolving structure for deriving enhanced solution through adjustment by human feedback or reinforced data. In this research, for mutually exclusive decision-making, Mutually Exclusive Learning (MEL) is proposed to provide explanations of the chosen goals that are achieved by a decision on both ends with specified conditions. In MEL, decision-making process is based on the tree-based structure that can provide processes of pruning branches that are used as explanations of how to achieve the goals. The goal can be reached by trade-off among mutually exclusive alternatives according to the specific contextual conditions.Therefore, the tree-based structure is adopted to provide feasible solutions with the explanations based on the pruning branches. The sequence of pruning processes can be used to provide the explanations of the inferences and ways to reach the goals, as Explainable AI (XAI). The learning process is based on the pruning branches according to the multi-dimensional contextual conditions.

Channel estimation and pilot reduction for mmWave massive MIMO systems using deep neural networks,2024,['Deep learningChannel estimationPilot reductionMmWave communication'],,"In this paper, we propose deep learning-based channel estimation and pilot reduction for mmWave point-to-point multi-input multi-output systems. The proposed scheme consists of a two-step approach where the first step is applying a denoising autoencoder for channel estimation. With the denoising characteristic of autoencoder, sparse channel estimation can be conducted although the orthogonality of pilot sequences is not guaranteed due to shorter pilots. The second step is exploiting the temporal correlation of the channel, using the previous estimate to extract information for the current estimate. Through simulation, the proposed scheme shows superior performance with reduced pilots."
Exploring the performance impact of soft constraint integration on reinforcement learning-based autonomous vessel navigation: Experimental insights,2024,"['Deep reinforcement learning', 'Soft constraint', 'Autonomous ship', 'Reward function', 'Artificial intelligence']",,"Reinforcement learning has shown promise in enabling autonomous ship navigation, allowing vessels to adapt and make informed decisions in complex marine environments. However, the integration of soft constraints and their impact on performance in RL-based autonomous vessel navigation research remain understudied.This research addresses this gap by investigating the implications of soft constraints in the context of the risk-averse ship navigation problem. Four distinct soft constraint functions are proposed, which are integrated with two widely used RL algorithms, resulting in the creation of eight risk-averse autonomous vessel navigation models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of their performance, comparative analyses are conducted across seven virtual digital channel environments. Additionally, a novel metric, known as Large Helm Momentum (LHM), is introduced to quantify the smoothness of autonomous vessel navigation. Through thorough experimentation, key considerations for the design of soft constraint functions in the domain of autonomous ship navigation are identified. A comprehensive understanding of how different soft constraint functions influence autonomous driving behavior has been achieved. Key considerations for designing soft constraint functions in the domain of autonomous ship navigation have also been identified. Five principles, namely the constraint association principle, dominance of hard constraints, reward-balance principle, mapping requirement principle, and iterative improvement principle, are proposed to optimize the design of soft constraint functions for autonomous ship navigation, providing valuable guidance and insights."

Nonetheless, medical FL research is anticipated to be increasingly applied and to become a vital component of multi-institutional research."
Development of Machine Learning-Based Energy Management Agent to Control Fine Dust Concentration in Railway Stations,2024,['Constrained deep-Q network  · Energy management agent  · Particulate matter  · Reinforcement learning  · Supervised learning'],,"This paper introduces a new strategy for managing energy consumption by employing a constrained deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to regulate Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. The strategy is grounded in the principles of the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which allows for the creation of a transition kernel. By utilizing an artifi cial neural network (ANN), we can predict levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 based on the given conditions and actions. This prediction helps in forming the transition kernel within the MDP framework. Using this predictive model as the transition kernel, we optimize the control policy of the energy management agent through the constrained DQN technique. This technique ensures that actions remain within specifi c constraints. We validate the eff ectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments using real data collected from Namgwangju Station. These experiments demonstrate that the introduced constraints successfully keep PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels within predefi ned thresholds at the stations. Furthermore, reducing the threshold results in more signifi cant decreases in PM levels, achieved by allocating additional power to blowers and air conditioners."

Comparative analysis of machine learning-based dose assessment algorithms for TL dosimetry,2024,"['Dose assessment algorithm', 'ANN', 'LightGBM', 'TLD', 'Machine Learning', 'Dosimetry']",,"This paper explores the implementation of machine learning-based algorithms for TL dose assessment. It focuses on the radiation field classification, performance quotient evaluation, and shallow and deep dose equivalent assessment of ANN and LGBM, in comparison to the traditional method of DT. We evaluate these algorithms based on the element response data measured by TLD. A data set was built for training, and the base element responses of test categories were amplified, and normalized to 1 mSv Cs-137 within the range of ±3 %. Both algorithms consist of five subset models for classifying radiation fields and identifying ratios of mixed fields. The LGBM showed the best accuracy in classifying considered radiation fields and the lowest performance quotients.By comparing the tolerance levels of deep dose and shallow dose equivalents among the three algorithms, the LGBM yields the smallest difference between the predicted and true dose equivalents. This smaller difference implies the LGBM offers the least bias and standard deviation in the expected value, giving higher accuracy and precision in dose assessment over the traditional DT method. The findings from this study further contribute to the adoption of ML-based algorithms for TL dose assessment, underscoring its importance in the field."
Airfoil Inverse Design Using a Deep Neural Net with an Explainable Attention Mechanism,2024,['Airfoil · Attention  mechanism · Inverse  design · Recurrent  neural  network · Explainable  artiﬁcial  intelligence (XAI)'],,"The data-driven inverse design approach has advantages over traditional methods that require domain knowledge, many constraints, and empirical formulas. However, because deep learning models are basically black-box models, that is, unin- terpretable models, explaining the causal relationship between the input and output using them is difﬁcult. This reduces the reliability of inverse design approaches based on deep learning. Therefore, in this study, an airfoil inverse design using an explainable deep neural network was developed. The airfoil shape parameters were predicted using the pressure coefﬁcient distribution. Because the distribution is considered as undirected sequence data, a bidirectional long short-term memory was used as the base of the network. To provide explainability to the network, we utilized two types of attention-applied network architectures: single-attention and multi-attention. This makes the network more accurate and explainable with good convergence. Consequently, a purely data-driven inverse design approach that does not require domain experience was estab- lished. Furthermore, a self-explanatory network without additional data mining was modeled. This attention-applied network performed predictions not only to obtain the airfoil geometry but also to determine the correlation between airfoil geometry and the local pressure distribution. The correlation obtained from the network was shown to properly reﬂect the physics of ﬂow, thereby conﬁrming that the present approach can be used to analyze physical phenomena, particularly those whose mechanisms have not yet been identiﬁed."

Surgeon-Generated Reconstructed Three-Dimensional Tomography Images Improve Surgical Outcomes on Deep Soft Tissue Lesions,2024,"['Imaging', 'three-dimensional', 'Wounds and injuries', 'Drainage', 'Foreign bodies', 'Biopsy']",,"Background: Recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of tomographic imaging have rarely been applied to wound management and soft tissue-related diseases due to the nature of imaging modality hindering automatic segmentation of the region of interest (ROI). The authors created 3D images of soft tissue lesions using open-source software and evaluated their usefulness through four clinical cases.Methods: Patients with wounds or soft tissue lesions underwent enhanced tomography. The surgeon manually segmented the ROIs and reconstructed them using 3D Slicer. The reconstructed images were overlaid on an anatomy plate or clinical pictures for clinical application. The authors conducted hands-on training and surveyed the participants before and after the course to evaluate clinical applicability and efficacy.Results: Nine plastic surgeons were enrolled. After training, their perception of applying 3D imaging on deep pus pocket drainage, foreign body removal, and deep-located lesion biopsy remained unchanged. However, their response significantly changed from likely to very likely in whether 3D reconstruction imaging of deep soft tissue lesions would help improve the surgical outcome. They answered positively in their recommendation of 3D reconstruction and its application to clinical practice. However, they responded neutrally to whether it was easy to learn. This method was found most useful for deep lesion excision planning, followed by drainage of deep concealed pus pockets, foreign body removal, and biopsies of lesions difficult to localize.Conclusion: Surgeon-generated 3D reconstruction of wounds and soft tissue lesions using open-source software can aid clinical practice, significantly improving surgical outcomes in deep soft tissue lesions."

Novel Algorithms for Early Cancer Diagnosis Using Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 in Thermal Images,2024,"['Accuracy', 'Breast cancer', 'Deep CNN', 'Fine-tuning', 'MobileNet', 'Thermographic images']",,"Breast cancer ranks among the most prevalent forms of malignancy and foremost cause of death by cancer worldwide. It is not preventable. Early and precise detection is the only remedy for lowering the rate of mortality and improving the probability of survival for victims. In contrast to present procedures, thermography aids in the early diagnosis of cancer and thereby saves lives. But the accuracy experiences detrimental impact by low sensitivity for small and deep tumours and the subjectivity by physicians in interpreting the images. Employing deep learning approaches for cancer detection can enhance the efficacy. This study explored the utilization of thermography in early identification of breast cancer with the use of a publicly released dataset known as the DMR-IR dataset. For this purpose, we employed a novel approach that entails the utilization of a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and fine tuning it through transfer learning techniques. We created three models using MobileNetV2: one was a baseline transfer learning model with weights trained from ImageNet dataset, the second was a fine-tuned model with an adaptive learning rate, and the third utilized early stopping with callbacks during fine-tuning. The results showed that the proposed methods achieved average accuracy rates of 85.15%, 95.19%, and 98.69%, respectively, with various performance indicators such as precision, sensitivity and specificity also being investigated."

Development of a Real-Time Anomaly Detection System for Dry Vacuum Pumps Using Low-Cost IoT Devices and Machine Learning,2024,"['Anomaly detection', 'Machine learning', 'IoT device', 'Low-cost', 'Vacuum pump']",,"Data-driven health diagnosis methods based on machine learning have been receiving a lot of attention with the hope that they can open a new era for mechanical researchers and engineers. Machine learning algorithms including deep learning can show insights or state trends through complicated electro-mechanical sensor signals, but it is difficult for machine learning algorithms to go beyond the given data boundaries and to generalize their inferring rules from one case to the other. Researchers have even artificially damaged common mechanical parts in their experiments to collect fault signals for machine learning training. Creating and gathering the sensor signals covering a variety of machine status may be time-consuming or impossible in reality. Anomaly detection for dry vacuum pumps started from the recognition that the artificially induced fault signals may not reflect the natural malfunctioning state of the pumps. Anomaly detection algorithms use only normal data for training, so abnormal state data is not necessarily required. In this research several anomaly detection algorithms were tested and compared with time-domain input features and frequency-domain input features when acceleration signals were injected in for training. A long short-term memory based autoencoder (LSTM-autoencoder) scheme with discrete wavelet transformed (DWT) input signals was chosen for the finalist due to its superior capability capturing the nature of normal state characteristics. The output of LSTM-autoencoder’s loss could be used as an indicator of the machine’s health deterioration. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated that the developed algorithm worked well on low-cost Internet of Things devices such as Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino Mega 2560 boards for real-time monitoring."

Selective imitation for efficient online reinforcement learning with pre-collected data,2024,['Deep reinforcement learningOff-policy reinforcement learningPre-collected dataBehavioral cloningImitation learning'],,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution for autonomous devices requiring sequential decision-making. In the online RL framework, the agent must interact with the environment to collect data, making sample efficiency the most challenging aspect. While the off-policy method in online RL partially addresses this issue by employing a replay buffer, learning speed remains slow, particularly at the beginning of training, due to the low quality of data collected with the initial policy. To overcome this challenge, we propose Reward-Adaptive Pre-collected Data RL (RAPD-RL), which leverages pre-collected data in addition to online RL. We employ two buffers: one for pre-collected data and another for online collected data. The policy is trained using both buffers to increase the objective and imitate the actions in the dataset. To maintain resistance to poor-quality (i.e., low-reward) data, our method selectively imitates data based on reward information, thereby enhancing sample efficiency and learning speed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution converges rapidly and achieves high performance across various dataset qualities."

Our proposed augmentation-based RL, termed AE-TD3, establishes an actor-ensemble network and concurrently selects one of the multiple actions from the network to explore and represent the expanded state space stably and efficiently. Experimental results showed that AE-TD3 achieved higher expected returns or improved learning stability compared with the traditional augmentation-based RL method in various continuous control tasks using MuJoCo. We believe that the proposed AE-TD3 has the potential to overcome problems associated with delayed feedback."
FedHM: Practical federated learning for heterogeneous model deployments,2024,['Federated learningHeterogeneous modelsMobile/embedded deep learning'],,"In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning framework named FedHM that aims to address the challenge of training models on heterogeneous devices with varying architectures.

Method This study analyzes ironic picture books. Ironic picture books are a literary narrative method  that uses differences between text and pictures, differences in perspectives, etc. to raise questions for  readers and have them find answers on their own. Therefore, we analyze three picture books by Kwon  Jeong-min (A Wonderland Picture Book Dictionary, A Guide to Becoming a Wise Boar, We Know  a Little About You) that present irony in various ways. The analysis tool will utilize the perspective  of deep ecology. Results The deep ecological characteristics revealed in Kwon Jeong-min's picture books can be  characterized by respect and protection of nature, the value of nature and human ignorance, and the  interaction and coexistence between nature and humans. Conclusion Kwon Jeong-min's picture books make us deeply reflect on the way humans interact and  coexist with nature. This effectively conveys the core principle of deep ecology that humans must remain  humble in their relationship with nature and live with respect for nature. Kwon Jeong-min's picture  books, which advocate ecologicalism, leave a strong impression on readers by utilizing the irony of  text and pictures. This makes readers think more deeply about environmental issues and once again  consider the impact of human behavior on nature."

Modeling Method for Classification of Piano Music Style based on Big Data Mining and Machine Learning,2024,"['Big data mining', 'Machine learning', 'Piano music', 'Hidden Markov']",,"With the progress of music digitalization, various styles of music have been produced, and effective classification of music has become an important research direction. In this research, a model for piano-music style classification was constructed based on big data mining and machine learning algorithms. The input music signal was dealt with using framing, signal enhancement, and windowing. The Meldor Frequency Coefficient (MFC) and emotional features in the signal were extracted and fused to obtain combined features. The extracted feature vectors were input into a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for training and then a hidden Markov model (HMM) for classification and recognition. However, it was found that during the HMM training process, the algorithm produces large differences in the randomly selected initial matrix parameters, which cause the results to be trapped at a local optimum and affect the accuracy of model classification and recognition. To optimize the parameters, a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the classification model. The average Relative Percent Difference (PRD) was 2.402, the run time was 2.117 s, and the accuracy was 97.074%, which means the model can efficiently and accurately classify piano music styles."

Due to the limitations in complex scenes, it is necessary to establish custom template matching and apply it to the research of many fields of computational vision technology. The dependence on high-quality small label sample database data is not very strong, and the machine learning system of deep feature connection to complete the task of texture effect inference and speculation is relatively poor. The style transfer algorithm based on neural network collects and preserves the data of patterns, extracts and modernizes their features.

Hull form optimization of fully parameterized small ships using characteristic curves and deep neural networks,2024,"['Hull form design', 'Characteristic curves', 'Hydrodynamic performance', 'Deep learning', 'Deep Neural Network (DNN)']",,"Designing a hull form typically involves beginning with a reference hull form based on ship owner requirements, editing the hull form to satisfy the requirements, and determining the most efficient hull form. Numerical analyses using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) were employed to assess the performance of the hull form.However, these analyses require extensive computational resources, making it challenging to perform thorough analyses within the design timeframe. To address this issue, this paper proposes an approach that involves defining a range of hull forms with characteristic curves, predicting their performance using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and subsequently determining the optimal hull form based on these predictions. Initially, the hull form of a small ship was defined using four characteristic curves and parameterized using 29 variables. Fairness optimization was performed using these characteristic curves to define the hull form surface. By varying 29 parameters, 896 different hull forms were generated, with CFD analysis conducted for each variant. These data were then used to build a DNN model capable of predicting the performance based on hull form parameters. The accuracy of the DNN model was evaluated, resulting in a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.835%. Subsequently, the DNN model is combined with a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal set of parameters for the hull form, resulting in an optimal hull form. This optimization process revealed that the optimal hull form reduced the total hydrodynamic resistance by approximately 7% compared to the initial reference design. Consequently, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for deriving the optimal hull form for small ships."

LiDAR sensors utilize laser beams to generate point-based 3D spatial information. However, they are vulnerable to external impact. Conversely, camera sensors, known for their affordability and durability, require indirect methods, such as stereo vision and deep learning, to generate spatial information. Creating datasets for deep learning in outdoor environments is challenging due to the absence of specialized data acquisition platforms and the time-consuming and costly process of generating manual annotations. To address these issues, this study proposes an outdoor data acquisition platform and a LiDAR-based technique to generate depth estimation datasets. The platform was employed to construct real outdoor datasets, and to conduct a qualitative evaluation of the constructed dataset. The dataset was then used to train and evaluate a depth-estimation network, validating the method's effectiveness.

This problem directly impacts the reliability of the tunnel CCTV-based accident detection system reliant on object detection performance. Hence, it is necessary to reduce the number of false positive detections while also enhancing the number of true positive detections. Based on a deep learning object detection model, this paper proposes a false positive data training method that not only reduces false positives but also improves true positive detection performance through retraining of false positive data. This paper’s false positive data training method is based on the following steps: initial training of a training dataset - inference of a validation dataset - correction of false positive data and dataset composition - addition to the training dataset and retraining. In this paper, experiments were conducted to verify the performance of this method. First, the optimal hyperparameters of the deep learning object detection model to be applied in this experiment were determined through previous experiments. Then, in this experiment, training image format was determined, and experiments were conducted sequentially to check the long-termperformance improvement through retraining of repeated false detection datasets. As a result, in the first experiment, it was found that the inclusion of the background in the inferred image was more advantageous for object detection performance than the removal of the background excluding the object. In the second experiment, it was found that retraining by accumulating false positives from each level of retraining was more advantageous than retraining independently for each level of retraining in terms of continuous improvement of object detection performance. After retraining the false positive data with the method determined in the two experiments, the car object class showed excellent inference performance with an AP value of 0.95 or higher after the first retraining, and by the fifth retraining, the inference performance was improved by about 1.06 times compared to the initial inference. And the person object class continued to improve its inference performance as retraining progressed, and by the 18th retraining, it showed that it could self-improve its inference performance by more than 2.3 times compared to the initial inference."

This study aimed to overcome the limitations of traditional methods by accounting for various environmental conditions.Comprehensive environmental and hydration data were collected using IoT sensors to capture variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and curing time. Data preprocessing included the removal of outliers and selection of relevant variables. Various modeling techniques, including regression analysis, classification and regression tree (CART), and artificial neural network (ANN), were applied to predict the heat of hydration and early compressive strength of concrete. The models were evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) to determine their effectiveness.The ANN model demonstrated superior performance, achieving a high prediction accuracy for early-age concrete strength, with an MAE of 0.297 and a predictive accuracy of 99.8%. For heat-of-hydration temperature prediction, the ANN model also outperformed the regression and CART models, exhibiting a lower MAE of 1.395. The analysis highlighted the significant impacts of temperature and curing time on the hydration process and strength development.This study confirmed that AI-based models, particularly ANNs, are highly effective in predicting early-age concrete strength and hydration temperature under varying environmental conditions. The ability of an ANN model to handle non-linear relationships and complex interactions among variables makes it a promising tool for real-time quality control in construction.

In this regard, this study proposed a fault detection technique by developing a time-variant deep learning model from multivariate sensor data analysis for estimating a current health state as four levels. In addition, it aims to establish a real-time fault detection system that allows workers to immediately identify and manage the cylinder’s status in either an actual shop floor or a remote management situation.

However, the ultimate vision for UAM is the deployment of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which is the focus of ongoing research and development. Although specific operational regulations for UAM have not been precisely defined, installation of vertiports within urban areas is anticipated. In this study, a deep-learning-based software is designed and proposed to guide UAM vehicles through aircraft marshalling, especially during critical maneuvers, such as takeoff, landing, and ground movements. A bounding-box-based object detection algorithm is utilized to differentiate effectively between pedestrians and aircraft security personnel, thereby recognizing objects of interest. Upon detection of aircraft marshalling, the proposed algorithm identifies and interprets the marshalling signals. Then, the information is converted into control commands that are transmitted to the UAM vehicle.

Performance evaluation was also done not only against two deep learning algorithms but also against those adopting two transfer learning strategies, one for freezing all hidden layers developed from the pre-trained model and the other for training the last hidden layer only among multiple ones, with respect to Mean Squared Error (MSE). We found that the performance of both CNN and LSTM was relatively comparative regardless of dependent variables, discharge and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), whereas the prediction accuracy of both algorithms was slightly higher for discharge than for BOD due to its low variability. When transfer learning which froze all hidden layers of the existing model was applied to two benchmark algorithms, the predictive performance of both algorithms was found to slightly improved only for discharge. Also, there was no measurable variation in the prediction accuracy of benchmark algorithms using the other transfer learning approach.Potential applications of transfer learning include the rapid reuse of the existing models (developed from source domains) for target domains which are hard to develop new prediction models due to the lack of data in deep learning."""

This study developed and evaluated a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based deep learning model that can rapidly and accurately reproduce the spatial distribution analysis results of a physically based model for urban flooding. For the Oncheon-cheon catchment, flood analysis data at a 10-meter spatial resolution were generated using a physically based model for various synthetic rainfall scenarios.

The model was validated using quantitative metrics, including the Hit Rate (HR), False Alarm Ratio (FAR), and Critical Success Index (CSI), by comparing the maximum inundation depth analysis results of the 2014 and 2020 historical flood events to those of the physically based model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of temporal variability in rainfall on the performance of the deep learning model. The maximum inundation depth simulation exhibited high reproducibility, with an HR value of 0.98, an FAR of 0.12, and a CSI of 0.85 for the 2014 event, and an HR value of 0.92, an FAR of 0.19, and a CSI of 0.76 for the 2020 event. The analysis of rainfall window size indicated that the CNN model achieved optimal performance with a 6-hour rainfall window for the 2014 event and a 2-hour window for the 2020 event. Additionally, the deep learning-based model reduced computation time by approximately 98% compared to the sequential calculation of the physically based model and by approximately 90% compared to the parallel calculation, enabling near real-time computation.

With the increase in the use of laminated composites in numerous engineering applications, the insurance of their integrity and performance is of paramount importance. However, owing to the complex nature of these materials, the identification of fracture modes is often a tedious and time-consuming task that requires critical domain knowledge. Therefore, to alleviate these issues, this study aims to utilize modern artificial intelligence technology to automate the fractographic analysis of laminated composites. To accomplish this goal, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of fractured tensile test specimens are obtained from laminated composites to showcase various fracture modes. These SEM images are then categorized based on numerous fracture modes, including fiber breakage, fiber pull-out, mix-mode fracture, matrix brittle fracture, and matrix ductile fracture. Next, the collective data for all classes are divided into train, test, and validation datasets. Two state-of-the-art, deep learning-based pre-trained models, namely, DenseNet and GoogleNet, are trained to learn the discriminative features for each fracture mode. The DenseNet models shows training and testing accuracies of 94.01% and 75.49%, respectively, whereas those of the GoogleNet model are 84.55% and 54.48%, respectively. The trained deep learning models are then validated on unseen validation datasets. This validation demonstrates that the DenseNet model, owing to its deeper architecture, can extract high-quality features, resulting in 84.44% validation accuracy. This value is 36.84% higher than that of the GoogleNet model. Hence, these results affirm that the DenseNet model is effective in performing fractographic analyses of laminated composites by predicting fracture modes with high precision."

This study presents an algorithm for estimating rice planting density in agriculture using drone-captured images and deep learning-based image analysis technology. The algorithm utilizes images collected from various paddies; these images are processed through pre-processing steps and serve as training data for the YOLOv5x deep learning model. The trained model demonstrated high precision and recall, effectively estimating the position information of rice plants in each image. By accurately estimating the position of rice plants based on the central coordinates in diverse unpaved environments, the model allowed for estimation of rice plant density in each paddy, producing values closely aligned with actual measurements. Moreover, the algorithm proposed in this study provides a novel approach for precise determination of rice planting density based on the position information of rice plants in the images.Analysis of drone footage from different regions capturing portions of paddies revealed that the developed algorithm exhibited a significant correlation (R2=0.877) with actual planting density. This finding suggests the potential effective application of the algorithm in real-world agricultural settings.

However, when groundwater monitoring wells are newly developed or when a significant portion of the data is invalid (for example, due to missing values or outliers), acquiring an adequate dataset for training prediction models becomes challenging, leading to diminished prediction accuracy. This study proposes a method based on transfer learning to address the issue of insufficient training data. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) was used as the primary data-driven model for predictions. A GRU-based pretrained network for the transfer learning process was developed using groundwater level and corresponding rainfall data collected from 89 monitoring stations nationwide. Subsequently, this pretrained network was fine-tuned using a small amount of training data obtained from the target monitoring well to develop the final prediction model. To verify the effectiveness of the transfer learning algorithm, two different groundwater level prediction models were evaluated: 1) a GRU-based model trained with insufficient data from the target well, and 2) a GRU-based model utilizing the transfer learning algorithm. Comparative verification was conducted with groundwater level data obtained from wells at two different locations, where the model using the transfer learning algorithm demonstrated superior performance compared to the other. This study confirms that the transfer learning algorithm can significantly enhance the performance of groundwater level prediction models, irrespective of the amount of available training data."

However, the diamond grits attached to the disk cause uneven wear of the pad, leading to the poor uniformity of material removal during CMP. This study investigates the pad wear rate profile according to the swing motion of the conditioner during swing-arm-type CMP conditioning using deep learning. During conditioning, the motion of the swing arm is independently controlled in eight zones of the same pad radius. The experiment includes six swing-motion conditions to obtain actual data on the pad wear rate profile, and deep learning learns the pad wear rate profile obtained in the experiment. The absolute average error rate between the experimental values and learning results is 0.01%. This finding confirms that the experimental results can be well represented by learning. Pad wear rate profile prediction using the learning results reveals good agreement between the predicted and experimental values."

In order to ensure the safe condition of lithium-ion batteries under various driving conditions of electric vehicles, it is necessary to analyze the degradation status and causes of lithium-ion batteries and accurately estimate their state of health (SOH). Therefore, this paper proposes a method for estimating the SOH of lithium-ion batteries using incremental capacity analysis and deep learning. Incremental capacity analysis is a technique that analyzes the electrochemical state inside a lithium-ion battery and can identify the degradation state of the battery. Through this method, parameters related to degradation were extracted, and their usefulness as characteristic parameters for SOH estimation was verified by correlation analysis. The characteristic parameters validated through correlation analysis were used as inputs to deep learning algorithms for SOH estimation to compare the accuracy of SOH estimation by different estimation algorithms."

Therefore, this study uses MPC based on a single rigid body model to derive the optimal ground reaction force. Subsequently, in WBC, constraints are added to satisfy robot dynamics equations and track the optimal ground reaction force. Finally, through WBC, the optimal joint torque is computed considering whole-body floating dynamics and optimal ground reaction forces. All of these computations are performed based on the newly developed deep learning–based state estimator. The proposed control strategy is validated through Gazebo simulation using a quadruped walking robot, Go2."

Clean audio signals and various types of noise were synthesized to create a dataset consisting of clean signals (data1), signals with noise reduction applied (data2), and signals with an additional Wiener filter applied (data3). The dataset was generated at noise levels ranging from SNR 0 dB to 30 dB in 5 dB increments, and each model was trained using these datasets.

Experimental results showed that noise reduction had a positive effect on performance in the SNR 0 dB to 5 dB range, but in environments with SNR levels above 10 dB, noise reduction led to performance degradation. This degradation is likely due to over-suppression of noise in lower-noise environments, which can distort the signal or result in unnecessary signal processing that harms the original signal quality. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of noise reduction in complex noise environments and highlights the need for further research to develop methods that maintain performance in higher SNR environments, particularly above 10 dB."

To solve these problems, it is necessary to determine whether there are foreign materials inside the product, and may tests have been done by means of non-destructive testing methodology such as ultrasound ot X-ray. Nevertheless, there are technical challenges and limitation in acquiring X-ray images and determining the presence of foreign materials. In particular Small-sized or low-density foreign materials may not be visible even when X-ray equipment is used, and noise can also make it difficult to detect foreign objects. Moreover, in order to meet the manufacturing speed requirement, the x-ray acquisition time should be reduced, which can result in the very low signal- to-noise ratio(SNR) lowering the foreign material detection accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a five-step approach to overcome the limitations of low resolution, which make it challenging to detect foreign substances. Firstly, global contrast of X-ray images are increased through histogram stretching methodology. Second, to strengthen the high frequency signal and local contrast, we applied local contrast enhancement technique. Third, to improve the edge clearness, Unsharp masking is applied to enhance edges, making objects more visible. Forth, the super-resolution method of the Residual Dense Block (RDB) is used for noise reduction and image enhancement. Last, the Yolov5 algorithm is employed to train and detect foreign objects after learning.

Facial vitiligo, specifically affecting the face, significantly impacts patients' appear- ance, thereby diminishing their quality of life. Evaluating the efficacy of facial vitiligo treatment typically relies on subjective assessments, such as the Facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI), which can be time-consuming and subjective due to its reliance on clinical observations like lesion shape and distribution. Various machine learning and deep learning methods have been proposed for segmenting vitiligo areas in facial images, showing promising results. However, these methods often struggle to accurately segment vitiligo lesions irregularly distributed across the face. Therefore, our study introduces a framework aimed at improving the segmentation of vitiligo lesions on the face and providing an evaluation of vitiligo lesions. Our framework for facial vitiligo segmentation and lesion evaluation consists of three main steps. Firstly, we perform face detection to minimize background areas and identify the face area of interest using high-quality ultra- violet photographs. Secondly, we extract facial area masks and vitiligo lesion masks using a semantic segmentation net- work-based approach with the generated dataset. Thirdly, we automatically calculate the vitiligo area relative to the facial area. We evaluated the performance of facial and vitiligo lesion segmentation using an independent test dataset that was not included in the training and validation, showing excellent results.

To address these issues, recent studies focus on accurately detecting even small-scale fires using multi-sensor and deeplearning technologies. They also aim at quick fire detection and thermal decomposition using gas. However, these studies are not practical because they overlook the heavy computations involved. Therefore, we propose a fast and accurate fire detection system based onmulti-sensor and deep-learning technologies.

Moreover, the inherent characteristics of budget information often necessitate a broader scope of research, making it difficult to consider context. This study aims to analyze discontinuities in government budget proposals from a project-centric perspective, utilizing unstructured data.We hypothesized that if the project composition in a government budget mirrors its size, a defined causal relationship between budget size changes and project content alterations would exist. To test this, we examined the changes in budget size and project content from 2017 to 2018, using growth rates and a deep learning model for quantification, respectively. Our analysis across programs, fields, sectors, and accounting types revealed that about 80% of changes in budget size align with project composition shifts, while the remaining 20% showed changes in only one dimension.This indicates that the traditional aggregate-focused regression discontinuity approach may not fully capture internal changes, suggesting limitations in context comprehension even when detailed budget information is available."
딥러닝 기반 윤곽정보 추출자를 활용한 RPC 보정 기술 적용성 분석,2024,['RPC'],"대부분의 고해상도 위성영상은 rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) 정보를 제공하여 지상좌표와 영상좌표 간 변환을 수행한다. 그러나 초기 RPC에는 기하학적 오차가 존재하여 ground control points (GCPs)와의 정합을 통해 보정을 수행하여야 한다. GCP chip은 항공정사영상에서 추출한 높이 정보가 포함된 작은 영상 패치(patch)이다. 많은 선행연구에서는 영역 기반 정합 기법을 사용하여 고해상도 위성영상과 GCP chip 간 정합을 수행하였다. 계절적 차이나 변화된 지역이 존재하는 영상에서는 화소값에 의존하는 정합이 어렵기 때문에 윤곽 정보를 추출하여 정합을 수행하기도 한다. 그러나 일반적으로 사용하는 canny 기법으로 정합에 용이한 윤곽을 추출하기 위해서는 위성영상의 분광 특성에 적절한 임계치를 설정해주어야 하는 문제가 존재한다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 위성영상의 지역별 특성에 둔감한 윤곽 정보를 활용하여 RPC 보정을 위한 정합을 수행하고자 한다. 이를 위해 딥러닝 기반 윤곽 정보 추출 네트워크인 pixel difference network (PiDiNet)를 활용하여 위성영상과 GCP chip의 윤곽맵(edge map)을 각각 생성하였다. 그 후 생성된 윤곽맵을 normalized cross-correlation과 relative edge cross-correlation의 입력데이터로 대체하여 영역 기반의 정합을 수행하였다. 마지막으로 RPC 보정에 필요한 변환모델 계수를 도출하기 위하여 data snooping 기법을 반복적으로 적용하여 참정합쌍을 추출하였다. 오정합쌍을 제거한 참정합쌍에 대해 root mean square error (RMSE)를 도출하고 기존에 사용하던 상관관계 기법과 결과를 정성적으로 비교하였다. 실험 결과, PiDiNet은 약 0.3~0.9 화소의 RMSE 값 분포를 보였으나 canny 기법에 비해 두꺼운 윤곽을 나타내어 일부 영상에서 미세하게 정확도가 저하되는 것을 확인하였다. 그러나 위성영상 내 특징적인 윤곽을 일관적으로 나타냄으로써 정합이 어려운 지역에서도 정합이 잘 수행되는 것을 확인하였다. 본 연구를 통해 윤곽 기반 정합 기법의 강인성을 개선하여 다양한 지역에서의 정합을 수행할 수 있을 것으로 예상된다.","Most very high-resolution (VHR) satellite images provide rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) data to facilitate the transformation between ground coordinates and image coordinates. However, initial RPC often contains geometric errors, necessitating correction through matching with ground control points (GCPs). A GCP chip is a small image patch extracted from an orthorectified image together with height information of the center point, which can be directly used for geometric correction. Many studies have focused on area-based matching methods to accurately align GCP chips with VHR satellite images. In cases with seasonal differences or changed areas, edge-based algorithms are often used for matching due to the difficulty of relying solely on pixel values. However, traditional edge extraction algorithms,such as canny edge detectors, require appropriate threshold settings tailored to the spectral characteristics of satellite images. Therefore, this study utilizes deep learning-based edge information that is insensitive to the regional characteristics of satellite images for matching. Specifically,we use a pretrained pixel difference network (PiDiNet) to generate the edge maps for both satellite images and GCP chips. These edge maps are then used as input for normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and relative edge cross-correlation (RECC) to identify the peak points with the highest correlation between the two edge maps. To remove mismatched pairs and thus obtain the bias-compensated RPC, we iteratively apply the data snooping. Finally, we compare the results qualitatively and quantitatively with those obtained from traditional NCC and RECC methods. The PiDiNet network approach achieved high matching accuracy with root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 pixels. However, the PiDiNet-generated edges were thicker compared to those from the canny method, leading to slightly lower registration accuracy in some images. Nevertheless, PiDiNet consistently produced characteristic edge information, allowing for successful matching even in challenging regions. This study demonstrates that improving the robustness of edge-based registration methods can facilitate effective registration across diverse regions."

This study aimed to determine if thermal imaging could be used in a deep learning model to recognize oriental melon grown in a hydroponic system. To recognize oriental melon using thermal imaging, time-series thermal imaging was performed under sunny and cloudy weather conditions. Temperatures of oriental melon and canopy were extracted from thermal images. Differences between extracted temperatures according to weather conditions were then determined. It was found that thermal images acquired after 14:00 were suitable for stable recognition of oriental melon regardless of weather conditions. Based on this result, additional thermal images were acquired to train YOLO v5 and Faster R-CNN models. Acquired thermal images were trained with original and augmented data. Recognition performances of training models were compared with the best mAP (mean Average Precision). As a result, it was confirmed that both YOLO v5 and Faster R-CNN models achieved the best mAP@0.5 of 92% or more regardless of data augmentation. Data augmentation did not significantly affect the accuracy of either model. This might be because thermal images used to train models were acquired under restrictive conditions in a hydroponic greenhouse, which affected model generalization. Therefore, additional experiments under various conditions are necessary to improve generalization of the model in the future."

Enhancing not just the inherent model performance but also accounting for model characteristics and preprocessing data are crucial elements for precise dam inflow prediction. Particularly, existing rainfall data, derived from snowfall amounts through heating facilities, introduces distortions in the correlation between snow accumulation and rainfall, especially in dam basins influenced by snow accumulation, such as Soyang Dam. This study focuses on the preprocessing of rainfall data essential for the application of ML&DL models in predicting dam inflow in basins affected by snow accumulation. This is vital to address phenomena like reduced outflow during winter due to low snowfall and increased outflow during spring despite minimal or no rain, both of which are physical occurrences. Three machine learning models (SVM, RF, LGBM) and two deep learning models (LSTM, TCN) were built by combining rainfall and inflow series. With optimal hyperparameter tuning, the appropriate model was selected, resulting in a high level of predictive performance with NSE ranging from 0.842 to 0.894. Moreover, to generate rainfall correction data considering snow accumulation, a simulated snow accumulation algorithm was developed. Applying this correction to machine learning and deep learning models yielded NSE values ranging from 0.841 to 0.896, indicating a similarly high level of predictive performance compared to the pre-snow accumulation application. Notably, during the snow accumulation period, adjusting rainfall during the training phase was observed to lead to a more accurate simulation of observed inflow when predicted. This underscores the importance of thoughtful data preprocessing, taking into account physical factors such as snowfall and snowmelt, in constructing data models."

However, interpreting predictions from deep learning models poses challenges, especially in finance where result interpretation is important. This study aims to determine the uncertainty of stable deep learning models, despite changes in the model like dropout, to establish standards for reliable models and identify those detecting anomal data through model uncertainty. In the experiment, the traditional statistical model ARIMA and deep learning models mainly used for time series analysis, CNN, LSTM, MLP, and CNN-LSTM. Uncertainty was measured from a Bayesian perspective using MC Dropout. The experimental results confirmed that deep learning models performed better than statistical models for various patterns of time series data. It was observed that, even if the performance was not the best, LSTM based models exhibited low uncertainty, indicating stability.

An algorithm utilizing GAP and Pearson correlation coefficient was employed to construct the model, and the accuracy of similarity was analyzed by comparing the total number of similar images derived at 1st (Top1), 3rd (Top3), and 5th (Top5) ranks with the original images. The image data used for the DRG model consisted of a total of 278 works from the Le Festival International des Jardins de Chaumont-sur-Loire, 27 works from the Seoul International Garden Show, and 17 works from the Korea Garden Show. Image analysis was conducted using the DRG model for both the same group and different groups, resulting in the establishment of guidelines for assessing show garden similarity. First, overall image similarity analysis was best suited for applying data augmentation techniques based on the ResNet50 model. Second, for image analysis focusing on internal structure and outer form, it was effective to apply a certain size filter (16cm × 16cm) to generate images emphasizing form and then compare similarity using the VGG-16 model. It was suggested that an image size of 448 × 448 pixels and the original image in full color are the optimal settings.

Various deep learning models have been developed to help TOF-MRA reading in the field. The performance of those TOF-MRA analysis tools, however, faces several limitations in cerebral aneurysm detection. These challenges primarily come from the fact that cerebral aneurysms occupy less than 0.1% of the total TOF-MRA voxel size. This study aims to improve the efficiency of cerebral aneurysm detection by developing a landmark-based semi-supervised deep learning method, a technology that automatically generates landmark boxes in areas with a high probability of cerebral aneurysm occurrence.Methods: We used data from a total of 500 aneurysm-positive and 50 aneurysm-negative subjects. The aneurysm detection model was developed using clustering and a dilated residual network.Results: When the number of landmarks was ten and their size was 36 mm3, the best performance was achieved in our experiment. Although landmark occupies a small portion of the entire image, up to 98.2% of landmarks were cerebral aneurysms. The sensitivity of the model for cerebral aneurysm detection was 83.0%, with a false positive rate of 3.4%.Conclusions: This study developed a deep learning model using TOF-MRA image. This model generates the most suitable landmarks for each individual, excluding unnecessary areas for cerebral aneurysm detection, which makes it possible to focus on areas with a high probability of occurrence.

The purpose of this study is to measure and visualize the fear of crime felt by citizens using street view images and deep learning technology, and the study area is Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul. In order to measure fear of crime using street view images, it is necessary to measure people’s fear of crime on street images and build a model to predict the evaluation score using a deep learning model. For this study, we collected street view images using Kakao Map API. Using 20,886 street view images from the collected images, we built a training data set of 171,942 images that ask users to respond to which street they feel relatively unsafe. After training the Global-Patch-RSS-CNN model with the constructed pairwise comparison data set, the trained model was applied to the entire study area to derive and visualize the prediction score of fear of crime.

A virtual environment modeled after the underground utility tunnel located in Ochang, Chungcheongbuk-do is constructed to collect fire data using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) software. In the experiment, we compared the proposed model to other time-series anomaly detection models and evalutated its predictive performance. The results show that the precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score of ConvLSTM-VAE are 0.881579, 0.99505, 0.930693, and 0.934884, respectively, and far superior to other models in terms of its predictive performance."

Image classification models commonly used to diagnose crop diseases are highly accurate but costly to train and require high-performance equipment. Since devices utilized in the agricultural field are limited in terms of memory and power, efficient deep learning models are needed. Therefore, in this paper, we studied a lightweight model for disease diagnosis in crops. We implemented a disease diagnosis model for crops using tangerine fruit and leaf images. The performance of the implemented models was compared through accuracy versus FLOPs, and MobileNet V3 Small was the best among the lightweight models. We further applied data balancing and performance enhancement techniques. When data balancing was performed, the average accuracy of the model decreased, but the classes were more evenly classified. As for the performance improvement, the Label smoothing technique improved the accuracy by 1.2%. Therefore, it is recommended that the citrus pest diagnosis model for mobile devices should be preprocessed with data balancing and smoothing techniques and implemented using the MobileNet V3 Small model for optimal user experience and accuracy."

This increases the difficulty for farmers, middlemen, and sellers to understand agricultural prices and make optimal production and sales decisions. To prevent economic losses for farmers and price risks for consumers due to price forecasting failures, governments are trying to stabilize the supply and price of agricultural products. However, difficulties exist in the process of analyzing and predicting prices through economic models. Therefore, this study develops a model for predicting agricultural prices by securing data required for agricultural observations and identifying economic requirements that can reflect changes in private agricultural distribution conditions. In addition, we propose specific strategies on how to utilize the developed prediction model. This study contributes to the expansion of the literature by developing a prediction model for agricultural commodity prices based on various economic variables. In addition, the agricultural commodity price prediction model based on economic variables can be used by various stakeholders in the agricultural commodity distribution process to contribute to market stabilization."

Patients diagnosed with circadian sleep disorders, narcolepsy, or periodic limb movement disorders were excluded. From the actigraphy data, three types of data were selected from the first 5 days, namely, sleep-wake status, activity count, and light exposure per epoch. The data were processed into a two-dimensional array with four instances, namely, 24-hour full-day data and data for 6, 8, and 10 hours timepoints after sleep onset, and then analyzed. Using a CNN, we attempted to classify the processed data into PSG-based diagnoses.Results: Overfitting of the training data was observed. The CNN showed near-perfect accuracy on the test data, but failed to classify the validation data (area under the curve: 24-hour full-day data: 0.6031, 6 hours after sleep onset: 0.5148, 8 hours: 0.6122, and 10 hours: 0.5769).Conclusions: The lack and inaccuracy of data were responsible for the results. A higher sampling rate and additional ancillary data, such as PSG or heart rate variability data, are necessary for accurate classification. Additionally, alternative approaches to machine learning, such as transformers, should be considered in future studies."

Summarizes the latest trends in facial recognition technology regulation.Moves to regulate facial recognition technology have accelerated in Europe and the United States in recent years. In particular, the United States, which has major IT companies, is a world leader in facial recognition technology research and development, and research on the impact of facial recognition technology on society has been conducted from a relatively early stage. These research reports have raised concerns that the facial recognition system may become a surveillance society and strengthen structural discrimination, and human rights protection groups have targeted private companies developing facial recognition technology and public institutions that have adopted this technology to use facial recognition. We are actively campaigning to ban it. Looking at the ordinance enactment process enacted in various places from 2019 to 2020, there are several effects of this movement. Additionally, efforts to enact legislation regulating facial recognition technology have been rapidly expanding following the May 2020 death of George Floyd, an African-American man who died after a white police officer squeezed his neck.While interest in regulating facial recognition technology is growing in Europe and the United States, the situation in our country is difficult to formulate government guidelines for some use cases (e.g., guidebook on handling personal data of One ID service using facial recognition technology at airports). It is undeniable that it is limited and that each country is ‘lagging behind’. According to a report by the AI ​​Now Institute, a research institute at New York University, “Recent laws address traditional data privacy and security issues and how these systems are used. Liability issues, such as who is responsible if these systems are compromised, are being addressed and the focus is shifting from data to systems.” In other words, when considering the laws and regulations of facial recognition technology, it is important to have a comprehensive view of the entire system.In keeping with the development of science and technology, the question of who will form rules, how, and through what discussions, is not limited to facial recognition technology. For example, with regard to nanomaterials, it is said that sufficient scientific knowledge is not available regarding their effects on the environment and the human body, but preventive measures are being taken mainly in Europe and the United States. According to traditional constitutional theory, restricting individual rights and freedoms requires a basis of law, and law requires social, economic, political, and scientific facts to support its necessity and rationality. However, if we wait until the risks of cutting-edge technology, which involve scientific uncertainty, are clarified before taking action, the damage and harm could far exceed expectations, and the country, which must protect the lives and rights of its citizens, cannot respond in such a way. In these cases, when the precautionary principle is applied, emphasizing the preventive aspect, the state must ensure that no harm or incident has occurred in a sufficiently tangible way to justify the need for regulation of the technology, or that there is scientific knowledge and social consensus to justify regulation. In a situation where we cannot obtain it, we must legislate and make policy decisions."

The trained model showed relativelylow performance with an F-1 score of 0.61 for training data and 0.31 for test data.The model’s low performance is thought to be due to insufficient training causedby the large number of classification categories (34) and data imbalance betweencategories. Although the model performance using self-learning data was low, itis believed that model performance can be improved by grouping classificationcategories according to research purposes or resolving data imbalance through dataaugmentation techniques.

Therefore, it is necessary to consider suitable ripeness for consumption and distribution. However, research on ripeness judgments for peaches in the orchard is scarce. This study used deep learning technology to develop a ripeness classification model for ‘Mihwang’ peaches. A dataset was prepared using 2,800 images, each taken from a peach orchard (outside dataset) and a laboratory (inside dataset) with the same fruit. The dataset was constructed based on the harvest date of the peaches and the peach apex’s skin color (a* value). It uses three classes, immature, ripe, and overripe, according to the classification criteria of the two datasets. The model was trained with a ratio of 7:2:1 of training data, validation data, and test data, and image data augmentation was carried out to improve the diversity of the data and to solve any imbalances.Among EfficientNet, YOLOv5, and Vision Transformer, the deep learning model recorded the best classification model performance on EfficientNet. Based on the classification model and performance evaluation index, the harvest-date-based classification model achieved the highest accuracy of 100%. The classification model based on the apex color a* value of peaches showed high accuracy with a minimum rate of 94.7% and a maximum rate of 98.2%. The peach ripeness classification model developed in this study can be used for determining the proper time for the mechanical harvesting of fruit from an orchard."

This implies that financial institutions can more accurately predict loan delinquency rates and manage risks effectively. The LSTM model's application confirmed higher predictive power than traditional statistical approaches. Consumer price index, consumer composite sentiment index, bank loan balances, and household loan interest rates were key factors for household delinquency rates, while producer price index, bank loan balances, and corporate loan interest rates were significant for corporate delinquency rates.

However, in addition to the target's echo, the active sonar's received signal is mixed with seafloor, sea surface reverberation, biological noise, and other noise, making target recognition difficult. Conventional techniques for detecting signals above a threshold not only cause false detections or miss targets depending on the set threshold, but also have the problem of having to set an appropriate threshold for various underwater environments. To overcome this, research has been conducted on automatic calculation of threshold values through techniques such as Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) and application of advanced tracking filters and association techniques, but there are limitations in environments where a significant number of detections occur. As deep learning technology has recently developed, efforts have been made to apply it in the field of underwater target detection, but it is very difficult to acquire active sonar data for discriminator learning, so not only is the data rare, but there are only a very small number of targets and a relatively large number of non-targets. There are difficulties due to the imbalance of data. In this paper, the image of the energy distribution of the detection signal is used, and a classifier is learned in a way that takes into account the imbalance of the data to distinguish between targets and non-targets and added to the existing technique. Through the proposed technique, target misclassification was minimized and non-targets were eliminated, making target recognition easier for active sonar operators. And the effectiveness of the proposed technique was verified through sea experiment data obtained in the East Sea."

However, collisions between ships and these aids result in substantial costs for buoy damage and repair. While high-end equipment is currently used to prevent such accidents, its widespread adoption is hindered by cost concerns. This paper presents research on a maritime object detection algorithm utilizing embedded systems to address this issue. Previous studies employed the Hough transform for horizon detection, but its high computational demands posed challenges for real-time processing. To overcome this limitation, our approach first performs image segmentation, followed by an optimized Otsu algorithm for horizon detection. Subsequently, we establish a Region of Interest (ROI) based on the detected horizon, focusing on areas with a high risk of ship collision. Within this ROI, particularly below the horizon line, maritime objects are detected. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is then applied to determine whether the detected objects are ships. Objects classified as ships within the ROI are considered potential collision risks."

As a result of detecting objects through the YOLO algorithm, buildings showed a performance of detecting objects corresponding to 96.3% of the buildings provided in the existing digital map. In addition, the YOLO algorithm developed in this study detected 136 additional buildings that were not located in the digital map. Plastic greenhouses detected a total of 297 objects, but the detection rate was low for some plastic greenhouses for fruit trees. Also, agricultural land had the lowest detection rate. This result is because agricultural land has a larger area and irregular shape than buildings, so the accuracy is lower than buildings due to the inconsistency of training data. Therefore, segmentation detection, rather than box-shaped detection, is likely to be more effective for agricultural fields. Comparing the detected objects with the land category by law, it was analyzed that some buildings exist in agricultural and forest areas where it is difficult to locate buildings. It seems that it is necessary to link with administrative information to understand that these buildings are used illegally. Therefore, at the current level, it is possible to objectively determine the existence of buildings in fields where it is difficult to locate buildings."

Business Japanese requires not only proficiency in the Japanese language but also a systematic understanding of honorific expressions. Recognizing that active learning alone is insufficient, we implemented deep active learning that focuses on the depth of learning. The course aims to help students acquire the linguistic forms of honorific expressions and develop the ability to select appropriate honorific expressions depending on the context (e.g., the person, the setting, and the content of the conversation). The class was designed to follow six steps: (1) motivation, (2) orientation, (3) internalization, (4) externalization, (5) critique, and (6) control. At the end of the semester, a post-class survey was conducted to assess whether the participants had achieved deep learning. The result clearly indicates that the participants were deeply involved in their learning and had adopted a deep approach. These findings suggest that the participants were engaged in deep active learning. On the other hand, it also became clear that deep learning does not automatically occur just by conducting lessons in which participants feel their ‘minds were actively engaged.’ Furthermore, correlation coefficients between the responses to each question in the questionnaire were analyzed. The result of study shows that activities promoting holistic learning and efforts to create a positive classroom atmosphere foster deep learning in students. The study also suggests that classes helping participants discover the patterns and principles of honorific expressions can enhance student satisfaction."

The study defines a three-dimensional simulation space with ground-based unmanned weapon systems, bombs, and destinations that must be reached while avoiding drone bombing attacks. Deep reinforcement learning was applied along with a progressive goal increase method to enhance learning effectiveness. The study evaluates the performance of the deep reinforcement learning evasive maneuvering model and the effectiveness of the progressive goal increase method. Results showed that an unmanned weapon system successfully reached its destination with an 81.3% probability of avoiding bombing attacks. Without the progressive goal increase method, rewards from learning were lower, and systems often failed to reach their destinations, verifying the method's effectiveness. The proposed method can enhance the survivability of ground-based unmanned weapon systems."

At first, for inferring the position of the object, pre-collected raw images and the exact position of the object are used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Position Extractor, which is based on the feature extraction part of pre-trained VGG16. Then, reinforcement learning methods such as Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) along with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) are used to train a robot arm to move the object to a desired position in the simulation environment. A big advantage of this methodology is that an extra sensor for tracking the exact position of the object in real-time is not needed, since raw images are used to infer the position of the object and the robot arm uses that inferred position to move the object to the desired location. The mean cumulative rewards and the success rate of the methodology proposed by this paper are –48.51 and 95.0% respectively. The results obtained by this method show that it is possible to move an object from a certain position to a desired one by a trained robot arm using the object positions inferred from raw images, instead of using the actual positions of the object."

In the food manufacturing industry, maintaining and improving product quality continuously is crucial. However, quality management faces numerous challenges owing to the complex manufacturing processes and variables such as diverse raw materials and environmental conditions. Traditional quality management methods have limitations because they mainly rely on empirical data and are often restricted to analyzing quality conditions at specific points in time, making it difficult to predict or prevent issues in real time. To address these limitations, this study introduces a quality analysis and prediction system based on a generative model and reinforcement learning. The system generates quality-related data using the generative model, and employs the reinforcement learning model to analyze in real time the variety of data generated about quality during the manufacturing process. By inputting data collected in real time into a reinforcement learning model, the system can predict the final quality of the product. Moreover, by learning the impact on quality from changes in specific variables, the system can identify and prevent potential defects before they occur.

The AI-assisted study room employs convoluted neural network (CNN) deep learning techniques based on AI technology to monitor head and gaze movements, and utilizes real-time electroencephalogram(EEG) measurements to assess concentration levels. The research sample comprised 45 students in the experimental group and 45 students in the control group, selected using propensity score matching with the SPSS 28.0 program. The experimental group used the AI-assisted study room for 70 minutes, twice a week over six weeks, and participated in pre-tests, post-tests, and follow-up tests. The control group took the same three tests at corresponding intervals. Homogeneity tests and repeated measures ANOVA were conducted. Based on the post-test results, in-depth interviews were held with six students to analyze their experiences with the AI-assisted study room. The findings are as follows: First, repeated measures ANOVA for self-regulated learning revealed no significant differences between the experimental and control groups affirming the effectiveness of the AI-assisted study room. Second, interview results indicated that students with increased self-regulated learning indices in the experimental group generally reported positive experiences and perceptions with the AI assisted study room, stating that it helped maintain their learning motivation. In contrast, students in the no change and decrease groups reported that the discomfort caused by wearing concentration measurement devices hindered their learning concentration.Educational Impact and Implications : This study holds important educational implications as it empirically examined the potential of AI-assited learning environments to enhance self-regulated learning. For AI-based learning environments to be established in schools and to ensure their positive impact on learners, they need to be designed and implemented in a learner-friendly manner and accompanied by learner-tailored educational support."

Our study addresses this challenge by proposing an on-device AI-based real-time machine fault diagnosis system that utilizes continual learning. Our proposed system includes a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a continual learning algorithm, and a real-time monitoring service. First, we developed a lightweight 1D CNN model to reduce the cost of model deployment and enable real-time inference on the target edge device with limited computing resources. We then compared the performance of five continual learning algorithms with three public bearing fault datasets and selected the most effective algorithm for our system. Finally, we implemented a real-time monitoring service using an open-source data visualization framework. In the performance comparison results between continual learning algorithms, we found that the replay-based algorithms outperformed the regularization-based algorithms, and the experience replay (ER) algorithm had the best diagnostic accuracy. We further tuned the number and length of data samples used for a memory buffer of the ER algorithm to maximize its performance. We confirmed that the performance of the ER algorithm becomes higher when a longer data length is used. Consequently, the proposed system showed an accuracy of 98.7%, while only 16.5% of the previous data was stored in memory buffer. Our lightweight CNN model was also able to diagnose a fault type of one data sample within 3.76 ms on the Raspberry Pi 4B device."

점진적 전이학습을 활용한 음성 데이터 적응   감정 인식 모델,2024,"['Progressive Transfer Learning', 'Speech Data Adaptation', 'Speech Emotion Recognition', 'Deep Learning']",,"Due to the increase in remote communication caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of emotion recognition in education and psychological counseling has becoming more prominent. Accordingly, multimodal approaches have recently received attention, and research on emotion recognition using these approaches is actively underway. The multimodal approach uses ensemble techniques that average or weight model predictions to predict the final result. However, if one modality shows relatively low performance, it can limit the performance of the entire model. Therefore, to improve the performance of multimodal emotion recognition, it is necessary to enhance the performance of individual modalities. In this paper, we propose a speech data adaptive emotion recognition model using progressive transfer learning by applying domain adaptation techniques. After initially training the designed deep learning model with text data, the fixed weights are progressively reduced and retrained with voice data to effectively combine the characteristics of text and voice for speech emotion recognition. Experimental results confirm that this approach achieves higher performance than models trained solely on voice data and models using general transfer learning. This methodology is expected to contribute to improving multimodal emotion recognition performance and enhancing interaction in non-face-to-face environments."

This process of standardizing and combining rewards can be tricky though, as we might lose the unique aspects of each reward function  and struggle to figure out the right weights for each one. We tackle this challenge by proposing a new way to handle multiple rewards in reinforcement learning: instead of mixing everything together, we let the system learn about different types of rewards separately. Our approach uses what we call a Multi Critic network structure in Actor-Critic algorithms, where multiple Critic networks each focus on learning about different reward elements. This setup allows the Actor network policy to be evaluated from multiple angles. To validate our idea, we applied it to recommender systems, which naturally need to balance various types of rewards. We treated the recommendation process as a sequential decision-makings and used DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) to handle the large action space typical in recommendation problems. As results, we show that Multi Critic model with multiple learning passes performed better than both traditional Single Critic models and other recommendation systems."

Traditionally, essay-type evaluations have been employed in university admissions and occasional performance assessments, and the current discourse extends their application to the College Scholastic Ability Test.Therefore, despite concerns about the fairness and reliability of essay-type assessments, prior research indicates that the learning experiences induced by these assessments help develop higher-order problem-solving skills required in today’s society. However, because essay-type assessments are not a necessary or sufficient condition for in-depth learning, it is essential to examine the characteristics of essay-type assessments that lead to in-depth learning.This study aims to explore the backgrounds and characteristics of these assessments, and its significance lies in exploring methods to ensure that the introduction of essay-type assessments is not merely a change in assessment type but a means to induce corresponding in-depth learning experiences. Although this study has the limitation of being unable to develop detailed discussions through extensive literature analysis, it aims to highlight the significance of essay-type assessments from a foundational perspective as its introductory discussions spread. We hope that this study will serve as a basis for the establishment and operation of essay-type assessments"

The Joseon dynasty was founded in 1392 with the Neo-Confucian ideals and doctrines as the state ideology. In particular, Zhu Xi’s Neo-Confucianism remained a central subject of scholarly inquiry and practice for Joseon scholars until the end of the dynasty. By the 17th century, the understanding of Zhu Xi’s Neo-Confucianism had deepened. Within this context, the Great Learning became a fundamental text for scholarly inquiry, and especially the system of Commentaries on the Daxue (Daxue Zhangju, 大學章句) edited by Zhu Xi became a significant area of research. However, existing research tended to focus on interpretations by specific figures like Jeong Yak-yong and Jeong Je-du, who deviated from Zhu Xi’s views. This approach suggests that the scholarship of 18th century Joseon attempted to overcome Zhu Xi’s teachings and explore new academic frontiers. While such a perspective is crucial for understanding the 18th century, it alone does not fully capture the richness of Joseon’s scholarly landscape at the time.The interpretation of the Great Learning in 18th century Joseon needs to encompass not only the previously focused areas such as “practical learning”, “Yangmingism”, and “disciplines of kingship” but also include the broader context of Zhu Xi’s Neo-Confucianism. This paper will examine five key questions: What sources were consulted? How were the discussions framed? What themes were addressed? Where were the theories applied? What are the distinctive features of Joseon scholars’ interpretations in East Asia? It will characterize the 18th-century Joseon interpretation of the Great Learning through emerging scholarly perspectives, diversification with regard to the trend of writings, enrichment of textual debates, and the appearance of related works like Lectures on Classics and History (經史講議) and ultimately, compare these aspects in the context of East Asia. This period was the pinnacle of Neo-Confucianism in Joseon, a time when deep philosophical insights emerged, which also marked the beginning of new ideological movements.Through this research, the scholarly interests and achievements of Joseon scholars regarding the Great Learning will be objectively assessed to establish a foundation for the history of Joseon scholarship, and ultimately, to position the scholarship of 18th century Joseon within the history of East Asian thoughts. It is hoped that this exploration and proposal will contribute significantly to clarifying the true landscape of Korea’s scholarly history."

The modeling results revealed an improvement in the performance of the model when adjusting the final layer. Using transfer learning and then adjusting layers close to the output layer, small image data-related accuracy issues can be reduced and generated images can be classified."

First of all, RGB image data of chestnuts treated using 51 two-knife peeling process conditions were acquired. The developed model was constructed with two stages of K-means clustering and ranking systems. The Jaccard similarity index for a performance evaluation of the models was calculated. The first clustering stage was a process of separating the chestnut and background from the original image. The average Jaccard similarity index of the first clustering step was 0.92. The second clustering step was the division process of the peeled chestnut into three regions (outer shell, inner shell, and kernel). The percentage of each region was derived by dividing the number of pixels in each region by the total number of pixels in the image. The Jaccard similarity indices of the outer shell, inner shell, and kernel were 0.96, 0.88, and 0.74, respectively. As a result, machine learning-based clustering with a ranking system was proposed to analyze whether the peeling rate affects the improvement of the peel efficiency and production efficiency in the domestic chestnut industry."

The existing bot detection methods are mostly in-game behavioral analysis and rule-based systems. However, these methods has a limitation because game bots are constantly changing to mimic the game behavior of normal users.

Based on the idea that the objective of behaviors of game bots is gaining in-game goods, their cash flow patterns and item transaction patterns does not change. Therefore, we suggest to use the variables that are related to abnormal item transactions and cash flow patterns.

Traditionally, collaborative filtering has been widely used as a methodology to implement recommendation systems, and more recently, reinforcement learning techniques have been frequently attempted. However, existing approaches based on collaborative filtering or deep reinforcement learning have limitations in accurately reflecting the complexity of user behavior and multidimensional preferences, resulting in reduced recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel travel recommendation system that combines relational graph networks with reinforcement learning. Specifically, the study models the complex interactions between users and destinations as a graph structure, and by inputting high-dimensional embeddings generated from the Relational Graph Attention Network (RGAT) into the reinforcement learning algorithm APEX-DQN, it recommends optimal travel destinations. The proposed system demonstrates a superior ability to capture complex user behavior patterns and unstructured data, which traditional models struggle to process effectively. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing CF (User-based), CF (POI-based), GMF, MLP, and GAT models in terms of RMSE and MAE metrics. Notably, the integration of RGAT and Apex-DQN enables the model to more precisely learn and adapt to intricate user behavior patterns, thereby effectively reflecting real-time changes in user preferences and delivering highly personalized recommendations."

With the advent of deep learning, many new and effective methods have been proposed. However, most SR methods are conducted under the assumption that the low-resolution degradation process is bicubic downsampling, so there is a problem that they are not well applied to real images with complex degradation types. In this work, we propose a method to improve the performance of Single Image Super-Resolution that is robust against various degradation types, without changing the architecture of conventional SR network, by utilizing the internal information. For utilizing the internal information, we adopt a meta-learning algorithms using a meta-learner network, which constructs an pixel-wise adaptive weight map(PAW) tailored to the given input image. This approach can be quickly applied to bicubic downsampling kernels as well as blind downsampling kernels and improves performance by encouraging the network to focus more on complex parts of the image. Experiments on various benchmark SR datasets show that our proposed method improves the performance while maintaining the structure of the existing SR network."

Accurate and reliable cancer diagnosis is a prerequisite for timely management and treatment. In this study, we propose a deep learning method that can conduct colorectal cancer diagnosis on whole slide images obtained from colorectal cancer patients. Previous research on cancer grading primarily focused on categorical classification, which assumes the independence among cancer grades. However, cancer grades indicate how different or close the cancer cells are to normal cells. That is, cancer grades are related to each other. Herein, we propose to define the ordinal relationship among cancer grades and use them to conduct cancer diagnosis. To achieve this, we construct a convolutional neural network that can simultaneously perform both categorical and ordinal classification. The ordinal classification utilizes a pair of an input image and a reference image. Moreover, we introduce a voting mechanism to improve the classification performance. The voting mechanism identifies the input image that is likely to be mis-classified and corrects the classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only accurately conducts cancer grading but also outperforms other competing models.

It aims to closely analyze how the participants cooperate with each other to achieve a common goal, that is, the expression intended by the piece, and enhance the perfection of the performance, and how they adjust the aspects of their own expressions and demonstrate their expertise in the process of this interaction. To this end, the process of rehearsal, rehearsal, and actual performance of an opera performance was recorded, observed, and analyzed through video recording, and the flow of multimodal interaction, including verbal and nonverbal, was analyzed from the perspective of ‘the learning sciences’. ‘The learning sciences’ refers to all studies on the interaction and variation of experience among participants. For the learning sciences analysis, we utilized Ethnomethodology (EM), an embodied phenomenology and micro-sociology of contextual inference and action. EM is a genre of qualitative research that attempts to approach the embodied mind and its expression style through how the interaction between participants works in conjunction with the situational context. Since performance can be seen as an inherent characteristic of one-timeness and on-siteness, we attempted to explore the possibility of this as a research method that systematically analyzes these characteristics of performance. Beyond the text of the piece, I believe it will deepen the insight into the harmonious integration based on creative performance and interaction that is generated in the performance execution. I hope that it will contribute to not only a deep understanding of performance but also an expanded understanding of interaction and participatory practice in a wide range of genres beyond the arts."

The hydrodynamic model for the downstream reach of the Han River was calibrated by considering the spatial distribution and temporal variation of Manning’s roughness coefficient in unsteady flow conditions. In the following error correction procedure, the systematic errors of the hydrodynamic model were captured using long short term memory (LSTM) model. To assess the model accuracy, performances of the hydrodynamic model, two LSTM based models (LSTM1 and LSTM2), and the hybrid model were compared. Regarding inputs, LSTM1 considers the historical observations only, and LSTM2 considers not only the historical observations that used in LSTM1 but also the prescribed boundary conditions required for the hydrodynamic forecast model. The root-mean-square errors were used for the evaluation of model performance. The hybrid model significantly improved the forecasting accuracy of flood water levels compared to individual models, which indicates that the hybrid model is able to take advantage of complementary strengths of both the hydrodynamic model and the LSTM model. The LSTM-based hybrid model also outperformed the hybrid model based on artificial neural network, resulting in less than 10 cm of root-mean-square error for 3-hour lead time forecasting of the flood water level."

In order to minimize the damage caused by hypoxia in aquaculture, it is necessary to build a prediction model that can predict the timing of hypoxia in advance and respond to it early. In this study, recurrent neural network models specialized in time series prediction, Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit(GRU), and 1-Dimensional Convolution Neural Network(1D-CNN), a convolutional neural network, were used to predict the variation of bottom dissolved oxygen, and the performance of each model was evaluated. The input data for the deep learning models were layer by layer marine environmental data continuously observed in the Dangdong bay from 2019 to 2022. The 2019 to 2021 data were used as training and validation data for the model, and the 2022 data were predicted and compared and validated with the observed data. Pearson correlation and mutual information(MI) analyses, trial and error methods were performed to select the optimal inputs and parameters that affect the prediction accuracy of the model. The results showed that the GRU model and 1D-CNN model outperformed the LSTM model. The reproducibility of the short-term variation pattern of the LSTM model decreased as the forecast lead time increased, which was attributed to the structure of each model. This study shows that when applying deep learning models to time series forecasting, it is necessary to use models that reflect data characteristics. In the future, if the prediction error of the model is reduced by securing reliable and high-quality inputs and adjusting the parameters, it is expected that improved prediction accuracy and a prediction time of more than 48 hours can be secured."

In The House with a Deep Yard, the mother figure appears as a test for the boy to learn the discipline of the “symbolic father.” This mother figure, regardless of whether it is the boy’s biological mother, a neighbor, or a family member, represents an extended mother figure who exemplifies the world in which the ideology of the time operates and provides survival instructions as a patriarch. Therefore, it is appropriate to interpret The House with a Deep Yard as a narrative of “becoming the kind of child the mother patriarch wants.” Focusing on the mythological master plot reread from a female gendered perspective, this study attempts to analyses the works based on the foundation of the ‘mother representation-centred Korean war period master plot.’ The analysis of Kim Won-il’s The House with a Deep Yard shows that the criteria of this ‘masterplot’ can be applied to narratives that go beyond the category of female protagonists or female authors."

Measuring the number of apples on anapple tree can be used to predict apple yield and to assess losses for determining agricultural disaster insurancepayouts. To measure apple fruit load, we photographed the front and back sides of apple trees. We manuallylabeled the apples in the captured images to construct a dataset, which was then used to train a one-stage objectdetection CNN model. However, when apples on an apple tree are obscured by leaves, branches, or other parts ofthe tree, they may not be captured in images. Consequently, it becomes difficult for image recognition-based deeplearning models to detect or infer the presence of these apples. To address this issue, we propose a two-stageinference process. In the first stage, we utilize an image-based deep learning model to count the number of applesin photos taken from both sides of the apple tree. In the second stage, we conduct a polynomial regression analysis,using the total apple count from the deep learning model as the independent variable, and the actual number ofapples manually counted during an on-site visit to the orchard as the dependent variable. The performanceevaluation of the two-stage inference system proposed in this paper showed an average accuracy of 90.98% incounting the number of apples on each apple tree. Therefore, the proposed method can significantly reduce thetime and cost associated with manually counting apples.

In particular, the long short term memory-multiple layer perceptron (LSTM-MLP) technique shows superior performance to the existing deep natural network (DNN) based channel estimation techniques, which learn only the spectral characteristics of the channel, by learning not only the spectral but also temporal characteristics. However, the LSTM-MLP uses the number of LSTM units variably depending on the position of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols in a frame, which not only increases the complexity of the system, but also has the disadvantage of making it difficult to learn the time-axis characteristics of the channel stably. To overcome this, in this paper, a simplified LSTM-MLP (sLSTM-MLP) technique is proposed, which uses the fixed number of LSTM units. In the proposed scheme, he LSTM is implemented to learn the temporal characteristics of the channel. After that, the spectral characteristics of the channel are learned by training the MLP network by receiving the output signal of the LSTM network. Because the proposed scheme uses the fixed number of LSTM units, it can reduce the computational complexity and guarantee the stable learning of the channel characteristics regardless of the position of OFDM symbols in a frame, resulting in enhancing the packet error rate (PER) performance. Through the simulation result, t was confirmed that the proposed technique exhibits superior performance compared to the existing deep learning-based channel estimation technique."

Especially, the development of deep learning-based object detection in various environmental changes has been progressing because those affect decreasing searching performance of the model.Among the various environmental variables, the accuracy of the object detection model is significantly dropped under low illuminance, and consistent object detection accuracy cannot be secured even the model is trained using low-light images. Accordingly, there is a need of low-light enhancement to keep the performance under low illuminance. Therefore, this paper conducts a comparative study of various deep learning-based low-light image enhancement models (GLADNet, KinD, LLFlow, Zero-DCE) using the acquired construction site image data.The low-light enhanced image was visually verified, and it was quantitatively analyzed by adopting image quality evaluation metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, Delta-E. As a result of the experiment, the low-light image enhancement performance of GLADNet showed excellent results in quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and it was analyzed to be suitable as a low-light image enhancement model.

A primary issue in personal credit scoring is the tendency of models to overfit on payment compliance data. This overfitting arises due to the relative scarcity of default cases. To address this, the SMOTE method was employed to artificially increase the data of the default class, mitigating the problem of data imbalance. The research adopted the TabNet deep learning model for efficiently processing high-dimensional financial data and enhanced the models generalization capabilities through transfer learning. This approach enables the model to perform better predictions on new data and reduces the risk of overfitting. The performance evaluation used metrics suitable for imbalanced data to compare and analyze the effectiveness of TabNet with and without SMOTE. The study results indicated that the TabNet model combined with SMOTE and transfer learning exhibited superior performance compared to other models."

In this paper, we introduce a score dropout technique, which is the novel approach to improve the performance of multi- view 3D reconstruction models. This technique compares the feature values extracted during the two- dimensional (2D) encoding process from multi-view images, specifies features with relatively low impact on the 3D reconstruction, and selectively dropouts them to improve performance. The main advantage of this method is that it does not require any additional learning parameters, but can enhance performance. Experiments applying this technique to the 3D-R2N2 model show that the 3D-GRU-3 model incorporating score dropout outperforms the Res-GRU-3 model with 14.3M more training parameters at five view. These results suggest that multi-view 3D reconstruction models can be expected to improve performance by incorporating score dropout."

This method synthesizes new damage images by paired text and image data. For this purpose, a training dataset of 678 images was secured, and fine-tuning was performed through low-rank adaptation. The quality of the generated images was compared according to three base models of stable diffusion. As a result, a method to synthesize the most diverse and high-quality concrete damage images was developed.

In particular, the framework of action research was established in the stages of ‘understanding-exploration-coaching-implementation-reflection’ to clarify, structure, concrete, and elaborate concept-based competency formation classes. In addition, through a purposeful sampling method, concept-based competency formation classes were divided into individual classroom classes and collaborative classroom classes in the context of teaching and learning, and implications were derived from the design and application of class units.Results  As a result of the analysis, it was found that concept-based competency formation classes aim for ‘deep learning’ that connects knowledge and information obtained through inquiry learning to form core concepts and transfer them to various situations and contexts. In particular, the unit design and application of the individual classroom teaching model (understanding the problem, establishing a solution plan, implementing the solution plan, reviewing the solution process) and the collaborative classroom teaching model (discovering the central problem, generating ideas, interactive interaction, and real-life application) We were seeking to build learners' capabilities through ‘deep learning’. In addition, according to individual classroom classes and collaborative classroom classes, the inquiry elements were set as questions and exploration, composition and explanation, understanding and action, and organization and reflection, and a synergy strategy for concept-based competency formation classes was presented. Using this synergy strategy, we designed classes for individual classroom classes and collaborative classroom classes and reflected expert opinions to organize considerations in terms of unit design for concept-based competency formation classes.Conclusions  Concept-based competency formation classes reflect the characteristics and learning environment of individual classroom classes and collaborative classroom classes, and it was found that “in-depth learning” is effective when unit design is developed into subject identification, subject exploration, task execution, and task evaluation."

It involves determining whether two voice data belong to the same speaker. In cases where the criminal's voice remains at the crime scene, it is vital to establish a speaker verification system that can accurately compare the two voice evidence. In this study, to achieve this, a new speaker verification system was built using a deep learning model for Korean language.

Advanced LSTM Channel Estimation Scheme in WAVE Communication Systems,2024,"['Deep Learning', 'Autoencoder', 'LSTM', 'Channel Estimation', 'WAVE Communication Systems']",,"In this paper, in order to overcome the channel distortion due to doubly selective channel, a new deep learning-based channel estimation scheme is proposed. In the proposed scheme, two neural networks are combined to learn both the temporal and spectral characteristics of the channel. One is the AE (autoencoder) which is trained to track the channel characteristic in the time domain and the other is the LSTM (long short term memory) which is trained to track the channel characteristic in the frequency domain. Firstly, the AE is trained and then the LSTM is sequentially trained based on the AE output. After that, the trained neural network is used to the conventional DPA (data pilot aided) process to estimate the channel values in frequency domain. It is noted that the proposed LSTM network consists of fixed number of LSTM units, so it enables to track the temporal variation of the channel reliably, regardless of the position of the OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) symbol in a frame. Therefore, the proposed scheme can enhance the PER (packet error rate) performance more by reducing the error propagation due to the DPA process. Through numerical results, it is confirmed that the proposed scheme shows the best PER performance of the conventional schemes in doubly selective channel environment."

Integrating the strengths of cVAE and cGAN into cAAE for advanced inverse design of colloidal quantum dots,2024,['Colloidal quantum dot · Inverse design · Deep learning · Conditional generative model'],,"Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit unique structures, which often result in distinctive optical properties such as emission and absorption spectra. However, QDs with diferent structures can sometimes show very similar emission and absorption spectra, making it difcult to inversely design their precise structural parameters from a given target emission and absorption spectra. To overcome this so-called one-to-many mapping problem, this paper introduces a novel deep-learning-based generative model for the inverse design of QDs. In particular, we implement three types of conditional generative models: the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), the conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE), and the conditional adversarial autoencoder (cAAE). Each model is designed and trained to predict possible layer thicknesses of QDs that can provide a given target emission and absorption spectra, thus providing possible multiple solutions rather than a single deterministic outcome. This multi-solution approach not only increases the fexibility in QD structure design, but also enhances the accuracy and efciency of the predictive process. According to calculation results, the cAAE stands out by efectively combining the strengths of both cGAN and cVAE. This integration allows cAAE to produce a more diverse and accurate inversely designed structures of InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs."

In an era where the complexities and intricacies of the Bible present significant challenges to contemporary readers, the prevalence of one-dimensional interpretations further obstructs the pathway to a profound comprehension of the spiritual depth embedded within its texts. By centering on Horst Klaus Berg’s influential theories in the field of German Bible didactics, this research delves into the impact of varied biblical interpretations on Christian education. Berg’s work is celebrated for its insightful strategies, notably his advocacy for comprehensive interpretative methods such as “Railway Tracks” and “Free-Learning.” These approaches seek to reconcile traditional biblical teachings with individual experiences, thereby facilitating a more expansive understanding of the Bible’s applicability to modern life. Through a detailed examination of Berg’s theory on biblical interpretation, this paper argues that Christian education must prioritize the cultivation of diverse interpretative skills and their practical integration into Bible study. This educational model encourages learners to become active interpreters, capable of discerning the text’s deep-seated meanings by relating it to their personal experiences. The study concludes by affirming Berg’s delineation of three critical tasks in biblical interpretation: “reciprocal interpretation,” “acknowledgment of the biblical texts’ diversity,” and “free learning.” These elements are portrayed as interrelated and essential, reinforcing Berg’s proposition that understanding the Bible’s complexity and diversity is crucial for advancing Christian education. This paper offers a novel perspective on the significance of embracing multifaceted interpretations within the domain of biblical studies."

Furthermore, the number of studies that employ RGB channel data is constantly increasing and they are achieving considerable performance enhancements. However, research on infrared images, including long wave infrared (LWIR), is neglected compared to RGB channel images. In this paper, we focus on LWIR data to evaluate the performance of YOLOX through a fine-tuning technique and confirm the possibility of applying pre-trained weights trained with RGB images to LWIR images.

The proposed algorithm consists of two steps. The first step is image preprocessing, which uses several preprocessing techniques such as gray-scale conversion, median blur, normalization, and brightness inversion to highlight the edges of cracks. In the second step, the canny edge detection algorithm is used to detect the boundaries of the cracks in the preprocessed image, and the YOLOv8 model is used to learn and detect the location of the corresponding cracks. The results show that the best performance is achieved when the YOLO model is trained using 6 steps of preprocessing and canny edge detection."

Furthermore, unsupervised DA methods could get a limited performance improvement if domain shift is larger than some extent.

LSTM-based Early Fire Detection System  using Small Amount Data,2024,"['Fire early detection', 'Multi-gas sensor', 'Deep-learning', 'LSTM']",,"Despite the continuous advancement of science and technology, fire accidents continue to occur without decreasing over time, so there is a constant need for a system that can accurately detect fires at an early stage. However, because most existing fire detection systems detect fire in the early stage of combustion when smoke is generated, rapid fire prevention actions may be delayed. Therefore we propose an early fire detection system that can perform early fire detection at a reasonable cost using LSTM, a deep learning model based on multi-gas sensors with high selectivity in the early stage of decomposition rather than the smoke generation stage. This system combines multiple gas sensors to achieve faster detection speeds than traditional sensors. In addition, through window sliding techniques and model light-weighting, the false alarm rate is low while maintaining the same high accuracy as existing deep learning. This shows that the proposed fire early detection system is a meaningful research in the disaster and engineering fields."
Spatio-Temporal Graph Normalizing Flows (STG-NF) 기반 공공장소 이상 탐지 일반화에 관한 연구,2024,"['Generation Model', 'Video Anomaly Detection', 'Deep Learning', 'Graph Convolution', 'Closed-Circuit Television']",,"Recently, there has been a growing adoption of deep-learning-based anomaly detection in Closed-Circuit Television systems for enhanced security in public spaces. Most of these video surveillance systems employ an unsupervised learning approach, relying on exclusive training with normal data for anomaly detection. This is achieved through the use of an autoencoder structure that processes RGB data, mainly due to the challenges associated with defining all abnormal behaviors. However, this approach encounters a reduction in recognition accuracy when the environment or location changes. To address this issue, there is a need for an additional step involving the collection of environment-specific data. In this paper, we adopt Spatial-Temporal Convolution Network to analyze skeleton data by constructing a spatiotemporally connected graph from video data and performing graph convolution. The proposed module interprets poses and movements in successive video frames based on information extracted from human joint data. Furthermore, to overcome the limited anomaly detection performance caused by the generalization performance boundary issue in existing autoencoder-based anomaly detection, we propose a normalized flow model to learn normal data and to discriminate anomalous data. Processing skeleton-based data and implementing anomaly detection through normalized flow not only minimizes the impact of environmental factors but also ensures consistent performance across diverse settings. This approach overcomes the limitations associated with autoencoder models relying on RGB data, making it applicable and effective in public spaces. In this paper, we additionally define anomalous behaviors that commonly observed in real public spaces, such as instances of fainting integrated into the dataset for a more practical anomaly detection and robust against environmental factors and it is evaluated using existing open datasets, demonstrating its capacity to operate realistically across diverse environments."

Therefore, it is necessary to foresee the icing situation so that it can ascend and descend at an altitude without a freezing point. In this study, vibration data in normal and faulty conditions was acquired, data features were extracted, and vibration was predicted through deep learning-based algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, Transformer, and TCN, and performance was compared to evaluate blade icing.

The Localization Effect of Online Advertising: An Evidence from the Movie Market,2024,"['movie poster', 'movie theater industry', 'international marketing', 'localization', 'image deep learning']",,"This study introduces a novel deep learning-based framework designed to evaluate the impact of localization in online advertising within the film industry. Particularly, the authors consider movie poster images as an advertising tool. Employing an image-based deep learning technique, the study extracts and quantifies visual information to assess poster localization levels. Then, we estimate the effect of poster localization on the movie’s financial performance in a foreign market. The results reveal that the localization effect follows the U-shaped curve, implying that the relevant level of poster localization should be in two ways: either fully non-localized or extremely localized. We expect this research to contribute by proposing the empirical framework to not only explore the effect of online advertising in the service business, but also assess the effect of the international advertising strategy from the perspective of the movie poster localization. Moreover, we posit that this research has managerial implications in the sense that it can contribute to the decision-making process of the relevant level of localization and poster image modification."

Method: This study conducted individual in-depth interviews with six teachers who were interested in the activity. Data collection took place from July 2023 to October 2023, and data were collected through 18 in-depth interviews and various records related to teachers’ activities over 18 in-depth interviews. Results: First, early childhood teachers had general images that activities had a structure and teachers took strong initiative, however, the perception of their activities appeared to change as they implemented the revised Nuri-curriculum. In particular, before the revision, teachers viewed play and activity as opposing concepts, but teachers felt that play and activity could not be divided while implementing the revised Nuri-curriculum. On the other hand, teachers also showed hesitation about if it would be right to engage in the activity itself. Second, teachers interpreted the meaning and methods of activities diversely as part of teaching and learning, while  carrying out a play-based curriculum. Based on this, they were effectively utilizing activities at appropriate moments. In this process, activities had meanings in three aspects: supporting play, supporting children, and supporting learning. Conclusion: Play and activity should be viewed as a continuous and intertwined relationship while fully understanding that activities have diverse values. It also indicates that there is a need to provide guidance on the role of teachers as facilitators in a broad perspective so that they can operate their activities smoothly as the main agent of the curriculum. In addition, it is required that teachers need to actively engage in practicing their activities based on deep reflection on how to perform activities considering the contents of learning."

YOLOv10 improves its performance compared to previous versions by adding an attention module, the PSA module. PSA is strong at recognising complex patterns in large areas because it uses some features of its own attention to reduce computation and learn global information. However, it may be inefficient for certain problems, such as weeds, which are generally small objects. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an improved YOLOv10 by applying another attention module, SENet, instead of the PSA module. Since, SENet learns the importance between channels, it can learn the features of weeds in more detail than the PSA module. In addition, SENet is lighter, less computationally intensive, and faster than the PSA module, so we conducted experiments by replacing the PSA module with SENet, which is suitable for weed detection. The experiment consisted of 200 training runs with a total of 14 classes, and we compared the performance through various performance evaluations. The experimental results showed that the FPS increased from 476.19 to 526.32, which is about 9.52% processing speed improvement. The mAP50-95 value increased from 88.7% to 88.3%, which shows that the proposed model is lighter than the existing model and performs similarly to the existing model."

The purpose of this study is to find out how much content knowledge is processed during English-medium instruction lectures by students using deep-level methods, i.e., critical thought, detailed information, and structure. Furthermore, the study investigates the potential correlation between the implementation of such strategies and the motivating beliefs and English listening proficiency of students. Using a mixed-methods approach, questionnaire responses and semi-structured interviews from 60 students in Korea were gathered.

In this study, the interface of a laser-welded region is investigated using optical coherence tomography to detect internal pore defects, where the maximum thickness of the liner is found to be approximately 3 mm. Optical coherence tomography images with defects are then used for supervised YOLOv2 deep learning. Real-time detection of internal defects is successfully performed on laser-welded liner samples."

With technology available for understanding and addressing the emotional needs of people, this study aims to develop speech emotion recognition (SER) technology to classify emotions for people at high risk of dementia. Methods: Speech samples from people at high risk of dementia were categorized into distinct emotions via human auditory assessment, the outcomes of which were annotated for guided deep-learning method. The architecture incorporated convolutional neural network, long short-term memory, attention layers, and Wav2Vec2, a novel feature extractor to develop automated speech-emotion recognition. Results: Twenty-seven kinds of Emotions were found in the speech of the participants. These emotions were grouped into 6 detailed emotions: happiness, interest, sadness, frustration, anger, and neutrality, and further into 3 basic emotions: positive, negative, and neutral. To improve algorithmic performance, multiple learning approaches were applied using different data sources-voice and text-and varying the number of emotions. Ultimately, a 2-stage algorithm-initial text-based classification followed by voice-based analysis-achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 70%. Conclusions: The diverse emotions identified in this study were attributed to the characteristics of the participants and the method of data collection. The speech of people at high risk of dementia to companion robots also explains the relatively low performance of the SER algorithm. Accordingly, this study suggests the systematic and comprehensive construction of a dataset from people with dementia."

With regard to an offline-based personal color diagnosis, experts conduct the diagnosis based on a sensory evaluation, while an online-based personal color diagnosis utilizes application-based methods that involve analyzing user-captured facial images. However, the online-based personal color diagnosis, widely used for its convenience and low cost, faces challenges related to accuracy due to factors such as lighting conditions and noise that arise when the user captures their facial image. Moreover, existing personal color diagnosis services lack the ability to provide a virtual makeup experience that closely resembles reality. This study aims to achieve consistent online personal color diagnosis results by proposing an algorithm that analyzes user-captured facial images in various color spaces and extracts representative skin colors. To ensure an accurate personal color analysis, potential hindrances to personal color diagnoses were eliminated using a YOLOv5-based object-recognition deep-learning model. Additionally, a clustering-based data analysis algorithm was employed to derive representative facial colors. Based on these representative facial colors, the study diagnosed personal color types and ultimately provided users with a virtual makeup function that enhances their aesthetic experience. The virtual makeup feature uses the BeautyGAN generative deep-learning model to show the most harmonious makeup styles for each user, enabling them to actively select makeup items that best suit their preferences."
자율주행 차량의 스테레오 카메라 이미지의 Instance Segmentation을 이용한 3차원 다중 객체 추적,2024,"['multiple object tracking', 'computer vision', 'stereo camera', 'real-time', 'autonomous driving', '.']",,"This study proposes a novel approach for estimating the location of an obstacle during autonomous driving using a stereo camera. Deep learning-based object detection, YOLOv8 was employed to secure real-time performance and achieve high accuracy in detecting the obstacles. Despite the advantages of this scheme, its overall performance may be hindered by the introduction of noise due to uncertainty in IoU(Intersection over Union) and recall when estimating three-dimensional positions using bounding boxes. This can lead to serious problems in path planning or vehicle control and cause fatal accidents during autonomous driving. Therefore, a 3D object position estimation method has been devised in this work in order to resolve this issue. This technique provides robust protection against uncertainty in detecting obstacles through a synergistic effect of deep learning-based instance segmentation, feature point tracking, and multiple object tracking. Thus, a new method for estimating the 3D location of objects using instance segmentation and multiple object tracking has been developed in this work, which is available in real time for real-world applications."

In this paper, we propose a monitoring procedure using the latent vector of LSTM Autoencoder, a deep learning-based unsupervised learning method. We compare the performance of this procedure with the LSTM Autoencoder procedure based on the reconstruction error, the RNN classification procedure, and the residual charting procedure through simulation studies. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed procedure and the RNN classification procedure are similar, but the proposed procedure has the advantage of being useful in processes where sufficient out-of-control data cannot be obtained, because it does not require out-of-control data for training."

A recently developed network model with a deep-learning scheme is considered as a promising solution to overcome such gas sensor drift problems. In this context, we present an improved multi-model ensemble network consisting of tabular data learning network (TabNet), support vector machine (SVM), and long short-term memory (LSTM). The proposed TabNet–SVM–LSTM (TSL) ensemble was implemented by employing a software-based approach for the gas sensor drift compensation without modifying hardware components. To validate the proposed TSL ensemble, a gas sensor drift dataset obtained from the UCI machine learning repository was considered. The dataset spans three years and comprises data from sixteen metal-oxide gas sensors monitoring six distinct volatile organic compounds under tightly controlled operational conditions. The extensive experiments showed that the TSL ensemble can adeptly manage sensor drift and outperform baseline competitive schemes for gas sensor drift compensation."

Enhancing Chest X-ray Image Super-Resolution through Residual Group and Channel Attention,2024,"['Chest X-ray', 'Super-Resolution', 'Remaining Enhanced channel attention block', 'Exponential Liner Unit', 'Structure Similarity Index', 'Multi Structure Similarity Index.']",,"Medical imaging plays a crucial role in medical diagnosis, with chest X-ray imaging being a widely employed method for screening and diagnosing pulmonary diseases due to its cost-effectiveness. However, low-resolution images generated by expensive equipment and suboptimal imaging techniques often lead to a loss of critical features and acceptable texture. The acquisition of high-quality medical images is paramount for accurate disease diagnosis. This study introduces an innovative approach for reconstructing super-resolution medical images using deep learning techniques, explicitly targeting chest X-ray images. The proposed method, the Pathologically Invariant Remaining Enhanced Channel Attention Block (RECAB), incorporates the Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function. The primary objective is to accurately recover high-resolution (HR) chest X-ray images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts, leveraging a channel attention mechanism and convolution layer with the ELU activation function―the evaluation of the proposed method involved two datasets, X-Ray 2017 and X-Ray 2014. A comprehensive comparison was conducted with several state-of-the-art techniques, including GAN-based super-resolution, deep learning-based super-resolution, and interpolation-based super-resolution. The quality of the preprocessed images was assessed using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MSIM). The results prove the higher performance of the proposed method, which outperformed the average of 8.6% and 11.6% in SSIM and MSIM values by 11% and 12.14% on the two datasets, respectively.

This study aims to visualize the process of Japanese language acquisition and to gain a deeper understanding of the comprehensive nature of language learning. It explores how a child's thoughts, actions, and values are shaped through various experiences. To achieve this, narratives generated through a narrative approach are depicted in a TEM diagram. The analysis of the researcher's life path, revealed that while the degree of engagement with Japanese learning fluctuates across different life stages, experiences involving deep interaction with others have a significant impact on language acquisition. The findings of this survey are categorized into three distinct periods. Since successive word learning typically begins at home, the classification of periods can be seen as a reflection of the child's developmental stages. During childhood, parents’ play a key role in creating a language-rich and supportive learning environment. However, to sustain learning, it has been observed that children independently construct meaning in Japanese as they progress. The study re-examines the significance of cultivating ‘words that speak and engage with others.’ It emphasizes that, rather than aiming to master inherited words as a mother tongue, the focus should be on their role in human development, identity formation, and thought development. In other words, meaningful heritage language education involves continuously questioning what constitutes child development. It suggests the need to shift away from monolingual education and embrace multilingual and multicultural approaches."
Research on Equal-resolution Image Hiding Encryption Based on Image Steganography and Computational Ghost Imaging,2024,"['Computational ghost imaging', 'Deep learning', 'Equal-resolution image steganography', 'Optical image encryption']",,"Information-hiding technology is introduced into an optical ghost imaging encryption scheme, which can greatly improve the security of the encryption scheme.

日本における「学び」の解釈―『論語』の学而篇の「學」の解釈を例として―,2024,"['まなぶ、まねぶ、論語、學、注釈者', 'learn', 'imitate', 'Analecte', 'Gaku', 'interpeter']",,"In ancient Japan, there was no written language. In other words, in order to learn something, it was important to ‘imitate’ the other person. There was no self-study, and no systematic ‘learning’. However, when written language was introduced, the meaning of ‘learning’ became more significant. It is thought that it changed into ‘learning’ that required deep thought. This was particularly evident in the Edo period. The concrete practice of ‘learning’ was attempted by using the Analects. Ito Jinsai 伊藤仁斎 considered ‘learning’ to be imitation, while Ogyu Sorai 荻生徂徠 considered the purpose of learning to be ‘learning the ways of the former kings’. Furthermore, the purpose of learning is to improve one’s own virtue through the ways learned from one’s teacher. ‘Learning’ was interpreted as ‘acquiring’ and ‘knowledge’, and in the late Edo period, the concept was formed that ‘learning’ belongs to ‘knowledge’ and ‘practice’ belongs to ‘practice’, which expresses accumulated ‘learning’ (knowledge). This is thought to have changed from Zhu Xi 朱子’s interpretation, in which ‘learning’ was the concept of remembering and realizing things, to being influenced by Yangmingism 陽明学.Furthermore, during the Meiji period, Western words were imported. Shibusawa Eiichi 渋沢栄一, backed by the idea of ​​the unity of knowledge and action, spoke of utilizing the Analects of Confucius as practical ethics. Shibusawa probably thought ‘learning’ as ‘knowledge for practice’, and that ‘learning’ and ‘practice’ should be one and the same. On the other hand, Nishi Amane 西周, who also came into contact with Western words, spoke of knowledge and action, but thought ‘learning’ and ‘practice’ as separate entities. In particular, he considered ‘learning’ as the pursuit of the psychology of things, and drew a line between it and everyday life. After that, ‘learning’ developed into something that pursues truths that are separate from everyday life.As mentioned above, by looking at how ‘learning’ is perceived, we can find the change in the attitude towards learning in Japanese society. There, the meaning of learning changed due to foreign influences, and attempts were made to incorporate it into everyday life. Since the modern era, it appears that learning has been influenced by the West and has evolved into something more detached from everyday life."

The empirical results showed that the multi-level wavelet decomposition network (mWDN) was the most effective deep learning algorithm for predicting KLPGA players cut outcomes, with an F1-score of 0.75. When comparing the predicted player list based on deep learning algorithms with the actual list of players who passed the cut in the top three tournaments with the highest prize money held during the 2023 KLPGA tour, it accurately predicted the cut outcomes of 276 out of 352 players (78.4%).

TD3 Algorithm of Dynamic Classification Replay Buffer Based PID Parameter Optimization,2024,"['Deep reinforcement learning', 'intelligent optimization', 'PID parameter optimization', 'twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3).']",,"In industrial control, PID controllers are widely used, but their control performance depends heavily on the parameters of the controller. However, the adjustment of PID controller parameters is cumbersome and inefficient. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has been gradually introduced into the industrial control field due to its advantage of being able to learn autonomously by interacting with the environment. In this paper, a PID parameter optimization method based on TD3 algorithm of dynamic classification replay buffer (DCRB-TD3) is proposed. By designing the optimization framework, the optimization process of the PID parameters is converted into the learning process of the weights of the actor network. In order to improve the learning efficiency of the reinforcement learning algorithm, avoid the phenomenon of control curve dispersion and ensure that the whole process can be continuously closed-loop optimized. In this paper, the regular TD3 algorithm is improved, a dynamic classification ratio strategy is designed, and a sampling update method for dynamic classification experience replay is proposed. Finally, simulations are performed on various systems, and DCRB-TD3 is compared with the PID parameter optimization method based on the PSO algorithm. The results show that the PID parameters optimized by DCRB-TD3 have better control performance than other methods."

However, they suffer from pooraccuracy in various environmental conditions such as nighttime, fog, rain, and snow. On the other hand, IR (Infrared) images areprocessed with only thermal information, so the resolution is lower than RGB images, but they are less sensitive to environmentalconditions. While there are various object detection models using deep learning recently, YOLO, known for its high accuracy andfast processing speed, has been widely adopted. However, since YOLO is designed based on RGB images, it needs to be adaptedfor IR images to perform object detection effectively. In addition, in order to use deep learning algorithms that require a largeamount of computation in edge devices, it is necessary to reduce weight for real-time processing. In this paper, in order to modifyand reduce the weight of the existing YOLOv5 model to fit the IR image, the existing three-layer head was reduced to two layers,and CBAM was added to improve accuracy.

When adjusting the gate size of a digital circuit using a performance-enhanced AGD algorithm, the QoR (quality of result) was -0.1572 based on SynopsysDC. This is an indicator of how the tuning of hyperparameters and the application of appropriate optimization techniques affect the model. This paper says that hyperparameter tuning and optimization techniques suitable for deep learning models are factors that can increase performance. Moreover, the performance-enhanced AGD algorithm could be used in several areas that require optimization."

Moreover, multiple deep learning models compete for system resources such as CPU and memory to meet the diverse needs of users and improve recognition accuracy. MLPerf was developed to objectively evaluate these deep learning model execution devices. However, the current MLPerf executes DNN models in a serialized manner, which does not reflect the real-world environment where multiple DNN models are running. In this paper, we improve MLPerf to enable the simultaneous execution needs of multiple DNNs through multi-threading-based query parallelization, and to enable multiple DNN models to be executed on the target system similar to the real environment. The experimental results show that the query processing performance is about two times higher than the existing one, which is similar to the actual execution environment."

In transportation facilities, where HVAC systems are installed, they control and adjust the temperature, humidity, and intake of air within interior spaces, ensuring a pleasant environment, enhancing service quality, and safeguarding user health. However, these systems, which are both large-scale and highly complex, pose challenges when it comes to timely and eff ective problemsolving using a run-to-fail policy-based reactive maintenance approach. Therefore, there is a growing demand for deep learning models capable of HVAC fault detection to design preventive management using AI. These deep learning models typically receive input in the form of time-series data generated by various sensors in HVAC systems or images generated through transformation algorithms that intuitively represent time-series data. However, conventional deep learning models for analyzing these data types tend to focus on either temporal or spatial features. Hence, to utilize both temporal and spatial features simultaneously, we propose a transformer-based hybrid model. The proposed model leverages the Gramian Angular Diff erence Field algorithm, one of the image transformation algorithms, to convert multivariate time-series data from HVAC into multi-channel images. It then performs each second anomaly detection by combining feature information extracted through encoders from both transformer and vision transformer. In experimental datasets, the anomaly detection performance achieved an F1 score of 0.9965. As a result, this demonstrates that the proposed deep learning model can enhance the overall reliability and safety of HVAC systems, and showing that deep learning models can serve as crucial toolsin enhancing the maintenance and safety of HVAC systems."

Traditional methods rely on epipolar geometry to construct cost volumes, but they have two major drawbacks: (1) they assume a static environment and (2) they require pose information during inference. Consequently, these methods struggle in real-world scenarios with dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose using the cross-attention map as a comprehensive cost volume to address these limitations. We show that training the cross-attention layers for image reconstruction enables implicit learning of a warping function, similar to the explicit epipolar warping in conventional methods. We introduce CRoss-Attention map and Feature aggregaTor (CRAFT), designed to effectively aggregate and refine the full cost volume. We also implement CRAFT hierarchically, enhancing depth predictions through a coarse-to-fine approach. Evaluations on the Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional techniques, showing robustness in challenging conditions with dynamic objects."

Holography is a technology that records and reproduces three-dimensional stereoscopic information on a two-dimensional flat surface of a recording medium using a recording light source. Since the holographic recording results are in an analog form, the process of evaluating the recorded results has been limited by mathematical calculation methods so far, or has been dependent on subjective and visual reviews. To solve these problems, a system that automatically evaluates the quality of holographic recording results quantitatively and objectively was implemented. We created 1,200 new images to be used in the learning dataset by classifying them according to grade. The images were classified into 6 grades so that they could be distinguished as overexposed or underexposed by the recording light source in the quality evaluation of the hologram. Since the captured images of holographic recording results are different from those of general digital photographs, a CNN model was designed to meet the criteria in order to distinguish them by differentiating the quality evaluation criteria."

Since it is very difficult to acquire fault data in the field, unsupervised learning methods that can be trained using only normal state data are mainly used. However, unsupervised learning methods are very vulnerable to disturbances and are difficult to express the fault level. Disturbances in the field include electrical noise, which can cause data acquisition devices to fail due to low power quality in the field and affect the measured signal, and mechanical noise, such as external vibrations, which directly affect the operation of the electric motor. To minimize the impact of electrical noise, it is common to use hardware filters. Unlike previous studies that use theoretical cutoff frequency setting methods, this paper proposes a method to find the appropriate cutoff frequency using LRP(Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) analysis, one of the XAI(eXplainable A.I) techniques, for practical data acquisition.Fault diagnosis in the field requires robust unsupervised learning algorithms that can ignore the presence of mechanical noise in the signal, such as transient shocks. This is solved by post-processing the output of the auto-encoder with a moving average filter. To represent the fault level a data generation technique, the mix-up algorithm, is used. A method is proposed to threshold the auto-encoder multiple times with data generated by the mix-up algorithm. This proposed method shows the availability of motor fault diagnosis considering the on-site data."

The purpose of segmentation is to simplify or transform the expression of the image to make it more meaningful and easier to interpret. Among these, semantic segmentation classifies an image pixel-by-pixel. This paper proposes a method to obtain multispectral images of plants using a multi-lens camera and build a semantic segmentation dataset by matching the images for each band. Matching the images is essential for analysis because the camera used for filming is a system that acquires images of a single wavelength with seven lenses. A method of matching the remaining images based on one of five wavelength images related to color was applied for image registration. ORB was used as a method for matching. A semantic segmentation dataset for deep learning was constructed based on the matched images. Plants generally tend to have relatively high pixel values in the green channel in the visible light range compared to the red and blue channels and have large pixel values in the infrared range. Therefore, only the plant portion of the image can be segmented semantically by setting an appropriate threshold for pixel values using all R, G, B, and NIR wavelengths. Through experiments, a mean IOU (Ed note: Please define IOU.)of 0.991142 and cross-entropy of 0.011507 were obtained based on a training data set of 100 using DeepLab v3+.

However, the experiments conducted using the DA (Domain Adaptation) RetinaNet model, which applied adversarial domain adaptation techniques to RetinaNet, revealed no performance improvement. This lack of improvement was attributed to the fact that the size of the car license plate data used was smaller compared to the model size.

Prognostication of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Artificial Intelligence,2024,"['Radiomics', 'Deep learning', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Machine learning', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Hepatoma', 'Liver', 'Cancer', 'Malignancy', 'Neoplasm']",,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a biologically heterogeneous tumor characterized by varying degrees of aggressiveness. The current treatment strategy for HCC is predominantly determined by the overall tumor burden, and does not address the diverse prognoses of patients with HCC owing to its heterogeneity. Therefore, the prognostication of HCC using imaging data is crucial for optimizing patient management. Although some radiologic features have been demonstrated to be indicative of the biologic behavior of HCC, traditional radiologic methods for HCC prognostication are based on visually-assessed prognostic findings, and are limited by subjectivity and inter-observer variability. Consequently, artificial intelligence has emerged as a promising method for image-based prognostication of HCC. Unlike traditional radiologic image analysis, artificial intelligence based on radiomics or deep learning utilizes numerous image-derived quantitative features, potentially offering an objective, detailed, and comprehensive analysis of the tumor phenotypes. Artificial intelligence, particularly radiomics has displayed potential in a variety of applications, including the prediction of microvascular invasion, recurrence risk after locoregional treatment, and response to systemic therapy. This review highlights the potential value of artificial intelligence in the prognostication of HCC as well as its limitations and future prospects."

In the present study, the Unity game engine— which has recently come to be used in various engineering simulations because of its accurate physics calculations—was used to construct a reinforcement learning environment for structural control systems. A smart base isolation system (SBIS) that was composed of a magnetorheological damper and four friction pendulum systems was used as an example structural control system, and it was modeled using the Unity physics engine for RL environment.

The reward of the DQN algorithm was designed to be a higher value when the agent takes a better action resulting in reduced seismic responses. Three artifi cial ground motions were used to train the DQN-based control algorithm, and another artifi cial earthquake was used to investigate the control effi ciency of the trained DQN-based control algorithm.

LLIE methods based on deep learning show good performance. However, there are some limitations to these methods, such as the complex network model requires highly configurable environments, and deficient enhancement of edge details leads to blurring of the target content. Single-scale feature extraction results in the insufficient recovery of the hidden content of the enhanced images. This paper proposed an edge detection-based multi-scale feature enhancement network for LLIE (EDMFEN). To reduce the loss of edge details in the enhanced images, an edge extraction module consisting of a Sobel operator is introduced to obtain edge information by computing gradients of images. In addition, a multi-scale feature enhancement module (MSFEM) consisting of multi-scale feature extraction block (MSFEB) and a spatial attention mechanism is proposed to thoroughly recover the hidden content of the enhanced images and obtain richer features. Since the fused features may contain some useless information, the MSFEB is introduced so as to obtain the image features with different perceptual fields. To use the multi-scale features more effectively, a spatial attention mechanism module is used to retain the key features and improve the model performance after fusing multi-scale features. Experimental results on two datasets and five baseline datasets show that EDMFEN has good performance when compared with the state-of-the-art LLIE methods."

To mitigate data scarcity, data augmentation techniques like image rotation and zoom are commonly employed. Excessive use of these techniques, however, risks overfitting to the training data. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue by generating abnormal data through image translation using CycleGAN and anomaly image synthesis using SinGAN. The study demonstrates the positive impact of integrating generated abnormal data into the training dataset on model performance, as evidenced by comparing the performance before and after the addition of synthesized images in a classification model."

Signal Augmentation Method based on Mixing and Adversarial Training for Better Robustness and Generalization,2024,"['Adversarial training', 'automatic modulation recognition', 'data augmentation', 'mixing signals', 'robustnes']",,"More and more deep learning methods have been applied to wireless communication systems. However, the collection of authentic signal data poses challenges. Moreover, due to the vulnerability of neural networks, adversarial attacks seriously threaten the security of communication systems based on deep learning models. Traditional signal augmentation methods expand the dataset through transformations such as rotation and flip, but these methods improve the adversarial robustness of the model little. However, common methods to improve adversarial robustness such as adversarial training not only have a high computational overhead but also potentially lead to a decrease in accuracy on clean samples. In this work, we propose a signal augmentation method called Adversarial and Mixed-based Signal Augmentation (AMSA). The method can improve the adversarial robustness of the model while expanding the dataset and does not compromise the generalization ability. It combines adversarial training with data mixing and then interpolates selected pairs of samples to form new samples in an expanded dataset consisting of original and adversarial samples thus generating more diverse data. We conduct experiments on the RML2016.10a and RML2018.01a datasets using automatic modulation recognition (AMR) models based on CNN, LSTM, CLDNN, and Transformer. And compare the performance in scenarios with different numbers of samples. The results show that AMSA allows the model to achieve comparable or even better adversarial robustness than using adversarial training, and reduces the degradation of the model's generalization performance on clean data."

Typically, container stowage plans are manually created by planners who consider factors such as destination, size, type, and weight of the  cargo,  making  the  process  time-consuming  and  error-prone.  To  address  this  issue,  we employed the DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm, a type of reinforcement learning, to establish an optimal container stowage plan. We proposed a method for defining state using the character- istics of the containers and compared it with traditional methods, using constraints such as desti- nation port and weight. The state definition method proposed in this study has the advantage of not exponentially increasing the number of states with the size of the stowage space by using characteristic values related to the loading status of each row. Initially, the performance of the DQN algorithm was verified using destination port as the only constraint. Subsequently, weight constraints were added to the state definition method that showed better performance. The study results show that the proposed method successfully established a stowage plan that satisfies all constraints in a 4×4 stowage space without causing re-handles, across nine test container lists."

How Do Fluctuations in Raw Material Prices Affect the Final Product Prices? Can This Be Predicted Utilizing AI Models?,2024,"['Agricultural Product Prices', 'Machine Learning', 'ARIMA', 'VAR', 'LSTM', '농산물 가격', '머신러닝', 'ARIMA', 'VAR', 'LSTM']",,"Globally, prices are soaring, and among these, agricultural product prices are experiencing significant increases. Agricultural products are essential for human survival and have a direct impact, making this a highly sensitive issue. This problem has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war, leading to even greater price hikes. Consequently, this situation places a considerable burden not only on consumers but also on the companies that process and produce these agricultural products. In particular, South Korea, a country with a high dependency on imports, relies on foreign markets for many agricultural products. However, despite this reliance, there is a lack of research on predicting the prices of imported agricultural products. For this reason, this study implements an AI model that predicts the retail prices of final products based on fluctuations in the prices of imported agricultural products, focusing on key research questions (RQs) and the distribution process. In addition, it examines the impact of global issues such as supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19 and the Ukraine-Russia war on price inflation.In this study, the top three imported agricultural products―corn, wheat, and soybeans―are selected as key imported agricultural items, and the prediction model is implemented focusing on the processed foods most commonly consumed in daily life that are manufactured from these products. At this time, key variables are added by taking into account the distribution and manufacturing processes involved in the processing of agricultural products.Specifically, the relationships between these variables are analyzed through correlation analysis, and a prediction model is implemented using big data analysis to select the model with the highest prediction accuracy. In this study, the VAR model showed the highest prediction accuracy among machine learning models, while the LSTM model demonstrated the highest accuracy among deep learning models.In conclusion, the academic implications of this study demonstrate that the impact of the international commodity market and global trade on the production and distribution of domestic companies can be scientifically analyzed and proposed through AI models. Additionally, the study systematically identified and explained the raw material supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic from an academic perspective. Furthermore, the practical implications of this study for companies are significant. By utilizing this research, companies can identify how price fluctuations in imported agricultural products affect the pricing of final products. It allows them to proactively respond to changes in the prices of final products by applying the forecasting model. Additionally, companies can confirm the relationship between the prices of imported agricultural products and the retail prices of final products, gaining a clearer understanding of the costs incurred during domestic and international distribution processes. It can be used to drive innovations in the distribution structure."
FPGA-based Inference Parallelization for Onboard RL-based Routing in Dynamic LEO Satellite Networks,2024,"['Heterogeneous processor', 'Parallelization', 'Deep reinforcement learning']",,"This paper addresses the problem of onboard computer application of dynamic low-orbit satellite network routing algorithms. In low-orbit satellite networks, the satellite topology changes in real time, and satellite disconnection occurs frequently. The problem of routing algorithms for low-orbit satellites can be solved by reinforcement learning algorithms. However, the inference process based on deep reinforcement learning models suffers from excessive computation due to the operation of multiple convolutional layers. In this paper, we propose a method to accelerate convolutional layer operations by parallelizing them using heterogeneous processors. This approach is compared to the traditional single-processor-based convolutional operation method, commonly used in dynamic low-orbit satellite network routing algorithms. Our evaluation, conducted on an actual heterogeneous processor-based onboard computer, demonstrates that the proposed method not only matches the accuracy of the conventional single-processor-based approach, but also significantly reduces the execution time."

It resembles the functions of a biologꠓical brain, enabling energy-efficient and real-time processing. Despite being hardware-friendly, SNNs still require considerable computational resources. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Spiking Neural Network (CSNN) architecture that leverages a preprocessed dataset for hardware accelerator-based pruning to reduce latency and power consumption. The dataset is encoded as binary data and preprocessed on the front-end by sorting it based on patterns. Once the dataset is input into the hardware accelerator, the system identifies data that does not require convolution operations. This allows the removal of inactive neurons at the Register Transfer Level (RTL). Since the neurons to be removed follow a similar pattern to the pruned neurons in the previous time step, the cost of removal is almost negligible. By pruning neurons dynamically for each input image, a more efficient, high-speed, low-power hardware accelerator can be achieved. The pattern-based dataset classification was implemented in Python, while the hardware accelerator was developed using Verilog and synthesized on an FPGA. This approach reduces power consumption by 80.02%, while also requiring 7.27% fewer gates and achieving a 90.1% improvement compared to traditional convolutional spiking neural networks and conventional CNNs. The accuracy reaches 90.56% and each input is calculated in 8955 clock cycles, which takes 0.53s for 60000 images in 100MHz board. This approach demonstrates the potential for enabling real-time learning on NPUs by integrating learning accelerators in future applications."

However, the data collected through such devices are limited by outliers and missing values owing to the anomalous and irregular characteristics of pets. Hence, we propose pet behavior recognition based on a hybrid one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short- term memory (LSTM) model using pet wearable devices. An Arduino-based pet wearable device was first fabricated to collect data for behavior recognition, where gyroscope and accelerometer values were collected using the device. Then, data augmentation was performed after replacing any missing values and outliers via preprocessing. At this time, the behaviors were classified into five types. To prevent bias from specific actions in the data augmentation, the number of datasets was compared and balanced, and CNN-LSTM-based deep learning was performed. The five subdivided behaviors and overall performance were then evaluated, and the overall accuracy of behavior recognition was found to be about 88.76%."

High-Voltage Transmission Line Foreign Object and Power Component Defect Detection Based on Improved YOLOv5,2024,['Transmission line inspection · Aerial images · Object detection · Recursive gated convolution'],,"With the outstanding performance of deep learning in the feld of computer vision, the automatic visual detection of foreign bodies in transmission lines and electrical equipment defects by inspection robots and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles based on neural networks has become an attractive topic in smart grid. However, in practical application scenarios, small-sized target defects pose a great challenge to the detection accuracy of existing mainstream deep learning detection networks with limited perceptual felds. To solve the above problems, the paper proposes a detection model of YOLOv5 transmission line inspection image. Firstly, the key target images under diferent backgrounds and attitudes are collected and preprocessed.Specifcally, in order to improve the perception ability of networks for small-sized targets, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to optimize the size of the anchor box, which efectively improves the ftting ability of the key target features. Then, recursive gated convolution is used as the backbone network to improve the ability to extract key target features. Finally, considering the concealment of small-scale features, the space-to-depth convolution module is added to the neck network to realize down-sampling and retain all the information in the channel dimension. In addition, a feature prediction layer is added to optimize the scale of network detection, and a Simple Parameter-Free Attention Module is added to further optimize the characterization of network features. The experimental results show that the accuracy and recall of the proposed network are 96.8% and 93.3%, respectively. The average detection accuracy reaches 97.1%, which is 3.8% higher than that of YOLOv5 network, 5.2% higher than YOLOv6 and 1.0% higher than that of YOLOv7 network. The proposed method signifcantly improves the detection performance of critical targets and defects of high-voltage transmission lines."

SSF can provide additional forensic evidence through laboratory tests such as diatom and electrolyte analyses. If drowning is suspected, accurately assessing the presence and volume of SSF during an autopsy is crucial. Utilizing postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) images could aid in accurately sampling SSF. Accurately segmenting the region of interest is essential for volume analysis using computed tomography images. However, manual segmentation techniques are labor-intensive and time-consuming, and their success depends on the experience of the observer. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a U-Net–based deep learning model for the automatic segmentation of SSF in drowning cases using PMCT images and to evaluate the performance of the model. We retrospectively reviewed 34 drowning cases in which both PMCT scans and forensic autopsies were performed at our institution.

Our proposed method is a variation of the Split-Transform-Merge (STM) strategy, widely employed in the existing deep learning image classification domain, adapted universally to the Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) domain. The primary aim of our technique is to enhance depth estimation performance. Traditionally, there were two tasks in this domain: regression, which involves inputting and outputting a single image into the network, and classification, which predefined discretized depth value classes (Bins). The classification task aimed to obtain the Bins probability value for each pixel as the network output. However, a paradigm shift has shifted from predefined Bins to adaptive Bins technology. This technology allows learning by adding a Bins estimation module to the final network output. Recent research has focused on various types of Bins estimation modules to achieve more accurate adaptive Bins estimation. One limitation arises when high-dimensional feature map representations are input to the Bins estimation module. These representations are projected and input as low-dimensional feature map representations, inevitably leading to information loss. We propose a novel Split-Transform-Conversion-Merge (STCM) strategy to address these limitations. This strategy delves deep into the relationship between feature map representations and Bins estimation modules, thereby improving the boundaries of information loss. To validate the performance of our proposed strategy, we applied it to various MDE techniques, observing significant improvements in performance across all evaluation metrics.

In this paper, we propose a wavelet transform-based CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model, namely the WT-DnCNN(Wavelet Transform-Denoising Convolutional Neural Network) model, to improve noise removal performance. This model first removes noise by dividing the noisy image into frequency bands using wavelet transform, and then applies the existing DnCNN model to the corresponding frequency bands to finally remove noise. In order to evaluate the performance of the WT-DnCNN model proposed in this paper, experiments were conducted on MRI and CT images damaged by various noises, namely Gaussian noise, Poisson noise, and speckle noise. The performance experiment results show that the WT-DnCNN model is superior to the traditional filter, i.e., the BM3D(Block-Matching and 3D Filtering) filter, as well as the existing deep learning models, DnCNN and CDAE(Convolution Denoising AutoEncoder) model in qualitative comparison, and in quantitative comparison, the PSNR(Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM(Structural Similarity Index Measure) values were 36~43 and 0.93~0.98 for MRI images and 38~43 and 0.95~0.98 for CT images, respectively. In addition, in the comparison of the execution speed of the models, the DnCNN model was much less than the BM3D model, but it took a long time due to the addition of the wavelet transform in the comparison with the DnCNN model."

Signals from rotating and non-rotating equipment included in the Malfunctioning Industrial Machine Investigation and Inspection (MIMII) dataset were applied to a deep learning model. We applied unsupervised learning methods utilizing the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Domain Adaptation Neural Network (DANN). First, VAEs were utilized to diagnose the fault. The statistical features of the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) coefficients of the acoustic signal were utilized to extract features that can be used regardless of the length of the audio signal. Considering the characteristics of rotating equipment, feature enhancement was performed by applying Magnitude Spectral Subtraction and feature lightweight, and data augmentation was performed by utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on the extracted features. Although VAE can create a fault classifier using only steady-state data, improving and augmenting the features was necessary considering the characteristics of non-rotating and rotating equipment. The increased ambient noise reduced the accuracy, showing that VAE can accurately diagnose failures. The data used for training contains a domain shift between the laboratory environment and the actual operating environment, which represents a problem where a fault classifier trained on data from the laboratory environment may have poor diagnostic performance in the real world. To solve this problem, a Domain Adaptive Neural Network (DANN) was applied. DANN does not require additional data processing and can utilize labels from the source domain to diagnose faults in the target domain. By utilizing the advantages of the above two methods, we showed that fault diagnosis can be adapted even if the environment of a given equipment changes by combining the procedures according to the noise situation."

In electromagnetic warfare, analyzing the radar signals of hostile forces is a crucial activity to gain superiority. Particularly, the technique to classify modulation schemes of radar signals collected without prior information plays a vital role in enabling friendly forces to identify the presence of threats and obtain valuable intelligence. For radar signal modulation classification, the use of binary time-frequency image (TFI) has the advantage of improving system memory efficiency over grayscale TFI, but with the drawback of image pattern distortion during binarization. This paper proposes a novel binary TFI generation method that reduces pattern distortion. To achieve this, we first generate a grayscale TFI of the received radar signal, then reduce the noise in the image by extracting the frequency component-related information through temporal marginalization of the grayscale TFI. Subsequently, the noise-reduced image is standardized and clipped along the frequency axis for pattern enhancement, followed by global thresholding for binarization. Through computer simulations, we show that the binary TFI generated with the proposed method can effectively classify 37 single and composite radar modulation schemes. Furthermore, we verify that for various deep learning models, the proposed method shows better classification performance than the binary TFIs generated using conventional methods."
A Prospective Technique for Damage Detection in Truss Structures Using the Fusion of DNN with AVOA,2024,"['Structural health monitoring', 'Damage detection', 'African vulture optimization algorithm', 'Deep neural network']",,"In recent decades, the integration of optimization methods and Machine Learning (ML) models has garnered significant attention within the research community. In the pursuit of establishing a symbiotic relationship between ML and optimization algorithms, this study focuses on the fusion of the African Vulture Optimization Algorithm (AVOA) - an optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of African vultures - with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) - a prevalent model in ML for damage detection of a real large-scale bridge. In this research, AVOA, possessing a vast search space and the ability to autonomously adjust crucial parameters during the search process, such as flight velocity and learning rate, is employed to select informative features such as weight and biases of DNNs.

In this study, we selected two models: the Transformer model, which is suitable for large-scale data training through the self-attention mechanism, and the LSTM-based multi-state-vector sequence-to-sequence (LSTM-MSV-S2S) model with an encoder-decoder structure. These models were constructed to incorporate catchment attributes and predict the inflow of 10 multi-purpose dam watersheds in South Korea. The experimental design consisted of three training methods: Single-basin Training (ST), Pretraining (PT), and Pretraining-Finetuning (PT-FT). The input data for the models included 10 selected watershed attributes along with meteorological data. The inflow prediction performance was compared based on the training methods. The results showed that the Transformer model outperformed the LSTM-MSV-S2S model when using the PT and PT-FT methods, with the PT-FT method yielding the highest performance. The LSTM-MSV-S2S model showed better performance than the Transformer when using the ST method; however, it showed lower performance when using the PT and PT-FT methods. Additionally, the embedding layer activation vectors and raw catchment attributes were used to cluster watersheds and analyze whether the models learned the similarities between them. The Transformer model demonstrated improved performance among watersheds with similar activation vectors, proving that utilizing information from other pre-trained watersheds enhances the prediction performance. This study compared the suitable models and training methods for each multi-purpose dam and highlighted the necessity of constructing deep learning models using PT and PT-FT methods for domestic watersheds. Furthermore, the results confirmed that the Transformer model outperforms the LSTM-MSV-S2S model when applying PT and PT-FT methods."

However, because it's nearly impossible to precisely estimate the lifespan ofeach building due to the wide range of influencing factors, most studies have used uniform lifespans based on the building's primarystructural type. To address this limitation, 1,812,700 records were analyzed of buildings constructed and demolished in Korea to predict eachbuilding's lifespan with greater accuracy. Based on the previous study, a prediction model was developed using both deep learning andtraditional machine learning methods. This study evaluated whether the building lifespan prediction model experienced overfitting based on thedata period used to create the model. A performance evaluation was also conducted, comparing models using only key factors to those usinga broader set of factors. The results showed that among the machine learning models, the artificial neural network model, a nonlinearapproach, maintained high predictive accuracy without overfitting, regardless of the data period used. The model that used all available factorsperformed better than those based on just a few key factors. This research demonstrates the viability of using big data and AI for buildinglifespan prediction, providing a more reliable method for estimating building lifespan tailored to each building's unique characteristics. Thisapproach meets a growing societal demand for more accurate building lifespan predictions."

In the 2021 Coupang warehouse fire, the fire alarm sounded six times, but it was turned off by managers who thought it was a malfunction. The fire caused property damage valued at hundreds of billions of won. The malfunctioning of the fire detector caused a serious loss of trust in the fire detection platform. This paper proposes a reliable IoT fire detection service platform based on the AWS cloud environment, which collects field data through sensor clusters, builds a deep learning model to perform preliminary fire determination, and finally utilizes the Ensemble Method to determine the fire. When a fire occurs, the proposed system will notify safety managers, and they will be able to understand the situation through a digital twin and real-time video for a quick response. All situations are recorded in a log, which can be used for cause analysis and countermeasures. The proposed platform can greatly improve the accuracy and efficiency of fire detection, response, and management by converging cloud, sensor fusion, and deep learning technologies."

Sports analytics can be broadly categorized into on-field analytics and off-field analytics. Calls for systematic research identifying the current status of the sports analytics field are prevailing. However, it is difficult to find a study that systematically reviews sports analytics research that sheds light on the present and future of the field. In response to such research needs, the objective of this research is to conduct a systematic review on sports analytics presenting discourses on the future direction of the sports analytics field. This study collected all sports analytics-related studies published in domestic listed journals by utilizing various keywords such as “sports analytics,” “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” “data analysis,” and “sports analytics” in DBpia, Google Scholar, and Kyobo Scholar. We then systematically categorized the sports analytics studies that met the purpose of this study based on the consensus of three professional experts. As a result of the analysis, a total of 29 studies were found that analyzed actual match data, 23 studies analyzed discourse and trends, and 17 studies presented methodologies. In particular, the systematic categorization of studies that analyzed actual game data revealed that 1) the sports studied were heavily biased toward baseball and basketball, and 2) most of the studies were conducted only at the player and team level. Another limitation is that 3) the goal of the studies using AI algorithms is limited to predicting game outcomes or performance. Finally, 4) we found that more studies analyzing actual game data were published in non-sports journals than in sports-related journals. Based on these findings, this study systematically established and discussed eight recommendations. The significance of this study is that it examines the current status of sports analytics research and suggests the direction in which domestic sports industry and management-related research should move forward from the perspective of sports analytics."

Diabetes is a serious public health problem worldwide with the incidence of type 2 diabetes rapidly increasing. Traditionally diabetes prediction models have primarily considered genetic factors and lifestyle habits. However, recent studies have revealed that environmental factors also have a significant impact on the development of diabetes. In this study, we generate optimal diabetes incidence data using a GAN model and, with an LSTM model, use this data to predict the occurrence of diabetes. LSTM allows an efficient approach to the problem of diabetes disease prediction by learning features and identifying patterns in data indicative of diabetes, such as vital signs, biochemical indicators, and lifestyle choices. The results show that a deep learning model has excellent prediction performance and can make dynamic predictions by considering the impact of variables that change over time. Predictive models based on deep learning are expected to contribute significantly to early diabetes diagnoses and the development of personalized treatment strategies, helping diabetes patients manage their health."

However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of the echo signal due to multipath propagation of the signal, various clutter, ambient noise and reverberation makes it difficult to identify underwater targets using active sonar. Attempts have been made to apply data-based methods such as machine learning or deep learning to improve the performance of underwater target recognition systems, but it is difficult to collect enough data for training due to the nature of sonar datasets. Methods based on mathematical modeling have been mainly used to compensate for insufficient active sonar data. However, methodologies based on mathematical modeling have limitations in accurately simulating complex underwater phenomena. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a sonar signal synthesis method based on a deep neural network. In order to apply the neural network model to the field of sonar signal synthesis, the proposed method appropriately corrects the attention-based encoder and decoder to the sonar signal, which is the main module of the Tacotron model mainly used in the field of speech synthesis. It is possible to synthesize a signal more similar to the actual signal by training the proposed model using the dataset collected by arranging a simulated target in an actual marine environment. In order to verify the performance of the proposed method, Perceptual evaluation of audio quality test was conducted and within score difference –2.3 was shown compared to actual signal in a total of four different environments.

To solve this problem, tool life prediction models are being developed using the number of tool uses and wear records as labeling data, but it is difficult to collect tool wear data in industrial sites due to various machining conditions and product production interruptions. In addition, the number of tool uses can cause different tool wear degrees even if the number of uses is the same due to factors such as tool quality fluctuations and working environment temperature and humidity.

Method: A model is presented that combines fall discrimination rules with the results inferred from YOLOv8-pose, one of the top-down pose estimation models, and metrics of the model are evaluated for images of standing and falling two or fewer workers in the tunnel. The same process is also conducted for a bottom-up type of pose estimation model (OpenPose). In addition, due to dependency of the falling interference of the models on worker detection by YOLOv8-pose and OpenPose, metrics of the models for fall was not only investigated, but also for person. Result: For worker detection, both YOLOv8-pose and OpenPose models have F1-score of 0.88 and 0.71, respectively. However, for fall detection, the metrics were deteriorated to 0.71 and 0.23. The results of the OpenPose based model were due to partially detected worker body, and detected workers but fail to part them correctly. Conclusion: Use of top-down type of pose estimation models would be more effective way to detect fall of workers in the underground utility tunnel, with respect to joint recognition and partition between workers."

An improved fuzzy c-means method based on multivariate skew-normal distribution for brain MR image segmentation,2024,"['Multivariate skew-normal distribution', 'Fuzzy C-Means(FCM)', 'KL divergence', 'U-Net', 'Brain MR images.']",,"Accurate segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for providing doctors with effective quantitative information for diagnosis. However, the presence of weak boundaries, intensity inhomogeneity, and noise in the images poses challenges for segmentation models to achieve optimal results. While deep learning models can offer relatively accurate results, the scarcity of labeled medical imaging data increases the risk of overfitting. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel fuzzy c-means (FCM) model that integrates a deep learning approach. To address the limited accuracy of traditional FCM models, which employ Euclidean distance as a distance measure, we introduce a measurement function based on the skewed normal distribution. This function enables us to capture more precise information about the distribution of the image. Additionally, we construct a regularization term based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of high-confidence deep learning results. This regularization term helps enhance the final segmentation accuracy of the model. Moreover, we incorporate orthogonal basis functions to estimate the bias field and integrate it into the improved FCM method. This integration allows our method to simultaneously segment the image and estimate the bias field. The experimental results on both simulated and real brain MR images demonstrate the robustness of our method, highlighting its superiority over other advanced segmentation algorithms."

Thus, it is important for intrusion detection systems to report all intrusive behavior. Using deep learning and machine learning algorithms, intrusion detection systems are able to perform well in identifying attacks. However, the concern with these deep learning algorithms is their inability to identify a suitable network based on traffic volume, which requires manual changing of hyperparameters, which consumes a lot of time and effort. So, to address this, this paper offers a solution using the extended compact genetic algorithm for the automatic tuning of the hyperparameters. The novelty in this work comes in the form of modeling the problem of identifying attacks as a multi-objective optimization problem and the usage of linkage learning for solving the optimization problem. The solution is obtained using the feature map-based Convolutional Neural Network that gets encoded into genes, and using the extended compact genetic algorithm the model is optimized for the detection accuracy and latency. The CIC-IDS-2017 and 2018 datasets are used to verify the hypothesis, and the most recent analysis yielded a substantial F1 score of 99.23%. Response time, CPU, and memory consumption evaluations are done to demonstrate the suitability of this model in a fog environment."
Approach to diagnosing multiple abnormal events with single-event training data,2024,"['Nuclear power plant', 'Abnormal event diagnosis', 'Multi-label classification', 'Feature selection']",,"Diagnostic support systems are being researched to assist operators in identifying and responding to abnormal events in a nuclear power plant. Most studies to date have considered single abnormal events only, for which it is relatively straightforward to obtain data to train the deep learning model of the diagnostic support system. However, cases in which multiple abnormal events occur must also be considered, for which obtaining training data becomes difficult due to the large number of combinations of possible abnormal events. This study proposes an approach to maintain diagnostic performance for multiple abnormal events by training a deep learning model with data on single abnormal events only. The proposed approach is applied to an existing algorithm that can perform feature selection and multi-label classification. We choose an extremely randomized trees classifier to select dedicated monitoring parameters for target abnormal events. In diagnosing each event occurrence independently, two-channel convolutional neural networks are employed as sub-models. The algorithm was tested in a case study with various scenarios, including single and multiple abnormal events. Results demonstrated that the proposed approach maintained diagnostic performance for 15 single abnormal events and significantly improved performance for 105 multiple abnormal events compared to the base model."

After analyzing the skin type and detailed skin features of each area, a self-care program was proposed. A total of eight skin analysis items were measured, including skin type, pores, elasticity, pigmentation, UV pigmentation, sebum, porphyrin, and moisture.(Findings) The sebum secretion was categorized into oily, dry, and neutral, and the moisture secretion was categorized into hydrated, dehydrated, and hydrated. When analyzing the pore area ratio it was found that more cases were above the average for their age group, which is related to the fact that the skin type is more oily than dry. When analyzing the elasticity area ratio, it was found that more people were below the average for their age group, and 39.4% needed elasticity care above the average for their age group. The pigmentation area ratio shows that the highest percentage of people below the age group average is 54.5%, while the UV pigmentation area ratio is very high at 78.8% above the age group average. The porphyrin ratio was 66.7% above the age group average, which is believed to be due to more oily skin type subjects.(Research implications or Originality) The balance of oil and moisture is crucial for the skin to remain healthy and beautiful through its protective functions. For personalized skin care, it is important to accurately measure and diagnose the skin condition to analyze whether the oil-water balance is appropriate, and to identify pores, elasticity, pigmentation, sebum and water secretion. Compared to other ages, people in their 20s should focus on preventive skin care.

This study aims to develop an automated SSD detection system using deep learning models, leveraging their ability to transcribe audio, efficiently capture sound patterns on a vast scale, and address the limitations of traditional methods involving speech-language pathologists. For this study, we collected audio recordings from 573 children aged two to nine using standardized prompts from the Assessment of Phonology and Articulation for Children. Speech-language pathologists analyzed the recordings and identified 92 children with SSDs. To build an automatic SSD detection system, we used a dataset to train neural network models for automatic speech recognition and audio classification. Five different methods are studied, with the best method achieving 73.9% unweighted average recall.While the results show the potential of using deep learning models for the automatic detection of SSDs in children, further research is needed to improve the reliability of the models widely used in practice."
"RETRACTED ARTICLE: Determination of Power Transformer Fault’s Severity Based on Fuzzy Logic Model with GR, Level and DGA Interpretation",2024,['Transformer  · Duval Pentogan Method  · Harris Hawks Optimization  · Dissolved Gas analysis  · Gas Rate'],,"Transformer defects are defi ned by their severity which is the intrinsic property of the transformer. Several approaches for identifying the severity of Power Transformer (PT) problems have previously been proposed; however, most published research does not incorporate Gas Level (GL), Gas Rate (GR), and DGA interpretation into a unifi ed strategy. A novel technique in the form of fuzzy logic (FL) has been off ered as a new way to assess faults’ severity by utilizing the combination of GL, GR, and DGA interpretation from the Duval Pentagon Method (DPM) to increase the reliability of the faults’ severity evaluation of PT. Based on the local population, a four-level typical concentration and rate were created. A Deep Learning (DL) oriented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based DPM and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) method with a high agreement to that same graphical DPM has also been devised to enable the evaluation of hundreds of PT information easy. The proposed method was applied to 448 PTs, and it was then used to assess the severity of problems in PTs using historical DGA data. Due to the integration of GL, GR, and DGA interpretation results in one technique, this novel strategy yields good agreement with earlier methods, but with better sensitivity."

There are 153 types of mimetic words in the original text, and the number of times they appear is 396. As a result of analyzing the translation situation of Korean mimetic words, Google Translate omitted the most cases without preserving the meaning of the original text, and also had the most translation errors. In contrast, Baidu omitted fewer words than human translators, and its translation results were also the most similar to human translation. Through this, we can infer that among the three types of machine translators, Google Translate has the least amount of data because deep learning has not progressed as much as the other two translators for Korean mimetic words, while Baidu Translate has the most data because deep learning has progressed the most."

Microplastics can be detected by applying deep learning models to segment microscopic images. While it is important to avoid downsampling the data to improve accuracy, this usually requires an increase in model parameters and computation, making it difficult to operate in real-time on mobile devices. Therefore, to apply deep learning models to the process of instant microplastic detection from samplescollected in the field using mobile devices, a lightweight model is required while maintaining the resolution of the data. For the model lightweight experiment, we applied various existing lightweight methods to the convolution layer of U-Net, a representative model in the image segmentation field, and compared its performance with U-Net. The Depthwise Separable convolution layer shows mIoU performance that is comparable to that of U-Net, with 82.6% less computation. In addition, the Matrix Factorization and Group convolution layers show 99.55% less computation, although there is a 7.41% mIoU performance drop compared to U-Net.

Various approaches have been attempted in personal credit loan default prediction research, from statistical methods to machine learning, and recently, deep learning methods such as multilayer perceptron have been applied. However, multilayer perceptron does not reflect contextual information between input variables, so it does not show improvement in prediction performance compared to existing machine learning methods. In this study, in order to overcome the shortcomings of the existing multilayer perceptron methodology, the Transformer methodology, which is mainly used in the natural language processing field, was applied to the problem of personal credit loan default prediction, and as a result, it was confirmed that it showed an improvement in prediction performance compared to the existing deep learning and showed the same level of prediction performance as the XGBoost methodology, an ensemble-based decision tree with the best prediction performance among previous methods. The implication of this study is that the Transformer methodology, which is mainly used in natural language processing, can be effective in the problem of predicting personal credit loan defaults using tabular data consisting of various variables. This suggests that, compared to existing traditional modeling techniques, Transformer can better capture complex interactions between high-dimensional data and improve prediction performance.

It is analyzed and suggested that the Buddhist system of thinking in the Samje Weonyung(三諦圓融) is in close contact with the ideology of the Tao Te Ching and the Bayes Theorem, one of the learning algorithms of artificial intelligence. This is an attempt to explore the convergent implications of the Buddhist way of thinking inherent in the scriptures represented by Yeosiamun(如是我聞), that is to say, from the current perspective, it is an attempt to reconstruct the view of the Hearing(聞) of Yeosiamun(如是我聞) into the wheel of the dharmacakra-pravartana(如是我轉) in line with the innovation of modern science and technology, as well as to reveal the strategic value of the Middle Path with the manifestation of Yeosiajeon(如是我顯).Based on those recognition, this study newly present the strategic value of the Buddhist thinking system from two perspectives. First, by revealing that in light of Chapter 1 of the Tao Te Ching, the Tao(道) is referred to as having the characteristics of Ga(可), and it is clarified that Tao's properties are variable, and that Tao operates as a significant interdependence between Mu(無) as a potential world and Yu(有) as a phenomenal world. In this way, it is judged that the principle of operation of Tao(道), which works as an interdependence between Mu(無) and Yu(有), can be easily passed on as a thinking system of the Samje Weonyung(三諦圓融). Tao(道) is defined as a Ga(可), that is, change itself, which is equivalent to the principle of Muwi-MuBulwi(無爲無不爲). It is reasonable to estimate that it also can be interpreted as the three principles of the Middle Path that play a major rule as a strategic framework for the Buddhist thinking system.Second, Bays Theorem, one of the AI algorithms defined as another consciousness, is also a decision-making theory that abandons subjectivity and moves toward objectivity, not just a computer operating system. It has been shown that the process can be subsumed into the three principles of the Middle Path in that it is a learning method that constantly modifies the intellectual system of consciousness based on observation, data, and events. The reasoning of this paper is that the prior probability of Bays Theorem can be represented as a framework for divided thinking, and that the total probability can be determined as a Gong(空), the likelihood probability as a Ga(假), and the posterior probability as a Jung(中). It can be said that it is a process of dismantling the discriminated cognition system caused by the fixed frame and fringe limitations through Gong(空), presenting an updated direction based on this, and realizing the Middle Path. It can be confirmed that the same mechanism of operation as AI's deep learning and reinforcement learning methods interact with the Middle Path thinking system."

This study focuses on anthropogenic sources and examines the principles of methane detection using information from various spectral bands, including the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band, and the utilization of key satellite data supporting these technologies. Recently, deep learning techniques have been applied in methane detection research using satellite data, contributing to more accurate analyses of methane emissions. Furthermore, this paper assesses the practicality of satellite-based methane monitoring by synthesizing case studies of methane emission detection at global, regional, and major incident scales, including examples of applying deep learning techniques. At the global scale, research utilizing satellite sensors like the Sentinel-5P TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) was reviewed.

As deep learning technology has become widely disseminated, access to deepfake technology has increased, resulting in a rise in crimes exploiting it. Consequently, there is a growing need for effective deepfake detection technologies. Deepfake generation primarily occurs through two methods: identity swap and facial reenactment. Existing detection technologies exhibit performance variations depending on the method of deepfake generation. This study aims to propose a research approach that addresses the limitations of existing methodologies by reducing the performance disparity of deepfake detection models. The proposed model first cuts a video into frame-by-frame images, then extracts the face area, which is the main target of deepfakes, and the mouth area, which can be considered a type of local information, and utilizes them as multi-scale features. By inputting each feature into different vision transformer structures and integrating the resulting predictions, the model effectively determines whether a video is a deepfake. Specifically, the face area helps address identity swap deepfakes, while the mouth area assists in handling facial reenactment deepfakes, thereby endowing the model with robustness against different deepfake generation methods. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the proposed method’s relatively high detection performance and its potential for more generalizable response to various deepfake generation methods."

First, we perform pseudo-LiDAR generation and log-scale intensityreconstruction using camera images. Log-scale intensity reconstruction includes distance-related patterns, so thatthe learning model can learn spatial structures and distance information between objects more effectively. Second,we augment the point cloud by fusion of pseudo-LiDAR and LiDAR to fill in the low-resolution or undetected areasof LiDAR with pseudo-LiDAR points, thereby increasing the overall number of points and clearly expressing theoutline of the object. The augmented point cloud provides more points and various features, and the PV-RCNNmodel can effectively utilize them. In order to evaluate the objective reliability of the proposed technique, wecompared the performance with other deep learning models by calculating mAP using the KITTI dataset. Theexperimental results show that the performance of 3D object detection using the camera+LiDAR-based point cloudaugmentation technique proposed in this paper is superior to that of existing methods. In particular, mAPincreased by about 0.37 compared to PV-RCNN, which was used as a learning model. The efficiency of thetechnique proposed in this paper was proven as it showed excellent results in the experiment."

With the rapid development of AI technology, there is a growing number of multi-modal based systems that synthesize different types of data to produce results. In this paper, we present an AI system that uses speech and text recognition to describe a person and generate a montage image. While the existing montage generation technology is based on the appearance of Westerners, the montage generation system developed in this paper learns a model based on Korean facial features. Therefore, it is possible to create more accurate and effective Korean montage images based on multi-modal voice and text specific to Korean. Since the developed montage generation app can be utilized as a draft montage, it can dramatically reduce the manual labor of existing montage production personnel. For this purpose, we utilized persona-based virtual person montage data provided by the AI-Hub of the National Information Society Agency. AI-Hub is an AI integration platform aimed at providing a one-stop service by building artificial intelligence learning data necessary for the development of AI technology and services. The image generation system was implemented using VQGAN, a deep learning model used to generate high-resolution images, and the KoDALLE model, a Korean-based image generation model. It can be confirmed that the learned AI model creates a montage image of a face that is very similar to what was described using voice and text. To verify the practicality of the developed montage generation app, 10 testers used it and more than 70% responded that they were satisfied. The montage generator can be used in various fields, such as criminal detection, to describe and image facial features."

With technological advancements, it is developing into a form of predictive maintenance that uses AI techniques to diagnose failures and take proactive measures. In this paper, a study was conducted to diagnose fan motor failure in semiconductor chamber-type equipment, and a failure diagnosis method was studied using vibration signals using AI techniques through similar data sets. First, in previous research, failure was predicted using three models (DNN, RNN, CNN) using artificial intelligence deep learning techniques, and the four vibration signals were expanded to 19 through feature engineering to compare failure predictions using the same three models. Through analysis, the performance of the model algorithm was improved. In addition, most AI research studies failure diagnosis methodologies through batch-level time series data. Since semiconductor production sites are equipment that operates 24 hours a day, normal data is learned using streaming real-time data, and when abnormal data is detected, the autoencoder technique is used to classify it as a failure, to verify performance and diagnose failures. was studied. The implication of this study is that it is a step forward from research on improving algorithm performance using typical artificial intelligence techniques, and has progressed to improve performance through feature engineering. We visualized failure prediction by incorporating an autoencoder algorithm that can be actually applied in industrial sites, predicted anomaly scores by learning normal states, and analyzed the differences when abnormal data occurs to verify that failure prediction is possible. In addition, since abnormal data can be predicted using normal learning data, outliers can be graded by grade based on the maximum Anomaly Score of normal learning data. It can be used to implement a predictive maintenance system that can classify the maintenance status of facilities into normal operation, monitoring status, and maintenance status."

In the past, personal information was recognized as a subject to be protected through regulation rather than a subject to be promoted for the purpose of creating industrial added value. In addition, related laws were legislated in a way that controlled the distribution of data containing personal information in order to protect the privacy of citizens from infringements such as leakage, misuse, and abuse of personal information, and to guarantee the rights and interests of information subjects regarding personal information. In this way, personal information tended to be regulated as a subject of protection and control in existing related laws. However, now that generative AI has had a real impact on society as a general-purpose AI, a movement to recognize data as a property right is beginning, and interest is shifting to the development of various laws to return the added value obtained from the distribution of personal information to the information subjects and activate the actual use of data.Artificial intelligence technology is overcoming the second winter and undergoing technological evolution such as deep learning and generative AI. AlphaGo's victory in the past Go match against Lee Sedol briefly demonstrated the development of artificial intelligence technology and attracted the attention of many people, but AlphaGo's victory in the Go match did not directly lead to economic profit generation. Through this match, Google demonstrated the development of deep learning technology, and the world was amazed, but this technology was not developed into a product or sold to create economic added value and provide profits to Google. However, with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, products utilizing artificial intelligence technology in various industries have been developed and commercialized, creating tangible economic added value. As generative artificial intelligence represented by ChetGPT is commercialized as general-purpose artificial intelligence, a new phase of transition is occurring in which artificial intelligence technology can create tangible economic added value in the industrial sector. Eventually, as the acquisition and distribution of high-quality data, comparable to oil in the Industrial Revolution era, became recognized as key requirements for the actual success of new industries, the concept of the information subject's right to self-determination of personal information, which started out as a means of protecting personal information, expanded into the concept of distributing high-quality data and securing industrial data through it, and is now receiving renewed attention.The right to self-determination of personal information, which is also a key concept in the return of added value obtained through data containing personal information, was conceptualized to recognize individuals as legal information subjects with independent decision-making rights over their own information in response to the need for personal information protection as data containing personal information was utilized commercially and administratively as the data economy began in earnest. The right to self-determination of personal information was first discussed for the purpose of protecting personal information, but as data became recognized as a key resource in the production of industrial added value, it is now receiving recognition as a promotion perspective to eliminate data monopolies and return the added value produced through data distribution to individuals so that high-quality data can be utilized more actively throughout the industry.Thus, it is necessary to establish a return system in which the added value obtained through the distribution and use of personal information can be returned to the information subject by expanding the concept of the ..."

This dynamic service platform serves as a vehicle mobility terminal as a merged middleware layer between the control and data modules. In this vehicle mobility terminal, the in-vehicle component constituting the cross-service was fused with the dynamic service as a data module connected to the brake and engine, and the external system was modularized and designed. A study of these modularized services for external systems linked to in-vehicle vehicle diagnosis, management services, and service expansion modularized by dynamic services was presented. Currently, the modular service is created, deleted, updated, driven, and stopped when converting the data and service modules. It is also applied in real time to the framework. First, the personalized service distribution model design required for the vehicle convergence service terminal was applied. Second, we presented a user-centered CAN-based TDCSI(Thin Device Customer Service Interface) for the minimum resource use of embedded systems. Third, a UDP-based generative web service optimization model was constructed. These module configurations interact with communication service and data modules inside the vehicle in one direction, two directions, and user demand directions, respectively, so scenarios can be reflected as a life cycle process according to changes in external service requirements. The life cycle model is linked to various application services transmitted between vehicle external systems for data generated inside the vehicle. This structure that can be recycled in an ultra-large deep learning data platform because it can be classified by class, type, and situation.

In this paper, we propose an efficient license plate recognition system that achieves high recognition accuracy while ensuring real-time recognition. In order to achieve high detection accuracy while minimizing computational effort in the license plate detection stage, we propose a lightweight cross stage partial dilated convolution (CSPDC) network. Firstly, we propose a lightweight downsampling design that reduces the computational effort of downsampling while retaining important feature information. Secondly, we introduce a lightweight feature extraction network that reduces computational effort and parameter count while maintaining the network’s feature extraction capability. Finally, to prevent a decrease in detection performance after lightweight processing, we propose a cross stage partial dilated block that expands the receptive field of feature extraction to enhance the network’s learning capability. Experimental results on the CCPD dataset demonstrate that our proposed system achieves a tradeoff between computational effort and accuracy, with an ACC of 99.3% and a detection speed of 89 FPS. We further deployed and tested our algorithm on the Huawei M6 tablet, and the test results shows the practical value of our proposed method."

This is especially true in supply chain management, where the relationship between suppliers and buyers plays a huge role in determining how efficiently a business runs and how profitable it can be. Traditionally, companies have relied on long-established  networks  and  past  relationships  when  selecting  partners. However, this  approach  can  be  limiting, as  it  often overlooks new opportunities due to gaps in information or preconceived biases. To tackle this challenge, the authors of the study introduced a new model based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN).

This capability allows each head to concurrently process its own set of tokens, integrating diverse information from the input sequence. However, previous studies have shown that not all heads learn valuable and distinct features from each other, instead only a few selected heads prove significant. This does not align with the purpose of multi-head attention, therefore, in this paper, we redesign the multi-head attention mechanism to ensure each head focuses on different features of the input, promoting the capture of unique, non-overlapping features. This approach allows all heads to contribute effectively during the inference stage. Additionally, we introduce a head mixing strategy to enhance information aggregation between heads, thereby enabling richer predictions. Finally, as our method allows each multi-head to attend different segments of the input, we achieve memory and computational savings proportional to the number of heads."

To analyze the classification results according to augmentation timing, we partition the augmentation timing into the pre-processing timing and the epoch timing. Subsequently, we compare the classification accuracy across these distinct timings to discern their impact on the results. Implementing the suggested random phase transformation augmentation technique at the epoch timing revealed an average accuracy enhancement of roughly 2% compared to augmentation at the pre-processing timing. Notably, this improvement was achieved using fewer data points in practical applications. Furthermore, it becomes evident that the selection and utilization of the optimal combination of phase values yield an additional enhancement in classification accuracy, surpassing 6%.

Conventional vehicle license plate recognition systems have relied on images obtained from fixed surveillance cameras for traffic detection to perform vehicle detection, tracking, and license plate recognition.However, during this process, image quality degradation occurred due to the physical distance between the camera and the vehicle, vehicle movement, and external environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions. In particular, the acquisition of low-resolution images due to camera performance limitations has been a major cause of significantly reduced accuracy in license plate recognition. To solve this problem, we propose a Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) model with a parallel structure that combines Multi-Scale and Attention Mechanism. This model is capable of effectively extracting features at various scales and focusing on important areas. Specifically, it generates feature maps of various sizes through a multi-branch structure and emphasizes the key features of license plates using an Attention Mechanism.

To ensure complete contact between the test pins and the semiconductor, the pin is equipped with a spring, allowing the structure on both sides of the spring to be compressed and then released repeatedly.

IS-YOLO: A YOLOv7-based Detection Method for Small Ship Detection in Infrared Images With Heterogeneous Backgrounds,2024,"['Deep learning', 'infrared image', 'maritime', 'small ship detection.']",,"Ship detection from infrared images occupies an important role in maritime search and tracking applications. When compared with methods to process daytime RGB photos, processing infrared images has challenges due to the reduced signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR), indistinct outlines, and inadequate spatial resolutions. In addition, the detection of small targets remains challenging owing to their size variations and unclear edges, leading to missed detections and low accuracy. This work suggests the use of infrared-ship YOLO (IS-YOLO), a model to recognize small ships in infrared images. The proposed technique, based on YOLOv7, enhances the ability to detect infrared objects in heterogeneous scenarios. First, we improve the ability of the YOLOv7 backbone to extract features by introducing a new structure for the efficient layer aggregation network (ELAN) with a two convolutions and GhostConv module. Secondly, the max pooling pyramid-ELAN is introduced to integrate multi-scale information. Furthermore, we capture an infrared small ship dataset using the FLIR T620 camera. The experimental results demonstrate that the IS-YOLO model had the best performance in small ship detection from infrared images compared to several state-of-the-art models, as shown by optimal metrics that include average precision (AP@.5, AP@.5:.95, the number of parameters, and the model size): AP@.5, 88.9%; AP@.5:.95, 38.2%; 32.8 M; and 63.1 Mb, respectively.

However, if the probability distribution of general softmax, which changes the weight of selected classes into a probability distribution, is applied to the ensemble as it is, the probability of the class with the highest weight becomes too high value because of the effect of the exponential function in softmax, which reduces the effectiveness of the ensemble. In this paper, we propose smoothed softmax which introduces a smoothing factor to alleviate the problem of softmax, and show that the ensemble performance can be improved. The paper also shows that smoothed softmax improves the accuracy of the neural network when a neural network trained with coarse labels is included in the ensemble, and the ensemble is used as a teacher model to distill knowledge into a small-sized student model neural network. Compared to the conventional softmax, the smoothed softmax proposed in the paper increased the accuracy by 1.38% when it is ensembled with a neural network trained with fine labels, increased the accuracy by 5.21% when a neural network trained with coarse labels was added to the ensemble, and increased the accuracy by up to 7.0% when the ensemble neural network was reduced in size through knowledge distillation."

This model, upon receiving a image, searches for the vanishing point, then identifies the type based on the location of the vanishing point, and conveys information helpful to the depth estimation model. Inference of the vanishing point position first involves extracting the outlines from a image using the Canny edge detector, then retaining only the line components through Hough transformation. These lines are then extended to determine the vanishing point as the area where the most line intersections occur. The types of vanishing point positions are classified into three categories, and the self-attention mechanism of SW-MSA varies according to the type. The performance of the proposed model demonstrates better results than the existing monocular depth estimation models, as shown by experimental result. This paper emphasizes the use of  technology that identifies the intrinsic characteristics of an image by estimatioing monocular depth through the geometric feature of vanishing points, thereby not relying on training data. This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of depth estimation, emphasizing the potential of the technology by utilizing the concept of vanishing points from perspective in depth estimation."

In order to efficiently transmit multimedia traffic, it is very important to effectively set up a multicast routing tree that determines the route from one sender to multiple receivers. In this paper, we propose an efficient multicast routing tree generation method using PEARL, one of the meta-RL models, considering the variable network environment. Meta-RL is a technique that can learn various tasks and is suitable for variable network environments, and PEARL is a context-based meta-RL technique with high sample efficiency compared to conventional meta-RL. To measure the performance of the proposed method in a variable network environment, we experimented with random, 30%, 50% and 70% link distributions. The experimental results show that the performance of the model trained by the proposed method is 1.184, which can generate a near-optimal multicast routing tree."
Intelligent Recognition System of Dangerous  Behaviors Among the Elderly People,2024,"['Behaviors Reconstruction', 'Deep Learning', 'Intelligent Nurse']",,"Clinical data shows that the mortality rate of elderly patients with spinal fractures within one year ranges from 10% to 30%, with a disability rate as high as 50%. More than 50% of falls among elderly people occur in homes that are considered relatively safe, with falls mostly occurring during the morning hours of the day. This trend reminds us that when paying attention to the safety of the elderly, we need to pay special attention to the safety of the family environment and the supervision during the daytime. In this paper, Based on You Only Look Ones (YOLOv8) model infrastructure, combined with deep neck structure and simplified head structure, the system can build high detection accuracy and real-time performance, so that the system can timely detect dangerous behaviors of the elderly people, such as falls. Improve the detection of dangerous behaviors such as falls in real-time and accuracy, which helps reduce the risk of injury caused by delayed detection and treatment, and improve the quality of life of the elderly people. Especially when the elderly live alone or lack the care of guardians, the system can become an ""AI alarm"" and provide all-weather security guard. Experiments show that the detection response time of the system is 275 fps, and the recall rate is 90.2%. And it is linked with the face and behavior identification system, the medical record intelligent matching system of the medical institution, the alarm information transmission system of the communication institution, and the information sharing system of the emergency institution to achieve the emergency response of the elderly who fall at the minute level."

However, sentiment indices, being based on survey methods, have limitations in terms of coverage, availability timing, and temporal and economic costs. To complement these limitations, this paper develops the Supplementary Composite Consumer Sentiment Index(S-CCSI) using KB-BERT embeddings and DNN. The utility of the S-CCSI as a supplementary index is verified through comparative analysis with sentiment indices and comparison of GDP economic growth rate forecasting capabilities. The results show that the S-CCSI leads the BSI and ESI by approximately 1-2 months, and exhibits a high correlation with these indices. Furthermore, when utilizing the S-CCSI, it was confirmed that the performance of GDP economic growth rate forecasting is generally higher. This suggests that the S-CCSI is a reliable index and can be utilized for economic forecasting."

To address the issue, a grayscale-based deepfake detection method has recently been proposed. This method significantly reduces detection time while providing comparable accuracy to RGB-based methods. However, despite its significant effectiveness, the “key components” that directly affect the performance of grayscale-based deepfake detection have not been systematically analyzed. In this paper, we target three key components: RGB-to-grayscale conversion method, brightness level in grayscale, and resolution level in grayscale. To analyze their impacts on the performance of grayscale-based deepfake detection, we conducted comprehensive evaluations, including component-wise analysis and comparative analysis using real-world datasets. For each key component, we quantitatively analyzed its characteristics’ performance and identified differences between them. Moreover, we successfully verified the effectiveness of an optimal combination of the key components by comparing it with existing deepfake detection methods."

A Dynamic Head Gesture Recognition Method for Real-time Intention Inference and Its Application to Visual Human-robot Interaction,2024,"['Computer vision', 'deep learning', 'head gesture', 'human-robot interaction.']",,"Head gesture is a natural and non-verbal communication method for human-computer and human-robot interaction, conveying attitudes and intentions. However, the existing vision-based recognition methods cannot meet the precision and robustness of interaction requirements. Due to the limited computational resources, applying most high-accuracy methods to mobile and onboard devices is challenging. Moreover, the wearable device-based approach is inconvenient and expensive. To deal with these problems, an end-to-end two-stream fusion network named TSIR3D is proposed to identify head gestures from videos for analyzing human attitudes and intentions. Inspired by Inception and ResNet architecture, the width and depth of the network are increased to capture motion features sufficiently. Meanwhile, convolutional kernels are expanded from the spatial domain to the spatiotemporal domain for temporal feature extraction. The fusion position of the two-stream channel is explored under an accuracy/complexity trade-off to a certain extent. Furthermore, a dynamic head gesture dataset named DHG and a behavior tree are designed for human-robot interaction. Experimental results show that the proposed method has advantages in real-time performance on the remote server or the onboard computer. Furthermore, its accuracy on the DHG can surpass most state-of-the-art vision-based methods and is even better than most previous approaches based on head-mounted sensors. Finally, TSIR3D is applied on Pepper Robot equipped with Jetson TX2."

However, CT studies are associated with logistical problems, acquisition costs, and radiation exposure. In this proof-of-concept study, the feasibility of generating synthetic spinal CT images using biplanar radiographs was explored. This could expand the potential applications of x-ray machines pre-, post-, and even intraoperatively.Methods: A cohort of 209 patients who underwent spinal CT imaging from the VerSe2020 dataset was used to train the algorithm. The model was subsequently evaluated using an internal and external validation set containing 55 from the VerSe2020 dataset and a subset of 56 images from the CTSpine1K dataset, respectively. Digitally reconstructed radiographs served as input for training and evaluation of the 2-dimensional (2D)-to-3-dimentional (3D) generative adversarial model. Model performance was assessed using peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and cosine similarity (CS).Results: At external validation, the developed model achieved a PSNR of 21.139 ± 1.018 dB (mean ± standard deviation). The SSIM and CS amounted to 0.947 ± 0.010 and 0.671 ± 0.691, respectively.Conclusion: Generating an artificial 3D output from 2D imaging is challenging, especially for spinal imaging, where x-rays are known to deliver insufficient information frequently.Although the synthetic CT scans derived from our model do not perfectly match their ground truth CT, our proof-of-concept study warrants further exploration of the potential of this technology."

The signed distance function was used to convert missile geometry to image data with various resolutions. Aerodynamic dataset was generated by using Missile DATCOM. To check the uncertainty due to the randomness of trained deep neural network models, box plots of prediction errors from independently trained multiple mod- els were generated and compared. Grad-CAM was used to provide explainability to missile conﬁguration images. It was conﬁrmed that predictions of the neural network model become robust as the size of dataset increases. MINN1, which only uses image resolution of whole missile geometry was found to be unable to accurately predict effects of the nose type on axial force. Therefore, the missile nose type information was explicitly provided to the second input layer in MINN2. Then, a CNN classiﬁcation model was developed for nose type prediction using signed distance function image around the missile nose. The accuracy of the nose type classiﬁcation CNN model was 100% for 642 or higher input image resolutions. CNN + MINN2 architecture, which provides MINN2 with the predicted nose type by the CNN model, was built and compared with MINN1 and MINN2. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) was also used for comparison with the MINN models as a reference.Both MINN2 and CNN + MINN2 are conﬁrmed to be very accurate having relative errors less than 5%."

However, the depth map obtained from the RGB-D camera tends to rapidly lose accuracy as the distance increases, and therefore, it is required to develop alternative method to improve the VIO performance in wide environments. In this paper, we argue that leveraging depth map estimated from a deep neural network has benefits to state estimation. To improve the reliability of depth information utilized in VIO algorithm, we propose a kernel-based sampling strategy to filter out depth values with low confidence. The proposed method aims to improve the robustness and accuracy of VIO algorithms by selectively utilizing reliable values of estimated depth maps. Experiments were conducted on real-world custom dataset acquired from underground parking lot environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to improve the performance of VIO, exhibiting potential for the use of depth estimation network for state estimation."

"""ATT-NestedUnet : Sugar Beet and Weed Detection using Semantic Segmentation""",2024,"['ATT-NestedUNet', 'Deep learning', 'Weed detection', 'Semantic Segmentation', 'Sugarbeet']",,"Sugar beet is a biennial herb with cold, drought, and salinity resistance and is one of the world's major sugar crops. In addition to sugar, sugar beets are important raw materials for chemical and pharmaceutical products, and the residue after sugar extraction can be used to produce agricultural by-products, such as compound feed, which has a high comprehensive utilization value [1]. Field weeds, such as sugar beets, are harmful to crop growth and can compete with crops for sunlight and nutrients. If weeds are not removed in time during crop growth, they cause a decrease in crop yield and quality. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the development of automated machinery for selective weeding operations. The core component of this technology is a vision system that distinguishes between crops and weeds. To address the problems of difficult weed extraction, poor detection, and segmentation of  region boundaries in traditional sugar beet detection, an end-to-end encoder–decoder model based on an improved UNet++ for segmentation is proposed in this paper and applied to sugar beet and weed detection. UNet++ can better fuse feature maps from different layers by skipping connections and can effectively preserve the details of sugar beet and weed images. The new model adds an attention mechanism to UNet++ by embedding the attention module into the upsampling process of UNet++ to suppress interference from extraneous noise. The improved model was evaluated on a sugar beet and weed dataset containing 1026 images. The image dataset in this study was obtained from sugar beet and weed images collected at the University of Bonn, Germany. According to the experimental results, the model can significantly eliminate noise and improve segmentation accuracy"
Multi-Class Multi-Object Tracking in Aerial Images Using Uncertainty Estimation,2024,"['Detection', 'Tracking', 'Uncertainty', 'Deep learning']",,"Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a vital component in understanding the surrounding environ -ments. Previous research has demonstrated that MOT can successfully detect and track surroundingobjects. Nonetheless, inaccurate classification of the tracking objects remains a challenge that needs to besolved. When an object approaching from a distance is recognized, not only detection and tracking butalso classification to determine the level of risk must be performed. However, considering the erroneousclassification results obtained from the detection as the track class can lead to performance degradationproblems. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of classification in tracking under the classificationuncertainty of the detector. To address this problem, a class update module is proposed, which leveragesthe class uncertainty estimation of the detector to mitigate the classification error of the tracker. Weevaluated our approach on the VisDrone-MOT2021 dataset, which includes multi-class and uncertain far-distance object tracking. We show that our method has low certainty at a distant object, and quicklyclassifies the class as the object approaches and the level of certainty increases. In this manner, our methodoutperforms previous approaches across different detectors. In particular, the You Only Look Once(YOLO)v8 detector shows a notable enhancement of 4.33 multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) incomparison to the previous state-of-the-art method.

Traditional methods, such as the Gardner grading system, rely on subjective human assessment of morphological features, leading to potential inconsistencies and errors. Artificial intelligence-powered grading systems offer a more objective and consistent approach by reducing human biases and enhancing accuracy and reliability.Methods: We evaluated the performance of five convolutional neural network architectures—EfficientNet-B0, InceptionV3, ResNet18, ResNet50, and VGG16— in grading blastocysts into five quality classes using only embryo images, without incorporating clinical or patient data. Transfer learning was applied to adapt pretrained models to our dataset, and data augmentation techniques were employed to improve model generalizability and address class imbalance.Results: EfficientNet-B0 outperformed the other architectures, achieving the highest accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and F1-score across all evaluation metrics. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping was used to interpret the models’ decision-making processes, revealing that the most successful models predominantly focused on the inner cell mass, a critical determinant of embryo quality.Conclusions: Convolutional neural networks, particularly EfficientNet-B0, can significantly enhance the reliability and consistency of embryo grading in in vitro fertilization procedures by providing objective assessments based solely on embryo images.

Blockchain-Enabled Lightweight Intrusion Detection System for Secure MANETs,2024,['Actor-critic network  · Reinforcement learning  · Hybrid authentication  · MANET'],,"In this study, we provide a novel method dubbed BL-IDS, which makes use of a decentralized Blockchain network to power a minimal intrusion detection system (IDS) for MANETs. The unique infrastructure-less nature of MANETs poses challenges in developing an eff ective and reliable IDS. Our proposed solution addresses these challenges by incorporating several key elements. First, we employ a hybrid authentication mechanism to authenticate network nodes, ensuring a secure environment. Authenticated nodes are then allowed to form clusters based on a similarity index (SI), facilitating effi cient communication and routing within the network. To optimize routing, we introduce the wild horse optimization algorithm, which considers multiple metrics to select the most optimal route. To detect and mitigate intrusions, we propose the deep actor-critic learning (DAC) approach. This algorithm learns features from network packets through the Blockchain, which serves as a monitoring system for data transmission. If an intrusion is detected, the DAC algorithm updates the network with feedback, enabling prompt response and resolution.

ELS options present significant challenges due to their intricate payoff structure and path-dependent nature. We experimented with two types of ELS options: stepdown knock-in and knockout options. The DeepBSDE model shows similar results to those of classical methods like Monte Carlo method and Finite Difference method, but with distinct advantages. While Monte Carlo method provides only the options value without any additional information such as the value of Greeks, and while Finite Difference method offers comprehensive domain information but struggles with multi-dimensional problems, DeepBSDE avoids the curse of dimensionality, making it more practical for usage in multi-asset options.

Among these, EfficientNetB2 exhibited superior performance in lateral view segmentation, achieving a mean Intersection-over-union (m-IoU) of 94.19%. To further enhance segmentation accuracy, attention mechanisms such as Squeeze and Excitation (SE), Residual connection-infused Squeeze and Excitation (SER), Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and Residual connection-infused Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAMR) were incorporated into the DeepLabV3 + model.Results The introduction of attention mechanisms in the EfficientNetB2 model led to enhanced m-IoU values: SE (94.27%), SER (94.25%), CBAM (94.59%), and CBAMR (94.66%). EfficientNetB2, integrated with CBAM and Residual connections (termed CBAMR), found to be top-performing model, achieving m-IoU values of 94.66% (lateral view), 93.77% (posterior view), and 99.61% (stature). The lateral view segmentation demonstrated high IoU for the body (98.73%) and rump (96.54%), with lowest IoU for teats (79.70%) due to their smaller spatial presence in input image. For posterior view regions, the CBAMR model achieved IoU scores above 79.0%, with the rear leg showing the highest (96.70%) and rump bones the lowest (79.52%). The segmentation accuracy for stature exceeded 90.0%, indicating less complexity in single-body region segmentation.Conclusions Therefore, these developed models demonstrate considerable accuracy in segmenting cow regions, making a significant contribution to the advancement of computer vision–based systems for measuring linear-type traits, and hold promise for deployment in such an automatic system."

Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model and Colorization based Image Compression,2024,"['Colorization', 'Image Compression', 'Deep Learning', 'Denoising Diffusion', 'Null Space']",,"Image compression-decompression methods have become increasingly crucial in modern times, facilitating the transfer of high-quality images while minimizing file size and internet traffic. Historically, early image compression relied on rudimentary codecs, aiming to compress and decompress data with minimal loss of image quality. Recently, a novel compression framework leveraging colorization techniques has emerged. These methods, originally developed for infusing grayscale images with color, have found application in image compression, leading to colorization-based coding. Within this framework, the encoder plays a crucial role in automatically extracting representative pixels-referred to as color seeds-and transmitting them to the decoder. The decoder, utilizing colorization methods, reconstructs color information for the remaining pixels based on the transmitted data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to image compression, wherein we decompose the compression task into grayscale image compression and colorization tasks. Unlike conventional colorization-based coding, our method focuses on the colorization process rather than the extraction of color seeds. Moreover, we employ the Denoising Diffusion Null-Space Model (DDNM) for colorization, ensuring high-quality color restoration and contributing to superior compression rates. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher-quality decompressed images compared to standard JPEG and JPEG2000 compression schemes, particularly in high compression rate scenarios."

A Method for Generating Malware Countermeasure Samples Based on Pixel Attention Mechanism,2024,"['Malware', 'Generative Adversarial Networks', 'Deep Learning', 'Pixel Attention Mechanism', 'Adversarial Samples']",,"Studies have shown that malware has become a primary means of attacking the Internet. Therefore, adversarial samples have become a vital breakthrough point for studying malware. By studying adversarial samples, we can gain insights into the behavior and characteristics of malware, evaluate the performance of existing detectors in the face of deceptive samples, and help to discover vulnerabilities and improve detection methods for better performance. However, existing adversarial sample generation methods still need help regarding escape effectiveness and mobility. For instance, researchers have attempted to incorporate perturbation methods like Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and others into adversarial samples to obfuscate detectors. However, these methods are only effective in specific environments and yield limited evasion effectiveness. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a malware adversarial sample generation method (PixGAN) based on the pixel attention mechanism, which aims to improve adversarial samples' escape effect and mobility. The method transforms malware into grey-scale images and introduces the pixel attention mechanism in the Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) model to weigh the critical pixels in the grey-scale map, which improves the modeling ability of the generator and discriminator, thus enhancing the escape effect and mobility of the adversarial samples. The escape rate (ASR) is used as an evaluation index of the quality of the adversarial samples. The experimental results show that the adversarial samples generated by PixGAN achieve escape rates of 97%, 94%, 35%, 39%, and 43% on the Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network (CNN_RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory (CNN_LSTM) algorithmic detectors, respectively."

This study compared the performances of the Transformer speech recognition model and its enhanced versions, the Conformer and E-Branchformer, when applied to Korean speech recognition. Using Korean speech data from AIHub, we prepared a training set of approximately 7,500 hours and evaluated the models using the ESPnet toolkit. Additionally, we compared syllables and subwords as recognition units and analyzed the performance differences with changes in the number of tokens using Byte Pair Encoding. The results showed that the E-Branchformer achieved the best performance in Korean speech recognition and Conformer outperformed Transformer but degraded in performance for long utterances owing to cross-attention alignment errors. We aimed to determine the optimal settings by analyzing the performance changes with subword token adjustments.This study comprehensively evaluated model accuracy and processing speed to maximize the efficiency of Korean speech recognition. This is expected to contribute to the training of large-scale Korean speech recognition models and improve Conformer recognition errors. Future research should include additional experiments with diverse Korean speech datasets and enhance the recognition performance through structural improvements in the Conformer."
MEDU-Net+: a novel improved U-Net based on multi-scale encoder-decoder for medical image segmentation,2024,"['Medical image segmentation', 'Deep learning', 'U-Net', 'Multi-scale feature fusion', 'Skip connection']",,"The unique U-shaped structure of U-Net network makes it achieve good performance in image segmentation. This network is a lightweight network with a small number of parameters for small image segmentation datasets. However, when the medical image to be segmented contains a lot of detailed information, the segmentation results cannot fully meet the actual requirements. In order to achieve higher accuracy of medical image segmentation, a novel improved U-Net network architecture called multi-scale encoder-decoder U-Net+ (MEDU-Net+) is proposed in this paper. We design the GoogLeNet for achieving more information at the encoder of the proposed MEDU-Net+, and present the multi-scale feature extraction for fusing semantic information of different scales in the encoder and decoder. Meanwhile, we also introduce the layer-by-layer skip connection to connect the information of each layer, so that there is no need to encode the last layer and return the information. The proposed MEDU-Net+ divides the unknown depth network into each part of deconvolution layer to replace the direct connection of the encoder and decoder in U-Net. In addition, a new combined loss function is proposed to extract more edge information by combining the advantages of the generalized dice and the focal loss functions. Finally, we validate our proposed MEDU-Net+ MEDU-Net+ and other classic medical image segmentation networks on three medical image datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed MEDU-Net+ has prominent superior performance compared with other medical image segmentation networks."

In this study, we obtained SR results for SAR target and background LR images, which were converted using Real-ESRGAN. We utilized Real-ESRGAN with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)-oriented model that considered the noise characteristics of scattering points when SAR images were generated, to improve the identification of the SAR target LR images. We also applied SR to MSTAR SAR target and real satellite SAR images using bicubic interpolation, Real-ESRGAN, Real-ESRNet, and Real-ESR models. Finally, we analyzed the PSNR and structural similarity (SSIM) for a similarity evaluation of the SAR SR images. The experimental results revealed an average PSNR of 25.22 dB and SSIM of 0.68 compared to the original SAR images. This indicated the effectiveness of Real-ESRGAN in removing subtle noise characteristics, owing to the more refined and high-resolution scattering points obtained with this method."

Recently, research has actively progressed beyond the conventional classification methods towards learnable Bins. The key of this approaches lies in the Bins Optimization Module for estimating the optimal Bins, with various modules being proposed and significant advancements achieved. However, existing modules have limitations in the optimal Bins estimation, such as using the output representations of a layer of the network in a limited way(e.g. Splitter) or estimating Bins indirectly using a tool(e.g. Attractor) rather than these output representations directly estimating Bins. Therefore, to overcome the limitations described above, we propose a Deformable Cardinality Module (DCM) in which 1:1 matching of output representations and Bins is performed. This 1:1 matching method allowed the layer output representations to be independently matched and transformed within each bin, and the representations matched to each bin were estimated in the optimal direction, resulting in improved performance in MDE tasks. In addition, it is possible to estimate more precise Bins by using the Split-Transform-Conversion-Merge (STCM) strategy, which was recently proposed to improve MDE performance, and finally, through comparative experiments, it was confirmed that quantitative performance improvement and visual aspect of normal depth estimation are possible in various evaluation indicators."

The recommender system is proposed to identify user preferences based on past behavior and recommend suitable items. However, the effectiveness of the recommendation tends to be limited due to the data sparsity problem. To mitigate this issue, reviews have started to be widely used as a solution. Although research on review-based recommender systems is actively conducted, they ignore whether the content of reviews reflects the actual characteristics of items. In the real world, many reviews left by users may not relate to the item or fail to reflect the characteristics accurately. Therefore, this study proposes the CRARS (Content Relevance-based Adaptive Recommender System), which incorporates the relevance between review content and item features into recommendations. Specifically, we benefit from the superior ability to model interactions between features of the Co-Attention mechanism to capture this relevance. To evaluate the recommendation performance of the proposed CRARS model, we conducted extensive experiments by using data collected from Amazon.com. The experimental results indicated that the proposed CRARS model outperforms various baseline models, demonstrating the necessity of integrating the relevance between review and item into recommender systems."

It begins her personal background as a 1.5-generation Vietnamese American and her academic engagement in immigrant faith and the challenges of teaching faith in violent contexts. The work underscores the public dimension and impact of religious education, highlighting its potential for fostering critical capacities for public engagement. However, that study observes a prevalent disconnection between congregational culture and the aim of public engagement, leading to a form of learned helplessness among students and communities. The researcher draws on Paulo Freire’s concepts of “critical hope” and the need for a curriculum that transcends mere content delivery to foster transformative engagement with societal issues. The document critiques the disimigination machine that undermines critical thinking and collective resistance, as articulated by Henry Giroux, and explores the concepts of “learned helplessness” as a barrier to environmental and social activism. The researcher advocates for a theopoetic and theopolitical approach to education that nurtures hope and practical engagement with the world’s injustice.

The purpose of this study is to use time-series data of average prices of ‘Setoka’ citrus traded in 9 wholesale markets and train an artificial neural network with an LSTM network structure to determine a suitable structure for predicting average prices for a given time period. The analysis focused on the average price of 3 kg of ‘Setoka's’ agricultural products from 2007 to January 2021, using 1,836 data points. 80% of the data was used for training the neural network, and 20% was used for testing. To determine the optimal LSTM network structure, the training iteration and batch size were varied to evaluate the accuracy of the training results. The optimal LSTM network structure was determined to be 500 training iterations and a batch size of 128. When predicting the price of ‘Setoka’ for the next month after the training data period, the predicted values were lower than the actual prices until 15 days prior, and the highest prediction accuracy was achieved on the 24th day. Moreover, the prediction accuracy was high from 15 days prior. Using an artificial neural network for ‘Setoka’ price prediction based on historical data can provide useful information for monitoring agricultural price trends, informing government policy decisions, and meeting consumer demands."

However, the real fault signals differ from simulation data due to the presence of noise and uncertainty of fault parameters. As a result, the performance of previous fault classification studies based on the simulation data may not work accurately when they are used in real fault data. In this research, we compared the classification performance of some previous fault classification works based on simulation data with real fault data. The result showed that the classification performance was severely reduced with real fault data. To overcome this mismatch between simulation and real fault data, we propose a fault classification model for real fault data. The proposed classification model combined the long short-term memory (LSTM) layer and fully connected (FC) layer with different input features to train time series and non-time series features from the data. The result shows that the proposed model classifies fault type with high accuracy for both simulation data and real fault data."

The performance of the Clipseg multimodal model was compared with two unimodal models including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Unet and Transformer-based Segformer for land cover classification. Using orthophotos of two areas (Area1 and Area2) in Wonju City, Gangwon Province, classification was performed for seven land cover categories (Forest, Cropland, Grassland, Wetland, Settlement, Bare Land, and Forestry-managed Land). The results showed that the Clipseg model demonstrated the highest generalization performance in new environments, achieving the highest accuracy among the three models with an Overall Accuracy of 83.9% and Kappa of 0.72 in the test area (Area2). It performed particularly well in classifying Forest (F1-Score 94.7%), Cropland (78.0%), and Settlement (78.4%). While Unet and Segformer models showed high accuracy in the training area (Area1), they exhibited limitations in generalization ability with accuracy decreases of 29% and 20% respectively in the test area. The Clipseg model required the most parameters (approximately 150 million) and the longest training time (10 hours 48 minutes) but showed stable performance in new environments. In contrast, Segformer achieved considerable accuracy with the least parameters (about 16 million) and the shortest training time (3 hours 21 minutes), demonstrating its potential for use in resource-limited environments. This study shows that image-text-based multimodal models have a high potential for land cover classification. Their superior generalization ability in new environments suggests they can be effectively applied to land cover classification in various regions. Future research could further improve classification accuracy through model structure improvements, addressing data imbalances, and additional validation in diverse environments."

Three types of defects in the h-BN monolayer (boron vacancy, nitrogen vacancy, and boron-nitrogen vacancy) were considered. The pristine h-BN monolayer had an electrical band gap of 4.6 eV, indicating its insulating properties. A monovacancy with boron or nitrogen defects introduced a new energy level within the band gap. In the case of divacancy by boron and nitrogen defects, two energy levels emerged (i.e., 1.3 eV and 1.8 eV from the conduction band, respectively) between the band gap, producing an environment conducive to electron excitation from the valence to the conduction band. As defects in the h-BN monolayer increased, the band gap filled gradually with new energy states. Consequently, the electrical properties shifted from insulator to conductor. This research contributes a methodology for predicting the material properties through computational calculations, providing insights into the evolving electrical behavior of h-BN with varying defect densities."

The research findings were obtained through both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analysis of the students’ responses showed no significant differences between reading the text and watching the video. However, the qualitative analysis revealed distinct patterns of literary understanding and responses between the two media. Reading the text encouraged deep internal interpretation and personal reflection, whereas watching the video enhanced visual comprehension and emotional engagement with the narrative. These findings suggest that integrating text reading and visual media in literature education can enrich students’ understanding and responses to literary works.

The complete solution to the problem has not been found yet, therefore only partial information about the structure can be obtained from mass spectra, often in the form of various molecular fingerprints. One of the latest approaches for prediction of molecular fingerprints from electron ionization mass spectra is DeepEI, which suggested a suboptimal procedure based on using a separate neural network for each molecular fingerprint (more than 100 models in our work and 636 using the DeepEI method). More than that, after repeating the procedure described in the original article, we assumed that at least some of their models were most likely overfitted. We streamlined the original approach by predicting multiple types of molecular finger- prints with a single multi-output neural network. We developed a lightweight and performant architecture (called Lite model for brevity) with improved accuracy (0.91 vs 0.89), precision (0.86 vs 0.77), and recall (0.71 vs 0.70) compared to the DeepEI approach. Additionally, the Lite version of the model was more than 100 times faster than the DeepEI approach in training and inference."

The metrics comparison results showed YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 out performed YOLOv7 and YOLOR regarding model precision, recall, F 1 score, and mAP50 values. YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 could successfully discriminate the three different bee species with an accuracy of almost 100% (99.9%, 99.8%, and 100% accuracy for honeybee, bumblebee, and leafcutting bee for the two models, respectively).Comparatively, YOLOv7 could discriminate honeybee with an accuracy of 95% but was more likely to mistakenly discriminate bumblebee and leafcutting bee due to the relatively lower discriminating accuracy (87.3% and 66.2%, respectively). While the values of determined parameters for YOLOR were lower than YOLOv3 and YOLOv5, the higher precision (0.99680) along with recall (0.98721), F 1 (0.99198), mAP50 (0.99323), and mAP50-100 (0.89076) values indicate that this model could be able to obtain a favorable performance in discriminating the three bee species. In summary, the proposed method in this study has the potential for identifying the alfalfa pollinating bee species, studying the bees’ flower-visiting behaviors, evaluating the risks of insect-mediated pollen flow, and thus contributing to the management of genetically engineered (GE) alfalfa transgene flow."

To demonstrate the performance of our approach, we conducted several experiments that have shown the effectiveness of the deepfake detection task."

However, object recognition through camera (RGB, Thermal) sensorsmay not always be accurate during nighttime, in adverse weather conditions, or when the intruder iscamouflaged. In such situations, it is possible to detect intruders by utilizing the trajectories of objectsextracted from camera or radar sensors. This paper proposes a method to detect intruders using onlytrajectory information in environments where object recognition is challenging. The proposed methodinvolves training an LSTM-Attention based trajectory classification model using normal and abnormal(intrusion, loitering) trajectory data of animals and humans. This model is then used to identifyabnormal human trajectories and perform intrusion detection. Finally, the validity of the proposedmethod is demonstrated through experiments using real data."
Recent Advances in Passive Radiative Cooling: Material Design Approaches,2024,"['passive radiative cooling', 'polymer composite', 'thermal emitter', 'deep learning', 'energy harvesting']",,"Passive radiative cooling is a promising technology for cooling objects without energy input. Passive radiative cooling works by radiating heat from the surface, which then passes through the atmosphere and into space. Achieving efficient passive radiative cooling is mainly accomplished by using materials with high emissivity in the atmospheric window (8–13 μm). Research has shown that polymers tend to exhibit high emissivity in this spectral range. In addition to elastomers, other materials with potential for passive radiative cooling include metal oxides, carbon-based materials, and polymers. The structure of a passive radiative cooling device can affect its cooling performance. For example, a device with a large surface area will have a greater amount of surface area exposed to the sky, which increases the amount of thermal radiation emitted. Passive radiative cooling has a wide range of potential applications, including building cooling, electronics cooling, healthcare, and transportation. Current research has focused on improving the efficiency of passive radiative cooling materials and devices. With further development, passive radiative cooling can significantly affect a wide range of sectors."

However, currently, there is a lack of established guidelines for assessing and addressing eating behaviors in individuals with ASD. This gap in research exists due to the challenges associated with using traditional assessment methods, which may lead to discrepancies in responses and unintentional potential biases from caregivers. In this review, we provided a comprehensive overview of various eating behaviors commonly observed in individuals with ASD. These behaviors include 1) food neophobia, 2) selective eating, 3) binge eating, 4) food avoidance, 5) chewing and swallowing problems, 6) pica, 7) rumination, 8) rituals, and 9) problematic behaviors. Furthermore, we provide a perspective of utilizing digital tools: 1) augmentative and alternative communication; 2) ecological momentary assessment; and 3) video analysis, behavioral analysis, and facial expression analysis.

Enhancing Image Compression with Foveal Vision: A Multi-Focus FPSNR Assessment and Attention-Based Neural Network,2024,"['Foveation', 'Quality Assessment', 'Image Compression', 'Deep Learning']",,"In the field of image and video compression, the objective is to achieve a balance between compression efficiency and thequality of reconstructed images. The commonly used quality assessment method in this field is the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio(PSNR), which, however, has a limitation in that it only considers the differences in pixel values. To address this, our researchintroduces the Foveal Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (F_PSNR), a visual perception-based approach that reflects human foveal vision.Specifically, we propose a multi-focus F_PSNR assessment method that incorporates the visual characteristics of humans for imagescontaining multiple objects of interest. Additionally, we suggest a model that integrates an attention mechanism focusing on thequality of objects of interest into the existing neural network-based compression method to enhance perception-based quality.Experimental results using the KODAK dataset demonstrate that applying the attention mechanism to existing methods can enhancethe human-perceptual compression efficiency of neural networks."

The key to solve the problem is to establish the relationship between the tunnelling attitude and the controlling parameters and to predict the tunnelling attitude accordingly. For this, this paper introduced a TBM tunnelling attitude predicting method. In detail, using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), the initial tunnelling attitude and the controlling parameters of each later ring are taken as input, while the tunnelling attitude of each later rings are regarded as the output, and the relationship between the input and output is established. Meanwhile, for avoid the over-fitting and error accumulation risk of LSTM, the theoretical relationship between the input and output is also built based on the TBM mechanical movement principle, and it is also involved into the LSTM-based relationship as constraints. The proposed method is verified by the field data collected from the 6th Section of the Qingdao Metro Project, and the results reveal that the proposed LSTM-based method is accurate and acceptable."

Super-Resolution Reconstruction of Humidity Fields based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty,2024,"['super-resolution', 'generative adversarial network', 'relative humidity', 'deep learning', 'gradient penalty.']",,"Humidity is an important parameter in meteorology and is closely related to weather, human health, and the environment. Due to the limitations of the number of observation stations and other factors, humidity data are often not as good as expected, so high-resolution humidity fields are of great interest and have been the object of desire in the research field and industry. This study presents a novel super-resolution algorithm for humidity fields based on the Wasserstein generative adversarial network(WGAN) framework, with the objective of enhancing the resolution of low-resolution humidity field information. WGAN is a more stable generative adversarial networks(GANs) with Wasserstein metric, and to make the training more stable and simple, the gradient cropping is replaced with gradient penalty, and the network feature representation is improved by sub-pixel convolution, residual block combined with convolutional block attention module(CBAM) and other techniques. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using ERA5 relative humidity data with an hourly resolution of 0.25°×0.25°. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms not only conventional interpolation techniques, but also the super-resolution generative adversarial network(SRGAN) algorithm."

This analysis included 1,150 videos from KBS’s “The World Now”(November 2019 to October 2023), with 236 videos about disasters. We identified countries from the collected videos and measured the development levels of 103 countries based on the Human Development Index (HDI). Furthermore, we extracted 25,317 key-frames from disaster videos and classified them into eight types by employing an image classifier we developed based on Vision Transformer. Results of the video-level analysis revealed that countries with higher development levels in North America and Europe, as well as conflict-ridden countries, tended to have more videos. In contrast, disaster video ratios were higher in coverage related to the third-world, such as Africa. This implies that quantitative inequality and qualitative bias persist in international news, depending on the country’s development level. In a frame-level analysis, disaster videos about the third-world featured more images of human damage. Sensational reporting, focusing on evoking emotions rather than fostering a nuanced understanding of disasters, was evident through the vivid portrayal of victims. This indicates a deviation from the norms of disaster reporting, taking advantage of the lack of protection for victims in the third-world. As Susan Sontag pointed out, it can be argued that such reporting, through the everyday consumption of ‘pains of others’, reinforces the spread of apathy and indifference towards the sufferings without practical engagement."

The goal of this study is to explore methods for vocabulary and tokenization, specifically concerning gloss used in sign language translation, aiming to appropriately harness the potential of gloss. Existing sign language translation studies inadequately consider the unique aspects of sign languages and rely on conventional spoken language machine translation methodologies. Particularly, there is a lack of investigation into gloss vocabulary and tokenization methods within the sign language domain, disregarding the diverse characteristics of sign languages across different countries and employing uniform methods for dictionary building and tokenization. Consequently, our focus lies on exploring language-specific vocabulary and tokenization methods within the sign language domain.

A partial decoder was added at the end of the backbone network to facilitate thefusion of multilevel features for a comprehensive feature map. A reverse attention mechanism guides the modelto refine details layer-by-layer while introducing contextual information and extracting richer expressionfeatures. To enhance feature distinguishability, we employed islanding loss in combination with softmax loss,creating a joint loss function. Using two open datasets, our experimental results demonstrated the effectivenessof our framework. Our framework achieved an average accuracy rate of 74.08% on the FER2013 dataset and98.66% on the CK+ dataset, outperforming advanced methods in both recognition accuracy and stability."

Currently, research on developing and advancing models for diagnosing plant diseases and pests using artificial intelligence is being actively conducted. However, even if the model showed good performance during verification, the performance deteriorates when the resolution of the input image is low during operation. If disease control is delayed because of delayed diseases diagnosis due to low resolution, the entire crop is affected by the diseases resulting in a decrease in yield. The purpose of this study was to improve the reproducibility of the model by utilizing super-resolution that increases the resolution of the image. BICUBIC, SRCNN, and SRGAN were used as super-resolution algorithms. After x4 scale super-resolution of test images with 64×64, 128×128, and 192×192 resolutions, they were directly input into the trained YOLOv5 model. As a result, the recall improved by 34% in SRGAN, 30% in SRCNN, and 19% in BICUBIC."

Based on the YOLOv5 algorithm, we improve the loss function, propose a new feature extraction module to obtain the receptive field at different scales, and do adaptive fusion with the SGE attention mechanism, so that it can effectively suppress the noise information during feature extraction. The trained model improves the mAP value by 5.7% on the public dataset UA-DETRAC without increasing the amount of calculations. Meanwhile, for vehicle feature recognition, we adaptively adjust the network structure of the DeepSort tracking algorithm. Finally, we tested the tracking algorithm on the public dataset and in a realistic scenario.

Cyber threats such as forgery, duplication, and hacking of biometric characteristics are increasing in the field of biometrics. In response, the security system is strengthened and complex, and it is becoming difficult for individuals to use. To this end, multiple biometric models are being studied.

To address these challenges, we developed a novel approach that integrates a sequence-to-sequence Transformer architecture with the Vision Transformer (ViT) model to achieve enhanced authentication speed and efficiency. The Sequence-to-Sequence structure allows input ECG signals to be processed in short patches by the transformer model, enabling real-time analysis of electrocardiogram signals. In addition, we employed masking techniques to tokenized input patches, enabling the model to authenticate early even when only partial ECG signals are available.

Concurrently, numerous vulnerabilities related to adversarial attacks, which are techniques designed to force models into misclassification, have been discovered. In particular, adversarial attacks such as physical adversarial attacks in the real world, pose a serious threat to autonomous vehicle systems. These attacks include artificially created attacks such as adversarial patches and attacks that exploit natural elements to cause misclassification. A common scenario in autonomous driving environments involves obstruction of traffic signs by natural elements such as fallen leaves or snow. These elements do not remain stationary. They can cause misclassification even in fleeting moments, highlighting a critical vulnerability. Therefore, this study investigated adversarial patch attacks based on natural elements, proposing fallen leaves as a natural adversarial element. Specifically, it reviewed current trends in adversarial attack research, presented an experimental environment based on natural elements, and analyzed experimental results to assess vulnerabilities posed by fallen leaves in physical environments to autonomous vehicles."

Specifically, animal sound classification, which identifies species based on their sounds, is gaining great attention where video-based discrimination is impractical. Traditional studies have relied on a single deep learning model to classify animal sounds. However, sounds collected in outdoor settings often include substantial background noise, complicating the task for a single model. In addition, data imbalance among species may lead to biased model training.

However, available imaging modalities (computed tomography [CT], conventional magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], and 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography [PET]/CT) have limitations. The advent of new imaging techniques and novel molecular imaging agents have revealed molecular processes in the tumor microenvironment as an application for the early diagnosis and assessment of PM as well as real-time guided surgical resection, which has changed clinical management. In contrast to clinical imaging, which is purely qualitative and subjective for interpreting macroscopic structures, radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) capitalize on high-dimensional numerical data from images that may reflect tumor pathophysiology. A predictive model can be used to predict the occurrence, recurrence, and prognosis of PM, thereby avoiding unnecessary exploratory surgeries. This review summarizes the role and status of different imaging techniques, especially new imaging strategies such as spectral photon-counting CT, fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) PET/CT, near-infrared fluorescence imaging, and PET/MRI, for early diagnosis, assessment of surgical indications, and recurrence monitoring in patients with PM. The clinical applications, limitations, and solutions for fluorescence imaging, radiomics, and AI are also discussed."

Poor wire harness quality is directly linked to product failure, fire, and personal injury, so quality control is key to preventing this. In the wire harness manufacturing process, quality inspection is especially important for crimp harnesses, which are the product of the crimping process that crimp terminals onto stripped wire cables. In this paper, we propose a U-net encoder-based ensemble method for crimping process quality inspection. The ensemble method combines several different U-net structures to produce a more accurate final prediction. The ensemble weight calculation algorithm determines the ensemble weights, firstly, through the average values of IoU, F1 score, recall, and precision of the U-Net models, and secondly, by penalizing the models with lower average values of IoU. The analysis of the ensemble method using crimped harness images obtained from a wire harness manufacturing plant showed that the discrimination accuracy reached 95.41%.

Performance Comparison of Water Body Detection from Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 Optical Imagery Using Attention U-Net Model,2024,"['Sentinel-1', 'Sentinel-2', 'Attention U-Net', 'Water body detection', 'Deep learning']",,"As global warming accelerates greenhouse gas emissions, the frequency and severity of abnormal weather events such as floods and droughts are increasing, complicating disaster management and amplifying socio-economic damage. In response, effective strategies for mitigating water-related disasters and proactively addressing climate change are essential, which can be achieved through the use of satellite imagery. This study aims to compare the water body detection performance of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery using the Attention U-Net model. Through this comparison, the study seeks to identify the strengths and limitations of each satellite imagery type for water body detection. A 256 × 256-pixel patch dataset was developed using multi-temporal imagery from the Han River and Nakdong River basins to reflect seasonal variations in water bodies, including conditions during wet, dry, and flood seasons. Additionally, the study evaluates the impact of data augmentation techniques on model performance, emphasizing the need to select augmentation methods that align with the specific characteristics of SAR and optical data. The results demonstrate that Sentinel-1 SAR imagery exhibited stable performance in detecting large water bodies, achieving high precision in defining water boundaries (Intersection over Union [IoU]: 0.964, F1-score: 0.982). In contrast, Sentinel-2 optical imagery achieved slightly lower accuracy (IoU: 0.880, F1-score: 0.936) but performed well in detecting complex water boundaries, such as those found in wetlands and riverbanks. While data augmentation techniques improved the performance of the Sentinel-1 SAR dataset, they had only a marginal effect on Sentinel-2 optical imagery, aside from slight improvements in boundary detection under new environmental conditions. Overall, this study underscores the importance of threshold and satellite imagery integration for water body monitoring. It further emphasizes the value of selecting appropriate data augmentation techniques tailored to the characteristics of each dataset.

We apply the class logits knowledge distillation used in the image classification task, by allowing student model mimic the classification logits of the teacher model, to guide the student model to improve the detection accuracy.

Novel Category Discovery in Plant Species and Disease Identification through Knowledge Distillation,2024,"['novel class discovery', 'knowledge distillation', 'plant disease classification', 'deep-learning']",,"Identifying plant species and diseases is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and achieving optimal crop yields, making it a topic of significant practical importance. Recent studies have extended plant disease recognition from traditional closed-set scenarios to open-set environments, where the goal is to reject samples that do not belong to known categories. However, in open-world tasks, it is essential not only to define unknown samples as ""unknown"" but also to classify them further. This task assumes that images and labels of known categories are available and that samples of unknown categories can be accessed. The model classifies unknown samples by learning the prior knowledge of known categories. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing research on this topic in plant-related recognition tasks.To address this gap, this paper utilizes knowledge distillation to model the category space relationships between known and unknown categories. Specifically, we identify similarities between different species or diseases. By leveraging a fine-tuned model on known categories, we generate pseudo-labels for unknown categories. Additionally, we enhance the baseline method's performance by using a larger pre-trained model, dino-v2. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the large plant specimen dataset Herbarium19 and the disease dataset Plant Village. Notably, our method outperforms the baseline by 1% to 20% in terms of accuracy for novel category classification. We believe this study will contribute to the community."

Previously, a single channel was often replicated into three channels; however, this approach may limit detection performance due to information redundancy. To overcome this limitation, we propose a method that replicates the single-channel IR image into three channels, with each channel processed using different preprocessing techniques, such as CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), Laplacian Filter, and Top-hat transform, to improve detection performance. In this study, we utilized the RT-DETRv2 detection model and the Anti-UAV300 dataset, using IR images sampled at 10-frame intervals for our experiments.By evaluating the effects of each preprocessing technique and deriving the optimal configuration, our method achieved a 2.2% improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) over conventional methods. This confirms that our method enhances performance over simple replication, presenting a novel approach to improving object detection performance in IR imaging, with promising applications across various fields, particularly in disaster situations where infrared cameras are utilized, as well as in nighttime surveillance and reconnaissance."

Real-time rendering and high performance are essential for NVS technology to be effectively utilized in various applications. Recently, 3D-GS (3D Gaussian Splatting) has gained popularity due to its faster training and inference times compared to those of NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)-based methodologies. However, since 3D-GS reconstructs a 3D (Three-Dimensional) scene by splitting and cloning (Density Control) Gaussian points, the number of Gaussian points continuously increases, causing the model to become heavier as training progresses. To address this issue, we propose two methodologies: 1) Gaussian blending, an improved density control methodology that removes unnecessary Gaussian points, and 2) a performance enhancement methodology using a depth estimation model to minimize the loss in representation caused by the blending of Gaussian points. Experiments on the Tanks and Temples Dataset show that the proposed methodologies reduce the number of Gaussian points by up to 4% while maintaining performance."

DNN-Based Force Estimation in Hyper-Redundant Manipulators,2024,"['Hyper-redundant manipulator', 'Minimally invasive surgery', 'Surgical robot', 'Force estimation', 'Machine learning']",,"Hyper-redundant manipulators (HRMs) have been applied to many robotic surgery platforms because they can be bent in various directions as they consist of many rigid segments and are operated in a cable-driven manner, allowing remote placement of actuators. However, due to the long kinematic chain and wire stretching when subjected to force, HRMs have disadvantages, including inaccurate positioning and difficulty in building physics-based models. These constraints pose challenges in realizing force feedback using HRMs. In this paper, we present a deep neural network (DNN) based estimation system for the external force exerted on the distal end of the HRMs using tensions and fixed positions of the cables as input data, which can be measured outside the human body. To generate a training dataset for DNN, a physics-based HRM model considering external forces, cable tensions, cable friction, and cable extension was developed. We also proposed the iterative optimization algorithm for the optimal configuration of the HRM. The training dataset was produced through simulation using the physics-based HRM model, and then the DNN-based force estimation model was trained. The HRM prototype was fabricated to verify the reliability of the training dataset and evaluate the performance of the DNN-based force estimation model. The estimated magnitude and angle errors of the external force were 4.8% and 10.4% on average, respectively. This demonstrates the feasibility of measuring the external force without force/torque sensors, which can help realize force feedback in HRMs."

Therefore, various studies in the review helpfulness prediction have been proposed, demonstrating the importance of identifying and providing meaningful reviews to consumers. However, most studies focused on extracting the semantic features from review texts, the accompanying star ratings are not introduced in the prediction task. Therefore, this study aims to introduce such star rating information and predict review helpfulness from the perspective of review consistency between review texts and star ratings. The BERTexCon (BERT-CNN Text and Rating Consistency Model for Review Helpfulness Prediction) proposed in this study consists of feature encoder and consistency extraction. The feature encoder module is used to extract features from review text and star rating information, and the consistency extraction module is used to extract consistency between the information. Specifically, this study applies the BERT-CNN model to conduct predictions based on main features that can significantly affect helpfulness. To evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed BERTexCon model, this study used real-world online reviews collected from Amazon.com. The experimental results showed that the BERTexCon model performs best compared to the various models applied in previous studies. Therefore, the proposed methodology of this study can be applied to various e-commerce platforms and provide an accurate review helpfulness prediction service."

Training-free neural architecture search: A review,2024,['Neural architecture searchDeep neural networkTraining-freeZero-shotInternet of things'],,"The goal of neural architecture search (NAS) is to either downsize the neural architecture and model of a deep neural network (DNN), adjust a neural architecture to improve its end result, or even speed up the whole training process. Such improvements make it possible to generate or install the model of a DNN on a small device, such as a device of internet of things or wireless sensor network. Because most NAS algorithms are time-consuming, finding out a way to reduce their computation costs has now become a critical research issue. The training-free method (also called the zero-shot learning) provides an alternative way to estimate how good a neural architecture is more efficiently during the process of NAS by using a lightweight score function instead of a general training process to avoid incurring heavy costs. This paper starts with a brief discussion of DNN and NAS, followed by a brief review of both model-dependent and model-independent training-free score functions. A brief introduction to the search algorithms and benchmarks that were widely used in a training-free NAS will also be given in this paper. The changes, potential, open issues, and future trends of this research topic are then addressed in the end of this paper."

However, the comprehensive annotation of sentiment values for all content often necessitates manual intervention, which is not cost-effective. As a result, the frequent absence of sentiment annotations in multimodal datasets poses a significant challenge to the performance of sentiment-based search and prediction models. To address this issue, it becomes essential to impute missing sentiment values to enhance the efficacy of sentiment-based analyses. The primary objective of this study is to propose a novel sentiment imputation method tailored for multimodal sentiment analysis. Specifically, we introduce an imputation approach based on the VisualBERT framework. To further augment the semantic richness of 3D asset information, we leverage the Large Language-and-Vision Assistant (LLaVA), a Large Multimodal Model (LMM), to extract sentiment-related textual information from 3D asset images.

While technological research is underway, employing AI-based object detection models for weapon detection and perpetrator facial recognition, there remains a challenge in swiftly responding to spontaneously occurring situations like non-synchronous crimes, particularly in detecting perpetrators without criminal records. This study proposes an intelligent CCTV video detection framework based on the YOLOv8 model, integrating weapon detection and emotion analysis during video processing. The framework combines weapon detection and emotion analysis to assess crises in real-time and establish appropriate response levels accurately. Emotion analysis scrutinizes individuals facial expressions in the footage, discerning emotions to gauge the situations urgency. Emotion analysis results are crucial in assessing danger levels and integrating human emotional elements into precise crisis judgment. Implementing this framework enables real-time risk level assignment and appropriate responses, facilitating swift reactions to dangerous situations."

However, the investigation process is time-consuming and inefficient due to the need for manual review of long-duration CCTV footage to identify suspects. Therefore, it is essential to establish an automated system for identifying hit-and-run suspects to reduce unnecessary manpower consumption. This paper proposes a system that utilizes artificial intelligence technology on CCTV footage to automatically detect the moment of a 'hit-and-run' incident and track the offending vehicle. Upon receiving CCTV footage, the system undergoes processes of selecting the victim vehicle, estimating the time of the accident, and estimating the offending vehicle, thereby detecting the most probable hit-and-run offending vehicle. To address the vulnerabilities of existing vehicle accident detection methods and to reduce errors caused by irrelevant surrounding objects, the process of object segmentation and detection models, as well as object tracking and depth estimation models, were introduced to separately classify surrounding objects. Additionally, to enhance the detection performance of domestic vehicles captured in CCTV footage, a separate dataset was compiled to improve object detection performance. When this system was applied to actual hit-and-run cases recorded by CCTV, it accurately detected the time of the accident and demonstrated a processing speed of over 27fps in HD resolution video."

To identify relevant studies, we searched the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases without restrictions on publication date. Ultimately, we analyzed 16 randomized controlled trials involving 13,685 participants. The primary outcome assessed was the effect of AI-assisted colonoscopy (AIAC) on the adenoma detection rate (ADR). Secondary outcomes included the polyp detection rate (PDR) and adenomas per colonoscopy (APC). A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled effect sizes, and statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the Higgins I2 statistic, with I2 cutoff points of 25%, 50%, and 75% indicating low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively. Publication bias was investigated using a funnel plot, and the quality of evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. The findings indicated a 26% greater ADR with AIAC than with standard colonoscopy (40.4% vs. 31.9%). Additionally, AIAC was associated with a 30% greater PDR (52.9% vs. 40.1%) and a 44% higher APC.

Confucius’ idea of “Revere One’s Virtuous Nature” in his later years inherited the idea of hexagram Meng “Enlightening the Ignorant and Make Them Follow the Right Path—cultivating morality—Obtaining the achievement of sages”. It is very likely that Confucius’ idea of “Follow the Golden Mean” originated from hexagram Meng. The following educational ideas of Confucius are in line with the hexagram texts of hexagram Meng: learning actively, sincerely seeking education, setting a good example, education for all without discrimination, perseverance is the key to learning, choosing the right course and follow it, feeling not ashamed to learn from one’s subordinates, educational punishment. With the date of Commentary on The Book of Changes confirmed, the study of material written before Confucius as an independent text helps us to explore the commonalities between educational philosophy in hexagram Meng and Confucius’ educational thought."

Various deep learning models for text sequences have demonstrated notable success in text classification tasks. However, as the trend of writing personalized reviews and social network posts grows, shifts in language usage have emerged. Hate speech in online reviews has become a significant social issue, leading individuals to experience anxiety, loneliness, depression, or even suicidal thoughts. In this study, we aim to integrate sentiment analysis into hate speech classification to examine its effects on detecting toxic language in text reviews. To achieve this, we utilized a dataset that includes multi-class emotion classification. In addition, we incorporated similarity analysis for individual sentences, applying it through our proposed weighted method. For hate speech recognition, we conducted experiments using an open Korean dataset. Our results indicate that incorporating our proposed method into hate speech recognition slightly improved the F1-score. Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between hate speech and emotions through topic modeling."
A study on the quantificational interpretation of donkey phrase in English: utilizing Next Sentence Prediction with BERT,2024,"['donkey sentence', 'quantificational interpretation', 'ChatGPT', 'BERT', 'Next Sentence Prediction']",,"The goal of the current paper is to explore the interpretation pattern of four different types of quantificational meaning (universal/existential/deictic/generic) of the donkey phrase in English. Specifically, we utilize two deep learning language models: ChatGPT and BERT. A dataset comprising a total of 240 sentences, with 60 sentences generated by ChatGPT, underwent Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) analysis with BERT. The statistical examination, based on surprisal values, revealed a hierarchy of low surprisal values signifying high acceptability in quantificational interpretations: existential > universal > deictic > generic. Regarding the configurations of definite NP and pronouns in the donkey phrase, stand-alone sentences favored pronoun usage, while in NSP, definite NP demonstrated a more innate acceptability. This implies that, even in theoretical analysis, the E-type theory employing quantifier expressions may present a more fitting framework for donkey phrases compared to the discourse representation theory utilizing bound variable pronouns."

In den letzten Jahren hat sich jedoch die Rechenleistung von Computern dank der von Nvidia hergestellten Computerchips drastisch erhöht. In Verbindung mit algorithmischen Lernmethoden, dem so genannten Deep Learning, hat dies dazu geführt, dass die Rechenleistung der KI auf praktische Lebensbereiche angewendet werden kann. Der Kern der KI kann als Algorithmus bezeichnet werden, und es stellt sich die Frage, wie Algorithmen rechtlich zu betrachten sind, d. h. ob die Rechtsnatur von Algorithmen als Verwaltungsvorschrift, als Rechtsverordnung, die sich auf das Verwaltungshandeln einer Verwaltungsbehörde auswirkt, oder einfach als ein in einem Computer enthaltenes Element zu betrachten ist. In dieser Hinsicht ist es notwendig, ein praktisches Urteil zu fällen, das auf dem Grad der Beteiligung der künstlichen Intelligenz an den Verwaltungshandlungen beruht, um ihre Rechtsnatur zu bestimmen.Wenn Algorithmen auch in starke und schwache Algorithmen unterteilt werden, bewegen wir uns in Richtung starke Algorithmen. Starke Algorithmen haben das Problem der Undurchsichtigkeit des algorithmischen Prozesses, weshalb die Diskussion über erklärbare Algorithmen voranschreitet. Es stellt sich die Frage, wie diese erklärbaren Algorithmen mit den Grundrechten der einzelnen Unternehmen, wie der Berufsfreiheit und dem Schutz von Geschäftsgeheimnissen, in Einklang gebracht werden können.In Korea wird KI auch zunehmend bei Verwaltungsverfügungen und auch anderen Verwaltungsmaßnahmen eingesetzt. Derzeit wird sie eher zur Durchführung von Ermittlungen und zur Sammlung von Informationen zur Vorbereitung von Verwaltungsmaßnahmen als zur Verwaltungsverfügung eingesetzt. Der Einsatz von KI erfordert in erster Linie eine Rechtsgrundlage, und es ist ein Rechtssystem erforderlich, das mit dem Grundsatz der Gewährleistung der Grundrechte gemäß der Verfassung vereinbar ist. Es braucht Regelungen für den Umgang mit Schäden, die durch KI verursacht werden. Die Funktionsweise der künstlichen Intelligenz beruht auf einer großen Menge von Daten, was Fragen nach deren Wahrheitsgehalt, Angemessenheit und Fairness aufwirft. Es gibt auch Forderungen nach Transparenz darüber, wie Algorithmen ausgelöst werden.Als Rechtsgrundlage für die künstliche Intelligenz sind verschiedene Gesetzesentwürfe in Vorbereitung. Zu den wichtigsten Inhalten gehören die Definition des Begriffs der künstlichen Intelligenz und die Unterscheidung zwischen künstlicher Intelligenz, die besonders in die Grundrechte der Bürger eingreift. Derzeit ist der Einsatz von künstlicher Intelligenz im Zusammenhang mit Verwaltungsakten im Verwaltungsgrundgesetz unter dem Begriff der automatischen Verfügungen geregelt, und die Bestimmungen dieses Artikels sehen vor, dass vollautomatische Verfügungen unter Einsatz künstlicher Intelligenz nur bei gebundenen Verwaltungsakten, nicht aber bei Ermessenshandlungen erlassen werden können. Es ist notwendig, den Erlass von Verwaltungsakten unter Einsatz von KI bei Ermessensentscheidungen zu ermöglichen, und es ist auch notwendig, den Schutz der anderen Partei des Verwaltungsverfahrens nach dem koreanischen Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz bei Verwaltungsakten unter Einsatz von KI zu harmonisieren.In Anbetracht der Tatsache, dass das Zeitalter der künstlichen Intelligenz immer näher rückt, müssen systematischere Regeln für den Einsatz von künstlicher Intelligenz im Verwaltungshandeln entwickelt werden."

TDA is applied to the first 10 min of the LoL gameplay data, focusing on damage, experience, and resource metrics, thereby revealing the deep structural patterns that influence game outcomes. This approach enables a nuanced analysis beyond the capabilities of traditional methods, capturing non-linear interactions between players and teams. This study offers a new perspective on time-series data analysis and predictive modeling in digital games, highlighting the potential of TDA in understanding complex systems. Although the study focuses on LoL, the promising results suggest that TDA can be applied to the analysis  of different types of complex data, providing valuable insights into dynamic and strategic environments."

Bayesian Game Theoretic Model for Evasive AI Malware Detection in IoT,2024,"['Bayesian Game Theoretic Model', 'Evasive AI Malware']",,"In this paper, we deal with a game theoretic problem to explore interactions between evasive Artificial Intelligence (AI) malware and detectors in Internet of Things (IoT). Evasive AI malware is defined as malware having capability of eluding detection by exploiting artificial intelligence such as machine learning and deep leaning. Detectors are defined as IoT devices participating in detection of evasive AI malware in IoT. They can be separated into two groups such that one group of detectors can be armed with detection capability powered by AI, the other group cannot be armed with it. Evasive AI malware can take three strategies of Nonattack, Non-AI attack, AI attack. To cope with these strategies of evasive AI malware, detector can adopt three strategies of Non-defense, Non-AI defense, AI defense. We formulate a Bayesian game theoretic model with these strategies employed by evasive AI malware and detector. We derive pure strategy Bayesian Nash Equilibria in a single stage game from the formulated Bayesian game theoretic model. Our devised work is useful in the sense that it can be used as a basic game theoretic model for developing AI malware detection schemes."
F_MixBERT: Sentiment Analysis Model using Focal Loss for Imbalanced E-commerce Reviews,2024,"['E-commerce reviews', 'Sentiment analysis', 'BERT', 'MixMatch', 'Focal loss']",,"Users' comments after online shopping are critical to product reputation and business improvement. These comments, sometimes known as e-commerce reviews, influence other customers' purchasing decisions. To confront large amounts of e-commerce reviews, automatic analysis based on machine learning and deep learning draws more and more attention. A core task therein is sentiment analysis. However, the e-commerce reviews exhibit the following characteristics: (1) inconsistency between comment content and the star rating; (2) a large number of unlabeled data, i.e., comments without a star rating, and (3) the data imbalance caused by the sparse negative comments. This paper employs Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), one of the best natural language processing models, as the base model. According to the above data characteristics, we propose the F_MixBERT framework, to more effectively use inconsistently low-quality and unlabeled data and resolve the problem of data imbalance. In the framework, the proposed MixBERT incorporates the MixMatch approach into BERT’s high-dimensional vectors to train the unlabeled and low-quality data with generated pseudo labels. Meanwhile, data imbalance is resolved by Focal loss, which penalizes the contribution of large-scale data and easily-identifiable data to total loss. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms BERT and MixBERT for sentiment analysis of e-commerce comments."

A corpus of 145 creative writing samples from 6th-grade students was analysed to examine both linguistic features and creative thinking skills by employing the Coh-Metrix Text Profile (TERA) and Guilford’s Divergent Thinking Model. The results indicate a high level of narrativity and syntactic simplicity, as well as deep cohesion in the students' writing, reflecting their developmental stage and educational practices. However, the analysis also reveals limitations in flexibility and originality, which may be attributed to the cultural impact on creativity. These findings may support the integration of creative thinking skills into language learning in EFL education, emphasising the need for targeted pedagogical strategies to foster originality and diverse perspectives among young learners in the Korean EFL contexts."

To successfully apply digital twin into a system, a model of the system has to be accurately identified. Koopman Operator Theorey proved in 1931 sheds light on the system identification because it makes us interpret a nonlinear dynamical system as a linear system. Nowdays, deep learning technoloiges with the theory have been used for the system identification. We herein aim to review a model named as Koopman Autoencoder (KAE), which is considered to be baseline in the literature, and propose a new training/inference strategy to improve the performance of KAE for future estimation. To demonstrate advantages of our strategy, we develop two KAE models with/without our strategy, using synthetic datasets generated with the IEEE 3-Bus system. We show that KAE with the strategy can achieve a better performance with respect to mean squared error and relative root mean squared error, compared to KAE without it."

Air quality index prediction using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average transductive long short-term memory,2024,"['air pollutant', 'air quality index', 'seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average', 'time-series data', 'transductive long short-term memory']",,"We obtain the air quality index (AQI) for a descriptive system aimed to com-municate pollution risks to the population. The AQI is calculated based on major air pollutants including O3, CO, SO2, NO, NO2, benzene, and particulate matter PM2.5 that should be continuously balanced in clean air. Air pollution is a major limitation for urbanization and population growth in developing countries. Hence, automated AQI prediction by a deep learning method applied to time series may be advantageous. We use a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model for predicting values reflecting past trends considered as seasonal patterns. In addition, a transductive long short-term memory (TLSTM) model learns dependencies through recurring memory blocks, thus learning long-term dependencies for AQI prediction. Further, the TLSTM increases the accuracy close to test points, which consti-tute a validation group. AQI prediction results confirm that the proposed SARIMA–TLSTM model achieves a higher accuracy (93%) than an existing convolutional neural network (87.98%), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model (78%), and generative adversarial network (89.4%)."

Moreover, Western science technology and culture had been gradually introduced into China by this time. The Korean envoys of the Daoguang period had a broader international perspective than earlier envoys and were able to view the Qing Dynasty and themselves in a more diverse cultural context. In the twelfth year of Daoguang (1832), Jin Jingshan went to China as the Condescendence official and collected what he saw and heard in China as YanYuanZhiZhi, in which he describes the real style of Beijing in the Daoguang period with keen observations and deep insight, which gives this work high research value.the image of Beijing described by Jin Jingshan has the following aspects: First, Beijing was a magnificent city with a rich culture and a long history that had not lost the style of the imperial capital. Second, it was a society where east met west. In Beijing, where envoys from various countries lived, various cultures met and collided. However, due to the limitations of the time, Jin Jingshan’s acceptance of western scientific knowledge remained at the level of objects, and he thus failed to realize that great changes in the world were underway. Third, Beijing hosted a bustling and luxurious market. The shops presented a carnival scene: abundant material and people, a wide range of goods, well-developed and smooth trade, and people living and working in peace and contentment. However, hidden behind this grandiosity was the crisis of luxury and irreconcilable contradiction between Manchu and Han, which revealed the inevitability of the Qing Dynasty’s decline. Fourth was the magnificent landscape. On the one hand, Jin Jingshan admired the magnificent beauty of the landscape and the great national strength and superb skills behind it; on the other hand, the rulers who built these landscapes were evaluated as profligate. This contradictory attitude embodies Jin Jingshan’s wavering between two views of China, “the differentiation of Hua & Yi” and “the China of Northern Learning,” which were the common conceptions of Korean envoys during the Daoguang period who tried to separate the high skills of the Qing Dynasty from its barbarian culture."

Dual-stream Co-enhanced Network for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation,2024,"['Unsupervised video object segmentation', 'Dual-stream Co-enhanced', 'Motion refinement', 'Feature aggregation', 'Dual-stream neural network']",,"Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) is a highly challenging problem in computer vision as the annotation of the target object in the testing video is unknown at all. The main difficulty is to effectively handle the complicated and changeable motion state of the target object and the confusion of similar background objects in video sequence. In this paper, we propose a novel deep Dual-stream Co-enhanced Network (DC-Net) for UVOS via bidirectional motion cues refinement and multi-level feature aggregation, which can fully take advantage of motion cues and effectively integrate different level features to produce high-quality segmentation mask. DC-Net is a dual-stream architecture where the two streams are co-enhanced by each other. One is a motion stream with a Motion-cues Refine Module (MRM), which learns from bidirectional optical flow images and produces fine-grained and complete distinctive motion saliency map, and the other is an appearance stream with a Multi-level Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM) and a Context Attention Module (CAM) which are designed to integrate the different level features effectively. Specifically, the motion saliency map obtained by the motion stream is fused with each stage of the decoder in the appearance stream to improve the segmentation, and in turn the segmentation loss in the appearance stream feeds back into the motion stream to enhance the motion refinement. Experimental results on three datasets (Davis2016, VideoSD, SegTrack-v2) demonstrate that DC-Net has achieved comparable results with some state-of-the-art methods."

Students learned the rules and strategies of audiovisual translation in the theory class and then used them as the basis for practical translation assignments. The translation assignments were based on the Japanese animations ""Your Name"" and ""Spirited Away"" and presented their translation strategy and the translated sentences. After the presentation, the students presented the translated example sentences and exchanged various opinions through peer review by their fellow learners. Through this series of processes, the class was designed to produce audiovisual translation results of higher quality than existing translations.As a result of the class, it was confirmed that the learners' translation and analytical skills were remarkable, and that their speed of improvement was very fast.

Wildfires occur frequently in South Korea, especially during the spring season. This study assessed post-wildfires areas in Gangneung, South Korea, on April 11, 2023, which were generated by implementing remote sensing technology and statistical analysis. Remote sensing and classification techniques, including PlanetScope, have been developed for identifying wildfire-damaged areas. The method for classifying post-wildfire mapping estimation includes the utilization of deep learning approaches, especially using the U-Net architecture. Therefore, the assessment of wildfire severity can be conducted using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-5P imagery in addition to an analysis of the vegetation type and air pollutant within the affected region. In the present study, Sentinel-2 imagery was to generate spectral indices, including the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR), differenced normalized difference moisture index (dNDMI), differenced soil adjusted vegetation index (dSAVI), and differenced normalized vegetation index (dNDVI). Sentinel-5P imagery was utilized to produce carbon monoxide (CO) column number densities. The estimation of wildfire areas was conducted using a PlanetScope classified image with the U-Net classifier, which was evaluated based on the overall accuracy value of 95% and kappa accuracy of 0.901. The wildfire severity level was shown by dNBR, which was correlated with the parameters, including RBR, dNDMI, dSAVI, dNDVI, and CO. The statistical analysis demonstrated a significant and positive correlation between the wildfire severity and the parameters. Moreover, the average of vegetation indices (NDMI, SAVI, and NDVI) before and after a wildfire were found to decrease by vegetation type, including 17.55% in mixed barren land areas, 17.49% in other grasses, 24.71% in mixed forest land, 22.48% in coniferous land, 13.48% in fields, and 4.29% in paddy fields. On the  basis of the results, these estimates can be employed to identify the level of damage caused by wildfires to vegetation and air quality."

Additionally, the effect of generalist CEOs is strengthened when they have an output-oriented functional background, while production-oriented and peripheral backgrounds have a weaker or non-significant influence. By employing deep learning models to measure CEO functional experience diversity, this study provides new insights into how leadership diversity shapes market communication and information transparency, particularly in emerging markets like China.

A recent study proved a lower bound for the clustering error of BMDP and proposed a two-step algorithm with a performance guarantee that nearly matches the lower bound. In the current paper, we empirically validate their results of that recent study by implementing and simulating the algorithm in a synthetic, non-regular BMDP environment.

The successful deployment of Level(L) 5, fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) depends on both technical safety and social acceptance. To achieve this, it is crucial to discuss various aspects of safety regulation at the level of positive law. However, the inclusion of the unrealistic trolley dillemma and the dubious ethics of AI/Robot in discussion of the satety regulation of AVs causes confusion, leading to many pointless and unnecessary debates. The trolley dilemma, which is nothing more than a hypothetical accident experiment, only causes confusion without any benefit in the context of AVs. Deep learning AI technology for collision avoidance has nothing to do with discrimination and human rights. In South Korea, however, the two guidelines for AVs of 2020 co-published by the government and other research group mistakenly demand a resolution to the unrealistic trolley dilemma and address dubious concerns of AI/Robot. A misguided focus on the trolley problem and AI/Robot ethics could hinder the social acceptance of AVs even before AD technology is fully developed. While there are safety concerns related AI for collision avoidance, attaining ‘zero risk’ is an impractical goal. Demanding zero risk would prohibit the deployment of AVs. Therefore, achieving a consensus on ‘acceptable positive risk’, both technically and socially, is imperative for the successful deployment of AVs. To facilitate this, the government should play a role in fostering rational risk communication among various stakeholders."
EEG 기반 SPD-Net에서 리만 프로크루스테스 분석에 대한 연구,2024,"['Riemannian Procrustes Analysis', 'EEG Classification', 'Riemannian manifold', 'SPD-Net']",,"This paper investigates the impact of Riemannian Procrustes Analysis (RPA) on enhancing the classification performance of SPD-Net when applied to EEG signals across different sessions and subjects. EEG signals, known for their inherent individual variability, are initially transformed into Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, which are natu- rally represented on a Riemannian manifold. To mitigate the variability between sessions and subjects, we employ RPA, a method that geometrically aligns the statistical distributions of these matrices on the manifold. This alignment is designed to reduce individual differences and improve the accuracy of EEG signal classification. SPD-Net, a deep learning archi- tecture that maintains the Riemannian structure of the data, is then used for classification. We compare its performance with the Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM) classifier, a conventional method rooted in Riemannian geometry. The ex- perimental results demonstrate that incorporating RPA as a preprocessing step enhances the classification accuracy of SPD-Net, validating that the alignment of statistical distributions on the Riemannian manifold is an effective strategy for improving EEG-based BCI systems. These findings suggest that RPA can play a role in addressing individual variability, thereby increasing the robustness and generalization capability of EEG signal classification in practical BCI applications."

A high-density gamma white spots-Gaussian mixture noise removal method for neutron images denoising based on Swin Transformer UNet and Monte Carlo calculation,2024,"['Neutron images', 'Image denoising', 'SUNet', 'Monte Carlo calculation', 'Gamma white spots', 'Gaussian noise']",,"During fast neutron imaging, besides the dark current noise and readout noise of the CCD camera, the main noise in fast neutron imaging comes from high-energy gamma rays generated by neutron nuclear reactions in and around the experimental setup. These high-energy gamma rays result in the presence of high-density gamma white spots (GWS) in the fast neutron image. Due to the microscopic quantum characteristics of the neutron beam itself and environmental scattering effects, fast neutron images typically exhibit a mixture of Gaussian noise. Existing denoising methods in neutron images are difficult to handle when dealing with a mixture of GWS and Gaussian noise. Herein we put forward a deep learning approach based on the Swin Transformer UNet (SUNet) model to remove high-density GWS-Gaussian mixture noise from fast neutron images. The improved denoising model utilizes a customized loss function for training, which combines perceptual loss and mean squared error loss to avoid grid-like artifacts caused by using a single perceptual loss. To address the high cost of acquiring real fast neutron images, this study introduces Monte Carlo method to simulate noise data with GWS characteristics by computing the interaction between gamma rays and sensors based on the principle of GWS generation. Ultimately, the experimental scenarios involving simulated neutron noise images and real fast neutron images demonstrate that the proposed method not only improves the quality and signal-to-noise ratio of fast neutron images but also preserves the details of the original images during denoising."

However, PXsare limited by the lack of third dimensional spatial information whereas CBCTs inflict high radiation exposure to patient.

This model is a hybrid model that combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning models, which are widely used in the field of recommending information, and is intended to further utilize preferred/non-preferred pattern analysis techniques derived by analyzing the usage rate of recommended information for each user. Through this, users are expected to receive improved recommendation results."

In particular, the number of online phishing and scam crimes using Ethereum is increasing. Therefore, there is a need for an effective way to detect Ethereum-based phishing and scams. In this paper, we propose an attentions-based 1D CNN model that can detect phishing activities by utilizing Ethereum on-chain data collected in real-time. The key feature of our model is the structure of a 1D CNN combined with an attentional mechanism that recognizes temporal patterns in transaction data to predict phishing. To evaluate the model, we compare it with existing deep learning models, and the results show that the proposed model has improved accuracy and AUC."

Point Cloud 3D Weldment Reconstruction and Welding Feature Extraction for Robotic Multi-bead Arc Weld Cladding Path Plaanning,2024,"['Monocular structured light visio', 'Statistical filtering', 'Point cloud segmentation', 'Welding path planning']",,"Traditional manual teaching or offline programming welding modes may lead to long teaching time, low efficiency, and inability to adapt to changing welding environments when facing complex trajectory workpieces or Multi-welded workpieces. In this paper, a teaching-free welding method based on visual sensing system for robotic is proposed. Firstly, the three-dimensional information of the workpiece surface is captured by a monocular structured light camera and characterized by point cloud data. Point cloud stitching is performed on multiple local images of large-size workpieces to reconstruct the welding surface. Then, statistical filtering and deep learning methods are used to preprocess and segment the point cloud to obtain the reference points of the welding path. Finally, according to the shape characteristics of the workpiece, the auxiliary projection method is used to automatically generate the robot surfacing path. Experimental results show that under the condition of camera accuracy of ± 0.05 mm, the maximum planning path error is less than 1 mm, which meets the actual welding needs. This method is significant for achieving welding automation and improving production efficiency."
Adaptive Classification of VPN and Non-VPN IoT Traffic Data Using CNN with Spatio-temporal Features,2024,"['Internet of Things', 'Adaptive Classification', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Virtual Private Network', 'Spatial and Temporal Features']",,"Low network throughput and high round-trip latency are two common challenges in Internet of Things (IoT) communications. This study addresses these issues by proposing an adaptive classification method that maintains network throughput above 360 Mbps and round-trip latency below 1 ms, while achieving a classification accuracy of 90% and a recall rate above 93.33%. This demonstrates the method’s ability to provide high throughput, low latency, and efficient traffic classification, addressing critical performance challenges in IoT environments and offering robust support for traffic management and security in real-world IoT deployments. The proposed method utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate between virtual private network (VPN) and non-VPN traffic. First, the communication traffic data are cleaned using an amplitude-limiting filtering technique to remove noise. The cleaned data are then divided into subsets for preprocessing. Next, a deep learning model is trained using the ISCX VPN–nonVPN public dataset, which integrates both spatial and temporal features of traffic data. Finally, the model leverages the parameter-sharing capability of neurons in the CNN’s hidden layers, reducing the number of trained parameters and significantly improving classification performance. Considering the development of new technologies such as VPN intelligent deployment and IPsec policy automatic generation, the research results of this study will accelerate the automation and intelligence transformation of the IoT ecosystem from deployment to management."

Bearings primarily fail due to defects such as inner ring faults, outer ring faults, and rolling element faults. Unlike traditional vibration signal analysis, deep learning techniques combining convolutional neural networks with short-time Fourier transforms have been known to classify even minor defects. However, previous studies have not been conducted under conditions that strongly cause overfitting. This paper mainly discusses about how to prevent overfitting in convolutional neural networks for bearing fault mode classification. We constructed a dataset with simultaneously measured axial and radial acceleration signals during bearing operation. Simple signal analysis showed that two different signals are physically very similar, confirming that differences in training and validation performance due to changing measurement directions indicate overfitting. In this paper, we prevented overfitting and improved performance using a convolutional neural network based on auto-encoders."

Traditional methodologies involve detailed analysis of texts to understand their themes and artistic techniques but are limited by subjectivity and bias. In contrast, AI and data analysis methodologies use text mining, natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, and network analysis to analyze vast amounts of text data quickly and efficiently. These methodologies offer the advantage of objectively analyzing themes, sentiment tones, and character relationships, and discovering new insights, but may not fully capture the nuanced meanings and artistic value of literary works. Therefore, combining the strengths of traditional methodologies with AI-based approaches is crucial when analyzing literary works. Particularly, research combining AI and data analysis with Chinese literary text analysis is still scarce, highlighting the need for further studies employing various text analysis methods."

To do so, we examined examples ranging from experimental projects that pioneered computational photography in the 1990s, to computer vision techniques, to art projects using generative adversarial neural network models since the 2010s, and analyzed the structural homologies between them from a techno-aesthetic perspective. Art ex machina, machine-made art that generates new images through machine learning based on the quantitative expansion of vast amounts of image data, creates a mechanism with its own life force through new permutations between huge image data. This creative structure is summarized as an autonomous cybernetic, or bio-cybernetic reproduction that is outside the realm of human programming. From this perspective, a meta-image, which is the relationship between image data, is not a simple replication of past data, but a newly created de-bordered image between data and data. As a result, the key to the relationship between bio-cybernetic reproduction and meta-image is that the two concepts are complementary. The bio-cybernetic reproduction mechanism, which can be recognized as a new creative subject and ecosystem, is the evolution of a meta-image from a simple relationship of inanimate individual data."

By exploring these theories, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of symbols in Christian education and their impact on the learning process. This study is divided into two main parts. In the first half, it examines the meanings of symbols and their functions as discussed by prominent scholars from various disciplines who have paid attention to symbols, including S. Freud and C.

Traditionally, the widely used SARIMAX model considers the seasonality, trend, and exogenous variables of time series data but has limitations in capturing nonlinear patterns due to linear assumptions. In contrast, recurrent neural network models based on deep learning, especially GRU, are attracting attention for their ability to effectively model nonlinearity. This study aims to improve time series prediction accuracy by proposing a Stacked SARIMAX-GRU model that combines the linear prediction ability of the SARIMAX model with the nonlinear prediction ability of the GRU model. This model enhances prediction accuracy by using the results of the two models as input to the metamodel through the stacking technique. Empirical analysis confirmed that the proposed model showed better prediction performance than using the existing SARIMAX and GRU models alone, with reduced errors such as MAE, MAPE, and RMSE, and a higher R-squared value."
"Advancement and Applications of Forest Remote Sensing in Korea: Past, Present, and Future Perspectives",2024,"['Forest remote sensing', 'CAS500-4', 'Forest disaster', 'Forest ecosystem', 'Forest resources', 'F-ARD']",,"Korea’s forest remote sensing began in the 1970s with the nationwide forest resource survey using aerial photographs, during which forest-type map and national forest resource data were produced for the first time. This data served as a crucial foundation for forest restoration and management at that time. In the 1990s, Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) were used to survey forest resources across North Korea, revealing for the first time the extent of forest degradation. Since then, satellite imagery has been regularly used to monitor North Korean forests, a practice that continues to this day. Since the 2000s, high-resolution satellite imagery from the Korean Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT) series and Satellite pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT), along with Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology, has enabled precise analysis of forest resources. Furthermore, digital twin technology has been applied to simulate forest resource information in 3D, enabling more accurate management. Recently, deep learning and other artificial intelligence technologies have been combined with research on forest resources, forest disasters, and forest ecosystem monitoring. A significant research focus has been on creating a carbon map that spatiotemporally assesses the absorption and emission of carbon dioxide in forests. Monitoring North Korean forests also remains a critical source of data for establishing inter-Korean forest cooperation policies. The necessity of Forest Analysis Ready Data (F-ARD) has also increased. F-ARD simplifies complex preprocessing, enhancing the utility of forest remote sensing data. The F-ARD produced by the Compact Advanced Satellite 500-4 (CAS500-4, Agricultural and Forestry Satellite) will serve as a new tool for forest analysis by providing geometrically and atmospherically corrected high-resolution satellite imagery with gap-filling capabilities. The CAS500-4 set to be launched soon, will capture daily images of the Korean Peninsula, playing a crucial role in urgent responses to forest fires and forest disaster management. This satellite is expected to significantly contribute to the management of Korean forests and responses to climate change."

Accordingly, many studies are using hardware accelerators for quick and accurate calculations. However, the performance bottleneck is due to data movement between the hardware accelerators and the CPU. In this paper, we propose a data prefetch strategy that can efficiently reduce such operational bottlenecks. The core idea of the data prefetch strategy is to predict the data needed for the next task and upload it to local memory while the hardware accelerator (Matrix Multiplication Unit, MMU) performs a task. This strategy can be enhanced by using a dual buffer to perform read and write operations simultaneously. This reduces latency and execution time of data transfer. Through simulations, we demonstrate a 24% improvement in the performance of hardware accelerators by maximizing parallel processing with dual buffers and bottlenecks between memories with data prefetch."

Since the memory requirementsand computational scale of large language models are much larger than those of traditional deep learning models, their executionperformance is highly dependent on the workloads they are running with. In current large language models, multiple executionthreads continue to occupy the CPU while the threads that have completed their tasks are in a busy-wait state. Therefore, in amulti-workload environment, there is often a state of contention for CPU usage between working threads. To overcome this, wehave improved the execution method so that the thread that completes the computation first can immediately return the CPUwhile waiting for data-dependent tasks to complete. In environments where there are more workloads running than there areCPUs in the system, we've seen up to a 9x performance improvement over the previous approach."

Evaluation and Prediction of Post-Hepatectomy Liver Failure Using Imaging Techniques: Value of Gadoxetic Acid-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging,2024,"['Liver cancer', 'Post-hepatectomy liver failure', 'MRI', 'Gadoxetic acid']",,"Despite improvements in operative techniques and perioperative care, post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) remains the most serious cause of morbidity and mortality after surgery, and several risk factors have been identified to predict PHLF. Although volumetric assessment using imaging contributes to surgical simulation by estimating the function of future liver remnants in predicting PHLF, liver function is assumed to be homogeneous throughout the liver. The combination of volumetric and functional analyses may be more useful for an accurate evaluation of liver function and prediction of PHLF than only volumetric analysis. Gadoxetic acid is a hepatocyte-specific magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent that is taken up by hepatocytes via the OATP1 transporter after intravenous administration. Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging (MRI) offers information regarding both global and regional functions, leading to a more precise evaluation even in cases with heterogeneous liver function. Various indices, including signal intensity-based methods and MR relaxometry, have been proposed for the estimation of liver function and prediction of PHLF using gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. Recent developments in MR techniques, including high-resolution hepatobiliary phase images using deep learning image reconstruction and whole-liver T1 map acquisition, have enabled a more detailed and accurate estimation of liver function in gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI."

At the time, the engineers who actually built Western-style buildings were traditional Japanese carpenters. They learned Western architectural techniques in a short period of time and combined them with traditional Japanese wooden architectural styles and techniques to create a new style known as quasi-Western style architecture. The primary reason Japanese carpenters could create and apply Western-style architecture in such a short period of time was that the Western architecture introduced at that time was colonial-style wooden architecture. In Japan, which has a long tradition of wooden architecture, excellent building wood was produced in abundance, and afforestation technology had developed well before the medieval times. Based on a deep understanding of wood, traditional Japanese carpenters systematically developed and accumulated techniques to build wooden structures of various sizes and complex shapes up to the modern era. During the Edo period, various architectural technical texts were published, and a system was established for carpenters to win construction orders through technological competition. In modern times, just as Japan had adopted Korean and Chinese architecture in ancient and medieval times, it actively accepted and learned Western architecture according to its needs and made it uniquely Japanese. Based on this historical background, traditional Japanese carpenters were able to learn the construction technology of Western architecture in a short period of time and create a new style of quasi-Western style architecture."
Computation Offloading with Resource Allocation Based on DDPG in MEC,2024,"['Computation Offloading', 'DDPG', 'MEC', 'Resource Allocation']",,"Recently, multi-access edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technology to alleviate the computing burden of vehicular terminals and efficiently facilitate vehicular applications. The vehicle can improve the quality of experience of applications by offloading their tasks to MEC servers. However, channel conditions are time-varying due to channel interference among vehicles, and path loss is time-varying due to the mobility of vehicles. The task arrival of vehicles is also stochastic. Therefore, it is difficult to determine an optimal offloading with resource allocation decision in the dynamic MEC system because offloading is affected by wireless data transmission. In this paper, we study computation offloading with resource allocation in the dynamic MEC system. The objective is to minimize power consumption and maximize throughput while meeting the delay constraints of tasks. Therefore, it allocates resources for local execution and transmission power for offloading. We define the problem as a Markov decision process, and propose an offloading method using deep reinforcement learning named deep deterministic policy gradient. Simulation shows that, compared with existing methods, the proposed method outperforms in terms of throughput and satisfaction of delay constraints."

However, current research predominantly focuses on the efficiency of automation, with a lack of in-depth studies on user experience and service design. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting research where users directly experience and evaluate automated purchasing services.Methods: This exploratory research on IoT-enabled automated purchasing services is divided into two studies. The first study involved a deep analysis of existing e-commerce users’ purchasing experiences, assessing their perception and need for automated services. This was achieved using the FCB Grid measurement method and in-depth interviews. Based on this, the research team developed a minimum viable product (MVP) that allowed users to experience fully automated purchasing. The second study involved users actually experiencing the automated purchasing service, with their experiences evaluated through diary studies, surveys, and interviews.Results: In the first study, in-depth interviews and involvement assessments were conducted with 14 participants from 1-3 person households. Participants identified repetitive purchasing, inventory management difficulties, and the inconvenience of using various purchasing outlets as major issues with existing services. The involvement assessment revealed that the most suitable product group for automation was rational and low-involvement products. In the second study, another set of 10 participants experienced the automated purchasing service for six weeks, documenting and evaluating their experiences through diary studies. This process highlighted the participants’ system requirements and the need for personalized services, which significantly contributed to the formation of service design guidelines. These guidelines, based on insights from the participants’ experiences, suggest directions for the development of hardware, software, and overall service. Finally, the service received high scores in terms of ease of learning, satisfaction, usefulness, and ease of use, as confirmed by the USE (Usability, Satisfaction, and Ease of use) evaluation survey.Conclusions: This study analyzes users’ expectations and needs for IoT-based automated purchasing services from the perspective of involvement and explores the potential of the service through long-term actual use experiences. The research provides directions for the development of fully automated purchasing services, contributing significantly to future research and service development."

Therefore, while research on haze removal algorithms using machine learning and deep learning techniques is actively conducted, obtaining a sufficient amount of data sets for training realistically is challenging. For this purpose, this paper proposes methods of generating haze synthetic images using random noise with Gaussian distribution or Standard uniform distribution. When the haze distribution is uniformly spread overall, haze is generated by creating random noise, followed by normalization and low-pass filtering. When the haze distribution is localized, haze is generated using filtering in frequency domain and low-pass filtering in the spatial domain. The proposed methods allow users to select the desired haze distribution and generate haze synthetic images with the desired density using simple formulas. Additionally, experiments have shown that when using Gaussian distribution, denser haze generation is possible compared to standard uniform distribution."

This paper proposes a driver identification system using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) that learns signal patterns according to time changes and a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory(BiLSTM) that learns long-term dependencies. The proposed identification system consists of a preprocessing process to remove noise from the signal, a feature segmentation process based on fiducial points and non-fiducial points, and a process to identify the driver using the TCN and BiLSTM ensemble models. Experimental results using the PhysioNet public databases, drivedb and normal sinus rhythm database, showed that the driver identification accuracy was 99.76% and 99.97% respectively, which is 4.64% and 3.84% better than the existing single network models."

However, if the background and object colors are similar or the background texture is complex, the model's accuracy deteriorates. To solve this problem, a deep learning model based on the region of interest has been developed, but when the background is complex, the image segmentation labeling task can be considered difficult in practice. Additionally, image segmentation maps have the disadvantage of insufficient information because they are expressed as binary values. Therefore, in this study, we would like to present a vision transformer that uses a class activation map instead of an image segmentation map. Through experimental results, the proposed model was able to capture regions of interest well even in images with complex backgrounds and achieved better accuracy than existing classification models for pest and fire blight datasets."

While there have been discussions on the detailed aspects of this interaction, discussion on a comprehensive theoretical perspective has not been sufficiently made. This study focuses on representational versatility as a theoretical perspective that allows for such comprehensive consideration and explores its roles in learning informal statistical inference. Following classroom design study method, a teaching experiment was conducted with third-year middle school students, revealing that representational versatility can support informal inferential reasoning by facilitating transitions between observing and acting upon representations, from surface to deep observation of representations, and between process and object perspectives on representations. Based on the analysis results, this study argues that the perspective of representational versatility helps in planning and analyzing the teaching of informal statistical inference by holistically considering the various aspects of interaction between students and data representations and by capturing the nuances of interaction transitions."

Currently, feed supply in aquaculture is primarily based on a fixed period and amount, depending on the predetermined feed quantity set by the operator, which does not consider the dynamic feed supply needs of fish. This can lead to under- or oversupply of feed, affecting the fish growth rate and water quality in aquaculture. To address this, a method is proposed in this paper to identify fish hunger levels using machine vision and predict the dissolved oxygen concentration in real time to prevent mass fish mortality due to water quality deterioration, even with additional feed supply. The method aims to verify its performance. Firstly, based on the observation that aquaculture farm operators estimate fish hunger levels by feeding time, a method is proposed to estimate hunger levels using machine vision and feeding time. Next, a combination of time series data decomposition model and pre-trained deep learning model is used to predict the dissolved oxygen concentration in real time."

Art education as a practice of social justice is not an exploration of beautiful colors or shapes, but a practice linked to life that continuously communicates and solves problems that can become social issues. Accordingly, through the philanthropy design project, problems are found in socio-cultural aspects, public interests are pursued, and problems are solved with novel and original designs. In particular, this study was designed to provide in-depth education by organically linking the content elements of knowledge and understanding, process and function, and value and attitude in the 2022 revised curriculum, ‘Teaching and Learning in School Curriculum Design and Operation.’ In the first stage (emotion), the class was developed as a student- participatory class, which provided students with a deep experience related to life. In the second stage (cognitive) area, the procedural knowledge of process and function enhanced cooperation and creative problem-solving skills, and in the third stage (behavioral) area, the ability to practice social justice linked to life was demonstrated by internalizing it in terms of values and attitudes."

A survey was conducted with 48 professors from Japan-related departments in four-year universities nationwide. The results revealed that interest in changes to the secondary education curriculum and the recovery of Japanese language status was not necessarily high. Additionally, many professors expressed the need for collaboration between secondary and higher education as well as cooperation among local communities, high schools, and universities. They also showed interest in the universities’ role in addressing the declining academic levels of incoming students and enhancing their capabilities. Furthermore, some professors emphasized the importance of deep learning focused on strengthening the abilities of Japanese majors, expanding practical education programs, and developing career and employment programs aimed at improving professional skills, rather than focusing solely on collaborative education between high schools and universities."

At the time of the invention of photography and cinema, the field of 'automatic creation' was established for them in comparison to traditional art genres such as painting. Recently, as AI has been applied to video production, the concept of 'automatic creation' has been expanded, and experimental creations that freely cross the boundaries of literature, art, photography, and film are active.  By utilizing technologies such as machine learning and deep learning, AI automated creation allows AI to perform the creative process independently. Automated creation using AI can greatly improve efficiency, but it also risks compromising the personal and subjective nature of art. The problem stems from the fact that AI cannot completely replace human creativity."

In such environments, handling users' diverse data requires an efficient network configuration of data centers composed of numerous servers, rather than a single server. However, traditional network methods are vendor-dependent, managing each server individually, which increases the management overhead for data center servers. To address this efficiently, SDN technology has gained attention, emphasizing the importance of load balancing techniques for handling data requests across servers. This paper proposes a load balancing technique that addresses these delay issues by monitoring server load levels and redirecting data processing to other servers with relatively lower loads when a server reaches a certain threshold, thereby enhancing the availability of all servers. Specifically, by automatically calculating and dynamically applying thresholds based on the average load of all servers, the proposed method aims to achieve optimal load balancing for the current network traffic. Through the experiment, it was confirmed that the server's load rate did not exceed the threshold and become overloaded. In the case of the comparison method, with a fixed threshold, one server's load rate increased to 96.39% when a large number of packets were received. However, with the proposed method, all servers recorded a load rate of below 90%. This demonstrates that optimal load balancing is achieved without the administrator needing to find the optimal threshold."

Homomorphic encryption (HE) can resolve the concerns by allowing cloud servers to compute on encrypted data without decryption.However, due to the huge computation overhead of HE, simply executing an entire cloud program with HE causes significant computation.Manually partitioning the program and applying HE only to the partitioned program for the cloud can reduce the computation overhead.However, the manual code partitioning and HE-transformation are time-consuming and error-prone. This work proposes a newhomomorphic encryption enabled annotation-guided code partitioning compiler, called Heapa, for privacy preserving cloud computing.Heapa allows programmers to annotate a program about the code region for cloud computing. Then, Heapa analyzes the annotatedprogram, makes a partition plan with a variable list that requires communication and encryption, and generates a homomorphic encryptionenabledpartitioned programs. Moreover, Heapa provides not only two region-level partitioning annotations, but also two instruction-levelannotations, thus enabling a fine-grained partitioning and achieving better performance. For six machine learning and deep learningapplications, Heapa achieves a 3.61 times geomean performance speedup compared to the non-partitioned cloud computing scheme."

As attention is drawn to these external distractions, it becomes challenging to listen to one's inner voice, leading to a sense of losing oneself. To rediscover oneself, a period of silence, where one concentrates deep into their inner being, is essential. Silence can be categorized into externally imposed silence and voluntary, chosen silence. Historically, women have been forced to keep in silence, with figures such as Catherine of Siena in the 14th century and Teresa of Avila in the 16th century also being compelled to remain silent by the Church. However, these women did not merely endure this imposed silence but instead engaged in voluntary and chosen practices of silence, such as prayer, meditation, and contemplation. Through these practices, they gained unique theological insights, transcended traditional theological boundaries, and voiced their creative and transformative ideas. For women to overcome imposed silence and find their true voice, paradoxically, the practice of voluntary and chosen silence is necessary. The silent practices of Catherine and Teresa serve as valuable guides for the spiritual lives of modern women. Like them, one can experience deep communion with God in silence, focus on inner voices to expand self-knowledge, practice empathetic listening for others, critically reflect on the world's issues, and learn to coexist with the wisdom of nature. For spiritual maturity, it is important to draw wisdom from the lives and teachings of spiritual foremothers and to create and practice moments and spaces of silence in one's own unique way."

Specifically, we reveal the structure of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), trace its technical improvement process in detail, and classify the types of subsequent models developed later. The tasks performed by GAN’s successor models are diverse. GAN is steadily evolving, completing amazing tasks that were impossible with existing generative models, such as high-resolution image generation, image substitution such as drawings and photos, and face synthesis. The principles of GAN are, first, data learning through adversarial competition between generator and discriminator, second, calculation of accurate probability distribution through Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and third, calculation of fine features of images through deep convolution structure. The most important characteristic of GAN as a generative model is its ability to create realistic images similar to photographs. Humans have been producing images using hands and tools, but with the invention of photography, humans began producing images using camera devices. Now, generative artificial intelligence is becoming another means of image production as technology continues to improve rapidly."

SR-IOV is a virtualization support function that takes direct access to PCI devices, thusgiving a high I/O performance by minimizing the need for hypervisor or operating system interventions. With SR-IOV, network I/Oacceleration can be realized in virtualization systems that have relatively long I/O paths compared to bare-metal systems and frequentcontext switches between the user area and kernel area. To take performance advantages of SR-IOV, network resource management policiesthat can derive optimal network performance when SR-IOV is applied to an instance such as a virtual machine(VM) or container arebeing actively studied.This paper evaluates and analyzes the network performance of SR-IOV implementing I/O acceleration is comparedwith Virtio in terms of 1) network delay, 2) network throughput, 3) network fairness, 4) performance interference, and 5) multi-network.The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, the network I/O process of Virtio and SR-IOV was clearly explained in the virtualizationsystem, and second, the evaluation results of the network performance of Virtio and SR-IOV were analyzed based on various performancemetrics. Third, the system overhead and the possibility of optimization for the SR-IOV network in a virtualization system with high VMdensity were experimentally confirmed. The experimental results and analysis of the paper are expected to be referenced in the networkresource management policy for virtualization systems that operate network-intensive services such as smart factories, connected cars,deep learning inference models, and crowdsourcing."

This process has consistently raised concerns regarding time costs and the risk of incidents. To address these issues, simulations of heavy equipment are conducted using Speedgoat and the Simulink API. However, due to the varying compatibility of different versions of Speedgoat hardware and Simulink API, engineers need to have a comprehensive understanding of various Simulink APIs. It is practically challenging for engineers, who must have a deep understanding of heavy equipment structures, to also possess programming skills including API usage. Thus, this paper proposes a tool that allows inputting configuration values for heavy equipment simulation and visually outputs and logs the simulation results. The proposed tool provides functionalities to deliver configuration values, such as engine settings of heavy equipment, to the simulator model and to monitor and log the resulting simulation outputs. These functionalities have been validated through scenarios. By using the developed tool, engineers are expected to reduce the burden of learning Simulink API and focus more on understanding the structure of heavy equipment. Additionally, it is anticipated that this tool will provide a more efficient and safer working environment for heavy equipment testing on construction sites."

The operating environment and load usage conditions are analyzed. The initial capacity was measured through full charge/full discharge experiments, and the battery capacity after the experiment was measured and used as training data. During railway vehicle operation, the battery load characteristic is that power is supplied through the charger, except in certain sections. Battery usage is extremely short compared to the operating time, and fl oating charging is constantly performed through the charger. Under these conditions, a battery aging experiment was conducted over 500 cycles. To minimize the impact of aging due to capacity measurements, the battery’s capacity was measured every 100 cycles. The experiments were performed at room temperature to replicate conditions similar to those of actual vehicles. The acquired data were preprocessed to enhance the accuracy of state of health (SoH) estimation. The SoH of the battery was then estimated using a long short-term memory model, which is a type of deep learning recurrent neural network."

Accordingly, the direction of urban regeneration projects must also seek ways to change according to changes in the social structure. This is a matter of justification for applying changes in economic activities and consumption patterns according to population changes and environment in the country and region. Measures to strengthen urban and regional competitiveness should promote regional revitalization through restoration of spatial characteristics. The new measures must meet the basic meaning and purpose of urban regeneration for regional reinvention and revitalization. Social values continue to be discussed on various concepts of openness and democracy, social quality, equity, and sustainability. Looking at the bills related to social values, the Social Value Act (draft) is still pending in the National Assembly. However, the ESG 4 Act, the Public Institution Operation Act, the National Finance Act, the National Pension Act, and the Procurement Business Act, are all in effect as of January 2024. The common social items of the 'ESG 4 Act' are the pursuit of equality and diversity. The characteristics of social values are summarized as publicity, liquidity, consultation, and diversity. Discussion of the concept of social value in Korea began with the promise of state administration when the Moon Jae In government was inaugurated, focusing on 'improving the quality of life of the people'. Currently, various methods of measuring social values are being discussed, but problems of standardization, and flexibility requirements for measuring social values are exposed. Therefore, the development of a new value measurement methodology through artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning is being prepared. In urban regeneration, social value practice is practiced through social inclusion and urban regeneration projects applying social values. In urban regeneration, the subjects of social value practice are local people, who are social capital, and the stakeholders of the target site. The practice of social value is expressed by the participation of the social capital, which is the resident of the target site. For social capital, the scale of the network and the measure of trust are important. In Korea, it is proposed to newly discuss ways to practice social values using collective impact. Collective impact is a method of solving common problems through joint goal building, collaboration, and solidarity. This will be an alternative methodology for realizing social value practice in urban regeneration based on a shared system, reinforced complementary activities, and continuous communication."

The meeting was the naming ceremony of AI and the launch of a new discipline. Leading the meeting were John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky.Along with Herbert Simon and Alan Newell, the Dartmouth Four have been hailed as the founders and pioneers of AI. But the researchers behind the success of neural network-based AI, and more notably deep learning, probably disagree with this interpretation. The groundwork of the new AI, represented by neural networks, robotics, and artificial life, was laid by cybernetics in the 1940s. Launched in 1956, AI focused on simulating human intelligence with digital computers, among the many prospects of machine intelligence presented by cybernetics.Early AI, now called GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI), rejected the tradition of cybernetics while establishing its institutional foundations and persecuting neural networks and artificial brains. This paper draws attention to the history of the time when AI was born in 1956, examines what happened on the path from cybernetics to AI, and why the pioneers of AI tried to distinguish themselves from cybernetics and sever its academic connection."

To this end, a control system is being introduced that automatically measures the number of captured pests using digital traps, breaking away from the conventional method of visual measurement by skilled farmers. However, the accuracy of pest counting is decreasing due to the problem of occlusion of captured pests. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a pest counting model consisting of a stacked density map-based counter and a kernel generator. In particular, we would like to propose a deep learning architecture that estimates spatially variable kernels for converting a dot map to a density map through a kernel generator and generates an adaptive density map from a counter. Through experimental results, the proposed stack structure-based kernel and density map generation model was effective even in pest images with occlusions and was able to improve accuracy by about 26% in mean absolute error compared to the existing pest counting model."

The research team utilized deep learning technology to accurately identify bibliographic information and collect 743 episodes of the series. Subsequently, based on the series’ creative methods and narrative structure, we analyzed the zeitgeist and cultural landscape of colonial Korea as reflected in specific episodes.We first explored how major historical events and institutional/social changes of the tumultuous 1920s were reflected in Meongteong’s daily life, analyzing the multifaceted clash between modern and traditional cultures. Next, we highlighted various episodes that showcase “Meongteongguri’s” unique commentary on the political realities of colonial rule, uncovering critical messages about imperialism and oppressive state power embedded in what has often been regarded primarily as entertainment comics. Lastly, by examining the new concepts of romance and modern family depicted in the series within their historical context, we investigated the changing family relationships and patriarchal structures of the time.In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the four-panel comic “Meongteongguri” is not merely a form of entertainment but a significant cultural-historical document that vividly captures the changes, conflicts, and colonial realities of contemporary Korean society. This research provides a foundation for a more nuanced understanding of the complex aspects of Korean popular culture during the Japanese colonial period and its historical context, while also underscoring the need for in-depth follow-up studies on the significance of “Meongteongguri” in the history of comics, culture, and journalism."

It is now time to consider how to coexist with AI in the realm of religion and ministry. This paper explores the challenges and issues that artificial intelligenceparticularly machine learning and deep learning applied to big dataposes to pastoral care and counseling. The researcher adopted a literature review methodology to analyze and review relevant studies for this research. Artificial intelligence is an engineering technology modeled after human brain neural networks and designed to perform information processing and intelligence roles similar to humans. The development of AI is closely related to the field of psychological counseling, and recently, it has been actively applied in psychological care and mental health, which involves managing human cognition, emotion, and behavior. When AI is used in pastoral care and counseling, its convenience and accessibility are valuable, offering advantages such as improving the training of pastoral counselors and increasing psychotherapeutic efficiency. However, there is also a risk that AI may limit the therapeutic relationship with the client, hinder the experience of God's presence, generate false information, raise human rights issues due to algorithmic bias, and raise ethical issues surrounding privacy and personal information. The use of AI in pastoral care and counseling raises critical questions: Can pastoral care ministries of healing, supporting, guiding, and reconciliation be effectively conducted using AI? Is pastoral counseling with spiritual discernment still possible?  The Korean church and the broader Christian community that practices Christian counseling urgently need to establish ethical guidelines and develop educational programs for the era of AI. They also need to cultivate professional pastoral counselors who are trained in Christian spirituality and scientific and technological approaches to AI."

The load tests are widely used to assess the serviceability and safety condition of bridges that are continually exposed to various forms of repeated loading. Recently, advancement in smart diagnostic technologies have introduced methods for assessing structural responses using image data. However, when utilizing image data, challenges such as distortions from lighting and angles, as well as difficulties in collecting information from blind spots, can hinder the comprehensive understanding of structural behavior. To address these limitations, this study presents an artificial intelligence (AI) based method for estimating vertical deflections using strain data measured during static tests on girders. The strain data were obtained from load tests conducted on 11 girders at the Hybrid Structural Testing Center of Myongji University. The deep learning model was developed using a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, with multiple input parameters including girder type, static load, and strain data. The performance of AI model was further enhanced through hyperparameter optimization, and its accuracy was verified through consistency evaluation. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated by analyzing prediction accuracy and computational time in relation to the quantity of training data."

However, frequent accidents occur due to deviation in construction design planned by inaccurate location information of underground structure. Meanwhile, the electrical resistivity survey, knowns as non-destructive method, is based on the difference in the electric potential of electrodes to measure the electrical resistance of ground. This method is significantly advanced with multi-electrode and deep learning for analyzing strata. However, there is no study to quantitatively assess change in electrical resistance according to geometric conditions of structures. This study evaluates changes in electrical resistance through geometric parameters of electrodes and structure. Firstly, electrical resistance numerical module is developed using generalized mesh occurring minimal errorsbetween theoretical and numerical resistance values. Then, changes in resistances are quantitatively compared on geometric parameters including burial depth, diameter of structure, and distance electrode and structure under steady current condition. The results show that higher electrical resistance is measured for shallow depth, larger size, and proximity to the electrode. Additionally, electric potential and current density distributions are analyzed to discuss the measured electrical resistance around the terminal electrode and structure."

In healthcare, it aids in the early diagnosis and treatment of diseases and surgeries.However, the misuse of this technology has led to a surge in crimes involving the creation of deepfake pornography. Due to the nature of deepfake technology, it is challenging to identify the responsible parties, and its decision-making processes often lack transparency. The rapid spread of content online, along with the use of overseas servers, further complicates legal regulation. As a result, the current legal framework has limitations in fully addressing defamation caused by deepfake pornography.To prevent the misuse of deepfake technology, comprehensive measures are needed across legal, technical, and societal dimensions. Regulations on deepfake pornography should be consolidated into a single law, and an independent oversight body should be established. Clear sanction measures against creators and distributors of deepfake pornography must also be defined, along with provisions for victim compensation.As deepfake technology continues to advance, its potential for misuse is likely to increase, posing severe threats to individuals' reputations. Once a reputation is tarnished, the damage can be nearly impossible to undo. Therefore, addressing defamation issues caused by deepfake pornography requires ongoing research and in-depth discussions."
객체 검출 알고리즘을 활용한 딥러닝 기반 상완 신경총 초음파 영상의 분할에 관한 연구,2024,"['상완신경총', '초음파영상', '객체탐지', '이미지분할', 'Brachial Plexus', 'Ultrasound Image', 'Object Detection', 'Image Segmentation']","초음파 유도 국소마취는 통증 관리와 회복 시간을 개선하여 말초신경 차단에 널리 사용되는 기법이다. 하지만 능숙한 임상의들에게도 초음파 영상에서 나타나는 speckle 및 Doppler와 같은 영상에 내재되어 있는 artifacts로 인하여 상완 신경총(BP; Brachial Plexus)의 정확한 검출 및 식별이 여전히 난제로 남아있다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위해, 우리는 다중 스케일의 접근법을 기반으로 하는 BP의 객체 검출과 그 결과로부터 U-Net 기반의 의미론적 영상 분할을 수행하는 small target 기반의 BP segmentation 알고리즘을 제안한다. 이를 위해 현재 BP 검출 및 식별은 다음과 같이 진행되었다: 1) 다중 스케일 기반의 RetinaNet 모델을 활용하여 BP 신경 영역을 대략적으로 특정하는 단계와 2) 객체 검출로부터 제한된 영상의 범위를 입력으로 U-Net을 활용함으로서 BP 신경의 영역을 검출하는 단계. 실험 결과는 제안된 모델이 분할 전용 모델 등의 경쟁 방법에 비해 BP 신경 영역을 대략적으로 특정하여 식별 범위를 제한함으로서 BP 신경 범위 분할의 정확도를 높이고 고품질 BP 분할을 생성할 수 있음을 보여준다.","Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia is one of the most common techniques used in peripheral nerve blockade by enhancing pain control and recovery time. However, accurate Brachial Plexus (BP) nerve detection and identification remains a challenging task due to the difficulty in data acquisition such as speckle and Doppler artifacts even for experienced anesthesiologists. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a BP nerve small target segmentation network by incorporating BP object detection and U-Net based semantic segmentation into a single deep learning framework based on the multi-scale approach. To this end, the current BP detection and identification was estimated: 1) A RetinaNet model was used to roughly locate the BP nerve region using multi-scale based feature representations, and 2) U-Net was then used by feeding plural BP nerve features for each scale. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model produces high quality BP segmentation by increasing the accuracies of the BP nerve identification with the assistance of roughly locating the BP nerve area compared to competing methods such as segmentation-only models."

CNN은 딥러닝 분야에서 이미지 분류 및 데이터 학습에 유용한 장점을 가지고 있다. 이 기법을 활용하여 UV LAMP로 특정 시간 동안 HDPE를 자외선에 노출시킨후, 부식된 이미지 데이터를 취득하고 훈련을 진행하였고 90% 이상의 정확도를 도출하였다. 연구 결과를 기반으로 선박 소재의 노후화를 예측하고, 이에 따른 폐선 처리 문제와 해상 환경오염을 사전에 방지할 수 있는 효과적인 방안을 모색할 수 있을 것으로 기대된다.","Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) materials, which are mainly used in ship manufacturing, provide excellent durability and impact resistance, but long-term exposure to ultraviolet rays causes serious deformation, which complicates the processing of closed wires and is pointed out as one of the main causes of marine environmental pollution. As a countermeasure against this, the use of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which is attracting attention as an eco-friendly and recyclable material, is increasing, but HDPE is also showing vulnerability to ultraviolet rays due to the limitations of heat resistance and weather resistance. In this paper, we apply the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an artificial intelligence technique, to analyze and predict HDPE corroded by exposure to ultraviolet rays over time. CNN has useful advantages for image classification and data learning in the field of deep learning, and through this technique, it was confirmed that after exposing HDPE to ultraviolet rays for a specific time using UV LAMP, it can be predicted with more than 90% accuracy by acquiring it with corroded image data and conducting training.

However, it often results in awkward images due to differences in brightness and color tones between the background and foreground. Image harmonization techniques aim to reduce this incongruity and have gained significant attention in the field of image editing. These techniques allow for realistic matching of color tones between the foreground and background. Existing deep learning models for image harmonization have shown promise in achieving harmonization performance through the use of large-scale training datasets. However, these models tend to exhibit poor generalization performance when the loss function does not effectively consider brightness or when the dataset has a biased brightness distribution. To address these issues, we propose an image harmonization scheme that is robust to variations in brightness. This scheme incorporates an LAB color space-based loss function, which explicitly calculates the brightness of a given image, and an LAB color space-based preprocessing  scheme to create a dataset with a balanced brightness distribution. Experimental results on public image datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits robust harmonization performance under various brightness conditions."

The results confirmed that incorporating creative experiential activities into the school curriculum was more meaningful than simply adding new activities. This requires deep reflection on the content and methods of education, and the overall values that school education should pursue. The curricular characteristics of the creative experiential activities confirmed in this study are as follows: First, creative experiential activities break away from existing subject-centered school education by including activities closely related to students' lives in the official curriculum. Second, they expand the depth and breadth of learning by building complementary relationships with subjects, while simultaneously increasing the flexibility and comprehensiveness of the curriculum. Third, they emphasize the subjectivity and creativity of the educational stakeholders by creating a curriculum that teachers and students develop together. This approach helps select educational content that reflects students' needs and interests, maximizing the meaning and value of learning through the curriculum. These characteristics suggest that creative experiential activities are vital educational assets that support students' holistic growth beyond simple extracurricular activities and play a complementary role in the curriculum."

The rise in dining-out prices, in particular, imposes a significant burden on the national economy. So, how much is the actual rise in food ingredient prices affecting the restaurant industry? And is the current price increase really reasonable? Additionally, if we can predict changes in dining prices through raw material costs, wouldn't consumers be able to make more informed decisions, and could this serve as a pricing indicator in the domestic restaurant industry? In this study, we adopt the aforementioned questions as our main research questions (RQs) and analyze how fluctuations in livestock prices impact the restaurant industry, focusing on dining prices. Additionally, we will develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these changes. Specifically, the study will identify and analyze factors in the distribution process that are expected to affect dining-out prices. Based on these results, it will ultimately analyze and predict dining-out prices. At this stage, fluctuations in livestock and dining-out prices will be analyzed separately for the Covid-19 period and the post-Covid-19 period. For this study, we have selected han-don (Korean pork), which is the most familiar food to our citizens, and specifically, we will use the dining-out price of the representative cut, samgyeopsal (pork belly). Specifically, the study will analyze the relationships between these variables and implement prediction models using techniques such as correlation analysis, OLS linear regression, ARIMA, and VAR, which are commonly used in time series data analysis. Additionally, deep learning prediction models will be developed using LSTM and GRU models. The study clarifies the relationship between the farm gate price of han-don (Korean pork) and the dining-out price of samgyeopsal (pork belly), and provides a clear analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on dining-out prices. Additionally, it implements significant prediction models. In conclusion, the models proposed in this study will enable small business owners to determine reasonable pricing points when making pricing decisions, and consumers can make informed purchases based on these decisions. Additionally, the government and public institutions can respond at a national level to price changes caused by trends and volatility in the prices of livestock raw materials. Ultimately, it is expected that utilizing this model can contribute to stabilizing the domestic restaurant industry and the national economy."

The act of worship not only holds educational effects in itself, but also the practice of liturgy and rituals inculcates faith within individuals and communities. Through Christian Education, believers learn the core truths of Christianity and experience the maturation of their faith, thereby becoming better worshippers for subsequent gatherings. Since the 1960s, John Westerhoff, recognizing this mechanism, has advocated for the formation and transmission of faith through community participation and the practice of liturgy and rituals. Liturgical theologians like Byron Anderson and Louis Weil have also pursued the integration of liturgical studies and Christian education, emphasizing the formative power of liturgical practice. This study will demonstrate that the practice of liturgy and rituals not only enhances learning and understanding but also greatly benefits the formation of individual and communal memory and identity. I will particularly show the deep educational significance inherent in these practices. By doing so, I will show unfamiliar terms in Protestant traditions, such as liturgy and rituals that not only shape the believer’s faith but also facilitate natural faith transmission to the next generation. In this article, I will insist scholars researching worship must possess educational literacy, and those specializing in Christian education must recognize that when they have a theological and practical understanding of liturgy, they can foster true worshippers."

In particular, sensory experiences that involve physical action can have a significant impact on children's creative development and spatial cognition. In order to stimulate children's emotional resonance, and promote children's cognitive development to obtain a better space experience, the design of sensory experience space for children must be reflected as a key factor in promoting children's healthy growth and development including design-thinking abilities and critical problem-solving skills.  Therefore, this article studies the children's exhibition space through the review of precedent children's development theories  and domestic cases.  On this basis, the physiological, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics of children in the exhibition space are deeply studied.  Then, this study proposes a sensory experience space that is optimized for children’s physical and cognitive growth. (Method) First, this study analyzes the previous theoretical research results in the field of children's cognitive development, which systematically explains the process, characteristics, and spatial behavior patterns of children's cognitive development at different ages. Based on these theoretical foundations, we further identify design elements that guide and enrich children's sensory experience. Using the derived elements of sensory experience spaces as a framework for analysis, three existing exhibition spaces for children were analyzed. Through case studies, it was possible to discover the spatial elements, design composition, and improvement points required for dedicated exhibition spaces. (Results) By utilizing the three design elements (physical movement, cognitive thinking, and experiential behavior), the design can be driven to optimize children's sensory experience. In particular, to maximize the sensory experience, light, color, sound, materials, and objects were introduced into each space to stimulate cognitive development and behavior. Specifically, the reasonable use of light and color can adjust the space atmosphere and stimulate children's visual perception and emotional response. Sound design can add fun and encourage children to participate actively. The choice of materials and objects is directly related to children's physical movement and tactile experience, which promotes the deep integration of perception and cognition. (Conclusions) These sensory experience spaces for children will effectively meet their multisensory needs and stimulate their curiosity and desire to explore, which will help trigger not only physical development but also cognitive and psychological development. This proposal for a sensory experience space centered on children's spatial cognitive development may be significant in providing a basis for the design of children's experiential education space."

In order to apply such a scientific analysis technique, the quality and quantity of data are essential. Still, when the amount of data is insufficient, it is challenging to apply it to the scientific method. For example, data such as the macroeconomy are often set to have a relatively long period of data disclosure, or because the assets of real estate-related indicators among assets are very non-floating, the presentation period is often long. Therefore, in order to overcome the limitations of this data shortage, this study intends to study how to expand the existing time series through the TimeGAN model. A total of 50 time series related to economic indicators were collected on a monthly basis from 2013 to 2022, according to the data set, and a total of ten final time series were selected through the correlation between time series. As a result of expanding ten time series through the TimeGAN model, the similarity between the statistical distribution of the actual and extended data was proved based on the PCA and t-SNE visualization algorithms. Through this study, the possibility of overcoming various potential limitations arising from narrow data could be confirmed. Therefore, it is expected that this paper will be a positive reference in various future studies to overcome shortcomings such as data underfitting."

Fake news is viewed as a digital organism that feeds on human interest and emotions, and how the Generative AI can increase the production and propagation power of fake news is considered. Through literature review and case analysis, the main characteristics of the Generative AI that can be abused in the production of fake news were derived. Deep learning, natural language processing, and multi-modal content synthesis are representative. Based on this, a conceptual model was proposed to explain the life cycle of AI-generated fake news and the factors of propagation within the digital platform. The research results suggest that the Generative AI can greatly amplify the scale and persuasiveness of fake news by automatically producing realistic and emotionally stimulating content. It also highlights the importance of digital platforms and user actions in the spread of AI-generated fake news.

Those two pieces are ‘Jeongamdoinsigweonseo’ and ‘Jeongamdoinsiljeokchanbyeongin’.These two works were written when Kim Si-seup traveled to Seoul in the spring of 1471 and met Haemin, who was the chief monk at Jeongeupwon at the time. Haemin requested Kim Si-seup to write them. ‘Jeongamdoinsigweonseo’ is the preface to Jeongamdoinsigweon, and ‘Jeongamdoinsiljeokchanbyeongin’ consists of the praise (‘chan’) and postscript ('in') of Jeongamdoinsiljeok.‘Jeongamdoinsiljeokchanbyeongin’ refers to ‘Jeongamdoin’ whose Dharma name was Myobeop, courtesy name was Jeongam, and family name was Gu. His lifetime spanned from 1374 to 1449. In his life, he preached for the deceased King Taejong, led Lady Yi-bi Kwon to become a Buddhist nun, and composed Buddhist poetry while touring Mount Geumgang.In ‘Jeongamdoinsigweonseo', ‘Jeongamdoin' refers to Haemin. It was previously known through the records of the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty that Haemin served as the chief monk of Jeongeupwon around 1463 and died around 1473. The recent study of ‘Jeongamdoinsigweonseo' has revealed new facts about him. Haemin, whose courtesy name is Jeongam, belonged to the Yi clan of Taean. He learned Buddhism at the age of 13 from the aforementioned Gu clan, and in 1457, by the order of King Sejo, he became the first chief monk of the restored Jeongeupwon. After that, he received great respect as a renowned possessor of Buddhist teachings from royal family members including King Sejo and Queen Jeonghui. Jeongamdoinsigwon and Jeongamdoinsiljeok are works that can be attributed to the authorship of Haemin and Gu, respectively. From such cases, it is evident that nuns, like monks, engaged in compiling writings when they possessed high levels of scholarship and deep commitment to practice.Information on nuns from the early Joseon Dynasty and the chief monk of Jeongeupwon is almost entirely derived from the Annals and is mostly fragmentary. In this context, the two aforementioned texts left by Kim Si-seup could contribute significantly to a more in-depth understanding of the lives of early Joseon nuns and the status of the Jeongeupwon chief monk. For further discussion, the original manuscript facsimiles, modern typographic editions, and Korean translations of the two texts have been included in the appendix."

Jongmyo-Jeryeak education should target students in the 5th and 6th grades of elementary school and the 1st to 3rd grades of middle school. In the appreciation area, education should not only focus on the musical composition of Jongmyo-Jeryeak but also study its social and cultural background, enabling students to understand its significance in modern Korean and global contexts. In the performance area, students should learn music, singing, and dance separately and then be educated in ‘harmony,’ where the three types of arts are integrated through role division. Lastly, in the creation area, it is essential to enhance the understanding of traditional notation systems and produce individual musical outputs. This paper proposes rewriting the lyrics of the Jongmyo Jeryeak as an advanced activity. By focusing on the purpose and significance of Jongmyo-Jeryeak, students will create lyrics that praise the achievements of past kings and sing them to the music. Through these activities, students can gain a deep understanding of Jongmyo-Jeryeak and engage in lively discussions. Recognized as a significant cultural heritage of Korea, Jongmyo-Jeryeak is an excellent educational content that can be integrated with other subjects and allows for integrated education in music, singing, and dance."

Go is recognized as a unique cultural activity that goes beyond simple gameplay, encompassing deep thought, strategy, and psychological elements. However, existing research on Go has primarily focused on technical aspects and strategic methods, with a lack of in-depth studies on users' subjective perceptions and experiences. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the subjective perceptions of Go users to understand the significance and role of Go in contemporary society.The study was conducted with 30 Go players. Using Q methodology, 105 statements were collected and, after expert validation, 34 final statements were selected. Subsequently, a P sample was composed, and Q sorting was performed.Finally, factor analysis was conducted using the PQMethod statistical program.The results revealed that the perceptions of Go users could be classified into three types: 'Go Enthusiasts,' 'Intellectual Challengers,' and 'Educational Value Seekers'.The first type, 'Go Enthusiasts', emphasizes the strategic aspects of Go and the importance of human-to-human competition. The second type, 'Intellectual Challengers', perceives Go as a new intellectual challenge and seeks to develop logical thinking and intellectual abilities through it.

By selecting the Itaewon disaster as a case study, and by examining the distribution of images in the news reports, this study analyzed 1) whether disaster coverage shifts from eyewitness journalism to watchdog journalism over time, 2) the differences between broadcasters in terms of the distribution of image usages in the news report by days and news channels, and 3) the use of blurred images in the news report. We extracted keyframe images of all disaster coverage items from the evening main news programs of three terrestrial and three broadcast network channels for three days from the event. We have categorized the screens into 30 image clusters using deep learning and detected blurred images. The results showed that the reporting style shifted from an eyewitness journalism to a watchdog journalism practice over time, with fewer on-site images after the event and more images related to accountability and countermeasures as time passes. Nevertheless, the proportion of blurred footage within the shrinking cluster of footage did not change significantly. In terms of differences across news channels, the terrestrial broadcasters and general programming channels were distinguished from each other by differences in the distribution of coverage screens and the use of blurred screens in news visuals."

It also seeks to establish, as far as possible, the influence of such things on Wilhelm II’s beliefs, attitudes, feelings, disposition, and behavior. In doing so, I have attempted to supplement or criticize Röhl's views on the causes of the German emperor's vengeful, aggressive, and violent tendencies and behavior.As this research has shown, the education or instruction that Wilhelm II received encouraged in him, in various ways and at times relatively strongly or more strongly, in particular courage, racism, nationalism, patriotism, anti-Catholicism, anti-Semitism, a view of history as a struggle, expansionism, colonialism, the spread of Christianity, the maintenance and expansion of the fleet, the futility of dialogue, heroism, the futility of tolerance, hostility toward enemies, and cruel punitive, revengeful, and violent tendencies and behavior.In so doing, such instruction or instructional content appears to has influenced Wilhelm II to make the futility of tolerance, nationalism, monarchism, anti-Catholicism, anti-Socialism, anti-Semitism, anti-French, expansionism, colonialism, the propagation of Christianity and the building of a great fleet creeds to be pursued and continually and consistently demonstrate modeling and following heroes, heroism, and hostility to enemies, both foreign and domestic, and punitive, vengeful, and violent tendencies and acts, and, moreover, intense hostility and ruthless, cruel, destructive, murderous, slaughtering, genocidal, and exterminating punitive-revengeful-violent tendencies and acts.Wilhelm II's displeasure at having his ""Germanic feelings"" ""wounded"" by reading Caesar's Biography of the Gauls, which describes the Roman army's victory over the ancient Germanic peoples, taking no prisoners and committing genocide and satisfaction with the ancient Germanic victory over the brutally violent Roman army and extermination of it demonstrate to some extent that classical language education or educational content influenced the impressionable young Wilhelm II to exhibit hostility toward and ruthless, cruel, destructive, murderous, slaughtering, genocidal, and exterminating punitive-revengeful-violent tendencies and acts against the above-mentioned enemies.On July 27, 1900, more than 20 years after Getting a history education on Friedrich the Great or learning of it, Wilhelm II, in his ""Hun Speech"" at Bremerhaven, furiously declared that ""no leniency will be granted"" to the ""insolent,"" ""criminal,"" ""barbaric,"" murderous, and murderous enemy and no prisoners will be made"". This words is almost identical to the orders given by Friedrich the Great from history textbooks, as he and his troops fought with extreme hostility against the brutal Russian army that was ravaging Prussia, harming men, women, and children alike.This similarity once again proves that Wilhelm II loved, admired, modeled, and followed Friedrich the Great and his heroism. The similarity also proves in itself that such education or instructional content influenced Wilhelm II's behavior by conveying information about the feelings, dispositions, and actions of his ""hero"" Friedrich the Great, because an uninfluenced person would hardly say the same thing.The above discussion demonstrates that the education Wilhelm II received or learned was one of the sources of his aggressive, punitive, vengeful, and violent tendencies and behavior. Moreover, it appears to be a more important source than the manic-depressive or cyclical manic-depressive illnesses that Röhl claims as such a source."

The field of hand gesture recognition using surface electromyography (sEMG) has been studied to recognize these hand movements and use them as HCI (Human Computer Interface). Since electromyography signals basically have many noise elements, various pre-processing techniques have been developed to recognize hand gestures, and Wavelet Transform (WT) is frequently used for frequency analysis. Therefore, in this paper, three pre-processing techniques based on wavelet transform are compared to select the most suitable technique for the actual user-environment in the field of hand gesture recognition. Processing time and gesture recognition accuracy in each technique were compared for real-time recognition, which is the main goal of the field of hand gesture recognition, and the compared wavelet transform techniques are DWT (Discrete WT), TQWT (Tunable Q-factor WT), and CWT (Continuous WT). The dataset used in the comparison contains 15 hand gestures collected from five different subjects, first extracting features with each of the three techniques and recognizing hand gestures using a deep learning classifier (light CNN). In each process in which hand gesture recognition is performed, processing time is recorded, and finally, the average accuracy for 15 hand gestures is calculated. The results obtained similar average accuracy of about 75% in TQWT and CWT, but the time required for the recognition process was 0.08 seconds in TQWT and 0.26 seconds in CWT. Therefore, it was shown that TQWT with fast processing time is a suitable technique for the actual user-environment of hand gesture recognition, showing similar performance in terms of accuracy."
지시문을 활용한 동형암호 프로그램 코드 분할 컴파일러,2024,[],"클라우드 컴퓨팅이 널리 사용되면서, 데이터 유출에 대한 관심도 같이 증가하고 있다. 동형암호는 데이터를 암호화된 채로 클라우드 서버에서 연산을 수행함으로써 해당 문제를 해결할 수 있다. 그러나, 프로그램 전체를 동형암호로 연산하는 것은 큰 오버헤드를 가지고 있다. 프로그램의 일부분만 동형암호를 사용하는 것은 오버헤드를 줄일 수 있지만, 사용자가 직접 프로그램의 코드를 분할하는 것은 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업이고 또한 에러를 발생시킬 수 있다. 이 연구는 지시문을 활용하여 동형암호 프로그램의 코드를 분할하는 컴파일러인 Heapa를 제시하였다. 사용자가 프로그램에 클라우드 컴퓨팅 영역에 대한 코드를 지시문으로 삽입하면 Heapa는 클라우드 서버와 호스트사이의 통신 및 암호화를 적용시킨 계획을 세우고, 분할된 프로그램을 생성한다. Heapa는 영역 단위의 지시문뿐만 아니라 연산 단위의 지시문도 사용가능하여 프로그램을 더 세밀한 단계로 분할 가능하다. 이 연구에선 6개의 머신러닝 및 딥러닝 어플리케이션을 통해 컴파일러의 성능을 측정했으며, Heapa는 기존 동형암호를 활용한 클라우드 컴퓨팅보다 3.61배 개선된 성능을 보여주었다.","Despite its wide application, cloud computing raises privacy leakage concerns because users should send their private data to the cloud. Homomorphic encryption (HE) can resolve the concerns by allowing cloud servers to compute on encrypted data without decryption. However, due to the huge computation overhead of HE, simply executing an entire cloud program with HE causes significant computation. Manually partitioning the program and applying HE only to the partitioned program for the cloud can reduce the computation overhead. However, the manual code partitioning and HE-transformation are time-consuming and error-prone. This work proposes a new homomorphic encryption enabled annotation-guided code partitioning compiler, called Heapa, for privacy preserving cloud computing. Heapa allows programmers to annotate a program about the code region for cloud computing. Then, Heapa analyzes the annotated program, makes a partition plan with a variable list that requires communication and encryption, and generates a homomorphic encryptionenabled partitioned programs. Moreover, Heapa provides not only two region-level partitioning annotations, but also two instruction-level annotations, thus enabling a fine-grained partitioning and achieving better performance. For six machine learning and deep learning applications, Heapa achieves a 3.61 times geomean performance speedup compared to the non-partitioned cloud computing scheme."

Such complexity also introduces a potential for human errors. Therefore, it is necessary to devise an efficient system for analyzing such textual data. In this study, we propose a natural language processing (NLP)-based system that can predict judicial verdicts in traffic accident cases. The proposed system leverages NLP techniques to extract and analyze information related to traffic laws and regulations from textual descriptions of traffic accident scenarios, subsequently predicting sentencing information such as probation status and fines. The proposed system mainly consists of three parts: 1) data collection and preprocessing, 2) construction of a word dictionary and embedding, and 3) verdict prediction. First, traffic accident-related judgments are collected from various legal databases. Subsequently, key information such as imprisonment terms, probation status, and fines is extracted from the collected judgments, and a domain-specific word dictionary tailored to traffic accident cases is built using embedding techniques. Finally, the legal verdicts are predicted using a deep learning model. In our experiment, we validated the feasibility and applicability of the proposed system by implementing and applying it to approximately 37,406 traffic accident-related judgments, resulting in accuracies of 96.13%, 94.85%, and 95.49% for imprisonment, probation status, and fines, respectively."

Nonetheless, it is the first book to be published in Korea under the name of ‘manga,’ which has drawn attention to its unique qualities.This paper aims to elucidate the circumstances that brought Torigoe Seiki to Gyeongseong (京城) and the relationship between his painting and his influences. Torigoe was born into a poor family in Okayama and struggled to learn Chinese writing and painting. In Korea under Tongam-bu(統監府), when Gyeongseong Newspaper (京城日報) was founded, he was interviewed by newspaper company president in Tokyo, and on the recommendation of Kosugi Misei (小杉未醒), who was there at the time, he got a job at the Gyeongseong Newspaper.When Torigoe came to Korea, he painted in the style of Kosugi, a former soldier in the Russo-Japanese War. He painted the most spectacular events in Gyeongseong in the style of war reportage painting, and depicted Korean customs in the style of cut paintings of Kosugi.However, he focused the spectacle value of the events and Korean customs, rather than showing the same deep understanding of Korean sentiment or history that Kosugi did. This was because he had close ties to imperialist Japanese journalists in Korea, including the Gyeongseong Newspaper and “Chosun” Magazine.He also met Kitazawa Rakuten (北沢楽天) of Tokyo Puck (東京パック), who came to Seoul to cover the story, and was deeply influenced by the ‘manga’ style. In fact, it can be said that the stereotypes of men depicted in Choseon Manga were almost entirely based on Kitazawa’s manga style.However, similarly, he did not reach the level of satire that Kitazawa did for various reasons.Torigoe was adopted by the Hosokibara family when he came to Korea in 1908 and renamed Hosokibara Seiki (細木原靑起). In the spring of 1909, he returned to Japan and continued to work as an illustrator in Japan, and in 1924, he wrote a History of Japanese manga (日本漫畵史). During his stay in Gyeongseong, he had neither the understanding nor the original pictorial style to overturn the distorted image of Korea that had recurred since the Russo-Japanese War. However, he can be understood as one of the first instances which was able to draw attention to the connection between imperialism and image in Korea."

At the 2023 exhibition of SuwonHwaseong museum, the manuscript of Chae Paengyun’s collection of works was revealed. The woodblock version Huiamjib is in 29 volumes, while the manuscript version PyeChu is in 18 volumes. Although the number of manuscripts is small, the number of works is greater than the woodblock version. The main trends in works deleted when published from manuscript to woodblock edition are as follows.First, many daily literary exchanges with in-laws were deleted. His literary activities were often carried out together with his father-in-law and brothers-in-law. Most of these works were deleted, and when published, they were included sporadically without any context. Because of this, the background of literary activities is not well understood. The manuscripts provide data to specifically understand the spatial context of his literary activities.Second, the aspects of friendship with the same party writers involved in Tagnam or Musinlan were deleted or reduced. Chae passed the civil exam the year of Gisahwangug occurred and was selected for the Dogseodang. Most of the writers who were selected at this time were writers who were classified as Tagnam. He had a deep relationship with them, and this friendship is evidenced by manuscripts. In the woodblock version, their friendship is greatly reduced. This meant that his grandson categorized his grandfather as an Cheongnam and reduced the level of interaction during the political situation during the reign of King Yeongjo.Third, Chae’s aspect to educate his young students with care and nurture them into national talents in the future has been reduced. He put effort into nurturing younger students in an unfavorable political situation after Gabsulhwangug. Among those students was Chae Jegong’s teacher Oh Gwangun. PyeChu contains Oh’s name from his childhood, and expresses the special affection Chae had for him as a son. In the woodblock version, the works about Oh and other young disciples are greatly reduced, and Oh also appears by name as an adult. Repetitive works on poetry learning and daily life were eliminated, and works related to Chae’s disciples were organized, focusing on Chae Jegong’s teacher Oh."

With technological advancements overcoming the limitations of medical AI through training with databases, AI technology has made remarkable progress since the inception of deep learning for image processing with convolutional neural networks (CNN) in 2012. The recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have accelerated the utilization of AI through sophisticated natural language processing, enabling machines to identify and understand data regardless of the complexity of the language. This has laid the foundation for the rapid and precise development of generative AI. In the era where generative AI is being utilized without pausing in its developmental speed, we considered the civil liability of AI in our civil law principles, taking into account the inherent characteristics of AI such as unpredictability, opacity, and the black box effect.To do this, we first examined the legal liability considering the stages of AI technology development in discussing the tort liability caused by AI. Even “Weak AI,” created by AI developers, may fall under “Gefahr,” and while not all types, some may apply to strict liability in terms of risk liability. Furthermore, while reviewing civil liability applicable to AI under fault-based and no-fault liability, we also looked at the trends in the EU comparatively.In discussing no-fault liability, particularly under the Product Liability Act, we examined the possibility and implications of applying risk liability to pharmaceutical manufacturing using generative AI technology as a representative example to overcome the limitations of the existing Product Liability Act. Humanity currently lives in an era of rapid technological development and exploding big data, enjoying numerous benefits due to these advancements. As user convenience improves and massive added value is created through technological progress, the meaning of risk liability in the realm of civil liability can gain more significance. Generative AI has already drastically reduced the costs and time required for new drug development, providing substantial profits to pharmaceutical companies. However, even if the existing Product Liability Act is applied, it may be difficult to adequately remedy the harm to victims due to the reasonable alternative possibility defense regarding design defects. In the era of generative AI, we examined the possibility of applying enhanced risk liability by assuming the case of pharmaceutical manufacturing."

His cries are expressed in slightly different music depending on the object of loss and the situation. This study examined how the difference in concentration and texture is made in various musical expressions of sadness in pansori.Simcheongga was divided into four paragraphs based on the loss of Sim bongsa: i) the loss of Mrs. Kwak, ii) the loss of her daughter, Simcheong, iii) the loss of Mrs. Bbang-pa and his clothes, and iv) the restoration (復棋) of all the losses of Simcheong, who became an empress. Sim bongsa initially denies the situation and feels angry; however, she eventually negotiates and learns to accept it, but still suffers from depression.The pain she felt during the denial and anger stage was expressed in furious tears. Unorganized emotions are expressed in a confusing and complex rhythm, with the crying sound of screaming and stretching at a high pitch repeated multiple times. The mode mainly uses a Gye-meyon (界面調) mode of sadness. The ending in which a sound similar to a deep sigh is expressed instead of one that gives a sense of stability also matches the sentiment. Meanwhile, the negotiation and acceptance stage was expressed using a slower beat, with a stable rhythm. The mid-range was widely used by occasionally mixing major tones.ㅤ",

Chae Yong-shin's two portraits of Ki Woo-man was produced in October 1916 by Cho Yong-shin at the request of his disciples and followers.At the same time, it was confirmed through an letters between Yang Hoe-gap and Oh Dong-soo that Ki Woo-man's followers produced a portrait after several discussions in 1923 to promote the reproduction.Chae Yong-shin drew the costumes and posture of <Gosanseowon collection> and <Buguk Culture Foundation collection> differently. As a representing the ""Nosa school"" and a symbolic figure of Honam Confucianism, he wore deep robe <Gosanseowon collection> is a solemn and neat portrait with deep robe that can show the visualization of the academic background, and <Buguk Culture Foundation collection> in ordinary clothes shows Ki Woo-man's appearance as a Confucian scholar. It is believed that the reason why Chae Yong-shin produced the two portraits differently is because there was an intention of the academic group or the family that was the order.After producing the portrait of Ki Woo-man, Chae Yong-shin produced portraits of Ki Jeong-jin and Ki Woo-man followers, including Oh Jun-seon, Ko Gwang-seon, Shim Won-pyo, Chae Myeon-muk, and Wi gyeong-ryong. All of these were people who preserved modern Honam Confucian culture and led Confucian scholars while inheriting their academic background by cultivating their younger students through continuous academic activities. Chae Yong-shin showed characteristics by appropriately using their costumes and various items, giving each person's identity.

In this paper, we propose an approach that combines Resampling and Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation(ADDA) to comprehensively solve these problems. To alleviate the data imbalance problem, Resampling techniques ADASYN and Tomek Links were used, and an ADDA was introduced to overcome the limitations of new attack detection. The NSL-KDD qintrusion detection dataset was used in the experiment.As a result of the experiment, the proposed method was about 8% higher than the deep learning model learning result without applying Resampling and ADDA, and showed overall improved classification performance. This approach is expected to excel in intrusion detection, network in- cident response, and vulnerability analysis in defense cyber operations, and is expected to contribute to creating a more robust and secure digital environment for private and public sector cyber security."
기계 창작 시대 한시를 어떻게 향유할 것인가-한시 창작 AI에 대한 비판적 고찰-,2024,"['Sino-poetry database', 'Generative AI', 'AI Creating Sino-poetry', 'digital humanities', '九歌', 'SikuGPT2', '詩三百', '한시 데이터', '생성형 인공지능', '한시창작 AI', '디지털 인문학', '九歌', 'SikuGPT2', '詩三百']","본 글은 한시 창작 AI의 현황을 검토하고 향후의 가능성과 그 의미에 대해 논의한 것이다. 딥러닝 기술의 대두 이후 문화예술 분야에 대한 각종 창작 AI의 도전이 가시화되고 있으며, 한시에 대해서도 비슷한 시도가 포착되고 있다. 한시는 한자 문화권의 대표적 문예 양식으로서 함축과 풍격, 율격과 의상 등을 중시하는 그 특성으로 인해 창작 AI의 성능을 테스트하는 효과적 매개가 될 수 있다. 또한 창작 AI를 기동하기 위해서는 표준적 형식으로 구축된 대규모 한시 데이터셋(dataset)이 요구되는데, 중화권에서는 그러한 성격의 한시 데이터가 개방적으로 공유되고 있어, AI의 학습 데이터를 확보하기가 상대적으로 용이하다.현존하는 한시 창작 AI는 수십여 종에 이르며 <九歌>, <SikuGPT2>, <詩三百> 등이 그 대표적 사례에 해당한다. <九歌>는 청화대학교에서 제작한 창작 AI 및 구현 웹사이트로, 순환 신경망(RNN)의 방식을 사용하였다. 해당 창작 AI는 한시 약 80만여 수가 수록된 공개 데이터베이스를 활용하고 자체적으로 가공한 약 10만여 수의 한시 데이터베이스를 학습하여 이를 토대로 한시를 창작한다. <SikuGPT2>는 남경농업대학교에서 제작한 창작 AI로, GPT2의 인과 언어 모델(CLM) 방식을 사용하였다. 이 창작 AI는 한시 약 30만여 수가 수록된 공개 데이터베이스와 󰡔四庫全書󰡕 데이터베이스를 학습하여 창작에 활용하고 있다. <詩三百>은 언어 모델을 분명하게 제시하지는 않았으나, 위에서 언급한 공개 데이터베이스 외에도 대련 약 70만 연이 포함된 데이터베이스를 사용하고 있음을 밝히고 있다.한시 창작 AI는 AI 생성 모델(generative model)의 확장적 구현이라는 측면에서 일정한 의의를 지닌다고 해야겠으나, 점점 사멸해가는 한시 문학의 특성상 한시 창작 AI에 의해 창작된 작품은 의례적 칭찬 이상의 온당한 평가를 받기가 쉽지 않다. 다만 이로부터 몇 가지 시사점을 정리해보자면, 생성형 AI 기술을 테스트하는 과정에서 한시(근체시)라는 전통적 문예 장르가 유효하게 활용될 수 있다는 점, 한시 창작 AI를 구현하려면 본격적 학습 데이터로써 웹 표준 형식의 대규모 한시 데이터셋(dataset)이 구축되어야 한다는 점, 한시 창작 AI를 활용하는 과정에서 소위 ‘기계(machine)’를 매개로 한시에 관한 새로운 시각 및 통찰 등을 전달받을 가능성이 있다는 점 등을 예시해볼 수 있겠다. 그리고 현시점에서 상용화된 대표적 한시 창작 AI 플랫폼들로부터 ‘대동소이한 창작 경향’, ‘용사의 부재’, ‘율격에의 지나친 의존’ 등을 관찰할 수 있는데, 이러한 부정적 징후를 개선하기 위한 유효한 변수로 “고전비평” 데이터와 “사전류” 데이터를 추가 학습 자원으로 활용하는 것 등을 대안으로 생각해볼 수 있겠다.","This study examines the current status of Creative AI in Sino-poetry and discusses its future possibilities and implications. Since the rise of deep learning technology, various Creative AI challenges in the field of culture and arts have become visible, and similar attempts are being made in the field of Sino-poetry. Sino-poetry, a representative literary form of the East Asian culture, can be an effective medium to represent the performance of Creative AI due to its characteristics that emphasize connotation, style, rules, and images. In addition, genre big data based on web standard formats is required to trigger Creative AI, and Sino-poetry is fully equipped with this, making it very convenient to implement.There are dozens of Sino-poetry Creative AIs in existence, including <九歌>, <SikuGPT2>, <詩三百>. 九歌 is a Creative AI and implementation website created by Tsinghua University that uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) method. This Creative AI utilizes a public database of about 800,000 Sino-poetry and learns from its own database of about 100,000 Sino-poetry to create poems based on them. SikuGPT2 is a Creative AI created by Nanjing Agricultural University that uses GPT2's Causal Language Model (CLM) method. This Creative AI draws inspiration from extensive public databases, including around 300,000 Sino-poetry entries and the 󰡔四庫全書(Sikuquanshu)󰡕 database to fuel its creative processes. <詩三百> does not explicitly state its language model, but it reveals that in addition to the public databases mentioned above, it uses a 對聯(couplet) database containing about 700,000 couplet entries.While AI Creation for Sino-poetry has certain significance as a scalable implementation of AI Creative technology, the decline of Sino-poetry makes it difficult for the poems Created by AI to receive much more than cursory praise. Some takeaways, however, include the unexpected benefits of Sino-poetry in advancing Creative AI, the web-standardized format-based databases in China that have enabled rapid adoption of Creative AI, and the new context and insights that are generated in the process of guiding the training of Creative AI. In addition to the shortcomings commonly found in Creative AI, the work of Sino-poetry Creative AIs shows a tendency toward homogeneous creation, a lack of allusion, and an over-reliance on rules in Sino-poetry. Alternatives to these developmental weaknesses include using ""classical Sino-poetry criticism"" and accepting data from ""thesaurus"" as another valid variable in the function."

Various teaching methods have been used in literature education. For this study, Lectures, reading texts, discussions, and watching videos are used as teaching tools in literature class for university students. In addition, we explored how and to what effect the additional use of bibliodrama, which is widely used in psychotherapy and educational settings, would be effective. Bibliodrama was conducted two times for 120~150 min. each. A pre-post test was conducted to determine understanding of the author, work, and characters and the effects of insight and role training and various learning effects during and after the bibliodrama sessions. The learning effect significantly improved after the bibliodrama sessions.The results of the study are as follows. First, During class, learners can learn dramatic literature more happily and energetically, and feel various catharsis in the process. Second, Learners can feel and understand the entire work and its characters in a more three-dimensional and deeper way. Third, it provides opportunities for learners to experience personal insight and reflect on their lives through bibliodrama. Fourth, ‘Role Training’ is provided so that learners can develop the ability to respond flexibly and appropriately when they experience similar situations in reality by putting themselves into the situation. This shows that when bibliodrama is used as a teaching method, it can achieve not only a deep educational effect, but also a psychotherapeutic effect such as catharsis, insight and role training."

A study on the content of Korean spiritual culture education using Arirang : Focusing on the emotion of Han(恨),2024,"['한국어교육', '한(恨)', '아리랑', '정신문화', '문화교육', 'Korean language education', 'Han(恨)', 'Arirang', 'spiritual culture', 'cultural education']","배경: 본고는 한국어 학습자를 위한 한국의 한(恨)에 대한 정신문화 교육에 관한 연구이다. ‘정신문화’ 는 인간의 정신적 활동으로 형성된 문화, 도덕, 종교, 학술, 사상, 예술 등을 아우르는 말이다. ‘한국의 정신문화’는 한국인들끼리만 공유되고 있는 특별한 정신 활동이라 할 수 있다. 정신 활동에는 사람의 마음에 일어나는 여러 가지 감정 또는 감정을 불러일으키는 기분이나 분위기인 정서가 포함된다. 한국인 들이 ‘그렇게 언행 하는 것’을 알기 위해서는 그 언행을 하게 하는 정신 활동의 ‘기인이 어디에 있는 가’에 대한 이해가 있어야만 한다. 목적: 한국어교육에 있어 우리 삶의 표층을 이루고 있는 행동문화와 성취문화 못지않게 심층을 구성하고 있는 관념문화인 정신문화를 다른 영역에 앞서 교육할 필요가 있다. 가시적인 현상과 행동이 있게 하는, 어떤 일에 대한 견해나 생각 즉 ‘관념’은 사물을 느끼고 생각하며 판단하는 마음의 자세나 태도 즉 ‘정신’에 있다고 할 수 있기 때문이다. 따라서 아리랑이라는 교육자료를 활용하여 한국어 학습자가 접 근하기 어려운 한(恨)에 대한 정신문화 내용을 파악하여 한국어 학습자의 능통한 의사소통 능력과 문화 능력의 함양에 도움이 되고자 하는 것을 목표로 한다. 방법론/접근: 첫째 한(恨)의 정서에 대한 개념 정립하고, 둘째 아리랑의 형성과 유형을 살펴보고, 셋째 아 리랑의 내용 통해서 한국의 정신문화 교육으로 한(恨)의 내용을 분석하였다. 결과/결론: 한국적 한(恨)의 정서를 이해하기 위해 아리랑의 내용을 분석하였다. 결과 정선아리랑은 망국 의 나라를 지켜볼 수밖에 없는 충신의 한(恨)이, 밀양아리랑은 절개를 지킨 아랑의 한(恨)이, 진도아리랑 은 오랜 역사 속에 지켜낸 삶에 대한 애환의 한(恨)이 고스란히 담겨 있었다. 한국어 학습자는 아리랑의 사설을 통해서 한(恨)을 이해하는 데 도움을 받게 될 것이며, 나아가 한국어 능력 향상에 도움을 받게 될 것이다. 이에 아리랑은 한국적 한(恨)의 정신문화 교육 확장 및 연계성을 갖기에 충분하다. 시사점: 아리랑의 사설을 통해 한국의 한(恨)의 정신문화 교육의 확장 및 연계성을 확인할 수 있으며 한 국어 학습자를 대상으로 보다 심도 있는 정신문화 교육의 가능성을 시사한다.","Background: This paper is a study on the spiritual culture education about Korean han (恨) for Korean language learners. ‘Mental culture’ encompasses culture, scholarship, ideology, religion, art, and morality achieved through human mental activities. ‘Korea’s spiritual culture’ can be said to be a special mental activity shared only among Koreans. Mental activity includes emotions, which are moods or moods that evoke various feelings or emotions that occur in a person's mind. In order to know why Koreans ‘say things like that’, there must be an understanding of ‘where the origins’ of the mental activities that lead to those words and actions lie. Purpose: In Korean language education, it is necessary to prioritize mental culture, which is the ideological culture that forms the deep layer, as much as the culture of behavior and achievement that forms the surface layer of our lives. This is because the opinion or idea, or ‘idea,’ about something that causes visible phenomena and actions can be said to be in the ‘spirit,’ or the attitude or attitude of the mind that feels, thinks, and judges things. Therefore, by using the educational material called Arirang, the goal is to help Korean language learners learn the mental and cultural contents of Han (恨), which are difficult to access, and to develop fluent communication skills and cultural skills of Korean language learners. Methodology/Approach: First, the concept of the emotion of resentment is established, second, the formation and type of Arirang are examined, and third, the contents of the education of resentment are revealed through the contents of Arirang through the education of Korean spiritual culture. Findings/Conclusions: Jeongseon Arirang is the sorrow of a loyal subject who has no choice but to watch the country fall into ruin, Milyang Arirang is the sorrow of an Arang who maintained fidelity, and Jindo Arirang is the sorrow of the joys and sorrows of a life that has been preserved throughout its long history. It is fully contained. Arirang's editorials are sufficient to expand and connect the spiritual culture education of Korean resentment. Implications: Through Arirang's lyrics, we can confirm the expansion and connection of Korea's spiritual culture education of Han (恨), and suggest the possibility of more in-depth cultural education for Korean language learners."

Korea, which has consistently been evaluated as a top country, can clearly be said to be a leading country in the world of e-government. The lubricant of e-government is data. Data itself is neither information nor a record, but it is a source of information and records and a resource of knowledge. Since administrative actions through electronic systems have become widespread, the production and technology of data-based records have naturally expanded and evolved. Technology may seem value-neutral, but in fact, technology itself reflects a specific worldview.The digital order of new technologies, armed with hyper-connectivity and super-intelligence, not only has a profound influence on traditional power structures, but also has an a similar influence on existing information and knowledge transmission media. Moreover, new technologies and media, including data-based generative artificial intelligence, are by far the hot topic. It can be seen that the all-round growth and spread of digital technology has led to the augmentation of human capabilities and the outsourcing of thinking. This also involves a variety of problems, ranging from deep fakes and other fake images, auto profiling, AI lies hallucination that creates them as if they were real, and copyright infringement of machine learning data. Moreover, radical connectivity capabilities enable the instantaneous sharing of vast amounts of data and rely on the technological unconscious to generate actions without awareness. Another irony of the digital world and online network, which is based on immaterial distribution and logical existence, is that access and contact can only be made through physical tools. Digital information is a logical object, but digital resources cannot be read or utilized without some type of device to relay it.In that respect, machines in today’s technological society have gone beyond the level of simple assistance, and there are points at which it is difficult to say that the entry of machines into human society is a natural change pattern due to advanced technological development.This is because perspectives on machines will change over time.Important is the social and cultural implications of changes in the way records are produced as a result of communication and actions through machines.Even in the archive field, what problems will a data-based archive society face due to technological changes toward a hyper-intelligence and hyper-connected society, and who will prove the continuous activity of records and data and what will be the main drivers of media change? It is time to research whether this will happen. This study began with the need to recognize that archives are not only records that are the result of actions, but also data as strategic assets. Through this, author considered how to expand traditional boundaries and achieves reterritorialization in a data-driven society."
환웅의 홍익인간 이념 재해석과 생태학적 공생 가치,2024,"['홍익인간', '생태학적 공생', '홍익지구촌', '인류세', '특이점', '포스트휴먼', '전자인간', 'humanitarianism', 'ecological symbiosis', 'humanitarian global village', 'Anthropocene', 'Singularity', 'post-humans', 'electronic personhood']",,"This study aims to point out several problems in the existing theory of Hongik Human (humanitarianism) and reinterpret the humanitarian ideal based on the achievements of Hwanwoong, the main agent of this ideology. Further, the study identifies the value of ecological symbiosis from the perspective of bon-puri (Korean shamanic narratives or mythology) concept of history, and applies its usefulness to the post-human era. Since Hwanwoong, the son of the king of heaven, descended from heaven to earth to practice the spirit of humanitarianism. By retracing and analyzing his activities on earth, the true meaning of humanitarianism can be interpreted. The meaning will be discussed through both holistic interpretation based on the narratives of historical records related to the Hwanwoong bon-puri and analytical interpretation based on his specific activities.  From a holistic point of view, gods, humans, and animals in the Hwanwoong bon-puri exist relatively, but are all cyclical beings whose existence alternates between the three categories of entity. In the next life, the god may live as a human; an animal may live as a human; and a human may live as the god, freely crossing the boundaries between the three entities. Therefore, the essence of humanitarianism is that humans, gods, and animals are not differential but equal in relations by interacting with one another in a symbiotic manner.  From an analytical point of view, Hwanwoong practiced the spirit of sustainable symbiosis by adapting to the changing climate while controlling the wind and rain, doing farming in a symbiotic relationship with nature, and protecting the globe as a global village where all living creatures were connected to each other. When foreign immigrants, symbolized as the bear and tiger, came to Hwanwoong, not only did he help them get what they wanted on their side, but even when Ungnyeo (bear woman) asked him to marry her, he granted her wish after transforming into a human being, ultimately achieving a true symbiosis by breaking the barrier between the god and the animal. The generalization of the value of symbiosis implied in humanitarianism expands to the idea of ‘humanitarian global village’: dedicating yourself to benefit all things in heaven and earth.  Our global village is now facing a technological crisis in the context of ‘Singularity’ as well as an ecological crisis in the context of ‘Anthropocene’. If the crucial point of Singularity is reached in the future, considerable advances in artificial intelligence(AI) would far surpass human abilities; thus, humans could no longer keep AI under control. This state of emergency would inevitably lead to the advent of post-human era during which AI would be the dominant influence. The number of post-human populations, such as cyborgs and androids, would be growing quickly, and thus humans, who are of relatively low intelligence and physically weak, would inevitably give way to post-humans. Humans might be driven out of their jobs and get under the control of cyborgs and androids.  In that sense, the only way to prevent such a grim future for humanity is to realize symbiosis as the highest value. Humans’ pursuit of symbiosis with other living creatures can be applied to deep learning for AI because AI can learn the values sought by humanity. Therefore, instead of treating androids like servants, we should provide them with personality rights and find ways to have a symbiotic relationship with them as electronic personhood. Consequently, the ideology of humanitarianism, where symbiosis among humans, gods, and animals is valued, should be developed as an idea to overcome the ecological crisis, as well as an alternative to practice symbiosis between humans and electronic personhood in the future post-human era."
인공지능 산출물과 학습데이터에 관한 저작권 문제 고찰,2024,"['저작권법', '인공지능', '인공지능 산출물', '저작물성', '인공지능 학습데이터', 'Copyright law', 'Artificial intelligence', 'AI-generated work', 'Copyrightability', 'AI training data']","이 논문은 인공지능 산출물의 저작물성과 인공지능 학습과정에서의 저작권 침해 문제 두 가지 주요 쟁점을 심도 있게 분석하였다. 각국 판례와 입법례를 비교․분석하는 동시에, 국내외 학계의 다양한 논의를 소개하면서 관련 쟁점을 입체적으로 검토하였다. 첨단 인공지능 기술의 발전으로 창작 환경이 근본적으로 변화하고 있음에도 불구하고, 현행 저작권법은 인간 창작자 중심으로 설계되어 있어 한계가 있음을 지적하였다. 인공지능 산출물에 대해서는 저작물로서 보호할 만한 창작성이 인정되는지 여부에 따라 저작권 보호 여부가 결정되어야 한다는 기준을 제시하였다. 한국저작권위원회의 AI수로부인 편집저작물 인정 사례, 미국 저작권청의 인공지능 산출물 등록 거부 결정, 영국 저작권법상 컴퓨터생성 저작물 조항, 중국 법원의 인공지능 생성 이미지 보호 판결에 대한 분석을 통해 각국의 입장을 파악하고 시사점을 도출하였다.나아가 인공지능 학습과정에서의 저작권 침해 문제를 분석하였다. 인공지능 학습을 위해서는 방대한 양의 데이터를 수집․전처리하는 과정이 필수적인데, 이 과정에서 저작권 침해 문제가 발생할 소지가 있다. 학습데이터 이용 과정에서 저작권자의 이익이 과도하게 침해되지 않도록 하면서도, 딥러닝 목적의 저작물 이용에 관한 면책 범위를 합리적으로 설정할 필요가 있다. 현행 저작권법상 의거성과 실질적 유사성 요건을 충족하는 경우 저작권 침해가 성립할 수 있으나, 공정이용 법리에 의해 면책될 여지도 있다. 최근 미국에서는 인공지능 기업을 상대로 한 저작권 침해 소송이 다수 제기되고 있어 주목된다. 한편, 영국, EU, 일본 등에서는 TDM(텍스트 및 데이터 마이닝) 면책규정을 도입하여 일정한 요건 하에 저작물의 자유이용을 허용하고 있다. 우리나라에서도 TDM 면책규정 도입을 골자로 한 저작권법 개정안이 발의되었으나 제21대 국회 임기 만료로 폐기되었다. 인공지능 학습과정에 대한 저작권 규율은 기술혁신과 창작자 보호라는 두 가지 가치를 조화롭게 실현하는 것을 지향해야 한다.","This article provides an in-depth analysis of two major issues:the copyrightability of AI-generated works and the potential copyright infringement during the AI training process. By comparing and analyzing case laws and legislation from various countries, as well as introducing diverse discussions from the academic community, this article offers a multifaceted examination of the relevant issues. Despite the fundamental changes in the creative environment brought about by advanced AI technologies, the current copyright law, designed with a focus on human creators, has limitations. The article suggests that the decision to grant copyright protection to AI-generated works should be based on whether the creativity of the work is sufficient to warrant protection as a copyrighted work. Through a thorough analysis of the AI Madam Suro case recognized as a compilation work by the Korea Copyright Commission, the U.S. Copyright Office’s decision to refuse registration of AI-generated works, the computer-generated works provision in the U.K. copyright law, and the Chinese court rulings protecting AI-generated works, this article identifies the positions of different countries and derives implications.Furthermore, the article analyzes the issue of copyright infringement during the AI training process. The collection and preprocessing of vast amounts of data are essential for AI training, and this process may lead to potential copyright infringement issues. There is a need to establish a reasonable scope of exemption for the use of works for deep learning purposes while ensuring that the rights of copyright holders are not excessively infringed upon during the data usage process. Under the current copyright law, copyright infringement can be established if the requirements of reliance and substantial similarity are met, but there is also a possibility of exemption under the fair use doctrine. Recently, numerous copyright infringement lawsuits have been filed against AI companies in the United States, drawing attention to this issue. Meanwhile, countries such as the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan have introduced text and data mining (TDM) exemption provisions, allowing the free use of copyrighted works under certain conditions. In South Korea, a proposed amendment to the Copyright Act, which includes the introduction of TDM exemption provisions, has been submitted. The copyright regulation of the AI training process should aim to harmoniously realize the two values of technological innovation and protection of creators."
온라인 기사형 광고에 대한 소비자의 긍정적 반응 : 광고 유형(선 vs 악)과 게재 시점의 상호작용을 중심으로,2024,"['기사형 광고', '텍스트 마이닝', '선한 광고', '악한 광고', '게재 시점', '긍정적 반응', 'Online advertorials', 'Text mining', 'Vice advertorials', 'Virtue advertorials', 'Timing  of posting', 'Positive response']","기사형 광고는 기업이 자사의 신제품 또는 기술적 진보를 시장에 알리기 위해 사용하는 프로모션 수 단 중 하나이다. 광고가 기사의 형태로 제시되면 소비자의 설득지식이 활성화되기 어렵기 때문에 소비 자가 광고의 내용을 신뢰할 가능성이 높아진다. 이런 이유로 기사형 광고는 마케팅 도구로 자주 사용되 고 있으며, 이 광고의 특성과 효과에 대한 연구 역시 활발히 진행되었다. 본 연구는 기사형 광고가 다루 는 제품의 특성에 따라 이를 선(virtue)과 악(vice)으로 분류하여 소비자의 긍정적 반응을 살펴봄과 동 시에 이러한 광고 유형이 게재 시점과 어떻게 상호작용하는지 조사했다. 네이버 포털에 2019년에 게재 된 기사형 광고를 텍스트 마이닝 기법을 사용해 분류한 후, 오전과 오후 시간에 같은 제목으로 게재된 기사형 광고 406개를 선정했다. 소비자가 사용한 긍정적인 이모티콘의 수를 광고가 노출된 시간으로 나눈 값을 긍정적 반응의 지표로 사용했다. 긍정적 반응은 기사형 광고가 게재된 시점이 하루 중 오후 시간일 때 오전 시간일 때에 비해 유의하게 높았다. 광고 유형과 게재 시점의 상호작용은 유의하지 않 았으나, 게재 시점에 따른 효과가 악한 광고의 경우 한계적으로 유의한 반면 선한 광고의 경우 유의하 지 않은 방향성이 나타났다. 이는 악한 광고에서는 게재 시점을 더욱 중요하게 고려해야 함을 의미한다. 일상생활 속의 다양한 방면에 적용할 수 있는 선-악의 구분을 온라인 매체에 적용한 연구는 매우 드문 데, 본 연구는 이를 기사형 광고라는 매체에 적용하여, 기존의 기사형 광고 및 온라인 매체를 다룬 연구 와 구분된다. 또한, 기사형 광고를 추출하고 분류할 때 자주 사용되던 영어 기반의 BERT가 아닌 한글 텍스트 분류에 적합한 KoBERT 모형에 기반한 딥러닝 기법을 사용함으로써 분류에서의 좀 더 높은 정 확도를 획득할 수 있었다. 이와 같은 이론적 시사점과 함께 기사형 광고라는 촉진 도구에 대한 반응이 오후 시간일수록 긍정적이라는 결과는 실무적 시사점을 갖는다. 즉, 자사 제품 홍보를 위해 기사형 광 고를 사용할 때 소비자의 긍정적인 반응을 얻기 위해서는 기사를 오후 시간에 게재하는 것을 제안한다.","The companies often employ advertorial as a promotional tool for promoting their new products or technological advancements to the market. When advertisements are delivered in the form of the news article, it becomes difficult to activate consumers’ persuasion knowledge, thus increasing the likelihood of consumers trusting the content of the advertisement. For this reason, advertorial is frequently used as a promotion tool, and research on its characteristics and effects has been actively conducted. This study classified products featured in advertorial as virtues or vices to examine the positive responses of consumers and investigated how the type of advertisement interacts with the timing of its placement. Advertorials posted on the Naver portal in 2019 were analyzed and classified using text mining techniques, and 406 advertorials published both in the morning and evening were selected considering the impact of the timing of placement on responses. The number of positive emoticons used by consumers was measured as an indicator of positive response, which was significantly higher when the advertorials were posted in the evening compared to the morning. The interaction between advertorials and the timing of placement was not significant, but the effect of timing was marginally significant for vice advertorials, while it was not significant for virtue advertorials. This implies that the timing of placement should be more carefully considered for vice advertorials. Applying the distinction between virtue and vice in various aspects of everyday life to online media is very rare, and this study is distinguished from previous research in that it applies this distinction to advertorials, and online medium. Furthermore, the use of a deep learning technique based on KoBERT, rather than the commonly used English-based BERT, for extracting and classifying advertorials, allowed for higher accuracy in classification. Along with these theoretical implications, the result that responses to advertorials as a promotional tool are more positive later in the day has practical implications. We suggest the firms to implement advertorials for products that are designed for immediate gratification and post them at the evening. Such strategy is expected to enhance the effectiveness of the advertorials."

Along with an understanding of the relationship between Job's trauma and physical experience, the characteristics of Job's traumatic memories, and the mute cry contained in Job's anger, the importance of forming a listening culture in the church community is revealed through the voice that Job demanded from the community during his traumatic suffering.The psychosomatic responses to Job's trauma highlight the importance of understanding the physical responses of people in trauma. This is because in trauma care, if we deal with anger, guilt, and sadness right away without first paying attention to the physical reactions, then the emotions may actually be strengthened. In particular, it reveals that trauma has the characteristic of starting in the body and being followed by the mind.Job's traumatic memories reveal characteristics closer to implicit memory than explicit memory. Implicit memories have the characteristic of being imprinted on the body and emotions. Therefore, it is revealed that traumatic memories can cause symptoms such as body tremors and paralysis. Furthermore, it suggests that while trauma may be amplified when talking about traumatic memories, there are also characteristics that are mitigated when testifying about traumatic experiences. For this purpose, we propose a deconstruction response method, where people testify and experience it again in order to eliminate the emotional excess from the experience of pain. This technique reveals that it may serve to positively update traumatic memories that were originally overwhelming and led to failures in self-protection.It is emphasized that when the church community listens to the testimony of a person experiencing trauma, it is a journey of sharing their pain and learning how to cry with them. This study highlights the importance of listening to the grief and anger of people suffering from trauma. In particular, through analysis of the anger emotional system and characteristics of people suffering from trauma, we reveal the characteristics of mute crying that lie behind anger and deep emotions. It reveals that the anger of a person experiencing trauma not only contains emotions such as protest, conflict, agony, doubt, hurt, anxiety, and acceptance, but also that these emotional registers are connected to each other. The church community emphasizes that when it listens to the stories and testimonies of people who are experiencing trauma, and even hears their mute cry, they too can experience post-traumatic growth like Job."
김승옥 소설의 분열적 인간성 -죽음충동을 중심으로-,2024,"['Lacan', 'The real', 'death impulse', 'divisiveness', 'Hegel', 'love', 'evil', '라캉', '실재계', '죽음충동', '분열성', '헤겔', '사랑', '악']","본고는 김승옥 소설에 드러난 인간의 본질을 ‘분열성’으로 정의하고 탐구를 시도하였다. 특히 라캉 정신분석학의 ‘죽음충동’이라는 개념에 착안하여 죽음충동을 매개로 분열하고 있는 인간의 순수성을 ‘자기세계’의 개념으로 도출하였다. 김승옥의 ‘자기세계’는 수많은 연구의 대상이 되어왔으나 그 애매모호한 성격, ‘악’의 냄새와 광기의 몸짓이 새로운 감수성의 색채로 덧칠되어 있는 탓에 명확하게 의미화되지 못했다. 본고는 이 연구사의 교착상태를 풀어낼 해결책으로 라캉 정신분석학의 ‘실재계’, 그 중에서도 ‘충동’의 ‘생명성’을 제출하는 바이다. 시대를 외면하고 개인주의에만 함몰되어 있다는 일각의 시선과는 다르게, 본고는 그가 1960년대의 시대성을 충실히 구현해내고 있음과 더불어 1960년대를 넘어 현시대에도 여전히 진리를 전달할 사도의 역할을 할 수 있음을 제시해보이고자 한다. 그는 무기력한 전후문학에 생명의 고동을 부여하고자 했던 혁명적인 소설가이기 때문이다.이를 위해 먼저 2절에서는 각 작품에 드러난 죽음충동의 양상들을 추적해보았다. 김승옥적 주체들은 ‘극기’를 통해 상징계라는 하나의 세계를 형성하면서 ‘지나치게 많은 생명’으로서의 순수한 악, 죽음충동의 행위를 저항적으로 분출한다. 이러한 생명의 충동은 상징계적 주체들에게 증상으로서, 동물과 여성의 형상으로서 무두적으로 지속된다. 상징계의 ‘힘’의 논리, 폭력성과 거짓, 속물성을 혐오하고 귀여운 토끼와 새끼염소를 사랑하면서도, 주체는 분열의 진공 상태에 스스로 몸을 담근다. 성장한다는 것, 타자들의 세계, 서울에서 살아갈 수밖에 없음을 씁쓸하게 인정하며 지옥 같은 타인들의 틈에 들어서지 않을 수 없는 인간 실존의 본성을 지적한다. 이것은 속물성에 대한 어쩔 수 없다는 긍정이 아니라 타자들의 세계로 진입하지 않을 수 없는 인간의 존재론적 성질에 관한 김승옥의 통찰이다.3절에서는 이러한 이율배반적 위치에 관한 인간의 분열성을 집중적으로 살펴보려고 시도하였다. 김승옥은 분열성의 간극, 사이의 공간에서 발생하는 죽음충동의 생명과 자유, 사랑, 혁명을 형상화한다. 죽음충동의 생명성을 보유하면서도 생존해야 한다는 인간적 ‘본능’을 가진 주체들의 양상은 선과 악이라는 상징계적 도덕을 넘어선 여성 인물들에게 적극적으로 투영되고 있다. 여기서 도덕과 윤리의 구분은 중요하다. 도덕을 넘어서는 윤리는 오히려 타인들에 대한 도덕을 깊게 체화한 주체에게서나 기대될 수 있는 것이기 때문이다. 즉 타인에게 피해와 상처를 주지 않으려는 상징계적 도덕은 그로 인한 나르시시즘적 이익, 대타자에게 선하게 보임으로써 획득되는 사회적, 정념적 이해관계에서 자유롭지 못하다. 이러한 방식으로 상징계적 상블랑을 학습한 인물들은 오히려 위선적, 이데올로기적이다. 그러나 타인에 대한 예의, 배려, 도덕을 깊은 ‘사랑’이라는 윤리적 자세로 수용한 인물들은 도덕과 윤리가 상충하는 순간 윤리를 지향하는 위악의 행위를 도맡는다. 라캉에게 윤리가 실재계에 속한다는 점을 주지할 때 김승옥의 생명은 바로 이 위악성으로, 부자유하게 평온한 양옥집을 부수는 ‘악마’로 출력되고 있음을 알 수 있다. 인간의 분열성은 실재계로의, 진정한 윤리로의 지향성으로 열리는 자유의 상처인 것이다.4절에서는 김승옥이 남성과 여성의 라캉적 성...","This paper defined the human nature revealed in Kim Seung-ok’s novel as ‘divisionality’ and attempted to explore. In particular, based on the concept of ‘death impulse’ in Lacan psychoanalysis, the purity of human beings divided through death impulse was derived as the concept of ‘self-world‘. Kim Seung-ok’s ‘self-world’ has been the subject of numerous studies, but its ambiguous character, smell of ‘evil’, and gestures of madness were painted over with new sensitivity. This paper presents the ‘real world’ of Lacan psychoanalysis, especially the ‘life’ of ‘impulse’, as a solution to solve the deadlock of this research. Contrary to the view of some that he is ignoring the times and is only immersed in individualism, this paper aims to suggest that he is faithfully embodying the times of the 1960s and that he can still play the role of an apostle who will convey the truth in the present era beyond the 1960s. This is because he is a revolutionary novelist who tried to give life a beating to helpless postwar literature.To this end, in Section 2, the aspects of death impulse revealed in each work were first traced. Kim Seung-ok’s subjects form a world called the symbolic world through ‘the extreme’ and resistively erupt the pure evil and death impulse as ‘excessive life’. These impulses of life persist in the form of animals and women as a symptom to the symbolic subjects. While abhorring the logic, violence and lies, snobbery of the symbolic world, and loving the cute rabbit and baby goat, the subject immerses himself in a vacuum of division. He bitterly acknowledges that he has no choice but to grow up, the world of others, and points out the nature of human existence that is forced to enter the gap of others like hell. This is not an affirmation that he cannot help but enter the world of snobbery, but Kim Seung-ok’s insight into the ontological nature of humans who are forced to enter the world of others.Section 3 attempted to intensively examine the division of human beings regarding this antinomic position. Kim Seung-ok embodies the life, freedom, love, and revolution of the death impulse that occurs in the space between the gaps of division. The aspects of subjects with the human ‘instinct’ that they must survive while retaining the vitality of the death impulse are actively projected to female characters beyond the symbolic morality of good and evil. Here, the distinction between morality and ethics is important. This is because ethics beyond morality can only be expected from subjects who deeply embody morality toward others. In other words, symbolic morality that does not damage or hurt others is not free from the narcissistic interests and social and passionate interests obtained by being good to others. The characters who have learned the symbolic Sangblanc in this way are rather hypocritical and ideological. However, characters who accept courtesy, consideration, and morality toward others with an ethical attitude of deep ‘love’ are in charge of evil actions aimed at ethics at the moment when morality and ethics conflict. When Lacan is aware that ethics belongs to the real world, it can be seen that Kim Seung-ok’s life is printed as a ‘devil’ who breaks down the unnaturally calm Yangok House. Human division is a wound of freedom that opens up with a direction toward the real world and true ethics.In Section 4, we focused on the part where Kim Seung-ok attempted Hegelian reconciliation by seeing the Lacan gender difference between men and women as a matter of ‘enemy’. This is also referred to as a Buddhist spirit through a conversation with Ha In-sook in “Mujin Travel”. This is because humans who dream of a kingdom that is absent like a Kantian object itself and a mirage but cannot be given up are a ‘life’ that is subordinate to the ‘date’ beyond the gender difference between women and men. This vitality triggers the impulse of love b..."
YOLOv4를 이용한 CCTV 영상 내 군중 밀집도 분석 서비스 개발,2024,"['CCTV', 'Crowd Density', 'Deep Leaning', 'Object Detection', 'YOLOv4']","본 논문에서는 2022년 10월 29일 한국에서 발생한 이태원 압사 사고를 기반으로 미래에 발생할 수 있는 인파 사고에 대하여 군중 밀집으로 인한 위험을 미리 예측하고, 예방하기 위한 목적으로 작성되었다. 단일 CCTV 같은 경우 관리자가 실시간으로 현재 상황을 판별할 수 있지만, 하루 종일 해당 화면만 들여다볼 수 없기 때문에 CCTV 화각으로 촬영된 영상들을 학습한 YOLO v4를 이용하여 객체를 탐지하고, 정해진 군집의 수가 초과하는 순간에 알림을 통해 군중 밀집으로 인한 안전사고를 예방하게 된다. YOLO v4 모델을 사용하게 된 이유는 이전 YOLO 모델보다 더욱 높은 정확성과 빠른 속도로 개선되어, 객체 탐지 기법이 더 용이해졌기 때문이다. 본 서비스를 AI-Hub 사이트에 등재된 CCTV 영상 데이터로 테스트하는 과정을 거치게 된다. 현재 한국에 CCTV는 기하급수적으로 증가하였고, 이를 실제 CCTV에 적용한다면 앞으로 일어나게 될 군중 밀집으로 인한 사고를 비롯한 다양한 사고를 예방할 수 있을 것으로 기대한다.","In this paper, the purpose of this paper is to predict and prevent the risk of crowd concentration in advance for possible future crowd accidents based on the Itaewon crush accident in Korea on October 29, 2022. In the case of a single CCTV, the administrator can determine the current situation in real time, but since the screen cannot be seen throughout the day, objects are detected using YOLOv4, which learns images taken with CCTV angle, and safety accidents due to crowd concentration are prevented by notification when the number of clusters exceeds. The reason for using the YOLO v4 model is that it improves with higher accuracy and faster speed than the previous YOLO model, making object detection techniques easier. This service will go through the process of testing with CCTV image data registered on the AI-Hub site. Currently, CCTVs have increased exponentially in Korea, and if they are applied to actual CCTVs, it is expected that various accidents, including accidents caused by crowd concentration in the future, can be prevented."
