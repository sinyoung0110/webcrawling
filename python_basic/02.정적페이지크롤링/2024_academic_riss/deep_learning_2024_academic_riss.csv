"Accurate, automated classification of radiographic knee osteoarthritis severity using a novel method of deep learning: Plug-in modules",2024,"['Knee osteoarthritis', 'Deep learning', 'Classification']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background Fine-grained classification deals with data with a large degree of similarity, such as cat or bird species, and similarly, knee osteoarthritis severity classification [Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading] is one such fine-grained classification task. Recently, a plug-in module (PIM) that can be integrated into convolutional neural-network-based or transformer-based networks has been shown to provide strong discriminative regions for fine-grained classification, with results that outperformed the previous deep learning models. PIM utilizes each pixel of an image as an independent feature and can subsequently better classify images with minor differences. It was hypothesized that, as a fine-grained classification task, knee osteoarthritis severity may be classified well using PIMs. The aim of the study was to develop this automated knee osteoarthritis classification model.Methods A deep learning model that classifies knee osteoarthritis severity of a radiograph was developed utilizing PIMs. A retrospective analysis on prospectively collected data was performed. The model was trained and developed using the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset and was subsequently tested on an independent dataset, the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (test set size: 17,040). The final deep learning model was designed through an ensemble of four different PIMs.Results The accuracy of the model was 84%, 43%, 70%, 81%, and 96% for KL grade 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, with an overall accuracy of 75.7%.Conclusions The ensemble of PIMs could classify knee osteoarthritis severity using simple radiographs with a fine accuracy. Although improvements will be needed in the future, the model has been proven to have the potential to be clinically useful."

This study evaluates an advanced deep learning (DL) model, building upon a precursor, for its proficiency in generating uniform and precise alignment measurements in full-leg radiographs irrespective of institutional imaging differences.Methods The enhanced DL model was trained on over 10,000 radiographs. Utilizing a segmented approach, it separately identified and evaluated regions of interest (ROIs) for the hip, knee, and ankle, subsequently integrating these regions. For external validation, 300 datasets from three distinct institutes with varied imaging protocols and equipment were employed. The study measured seven radiologic parameters: hip-knee-ankle angle, lateral distal femoral angle, medial proximal tibial angle, joint line convergence angle, weight-bearing line ratio, joint line obliquity angle, and lateral distal tibial angle. Measurements by the model were compared with an orthopedic specialist’s evaluations using inter-observer and intra-observer intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Additionally, the absolute error percentage in alignment measurements was assessed, and the processing duration for radiograph evaluation was recorded.Results The DL model exhibited excellent performance, achieving an inter-observer ICC between 0.936 and 0.997, on par with an orthopedic specialist, and an intra-observer ICC of 1.000. The model’s consistency was robust across different institutional imaging protocols. Its accuracy was particularly notable in measuring the hip-knee-ankle angle, with no instances of absolute error exceeding 1.5 degrees. The enhanced model significantly improved processing speed, reducing the time by 30-fold from an initial 10–11 s to 300 ms.Conclusions The enhanced DL model demonstrated its ability for accurate, rapid alignment measurements in fullleg radiographs, regardless of protocol variations, signifying its potential for broad clinical and research applicability."
Hybrid Deep Learning for Facial Emotion Recognition: Prioritizing Emotionally Relevant Regions with Selective Attention,2024,"['facial emotion recognition', 'deep learning', 'selective attention', 'CNN', 'hybrid model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The proposed framework is a hybrid deep learning model aimed at enhancing the detection of Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) by focusing on specific facial areas that are particularly expressive of emotions. Classical FER methods rarely deal with the subtle emotional signals due to their disregard for these key areas. The framework combines selective attention mechanisms with Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks, with the aim of enhancing detection and retention of emotion-relevant features. Initial experiments indicate that concentrating on the areas really improves detection accuracy in comparison to classic CNN models and does quite well even under variable light conditions and orientations."

A deep learning based automatic two-dimensional digital templating model for total knee arthroplasty,2024,"['Total knee arthroplasty', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Preoperative templating', 'Implant size prediction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background Preoperative templating is an important step for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), facilitating hospital personnel in the anticipation and preparation of necessary surgical resources. Despite its importance, this process currently lacks automation. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to automate implant size prediction.Methods A total of 13,281 (2938 anteroposterior, 10,343 lateral) knee radiographs obtained from the authors’ institute were utilized for model training, with 2302 (1034 anteroposterior, 1268 lateral) images set apart for validation and testing. The templating AI model integrates a pipeline composed of multiple steps for automated implant size estimation. To predict implant size, anterioposterior (AP) and lateral radiograph predictions were merged, selecting the smaller of the predicted sizes to prevent implant overhang. The model’s size predictions were validated with 81 real TKA data set apart from the training data, and its accuracy was compared to that of manual templating by an orthopedic specialist. Predictions matching the actual implanted sizes were labeled “exact” and those within one size, “accurate.” The influence of patient characteristics on the model’s prediction accuracy was also analyzed. The measurement time elapsed for implant sizing was recorded for both the AI model and the orthopedic specialist. Implant position predicted by the model was validated by comparing insert locations with postoperative images.Results Compared with data from 81 actual TKA procedures, the model provided exact predictions for 39.5% of femoral and 43.2% of tibial components. Allowing a one-size margin of error, 88.9% of predictions were deemed “accurate” for both components. Interobserver reliability (Cohen’s kappa) were 0.60 and 0.70 for femoral and tibial implants, respectively, both classified as “substantial.” The orthopedic specialist produced results accurate within one-size margin of error in 95.1% and 100% of cases for femoral and tibial components, respectively. Interobserver reliability between the orthopedic specialist and ground truth was 0.76 and 0.8 for femoral and tibial components, respectively. The measurement time per case was 48.7 s for the AI model, compared with 97.5 s for the orthopedic specialist. Compared with postoperative radiographs, predicted implant position had an error of less than 4 mm on average.Conclusions An AI-based templating tool for TKA was successfully developed, demonstrating satisfactory accuracy and efficiency. Its application could significantly reduce the clinical workload in TKA preparation."

This study compared the measurements performed by BoneMetrics (Gleamer, Paris, France), a commercial artificial intelligence (AI)-based software, to expert manual measurements on anteroposterior full-leg standing radiographs.Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on a dataset comprising consecutive anteroposterior full-leg standing radiographs obtained from four imaging institutions. Key anatomical landmarks to define the hip-knee- ankle angle, pelvic obliquity, leg length, femoral length, and tibial length were annotated independently by two expert musculoskeletal radiologists and served as the ground truth.

Mean absolute error values were 0.30° (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.28, 0.32]) for the hip-knee-ankle angle, 0.75 mm (95% CI [0.60, 0.88]) for pelvic obliquity, 1.03 mm (95% CI [0.91,1.14]) for leg length from the top of the femoral head, 1.45 mm (95% CI [1.33, 1.60]) for leg length from the center of the femoral head, 0.95 mm (95% CI [0.85, 1.04]) for femoral length from the top of the femoral head, 1.23 mm (95% CI [1.12, 1.32]) for femoral length from the center of the femoral head, and 1.38 mm (95% CI [1.21, 1.52]) for tibial length. The Bland-Altman analyses revealed no systematic bias across all measurements. Additionally, the software exhibited excellent agreement with the gold-standard measurements with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values above 0.97 for all parameters.Conclusions Automated measurements on anteroposterior full-leg standing radiographs offer a reliable alternative to manual assessments. The use of AI in musculoskeletal radiology has the potential to support physicians in their daily practice without compromising patient care standards."

Crop Leaf Disease Identification Using Deep Transfer Learning,2024,"['Agricultural Artificial Intelligence', 'Crop Leaf Disease Identification', 'Plant Protection', 'Transfer Learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Traditional manual identification of crop leaf diseases is challenging. Owing to the limitations in manpower and resources, it is challenging to explore crop diseases on a large scale. The emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly the extensive application of deep learning technologies, is expected to overcome these challenges and greatly improve the accuracy and efficiency of crop disease identification. Crop leaf disease identification models have been designed and trained using large-scale training data, enabling them to predict different categories of diseases from unlabeled crop leaves. However, these models, which possess strong feature representation capabilities, require substantial training data, and there is often a shortage of such datasets in practical farming scenarios. To address this issue and improve the feature learning abilities of models, this study proposes a deep transfer learning adaptation strategy. The novel proposed method aims to transfer the weights and parameters from pre-trained models in similar large-scale training datasets, such as ImageNet. ImageNet pre-trained weights are adopted and fine-tuned with the features of crop leaf diseases to improve prediction ability. In this study, we collected 16,060 crop leaf disease images, spanning 12 categories, for training. The experimental results demonstrate that an impressive accuracy of 98% is achieved using the proposed method on the transferred ResNet-50 model, thereby confirming the effectiveness of our transfer learning approach."

Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) add uncertainty to energy demand that can be dealt with flexible operation (e.g., load-following) of CPES; at the same time, scenarios that could result in severe consequences due to both component stochastic failures and aging of the cyber system of CPES (commonly overlooked) must be accounted for Operation & Maintenance (O&M) planning. In this paper, we make use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to search for the optimal O&M strategy that, not only considers the actual system hardware components health conditions and their Remaining Useful Life (RUL), but also the possible accident scenarios caused by the failures and the aging of the hardware and the cyber components, respectively.

Existing research has shown that the combination of deep learning and communication technology is expected to break some performance bottlenecks of traditional communication algorithms and solutions. This paper explores the application of deep learning (DL) in polar decoding algorithms, proposing a DL-Aided-FSC (DL-FSC) polar code decoder algorithm. For the DL-FSC decoding algorithm, The conventional successive cancellation (SC) decoder is partitioned into multiple sub-blocks, which are replaced by R0 nodes, R1 nodes and sub-DL decoder.The LLR and frozen bit pattern are input to the sub-DL decoder to predict decode codewords under any decoding code rate.

The study was conducted using phantoms and patients, and CT images were obtained while adjusting the intensity of DLIR to low (DLIR-L), middle (DLIR-M), and high (DLIR-H). To quantitatively evaluate image quality, the coefficient of variation (COV) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), as well as natural image quality evaluation (NIQE) and blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE), were used. In both the noise level and blind quality evaluation results, a higher strength of DLIR resulted in better results derived from the phantom and patient studies. In particular, the results of the phantom study confirmed that NIQE and BRISQUE of CT images acquired using DLIR-H were improved by approximately 5 % and 1 %, respectively, compared to the corresponding the application of DLIR-L. Moreover, when high-strength deep-learning was applied to a real patients CT image reconstruction method, the NIQE and BRISQUE results improved by approximately 6 % and 4 %, respectively, compared with their respective medium levels. In conclusion, we quantitatively analyzed the image quality according to the intensity of the recently developed deep-learning-based CT image reconstruction method."

This condition leads to a deterioration in bone mineral density and microarchitecture, significantly increasing the risk of fractures. Additionally, osteoporosis commonly results in complications such as screw loosening and non-union during spinal surgery. Deep-learning algorithms have now achieved an accuracy comparable to the current human margin of error. Therefore, this study explored the potential of using transfer learning in deep learning algorithms to predict, diagnose, and screen for osteoporosis using commonly obtained sagittal spine X-rays from patients with spinal conditions.Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 2,300 consecutive patients who underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and lumbar sagittal plain X-ray exams between 2013 and 2021. The exclusion criteria included: (1) a gap of more than 1 year between the DXA and X-ray exams; (2) vertebrae that had undergone vertebroplasty; (3) lack of spine anterior-posterior DXA; and (4) images that were unassessable. Ultimately, 256 patients (images) were included in the study. Transfer learning was applied using convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques, specifically visual geometry group (VGG) 16, VGG 19, ResNet50, and Xception.Results: The most accurate CNN model in the training group was ResNet50, with an accuracy of 0.95. ResNet50 showed the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.82, precision of 0.80, recall of 0.86, and F1-score of 0.83. Additionally, its area under the curve (0.76) was higher than that other CNN models. The confusion matrix for ResNet50’s performance displayed the outcomes for images predicted as osteoporosis (n=12) among the test data osteoporosis images (n=14)Conclusion: Artificial intelligence (AI) technology employing deep learning techniques is significantly nearing human capabilities in the role of diagnostic assistance. The diagnosis of osteoporosis using bone mineral density is expected to evolve into a comprehensive diagnostic aid or decision-making tool with the integration of AI in the future."

In particular, AI pilots through reinforcement learning (RL) are more flexible than those using rule-based methods. Further, AI pilots with RL are expected to replace human pilots in the future. In a recent study, rather than completely replacing humans, studies on AI pilots are conducted toward the collaboration between man and unmanned aircraft. AI pilots have several advantages over humans. For example, on the one hand, human pilots avoid head-on situations due to collision. On the other hand, AI pilots may prefer head-on situations to finish the episode quickly. This study proposes a two-circle-based transfer learning method to demonstrate excellent performance in head-on situations.

Deep Learning-based UHF RFID Tag Collision Detection Method,2024,"['Deep learning', 'UHF', 'RFID', 'Tag']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper presents a novel deep learning-based radio frequency identification (RFID) tag collision detection method for ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID. UHF RFID technology provides longer communication range compared to NFC, barcode, and QR code technology. However, due to the longer range, multiple tags in wide range may reply simultaneously such that a reader receives superposed signal of multiple tags. Multiple tag signals interfere with each other such that reader’s tag reading speed is decreased. In order to detect these tag collisions, previous studies utilized analytical methods rather than theoretical ones. Hence, a deep learning-based solution can improve the detection performance. For deep learning, training datasets are generated from mathematical equations, which are specified by the standard, with various delay times, amplitude differences, phase differences and noise level among tag signals.Arbitrary delay time, phase difference, and amplitude difference are used in every run of simulation.Simulation results show that the detection performance using the proposed method is about 5 dB better than that of existing method."

In toxicopathology, research is actively underway to analyze whole slide image (WSI)-level images using AI deep-learning models. However, few studies have been conducted on models for diagnosing complex lesions comprising multiple lesions. Therefore, this study used deep learning segmentation models (YOLOv8, Mask R-CNN, and SOLOv2) to identify three representative lesions (tubular basophilia with atrophy, mononuclear cell infiltration, and hyaline casts) of chronic progressive nephropathy of the kidney, a complex lesion observed in a non-clinical test using rats and selected an initial model appropriate for diagnosing complex lesions by analyzing the characteristics of each algorithm. Approximately 2000 images containing three lesions were extracted using 33 WSI of rat kidneys with chronic progressive nephropathy.Among them, 1701 images were divided into first and second rounds of learning. The loss and mAP50 values were measured twice to confirm the performances of the three algorithms. Loss measurements were stopped at an appropriate epoch to prevent overfitting, and the loss value decreased in the second round based on the data learned in the first round. After measuring the accuracy twice, detection using Mask R-CNN showed the highest mAP50 in all lesions among the three models and was considered sufficient as an initial model for diagnosing complex lesions. By contrast, the YOLOv8 and SOLOv2 models showed low accuracy for all three lesions and had difficulty with segmentation tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes a Mask R-CNN as the initial model for segmenting complex lesions. Precise diagnosis is possible if the model can be trained by increasing the input data, thereby providing greater accuracy in diagnosing pathological images."
Improving the quality of light-field data extracted from a hologram using deep learning,2024,"['deep learning', 'generative adversarial network', 'holography', 'light field', 'speckle noise']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We propose a method to suppress the speckle noise and blur effects of the light field extracted from a hologram using a deep-learning technique. The light field can be extracted by bandpass filtering in the hologram's frequency domain. The extracted light field has reduced spatial resolution owing to the limited passband size of the bandpass filter and the blurring that occurs when the object is far from the hologram plane and also contains speckle noise caused by the random phase distribution of the three-dimensional object surface. These limitations degrade the reconstruction quality of the hologram resynthesized using the extracted light field. In the proposed method, a deep-learning model based on a generative adversarial network is designed to suppress speckle noise and blurring, resulting in improved quality of the light field extracted from the hologram. The model is trained using pairs of original two-dimensional images and their corresponding light-field data extracted from the complex field generated by the images. Validation of the proposed method is performed using light-field data extracted from holograms of objects with single and multiple depths and mesh-based computer-generated holograms."

For the three-dimensional (3D) assessment of the TMJ, segmentation of the mandibular condyle and articular fossa is essential. This study aimed to perform deep learning-based 3D segmentation of the mandibular condyle on CBCT images and evaluate the performance of the segmentation.Methods: CBCT scan data from 99 patients (mean age: 53.3±19.2 years) diagnosed with TMJ disorders were analyzed. From the CBCT images, sagittal, coronal, and axial planes showing the mandibular condyle were selected and combined to form two-dimensional (2D) images. The U-Net deep learning model was used to exclusively segment the mandibular condyle area from the 2D images. From these results, 3D images of the mandibular condyle were reconstructed. Accuracy, precision, recall, and the Dice coefficient were calculated to appraise segmentation performance in each plane.Results: The average Dice coefficient was 0.92 for the coronal and axial planes and 0.82 for the sagittal plane. The CBCT image-based segmentation performance of the mandibular condyle in the coronal and axial planes exceeded that in the sagittal plane. The sharpness and uniformity of the 2D images affected segmentation performance, with segmentation errors more likely occurring in non-uniform images. Certain segmentation errors were corrected through software processing. Finally, the segmented mandibular condyle images were applied to the CBCT data to reconstruct a 3D TMJ model.Conclusions: Mandibular condyle 3D segmentation on CBCT images using U-Net may help evaluate and diagnose TMJ disorders. The proposed segmentation method may assist clinicians in efficiently analyzing CBCT images, particularly in cases involving anatomical abnormalities."

Despite this, GEMS relies solely on the ultraviolet and partial visible bands,lacking the infrared bands crucial for snow detection, and it has no proprietary snowdetection algorithm, instead utilizing near-real-time ice and snow extent data fromthe U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. Recently, deep learning techniques haveshown potential in image processing, outperforming traditional algorithms, whichcould address these limitations. However, there is currently no deep learning trainingdataset available for snow detection specifically for GEMS. To address this issue, thisstudy developed a GeoAI dataset for training a deep learning-based snow detectionmodel for GEMS. In this research, we constructed input data using GEMS Level 1Cdata and generated label data based on GEMS, Advanced Meteorological Imager,and MODIS snow cover data. The snow detection dataset developed in this study isexpected to address the snow detection limitations of GEMS, providing foundationaldata to enhance the reliability of future geostationary satellite-based air qualityresearch."
Clinical validity and precision of deep learning-based cone-beam computed tomography automatic landmarking algorithm,2024,"['Cone-Beam Computed Tomography', 'Anatomic Landmarks', 'Cephalometry', 'Deep Learning', 'Orthognathic Surgery']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: This study was performed to assess the clinical validity and accuracy of a deep learning-based automatic landmarking algorithm for cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Three-dimensional (3D) CBCT head measurements obtained through manual and automatic landmarking were compared.Materials and Methods: A total of 80 CBCT scans were divided into 3 groups: non-surgical (39 cases); surgical without hardware, namely surgical plates and mini-screws (9 cases); and surgical with hardware (32 cases). Each CBCT scan was analyzed to obtain 53 measurements, comprising 27 lengths, 21 angles, and 5 ratios, which were determined based on 65 landmarks identified using either a manual or a 3D automatic landmark detection method. Results: In comparing measurement values derived from manual and artificial intelligence landmarking, 6 items displayed significant differences: R U6CP-L U6CP, R L3CP-L L3CP, S-N, Or_R-R U3CP, L1L to Me-GoL, and GoR-Gn/S-N (P<0.05). Of the 3 groups, the surgical scans without hardware exhibited the lowest error, reflecting the smallest difference in measurements between human- and artificial intelligence-based landmarking. The time required to identify 65 landmarks was approximately 40-60 minutes per CBCT volume when done manually, compared to 10.9 seconds for the artificial intelligence method (PC specifications: GeForce 2080Ti, 64GB RAM, and an Intel i7 CPU at 3.6 GHz).Conclusion: Measurements obtained with a deep learning-based CBCT automatic landmarking algorithm were similar in accuracy to values derived from manually determined points. By decreasing the time required to calculate these measurements, the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment may be improved."
Benchmark study on a novel online dataset for standard evaluation of deep learning-based pavement cracks classification models,2024,"['Convolutional neural networks', 'Pavement cracks', 'Deep learning', 'Benchmark study', 'Crack classification']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Highway agencies and practitioners expect to have the most efficient method with adequate accuracy when choosing a deep learning-based model for pavement crack classification. However, many works are implemented on their own dataset, making them hard to compare with each other, and also less persuasive and robust. Therefore, a Road Cracks Classification Dataset is proposed to serve as a standard and open-source dataset. Based on this dataset, a benchmark study of fourteen deep learning classification methods is evaluated. Two parameters, the Ratio of F1 and Training Time (RFT) and Ratio of F1 and Prediction Time (RFP), are proposed to quantify the efficiency of networks. The results show that ConvNeXt_base reaches the highest accuracy among all models but requires the longest training time. AlexNet takes the least training time among all models, but gains the lowest accuracy. Of the four crack types, the block crack has the lowest accuracy, which means it is the most difficult to detect. SqueezeNet1_0 has the highest efficiency among all models in converting the computing power to accuracy. Wide ResNet 50_2 consumes the longest prediction time among CNN models, while the ConvNeXt_base has the highest feasibility on real-time tasks. To implement a suitable deep learning-based pavement crack inspection, we recommend a good balance between computational cost and accuracy. Based on this, we provide practical recommendations according to different user groups."

They play a crucial role in helping audiences decide whether or not to watch a film, as they provide information about the plot, mood, scale, characters, and more. However, despite their importance, the impact of movie trailers on box office performance has not been systematically studied. To bridge the gap in the literature, this paper employs deep learning algorithms to extract visual, auditory, and dialogue features from movie trailers. Using these features, we analyze the impact of movie trailers on box office performance through a multi-modal approach utilizing deep learning-based models. Analyzing 296 movies released in South Korea from 2017 to 2023 revealed that the most accurate prediction of a movie’s box office success was achieved by considering the collective impact of different features of a trailer, rather than considering each feature separately. We also found that our model most accurately predicted the cumulative number of movie’ viewers up to the seven days after a movie’s release. Finally, the results showed that the genre of the movie did not significantly impact the effectiveness of movie trailers in predicting the box office performance. We believe that the present study makes a contribution to the field as it comprehensively analyzed the impact of movie trailers on the box office performance from a multifaceted perspective using a variety of deep learning algorithms."

The ultimate goal of this article is to provide a big data analysis of 330 reviews of the movie Noryang and to evaluate the Naive Bayes model, the Random Forests model, the DNN model, and the LSTM model in machine learning and deep learning. A point to note is that the name Yi, Sun-shin was the most widely used by viewers, followed by the word movie, and the word general, in that order. A major point of this article is that the name Yi, Sun-shin and the word movie showed up twice as the first keyword. This in turn implies that these keywords are the most noteworthy ones. The sentiment analysis argues that about 75% of viewers think of the film as well-made and that they were highly satisfied with it. In this paper, we used the Naive Bayes model, the Random Forests model, the DNN model, and the LSTM model and made them predict whether each review is positive or negative. The Random Forests model works well for our data, whereas the Naive Bayes model does not. When learning took place 25 times, the DNN model worked well for our data (its accuracy rate is 82.76%). When it comes to the LSTM model, its accuracy did not improve even though learning took place 9 times. Yet, the LSTM model is slightly better than the DNN model with respect to the accuracy rate of test data."

Four scans at four different radiation dose levels were performed using a 256-slice CT (Revolution Apex CT, GE Healthcare). Each scan was reconstructed using three different reconstruction algorithms: adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-V at a level of 50% (AR50), Truefidelity (TF), which is a DLIR method, and TF with a lung enhancement filter (TF + Lu). Thus, 12 sets of reconstructed images were obtained and analyzed. Image noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio were compared among the three reconstruction algorithms. Nodule sharpness was compared among the three reconstruction algorithms using the full-width at half-maximum value. Furthermore, subjective image quality analysis was performed.Results: AR50 demonstrated the highest level of noise, which was decreased by using TF + Lu and TF alone (P = 0.001). TF + Lu significantly improved nodule sharpness at all radiation doses compared to TF alone (P = 0.001). The nodule sharpness of TF + Lu was similar to that of AR50. Using TF alone resulted in the lowest nodule sharpness.Conclusion: Adding a lung enhancement filter to DLIR (TF + Lu) significantly improved the nodule sharpness compared to DLIR alone (TF).

At the vessel-level, there were close correlations between model-derived vs. experts-measured IVUS parameters; minimal lumen image area (r=0.92), EEM area (r=0.88), lumen volume (r=0.99) and plaque volume (r=0.95). The agreement between model-derived vs. expert-measured minimal lumen area was similarly excellent compared to the experts' agreement. The model-based lumen and EEM segmentation for a 20-mm lesion segment required 13.2 seconds, whereas manual segmentation with a 0.2-mm interval by an expert took 187.5 minutes on average.Conclusions: The deep learning models can accurately and quickly delineate vascular geometry. The artificial intelligence-based methodology may support clinicians’ decision-making by real-time application in the catheterization laboratory."

"A Novel, Deep Learning-Based, Automatic Photometric Analysis Software for Breast Aesthetic Scoring",2024,"['breast cancer', 'aesthetics', 'deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background Breast aesthetics evaluation often relies on subjective assessments, leading to the need for objective, automated tools. We developed the Seoul Breast Esthetic Scoring Tool (S-BEST), a photometric analysis software that utilizes a DenseNet-264 deep learning model to automatically evaluate breast landmarks and asymmetry indices. Methods S-BEST was trained on a dataset of frontal breast photographs annotated with 30 specific landmarks, divided into an 80-20 training-validation split. The software requires the distances of sternal notch to nipple or nipple-to-nipple as input and performs image preprocessing steps, including ratio correction and 8-bit normalization. Breast asymmetry indices and centimeter-based measurements are provided as the output. The accuracy of S-BEST was validated using a paired t-test and Bland-Altman plots, comparing its measurements to those obtained from physical examinations of 100 females diagnosed with breast cancer. Results S-BEST demonstrated high accuracy in automatic landmark localization, with most distances showing no statistically significant difference compared with physical measurements. However, the nipple to inframammary fold distance showed a significant bias, with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.3787 to 0.4234 for the left and right sides, respectively. Conclusion S-BEST provides a fast, reliable, and automated approach for breast aesthetic evaluation based on 2D frontal photographs. While limited by its inability to capture volumetric attributes or multiple viewpoints, it serves as an accessible tool for both clinical and research applications."
Application of Deep Learning-Based   Object Detection Models to Classify Images of   Cacatua Parrot Species,2024,"['Cacatua parrots', 'CITES', 'conservation', 'deep learning', 'image classification', 'object detection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Parrots, especially the Cacatua species, are a particular focus for trade because of their mimicry, plumage, and intelligence. Indeed, Cacatua species are imported most into Korea. To manage trade in wildlife, it is essential to identify the traded species. This is conventionally achieved by morphological identification by experts, but the increasing volume of trade is overwhelming them. Identification of parrots, particularly Cacatua species, is difficult due to their similar features, leading to frequent misidentification. There is thus a need for tools to assist experts in accurately identifying Cacatua species in situ. Deep learning-based object detection models, such as the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series, have been successfully employed to classify wildlife and can help experts by reducing their workloads. Among these models, YOLO versions 5 and 8 have been widely applied for wildlife classification.The later model normally performs better, but selecting and designing a suitable model remains crucial for custom datasets, such as wildlife. Here, YOLO versions 5 and 8 were employed to classify 13 Cacatua species in the image data. Images of these species were collected from eBird, iNaturalist, and Google. The dataset was divided, with 80% used for training and validation and 20% for evaluating model performance. Model performance was measured by mean average precision, with YOLOv5 achieving 0.889 and YOLOv8 achieving 0.919. YOLOv8 was thus better than YOLOv5 at detecting and classifying Cacatua species in the examined images. The model developed here could significantly support the management of the global trade in Cacatua species."

Following data matching and management, the deep neural networks (DNN) model was applied, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) value was calculated to ensure the accuracy of the model.  Results: As we evaluated the DNN model with MAPE, the multivariate model of air pollution including exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and other atmospheric factors predict approximately 85% of the number of patients with periodontitis. The MAPE value ranged from 12.85 to 17.10 (mean±standard deviation=14.12±1.30), indicating a commendable level of accuracy. Conclusion: In this study, the predictive model for the number of patients with periodontitis is developed based on air pollution, including exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and other atmospheric factors.

We investigated patterns of honeybees and bumblebees near their hives as a basis for calculating bee traffic using the image deep learning. The flight pattern near the hive differed significantly according to bee at entering and leaving the hive. Honeybees mainly showed flight that changed flight direction more than once (69.5%), whereas bumblebees mainly performed straight flight (48.7%) or had a single turn (36.5%) in flight. When bees entered the hive, honeybees primarily showed one-turn or two-turn flight patterns(88.5%), and bumblebees showed a one-turn flight pattern (48.0%). In contrast, when leaving the hive, honeybees primarily showed a straight flight pattern (63.0%), and bumblebees primarily showed a straight or one-turn pattern (90.5%). There was a significant difference in flight speed according to the flight pattern. The speed of straight flight (0.89±0.47 m/s) was 1.5 to 2.1 times faster than flight where direction changed.

Shoreline change detection is vital for shoreline monitoring; however, traditional methods used for such detection are laborious and have limited accuracy. An approach that integrates remote sensing imagery and geographic information systems (GISs) is proposed herein to simultaneously identify shoreline changes and perform grid-level visualization for updating shoreline data. The integrated approach uses deep learning–based segmentation networks and water indexes to accurately classify land and sea in remote sensing images. Transfer learning was used to address the issue of insufficient data, wherein weights trained on a large open dataset were applied to the target area. The segmentation results were compared with existing shoreline GIS data to identify the areas experiencing shoreline changes. Grid-level visualization enhanced the identification of regions requiring flexible data updates and investigation efficiency by focusing on specific areas. The proposed approach accurately detected shoreline changes, albeit with some errors of commission, predominantly in regions featuring intricate shorelines and small clusters of islands. The proposed approach offers efficient solutions for shoreline change detection, with potential applications in coastal management, environmental science, urban planning, and coastal hazard assessment."
Anomaly detection of unbalanced rotating shaft based on deep learning and thresholds,2024,"['Bearing', 'Anomaly detection', 'Deep learning', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Threshold']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Motors are important machines used in various industries. They provide power to various pumps, air compressors, refrigeration plants, purifiers, and air-conditioning plants. However, the motor may not be optimally coupled with the driven machinery during the repair process, and the bearings may become damaged over time as the machine operates. These problems can cause an imbalance in the motor shaft, thus resulting in vibrations. Therefore, vibrations and abnormal indicators must be detected timely to ensure machine safety. A deep-learning model for anomaly detection based on publicly available bearing data was developed in this study. Bearing data from various experiments were plotted and their characteristics were analyzed. Additionally, the vibration amplitude graphs of certain sections were saved as images. The saved images were categorized into normal and abnormal, and then classified using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Evaluation of the model performance on the test set for the trained CNN model shows an accuracy of 0.95, which indicates that the model performs well in distinguishing between normal and abnormal vibration amplitudes.Furthermore, anomaly detection based on vibration-amplitude threshold values was performed."

A Study of Novel Initial Fire Detection Algorithm Based on Deep Learning Method,2024,['Initial fi re detection · Smoke detector · Thermal camera · Deep learning · Yolo'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"A small ember, created by a chemical reaction between a substance and oxygen, can grow into a large fi re as temperature, wind, and weather conditions change. A growing fi re incident can have devastating consequences, including property loss, environmental damage, and loss of life, which is why early fi re detection is so important. There are various detection devices such as smoke detectors, heat detectors, fi re detectors, and gas detectors that can be used in the early stages of a fi re. While early fi re detection system developments incorporating IoT technology are emerging in various industries, Smoke alarms, the most common type of smoke detector in homes and offi ces, accounted for 96.6% of all malfunctions from 2021 to July of the previous year, totaling 249,445 incidents. The analysis of detector malfunctions showed that non-fi re alarm factors such as food, cooking, and dust accounted for the largest share of 40.6%. This paper proposes an algorithm for early fi re detection by incorporating a deep learning-based model to compensate for the problem of non-fi re warning malfunctions, which is a shortcoming of existing detectors. Finally, for fi re detection, a bounding box for the fi re is specifi ed using a smoke detector, a thermal imaging camera, and a webcam camera trained with the Yolov7 model.Then, we propose an algorithm to remove the bounding box of non-fi re reports and malfunctions from the heating map using smoke detectors and thermal imaging cameras. After applying the algorithm proposed in this paper, only fi res with heat sources are recognized, and all bounding boxes for non-fi re reports are removed."

Improved Deep Learning-based Approach for Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Planning via Predictive Modeling of Future Location,2024,"['Intelligent Transportation System', 'trajectory planning', 'future location', 'Location-Based Social Networks']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous systems like robotics and UAVs, as it determines optimal, safe paths considering physical limitations, environmental factors, and agent interactions. Recent advancements in trajectory planning and future location prediction stem from rapid progress in machine learning and optimization algorithms. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for Spatial-temporal transformer-based feed-forward neural networks (STTFFNs). From the traffic flow local area point of view, skip-gram model is trained on trajectory data to generate embeddings that capture the high-level features of different trajectories. These embeddings can then be used as input to a transformer-based trajectory planning model, which can generate trajectories for new objects based on the embeddings of similar trajectories in the training data. In the next step, distant regions, we embedded feedforward network is responsible for generating the distant trajectories by taking as input a set of features that represent the object's current state and historical data. One advantage of using feedforward networks for distant trajectory planning is their ability to capture long-term dependencies in the data. In the final step of forecasting for future locations, the encoder and decoder are crucial parts of the proposed technique. Spatial destinations are encoded utilizing location-based social networks(LBSN) based on visiting semantic locations. The model has been specially trained to forecast future locations using precise longitude and latitude values. Following rigorous testing on two real-world datasets, Porto and Manhattan, it was discovered that the model outperformed a prediction accuracy of 8.7% previous state-of-the-art methods."

Pose estimation in space is crucial for automatic rendezvous docking and inter-spacecraft communication.Owing to the difficulty in training deep learning models in space, we showed that actual experimental results could be predicted through software simulations on the ground. We integrated deep learning with nonlinear least squares (NLS) to predict the pose from a single spacecraft image in real time.

Improving Deep Learning Models Considering the Time Lags between Explanatory and Response Variables,2024,"['Deep Learning', 'Model Optimization', 'Regression Model', 'Time Lag']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A regression model represents the relationship between explanatory and response variables. In real life,explanatory variables often affect a response variable with a certain time lag, rather than immediately. Forexample, the marriage rate affects the birth rate with a time lag of 1 to 2 years. Although deep learning modelshave been successfully used to model various relationships, most of them do not consider the time lags betweenexplanatory and response variables. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an extension of deep learning models,which automatically finds the time lags between explanatory and response variables. The proposed methodfinds out which of the past values of the explanatory variables minimize the error of the model, and uses thefound values to determine the time lag between each explanatory variable and response variables. After determiningthe time lags between explanatory and response variables, the proposed method trains the deep learningmodel again by reflecting these time lags. Through various experiments applying the proposed method to a fewdeep learning models, we confirm that the proposed method can find a more accurate model whose error isreduced by more than 60% compared to the original model."

While much work on landslide susceptibility have been done worldwide, understanding society’s vulnerability to landslides, considering house structure and socio-economic conditions, remains lacking. This research presents landslide vulnerability mapping using  advanced computing deep learning models in the Nilgiri district, India. Compared to traditional ML techniques, the deep learning neural network (DLNN) architecture demonstrates greater accuracy, particularly when dealing with more samples or significant amounts of big data. Although the standardized characteristics of multi-layer NNs  are widely known, the key benefit of DL is its organized method for training DLNN-layer organizations how to govern themselves. Therefore, one deep learning neural network and three conventional machine learning models i.e., MLP classifier and RBF neural network were opted. A total of twenty-eight physical, climatological, hydrological and socio-economic factors were considered to produce socio-economic and relative landslide vulnerability maps. Multi-collinearity diagnosis was performed to  select the appropriate factors. Several physical as well as human related factors are highly important for making the area vulnerable to landslide. To justify the vulnerability maps, several statistical methods were applied. The best model DLNN, with an area under the curve of 89.07%, shows that 43.31%, and 37.72% of areas are highly to very-highly vulnerable to landslides. The framework presented in this work establishes an ideal link between human activities and landslide vulnerability, aiding planners in making informed decisions for landslide management."

The performance of practical thresholds for the modelgenerated confidence score, as determined from the ITS, was verified using the ETS.Results: The AP values for the ITS and ETS were 0.952 and 0.936, respectively. Two confidence thresholds, CT<sub>opt</sub> and CT<sub>precision</sub>, were set at 0.557 and 0.790, respectively. For the ETS, the perimage precision and recall were 95.7% and 80.0% with CT<sub>opt</sub>, and 98.4% and 44.3% with CT<sub>precision</sub>. For per-patient diagnosis, the sensitivity and specificity were 100.0% and 97.1% with CT<sub>opt</sub>, and 100.0% and 99.0% with CT<sub>precision</sub>.

Spinach leaf disease identification based on deep learning techniques,2024,['Vegetable disease\xa0· Spinach leaf\xa0· Deep learning\xa0· Spatial attention mechanism'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Spinach is a high-nutritional-value vegetable. However, global warming, climate change, and other essential elements, such as pests, have a negative impact on spinach growth and produce many diseases that limit and destroy the production of healthy crops, making early and correct identifcation of these diseases critical. Many studies in recent years have employed deep learning models to automatically diagnose vegetable leaf diseases. However, many of these methods are based on separate deep learning architectures, ignoring the diferent efects of diferent channels and spatial location relationships in the fea- ture map on classifcation, resulting in insufcient image representation. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated deep learning system for automatic recognition of spinach leaf disease. First, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to repeatedly train and extract important features from shallow layers to enhance the recognition of the network. Second, a novel spatial attention mechanism is introduced, which decomposes the two-dimensional space into horizontal and vertical dimensions. While paying attention to the local area, the attention weight can be mapped to the adjacent position of the lesion area, providing rich features for the model. Finally, the outer product matrix of the attention mechanism is kerneled to model the nonlinear relationship between channels using a Sigmoid kernel function, and the fnal classifcation is completed by a softmax layer. Experimental results demonstrate that the correct classifcation rate is 95.12 on our test set. This fnding demonstrates the reliability of the proposed hybrid model as an automatic identifer of spinach plant diseases, which can signifcantly contribute to providing better solutions for identifying other crop diseases in the agricultural feld."

The ConvLSTM and CNN+GRU models also achieved higher accuracy than the original SSBD dataset. Through this research, we underscore AI's potential in early ASD detection by automating the identification of stereotypic behaviors, thereby enabling timely intervention. We also emphasize the significance of utilizing expanded datasets from social media platform videos in augmenting model accuracy and robustness, thus paving the way for more accessible diagnostic methods."

Super‑resolution deep learning image reconstruction: image quality and myocardial homogeneity in coronary computed tomography angiography,2024,"['Coronary vessel', 'Multidetector computed tomography', 'Image reconstruction', 'Myocardium']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background The recently introduced super-resolution (SR) deep learning image reconstruction (DLR) is potentially effective in reducing noise level and enhancing the spatial resolution. We aimed to investigate whether SR-DLR has advantages in the overall image quality and intensity homogeneity on coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography with four different approaches: filtered-back projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction (IR), DLR, and SR-DLR. Methods Sixty-three patients (mean age, 61 ± 11 years; range, 18–81 years; 40 men) who had undergone coronary CT angiography between June and October 2022 were retrospectively included. Image noise, signal to noise ratio, and contrast to noise ratio were quantified in both proximal and distal segments of the major coronary arteries. The left ventricle myocardium contrast homogeneity was analyzed. Two independent reviewers scored overall image quality, image noise, image sharpness, and myocardial homogeneity. Results Image noise in Hounsfield units (HU) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) for the SR-DLR (11.2 ± 2.0 HU) compared to those associated with other image reconstruction methods including FBP (30.5 ± 10.5 HU), hybrid IR (20.0 ± 5.4 HU), and DLR (14.2 ± 2.5 HU) in both proximal and distal segments. SR-DLR significantly improved signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio in both the proximal and distal segments of the major coronary arteries. No significant difference was observed in the myocardial CT attenuation with SR-DLR among different segments of the left ventricle myocardium (P = 0.345). Conversely, FBP and hybrid IR resulted in inhomogeneous myocardial CT attenuation (P < 0.001). Two reviewers graded subjective image quality with SR-DLR higher than other image reconstruction techniques (P < 0.001). Conclusions SR-DLR improved image quality, demonstrated clearer delineation of distal segments of coronary arteries, and was seemingly accurate for quantifying CT attenuation in the myocardium."

Application of deep learning with bivariate models for genomic prediction of sow lifetime productivity-related traits,2024,"['Convolutional Neural Network', 'Deep Learning', 'Epistatic Interaction', 'Genomic Prediction', 'Pig', 'Sow Lifetime Productivity']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: Pig breeders cannot obtain phenotypic information at the time of selection for sow lifetime productivity (SLP). They would benefit from obtaining genetic information of candidate sows. Genomic data interpreted using deep learning (DL) techniques could contribute to the genetic improvement of SLP to maximize farm profitability because DL models capture nonlinear genetic effects such as dominance and epistasis more efficiently than conventional genomic prediction methods based on linear models. This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of DL for the genomic prediction of two SLP-related traits; lifetime number of litters (LNL) and lifetime pig production (LPP).Methods: Two bivariate DL models, convolutional neural network (CNN) and local convolutional neural network (LCNN), were compared with conventional bivariate linear models (i.e., genomic best linear unbiased prediction, Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, and Bayes B). Phenotype and pedigree data were collected from 40,011 sows that had husbandry records. Among these, 3,652 pigs were genotyped using the PorcineSNP60K BeadChip.Results: The best predictive correlation for LNL was obtained with CNN (0.28), followed by LCNN (0.26) and conventional linear models (approximately 0.21). For LPP, the best predictive correlation was also obtained with CNN (0.29), followed by LCNN (0.27) and conventional linear models (approximately 0.25). A similar trend was observed with the mean squared error of prediction for the SLP traits.Conclusion: This study provides an example of a CNN that can outperform against the linear model-based genomic prediction approaches when the nonlinear interaction components are important because LNL and LPP exhibited strong epistatic interaction components. Additionally, our results suggest that applying bivariate DL models could also contribute to the prediction accuracy by utilizing the genetic correlation between LNL and LPP."

It leads to a gradual deterioration in memory, thinking ability, and behavioral and social skills until the person loses his ability to adapt to society. Technological progress in medical imaging and the use of artificial intelligence, has provided the possibility of detecting Alzheimer's disease through medical images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, Deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown great success in analyzing medical images for disease diagnosis and classification. Where CNNs can recognize patterns and objects from images, which makes them ideally suited for this study. In this paper, we proposed to compare the performances of Alzheimer's disease detection by using two deep learning methods: You Only Look Once (YOLO), a CNN-enabled object recognition algorithm, and Visual Geometry Group (VGG16) which is a type of deep convolutional neural network primarily used for image classification. We will compare our results using these modern models Instead of using CNN only like the previous research. In addition, the results showed different levels of accuracy for the various versions of YOLO and the VGG16 model. YOLO v5 reached 56.4% accuracy at 50 epochs and 61.5% accuracy at 100 epochs. YOLO v8, which is for classification, reached 84% accuracy overall at 100 epochs. YOLO v9, which is for object detection overall accuracy of 84.6%. The VGG16 model reached 99% accuracy for training after 25 epochs but only 78% accuracy for testing. Hence, the best model overall is YOLO v9, with the highest overall accuracy of 86.1%."

However, the class imbalance of the dataset often skews prediction models towards the majority class in the segmentation of damaged buildings. This issue is further exacerbated when damaged buildings are categorized into multiple scales, intensifying biases within the models. Hence, this research adopts an algorithm-level method to improve the reliability of post-disaster damage assessment. It proposes a novel loss function named Ordinal Class Distance Penalty Loss (OCDPL), considering the ordinal relationship between classes and penalizing the misclassifications according to the class error distance. Two hyperparameters are also introduced to enable the model to fine-tune the contribution of ordinal relationships on the loss function. The satellite images of hurricane disasters in the xBD dataset were adopted as the case study. The results show that the proposed approach can improve F1 scores and Mean Absolute Error of overall damage level classes.

The arterial- and delayed-phase images were reconstructed using HIR and DLR. Subtracted images of the arterial-phase from the delayed-phase were then added to the original delayed-phase using a denoising filter to generate the final-dark-blood images. Qualitative image quality scores and quantitative parameters were obtained and compared among the three groups of images: Delayed-HIR, Dark-blood-HIR, and Dark-blood-DLR.Results: Compared to Delayed-HIR, Dark-blood-HIR images demonstrated higher qualitative scores in terms of vascular wall visualization and diagnostic confidence index (all P < 0.001). These qualitative scores further improved after applying DLR (Dark-blood-DLR compared to Dark-blood-HIR, all P < 0.001). Dark-blood DLR also showed higher scores for overall image noise than Dark-blood-HIR (P < 0.001). In the quantitative analysis, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) values between the vessel wall and lumen for the bilateral common carotid arteries and brachiocephalic trunk were significantly higher on Darkblood- HIR images than on Delayed-HIR images (all P < 0.05). The CNR values were significantly higher for Dark-blood-DLR than for Dark-blood-HIR in all cervical arteries (all P < 0.001).Conclusion: Compared with Delayed-HIR CTA, the dark-blood method combined with DLR improved CTA image quality and enhanced visualization of the cervical artery wall in patients with TAK."

Hence, comprehending the equilibrium solubility of CO2 in DEA solutions is an essential step in developing and optimizing absorption procedures. In order to predict the CO2 loading capacity in the DEA solutions, four advanced deep learning and machine learning models were developed: recurrent neural networks (RNN), deep neural networks (DNN), random forest (RF), and adaBoost-support vector regression (AdaBoost-SVR). The models predict the capacity of CO2 loading as a function of temperature, CO2 partial pressure, and the concentration of DEA in the solution.Intelligent models were developed employing an extensive database which includes new experimental data points published within recent years, which were not considered in the previous studies.

Polysomnography (PSG) is the standard approach for diagnosing sleep apnea, but it is also an expensive and time-consuming process. It calls for a sleep lab with specifc electrode-based gear and staf with the necessary training. When the subject is sufering from any neurological conditions like Parkinson Disease (PD), all these elements combine to make the process difcult and uncomfortable for the patient. In this work, a real-time video-based and signal-based system for diagnosing sleep apnea in persons with Parkinson's disease is presented. The criteria that are required for the detection of sleep apnea in subjects are heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Here, it is possible to use a smartphone camera to detect and interpret imaging Photoplethysmography (iPPG) signals from video of a user's face in order to assess HR, RR, and oxygen saturation. In order to determine the volumetric changes in the blood fow, iPPG datas are processed in accordance with the video-based monitoring method. The Viola Jones method is employed in this research to identify faces. The iPPG signals are collected using the RGB channel approach after image segmentation to determine the region of interest (ROI) as the forehead. From the collected iPPG signals, the characteristics of the HR, RR, and SpO2 parameters are extracted and mathematically calculated. The time domain and frequency domain features are extracted from the ECG signal of the matching individuals. Using the FeatFaceNet Deep Learning technique, these features are decreased. The Ensemble Boosted SVM (EB-SVM) classifcation algorithm is utilized to categories the data into apneic conditions after feature selection. In the event of an emergency, the project's fnding may also be used to notify the medical assistant. As a result, our method enables remote sleep apnea detection for making the process cost-efective and comfortable for the individuals. The proposed method suggests the following performance indices: accuracy, error, precision, recall, FPR, F1-Score, and processing time."

DenseNet201 was effective in detecting rice quantities up to 140 g, but accurate detection of larger quantities required additional height image data. All architectures achieved high top-1 validation accuracies (96.0%-96.4%), though training times varied significantly. This study emphasizes the importance of diverse training datasets and continuous model refinement to improve segmentation accuracy and efficiency. Integrating image data from top and side views is essential for detecting larger quantities. Enhanced nutrition management using deep learning in institutional food services could lead to increased operational efficiency, cost savings, and data-driven decision-making for inventory and menu planning."

Manual brain tumor segmentation is expensive, time-consuming, error-prone, and dependent on the radiologist's expertise and experience. Manual brain tumor segmentation outcomes by different radiologists for the same patient may differ. Thus, more robust, and dependable methods are needed. Medical imaging researchers produced numerous semi-automatic and fully automatic brain tumor segmentation algorithms using ML pipelines and accurate (handcrafted feature-based, etc.) or data-driven strategies. Current methods use CNN or handmade features such symmetry analysis, alignment-based features analysis, or textural qualities. CNN approaches provide unsupervised features, while manual features model domain knowledge. Cascaded algorithms may outperform feature-based or data-driven like CNN methods. A revolutionary cascaded strategy is presented that intelligently supplies CNN with past information from handmade feature-based ML algorithms. Each patient receives manual ground truth and four MRI modalities (T1, T1c, T2, and FLAIR). Handcrafted characteristics and deep learning are used to segment brain tumors in a Global Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN). The proposed GCNN architecture with two parallel CNNs, CSPathways CNN (CSPCNN) and MRI Pathways CNN (MRIPCNN), segmented BraTS brain tumors with high accuracy. The proposed model achieved a Dice score of 87% higher than the state of the art. This research could improve brain tumor segmentation, helping clinicians diagnose and treat patients."
Real-Time Revolutionizing Internal Defect Detection in Power Transformers by Leveraging Wavelet Transform and Deep Learning LSTM in Cascading Application,2024,['Power transformer  · Real-time inernal fault detection  · LSTM network  · Wavelet transform'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"In recent times, the real-time and online identifi cation and prediction of power transformer malfunctions play a vital part in maintaining the dependability and stability of electrical system operations. Early detection of transformer malfunctions is imperative to prevent unexpected outages and potential blackouts. Not only do such occurrences result in fi nancial losses and physical damage, but they also pose a signifi cant threat to the overall stability and functionality of the electrical grid.Therefore, this paper introduces an innovative approach leveraging long short-term memory techniques, coupled with the features of wavelet transformation, to eff ectively identify and predict internal defects (IDs) in power transformers amidst inrush currents (ICs) in online applications. A key highlight of this approach is its ability to accurately diff erentiate IDs from ICs within a quarter cycle of the fundamental frequency, enabling real-time fault prediction—a capability overlooked in previous research endeavors. Furthermore, a novel technique is proposed to mitigate the adverse impacts of current transformer saturation on the functionality of diff erential relays. The effi cacy of the proposed methodology and the extracted features for deep learning applications is corroborated through a series of MATLAB simulations conducted on a three-phase transformer (33/11 kV, 31.5 MVA). Ultimately, the simulation results and testing validate the remarkable accuracy of 99.65% achieved by the proposed approaches in real-time fault detection for power transformers. This signifi es a signifi cant advancement in enhancing the reliability and operational effi ciency of power systems."

But accurate disease identifi cation is one of the complicated processes due to the existence of noisy contents and irrelevant structure of the original images. In conventional works, various medical image processing techniques have been developed for accurately classifying the types of breast cancer. Still, it confronts diffi culties due to the aspects of increased complexity in computations, error values, false positives, and misclassifi cation outputs. Hence, this research work proposes to develop an optimization-based classifi cation system for the breast cancer identifi cation system. Here, the Gaussian fi ltering and Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) techniques are utilized for preprocessing the original mammogram images by eliminating the noisy contents and enhancing the contrast of an image. Then, the Markov Random Adaptive Segmentation (MRAS) technique is employed for detecting the boundary region based on the random value selection. To make the classifying procedure easier, the set of features is optimally extracted from the segmented region with the help of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). In which, the global best fi tness value is estimated by using the crossover, mutation, and selection operations. Finally, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifi cation technique is utilized for categorizing the image as to whether normal or abnormal with its type. The entire performance analysis of the suggested model is validated and compared using multiple measures during the evaluation. In the proposed method GA performs feature selection and prunes unnecessary features. The major goal is to improve the classifi cation performance while reducing the number of features used. The proposed system GA-CNN provides improved performance results with a reduced error rate.The suggested GA-CNN increases accuracy (98.5), sensitivity (99.38), and specifi city values (98.4) as compared to the existing technique by eff ectively identifying the classed label."

Transcriptome-based deep learning analysis identifies drug candidates targeting protein synthesis and autophagy for the treatment of muscle wasting disorder,2024,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Sarcopenia, the progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass and function, is observed in various conditions, including cancer and aging. The complex molecular biology of sarcopenia has posed challenges for the development of FDA-approved medications, which have mainly focused on dietary supplementation. Targeting a single gene may not be sufficient to address the broad range of processes involved in muscle loss. This study analyzed the gene expression signatures associated with cancer formation and 5-FU chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting. Our findings suggest that dimenhydrinate, a combination of 8-chlorotheophylline and diphenhydramine, is a potential therapeutic for sarcopenia. In vitro experiments demonstrated that dimenhydrinate promotes muscle progenitor cell proliferation through the phosphorylation of Nrf2 by 8-chlorotheophylline and promotes myotube formation through diphenhydramine-induced autophagy. Furthermore, in various in vivo sarcopenia models, dimenhydrinate induced rapid muscle tissue regeneration. It improved muscle regeneration in animals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and facilitated muscle and fat recovery in animals with chemotherapy-induced sarcopenia. As an FDA-approved drug, dimenhydrinate could be applied for sarcopenia treatment after a relatively short development period, providing hope for individuals suffering from this debilitating condition."

Because the characteristics of series arc faults change considerably depending on the load type, their accurate detection and analysis are difficult. We propose a series-arc-fault detector that uses a transfer learning (TL)-based feature fusion model. The model is trained stagewise for various features in the time and frequency domains using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network combined with a long short-term memory model that uses an attention mechanism to accurately detect arc-fault features. To enhance the reliability of the proposed model, we implement an arc-fault generator compliant with the UL1699 stan-dard and acquire high-quality data that suitably reflect the real environment. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 99.99% in classifying series arc faults for five different loads. Hence, a perfor-mance improvement of approximately 1.7% in classification accuracy is reached compared with a feature fusion model that does not incorporate TL-based model transfer and the attention mechanism."

Among them, techniques using object detection models can monitor forest fires over wide areas 24 hours a day. However, detecting forest fires early with traditional object detection models is a very challenging task. While they show decent accuracy for thick smoke and large fires, they show low accuracy for faint smoke and small fires, and frequently generate false positives for lights that are like fires. In this paper, to solve these problems, we focus on leveraging local characteristics such as contours and textures of fire and smoke, which are crucial for accurate detection. Based on this approach, we propose EDAM (Edge driven Attention Module) that performs enhancement by richly utilizing contour and texture information of fire and smoke. EDAM extracts important edge information to generate feature maps with emphasized contour and texture information, and based on this map, performs Attention Mechanism to emphasize key characteristics of smoke and fire. Through this mechanism, the overall model performance was improved, with APsincreasing from 0.154 to 0.204 and AP0.5 from 0.779 to 0.784, resulting in a significant improvement in APsvalue to 32.47%. In practice, the model applying this technique showed excellent inference speed while greatly improving detection performance for small objects compared to existing models and reduced false positive rates for building and street light illumination in nighttime environments that are easily mistaken for fire."

The video encoding technique must compresses the video fles which does not compromise the quality of it. Further, the technique must be suited for any type of devices and the platforms. Studies have been focusing on new video codes frameworks called DVCs (Distributed Video Codings). Prior designs have used DWTs (Discrete Wavelet Transforms) and ELMs (Extreme Learning Machines) in domainbased DVC frameworks. ELM algorithm also resulted in several defects such as poor robustness, overftting problem and poor controllability. To overcome this issue, a new hybrid SI generation scheme utilizing DWTs and BDCNNs (Bernoulli Distribution based Convolution Neural Networks) is proposed in transforming domain-based DVC frameworks. The proposed system works in three phases where the frst stage uses three-level two-dimensional DWTs and Haar wavelets extract approximates coefcients. In the second step, the SAIWCSOs (Simulated Annealing Inertia Weight-based Chicken Swarm Optimisations) technique is used to achieve detailed coefcients optimization after BDCNNs provide the approximated estimation coefcients for the present frameworks. In the third stage, level by- level IDWT techniques retrieve eventual estimated frame Side Information in the spatial domains. The efectiveness of the codec is increased by the higher SI quality. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the suggested system performs better than the current technology regarding PSNR, MSE, and RMSE. When compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the suggested method achieves maximum levels of efectiveness of 30%, 35%, and 32%, correspondingly."

However, the direct applications of the conventional CNNs for low-dose DTS imaging are limited to provide acceptable image quality due to the inaccurate recognition of complex texture patterns. In this study, a deep residual learning network combined with the Anscombe transformation was proposed for simplifying the complex texture and restoring the low-dose DTS image quality. The proposed network consisted of convolution layers, max-pooling layers, up-sampling layers, and skip connections. The network training was performed to learn the residual images between the ground-truth and low-dose projections, which were converted using the Anscombe transformation. As a result, the proposed network enhanced the quantitative accuracy and noise characteristic of DTS images by 1.01–1.27 and 1.14–1.71 times, respectively, in comparison to low-dose DTS images and other deep learning networks. The spatial resolution of the DTS image restored using the proposed network was 1.12 times higher than that obtained using a deep image learning network. In conclusion, the proposed network can restore the low-dose DTS image quality and provide an optimal model for low-dose DTS imaging."

This study proposes a novel Markov decision process model for the multi-objective scheduling problems for the welding process, incorporating setup requirements and due date-related constraints into the state representation, action modelling, and reward design. Additionally, based on the proposed Markov decision process model, this study develops a learning environment in which a discrete-event simulation model of the welding process is integrated for state transition considering the uncertainties in the welding process. In the training phase of the scheduling agent, the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm is applied to learn the scheduling policy, which is approximated by deep neural networks. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated in comparison to four priority rules (SSPT, ATCS, MDD, and COVERT) for various test scenarios with different workloads and levels of variability in processing time."

Deep reinforcement learning for base station switching scheme with federated LSTM-based traffic predictions,2024,"['base station switching', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'federated learning', 'LSTM', 'traffic forecasting']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"To meet increasing traffic requirements in mobile networks, small base stations (SBSs) are densely deployed, overlapping existing network architecture and increasing system capacity. However, densely deployed SBSs increase energy consumption and interference. Although these problems already exist because of densely deployed SBSs, even more SBSs are needed to meet increasing traffic demands. Hence, base station (BS) switching operations have been used to minimize energy consumption while guaranteeing quality-of-service (QoS) for users. In this study, to optimize energy efficiency, we propose the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to create a BS switching operation strategy with a traffic prediction model. First, a federated long short-term memory (LSTM) model is introduced to predict user traffic demands from user trajectory information. Next, the DRL-based BS switching operation scheme determines the switching operations for the SBSs using the predicted traffic demand. Experimental results confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency, signal-to-interference noise ratio, handover metrics, and prediction performance."

Reimagining space layout design through deep reinforcement learning,2024,"['computational design', 'floor plan', 'space layout', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'planning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Space layout design is a critical aspect of architectural design, influencing functionality and aesthetics. The inherent combinatorial nature of layout design poses challenges for traditional planning approaches; thus, it demands the exploration of novel methods. This paper presents a novel framework that leverages the potential of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to optimize space layouts. RL has demonstrated remarkable success in addressing complex decision-making problems, yet its application in the design process remains relatively unexplored. We argue that RL is particularly well-suited for the design process due to its ability to accommodate offline tasks and seamless integration with existing computer-aided design software, effectively acting as a simulator for design exploration. Framing space layout design as an RL problem and employing RL methods allows for the automated exploration of the expansive design space, thereby enhancing the discovery of innovative solutions. This paper also elucidates the synergy between the design process and the RL problem, which opens new avenues for exploring the potential of RL algorithms in design. We aim to foster experimentation and collaboration within the RL and architecture communities. To facilitate our research, we have developed SpaceLayoutGym, an environment specifically designed for space layout design tasks. SpaceLayoutGym serves as a customizable environment that encapsulates the essential elements of the layout design process within an RL framework. To showcase the effectiveness of SpaceLayoutGym and the capabilities of RL as an artificial space layout designer, we employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to train the RL agent in selected design scenarios with both geometrical constraints and topological objectives. The study further extends to contrast the effectiveness of PPO agents with that of genetic algorithms, and also includes a comparative analysis with existing layouts.

Yet, accurately tracking the diet and food intake of individuals with obesity is challenging. Although 3D motion capture technology is becoming increasingly important in healthcare, its potential for detecting early signs of obesity has not been fully explored. In this research, we used a deep LSTM network trained with individual identity (identity-trained deep LSTM network) to analyze 3D time-series skeleton data from mouse models with diet-induced obesity. First, we analyzed the data from two different viewpoints: allocentric and egocentric. Second, we trained various deep recurrent networks (e.g., RNN, GRU, LSTM) to predict the identity. Lastly, we tested whether these models effectively encode obese-like motion representations by training a support vector classifier with the latent features from the last layer. Our experimental results indicate that the optimal performance is achieved when utilizing an identity-trained deep LSTM network in conjunction with an egocentric viewpoint. This approach suggests a new way to use deep learning to spot health risks in mouse models of obesity and should be useful for detecting early signs of obesity in humans."

Object detection refers to the work to perform classification and localization of all objects present in the image when an input image is given. To use an object detection algorithm in a duck cage, data to be used for learning should be made and the data should be augmented to secure enough data to learn from.

Therefore, it is necessary to classify musical genres based on scenes. Identifying favorite musical genres from massive music data is a time-consuming and laborious task. Recent studies have suggested that machine learning algorithms are effective in distinguishing between various musical genres.

The experimental results indicated that this method achieved a 91.54% F1-score and 91.58% top-1 accuracy, outperforming existing approaches. This novel approach leverages deep architecture and conventional machine learning algorithms and provides a new horizon for musical genre classification tasks."

Fault diagnosis of nuclear power plant sliding bearing-rotor systems using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks,2024,"['Nuclear power plants', 'Sliding bearings', 'Deep learning', 'Generative adversarial', 'Fault diagnosis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Sliding bearings are crucial rotating mechanical components in nuclear power plants, and their failures can result in severe economic losses and human casualties. Deep learning provides a new approach to bearing fault diagnosis, but there is currently a lack of a universal fault diagnosis model for studying bearing-rotor systems under various operating conditions, speeds and faults. Research on bearing-rotor systems supported by sliding bearings is limited, leading to insufficient fault data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis model framework for bearing-rotor systems based on a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (TF-DLGAN).

In recent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are popularly used for Generative AI based on Reinforcement Learning. It makes decisions with the most optimal rewards through the fine tuning process in a particular situation. Unfortunately, LLMs can not provide any explanation for how they reach the goal because the training is based on learning of black-box AI. Reinforcement Learning as black-box AI is based on graph-evolving structure for deriving enhanced solution through adjustment by human feedback or reinforced data. In this research, for mutually exclusive decision-making, Mutually Exclusive Learning (MEL) is proposed to provide explanations of the chosen goals that are achieved by a decision on both ends with specified conditions. In MEL, decision-making process is based on the tree-based structure that can provide processes of pruning branches that are used as explanations of how to achieve the goals. The goal can be reached by trade-off among mutually exclusive alternatives according to the specific contextual conditions.Therefore, the tree-based structure is adopted to provide feasible solutions with the explanations based on the pruning branches. The sequence of pruning processes can be used to provide the explanations of the inferences and ways to reach the goals, as Explainable AI (XAI). The learning process is based on the pruning branches according to the multi-dimensional contextual conditions. To deep-dive the search, they are composed of time window to determine the temporal perspective, depth of phases for lookahead and decision criteria to prune branches. The goal depends on the policy of the pruning branches, which can be dynamically changed by configured situation with the specific multi-dimensional contextual conditions at a particular moment. The explanation is represented by the chosen episode among the decision alternatives according to configured situations. In this research, MEL adopts the tree-based learning model to provide explanation for the goal derived with specific conditions. Therefore, as an example of mutually exclusive problems, employment process is proposed to demonstrate the decision-making process of how to reach the goal and explanation by the pruning branches.

Farmers currently clear weeds manually, which is both tiring and imprecise. Therefore, researchers have developed artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning or non-handcrafted methods to facilitate precise detection. However, these methods have yet to achieve real-time inference speeds. Consequently, this study adopts a handcrafted approach that employs visual leaf features for classification via ensemble learning. The objective is to employ feature selection and data normalization to create an accurate and efficient machine-learning model. The experimental findings obtained in this work demonstrate that Information Gain effectively reduces features by 50%, from 22 to 11, while maintaining accuracy. Chebyshev normalization emerges as the most suitable normalization technique, as it significantly enhances classification accuracy in ensemble learning. The accuracy obtained when using histogram gradient boosting is found to be 0.92 with an inference time of 5.955 ms per image. These outcomes illustrate that handcrafted features achieve higher accuracy than non-handcrafted methods, ultimately improving efficiency and enabling real-time implementation."

Airfoil Inverse Design Using a Deep Neural Net with an Explainable Attention Mechanism,2024,['Airfoil · Attention  mechanism · Inverse  design · Recurrent  neural  network · Explainable  artiﬁcial  intelligence (XAI)'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"The data-driven inverse design approach has advantages over traditional methods that require domain knowledge, many constraints, and empirical formulas. However, because deep learning models are basically black-box models, that is, unin- terpretable models, explaining the causal relationship between the input and output using them is difﬁcult. This reduces the reliability of inverse design approaches based on deep learning. Therefore, in this study, an airfoil inverse design using an explainable deep neural network was developed. The airfoil shape parameters were predicted using the pressure coefﬁcient distribution. Because the distribution is considered as undirected sequence data, a bidirectional long short-term memory was used as the base of the network. To provide explainability to the network, we utilized two types of attention-applied network architectures: single-attention and multi-attention. This makes the network more accurate and explainable with good convergence. Consequently, a purely data-driven inverse design approach that does not require domain experience was estab- lished. Furthermore, a self-explanatory network without additional data mining was modeled. This attention-applied network performed predictions not only to obtain the airfoil geometry but also to determine the correlation between airfoil geometry and the local pressure distribution. The correlation obtained from the network was shown to properly reﬂect the physics of ﬂow, thereby conﬁrming that the present approach can be used to analyze physical phenomena, particularly those whose mechanisms have not yet been identiﬁed."

The authors created 3D images of soft tissue lesions using open-source software and evaluated their usefulness through four clinical cases.Methods: Patients with wounds or soft tissue lesions underwent enhanced tomography. The surgeon manually segmented the ROIs and reconstructed them using 3D Slicer. The reconstructed images were overlaid on an anatomy plate or clinical pictures for clinical application. The authors conducted hands-on training and surveyed the participants before and after the course to evaluate clinical applicability and efficacy.Results: Nine plastic surgeons were enrolled. After training, their perception of applying 3D imaging on deep pus pocket drainage, foreign body removal, and deep-located lesion biopsy remained unchanged. However, their response significantly changed from likely to very likely in whether 3D reconstruction imaging of deep soft tissue lesions would help improve the surgical outcome. They answered positively in their recommendation of 3D reconstruction and its application to clinical practice. However, they responded neutrally to whether it was easy to learn. This method was found most useful for deep lesion excision planning, followed by drainage of deep concealed pus pockets, foreign body removal, and biopsies of lesions difficult to localize.Conclusion: Surgeon-generated 3D reconstruction of wounds and soft tissue lesions using open-source software can aid clinical practice, significantly improving surgical outcomes in deep soft tissue lesions."

Development of a Real-Time Anomaly Detection System for Dry Vacuum Pumps Using Low-Cost IoT Devices and Machine Learning,2024,"['Anomaly detection', 'Machine learning', 'IoT device', 'Low-cost', 'Vacuum pump']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Data-driven health diagnosis methods based on machine learning have been receiving a lot of attention with the hope that they can open a new era for mechanical researchers and engineers. Machine learning algorithms including deep learning can show insights or state trends through complicated electro-mechanical sensor signals, but it is difficult for machine learning algorithms to go beyond the given data boundaries and to generalize their inferring rules from one case to the other. Researchers have even artificially damaged common mechanical parts in their experiments to collect fault signals for machine learning training. Creating and gathering the sensor signals covering a variety of machine status may be time-consuming or impossible in reality. Anomaly detection for dry vacuum pumps started from the recognition that the artificially induced fault signals may not reflect the natural malfunctioning state of the pumps. Anomaly detection algorithms use only normal data for training, so abnormal state data is not necessarily required. In this research several anomaly detection algorithms were tested and compared with time-domain input features and frequency-domain input features when acceleration signals were injected in for training. A long short-term memory based autoencoder (LSTM-autoencoder) scheme with discrete wavelet transformed (DWT) input signals was chosen for the finalist due to its superior capability capturing the nature of normal state characteristics. The output of LSTM-autoencoder’s loss could be used as an indicator of the machine’s health deterioration. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated that the developed algorithm worked well on low-cost Internet of Things devices such as Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino Mega 2560 boards for real-time monitoring."

It is not preventable. Early and precise detection is the only remedy for lowering the rate of mortality and improving the probability of survival for victims. In contrast to present procedures, thermography aids in the early diagnosis of cancer and thereby saves lives. But the accuracy experiences detrimental impact by low sensitivity for small and deep tumours and the subjectivity by physicians in interpreting the images.

However, recent fault diagnosis methods, particularly the methods using deep learning, require a massive amount of labeled data, which may not be available in industrial fields. Few-shot learning has been recently applied in fault diagnosis for rotary machineries, to alleviate the data deficiency and/or to enable unseen fault diagnosis. However, two major obstacles still remain, specifically: (i) the limited ability of the models to be generalized for use under new operating conditions and (ii) insufficient discriminative features to precisely diagnose fault types. To address these limitations, this study proposes a Prototype-assisted dual-Contrastive learning with Depthwise separable Convolutional neural network (PCDC) for few-shot fault diagnosis for permanent magnet synchronous motors under new working conditions. Operation-robust fault features are extracted to reinforce generalization of PCDC under new operating conditions by extracting fault-induced amplitude and frequency modulation features and by eliminating the influence of operating conditions from the motor stator current signals. Prototype-assisted dual-contrastive learning is proposed to clearly distinguish the fault categories even when the fault features are similar to each other by learning both local- and global-similarity features, which increases the instance-discrimination ability while alleviating an overfitting issue. Experimental results show that the proposed PCDC outperforms the comparison models in few-shot fault diagnosis tasks under new operating conditions."

Selective imitation for efficient online reinforcement learning with pre-collected data,2024,['Deep reinforcement learningOff-policy reinforcement learningPre-collected dataBehavioral cloningImitation learning'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising solution for autonomous devices requiring sequential decision-making. In the online RL framework, the agent must interact with the environment to collect data, making sample efficiency the most challenging aspect. While the off-policy method in online RL partially addresses this issue by employing a replay buffer, learning speed remains slow, particularly at the beginning of training, due to the low quality of data collected with the initial policy. To overcome this challenge, we propose Reward-Adaptive Pre-collected Data RL (RAPD-RL), which leverages pre-collected data in addition to online RL. We employ two buffers: one for pre-collected data and another for online collected data. The policy is trained using both buffers to increase the objective and imitate the actions in the dataset. To maintain resistance to poor-quality (i.e., low-reward) data, our method selectively imitates data based on reward information, thereby enhancing sample efficiency and learning speed.

Modeling Method for Classification of Piano Music Style based on Big Data Mining and Machine Learning,2024,"['Big data mining', 'Machine learning', 'Piano music', 'Hidden Markov']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"With the progress of music digitalization, various styles of music have been produced, and effective classification of music has become an important research direction. In this research, a model for piano-music style classification was constructed based on big data mining and machine learning algorithms. The input music signal was dealt with using framing, signal enhancement, and windowing. The Meldor Frequency Coefficient (MFC) and emotional features in the signal were extracted and fused to obtain combined features. The extracted feature vectors were input into a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for training and then a hidden Markov model (HMM) for classification and recognition. However, it was found that during the HMM training process, the algorithm produces large differences in the randomly selected initial matrix parameters, which cause the results to be trapped at a local optimum and affect the accuracy of model classification and recognition. To optimize the parameters, a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the classification model. The average Relative Percent Difference (PRD) was 2.402, the run time was 2.117 s, and the accuracy was 97.074%, which means the model can efficiently and accurately classify piano music styles."
Hybrid LSTM and Deep Belief Networks with Attention Mechanism for Accurate Heart Attack Data Analytics,2024,"['Heart Data mining', 'Heart attack prediction', 'Machine learning', 'Deep learning', 'Long short-term memory', 'Deep belief networks', 'Autoencoder']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Due to its complexity and high diagnosis and treatment costs, heart attack (HA) is the top cause of death globally. Heart failure's widespread effect and high morbidity and death rates make accurate and fast prognosis and diagnosis crucial. Due to the complexity of medical data, early and accurate prediction of HA is difficult. Healthcare providers must evaluate data quickly and accurately to intervene. This novel hybrid approach predicts HA using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Deep belief networks (DBNs) with attention mechanism, and robust data mining to fill this essential gap. HA is predicted using Kaggle, PhysioNet, and UCI datasets. Wearable sensor data, ECG signals, and demographic and clinical data provide a solid analytical base. To maintain consistency, ECG signals are normalized and segmented after thorough cleaning to remove missing values and noise. Feature extraction employs complex approaches like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders to pick time-domain (MNN, SDNN, RMSSD, PNN50) and frequency-domain (PSD at VLF, LF, HF bands) characteristics. The hybrid model architecture uses LSTM networks for sequence learning and DBNs for feature representation and selection to create a robust and comprehensive prediction model. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are measured after cross-entropy loss and SGD optimization. The LSTM-DBN model outperforms predictive methods in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The findings show that several data sources and powerful algorithms can improve heart attack predictions. The proposed architecture performed well on many datasets, with an accuracy rate of 96.00%, sensitivity of 98%, AUC of 0.98, and F1-score of 0.97. High performance proves this system's dependability. Moreover, the proposed approach is outperformed compared to state-of-the-art systems."

Due to the limitations in complex scenes, it is necessary to establish custom template matching and apply it to the research of many fields of computational vision technology. The dependence on high-quality small label sample database data is not very strong, and the machine learning system of deep feature connection to complete the task of texture effect inference and speculation is relatively poor. The style transfer algorithm based on neural network collects and preserves the data of patterns, extracts and modernizes their features.

Hull form optimization of fully parameterized small ships using characteristic curves and deep neural networks,2024,"['Hull form design', 'Characteristic curves', 'Hydrodynamic performance', 'Deep learning', 'Deep Neural Network (DNN)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Designing a hull form typically involves beginning with a reference hull form based on ship owner requirements, editing the hull form to satisfy the requirements, and determining the most efficient hull form. Numerical analyses using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) were employed to assess the performance of the hull form.However, these analyses require extensive computational resources, making it challenging to perform thorough analyses within the design timeframe. To address this issue, this paper proposes an approach that involves defining a range of hull forms with characteristic curves, predicting their performance using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and subsequently determining the optimal hull form based on these predictions. Initially, the hull form of a small ship was defined using four characteristic curves and parameterized using 29 variables. Fairness optimization was performed using these characteristic curves to define the hull form surface. By varying 29 parameters, 896 different hull forms were generated, with CFD analysis conducted for each variant. These data were then used to build a DNN model capable of predicting the performance based on hull form parameters. The accuracy of the DNN model was evaluated, resulting in a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.835%. Subsequently, the DNN model is combined with a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal set of parameters for the hull form, resulting in an optimal hull form. This optimization process revealed that the optimal hull form reduced the total hydrodynamic resistance by approximately 7% compared to the initial reference design. Consequently, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for deriving the optimal hull form for small ships."

To this end, we report on three experiments that evaluate BERT’s understanding of reference resolution differences between personal pronouns and reflexives in possessor-less and possessed PNPs. Our experiments show that BERT exhibits human-like referential preferences with reflexives but not with personal pronouns. The findings for reflexive resolution suggest that BERT’s deep learning training does not solely rely on frequency information but serves as a mechanism for acquiring more systematic linguistic soft constraints Moreover, the different resolution patterns from the pronouns could be attributed to the reflexives’ more explicit referential dependency and their relatively low frequency."

This study aims to develop a deep-learning model for automating this process, evaluating its accuracy, and determining the minimum dataset size for effective performance.Materials and Method Voice data from 524 individuals with pathological conditions and 502 individuals with normal conditions, totaling 1026 samples, were used. Each voice sample had 17 chunks, including a “summer” sentence (15 chunks) and vowels /α/ and /i/.

This study evaluated performance using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, commonly employed in artificial intelligence-based image detection for chunk segmentation.Results The accuracy of chunk identification at the frame level was 96.47%. Using IoU metrics, chunk segmentation accuracy was 98.15% at IoU ≥0.6, 96.03% at IoU ≥0.7, and 89.78% at IoU ≥0.8. Optimal dataset size exploration indicated that more than 700 connected speech datasets were needed for successful training, maintaining F1-scores up to 95% at IoU ≥0.7.Conclusion The artificial intelligence model is suitable for the development of an automated system that efficiently divides segments in the institutional collection of voice data.

This problem directly impacts the reliability of the tunnel CCTV-based accident detection system reliant on object detection performance. Hence, it is necessary to reduce the number of false positive detections while also enhancing the number of true positive detections. Based on a deep learning object detection model, this paper proposes a false positive data training method that not only reduces false positives but also improves true positive detection performance through retraining of false positive data. This paper’s false positive data training method is based on the following steps: initial training of a training dataset - inference of a validation dataset - correction of false positive data and dataset composition - addition to the training dataset and retraining. In this paper, experiments were conducted to verify the performance of this method. First, the optimal hyperparameters of the deep learning object detection model to be applied in this experiment were determined through previous experiments. Then, in this experiment, training image format was determined, and experiments were conducted sequentially to check the long-termperformance improvement through retraining of repeated false detection datasets. As a result, in the first experiment, it was found that the inclusion of the background in the inferred image was more advantageous for object detection performance than the removal of the background excluding the object. In the second experiment, it was found that retraining by accumulating false positives from each level of retraining was more advantageous than retraining independently for each level of retraining in terms of continuous improvement of object detection performance. After retraining the false positive data with the method determined in the two experiments, the car object class showed excellent inference performance with an AP value of 0.95 or higher after the first retraining, and by the fifth retraining, the inference performance was improved by about 1.06 times compared to the initial inference. And the person object class continued to improve its inference performance as retraining progressed, and by the 18th retraining, it showed that it could self-improve its inference performance by more than 2.3 times compared to the initial inference."

Data preprocessing included the removal of outliers and selection of relevant variables. Various modeling techniques, including regression analysis, classification and regression tree (CART), and artificial neural network (ANN), were applied to predict the heat of hydration and early compressive strength of concrete. The models were evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) to determine their effectiveness.The ANN model demonstrated superior performance, achieving a high prediction accuracy for early-age concrete strength, with an MAE of 0.297 and a predictive accuracy of 99.8%. For heat-of-hydration temperature prediction, the ANN model also outperformed the regression and CART models, exhibiting a lower MAE of 1.395.

The ability of an ANN model to handle non-linear relationships and complex interactions among variables makes it a promising tool for real-time quality control in construction.

In this study, a deep-learning-based software is designed and proposed to guide UAM vehicles through aircraft marshalling, especially during critical maneuvers, such as takeoff, landing, and ground movements. A bounding-box-based object detection algorithm is utilized to differentiate effectively between pedestrians and aircraft security personnel, thereby recognizing objects of interest. Upon detection of aircraft marshalling, the proposed algorithm identifies and interprets the marshalling signals. Then, the information is converted into control commands that are transmitted to the UAM vehicle.

Performance evaluation was also done not only against two deep learning algorithms but also against those adopting two transfer learning strategies, one for freezing all hidden layers developed from the pre-trained model and the other for training the last hidden layer only among multiple ones, with respect to Mean Squared Error (MSE). We found that the performance of both CNN and LSTM was relatively comparative regardless of dependent variables, discharge and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), whereas the prediction accuracy of both algorithms was slightly higher for discharge than for BOD due to its low variability. When transfer learning which froze all hidden layers of the existing model was applied to two benchmark algorithms, the predictive performance of both algorithms was found to slightly improved only for discharge. Also, there was no measurable variation in the prediction accuracy of benchmark algorithms using the other transfer learning approach.Potential applications of transfer learning include the rapid reuse of the existing models (developed from source domains) for target domains which are hard to develop new prediction models due to the lack of data in deep learning."""

Accurately identifying and eliminating these factors that complicate satellite image analysis is essential for maintaining the reliability of remote sensing imagery. For this reason, satellites such as Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Compact Advanced Satellite 500-1 (CAS500-1) provide Usable Data Masks(UDMs)with images as part of their Analysis Ready Data (ARD) product. Precise detection of clouds and their shadows is crucial for the accurate construction of these UDMs. Existing cloud and their shadow detection methods are categorized into threshold-based methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods. Recently, AI-based methods, particularly deep learning networks, have been preferred due to their advantage in handling large datasets. This study aims to analyze the applicability of constructing UDMs for high-resolution satellite images through deep learning-based cloud and their shadow detection using open-source datasets. To validate the performance of the deep learning network, we compared the detection results generated by the network with pre-existing UDMs from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and CAS500-1 satellite images. The results demonstrated that high accuracy in the detection outcomes produced by the deep learning network. Additionally, we applied the network to detect cloud and their shadow in KOMPSAT-3/3A images, which do not provide UDMs. The experiment confirmed that the deep learning network effectively detected cloud and their shadow in high-resolution satellite images. Through this, we could demonstrate the applicability that UDM data for high-resolution satellite imagery can be constructed using the deep learning network."

The model was validated using quantitative metrics, including the Hit Rate (HR), False Alarm Ratio (FAR), and Critical Success Index (CSI), by comparing the maximum inundation depth analysis results of the 2014 and 2020 historical flood events to those of the physically based model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of temporal variability in rainfall on the performance of the deep learning model. The maximum inundation depth simulation exhibited high reproducibility, with an HR value of 0.98, an FAR of 0.12, and a CSI of 0.85 for the 2014 event, and an HR value of 0.92, an FAR of 0.19, and a CSI of 0.76 for the 2020 event. The analysis of rainfall window size indicated that the CNN model achieved optimal performance with a 6-hour rainfall window for the 2014 event and a 2-hour window for the 2020 event.

These loads cause the initial crack growth or the occurrence and growth of new cracks in the structure. The cracks generated lead to structural defects and adversely affect the parts. In order to evaluate the safety of the structure against cracks in advance, the stress intensity factor is calculated through finite element analysis. This process requires repetitive finite element analysis of a large number of cracks and requires a lot of time and effort.

Therefore, to alleviate these issues, this study aims to utilize modern artificial intelligence technology to automate the fractographic analysis of laminated composites. To accomplish this goal, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of fractured tensile test specimens are obtained from laminated composites to showcase various fracture modes. These SEM images are then categorized based on numerous fracture modes, including fiber breakage, fiber pull-out, mix-mode fracture, matrix brittle fracture, and matrix ductile fracture. Next, the collective data for all classes are divided into train, test, and validation datasets. Two state-of-the-art, deep learning-based pre-trained models, namely, DenseNet and GoogleNet, are trained to learn the discriminative features for each fracture mode. The DenseNet models shows training and testing accuracies of 94.01% and 75.49%, respectively, whereas those of the GoogleNet model are 84.55% and 54.48%, respectively.

This study presents an algorithm for estimating rice planting density in agriculture using drone-captured images and deep learning-based image analysis technology. The algorithm utilizes images collected from various paddies; these images are processed through pre-processing steps and serve as training data for the YOLOv5x deep learning model. The trained model demonstrated high precision and recall, effectively estimating the position information of rice plants in each image. By accurately estimating the position of rice plants based on the central coordinates in diverse unpaved environments, the model allowed for estimation of rice plant density in each paddy, producing values closely aligned with actual measurements. Moreover, the algorithm proposed in this study provides a novel approach for precise determination of rice planting density based on the position information of rice plants in the images.Analysis of drone footage from different regions capturing portions of paddies revealed that the developed algorithm exhibited a significant correlation (R2=0.877) with actual planting density. This finding suggests the potential effective application of the algorithm in real-world agricultural settings. In conclusion, we believe that this research contributes to the ongoing digital transformation in agriculture by offering a valuable technology that supports the goals of enhancing efficiency, mitigating methane emissions, and achieving carbon neutrality, in response to the challenges posed by climate change."

The study proposes a method to compensate for the bias error of the measured sound intensity vector according to the Helmholtz numbers by applying deep learning. The method makes it possible to estimate the accurate direction of arrival of the source by applying a dense layer-based deep learning model that derives compensated sound intensity vectors when inputting the sound intensity vectors measured by a tetrahedral microphone array for the Helmholtz numbers. The model is verified based on simulation data for all sound source directions with 0.1 < kd < 3.0.

However, when groundwater monitoring wells are newly developed or when a significant portion of the data is invalid (for example, due to missing values or outliers), acquiring an adequate dataset for training prediction models becomes challenging, leading to diminished prediction accuracy. This study proposes a method based on transfer learning to address the issue of insufficient training data. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) was used as the primary data-driven model for predictions. A GRU-based pretrained network for the transfer learning process was developed using groundwater level and corresponding rainfall data collected from 89 monitoring stations nationwide. Subsequently, this pretrained network was fine-tuned using a small amount of training data obtained from the target monitoring well to develop the final prediction model. To verify the effectiveness of the transfer learning algorithm, two different groundwater level prediction models were evaluated: 1) a GRU-based model trained with insufficient data from the target well, and 2) a GRU-based model utilizing the transfer learning algorithm. Comparative verification was conducted with groundwater level data obtained from wells at two different locations, where the model using the transfer learning algorithm demonstrated superior performance compared to the other. This study confirms that the transfer learning algorithm can significantly enhance the performance of groundwater level prediction models, irrespective of the amount of available training data."

It also seeks to verify the impact of data preprocessing techniques based on moving average methods on model performance. Commercial areas play a key role in helping businesses and service providers select locations and formulate marketing strategies. To overcome the limitations of traditional circular commercial area analysis methods used in previous studies, this research proposes a method for defining commercial area boundaries based on postal codes provided during the registration process, which can be linked to national public data. The study aggregates rechargeable prepaid card approval data from the Dongbaekjeon Payments system by postal code area and presents the most efficient moving average-based data preprocessing method along with the optimal deep learning model for predicting the growth of selected emerging commercial areas using time-series data. In particular, the study employs RNN models, including RNN-based models such as LSTM and GRU, to train and predict on preprocessed time-series data. The results indicate that using the GRU model with data preprocessed by the Simple Moving Average method, trained within the Random Seed range of 1 to 127, yielded an average R² value of 0.89, with a standard deviation of 0.05, demonstrating highly stable and superior performance. This study suggests that data preprocessing based on moving average methods, including Simple Moving Average (SMA), Triangular Moving Average (TMA), Weighted Moving Average (WMA), and Exponential Moving Average (EMA), significantly impacts the predictive performance of deep learning models. Tailored moving average-based preprocessing techniques can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of time-series data learning and prediction in financial markets and various industries."

CMP mainly requires the use of polyurethane-based polishing pads as an ultraprecise process to achieve mechanical material removal and the required chemical reactions. A diamond disk performs pad conditioning to remove processing residues on the pad surface and maintain sufficient surface roughness during CMP. However, the diamond grits attached to the disk cause uneven wear of the pad, leading to the poor uniformity of material removal during CMP. This study investigates the pad wear rate profile according to the swing motion of the conditioner during swing-arm-type CMP conditioning using deep learning. During conditioning, the motion of the swing arm is independently controlled in eight zones of the same pad radius. The experiment includes six swing-motion conditions to obtain actual data on the pad wear rate profile, and deep learning learns the pad wear rate profile obtained in the experiment. The absolute average error rate between the experimental values and learning results is 0.01%. This finding confirms that the experimental results can be well represented by learning.

In this study, UWB technologyis used as a means of fine alignment, a process in the wireless power transmission system. To determine the applicability to an actualautonomous vehicle wireless power transmission system, experiments were conducted based on distance, and the distance informationwas collected from UWB.

Facial recognition technology is widely used in edge devices like smartphones, smart home devices, and security systems, but low-light conditions reduce accuracy due to degraded image quality and increased noise. We reviewed the latest techniques, including Zero-DCE, Zero-DCE++, and SCI (Self-Calibrated Illumination), and applied them as preprocessing steps in facial recognition on edge devices. Using the K-face dataset, experiments on the Qualcomm QRB5165 platform showed significant improvements in F1 SCORE from 0.57 to 0.833 with SCI.

As autonomous vehicles emerge, there will be a transitional period in which traditional and autonomous vehicles coexist, potentially leading to a higher accident rate. Currently, when a traffic accident occurs, the fault ratio is determined according to the criteria set by the General Insurance Association of Korea. However, the time required to investigate the type of accident is substantial. Additionally, there is an increasing trend in fault ratio disputes, with requests for reconsideration even after the fault ratio has been determined. To reduce these temporal and material costs, we propose a deep learning model that automatically determines fault ratios. In this study, we aimed to determine fault ratios based on accident video through a image classification model based on ResNet-18 and video action recognition using TSN. If this model commercialized, could significantly reduce the time required to measure fault ratios. Moreover, it provides an objective metric for fault ratios that can be offered to the parties involved, potentially alleviating fault ratio disputes."

However, these products may contain foreign substances coming from manufacturing process such as iron, aluminum, plastic and so on, which could lead to serious problems or malfunctioning of the product, and fire on the electric vehicle. To solve these problems, it is necessary to determine whether there are foreign materials inside the product, and may tests have been done by means of non-destructive testing methodology such as ultrasound ot X-ray. Nevertheless, there are technical challenges and limitation in acquiring X-ray images and determining the presence of foreign materials. In particular Small-sized or low-density foreign materials may not be visible even when X-ray equipment is used, and noise can also make it difficult to detect foreign objects. Moreover, in order to meet the manufacturing speed requirement, the x-ray acquisition time should be reduced, which can result in the very low signal- to-noise ratio(SNR) lowering the foreign material detection accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a five-step approach to overcome the limitations of low resolution, which make it challenging to detect foreign substances. Firstly, global contrast of X-ray images are increased through histogram stretching methodology. Second, to strengthen the high frequency signal and local contrast, we applied local contrast enhancement technique. Third, to improve the edge clearness, Unsharp masking is applied to enhance edges, making objects more visible. Forth, the super-resolution method of the Residual Dense Block (RDB) is used for noise reduction and image enhancement. Last, the Yolov5 algorithm is employed to train and detect foreign objects after learning. Using the proposed method in this study, experimental results show an improvement of more than 10% in performance metrics such as precision compared to low-density images."

Evaluating the efficacy of facial vitiligo treatment typically relies on subjective assessments, such as the Facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI), which can be time-consuming and subjective due to its reliance on clinical observations like lesion shape and distribution. Various machine learning and deep learning methods have been proposed for segmenting vitiligo areas in facial images, showing promising results.

We constructed a corpus for AI training and testing. First, we selected 740 papers related to HMF and diseases randomly from PubMed using an HMF dictionary and a disease terminology dictionary. Experts in KM annotated the evidence levels to build the corpus. The distribution of evidence levels in the corpus was identified as follows: In-vivo Studies (61.22%), Randomized Control Trials (8.65%), and In-vitro Studies (7.84%). We fine-tuned BERT-based models with the built corpus to create a model that determines the evidence levels of a given paper. By evaluating the performance of four fine-tuned models, we found that SciBERT demonstrated the best performance with 94.59% (micro-F1), 89.11% (macro-F1), and 94.38% (weighted-F1)."

A variety of conventional LBP management strategies have been used broadly to improve in patients with LBP. This study designed to compare the therapeutic effects of artificial intelligence–based self-back management with application physical therapy (APT) and conventional physical therapy (CPT) on low back pain intensity, respiratory function, limited functional disability, and quality of life in 100 participants with LBP. A convenience sample of 100 participants (mean age 35.5 ± 8.8 years; 20 females) was participated and underwent either APT or CPT for 30 min per sessions, three times a week over a 4-week period. Statistical analyses comprised analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine intervention-related changes in these outcome measurements. ANOVA revealed a positive effect on therapeutic outcome measures after 8 weeks of both APT and CPT. In conclusion, APT was a successful intervention for clinical outcome variables (Oswestry disability index, Roland-Morris disability questionnaire, Numeric pain rating scale, maximum respiratory pressure, and quality of life. This research compared the effects of APT and CPT in participants with LBP. We demonstrated that APT could afford superior improvements in pain, disabilioty and respiratory strength as well as quality of life than CPT in participants with low back pain."

GCP chip은 항공정사영상에서 추출한 높이 정보가 포함된 작은 영상 패치(patch)이다. 많은 선행연구에서는 영역 기반 정합 기법을 사용하여 고해상도 위성영상과 GCP chip 간 정합을 수행하였다. 계절적 차이나 변화된 지역이 존재하는 영상에서는 화소값에 의존하는 정합이 어렵기 때문에 윤곽 정보를 추출하여 정합을 수행하기도 한다. 그러나 일반적으로 사용하는 canny 기법으로 정합에 용이한 윤곽을 추출하기 위해서는 위성영상의 분광 특성에 적절한 임계치를 설정해주어야 하는 문제가 존재한다. 따라서 본 연구에서는 위성영상의 지역별 특성에 둔감한 윤곽 정보를 활용하여 RPC 보정을 위한 정합을 수행하고자 한다. 이를 위해 딥러닝 기반 윤곽 정보 추출 네트워크인 pixel difference network (PiDiNet)를 활용하여 위성영상과 GCP chip의 윤곽맵(edge map)을 각각 생성하였다. 그 후 생성된 윤곽맵을 normalized cross-correlation과 relative edge cross-correlation의 입력데이터로 대체하여 영역 기반의 정합을 수행하였다. 마지막으로 RPC 보정에 필요한 변환모델 계수를 도출하기 위하여 data snooping 기법을 반복적으로 적용하여 참정합쌍을 추출하였다. 오정합쌍을 제거한 참정합쌍에 대해 root mean square error (RMSE)를 도출하고 기존에 사용하던 상관관계 기법과 결과를 정성적으로 비교하였다. 실험 결과, PiDiNet은 약 0.3~0.9 화소의 RMSE 값 분포를 보였으나 canny 기법에 비해 두꺼운 윤곽을 나타내어 일부 영상에서 미세하게 정확도가 저하되는 것을 확인하였다. 그러나 위성영상 내 특징적인 윤곽을 일관적으로 나타냄으로써 정합이 어려운 지역에서도 정합이 잘 수행되는 것을 확인하였다. 본 연구를 통해 윤곽 기반 정합 기법의 강인성을 개선하여 다양한 지역에서의 정합을 수행할 수 있을 것으로 예상된다.","Most very high-resolution (VHR) satellite images provide rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) data to facilitate the transformation between ground coordinates and image coordinates. However, initial RPC often contains geometric errors, necessitating correction through matching with ground control points (GCPs). A GCP chip is a small image patch extracted from an orthorectified image together with height information of the center point, which can be directly used for geometric correction. Many studies have focused on area-based matching methods to accurately align GCP chips with VHR satellite images. In cases with seasonal differences or changed areas, edge-based algorithms are often used for matching due to the difficulty of relying solely on pixel values. However, traditional edge extraction algorithms,such as canny edge detectors, require appropriate threshold settings tailored to the spectral characteristics of satellite images. Therefore, this study utilizes deep learning-based edge information that is insensitive to the regional characteristics of satellite images for matching. Specifically,we use a pretrained pixel difference network (PiDiNet) to generate the edge maps for both satellite images and GCP chips. These edge maps are then used as input for normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and relative edge cross-correlation (RECC) to identify the peak points with the highest correlation between the two edge maps. To remove mismatched pairs and thus obtain the bias-compensated RPC, we iteratively apply the data snooping. Finally, we compare the results qualitatively and quantitatively with those obtained from traditional NCC and RECC methods. The PiDiNet network approach achieved high matching accuracy with root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 pixels. However, the PiDiNet-generated edges were thicker compared to those from the canny method, leading to slightly lower registration accuracy in some images. Nevertheless, PiDiNet consistently produced characteristic edge information, allowing for successful matching even in challenging regions. This study demonstrates that improving the robustness of edge-based registration methods can facilitate effective registration across diverse regions."

This study aims to analyze discontinuities in government budget proposals from a project-centric perspective, utilizing unstructured data.We hypothesized that if the project composition in a government budget mirrors its size, a defined causal relationship between budget size changes and project content alterations would exist. To test this, we examined the changes in budget size and project content from 2017 to 2018, using growth rates and a deep learning model for quantification, respectively. Our analysis across programs, fields, sectors, and accounting types revealed that about 80% of changes in budget size align with project composition shifts, while the remaining 20% showed changes in only one dimension.This indicates that the traditional aggregate-focused regression discontinuity approach may not fully capture internal changes, suggesting limitations in context comprehension even when detailed budget information is available."

Temperatures of oriental melon and canopy were extracted from thermal images. Differences between extracted temperatures according to weather conditions were then determined. It was found that thermal images acquired after 14:00 were suitable for stable recognition of oriental melon regardless of weather conditions.

To address these issues, recent studies focus on accurately detecting even small-scale fires using multi-sensor and deeplearning technologies.

The primary motion performance and wave load values were determined using pitch, roll, and vertical wave bending moments. The analysis results were then compared to those of the design loads. The analysis results of pitch and roll showed lower values than the design loads, but the vertical wave bending moment showed similar results to the design load. In addition, the motion performance and wave loads were predicted using a deep learning model. Dataset used in deep learning model was constructed considering various environmental conditions, and the 6 degrees of freedom motion responses and vertical wave bending moments of fishing vessel were predicted using the trained deep learning model. The predicted values by the established deep learning model were in good agreement with the analysis results with high accuracy. The challenges of high analysis skills, time, and expense for the evaluation of fishing vessel design loads may be addressed by the proven deep learning approaches. In addition, this study aim to increase the applicability of established deep learning model by considering various fishing vessels and design conditions through additional research in the future."

Enhancing not just the inherent model performance but also accounting for model characteristics and preprocessing data are crucial elements for precise dam inflow prediction. Particularly, existing rainfall data, derived from snowfall amounts through heating facilities, introduces distortions in the correlation between snow accumulation and rainfall, especially in dam basins influenced by snow accumulation, such as Soyang Dam. This study focuses on the preprocessing of rainfall data essential for the application of ML&DL models in predicting dam inflow in basins affected by snow accumulation. This is vital to address phenomena like reduced outflow during winter due to low snowfall and increased outflow during spring despite minimal or no rain, both of which are physical occurrences. Three machine learning models (SVM, RF, LGBM) and two deep learning models (LSTM, TCN) were built by combining rainfall and inflow series. With optimal hyperparameter tuning, the appropriate model was selected, resulting in a high level of predictive performance with NSE ranging from 0.842 to 0.894. Moreover, to generate rainfall correction data considering snow accumulation, a simulated snow accumulation algorithm was developed. Applying this correction to machine learning and deep learning models yielded NSE values ranging from 0.841 to 0.896, indicating a similarly high level of predictive performance compared to the pre-snow accumulation application. Notably, during the snow accumulation period, adjusting rainfall during the training phase was observed to lead to a more accurate simulation of observed inflow when predicted. This underscores the importance of thoughtful data preprocessing, taking into account physical factors such as snowfall and snowmelt, in constructing data models."

To achieve, we analyzed whether there were differences in reporting by political orientation with an artificial neural network-based deep learning model, examined the distribution of newspapers by measuring similarity with Doc2Vec, and analyzed the difference in reporting tendency according to political orientation with sentiment analysis. As a result, first, the deep learning model was able to classify ‘progressive-moderate-conservative’ with an accuracy of 89.8%, and in binary classification between progressive-oriented newspapers and newspapers of other orientations, an accuracy of over 93% was achieved, indicating that differences in coverage depending on political orientation could be identified. Second, Doc2Vec analysis revealed that except for the progressive media Kyunghyang and Hankyoreh, and the conservative media Munhwa-Ilbo and Chosun-Ilbo, the other newspapers had high similarity with moderate-oriented newspapers. Third, sentiment analysis showed that progressive media tended to use more negative terms in coverage on the 20th presidential election, but no newspaper showed a difference in the intensity of positive/negative reports according to candidates. In conclusion, this study confirmed that there are differences according to the political orientations of 'progressive-moderate-conservative' in the coverage of the 20th presidential election by major newspapers, and that the coverage terrainins centered around moderate-oriented media."

These incidents display a global upward trend, with significant societal and economic repercussions. To mitigate road accidents, primarily caused by driver negligence, systems leveraging deep learning and machine learning are being developed. Previous research has predominantly focused on models based on driver images for detecting abnormal driving behavior, with a predominant emphasis on convolutional models. Convolutional models learn specific patterns and features from images during the initial stages of training, extracting them using fixed-size filters, thereby limiting adaptability to diverse driving scenarios.

Various deep learning models have been developed to help TOF-MRA reading in the field. The performance of those TOF-MRA analysis tools, however, faces several limitations in cerebral aneurysm detection. These challenges primarily come from the fact that cerebral aneurysms occupy less than 0.1% of the total TOF-MRA voxel size. This study aims to improve the efficiency of cerebral aneurysm detection by developing a landmark-based semi-supervised deep learning method, a technology that automatically generates landmark boxes in areas with a high probability of cerebral aneurysm occurrence.Methods: We used data from a total of 500 aneurysm-positive and 50 aneurysm-negative subjects. The aneurysm detection model was developed using clustering and a dilated residual network.Results: When the number of landmarks was ten and their size was 36 mm3, the best performance was achieved in our experiment. Although landmark occupies a small portion of the entire image, up to 98.2% of landmarks were cerebral aneurysms.

A model for judging the similarity of show gardens based on VGG-16 and ResNet50 models was developed, and was referred to as DRG (Deep Recognition of similarity in show Garden design). An algorithm utilizing GAP and Pearson correlation coefficient was employed to construct the model, and the accuracy of similarity was analyzed by comparing the total number of similar images derived at 1st (Top1), 3rd (Top3), and 5th (Top5) ranks with the original images. The image data used for the DRG model consisted of a total of 278 works from the Le Festival International des Jardins de Chaumont-sur-Loire, 27 works from the Seoul International Garden Show, and 17 works from the Korea Garden Show. Image analysis was conducted using the DRG model for both the same group and different groups, resulting in the establishment of guidelines for assessing show garden similarity. First, overall image similarity analysis was best suited for applying data augmentation techniques based on the ResNet50 model. Second, for image analysis focusing on internal structure and outer form, it was effective to apply a certain size filter (16cm × 16cm) to generate images emphasizing form and then compare similarity using the VGG-16 model. It was suggested that an image size of 448 × 448 pixels and the original image in full color are the optimal settings. Based on these research findings, a quantitative method for assessing show gardens is proposed and it is expected to contribute to the continuous development of garden culture through interdisciplinary research moving forward."

Images were obtained using various reconstruction techniques (FBP, IR, DLR, and UHR-DLR) for each CT manufacturer. Stent clarity was evaluated using edge rise distance (ERD) and edge rise slope (ERS).

To facilitate early detection, deep learning (DL) models were developed to classify osteoporosis using abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans. This study was conducted using retrospectively collected data from 3,012 contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans. The DL models developed in this study were constructed for using image data, demographic/clinical information, and multi-modality data, respectively.Patients were categorized into the normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis groups based on their T-scores, obtained from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, into normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis groups. The models showed high accuracy and effectiveness, with the combined data model performing the best, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 and an accuracy of 0.80. The image-based model also performed well, while the demographic data model had lower accuracy and effectiveness. In addition, the DL model was interpreted by gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to highlight clinically relevant features in the images, revealing the femoral neck as a common site for fractures. The study shows that DL can accurately identify osteoporosis stages from clinical data, indicating the potential of abdominal CT scans in early osteoporosis detection and reducing fracture risks with prompt treatment."

With 3D Vertical SONOS NAND, it is possible to stack many transistors on a limited-size wafer to secure more memory capacity than the planar type. However, with the change to the vertical structure, the cost of the process has increased along with the increase in process difficulty. Therefore, there is a need for a technology that reduces the process's cost and predicts the device's electrical characteristics quickly and accurately.

A virtual environment modeled after the underground utility tunnel located in Ochang, Chungcheongbuk-do is constructed to collect fire data using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) software. In the experiment, we compared the proposed model to other time-series anomaly detection models and evalutated its predictive performance. The results show that the precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score of ConvLSTM-VAE are 0.881579, 0.99505, 0.930693, and 0.934884, respectively, and far superior to other models in terms of its predictive performance."

To address this limitation, this research compares the performance of two deep learning models, MeshSegNet and DilatedToothSegNet, for tooth-numbered 3D segmentation. The models were trained with mesh cell resolutions of 10,000 and 16,000 to assess accuracy at different levels. Evaluation metrics, including Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), were used to measure performance. Results showed that the DilatedToothSegNet model with 16,000 cells outperformed MeshSegNet, achieving a 2.2–3.5% improvement in both DSC and mIoU metrics for maxillary and mandibular data.

Patients diagnosed with circadian sleep disorders, narcolepsy, or periodic limb movement disorders were excluded. From the actigraphy data, three types of data were selected from the first 5 days, namely, sleep-wake status, activity count, and light exposure per epoch. The data were processed into a two-dimensional array with four instances, namely, 24-hour full-day data and data for 6, 8, and 10 hours timepoints after sleep onset, and then analyzed. Using a CNN, we attempted to classify the processed data into PSG-based diagnoses.Results: Overfitting of the training data was observed. The CNN showed near-perfect accuracy on the test data, but failed to classify the validation data (area under the curve: 24-hour full-day data: 0.6031, 6 hours after sleep onset: 0.5148, 8 hours: 0.6122, and 10 hours: 0.5769).Conclusions: The lack and inaccuracy of data were responsible for the results. A higher sampling rate and additional ancillary data, such as PSG or heart rate variability data, are necessary for accurate classification. Additionally, alternative approaches to machine learning, such as transformers, should be considered in future studies."

In the future, new technologies and methods will be developed, and more advanced image processing technologies are expected to be realized. Summarizes the latest trends in facial recognition technology regulation.Moves to regulate facial recognition technology have accelerated in Europe and the United States in recent years. In particular, the United States, which has major IT companies, is a world leader in facial recognition technology research and development, and research on the impact of facial recognition technology on society has been conducted from a relatively early stage. These research reports have raised concerns that the facial recognition system may become a surveillance society and strengthen structural discrimination, and human rights protection groups have targeted private companies developing facial recognition technology and public institutions that have adopted this technology to use facial recognition. We are actively campaigning to ban it. Looking at the ordinance enactment process enacted in various places from 2019 to 2020, there are several effects of this movement. Additionally, efforts to enact legislation regulating facial recognition technology have been rapidly expanding following the May 2020 death of George Floyd, an African-American man who died after a white police officer squeezed his neck.While interest in regulating facial recognition technology is growing in Europe and the United States, the situation in our country is difficult to formulate government guidelines for some use cases (e.g., guidebook on handling personal data of One ID service using facial recognition technology at airports). It is undeniable that it is limited and that each country is ‘lagging behind’. According to a report by the AI ​​Now Institute, a research institute at New York University, “Recent laws address traditional data privacy and security issues and how these systems are used. Liability issues, such as who is responsible if these systems are compromised, are being addressed and the focus is shifting from data to systems.” In other words, when considering the laws and regulations of facial recognition technology, it is important to have a comprehensive view of the entire system.In keeping with the development of science and technology, the question of who will form rules, how, and through what discussions, is not limited to facial recognition technology. For example, with regard to nanomaterials, it is said that sufficient scientific knowledge is not available regarding their effects on the environment and the human body, but preventive measures are being taken mainly in Europe and the United States. According to traditional constitutional theory, restricting individual rights and freedoms requires a basis of law, and law requires social, economic, political, and scientific facts to support its necessity and rationality. However, if we wait until the risks of cutting-edge technology, which involve scientific uncertainty, are clarified before taking action, the damage and harm could far exceed expectations, and the country, which must protect the lives and rights of its citizens, cannot respond in such a way. In these cases, when the precautionary principle is applied, emphasizing the preventive aspect, the state must ensure that no harm or incident has occurred in a sufficiently tangible way to justify the need for regulation of the technology, or that there is scientific knowledge and social consensus to justify regulation. In a situation where we cannot obtain it, we must legislate and make policy decisions."

This is a very complex and challenging problem because it consists of a large number of multi-layered and multi-element systems with a huge search space. Evolutionary computation is widely used for large-scale optimization problems due to its high efficiency, but it is difficult to apply due to the characteristics of evolutionary computation when the calculation of the fitness function is complex.

Our study fills this gap by investigating the economic effects of walkable environments at different scales on commercial property values in Seoul, Korea. This study specifies walkable environments into macro-, meso-, and micro-scale and uses a computer vision technique to estimate streetscape features surrounding commercial properties. Based on these estimations, we employed various machine learning algorithms to produce optimal automated valuation models for the economic effects of walkable environments on commercial property values. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence methods were used to identify variables that contributed the most to the black box models and to explore the non-linear relationships between walkable environments and commercial property values. Furthermore, our research demonstrated how the economic effects of walkable environments vary across submarkets classified by living population density. Our results indicate that various scales of walkability influence commercial property values, and these impacts differ according to submarkets. The findings of this study provide helpful insight into how to increase the economic benefits of commercial properties by creating walkable environments. Lastly, this study suggests practical approaches to explain the black box models with greater interpretability and transparency."

The accuracyand reliability of AI model-based land cover maps increase with the amount oftraining data, but it is difficult to acquire large amounts of data due to the timerequired for label data annotation. In South Korea, the Environmental GeographicInformation Service provides self-learning data consisting of aerial orthoimages andsubdivision land cover classification level label data, making it possible to collecthigh-quality data. Therefore, this study examined the feasibility of self-learningdata by building and evaluating a U-Net-based land cover classification model forwaterfront areas using self-learning data. The trained model showed relativelylow performance with an F-1 score of 0.61 for training data and 0.31 for test data.The model’s low performance is thought to be due to insufficient training causedby the large number of classification categories (34) and data imbalance betweencategories. Although the model performance using self-learning data was low, itis believed that model performance can be improved by grouping classificationcategories according to research purposes or resolving data imbalance through dataaugmentation techniques.

However, in addition to the target's echo, the active sonar's received signal is mixed with seafloor, sea surface reverberation, biological noise, and other noise, making target recognition difficult. Conventional techniques for detecting signals above a threshold not only cause false detections or miss targets depending on the set threshold, but also have the problem of having to set an appropriate threshold for various underwater environments. To overcome this, research has been conducted on automatic calculation of threshold values through techniques such as Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) and application of advanced tracking filters and association techniques, but there are limitations in environments where a significant number of detections occur. As deep learning technology has recently developed, efforts have been made to apply it in the field of underwater target detection, but it is very difficult to acquire active sonar data for discriminator learning, so not only is the data rare, but there are only a very small number of targets and a relatively large number of non-targets. There are difficulties due to the imbalance of data. In this paper, the image of the energy distribution of the detection signal is used, and a classifier is learned in a way that takes into account the imbalance of the data to distinguish between targets and non-targets and added to the existing technique. Through the proposed technique, target misclassification was minimized and non-targets were eliminated, making target recognition easier for active sonar operators.

There is a demand for techniques that can accurately detect flame or smoke areas in fire images due to the uncertainty of complex backgrounds and environmental factors. In this paper, to accurately detect fire areas, we propose a method that seamlessly combines attent ion mechanisms and scale-invariant Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network(BiFPN) structures to separate object and background information while maintaining their correlations. It removes unnecessary information and emphasizes only the necessary information to maintain consistent accuracy in flame and smoke areas regardless of their sizes.

However, collisions between ships and these aids result in substantial costs for buoy damage and repair. While high-end equipment is currently used to prevent such accidents, its widespread adoption is hindered by cost concerns. This paper presents research on a maritime object detection algorithm utilizing embedded systems to address this issue. Previous studies employed the Hough transform for horizon detection, but its high computational demands posed challenges for real-time processing. To overcome this limitation, our approach first performs image segmentation, followed by an optimized Otsu algorithm for horizon detection. Subsequently, we establish a Region of Interest (ROI) based on the detected horizon, focusing on areas with a high risk of ship collision. Within this ROI, particularly below the horizon line, maritime objects are detected. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is then applied to determine whether the detected objects are ships. Objects classified as ships within the ROI are considered potential collision risks."

As a result of detecting objects through the YOLO algorithm, buildings showed a performance of detecting objects corresponding to 96.3% of the buildings provided in the existing digital map. In addition, the YOLO algorithm developed in this study detected 136 additional buildings that were not located in the digital map. Plastic greenhouses detected a total of 297 objects, but the detection rate was low for some plastic greenhouses for fruit trees. Also, agricultural land had the lowest detection rate. This result is because agricultural land has a larger area and irregular shape than buildings, so the accuracy is lower than buildings due to the inconsistency of training data. Therefore, segmentation detection, rather than box-shaped detection, is likely to be more effective for agricultural fields. Comparing the detected objects with the land category by law, it was analyzed that some buildings exist in agricultural and forest areas where it is difficult to locate buildings. It seems that it is necessary to link with administrative information to understand that these buildings are used illegally. Therefore, at the current level, it is possible to objectively determine the existence of buildings in fields where it is difficult to locate buildings."

Previous research on streetscapes and park visits has predominantly relied on surveys, which are limited by respondents’ subjective perceptions. Thus, there is a need for research that quantitatively analyzes streetscape quality and its effect on park visits. In this study, we conducted a multiple regression analysis, with the number of park visitors as the dependent variable and quantified streetscape as the independent variable. Streetscape was measured using Google Street View panorama images and the DeepLabV3+ model to calculate the proportion of vegetation, sky and sidewalks within the pictures. The analysis focused on children’s parks in Seoul, located within walking distance of residential areas, from March to May 2018. The results reveal that streetscape characteristics play a significant role in explaining park visits. A larger sky-view ratio positively influences park visits by encouraging pedestrian movement and providing psychological comfort. Additionally, sidewalks along park boundaries enhance safety, thereby promoting park visits. Furthermore, a wide road along the park boundary is associated with an increased likelihood of park visits due to enhanced park visibility and passersby accessibility. These findings provide valuable insights into user preferences within streetscapes and offer policy implications for expanding the utilization of urban parks."

It is nearly impossible to accurately perceive an unstructured environment for online autonomous driving, and real-time operation heavily depends on computational power.

Collective navigation in complex environments is essential for various applications such as search and rescue, environment monitoring and military tasks operations. Conventional methods, which are easily interpretable from an engineering perspective, divide the navigation tasks into mapping, planning, and control; however, they struggle with increased latency and unmodeled environmental factors. Recently, learning-based methods have addressed these problems by employing the end-to-end framework with neural networks. Nonetheless, most existing learning-based approaches face challenges in complex scenarios particularly for navigating through a narrow gap or when a leader or informed UAV is unavailable. Our approach uses the information of a certain number of nearest neighboring UAVs and incorporates a task-specific curriculum to reduce learning time and train a robust model. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through an ablation study and quantitative metrics. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods."

At first, for inferring the position of the object, pre-collected raw images and the exact position of the object are used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Position Extractor, which is based on the feature extraction part of pre-trained VGG16. Then, reinforcement learning methods such as Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) along with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) are used to train a robot arm to move the object to a desired position in the simulation environment. A big advantage of this methodology is that an extra sensor for tracking the exact position of the object in real-time is not needed, since raw images are used to infer the position of the object and the robot arm uses that inferred position to move the object to the desired location. The mean cumulative rewards and the success rate of the methodology proposed by this paper are –48.51 and 95.0% respectively.

In the food manufacturing industry, maintaining and improving product quality continuously is crucial. However, quality management faces numerous challenges owing to the complex manufacturing processes and variables such as diverse raw materials and environmental conditions. Traditional quality management methods have limitations because they mainly rely on empirical data and are often restricted to analyzing quality conditions at specific points in time, making it difficult to predict or prevent issues in real time. To address these limitations, this study introduces a quality analysis and prediction system based on a generative model and reinforcement learning. The system generates quality-related data using the generative model, and employs the reinforcement learning model to analyze in real time the variety of data generated about quality during the manufacturing process. By inputting data collected in real time into a reinforcement learning model, the system can predict the final quality of the product. Moreover, by learning the impact on quality from changes in specific variables, the system can identify and prevent potential defects before they occur. This study enhances deep learning in food manufacturing and introduces new quality control methods."

Our study addresses this challenge by proposing an on-device AI-based real-time machine fault diagnosis system that utilizes continual learning. Our proposed system includes a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model, a continual learning algorithm, and a real-time monitoring service. First, we developed a lightweight 1D CNN model to reduce the cost of model deployment and enable real-time inference on the target edge device with limited computing resources. We then compared the performance of five continual learning algorithms with three public bearing fault datasets and selected the most effective algorithm for our system. Finally, we implemented a real-time monitoring service using an open-source data visualization framework. In the performance comparison results between continual learning algorithms, we found that the replay-based algorithms outperformed the regularization-based algorithms, and the experience replay (ER) algorithm had the best diagnostic accuracy. We further tuned the number and length of data samples used for a memory buffer of the ER algorithm to maximize its performance. We confirmed that the performance of the ER algorithm becomes higher when a longer data length is used. Consequently, the proposed system showed an accuracy of 98.7%, while only 16.5% of the previous data was stored in memory buffer. Our lightweight CNN model was also able to diagnose a fault type of one data sample within 3.76 ms on the Raspberry Pi 4B device."

Accordingly, multimodal approaches have recently received attention, and research on emotion recognition using these approaches is actively underway. The multimodal approach uses ensemble techniques that average or weight model predictions to predict the final result. However, if one modality shows relatively low performance, it can limit the performance of the entire model. Therefore, to improve the performance of multimodal emotion recognition, it is necessary to enhance the performance of individual modalities. In this paper, we propose a speech data adaptive emotion recognition model using progressive transfer learning by applying domain adaptation techniques. After initially training the designed deep learning model with text data, the fixed weights are progressively reduced and retrained with voice data to effectively combine the characteristics of text and voice for speech emotion recognition. Experimental results confirm that this approach achieves higher performance than models trained solely on voice data and models using general transfer learning. This methodology is expected to contribute to improving multimodal emotion recognition performance and enhancing interaction in non-face-to-face environments."

Meta Pseudo Count 방법론은, 레이블이 없는 데이터에 대해 Pseudo Count를 생성하고, 이를 이용하여 Teacher 모델이 Student 모델을 학습시킨다. 기존의 지도학습 모델에 레이블이 없는 데이터를 추가로 학습하였을 때, Meta Pseudo Count 방식은 예측의 정확도가 준지도 학습 모델의 장점을 보여주며, 레이블이 없는 데이터를 활용하여 학습 모델의 일반화 능력이 향상되었다.","The technology of Crowd density estimation, which ensures the safety of densely populated areas, utilizes intelligent video analysis techniques based on deep learning. Semi-supervised learning methods have gained attention in the field of crowd density analysis to address the challenges of labeling costs and labor. Crowd density estimation is a important research topic applied in various areas such as traffic management and safety surveillance, often using CNN-based models to build prediction models. Labeling tasks are costly and labor-intensive, and in real fields, the amount of unlabeled data outweighs the labeled data. In this paper, a semi-supervised learning method called Meta Pseudo Count (MPC) is proposed for crowd density estimation. The Meta Pseudo Count methodology generates pseudo counts for unlabeled data and uses them to train a Teacher model to educate a Student model. When unlabeled data is added to conventional supervised learning models, the Meta Pseudo Count approach demonstrates the accuracy of predictions, showing the advantages of semi-supervised learning models. It also enhances the generalization ability of the trained model by utilizing unlabeled data for learning."

This process of standardizing and combining rewards can be tricky though, as we might lose the unique aspects of each reward function  and struggle to figure out the right weights for each one. We tackle this challenge by proposing a new way to handle multiple rewards in reinforcement learning: instead of mixing everything together, we let the system learn about different types of rewards separately. Our approach uses what we call a Multi Critic network structure in Actor-Critic algorithms, where multiple Critic networks each focus on learning about different reward elements. This setup allows the Actor network policy to be evaluated from multiple angles. To validate our idea, we applied it to recommender systems, which naturally need to balance various types of rewards. We treated the recommendation process as a sequential decision-makings and used DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) to handle the large action space typical in recommendation problems. As results, we show that Multi Critic model with multiple learning passes performed better than both traditional Single Critic models and other recommendation systems."

The Joseon dynasty was founded in 1392 with the Neo-Confucian ideals and doctrines as the state ideology. In particular, Zhu Xi’s Neo-Confucianism remained a central subject of scholarly inquiry and practice for Joseon scholars until the end of the dynasty. By the 17th century, the understanding of Zhu Xi’s Neo-Confucianism had deepened. Within this context, the Great Learning became a fundamental text for scholarly inquiry, and especially the system of Commentaries on the Daxue (Daxue Zhangju, 大學章句) edited by Zhu Xi became a significant area of research. However, existing research tended to focus on interpretations by specific figures like Jeong Yak-yong and Jeong Je-du, who deviated from Zhu Xi’s views. This approach suggests that the scholarship of 18th century Joseon attempted to overcome Zhu Xi’s teachings and explore new academic frontiers. While such a perspective is crucial for understanding the 18th century, it alone does not fully capture the richness of Joseon’s scholarly landscape at the time.The interpretation of the Great Learning in 18th century Joseon needs to encompass not only the previously focused areas such as “practical learning”, “Yangmingism”, and “disciplines of kingship” but also include the broader context of Zhu Xi’s Neo-Confucianism. This paper will examine five key questions: What sources were consulted? How were the discussions framed? What themes were addressed? Where were the theories applied? What are the distinctive features of Joseon scholars’ interpretations in East Asia? It will characterize the 18th-century Joseon interpretation of the Great Learning through emerging scholarly perspectives, diversification with regard to the trend of writings, enrichment of textual debates, and the appearance of related works like Lectures on Classics and History (經史講議) and ultimately, compare these aspects in the context of East Asia. This period was the pinnacle of Neo-Confucianism in Joseon, a time when deep philosophical insights emerged, which also marked the beginning of new ideological movements.Through this research, the scholarly interests and achievements of Joseon scholars regarding the Great Learning will be objectively assessed to establish a foundation for the history of Joseon scholarship, and ultimately, to position the scholarship of 18th century Joseon within the history of East Asian thoughts. It is hoped that this exploration and proposal will contribute significantly to clarifying the true landscape of Korea’s scholarly history."

First of all, RGB image data of chestnuts treated using 51 two-knife peeling process conditions were acquired. The developed model was constructed with two stages of K-means clustering and ranking systems. The Jaccard similarity index for a performance evaluation of the models was calculated. The first clustering stage was a process of separating the chestnut and background from the original image. The average Jaccard similarity index of the first clustering step was 0.92. The second clustering step was the division process of the peeled chestnut into three regions (outer shell, inner shell, and kernel). The percentage of each region was derived by dividing the number of pixels in each region by the total number of pixels in the image. The Jaccard similarity indices of the outer shell, inner shell, and kernel were 0.96, 0.88, and 0.74, respectively. As a result, machine learning-based clustering with a ranking system was proposed to analyze whether the peeling rate affects the improvement of the peel efficiency and production efficiency in the domestic chestnut industry."

This paper presents a novel algorithm for reconstructing an ad-hoc network using UAVs, specifically addressing scenarios involving malfunctioning relay nodes that hinder the delivery of source data to the intended destination. To overcome the challenges associated with decentralized control, an autonomous decision-making solution is proposed for UAVs based on deep reinforcement learning. Furthermore, curriculum learning and recurrent neural networks are employed to tackle issues related to sparse and delayed rewards. To enhance practicality, the algorithm enables UAVs to make decisions based on partial and incomplete information about the surrounding environment.

In the past, predictions were based on human experience, but modern methods involve developing predictive models. These models offer advantages such as reduced time and resource consumption compared to traditional methods. However, practical implementation remains limited due to various challenges. This paper utilizes cafeteria data from 2018, 2019, and 2023 semesters, along with weather data from the Korea Meteorological Administration, to select variables through EDA analysis.Using these variables and machine learning algorithms, models were developed to predict breakfast, lunch, and dinner attendance. The best-performing model was selected as the final model to develop a prediction program. 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for validation. The final models selected were XGBoost for breakfast (MAE ratio 12.97%) and RandomForest for lunch and dinner (MAE ratios 4.8% and 4.93%, respectively). The lunch and dinner prediction models demonstrated good performance. Future work will involve continuous data collection, adding new derived variables, hyperparameter tuning, and UI improvements to enhance model performance and convenience."

Traditionally, collaborative filtering has been widely used as a methodology to implement recommendation systems, and more recently, reinforcement learning techniques have been frequently attempted. However, existing approaches based on collaborative filtering or deep reinforcement learning have limitations in accurately reflecting the complexity of user behavior and multidimensional preferences, resulting in reduced recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel travel recommendation system that combines relational graph networks with reinforcement learning. Specifically, the study models the complex interactions between users and destinations as a graph structure, and by inputting high-dimensional embeddings generated from the Relational Graph Attention Network (RGAT) into the reinforcement learning algorithm APEX-DQN, it recommends optimal travel destinations. The proposed system demonstrates a superior ability to capture complex user behavior patterns and unstructured data, which traditional models struggle to process effectively. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing CF (User-based), CF (POI-based), GMF, MLP, and GAT models in terms of RMSE and MAE metrics.

In particular, generative AI, based on very large language models, is capable of producing more human-like responses to a given prompt than ever before. This is accelerated by the fact that AI is becoming more accessible to the general public rather than to specialized groups. The creative use of AI that occurred in 2021 with the emergence of SIA, a poetry-writing AI, was popularized in 2023 when ChatGPT began to be used in earnest.Particularly in 2023, this development of generative AI was accompanied by a variety of academic debates in engineering, education, sociology, and aesthetics about the possibilities of using ChatGPT. However, unlike the pre-training model of GPT-3, the previous model, the pre-training model of GPT-4, the model of ChatGPT has not yet been released, which imposes many restrictions on the use of ChatGPT.Generative AI that cannot be pre-trained has very limited information input from users, and the information input cannot be stored permanently, making it difficult to function as a practical tool. In this situation, I was interested in the in-context learning and prompt sharing features that ChatGPT uses to understand context and provide natural answers. ChatGPT can remember up to 4,096 tokens of input prompts and share the context with others to continue the question, so it can be used as a teaching tool to a limited extent.The amount of information that generative AI can remember is constantly increasing, and the processing speed is also increasing by leaps and bounds, according to the current trend of technology development from GPT-1 to GPT-4. Under these circumstances, an approach to the educational use of generative AI should not only focus on the capabilities available today, but also include a discussion of the possibilities for future applications of generative AI.In this paper, we design a literature lesson plan based on the in-context learning capabilities of generative AI, but include a discussion of its practical limitations and future improvements. We summarize the results of using the textbook in real classrooms, analyze whether it can replace traditional textbooks, and if not, what the difficulties are, and identify ways to compensate for the problems found."

Traditional machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, TPOP, XGBoost) and deep learning techniques (LSTM, GRU, SimpleRNN) were employed, along with ensemble methods like Stacking Classifier. Data was collected and split into an 80:20 ratio for training and testing, with hyperparameters optimized using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV. The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. As a result of the study, tree-based models (Random Forest, TPOP) demonstrated high performance (accuracy 0.93, F1-score 0.95), while deep learning models showed moderate performance, with GRU slightly outperforming LSTM (F1-scores: 0.83 vs. 0.82).

With the advent of deep learning, many new and effective methods have been proposed.

In this work, we propose a method to improve the performance of Single Image Super-Resolution that is robust against various degradation types, without changing the architecture of conventional SR network, by utilizing the internal information. For utilizing the internal information, we adopt a meta-learning algorithms using a meta-learner network, which constructs an pixel-wise adaptive weight map(PAW) tailored to the given input image. This approach can be quickly applied to bicubic downsampling kernels as well as blind downsampling kernels and improves performance by encouraging the network to focus more on complex parts of the image.

Five air quality variables, including NO2, SO2, CO, PM10 and PM2.5, and seven meteorological variables, including temperature, humidity, vapor pressure, wind speed, precipitation, local atmospheric pressure, and sea-level atmosphere pressure, were collected from three air quality monitoring stations and one meteorological observatory from 2017 to 2022. A total of 52,583 sets of data were used for ML. The prediction accuracies of the applied ML models were evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Coefficient of determination (R2).Results and Discussion:Higher ML performance was obtained when using the data including PM10 and PM2.5 compared to the data excluding these variables. Among five different ML models, the XGB model showed the highest accuracy in predicting PM10 and PM2.5 one hour in the future. However, poorer performance was obtained as the predicted period increased from one hour to 72 hours.Conclusion:The application of ML algorithms for the short-term prediction of PM10 and PM2.5 was successful in this study. However, more input variables and deep learning algorithms are needed for long-term prediction of PM10 and PM2.5."

Accurate and reliable cancer diagnosis is a prerequisite for timely management and treatment. In this study, we propose a deep learning method that can conduct colorectal cancer diagnosis on whole slide images obtained from colorectal cancer patients. Previous research on cancer grading primarily focused on categorical classification, which assumes the independence among cancer grades. However, cancer grades indicate how different or close the cancer cells are to normal cells. That is, cancer grades are related to each other. Herein, we propose to define the ordinal relationship among cancer grades and use them to conduct cancer diagnosis. To achieve this, we construct a convolutional neural network that can simultaneously perform both categorical and ordinal classification. The ordinal classification utilizes a pair of an input image and a reference image. Moreover, we introduce a voting mechanism to improve the classification performance. The voting mechanism identifies the input image that is likely to be mis-classified and corrects the classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only accurately conducts cancer grading but also outperforms other competing models. We anticipate that the proposed method can be applied to other types of cancers and disease to improve the quality of diagnosis and patient management."

The hydrodynamic model for the downstream reach of the Han River was calibrated by considering the spatial distribution and temporal variation of Manning’s roughness coefficient in unsteady flow conditions. In the following error correction procedure, the systematic errors of the hydrodynamic model were captured using long short term memory (LSTM) model. To assess the model accuracy, performances of the hydrodynamic model, two LSTM based models (LSTM1 and LSTM2), and the hybrid model were compared.

For untrained flange radii, the spring-back predicted by the DNN exhibited a mean relative error of 2.18% when compared to FEM results. Additionally, while FEM analysis required approximately 20 minutes, the DNN-based prediction required only about 14 milliseconds. These results highlight the potential of using DNNs for the rapid prediction of process-induced deformation in CFRP composites."

An attacker performing an adversarial attack intentionally manipulates the deep learning model by injecting carefully crafted input data, that is, adversarial examples, into the client's training data to induce misclassification. A common defense strategy against this is so-called adversarial training, which involves preemptively learning the characteristics of adversarial examples into the model. Existing research assumes a scenario where all clients are under adversarial attack, but considering the number of clients in federated learning is very large, this is far from reality. In this paper, we experimentally examine aspects of adversarial training in a scenario where some of the clients are under attack. Through experiments, we found that there is a trade-off relationship in which the classification accuracy for normal samples decreases as the classification accuracy for adversarial examples increases. In order to effectively utilize this trade-off relationship, we present a method to perform adversarial training by adaptively selecting a loss function depending on whether the client is attacked."

It aims to closely analyze how the participants cooperate with each other to achieve a common goal, that is, the expression intended by the piece, and enhance the perfection of the performance, and how they adjust the aspects of their own expressions and demonstrate their expertise in the process of this interaction. To this end, the process of rehearsal, rehearsal, and actual performance of an opera performance was recorded, observed, and analyzed through video recording, and the flow of multimodal interaction, including verbal and nonverbal, was analyzed from the perspective of ‘the learning sciences’. ‘The learning sciences’ refers to all studies on the interaction and variation of experience among participants. For the learning sciences analysis, we utilized Ethnomethodology (EM), an embodied phenomenology and micro-sociology of contextual inference and action. EM is a genre of qualitative research that attempts to approach the embodied mind and its expression style through how the interaction between participants works in conjunction with the situational context. Since performance can be seen as an inherent characteristic of one-timeness and on-siteness, we attempted to explore the possibility of this as a research method that systematically analyzes these characteristics of performance. Beyond the text of the piece, I believe it will deepen the insight into the harmonious integration based on creative performance and interaction that is generated in the performance execution. I hope that it will contribute to not only a deep understanding of performance but also an expanded understanding of interaction and participatory practice in a wide range of genres beyond the arts."

In order to minimize the damage caused by hypoxia in aquaculture, it is necessary to build a prediction model that can predict the timing of hypoxia in advance and respond to it early. In this study, recurrent neural network models specialized in time series prediction, Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), Gate Recurrent Unit(GRU), and 1-Dimensional Convolution Neural Network(1D-CNN), a convolutional neural network, were used to predict the variation of bottom dissolved oxygen, and the performance of each model was evaluated. The input data for the deep learning models were layer by layer marine environmental data continuously observed in the Dangdong bay from 2019 to 2022. The 2019 to 2021 data were used as training and validation data for the model, and the 2022 data were predicted and compared and validated with the observed data. Pearson correlation and mutual information(MI) analyses, trial and error methods were performed to select the optimal inputs and parameters that affect the prediction accuracy of the model. The results showed that the GRU model and 1D-CNN model outperformed the LSTM model. The reproducibility of the short-term variation pattern of the LSTM model decreased as the forecast lead time increased, which was attributed to the structure of each model. This study shows that when applying deep learning models to time series forecasting, it is necessary to use models that reflect data characteristics. In the future, if the prediction error of the model is reduced by securing reliable and high-quality inputs and adjusting the parameters, it is expected that improved prediction accuracy and a prediction time of more than 48 hours can be secured."

In this context, photovoltaic power forecasting models based on graph neural networks have been presented, going beyond existing deep learning models. These models enhance prediction accuracy by learning the interactions between regions. Specifically, they consider how the amount of photovoltaic power in a specific region is affected by the climate conditions of adjacent regions and the time pattern of photovoltaic power generation. However, existing models mainly rely on a fixed graph structure, making it difficult to capture temporal and spatial interactions. In this paper, we propose a graph neural networks-based photovoltaic power forecasting scheme that takes into account both long-term and short-term time patterns of regional photovoltaic power generation data. We then incorporate these patterns into the learning process to establish correlations between regions. Compared to other graph neural networks-based prediction models, our proposed scheme achieved a performance improvement of up to 7.49% based on the RRSE, demonstrating its superiority."

In this case, the “becoming of a male child” is embodied in “becoming a mother” within the relationship with the mother. In The House with a Deep Yard, the mother figure appears as a test for the boy to learn the discipline of the “symbolic father.” This mother figure, regardless of whether it is the boy’s biological mother, a neighbor, or a family member, represents an extended mother figure who exemplifies the world in which the ideology of the time operates and provides survival instructions as a patriarch.

Instead of the static pricing policy, the parking lot aims to dynamically control the parking permit price to prevent it from being full and getting too overcrowded. To address this problem, we propose a DQN(Deep Q-Network)-based dynamic pricing model that determines the price for every hour after observing the parking environment such as occupancy and the amount of sold permits. We trained the DQN model with an environment that simulates demands, incoming and outgoing vehicles, parking duration and lead time. Numerical analysis compares the proposed dynamic pricing model with the current static pricing policy. The comparison demonstrates that the dynamic pricing model is effective for reducing the chance of overcrowded and enhancing the profitability."

Because a pre-trained model already learns how to extract the features from previously trained data, it allows for faster and better performance on new datasets compared to models that are initialized randomly. Transfer learning is particularly useful when the quality and quantity of the data to be learned are insufficient.

Measuring the number of apples on anapple tree can be used to predict apple yield and to assess losses for determining agricultural disaster insurancepayouts. To measure apple fruit load, we photographed the front and back sides of apple trees. We manuallylabeled the apples in the captured images to construct a dataset, which was then used to train a one-stage objectdetection CNN model. However, when apples on an apple tree are obscured by leaves, branches, or other parts ofthe tree, they may not be captured in images. Consequently, it becomes difficult for image recognition-based deeplearning models to detect or infer the presence of these apples. To address this issue, we propose a two-stageinference process. In the first stage, we utilize an image-based deep learning model to count the number of applesin photos taken from both sides of the apple tree. In the second stage, we conduct a polynomial regression analysis,using the total apple count from the deep learning model as the independent variable, and the actual number ofapples manually counted during an on-site visit to the orchard as the dependent variable. The performanceevaluation of the two-stage inference system proposed in this paper showed an average accuracy of 90.98% incounting the number of apples on each apple tree. Therefore, the proposed method can significantly reduce thetime and cost associated with manually counting apples. Furthermore, this approach has the potential to be widelyadopted as a new foundational technology for fruit load estimation in related fields using deep learning."

WAVE 통신 시스템에서 LSTM 기반 저복잡도 채널 추정 기법,2024,"['EEE 802.11p', 'WAVE system', 'LSTM', 'MLP', 'Complexity']","최근 WAVE 통신 시스템에서 딥러닝 기반 채널 추정 기법들이 활발히 연구되고 있다. 특히, long short term memory-multiple layer perceptron (LSTM-MLP) 기법은 채널의 주파수축 특성뿐만 아니라 시간축 특성까지 학습함으로써 채널의 주파수축 특성만 학습하는 기존 deep neural network (DNN) 계열의 채널 추정 기법보다 우수한 성능을 보인다. 그러나, LSTM-MLP 채널 추정 기법은 프레임 내 orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) 심볼의 위치에 따라 LSTM unit 수를 가변적으로 사용하는데, 이는 시스템의 복잡도를 증가시킬 뿐만 아니라 채널의 시간축 특성을 안정적으로 학습하기 어렵다는 단점이 있다. 이러한 문제점을 극복하기 위하여 본 논문에서는 LSTM unit 수를 고정적으로 사용하는 simplified LSTM-MLP (sLSTM-MLP) 기법을 제안한다. 제안 기법에서는 먼저 채널의 시간축 특성을 학습하기 위하여 LSTM 심층 신경망을 구현한다. 이후 LSTM 망의 출력 신호를 인가받아 MLP 망을 훈련함으로써 채널의 주파수축 특성을 학습하게 된다. 이때 LSTM unit의 수를 고정적으로 사용하기 때문에 복잡도를 낮추면서도 프레임 내 OFDM 심볼의 위치에 상관없이 안정적으로 채널 특성을 학습할 수 있으며, 이는 우수한 패킷에러율 (packet error rate, PER) 성능을 보장한다. 모의실험 결과 제안 기법이 기존 딥러닝 기반 채널 추정 기법 대비 우수한 성능을 나타내는 것을 확인하였다.","Recently, deep learning-based channel estimation techniques have been actively studied in WAVE communication systems. In particular, the long short term memory-multiple layer perceptron (LSTM-MLP) technique shows superior performance to the existing deep natural network (DNN) based channel estimation techniques, which learn only the spectral characteristics of the channel, by learning not only the spectral but also temporal characteristics. However, the LSTM-MLP uses the number of LSTM units variably depending on the position of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols in a frame, which not only increases the complexity of the system, but also has the disadvantage of making it difficult to learn the time-axis characteristics of the channel stably. To overcome this, in this paper, a simplified LSTM-MLP (sLSTM-MLP) technique is proposed, which uses the fixed number of LSTM units. In the proposed scheme, he LSTM is implemented to learn the temporal characteristics of the channel. After that, the spectral characteristics of the channel are learned by training the MLP network by receiving the output signal of the LSTM network. Because the proposed scheme uses the fixed number of LSTM units, it can reduce the computational complexity and guarantee the stable learning of the channel characteristics regardless of the position of OFDM symbols in a frame, resulting in enhancing the packet error rate (PER) performance. Through the simulation result, t was confirmed that the proposed technique exhibits superior performance compared to the existing deep learning-based channel estimation technique."

CNNs learning data measured breathing status by measuring chest movement using non-contact UWB radar distance measurement technology. Using non-contact UWB respiration sensor data, learning data was constructed by labeling it into respiration, apnea, and noise(movement). After offline learning was completed, breathing status was measured online, and the problems caused by movement were solved through deep learning."

This is because many of these structures are reaching their expected lifespan. Such structures require accurate inspections and persistent maintenance. Otherwise, their original functions and performance may degrade, potentially leading to safety accidents. Therefore, research on objective inspection technologies using deep learning and computer vision is actively being conducted. High-resolution images can accurately observe not only micro cracks but also spalling and exposed rebar, and deep learning enables automated detection. High detection performance in deep learning is only guaranteed with diverse and numerous training datasets. However, surface damage to concrete is not commonly captured in images, resulting in a lack of training data. To overcome this limitation, this study proposed a method for generating concrete surface damage images, including cracks, spalling, and exposed rebar, using stable diffusion. This method synthesizes new damage images by paired text and image data. For this purpose, a training dataset of 678 images was secured, and fine-tuning was performed through low-rank adaptation. The quality of the generated images was compared according to three base models of stable diffusion. As a result, a method to synthesize the most diverse and high-quality concrete damage images was developed. This research is expected to address the issue of data scarcity and contribute to improving the accuracy of deep learning-based damage detection algorithms in the future."

To integrate this, research on multi-modal image matching has been conducted in the field of computer vision and deep learning. However, computer vision algorithms like SIFT and ORB face challenges in producing good results due to domain differences between EO and IR images. There’s also a limitation in deep learning models due to data acquisition challenges. This paper addresses these issues by generating synthetic images resembling IR images from EO images and trained the deep learning-based feature point extraction model R2D2 in multi-modality. Experiments with EO and IR image pairs in various environments showed that the image matching success rate of R2D2 in multi-modal scenarios is only about 4.6% different compared to ORB in single modality, demonstrating successful matching. This confirms the potential of using synthetic data for multi-modal training in R2D2."

The first result, the volumes generated by the atlas-based smart segmentation method showed the smallest volume change as a function of the change in tube voltage and tube current, while Aview RT ACS and OncoStudio using deep learning showed smaller volumes at tube currents lower than 100 mA. The second result, the Dice similarity coefficient, showed that Aview RT ACS was 2% higher than OncoStuido, and the 95% Hausdorff distance results also showed that Aview RT ACS analyzed an average of 0.2-0.5% higher than OncoStudio. However, the standard deviation of the respective results for tube current and tube voltage is lower for OncoStudio, which suggests that the results are consistent across volume variations. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using deep learning-based automatic segmentation programs at low perfusion voltages and low perfusion currents in CT imaging conditions for lung radiotherapy, and similar results were obtained with conventional atlas-based automatic segmentation programs at certain perfusion voltages and perfusion currents."

The data are then uniformly standardized via linear interpolation. Additionally, to simplify the time-series vibration data patterns, the Hilbert transform and Butterworth low-pass filter are applied. The deep-learning model is structured with parallel components with both time and frequency domains, facilitating detection across various fault scenarios. In contrast to studies processing time-series data into fixed sizes, this approach demonstrates strong performance despite employing a relatively simple deep-learning model."

One common technique used in feature interaction networks is the outer product, which provides more information compared to other multiplication-based methods. However, existing models only utilize a single outer product, and there is a lack of research on combining multiple outer products. In this study, we propose a new model called the Heterogeneous Outer product-based Network (HON). HON incorporates an explicit layer for detecting feature interactions and combines it with a deep neural network to leverage the nonlinear capabilities of deep learning. The proposed approach also includes two different outer product operations, one at the feature level and another at the element level, to explicitly capture feature interactions. Experimental results show that the HON algorithm outperforms all benchmark algorithms on two widely used datasets."

In particular, the framework of action research was established in the stages of ‘understanding-exploration-coaching-implementation-reflection’ to clarify, structure, concrete, and elaborate concept-based competency formation classes. In addition, through a purposeful sampling method, concept-based competency formation classes were divided into individual classroom classes and collaborative classroom classes in the context of teaching and learning, and implications were derived from the design and application of class units.Results  As a result of the analysis, it was found that concept-based competency formation classes aim for ‘deep learning’ that connects knowledge and information obtained through inquiry learning to form core concepts and transfer them to various situations and contexts. In particular, the unit design and application of the individual classroom teaching model (understanding the problem, establishing a solution plan, implementing the solution plan, reviewing the solution process) and the collaborative classroom teaching model (discovering the central problem, generating ideas, interactive interaction, and real-life application) We were seeking to build learners' capabilities through ‘deep learning’. In addition, according to individual classroom classes and collaborative classroom classes, the inquiry elements were set as questions and exploration, composition and explanation, understanding and action, and organization and reflection, and a synergy strategy for concept-based competency formation classes was presented. Using this synergy strategy, we designed classes for individual classroom classes and collaborative classroom classes and reflected expert opinions to organize considerations in terms of unit design for concept-based competency formation classes.Conclusions  Concept-based competency formation classes reflect the characteristics and learning environment of individual classroom classes and collaborative classroom classes, and it was found that “in-depth learning” is effective when unit design is developed into subject identification, subject exploration, task execution, and task evaluation."

It involves determining whether two voice data belong to the same speaker. In cases where the criminal's voice remains at the crime scene, it is vital to establish a speaker verification system that can accurately compare the two voice evidence. In this study, to achieve this, a new speaker verification system was built using a deep learning model for Korean language. High-dimensional voice data with a high variability like background noise made it necessary to use deep learning-based methods for speaker matching. To construct the matching algorithm, the ECAPA-TDNN model, known as the most famous deep learning system for speaker verification, was selected. A large dataset of the voice data, Voxceleb, collected from people of various nationalities without Korean. To study the appropriate form of datasets necessary for learning the Korean language, experiments were carried out to find out how Korean voice data affects the matching performance. The results showed that when comparing models learned only with Voxceleb and models learned with datasets combining Voxceleb and Korean datasets to maximize language and speaker diversity, the performance of learning data, including Korean, is improved for all test sets."

Accordingly, it is possible to prevent unnecessary waste of national capabilities through the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) and unification of channels, and to provide high-quality security services by realizing simultaneous situation reception, analysis, measures, support, and reporting. To this end, it is necessary to improve the level of security and disaster environment by introducing machine and deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) into the integrated emergency reporting system along with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is also necessary to improve the manpower system in charge of the emergency reporting system. In the case of the organization and manpower in charge of the reporting system, they are distributed and operated by organization, so some organizations repeat shift work with relatively few manpower. As a result, it is difficult for the personnel in charge to have optimal reporting response capabilities due to increased work fatigue and lack of expertise due to frequent job shifts. In particular, the controversy over the 112 report and lack of response regarding the mass casualty accident in Itaewon in October 2022 can be said to be an example of showing limitations such as the operation of the reporting network by manpower. Considering this aspect, it can be said that measures to improve the macro level, such as organizational integration on the emergency reporting system, are necessary. Next, as mentioned above, anyone should be able to use the emergency reporting system in a timely manner in urgent situations, so the target also needs to be improved so that it can be accessed by the disabled and foreigners. For reference, artificial intelligence based on machine learning and deep learning is a technology that allows machines to perform actions by human intelligence, and artificial intelligence based on machine learning and deep learning has the potential to become a real dialogue partner and the subject of creating a discourse that can accurately grasp the context of human speech at a high level, not just a machine. Under these circumstances, the 112 Reporting Operation and Processing Act (abbreviated as 112 Reporting Act) and the 119 Reporting Management and Operation Act (abbreviated as 119 Reporting Act) have been created recently to stipulate the legal basis and methodology for its operation, but there are still insufficient points."

However, for the visually impaired, crosswalks can be a big risk factor. Although assistive tools such as braille blocks and acoustic traffic lights exist for safe walking, poor management can sometimes act as a hindrance to safety. This paper proposes a method to improve accuracy in a deep learning-based real-time crosswalk detection model that can be used in applications for pedestrian assistance for the disabled at the beginning. The image was binarized by utilizing the characteristic that the white line of the crosswalk image contrasts with the road surface, and through this, the crosswalk could be better recognized and the location of the crosswalk could be more accurately identified by using two models that learned the whole and the middle part of the crosswalk, respectively. In addition, it was intended to increase accuracy by creating a boundary box that recognizes crosswalks in two stages: whole and part. Through this method, additional frames that the detection model did not detect in RGB image learning from the crosswalk image could be detected."

In the proposed scheme, two neural networks are combined to learn both the temporal and spectral characteristics of the channel. One is the AE (autoencoder) which is trained to track the channel characteristic in the time domain and the other is the LSTM (long short term memory) which is trained to track the channel characteristic in the frequency domain. Firstly, the AE is trained and then the LSTM is sequentially trained based on the AE output. After that, the trained neural network is used to the conventional DPA (data pilot aided) process to estimate the channel values in frequency domain. It is noted that the proposed LSTM network consists of fixed number of LSTM units, so it enables to track the temporal variation of the channel reliably, regardless of the position of the OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) symbol in a frame. Therefore, the proposed scheme can enhance the PER (packet error rate) performance more by reducing the error propagation due to the DPA process. Through numerical results, it is confirmed that the proposed scheme shows the best PER performance of the conventional schemes in doubly selective channel environment."

Pose Estimation of Mobile Robot Using Image and Point-Cloud Data,2024,['Pose-estimation  · Sensor fusion  · Deep-Learning  · Localization  · Mobile robot'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"In Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, the precise estimation of the initial pose of a mobile robot presents a signifi cant challenge. The initial pose is crucial as it can signifi cantly reduce the accumulated errors in SLAM.Despite various advancements in pose estimation, accurately determining the initial pose in diff erent application scenarios continues to be a complex task, often requiring techniques such as loop closure. However, loop closure detection may not always be feasible, as it is time-consuming and relies on the robot revisiting previous paths or its initial starting position. In essence, most localization methods such as SLAM critically require the initial pose to estimate the mobile robot’s pose and the more precise initial pose makes the localization process to converge quickly. Addressing these persistent challenges, this paper proposes a novel method that utilizes both image and point cloud data, allowing for easy adaptation across diverse and dynamic environments. The method integrates well-known technologies such as NetVLAD, RootSIFT, 5-Point, and Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithms. This approach not only addresses the initial pose estimation problem but also provides an alternative to existing landmarks, enhancing adaptability to diverse and dynamic environments. NetVLAD is utilized to fi nd the most similar image data in stored images by comparing the image captured by the mobile robot with the stored images with pose data. The relative pose is estimated by applying the RootSIFT and 5-Point algorithm, and ICP algorithm to the found image and point cloud data, respectively. This method determines the fi nal pose of the mobile robot by combining each relative pose extracted from image data and point cloud data through weighted integration. The eff ectiveness of the proposed method is verifi ed by comparing it with existing deep learning-based pose estimation methods.

However, because most existing fire detection systems detect fire in the early stage of combustion when smoke is generated, rapid fire prevention actions may be delayed. Therefore we propose an early fire detection system that can perform early fire detection at a reasonable cost using LSTM, a deep learning model based on multi-gas sensors with high selectivity in the early stage of decomposition rather than the smoke generation stage. This system combines multiple gas sensors to achieve faster detection speeds than traditional sensors. In addition, through window sliding techniques and model light-weighting, the false alarm rate is low while maintaining the same high accuracy as existing deep learning. This shows that the proposed fire early detection system is a meaningful research in the disaster and engineering fields."

Most of these video surveillance systems employ an unsupervised learning approach, relying on exclusive training with normal data for anomaly detection. This is achieved through the use of an autoencoder structure that processes RGB data, mainly due to the challenges associated with defining all abnormal behaviors. However, this approach encounters a reduction in recognition accuracy when the environment or location changes. To address this issue, there is a need for an additional step involving the collection of environment-specific data. In this paper, we adopt Spatial-Temporal Convolution Network to analyze skeleton data by constructing a spatiotemporally connected graph from video data and performing graph convolution. The proposed module interprets poses and movements in successive video frames based on information extracted from human joint data. Furthermore, to overcome the limited anomaly detection performance caused by the generalization performance boundary issue in existing autoencoder-based anomaly detection, we propose a normalized flow model to learn normal data and to discriminate anomalous data. Processing skeleton-based data and implementing anomaly detection through normalized flow not only minimizes the impact of environmental factors but also ensures consistent performance across diverse settings. This approach overcomes the limitations associated with autoencoder models relying on RGB data, making it applicable and effective in public spaces. In this paper, we additionally define anomalous behaviors that commonly observed in real public spaces, such as instances of fainting integrated into the dataset for a more practical anomaly detection and robust against environmental factors and it is evaluated using existing open datasets, demonstrating its capacity to operate realistically across diverse environments."

Variables were extracted using Python, and mean difference, color difference, cluster analysis, and classification estimation were performed. In addition, we ran classification estimation using deep learning without explicit parameterization and compared it to the results of machine learning. While some significance was found in the mean differences of the variables, and a chi-square test showed a significant difference in the use of blue-green, the color differences, clustering, and classification estimates did not show any discrimination between the ad images. This study quantitatively presented the extent to which sustainability-themed advertisements are differentiated, and methodologically proposed a method for analyzing images by explicitly extracting variables, providing a basis for future research on various advertising themes through image analysis."

The Localization Effect of Online Advertising: An Evidence from the Movie Market,2024,"['movie poster', 'movie theater industry', 'international marketing', 'localization', 'image deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study introduces a novel deep learning-based framework designed to evaluate the impact of localization in online advertising within the film industry. Particularly, the authors consider movie poster images as an advertising tool. Employing an image-based deep learning technique, the study extracts and quantifies visual information to assess poster localization levels. Then, we estimate the effect of poster localization on the movie’s financial performance in a foreign market. The results reveal that the localization effect follows the U-shaped curve, implying that the relevant level of poster localization should be in two ways: either fully non-localized or extremely localized. We expect this research to contribute by proposing the empirical framework to not only explore the effect of online advertising in the service business, but also assess the effect of the international advertising strategy from the perspective of the movie poster localization. Moreover, we posit that this research has managerial implications in the sense that it can contribute to the decision-making process of the relevant level of localization and poster image modification."

Multiple feedback connections between two adjacent time steps leverage high-level features captured within a large receptive field to refine low-level features lacking sufficient contextual information. A carefully designed feedback module efficiently selects and enhances valuable information from the rerouted high-level features, thereby improving low-level features with enriched high-level information.

In an era where the complexities and intricacies of the Bible present significant challenges to contemporary readers, the prevalence of one-dimensional interpretations further obstructs the pathway to a profound comprehension of the spiritual depth embedded within its texts. By centering on Horst Klaus Berg’s influential theories in the field of German Bible didactics, this research delves into the impact of varied biblical interpretations on Christian education. Berg’s work is celebrated for its insightful strategies, notably his advocacy for comprehensive interpretative methods such as “Railway Tracks” and “Free-Learning.” These approaches seek to reconcile traditional biblical teachings with individual experiences, thereby facilitating a more expansive understanding of the Bible’s applicability to modern life. Through a detailed examination of Berg’s theory on biblical interpretation, this paper argues that Christian education must prioritize the cultivation of diverse interpretative skills and their practical integration into Bible study. This educational model encourages learners to become active interpreters, capable of discerning the text’s deep-seated meanings by relating it to their personal experiences. The study concludes by affirming Berg’s delineation of three critical tasks in biblical interpretation: “reciprocal interpretation,” “acknowledgment of the biblical texts’ diversity,” and “free learning.” These elements are portrayed as interrelated and essential, reinforcing Berg’s proposition that understanding the Bible’s complexity and diversity is crucial for advancing Christian education. This paper offers a novel perspective on the significance of embracing multifaceted interpretations within the domain of biblical studies."
Integrating the strengths of cVAE and cGAN into cAAE for advanced inverse design of colloidal quantum dots,2024,['Colloidal quantum dot · Inverse design · Deep learning · Conditional generative model'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit unique structures, which often result in distinctive optical properties such as emission and absorption spectra. However, QDs with diferent structures can sometimes show very similar emission and absorption spectra, making it difcult to inversely design their precise structural parameters from a given target emission and absorption spectra. To overcome this so-called one-to-many mapping problem, this paper introduces a novel deep-learning-based generative model for the inverse design of QDs. In particular, we implement three types of conditional generative models: the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), the conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE), and the conditional adversarial autoencoder (cAAE). Each model is designed and trained to predict possible layer thicknesses of QDs that can provide a given target emission and absorption spectra, thus providing possible multiple solutions rather than a single deterministic outcome. This multi-solution approach not only increases the fexibility in QD structure design, but also enhances the accuracy and efciency of the predictive process. According to calculation results, the cAAE stands out by efectively combining the strengths of both cGAN and cVAE. This integration allows cAAE to produce a more diverse and accurate inversely designed structures of InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs."

Method: This study conducted individual in-depth interviews with six teachers who were interested in the activity. Data collection took place from July 2023 to October 2023, and data were collected through 18 in-depth interviews and various records related to teachers’ activities over 18 in-depth interviews. Results: First, early childhood teachers had general images that activities had a structure and teachers took strong initiative, however, the perception of their activities appeared to change as they implemented the revised Nuri-curriculum. In particular, before the revision, teachers viewed play and activity as opposing concepts, but teachers felt that play and activity could not be divided while implementing the revised Nuri-curriculum. On the other hand, teachers also showed hesitation about if it would be right to engage in the activity itself. Second, teachers interpreted the meaning and methods of activities diversely as part of teaching and learning, while  carrying out a play-based curriculum. Based on this, they were effectively utilizing activities at appropriate moments. In this process, activities had meanings in three aspects: supporting play, supporting children, and supporting learning. Conclusion: Play and activity should be viewed as a continuous and intertwined relationship while fully understanding that activities have diverse values. It also indicates that there is a need to provide guidance on the role of teachers as facilitators in a broad perspective so that they can operate their activities smoothly as the main agent of the curriculum. In addition, it is required that teachers need to actively engage in practicing their activities based on deep reflection on how to perform activities considering the contents of learning."

The purpose of this study is to find out how much content knowledge is processed during English-medium instruction lectures by students using deep-level methods, i.e., critical thought, detailed information, and structure. Furthermore, the study investigates the potential correlation between the implementation of such strategies and the motivating beliefs and English listening proficiency of students. Using a mixed-methods approach, questionnaire responses and semi-structured interviews from 60 students in Korea were gathered. The results emphasize that students' self efficacy and intrinsic learning goals are more important indicators of their use of deep processing strategies than is their English listening competency.

YOLOv10 improves its performance compared to previous versions by adding an attention module, the PSA module. PSA is strong at recognising complex patterns in large areas because it uses some features of its own attention to reduce computation and learn global information. However, it may be inefficient for certain problems, such as weeds, which are generally small objects. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an improved YOLOv10 by applying another attention module, SENet, instead of the PSA module. Since, SENet learns the importance between channels, it can learn the features of weeds in more detail than the PSA module. In addition, SENet is lighter, less computationally intensive, and faster than the PSA module, so we conducted experiments by replacing the PSA module with SENet, which is suitable for weed detection. The experiment consisted of 200 training runs with a total of 14 classes, and we compared the performance through various performance evaluations.

With technology available for understanding and addressing the emotional needs of people, this study aims to develop speech emotion recognition (SER) technology to classify emotions for people at high risk of dementia. Methods: Speech samples from people at high risk of dementia were categorized into distinct emotions via human auditory assessment, the outcomes of which were annotated for guided deep-learning method. The architecture incorporated convolutional neural network, long short-term memory, attention layers, and Wav2Vec2, a novel feature extractor to develop automated speech-emotion recognition. Results: Twenty-seven kinds of Emotions were found in the speech of the participants. These emotions were grouped into 6 detailed emotions: happiness, interest, sadness, frustration, anger, and neutrality, and further into 3 basic emotions: positive, negative, and neutral. To improve algorithmic performance, multiple learning approaches were applied using different data sources-voice and text-and varying the number of emotions. Ultimately, a 2-stage algorithm-initial text-based classification followed by voice-based analysis-achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 70%. Conclusions: The diverse emotions identified in this study were attributed to the characteristics of the participants and the method of data collection. The speech of people at high risk of dementia to companion robots also explains the relatively low performance of the SER algorithm. Accordingly, this study suggests the systematic and comprehensive construction of a dataset from people with dementia."

Object name recognition is a branch of natural language processing and is an important research area for tasks such as information retrieval.

인공지능 문학의 가능성과 한계에 대한 연구,2024,"['인공지능', '문학 창작', '창의성', '자연어 처리', '인공지능의 예술적 한계', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Literary Creation', 'Creativity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'GPT-3', 'Artistic Limits of Artificial Intelligence']","오늘날 4차 산업혁명은 ICT와 AI의 발전을 통해 가속화되고 있으며, 인간은 다양한 첨단 과학기술을 통해 “생물학적 인간강화” 등의 혜택을 누리고 있다. 그러나 과학기술의 발전이 인간의 창작 영역을 위축시킬 수 있다는 우려도 존재한다. 본 연구는 AI가 문학 예술을 창작할 수 있는 가능성과 그 한계를 탐구한다.1984년 AI로 작성된 최초의 문학 시도 이후, AI의 문학 창작 기술은 심층학습(deep learning)의 도입으로 비약적인 발전을 이루었다. 특히 GPT-3는 이전 세대보다 훨씬 많은 텍스트와 1750억 개의 파라미터를 학습하여 뛰어난 언어 능력을 보인다. GPT-3는 인간의 글과 거의 분간하기 어려운 수준의 텍스트를 생성할 수 있으며, 일부 연구자들은 이를 창의적이고 위트 있으며, 깊이 있고 아름답다고 평가한다.그러나 GPT-3의 능력에 대한 의구심도 제기된다. GPT-3는 기존 작품을 기반으로 한 텍스트를 생성하는 데 그치며, 일관된 서사를 이루지 못하고, 인간 사용자의 지시가 필요하다는 한계가 있다. 또한, GPT-3는 통계적 확률에 기반해 단어를 선택하는 “확률 게임”을 하고 있으며, 이는 인간의 창작과는 본질적으로 다르다는 비판이 있다. 그럼에도 불구하고, GPT-3의 창작물은 종종 매력적이고 눈길을 끄는 부분을 포함하고 있다.문학 작품의 창작에서 새로움이란 '이야기'와 '이야기하기'에서의 새로움으로 구분된다. 이야기는 등장인물과 사건을 포함하는 '소설적 세계'를 전제하며, 완결된 이야기를 창조하는 것은 허구적 세계를 창조하는 것이다. 이야기 기법이나 스타일은 텔링(telling)이며, 이는 작가의 독특한 문체를 의미한다.인공지능이 각 단계에 도달할 수 있을지를 검토하는 것은 여전히 의미 있다. 인공지능이 어떤 양식을 흉내낼 수는 있겠으나, 그 산물이 지속적이고 고유한 형식적 특징을 가질 수 있는지에 대한 논의가 필요하다.AI의 시 창작 기술은 언어 모델을 기반으로 키워드를 입력하고, 이를 바탕으로 학습 데이터를 추출한 뒤, 이를 검토하고 수정하여 최종 시 텍스트를 생산하는 과정을 거친다. 시 텍스트는 감정과 사상을 함축적이고 운율적인 언어로 표현한 문학의 한 장르이다. 시 창작 기술의 과정에서 시인의 창작 행위와 AI의 시 창작 기술은 유사한 구조를 가지지만, 중요한 차이점은 AI는 주어진 키워드를 바탕으로 학습 데이터를 추출하는 데 그친다는 점이다.결론적으로, 인공지능이 창작성을 가질 수 있는가의 문제는 창작 범용 인공지능의 길에서 중간 단계를 찾는 것이 필요하다. 현재까지의 분석을 통해 허구의 세계를 구성하고 재생산할 수 있는 능력을 갖추는 것이 중요한 단계로 제시된다. 본 연구는 이러한 정의를 바탕으로 GPT-3의 창의성 여부를 논의하고, AI의 문학적 가능성과 철학적 문제를 다룬다. 이를 통해 AI의 문학 창작이 단순한 기술적 성과를 넘어 예술적, 창의적 가치를 지닐 수 있는지를 탐구하고자 한다.","Today, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is accelerating with the development of ICT and AI, and people are enjoying benefits such as “biological human enhancement” through various advanced technologies. However, there are also concerns that the advancement of science and technology may shrink the realm of human creativity. This study explores the possibilities and limitations of AI's ability to create literary art.Since the first AI-authored literary attempt in 1984, AI's ability to create literature has improved by leaps and bounds with the introduction of deep learning. GPT-3, in particular, has learned far more text and 175 billion parameters than its predecessors, resulting in a remarkable linguistic ability. GPT-3 can produce text that is virtually indistinguishable from human writing, and some researchers describe it as creative, witty, deep, and beautiful.However, there are questions about GPT-3's capabilities. GPT-3 is limited to generating text based on existing works, does not form a coherent narrative, and requires guidance from a human user. It has also been criticized that GPT-3 plays a “probability game,” choosing words based on statistical probabilities, which is inherently different from human creation. Nevertheless, GPT-3's creations often contain compelling and eye-catching parts.In the creation of literary works, novelty is divided into novelty in the “story” and novelty in the “telling” of the story. A story requires a “fictional world” that includes characters and events, and to create a finished story is to create a fictional world. The narrative technique or style is telling, which refers to the author's distinctive style.It is still useful to examine whether AI can reach each stage. While AI may be able to imitate some forms, the question remains whether its output will have lasting and unique formal characteristics.The technology for creating AI poetry involves entering keywords based on a language model, extracting."

Existing anomaly detection methods in big data scenarios with cloud–edge computing collaboration face several challenges, such as sample imbalance, difficulty in dealing withcomplex network traffic attacks, and difficulty in effectively training large-scale data or overly complex deeplearningnetwork models. A lightweight deep-learning model was proposed to address these challenges. First,normalization on the user side was used to preprocess the traffic data. On the edge side, a trained Wassersteingenerative adversarial network (WGAN) was used to supplement the data samples, which effectively alleviatesthe imbalance issue of a few types of samples while occupying a small amount of edge-computing resources.Finally, a trained lightweight deep learning network model is deployed on the edge side, and the preprocessedand expanded local data are used to fine-tune the trained model. This ensures that the data of each edge nodeare more consistent with the local characteristics, effectively improving the system's detection ability. In thedesigned lightweight deep learning network model, two sets of convolutional pooling layers of convolutionalneural networks (CNN) were used to extract spatial features. The bidirectional long short-term memorynetwork (BiLSTM) was used to collect time sequence features, and the weight of traffic features was adjustedthrough the attention mechanism, improving the model's ability to identify abnormal traffic features. Theproposed model was experimentally demonstrated using the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-ISD2018datasets. The accuracies of the proposed model on the three datasets were as high as 0.974, 0.925, and 0.953,respectively, showing superior accuracy to other comparative models. The proposed lightweight deeplearning network model has good application prospects for anomaly traffic detection in cloud–edgecollaborative computing architectures."

Enhancing Chest X-ray Image Super-Resolution through Residual Group and Channel Attention,2024,"['Chest X-ray', 'Super-Resolution', 'Remaining Enhanced channel attention block', 'Exponential Liner Unit', 'Structure Similarity Index', 'Multi Structure Similarity Index.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Medical imaging plays a crucial role in medical diagnosis, with chest X-ray imaging being a widely employed method for screening and diagnosing pulmonary diseases due to its cost-effectiveness. However, low-resolution images generated by expensive equipment and suboptimal imaging techniques often lead to a loss of critical features and acceptable texture. The acquisition of high-quality medical images is paramount for accurate disease diagnosis. This study introduces an innovative approach for reconstructing super-resolution medical images using deep learning techniques, explicitly targeting chest X-ray images. The proposed method, the Pathologically Invariant Remaining Enhanced Channel Attention Block (RECAB), incorporates the Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function. The primary objective is to accurately recover high-resolution (HR) chest X-ray images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts, leveraging a channel attention mechanism and convolution layer with the ELU activation function―the evaluation of the proposed method involved two datasets, X-Ray 2017 and X-Ray 2014. A comprehensive comparison was conducted with several state-of-the-art techniques, including GAN-based super-resolution, deep learning-based super-resolution, and interpolation-based super-resolution. The quality of the preprocessed images was assessed using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MSIM). The results prove the higher performance of the proposed method, which outperformed the average of 8.6% and 11.6% in SSIM and MSIM values by 11% and 12.14% on the two datasets, respectively. This research signifies a significant advancement in enhancing the resolution and quality of chest X-ray images, holding substantial potential for improving diagnostic accuracy and aiding in medical decision-making."

정동적 객체로서의 인공지능예술 고찰,2024,"['인공지능예술', '인공지능', '비인간 전회', '객체지향존재론', '정동이론', 'AI arts', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Nonhuman turn', 'Object -oriented ontology', 'Affect theory']","이 논문은 인공지능이 우리에게 어떤 의미를 지니는지에 관해 인공지능예술을 통해 고찰하는 것을 목적으로 한다. 연구방법은 인공지능예술의 사례를 조사하고 비인간 존재론에 관한 문헌 연구를 진행하는 것이다. 연구의 첫 단계에서는 마이클 놀의 선구적 작업부터 딥러닝에 기반한 최근 예술까지 일람한다. 1960년대 놀과 추리는 수학적 함수와 난수 생성기를 이용하여 추상적인 드로잉이나 애니메이션을 제작했고, 1970년대부터 코헨은 ‘아론’(AARON)이라는 전문가 시스템을 사용하여 드로잉과 회화를 창작했다. 인공지능예술이 본격화된 것은 2010년대 이후 딥러닝 기술이 발전하면서부터다. 도서관, 미술관 등의 아카이브 데이터를 환상적인 영상으로 시각화하는 아나돌, 조건부 GAN을 활용하여 세상에 존재하지 않는 얼굴이나 꽃 이미지를 창출하는 클링게만과 리들러는 인공지능예술의 해외 사례 중 손꼽을만하다. 국내 예술가 중에도 신승백과 김용훈 팀, 강은수, 노진아처럼 일찍부터 인공지능 소프트웨어를 활용한 사례가 있다. 연구의 둘째 단계는 객체지향존재론(OOO)과 정동이론에 준거하여 인공지능예술의 존재론적 함의를 파악하는 것이다. OOO를 지향하는 브라이언트와 하먼은 인간을 포함한 일체의 사물을 동등하게 ‘객체’임을 논증한다. 정동이론가 마수미는 ‘정동’(affect)을 모든 신체들 사이에서 촉발되는 강렬도의 변화라고 파악한다. 즉각적이고 역동적인 정동은 마주치는 모든 유형의 몸체들에 변화를 초래한다. 본고의 연구결과는 다음과 같다. 즉 하먼과 마수미 등의 비인간주의 철학에 비추어 볼 때 인공지능은 인간과 마찬가지로 ‘정동적 객체’로 파악되며, 인공지능예술은 이 점을 직관적으로 알려준다는 것이다. 이를테면 아나돌이나 노진아의 인공지능 예술작품은, 인간과 인공지능이 동등한 위상에서 상호작용함으로써 서로의 존재를 변화시킨다는 사실을 관객으로 하여금 깨닫게 해준다는 것이다. 인공지능예술에 대한 본고의 고찰을 통해 우리는 오늘날 인간이 인공지능과 얼마나 의미심장한 관계를 맺고 있는지 재고할 기회를 얻을 수 있다.","This paper aims to explore what AI means to humans through researching the examples of AI arts and conducting a literature review on Non-human ontologies. The first step of the research is to trace the pioneering work of Michael Noll to recent artworks based on deep learning. In the 1960s, Noll and Csuri used random number generators to create abstract drawings and animations, and from the 1970s, Cohen used an expert system called AARON to create drawings and paintings. AI arts has been in full swing since the 2010s, when deep learning technology accelerated. Anadol, who visualizes archival data from libraries and museums into fantastic images, is one of the most prominent overseas instances of AI arts. Korean artists such as E. Kang, and J. Noh have also utilized AI softwares early on. The second step is to identify the ontological implications of AI arts based on object-oriented Ontologies (OOO) and Affective theories. Bryant and Harman, who pursue OOO, argue that all things, including humans, are equally ‘objects’. Affect theorist Masumi understands ‘affect’ as a change in intensity that is triggered between all bodies: immediate and dynamic, affect causes changes in all types of bodies that encounter other ones. In the light of nonhumanist philosophies such as Harman’s and Masumi’s, AI is understood as an ‘affective object’ just like humans, and AI arts intuitively inform us of this. In other words, AI artworks such as Anadol’s and Noh’s make the viewers realize that humans and AI interact on an equal footing, transforming each other’s existence. The examination of AI arts in this article gives us the opportunity to reconsider how meaningful our relationship with AI is today."

With the recent development of artificial intelligence technology, research for diagnosing plant disease using deep learning-based image recognition technology is actively underway. Deep learning models require a large amount of learning data, but it is really difficult to collect plant disease images due to the seasonality and lack of professional workforce. In particular, rare diseases such as Fire Blight are more difficult to collect. Data augmentation is a representative way to solve this problem. Currently, research is being actively conducted to augment the image of pests, but it is mainly augmenting images taken in an artificial environment or diseases images that symptoms of infection appears in the entire leaf area. However, it is necessary to generate realistic images containing various background areas as if they were taken at the farmhouse, not in an artificially created environment, to help improve the performance of the plant disease diagnosis model. In addition, in the case of Fire Blight, the symptoms do not appear in the entire leaf area, but black spots spread along the leaf vein. Therefore, this study explores generative AI techniques to effectively augment the leaf image of Fire Blight. After applying three methods: Traditional (Unconditional) GAN, Image-to-Image Translation, and Style Transfer, the results will be compared and analyzed."

Deep learning-based crop type classification, particularly through pixel-based classification methods such as semantic segmentation, faces issues like highly imbalanced class distribution and spectral correction errors caused by vignetting when mosaicing drone images. The proposed methods address the multi-class crop type classification in UAV imagery by approaching it from a parcel-based image classification perspective. By combining outputs from the Segment-Anything model with predefined smart farm maps that represent the agricultural parcel boundaries nationwide, the method successfully identifies the actual agricultural parcel boundaries in the given imagery that were not fully aligned with the vector maps. Parcel-based crop type classification was performed by assigning each image to a single class within the identified parcel boundaries. Performed on the publicly opened dataset with a differently designed form which are semantic segmentation and image classification each, the experiments show that the method has a promising increase of mean Intersection over Union performance.

To improve the visual uniformity of the composite images, deep learning-based image harmonization techniques that adjust the lighting and color of foreground objects to match the background image have been actively proposed recently. However, existing techniques have limited performance in visual uniformity because they adjust colors only for the lighting color distribution of the dataset used for training. To address this problem, we propose a novel image harmonization scheme that has robust performance for various lighting colors. First, iHColor, a new dataset composed of various lighting color distributions, is built through data preprocessing. Then, a pre-trained GAN-based Harmonization model is fine-tuned using the iHColor dataset. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can generate harmonized images with better visual uniformity than existing models for various lighting colors."

The extracted results from U-Net were then compared and evaluated for accuracy against those obtained using ISODATA, a traditional satellite image classification method. Our findings indicate that U-Net demonstrates superior accuracy in extracting wildfire-affected areas compared to ISODATA. By augmenting the training data to further enhance the U-Net model’s performance and automating the process, we can readily generate time-series spatial data of wildfireaffected areas in Korea.

Among the various components of autonomous ships, automatic recognition systems that can replace human vision are a crucial area of research. While ongoing studies utilize traditional perception sensors such as RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging) and AIS (Automatic Identification System), they have limitations such as blind spots and a restricted detection range. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new recognition method that utilizes multiple cameras, including electro-optical and infrared radiation cameras, to supplement traditional perception sensors. This method aims to detect maritime obstacles accurately and estimate their dynamic motion using a tracking process. Initially, real-sea images were collected for maritime obstacle detection, and a deep-learning-based detection model was trained on them. The detection results were then employed in an adaptive tracking filter, which allowed the precise motion estimation of the obstacles. Furthermore, to compensate for the limitations of using individual cameras as sensors, this study introduces the simultaneous fusion of tracked data from multiple cameras. This fusion process enhances tracking results in various ways. In field tests using multiple Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), the proposed method successfully converged tracking results within the range of GPS errors. In addition, the fusion of tracked data from multiple cameras significantly improved the tracking results obtained from a single camera."

Height growth curves were compared across three phenotyping tools (ImageJ, OpenCV, and PlantCV), each of which showed distinct performance characteristics at different stages of rice growth. ImageJ displayed significant variability in early growth stages, while OpenCV suffered from decreased accuracy during later stages. PlantCV, however, provided stable and consistent results across all stages, making it the most reliable tool for this phenotypic analysis. We also examined the effects of replicate sampling, camera angle selection, and outlier removal on data variability and error rates. Results indicated that replicate sampling alone was insufficient to control variability; however, combining optimized processing techniques, particularly angle selection and outlier exclusion, substantially improved data reliability and precision.Outlier removal, along with selecting maximum angle values, contributed to smoother growth curves with less variability, enhancing the robustness of the data. The reliability of these phenotypic traits was further validated through genome- wide association studies (GWAS), using 12,127 SNPs iden- tified via a deep learning-based GBS(Genotyping-by-Sequen-cing) pipeline. The GWAS analysis identified significant SNPs associated with rice height on chromosomes 3, 6, and 9. Notably, genes such as OsBIG, OsGH9B3, OsSTRL2, and OsCCS52A were confirmed to play roles in rice height, linking them to growth hormone biosynthesis pathways. This optimized phenotypic analysis method demonstrates strong potential for identifying trait-associated markers in rice and other crop plants."

One is a CNN model with five convolution layers and two dense layers, and the other is a bidirectional LSTM model with two Bi-LSTM layers and two dense layers. Prediction-score fusion methods were presented that fuse the prediction results from multiple segments. The fusion method uses four rules: majority rule, product rule, sum rule, and max rule. This study uses a database with seven daily activities: walking, running, sit-down, stand-up, bending, falling, and lying down. Experimental results show that a downsampling method can more accurately identify human activity with shorter signals than the sliding window method. The proposed CNN and bidirectional LSTM models show an accuracy of 89.29% and 95.24%, respectively, for single-segment signals. It shows the effectiveness of the proposed model. Furthermore, it confirms that accuracy can be improved using the prediction-score fusion method using multiple segments."

Given this conditions, a research trend on North Korean cities is gradually moving away from the static approach at the macro level toward the dynamic perspective at the micro level. Following this change, the methodological tradition also attempts to achieve a balance between qualitative and quantitative analysis of the contents of everyday life through the application of cutting-edge technologies such as geographic information systems, digital ethnography, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. This suggests some important implications in that it broadens the scope of research in the field by formatting the topography of North Korean urban studies from a new perspective, and overcomes the limitations of data and partiality by utilizing various research methods. An in-depth analysis of North Korea’s hidden social forces identifies the psychological residue of the residents embedded in urban space, which can be useful for predicting a future track. For the era of unification of the Korean Peninsula, a social formation and its potential via the functions of the state and market need to diagnose. Furthermore, continuous research efforts meet to promote a cumulative manner by an innovative research system based on interdisciplinary or industry-academia-research networks."

Subsequently, labels for the characteristic categories of complaints were defined, followed by a comparative analysis of the performance of each classification algorithm using supervised learning.Results in Research: The experimental results showed that the classification accuracy followed the order of CNN < LSTM < Ko-BERT. Thus, it was revealed that for multi-category classification of diverse topics in informal and small-scale text, it is essential to consider sequences and contexts rather than extracting document features.Research Conclusion: The academic contribution of this study lies in comparing and analyzing algorithms from traditional classifiers to the latest deep learning algorithms under the same experimental conditions, thereby elucidating the differences between algorithms. From a practical standpoint, the evaluation of classification performance for informal documents such as complaints in this study could be utilized for processing and classifying low-quality text data of various topics, including small-scale SNS data and other complaints with complex categories, in the future."

Finally, the retrieval and matching performances of ResNet and SIFT were evaluated using 50 original data samples and 4,800 augmented data samples created by various forms of editing. ResNet demonstrated an average matching performance of 72.54%, whereas SIFT achieved an average matching performance of 86.71%.The findings reveal that, unlike ResNet-50, which compares similarity using the entire image information, SIFT evaluates similarity based on attribute information, such as key points within the image. Consequently, ResNet is advantageous for identifying visually similar images, whereas SIFT excels in identifying identical images."

The experimental results demonstrated that YOLOv8 achieved a high object detection performance with an mAP50 of 0.99 and an mAP50-95 of 0.75, indicating a high degree of agreement between detected and actual objects. In terms of lane change prediction, the Transformer model outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 0.977, which is 0.02 higher, and the lowest misclassification rate in the confusion matrix. This study is expected to contribute to improving traffic systems by serving as a valuable resource for efficient traffic flow management in the future."

False reports are problematic in that they not only waste police power, but also make it difficult to respond to situations that need help. In order to respond to the increase in false reports, this researcher proposes a 112 false report classification and prediction model based on deep learning. This model receives the report text summarized by the 112 situation room receptionist and determines whether the report is false or misidentified. Mistaken reports are almost impossible to detect on the surface from the point of view of the person who filed the report. Because of this, the researcher conducted an experiment dividing data containing all false reports and data containing only malicious false reports. Model training was performed with the same hyperparameters for five models with transformer structures: BERT,KoBERT, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa. This study is significant in that it took a problem-solving approach to the police's actual security work using natural language processing and LLM.

However, this progress has led to an increase in malicious activities, such as voice phishing (voishing), where generated voices are exploited for criminal purposes. Numerous models have been developed to detect the presence of synthesized voices, typically by extracting features from the voice and using these features to determine the likelihood of voice generation.This paper proposes a new model for extracting voice features to address misuse cases arising from generated voices. It utilizes a deep learning-based audio codec model and the pre-trained natural language processing model BERT to extract novel voice features. To assess the suitability of the proposed voice feature extraction model for voice detection, four generated voice detection models were created using the extracted features, and performance evaluations were conducted. For performance comparison, three voice detection models based on Deepfeature proposed in previous studies were evaluated against other models in terms of accuracy and EER. The model proposed in this paper achieved an accuracy of 88.08%and a low EER of 11.79%, outperforming the existing models. These results confirm that the voice feature extraction method introduced in this paper can be an effective tool for distinguishing between generated and real voices."

Nevertheless, the manufacturing industry urgently requires integrated artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance productivity because of the scarcity of human resources, the high costs involved, and the long time needed to attain an expert level. This study aims to classify welding defects using the EGG model based on CNN (Constitutional Neural Network). This study collected two types of welding defect images: a visual test (VT) and a radioisotope test (RT). There are four categories of welding defects: VT defects, which include porosity, incomplete penetration, lack of fusion, and undercut, and RT defects, which consist of cracks, porosity, lack of fusion, and slag inclusion. We also collected normal data. We input the raw image, not data p reprocessing, and achieve classification performances of 98% in VT and 92% in RT, respectively. Our finding is significant because it was conducted without data purification, such as data augmentation.

As mathematics is an essential subject of the K-12 curriculum, research on automated scoring of constructed mathematical responses is of great importance. However, unlike research on automated scoring in other subjects’ responses, studies for automated scoring of mathematical responses still require further exploration. In this study, we propose classification criteria for mathematical constructed responses including response types and input types, identified 21 studies from 15 academic journals registered in SCOPUS with systematic literature review, and investigated them in detail. As a result, Research on automated scoring of mathematical constructed responses has gradually increased in the 2010s, and mainly focusing on algebra and functions, number and operations at the secondary school level. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, automated scoring models have also evolved from early rule-based and statistical-based models to machine learning-, deep learning-, and large language models. Furthermore, early automated scoring studies which focused solely on single-modal and digital formatted answers are progressing toward automated scoring of multi-modal and handwritten answers. Based on these findings, We propose a framework that can classify research based on response types and input data formats. Finally, we conclude by emphasizing the importance and necessity of research in automated scoring of constructed mathematical responses, and by providing suggestions for future research directions."

To be more specific, we could say that there is emergent property if there is causally affecting computational power to the environment for its(or his/her) own future benefit when one individual system that is influenced by the surroundings. It is possible for Artificial Life to activate and affect causally to the environment on the basis of information that it perceived from the circumstances. For an example, in this paper, human brain dish cells that Kagan and others, Australian research team, did is suggested. In the experiments, rat’s and human dish cells and AI are tested. According to the results of the experiments, to learn a specific simulation game it took only 5 minutes for human brain dish while it took more than 90 minutes for an AI. In the mean while, if there is no stimulus rat’s brain dish cells were quicker to adapt to the environment than human’s. Human brain dish cells learned scarcely when there was no stimulus or feedback at all. They, however, learned much better when there were stimuli and feedbacks.This paper distinguishes computational power from computational capacity while it does not differentiate causal power from causal efficacy. Judging by the brain dish cells experiments, distinguishing those two are against the experimental results. In this paper, causal power is given as an example for computational power. Distinguishing computational power from computational capacity is that to differentiate human’s from AI’s. Penrose’s argument on the basis of Gödel’s incompleteness theorem says incomputationability of AI. Incomputationability means it has computational capacity while it has no computational power. Brain dish cells experiments show possibility that artificial life, especially a cyborg form of human brain dish cells combined with machine, can have true Gödel sentence. And they also show us that humans alive can be programmed by deep-learning algorithm. The limit of the experiments is that it does not seem like it would show highly enough autonomy since dish brain cells, by their own innate mechanism, are dependent on the simulation environment. Brain dish cells show us necessary condition for emergence that is computational power, but they do not show us autonomy that is sufficient condition to be considered to have a mind, consciousness, or soul."

The study has three specific research objectives. First, it examines the most frequently appearing words in domestic news articles related to migrant workers to identify key keywords. Second, it extracts the main topics covered in news articles related to migrant workers to understand the contentious issues. Lastly, it analyzes the positive and negative tones of news articles on each topic to discern the media’s perspective on these issues. For this research, 1,025 articles published by 96 media outlets from January 2020 to September 2023 were collected using web crawling techniques. After that, term frequency analysis, and LDA topic modeling were performed using Python coding and dictionary-based sentiment analysis was conducted using text analysis tool LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count)-22. Additionally, to utilize LIWC22, which performs analysis based on English words, a deep learning-based translation software DeepL was also used to translate the Korean articles into English before applying LIWC. The results revealed that ‘employment’, ‘center’, ‘government’, ‘resident’, and ‘wage’ were among the top keywords related to migrant workers. Topic modeling analysis identified ‘local centers and medical support’, ‘housing conditions and improvements’, ‘seasonal and domestic labor policies’, ‘marriage migrant women and employment systems’, and ‘industrial accidents and discrimination’ as the main issues.

Environmental factors, such as ultraviolet light and natural aging, often affect structural changes of such lymphatic vessels, causing skin dysfunction. However, some limitations still exist because of no alternatives to animal testing. To better understand the skin lymphatic system, a biomimetic microfluidic platform, skin-lymph-on-a-chip, was fabricated to develop a novel in vitro skin lymphatic model of humans and to investigate the molecular and physiological changes involved in lymphangiogenesis, the formation of lymphatic vessels. Briefly, the platform involved co-culturing differentiated primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) and dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs) in vitro. Based on our system, LymphanaxTM, which is a condensed Panax ginseng root extract obtained through thermal conversion for 21 days, was applied to evaluate the lymphangiogenic effect, and the changes in molecular factors were analyzed using a deep-learning-based algorithm. LymphanaxTM promoted healthy lymphangiogenesis in skin-lymph- on-a-chip and indirectly affected HDELCs as its components rarely penetrated differentiated NHEKs in the chip. Overall, this study provides a new perspective on LymphanaxTM and its effects using an innovative in vitro system."

디카시와 웹3.0의 현대시 -ChatGPT와 Midjourney를 중심으로-,2024,"['modern Korean poetry', 'web 3.0', 'dica-poem', 'AI', 'ChatGPT', 'Midjourney', '현대시', '웹 3.0', '디카시', 'AI', 'ChatGPT', 'Midjourney']","웹3.0에서 현대시라는 장르는 어떻게 될까 라는 간단한 질문으로부터 연구가 시작되었다. 인간과 AI가 가장 큰 차이를 보이는 창의성의 영역이라 할 수 있는 글쓰기 혹은 문학의 영역에서 또한 AI가 인간의 능력을 곧 따라잡을 것처럼 보인다. 이제, 인간과 비인간 AI가 협력하고 초연결되는 현시대에서 AI를 활용하여 예술작품을 창작하는 광경은 낯선 일이 아닐 것이다.AI와 공존해야 하는 현 상황에서 본고는 시와 이미지를 동시에 결합하는 시 쓰기에 주목하였다. 리듬과 더불어 이미지는 관념과 사물이 만나는 곳이자 시인의 주관적 감정에 따라 선택된 것으로서 시의 가장 중요한 요소이기 때문이다. 따라서 시의 이미지가 형성되는 과정은 인간과 AI와의 차이를 극명하게 잘 보여줄뿐더러, 인간이 어느 지점에서 AI를 적극적으로 활용할 수 있는지를 살펴볼 수 있다. 이에 따라 본고는 최근 AI혁명을 주도하고 있는 초거대 AI 언어모델 ‘ChatGPT’와 AI 이미지 생성 프로그램 ‘Midjourney’를 디카시 창작 과정과 연관지어 살펴보았다.가장 먼저, 디카시는 이미지(사진)와 시(문자)가 ‘동시에’ 결합하여 5행 이내로 창작되는 시임을 확인하였다. 문제는 이미지에 붙어 있는 잉여의 의미는 인간 개인적 기억에서 구성해 낸 것이라는 점이다. 이 과정까지는 우리가 일반적으로 볼 수 있는 인간만의 창의적인 영역이라 할 수 있다.초거대 언어모델 ChatGPT를 활용한 경우, 인간은 AI와의 상호작용이 실시간으로 진행되면서 인간이 만족할 만큼의 ‘생성 시(generative poem)’와 ‘AI 예술’로서의 이미지를 동시에 결과물로 얻어낼 수 있다. 물론, 아직까지 AI Image Generator의 이미지는 인간의 예술작품과 이질적일뿐더러 딥 러닝된 데이터들의 ‘조합’에 해당하지만, 머지않아 AI의 기술이 더욱 발전하면서 ‘창작’에 가까운 결과물을 내놓게 될 것이다.Midjourney는 ChatGPT와 다르게 그래픽 디자이너의 창작물이라 할 만큼 완성도 있는 이미지를 생성해 낸다. Midjourney는 ChatGPT처럼 시를 생성해 낼 수 없으나, 시에 관한 구체적인 설명을 입력하면 인간의 창작물에 가까운 이미지를 결과물로 내놓는다. 그러나 만약 시인 혹은 사용자가 추상적이고 관념적인 작품을 Midjourney에 입력하거나, 보다 자유롭게 이미지를 얻기 위해 피상적으로 시를 설명한다면, 작품과 동떨어지거나 뜻하지 않은 이미지를 결과물로 얻게 될 것이다. 이때의 Midjourney의 창작물은 인간의 ‘창작’에 가까울 것이다.요컨대, 이미지를 선택하고 시를 쓰는 행위는 인간만의 작업이지만, AI를 활용하여 예술작품을 창작하는 것도 얼마든지 가능하다. 이때, 우리는 어디까지의 작업을 인간의 영역이라고 불러야 할지 심각하게 고민해야 할 것이다.","The research started from a simple question: What will the genre of modern poetry look like in Web 3.0? Writing, or the domain of literature, is considered an area of creativity where humans and AI show the most significant difference, yet it seems that AI will soon catch up to human abilities in this domain as well. In today’s era, where humans and non-human AI cooperate and are hyperconnected, creating art using AI is no longer a strange sight.In this context, where coexistence with AI is inevitable, this study focuses on poetry writing that combines both poetry and images simultaneously. Along with rhythm, imagery is one of the most critical elements of poetry, as it is where abstract ideas and tangible objects meet, selected based on the poet's subjective emotions. Thus, the process of forming poetic images sharply illustrates the differences between humans and AI, while also revealing where humans can actively harness AI. Accordingly, this paper examines the process of creating digital poetry (dica-poetry) in connection with ChatGPT, a leading large-scale AI language model in the current AI revolution, and Midjourney, an AI image generation program.First, it was confirmed that digital poetry is a form of poetry where an image (a photograph) and words (text) are created simultaneously within five lines. The issue lies in the fact that the surplus meaning attached to the image is derived from personal human memory. Up to this point, we can still see this as a purely creative domain unique to humans.When using large-scale language models like ChatGPT, humans can interact with AI in real-time and obtain results that are satisfactory as both a 'generative poem' and 'AI art.' Although, for now, AI-generated images still feel unfamiliar and different from human-made artworks, being more like combinations of deep-learned data. However, it won’t be long before AI technology evolves to produce results that are much closer to genuine ""creation.“ Unlike ChatGPT, which generates text, Midjourney creates highly complete images, resembling those crafted by graphic designers. While Midjourney cannot generate poems, it can produce images close to human creativity when provided with detailed descriptions of a poem. However, if the poet or user inputs an abstract or conceptual work into Midjourney, or provides superficial descriptions to obtain a more free-form image, the resulting image may deviate from or be unrelated to the original work. In such cases, Midjourney's creations may come closer to human ""creation.“ In summary, selecting images and writing poetry are fundamentally human tasks, but creating art using AI is entirely possible. At this point, we must seriously consider which parts of the process should still be called human work."
Research on Equal-resolution Image Hiding Encryption Based on Image Steganography and Computational Ghost Imaging,2024,"['Computational ghost imaging', 'Deep learning', 'Equal-resolution image steganography', 'Optical image encryption']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Information-hiding technology is introduced into an optical ghost imaging encryption scheme, which can greatly improve the security of the encryption scheme. However, in the current mainstream research on camouflage ghost imaging encryption, information hiding techniques such as digital watermarking can only hide 1/4 resolution information of a cover image, and most secret images are simple binary images. In this paper, we propose an equal-resolution image-hiding encryption scheme based on deep learning and computational ghost imaging. With the equal-resolution image steganography network based on deep learning (ERIS-Net), we can realize the hiding and extraction of equal-resolution natural images and increase the amount of encrypted information from 25% to 102% when transmitting the same size of secret data. To the best of our knowledge, this paper combines image steganography based on deep learning with optical ghost imaging encryption method for the first time. With deep learning experiments and simulation, the feasibility, security, robustness, and high encryption capacity of this scheme are verified, and a new idea for optical ghost imaging encryption is proposed."
日本における「学び」の解釈―『論語』の学而篇の「學」の解釈を例として―,2024,"['まなぶ、まねぶ、論語、學、注釈者', 'learn', 'imitate', 'Analecte', 'Gaku', 'interpeter']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In ancient Japan, there was no written language. In other words, in order to learn something, it was important to ‘imitate’ the other person. There was no self-study, and no systematic ‘learning’. However, when written language was introduced, the meaning of ‘learning’ became more significant. It is thought that it changed into ‘learning’ that required deep thought. This was particularly evident in the Edo period. The concrete practice of ‘learning’ was attempted by using the Analects. Ito Jinsai 伊藤仁斎 considered ‘learning’ to be imitation, while Ogyu Sorai 荻生徂徠 considered the purpose of learning to be ‘learning the ways of the former kings’. Furthermore, the purpose of learning is to improve one’s own virtue through the ways learned from one’s teacher. ‘Learning’ was interpreted as ‘acquiring’ and ‘knowledge’, and in the late Edo period, the concept was formed that ‘learning’ belongs to ‘knowledge’ and ‘practice’ belongs to ‘practice’, which expresses accumulated ‘learning’ (knowledge). This is thought to have changed from Zhu Xi 朱子’s interpretation, in which ‘learning’ was the concept of remembering and realizing things, to being influenced by Yangmingism 陽明学.Furthermore, during the Meiji period, Western words were imported. Shibusawa Eiichi 渋沢栄一, backed by the idea of ​​the unity of knowledge and action, spoke of utilizing the Analects of Confucius as practical ethics. Shibusawa probably thought ‘learning’ as ‘knowledge for practice’, and that ‘learning’ and ‘practice’ should be one and the same. On the other hand, Nishi Amane 西周, who also came into contact with Western words, spoke of knowledge and action, but thought ‘learning’ and ‘practice’ as separate entities. In particular, he considered ‘learning’ as the pursuit of the psychology of things, and drew a line between it and everyday life. After that, ‘learning’ developed into something that pursues truths that are separate from everyday life.As mentioned above, by looking at how ‘learning’ is perceived, we can find the change in the attitude towards learning in Japanese society. There, the meaning of learning changed due to foreign influences, and attempts were made to incorporate it into everyday life. Since the modern era, it appears that learning has been influenced by the West and has evolved into something more detached from everyday life."

However, they suffer from pooraccuracy in various environmental conditions such as nighttime, fog, rain, and snow. On the other hand, IR (Infrared) images areprocessed with only thermal information, so the resolution is lower than RGB images, but they are less sensitive to environmentalconditions.

However, these systems, which are both large-scale and highly complex, pose challenges when it comes to timely and eff ective problemsolving using a run-to-fail policy-based reactive maintenance approach.

To address this issue, performance can be enhanced by leveraging adversarial domain adaptation techniques. However, the experiments conducted using the DA (Domain Adaptation) RetinaNet model, which applied adversarial domain adaptation techniques to RetinaNet, revealed no performance improvement. This lack of improvement was attributed to the fact that the size of the car license plate data used was smaller compared to the model size.

Since it is very difficult to acquire fault data in the field, unsupervised learning methods that can be trained using only normal state data are mainly used. However, unsupervised learning methods are very vulnerable to disturbances and are difficult to express the fault level. Disturbances in the field include electrical noise, which can cause data acquisition devices to fail due to low power quality in the field and affect the measured signal, and mechanical noise, such as external vibrations, which directly affect the operation of the electric motor. To minimize the impact of electrical noise, it is common to use hardware filters. Unlike previous studies that use theoretical cutoff frequency setting methods, this paper proposes a method to find the appropriate cutoff frequency using LRP(Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) analysis, one of the XAI(eXplainable A.I) techniques, for practical data acquisition.Fault diagnosis in the field requires robust unsupervised learning algorithms that can ignore the presence of mechanical noise in the signal, such as transient shocks. This is solved by post-processing the output of the auto-encoder with a moving average filter. To represent the fault level a data generation technique, the mix-up algorithm, is used. A method is proposed to threshold the auto-encoder multiple times with data generated by the mix-up algorithm.

The purpose of segmentation is to simplify or transform the expression of the image to make it more meaningful and easier to interpret. Among these, semantic segmentation classifies an image pixel-by-pixel. This paper proposes a method to obtain multispectral images of plants using a multi-lens camera and build a semantic segmentation dataset by matching the images for each band. Matching the images is essential for analysis because the camera used for filming is a system that acquires images of a single wavelength with seven lenses. A method of matching the remaining images based on one of five wavelength images related to color was applied for image registration. ORB was used as a method for matching. A semantic segmentation dataset for deep learning was constructed based on the matched images. Plants generally tend to have relatively high pixel values in the green channel in the visible light range compared to the red and blue channels and have large pixel values in the infrared range. Therefore, only the plant portion of the image can be segmented semantically by setting an appropriate threshold for pixel values using all R, G, B, and NIR wavelengths.

In addition, a classification method using a machine learning model with element concentration and heat treatment temperature as parameters was presented in the paper. However, these methods are limited in their application to everyday products, such as kitchenware and cookware, due to the need for reagents, specialized equipment, or reliance on professional services.

RL-based Control of Smart Base Isolation System Using Unity ML-Agents,2024,['Reinforcement learning · Smart base isolation system · Deep Q-network · Unity ML-agents · Smart control algorithm'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been used in the development of various control systems presenting desirable control performances.There have been many studies examining the development of structural control algorithms using conventional methods and soft computing algorithms. However, research investigating RL-based structural control techniques in particular is still in an early stage. In RL algorithms, the agent interacts with the environment by taking the appropriate action under the specifi c state. In the RL-based structural control problem, the environment usually includes the structure, control system, external loads, etc., and it is generally presented by the fi nite element model. In the present study, the Unity game engine— which has recently come to be used in various engineering simulations because of its accurate physics calculations—was used to construct a reinforcement learning environment for structural control systems. A smart base isolation system (SBIS) that was composed of a magnetorheological damper and four friction pendulum systems was used as an example structural control system, and it was modeled using the Unity physics engine for RL environment. Among various RL algorithms, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) was used to make the control algorithm for the SBIS. The command voltage for the smart base isolation was mapped into the agent’s action. The reward of the DQN algorithm was designed to be a higher value when the agent takes a better action resulting in reduced seismic responses. Three artifi cial ground motions were used to train the DQN-based control algorithm, and another artifi cial earthquake was used to investigate the control effi ciency of the trained DQN-based control algorithm. The passive-on case with the maximum damper force was used for comparative study. This study shows that the DQN-based algorithm can successfully control the SBIS.

Notably, a significant portion of these visitors are unaware of swimming techniques or face other physical challenges, rendering them vulnerable to drowning, especially in areas lacking adequate lifeguard support or immediate medical emergency services. This study introduces an advanced drowneddetection device that employs a deep learning algorithm, grounded in artificial intelligence architecture, to swiftly detect and address potential drowning incidents. The system is particularly vigilant towards high-risk groups, such as children and the elderly. Upon detecting a threat, it autonomously deploys drones equipped with inflatable rescue tubes and notifies local authorities. Preliminary results suggest that our proposed model can effectively rescue a drowning individual in under 7 min, highlighting its prospective utility in curtailing swimming-related fatalities worldwide. This research underscores the need for technological intervention to enhance safety measures at coastal destinations and seeks to raise awareness about the importance of well-established lifeguard support."

LLIE methods based on deep learning show good performance. However, there are some limitations to these methods, such as the complex network model requires highly configurable environments, and deficient enhancement of edge details leads to blurring of the target content. Single-scale feature extraction results in the insufficient recovery of the hidden content of the enhanced images. This paper proposed an edge detection-based multi-scale feature enhancement network for LLIE (EDMFEN). To reduce the loss of edge details in the enhanced images, an edge extraction module consisting of a Sobel operator is introduced to obtain edge information by computing gradients of images. In addition, a multi-scale feature enhancement module (MSFEM) consisting of multi-scale feature extraction block (MSFEB) and a spatial attention mechanism is proposed to thoroughly recover the hidden content of the enhanced images and obtain richer features. Since the fused features may contain some useless information, the MSFEB is introduced so as to obtain the image features with different perceptual fields. To use the multi-scale features more effectively, a spatial attention mechanism module is used to retain the key features and improve the model performance after fusing multi-scale features. Experimental results on two datasets and five baseline datasets show that EDMFEN has good performance when compared with the state-of-the-art LLIE methods."

The significance of plant growth stress induced by environmental variables, including temperature, light, nutrient deficiencies, and water supply were addressed and the conventional stress detection methodologies, underscores their inherent limitations, and establishes the groundwork for the exploration of state-of-the-art technologies in stress assessment. Various sensor technologies were explored, encompassing traditional RGB cameras, multispectral and hyperspectral sensors, and thermal imaging, each capable of capturing distinct stress signatures. Machine vision, leveraging high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, offers detailed insights into plant physiological responses. Coupled with AI approaches such as deep learning, neural networks, and pattern recognition, machine vision enables the automated analysis of vast datasets, enhancing the accuracy and speed of stress detection. The recent advancements in image processing techniques tailored for plant stress identification were focused and discussed the role of feature extraction, classification, and predictive modelling in achieving robust results. The potentials of AI in plant stress physiology and its role in overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, and the use of unsupervised identification of visual symptoms to quantify stress severity, allowing for the identification of different types of plant stress were studied. Moreover, the potentials of machine vision technology and AI for real-time monitoring and decision support systems in precision agriculture were discussed. The findings of this review would contribute to the growing field of agricultural technology, offering insights into the development of automated tools that could aid farmers and researchers in mitigating the impact of abiotic stressors on crop/plant health and productivity."
Depth Anything을 활용한 실시간 영상 변환,2024,"['Computer Vision', 'Image Processing', 'Foreground', 'Background', 'Depth Estimation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled its application to real-world scenarios, yet many deep learning models face challenges in real-time processing due to high computational demands. This study proposes a method for real-time image transformation that emphasizes the boundary between foreground and background while addressing these limitations. The proposed approach utilizes the Depth Anything model to generate a depth-based background image and identify the Region of Interest (RoI) from the input image using GPU. Subsequently, the RGB input image is transformed into HSV color space, and a final image is created by combining the value channel, an inverted saturation channel, and the depth background image. Once the depth background is initialized, subsequent image trans formations can be performed in real-time on a CPU. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method highlights foreground-background boundaries comparably to Depth Anything while sig nificantly reducing computational overhead. The method is particularly effective for video monitoring applications with static cameras, ensuring computational efficiency and robustness."

In Korea, the one-dimensional consolidation theory is applied during the design phase, and measurement-based prediction techniques (e.g., the hyperbolic method) are employed during the construction phase. However, these methods are limited because they may not fully reflect the site-specific characteristics or require long-term monitoring. Thus, in this study, ensemble-based deep learning models (i.e., the random forest, gradient boosting machine, XGBoost, and LightGBM models) were developed using the final fill height and ground information to improve the accuracy of the final settlement predictions and analyze the correlations with the input variables. In addition, a database was constructed from the measurement results and borehole data collected from six sites in Busan Port. The prediction results demonstrate that the random forest model achieved the highest accuracy with an average mean absolute error of 0.51 m and a mean absolute percentage error of 8.38%. In addition, the other models demonstrated high performance within specific data distributions; however, they tended to exhibit increased prediction errors when encountering out-of-distribution data.

Signal Augmentation Method based on Mixing and Adversarial Training for Better Robustness and Generalization,2024,"['Adversarial training', 'automatic modulation recognition', 'data augmentation', 'mixing signals', 'robustnes']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"More and more deep learning methods have been applied to wireless communication systems. However, the collection of authentic signal data poses challenges. Moreover, due to the vulnerability of neural networks, adversarial attacks seriously threaten the security of communication systems based on deep learning models. Traditional signal augmentation methods expand the dataset through transformations such as rotation and flip, but these methods improve the adversarial robustness of the model little. However, common methods to improve adversarial robustness such as adversarial training not only have a high computational overhead but also potentially lead to a decrease in accuracy on clean samples. In this work, we propose a signal augmentation method called Adversarial and Mixed-based Signal Augmentation (AMSA). The method can improve the adversarial robustness of the model while expanding the dataset and does not compromise the generalization ability. It combines adversarial training with data mixing and then interpolates selected pairs of samples to form new samples in an expanded dataset consisting of original and adversarial samples thus generating more diverse data. We conduct experiments on the RML2016.10a and RML2018.01a datasets using automatic modulation recognition (AMR) models based on CNN, LSTM, CLDNN, and Transformer. And compare the performance in scenarios with different numbers of samples. The results show that AMSA allows the model to achieve comparable or even better adversarial robustness than using adversarial training, and reduces the degradation of the model's generalization performance on clean data."

Agricultural products are essential for human survival and have a direct impact, making this a highly sensitive issue. This problem has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war, leading to even greater price hikes. Consequently, this situation places a considerable burden not only on consumers but also on the companies that process and produce these agricultural products. In particular, South Korea, a country with a high dependency on imports, relies on foreign markets for many agricultural products. However, despite this reliance, there is a lack of research on predicting the prices of imported agricultural products. For this reason, this study implements an AI model that predicts the retail prices of final products based on fluctuations in the prices of imported agricultural products, focusing on key research questions (RQs) and the distribution process. In addition, it examines the impact of global issues such as supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19 and the Ukraine-Russia war on price inflation.In this study, the top three imported agricultural products―corn, wheat, and soybeans―are selected as key imported agricultural items, and the prediction model is implemented focusing on the processed foods most commonly consumed in daily life that are manufactured from these products. At this time, key variables are added by taking into account the distribution and manufacturing processes involved in the processing of agricultural products.Specifically, the relationships between these variables are analyzed through correlation analysis, and a prediction model is implemented using big data analysis to select the model with the highest prediction accuracy. In this study, the VAR model showed the highest prediction accuracy among machine learning models, while the LSTM model demonstrated the highest accuracy among deep learning models.In conclusion, the academic implications of this study demonstrate that the impact of the international commodity market and global trade on the production and distribution of domestic companies can be scientifically analyzed and proposed through AI models. Additionally, the study systematically identified and explained the raw material supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic from an academic perspective. Furthermore, the practical implications of this study for companies are significant. By utilizing this research, companies can identify how price fluctuations in imported agricultural products affect the pricing of final products. It allows them to proactively respond to changes in the prices of final products by applying the forecasting model. Additionally, companies can confirm the relationship between the prices of imported agricultural products and the retail prices of final products, gaining a clearer understanding of the costs incurred during domestic and international distribution processes.

Similar Image Retrieval Technique based on Semantics through Automatic Labeling Extraction of Personalized Images,2024,"['CBIR', 'Image Retrieval', 'Deep Learning', 'CNN', 'Feature Detect', 'etc.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Despite the rapid strides in content-based image retrieval, a notable disparity persists between the visual features of images and the semantic features discerned by humans. Hence, image retrieval based on the association of semantic similarities recognized by humans with visual similarities is a difficult task for most image-retrieval systems. Our study endeavors to bridge this gap by refining image semantics, aligning them more closely with human perception. Deep learning techniques are used to semantically classify images and retrieve those that are semantically similar to personalized images. Moreover, we introduce a keyword-based image retrieval, enabling automatic labeling of images in mobile environments.

In the medical field, the impact of AI spans from diagnostics and treatment recommendations to patient engagement and monitoring, considerably improving efficiency and outcomes. The clinical integration of AI has also been examined in specialties, including pathology, radiology, and oncology. General surgery primarily involves manual manipulation and includes preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care, all of which are critical for saving lives. Other fields have strived to utilize and adopt AI; nonetheless, general surgery appears to have retrogressed. In this review, we analyzed the published research, to understand how the application of AI in general surgery differs from that in other medical fields. Based on previous research in other fields, the application of AI in the preoperative stage is nearing feasibility. Ongoing research efforts aim to utilize AI to improve and predict operative outcomes, enhance performance, and improve patient care. However, the use of AI in the operating room remains significantly understudied. Moreover, ethical responsibilities are associated with such research, necessitating extensive work to gather evidence. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and leveraging lessons from AI success stories in other fields, AI tools could be specifically tailored for general surgery. Surgeons should be prepared for the integration of AI into clinical practice to achieve better outcomes; therefore, the time has come to consider ethical and legal implications."

Therefore, we propose for the first time the use of an adversarial domain adaptation network (LSTM-DA, Long Short-Term Memory domain adaptation) to extract battery monitoring data and obtain the mapping relationship of the battery charge state. The model is first pretrained using the source domain data. Then, the feature extractor and domain discriminator are made to form an adversarial relationship through the gradient reversal layer (GRL). The simultaneous max–min operation allows the model to be trained for adversarial domain adaptation using source and target domain data. In this study, offline training and online prediction scenarios under incomplete discharge cycles are simulated using Panasonic and LG datasets, and the mean absolute error and root mean square error values of the estimation results on the target domain are 4.71% and 6.59%, respectively. The estimation accuracies under sparse sample conditions are higher than the existing benchmarks of deep learning methods and migration learning methods."

Our proposed method is a variation of the Split-Transform-Merge (STM) strategy, widely employed in the existing deep learning image classification domain, adapted universally to the Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) domain. The primary aim of our technique is to enhance depth estimation performance. Traditionally, there were two tasks in this domain: regression, which involves inputting and outputting a single image into the network, and classification, which predefined discretized depth value classes (Bins). The classification task aimed to obtain the Bins probability value for each pixel as the network output. However, a paradigm shift has shifted from predefined Bins to adaptive Bins technology. This technology allows learning by adding a Bins estimation module to the final network output. Recent research has focused on various types of Bins estimation modules to achieve more accurate adaptive Bins estimation. One limitation arises when high-dimensional feature map representations are input to the Bins estimation module. These representations are projected and input as low-dimensional feature map representations, inevitably leading to information loss. We propose a novel Split-Transform-Conversion-Merge (STCM) strategy to address these limitations. This strategy delves deep into the relationship between feature map representations and Bins estimation modules, thereby improving the boundaries of information loss. To validate the performance of our proposed strategy, we applied it to various MDE techniques, observing significant improvements in performance across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, we noted enhanced visual performance in our experiments."

However, in practical application scenarios, small-sized target defects pose a great challenge to the detection accuracy of existing mainstream deep learning detection networks with limited perceptual felds. To solve the above problems, the paper proposes a detection model of YOLOv5 transmission line inspection image. Firstly, the key target images under diferent backgrounds and attitudes are collected and preprocessed.Specifcally, in order to improve the perception ability of networks for small-sized targets, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to optimize the size of the anchor box, which efectively improves the ftting ability of the key target features. Then, recursive gated convolution is used as the backbone network to improve the ability to extract key target features. Finally, considering the concealment of small-scale features, the space-to-depth convolution module is added to the neck network to realize down-sampling and retain all the information in the channel dimension. In addition, a feature prediction layer is added to optimize the scale of network detection, and a Simple Parameter-Free Attention Module is added to further optimize the characterization of network features. The experimental results show that the accuracy and recall of the proposed network are 96.8% and 93.3%, respectively. The average detection accuracy reaches 97.1%, which is 3.8% higher than that of YOLOv5 network, 5.2% higher than YOLOv6 and 1.0% higher than that of YOLOv7 network.

Emotion was chosen as the core metric for this quantitative analysis. By combining YOLOv5 object detection technology with deep learning, we precisely measured the emotional values of characters in the films and plotted their emotional curves. The results showed significant differences in the average emotions and standard deviations among religious films of different factions. By observing the emotional curve, we found that religious films, especially those with Christian themes, exhibit a unique trajectory of emotions. The sentiment tends to rise at the beginning of the film, followed by repeated fluctuations, and eventually reaching a climax.

It resembles the functions of a biologꠓical brain, enabling energy-efficient and real-time processing. Despite being hardware-friendly, SNNs still require considerable computational resources. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Spiking Neural Network (CSNN) architecture that leverages a preprocessed dataset for hardware accelerator-based pruning to reduce latency and power consumption. The dataset is encoded as binary data and preprocessed on the front-end by sorting it based on patterns. Once the dataset is input into the hardware accelerator, the system identifies data that does not require convolution operations. This allows the removal of inactive neurons at the Register Transfer Level (RTL). Since the neurons to be removed follow a similar pattern to the pruned neurons in the previous time step, the cost of removal is almost negligible. By pruning neurons dynamically for each input image, a more efficient, high-speed, low-power hardware accelerator can be achieved. The pattern-based dataset classification was implemented in Python, while the hardware accelerator was developed using Verilog and synthesized on an FPGA. This approach reduces power consumption by 80.02%, while also requiring 7.27% fewer gates and achieving a 90.1% improvement compared to traditional convolutional spiking neural networks and conventional CNNs. The accuracy reaches 90.56% and each input is calculated in 8955 clock cycles, which takes 0.53s for 60000 images in 100MHz board. This approach demonstrates the potential for enabling real-time learning on NPUs by integrating learning accelerators in future applications."

SSF can provide additional forensic evidence through laboratory tests such as diatom and electrolyte analyses. If drowning is suspected, accurately assessing the presence and volume of SSF during an autopsy is crucial. Utilizing postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) images could aid in accurately sampling SSF. Accurately segmenting the region of interest is essential for volume analysis using computed tomography images. However, manual segmentation techniques are labor-intensive and time-consuming, and their success depends on the experience of the observer. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a U-Net–based deep learning model for the automatic segmentation of SSF in drowning cases using PMCT images and to evaluate the performance of the model. We retrospectively reviewed 34 drowning cases in which both PMCT scans and forensic autopsies were performed at our institution. The U-Net architecture of deep learning was used for automatic segmentation. The proposed model achieved the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU) of a maximum of 95.85% and 92.03%, a minimum of 0% and 0%, and an average of 77.15% and 67.18%, respectively. Although the average DSC and IoU did not show high similarity, this study showed that PMCT images can be used for automatic segmentation of SSF in drowning cases, which could improve the performance with sufficient dataset acquisition and further model training."

RNN-LSTM 기반의 순차적 문장 분류 모델,2024,"['RNN-LSTM', '텍스트마이닝', '딥러닝', '자연어처리', 'text mining', 'deep learning', 'natural language processing']","문장 분류(Text Classification)는 단어, 문장, 지문 등 텍스트가 특정 카테고리에 속하는지를 자동으로 분석하는 작업을 의미하며, 비정형 데이터 분석이다. 많은 연구자들이 딥러닝을 활용하여 텍스트 분류 문제를 해결하려고 시도하고 있으며 특히, 과거의 사건이 미래에 영향을 미치도록 설계한 LSTM은 텍스트 분류 문제에 효과적이다. 하지만 LSTM은 Time Steps 수, 즉 텍스트에 활용한 단어가 늘어날수록 성능이 떨어지는 한계가 있다. 이는 장기의존성 문제와는 별개로, 일반적으로 문장을 작성할 때 글의 핵심뿐만 아니라 의미 없는 문장도 함께 작성하기 때문이다. 본 연구에서는 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 ‘문장 단위의 학습 결과를 반영한 RNN-LSTM 기반의 순차적 문장 분류 모델’을 제안하였다. 해당 모델은 RNN을 통해 문장을 학습한 후, 다시 LSTM 알고리즘으로 재학습함으로써 긴 문서에서도 분류 정확도를 높였다.","Text classification refers to the task of automatically analyzing whether text, such as words, sentences, or fingerprints, belongs to a specific category, and is an unstructured data analysis. Many researchers are attempting to solve text classification problems using deep learning, and in particular, LSTM, which is designed to allow past events to influence the future, is effective in text classification problems. However, LSTM has a limitation in that its performance deteriorates as the number of Time Steps, that is, the number of words used in the text increases. This is because, apart from the long-term dependency problem, when writing a sentence, not only the core of the text but also meaningless sentences are also written. In this study, to solve this problem, we proposed a 'RNN-LSTM-based sequential sentence classification model that reflects sentence-level learning results.' The model improved classification accuracy even in long documents by learning sentences through RNN and then relearning them using the LSTM algorithm."

However, the data collected through such devices are limited by outliers and missing values owing to the anomalous and irregular characteristics of pets. Hence, we propose pet behavior recognition based on a hybrid one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short- term memory (LSTM) model using pet wearable devices. An Arduino-based pet wearable device was first fabricated to collect data for behavior recognition, where gyroscope and accelerometer values were collected using the device. Then, data augmentation was performed after replacing any missing values and outliers via preprocessing. At this time, the behaviors were classified into five types. To prevent bias from specific actions in the data augmentation, the number of datasets was compared and balanced, and CNN-LSTM-based deep learning was performed. The five subdivided behaviors and overall performance were then evaluated, and the overall accuracy of behavior recognition was found to be about 88.76%."

Signals from rotating and non-rotating equipment included in the Malfunctioning Industrial Machine Investigation and Inspection (MIMII) dataset were applied to a deep learning model. We applied unsupervised learning methods utilizing the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Domain Adaptation Neural Network (DANN). First, VAEs were utilized to diagnose the fault. The statistical features of the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) coefficients of the acoustic signal were utilized to extract features that can be used regardless of the length of the audio signal. Considering the characteristics of rotating equipment, feature enhancement was performed by applying Magnitude Spectral Subtraction and feature lightweight, and data augmentation was performed by utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on the extracted features. Although VAE can create a fault classifier using only steady-state data, improving and augmenting the features was necessary considering the characteristics of non-rotating and rotating equipment. The increased ambient noise reduced the accuracy, showing that VAE can accurately diagnose failures. The data used for training contains a domain shift between the laboratory environment and the actual operating environment, which represents a problem where a fault classifier trained on data from the laboratory environment may have poor diagnostic performance in the real world. To solve this problem, a Domain Adaptive Neural Network (DANN) was applied. DANN does not require additional data processing and can utilize labels from the source domain to diagnose faults in the target domain. By utilizing the advantages of the above two methods, we showed that fault diagnosis can be adapted even if the environment of a given equipment changes by combining the procedures according to the noise situation."

The primary objective of the research is to understand user satisfaction with OTT service platforms and contribute to the formulation of more effective review strategies. The key questions addressed in this study involve identifying prominent topics and keywords in user reviews of different OTT services and comprehending platform-specific user reactions. TF-IDF is utilized to extract significant words from positive and negative reviews, while BERTopic, an advanced topic modeling technique, is employed for a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of intricate user reviews. The results from TF-IDF analysis reveal that positive app reviews exhibit a high frequency of content-related words, whereas negative reviews display a high frequency of words associated with potential issues during app usage. Through the utilization of BERTopic, we were able to extract keywords related to content diversity, app performance components, payment, and compatibility, by associating them with content attributes. This enabled us to verify that the distinguishing attributes of the platforms vary among themselves. The findings of this study offer significant insights into user behavior and preferences, which OTT service providers can leverage to improve user experience and satisfaction. We also anticipate that researchers exploring deep learning models will find our study results valuable for conducting analyses on user review text data."

In electromagnetic warfare, analyzing the radar signals of hostile forces is a crucial activity to gain superiority. Particularly, the technique to classify modulation schemes of radar signals collected without prior information plays a vital role in enabling friendly forces to identify the presence of threats and obtain valuable intelligence. For radar signal modulation classification, the use of binary time-frequency image (TFI) has the advantage of improving system memory efficiency over grayscale TFI, but with the drawback of image pattern distortion during binarization. This paper proposes a novel binary TFI generation method that reduces pattern distortion. To achieve this, we first generate a grayscale TFI of the received radar signal, then reduce the noise in the image by extracting the frequency component-related information through temporal marginalization of the grayscale TFI. Subsequently, the noise-reduced image is standardized and clipped along the frequency axis for pattern enhancement, followed by global thresholding for binarization. Through computer simulations, we show that the binary TFI generated with the proposed method can effectively classify 37 single and composite radar modulation schemes. Furthermore, we verify that for various deep learning models, the proposed method shows better classification performance than the binary TFIs generated using conventional methods."

In this paper, we propose a wavelet transform-based CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model, namely the WT-DnCNN(Wavelet Transform-Denoising Convolutional Neural Network) model, to improve noise removal performance. This model first removes noise by dividing the noisy image into frequency bands using wavelet transform, and then applies the existing DnCNN model to the corresponding frequency bands to finally remove noise. In order to evaluate the performance of the WT-DnCNN model proposed in this paper, experiments were conducted on MRI and CT images damaged by various noises, namely Gaussian noise, Poisson noise, and speckle noise. The performance experiment results show that the WT-DnCNN model is superior to the traditional filter, i.e., the BM3D(Block-Matching and 3D Filtering) filter, as well as the existing deep learning models, DnCNN and CDAE(Convolution Denoising AutoEncoder) model in qualitative comparison, and in quantitative comparison, the PSNR(Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM(Structural Similarity Index Measure) values were 36~43 and 0.93~0.98 for MRI images and 38~43 and 0.95~0.98 for CT images, respectively. In addition, in the comparison of the execution speed of the models, the DnCNN model was much less than the BM3D model, but it took a long time due to the addition of the wavelet transform in the comparison with the DnCNN model."
A Prospective Technique for Damage Detection in Truss Structures Using the Fusion of DNN with AVOA,2024,"['Structural health monitoring', 'Damage detection', 'African vulture optimization algorithm', 'Deep neural network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In recent decades, the integration of optimization methods and Machine Learning (ML) models has garnered significant attention within the research community. In the pursuit of establishing a symbiotic relationship between ML and optimization algorithms, this study focuses on the fusion of the African Vulture Optimization Algorithm (AVOA) - an optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of African vultures - with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) - a prevalent model in ML for damage detection of a real large-scale bridge. In this research, AVOA, possessing a vast search space and the ability to autonomously adjust crucial parameters during the search process, such as flight velocity and learning rate, is employed to select informative features such as weight and biases of DNNs. This synergy allows the network to automatically adjust its potential. The technique is applied to a truss bridge, utilizing Finite Element Model (FEM) data that has been validated by real-world vibration measurements, resulting in precise damage identification even in the presence of white Gaussian noise. Evaluation criteria demonstrate enhanced accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the traditional neural network approach."

Performance evaluation of rainfall prediction was performed by the lead time according to the rainfall threshold using CSI(Critical success index), RMSE(Root Mean Square Error). As a result of the study, it was confirmed that the overall RMSE of the U-Net++ model was lower than that of the U-Net model, and thed quantitative prediction performance of rainfall was improved. On the other hand, in the case of CSI, the existing U-Net model showed a higher value, showing excellent performance in predicting the occurrence of rainfall. However, both models showed a tendency to decrease CSI and increase RMSE as the threshold increased and the lead time increased. In addition, the areal rainfall in the Soyang river basin was compared using ground rainfall, radar data, U-Net model, and U-Net++ model. As a result of calculating cumulative areal rainfall every 10 minutes for a total of 8 rainfall events, the U-Net++ model tended to be slightly overestimated as the lead time increased, but it was shown to be superior to the U-Net model in the cumulative areal rainfall prediction performance up to 60 minutes. In particular, the U-Net++ model showed high similarity to ground rainfall and rainfall and radar data in events with relatively high rainfall, and the RMSE analysis also showed lower median and less variability, confirming excellent prediction performance."

Therefore, this study proposes a deep learning model that utilizes aerial imagery to classify forests and measure the corresponding carbon storage. Existing image-based object detection models have a large number of parameters and high computational costs; therefore, it is difficult to apply them in real-time services or in resource-constrained situations. To address this, the proposed model leverages the SegFormer architecture based on transformers to simultaneously achieve both lightweight design and classification accuracy. The proposed model experimentally demonstrated superior performance compared to existing algorithms on aerial images with a resolution of 25 cm per pixel. The findings of this study are expected to be effectively applied in future carbon storage prediction and monitoring efforts."

However, because it's nearly impossible to precisely estimate the lifespan ofeach building due to the wide range of influencing factors, most studies have used uniform lifespans based on the building's primarystructural type. To address this limitation, 1,812,700 records were analyzed of buildings constructed and demolished in Korea to predict eachbuilding's lifespan with greater accuracy. Based on the previous study, a prediction model was developed using both deep learning andtraditional machine learning methods. This study evaluated whether the building lifespan prediction model experienced overfitting based on thedata period used to create the model. A performance evaluation was also conducted, comparing models using only key factors to those usinga broader set of factors. The results showed that among the machine learning models, the artificial neural network model, a nonlinearapproach, maintained high predictive accuracy without overfitting, regardless of the data period used. The model that used all available factorsperformed better than those based on just a few key factors. This research demonstrates the viability of using big data and AI for buildinglifespan prediction, providing a more reliable method for estimating building lifespan tailored to each building's unique characteristics. Thisapproach meets a growing societal demand for more accurate building lifespan predictions."

Using this, the research trends by year were reviewed, and the number of research papers containing top topics increased significantly until the mid-2010s. However, the number of papers with subtopics varies over time. This can be explained by the presence of large sites and specific relics, the impact of the number of natural science analyses, and the introduction of new analytical methods. Next, the research trends by region were examined. Among the four top topics, ‘Settlement’ was mainly dealt with in Hoseo, ‘tomb’ was in Honam, ‘relic’ were in Yeongnam regions, and ‘chronology’ was mainly dealt with in China. It was understood as the result of the existence of remains and relics complexes concentrated in a specific area and the results of excavation surveys in the area. Regional comparisons were mainly conducted on domestic data. Specifically, the majority of papers are based on data from the Central, Hoseo, and Yeongnam regions, while only a few were from Jeju and Yeongdong regions. It was confirmed that a relatively large number of Chinese and North Korean data are handled in overseas regions.

Method: A model is presented that combines fall discrimination rules with the results inferred from YOLOv8-pose, one of the top-down pose estimation models, and metrics of the model are evaluated for images of standing and falling two or fewer workers in the tunnel. The same process is also conducted for a bottom-up type of pose estimation model (OpenPose). In addition, due to dependency of the falling interference of the models on worker detection by YOLOv8-pose and OpenPose, metrics of the models for fall was not only investigated, but also for person. Result: For worker detection, both YOLOv8-pose and OpenPose models have F1-score of 0.88 and 0.71, respectively. However, for fall detection, the metrics were deteriorated to 0.71 and 0.23. The results of the OpenPose based model were due to partially detected worker body, and detected workers but fail to part them correctly. Conclusion: Use of top-down type of pose estimation models would be more effective way to detect fall of workers in the underground utility tunnel, with respect to joint recognition and partition between workers."

However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of the echo signal due to multipath propagation of the signal, various clutter, ambient noise and reverberation makes it difficult to identify underwater targets using active sonar. Attempts have been made to apply data-based methods such as machine learning or deep learning to improve the performance of underwater target recognition systems, but it is difficult to collect enough data for training due to the nature of sonar datasets. Methods based on mathematical modeling have been mainly used to compensate for insufficient active sonar data. However, methodologies based on mathematical modeling have limitations in accurately simulating complex underwater phenomena. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a sonar signal synthesis method based on a deep neural network. In order to apply the neural network model to the field of sonar signal synthesis, the proposed method appropriately corrects the attention-based encoder and decoder to the sonar signal, which is the main module of the Tacotron model mainly used in the field of speech synthesis. It is possible to synthesize a signal more similar to the actual signal by training the proposed model using the dataset collected by arranging a simulated target in an actual marine environment.

These results prove that the active sonar signal generated by the proposed method approximates the actual signal."

Sports analytics can be broadly categorized into on-field analytics and off-field analytics. Calls for systematic research identifying the current status of the sports analytics field are prevailing. However, it is difficult to find a study that systematically reviews sports analytics research that sheds light on the present and future of the field. In response to such research needs, the objective of this research is to conduct a systematic review on sports analytics presenting discourses on the future direction of the sports analytics field. This study collected all sports analytics-related studies published in domestic listed journals by utilizing various keywords such as “sports analytics,” “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” “data analysis,” and “sports analytics” in DBpia, Google Scholar, and Kyobo Scholar. We then systematically categorized the sports analytics studies that met the purpose of this study based on the consensus of three professional experts. As a result of the analysis, a total of 29 studies were found that analyzed actual match data, 23 studies analyzed discourse and trends, and 17 studies presented methodologies. In particular, the systematic categorization of studies that analyzed actual game data revealed that 1) the sports studied were heavily biased toward baseball and basketball, and 2) most of the studies were conducted only at the player and team level. Another limitation is that 3) the goal of the studies using AI algorithms is limited to predicting game outcomes or performance. Finally, 4) we found that more studies analyzing actual game data were published in non-sports journals than in sports-related journals. Based on these findings, this study systematically established and discussed eight recommendations. The significance of this study is that it examines the current status of sports analytics research and suggests the direction in which domestic sports industry and management-related research should move forward from the perspective of sports analytics."

To defend against such attacks, Network Intrusion Detection System(NIDS), which detects abnormal patterns or activities by monitoring network traffic, has emerged. Especially, NIDS using a graph structure has been actively studied because it can effectively represent and analyze complex structures in a wireless network. In this paper, we proposed a novel graph generation algorithm based on multi-sessionization. The proposed graph generation algorithm combines three sessionization methods to convert captured network packets into a graph structure. In addition, from evaluation results using AWID3 dataset, we show that the proposed graph generation algorithm can provide a high detection accuracy when it is applied to various deep learning models."

Die Forderungen nach Transparenz und Vorhersehbarkeit werden bei Algorithmen, die den Kern der künstlichen Intelligenz bilden, zunehmen, und da die Forderungen nach erklärbarer künstlicher Intelligenz proportional zunehmen, werden diesbezüglich spezifische detaillierte Standards vorbereitet. Darüber hinaus erhöht ein solches Lernen in Bezug auf Deep Learning sowie maschinelles Lernen als Lernwerkzeug in der künstlichen Intelligenz die Undurchsichtigkeit des Entscheidungsmechanismus der künstlichen Intelligenz und fordert dementsprechend das Recht der anderen Partei, Erklärungen zu verlangen oder sich daran zu beteiligen.In Korea werden viele Gesetze im Zusammenhang mit künstlicher Intelligenz vorgeschlagen, um zu versuchen, die künstliche Intelligenz selbst zu regulieren, und werden in Zukunft gesetzlich erlassen.

Recovering audio distortion requires the use of sophisticated methods that are capable of effectively managing its diversity, complexity, and unpredictable nature. This paper proposes the Variational U-Net neural network, which combines the probabilistic modeling capabilities of variational inference with the strengths of the Wave U-Net neural network in terms of preserving spatial and temporal information during reconstruction. Through variational inference, the model efficiently captures the distribution of clean audio signals, thus facilitating the probabilistic generation of audio affected by various distortions. Simultaneously, the adaptation of the Wave U-Net structure to our model ensures that valid audio details are preserved, thus enhancing the quality of the restored signal. The proposed method was rigorously evaluated using the Audio MNIST dataset, which simulates real-world audio distortion scenarios in a controlled environment. The proposed method’s performance was compared against four state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, and the proposed method ultimately demonstrated a significant improvement of +4.0dB in SI-SDR compared to other methods."

After analyzing the skin type and detailed skin features of each area, a self-care program was proposed. A total of eight skin analysis items were measured, including skin type, pores, elasticity, pigmentation, UV pigmentation, sebum, porphyrin, and moisture.(Findings) The sebum secretion was categorized into oily, dry, and neutral, and the moisture secretion was categorized into hydrated, dehydrated, and hydrated. When analyzing the pore area ratio it was found that more cases were above the average for their age group, which is related to the fact that the skin type is more oily than dry. When analyzing the elasticity area ratio, it was found that more people were below the average for their age group, and 39.4% needed elasticity care above the average for their age group. The pigmentation area ratio shows that the highest percentage of people below the age group average is 54.5%, while the UV pigmentation area ratio is very high at 78.8% above the age group average. The porphyrin ratio was 66.7% above the age group average, which is believed to be due to more oily skin type subjects.(Research implications or Originality) The balance of oil and moisture is crucial for the skin to remain healthy and beautiful through its protective functions. For personalized skin care, it is important to accurately measure and diagnose the skin condition to analyze whether the oil-water balance is appropriate, and to identify pores, elasticity, pigmentation, sebum and water secretion. Compared to other ages, people in their 20s should focus on preventive skin care.

By utilizing an AI-based digital skin analysis system that applies big data, deep learning technology, and skin analysis algorithms, it will be possible to manage skin health more effectively."
Approach to diagnosing multiple abnormal events with single-event training data,2024,"['Nuclear power plant', 'Abnormal event diagnosis', 'Multi-label classification', 'Feature selection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Diagnostic support systems are being researched to assist operators in identifying and responding to abnormal events in a nuclear power plant. Most studies to date have considered single abnormal events only, for which it is relatively straightforward to obtain data to train the deep learning model of the diagnostic support system. However, cases in which multiple abnormal events occur must also be considered, for which obtaining training data becomes difficult due to the large number of combinations of possible abnormal events. This study proposes an approach to maintain diagnostic performance for multiple abnormal events by training a deep learning model with data on single abnormal events only. The proposed approach is applied to an existing algorithm that can perform feature selection and multi-label classification. We choose an extremely randomized trees classifier to select dedicated monitoring parameters for target abnormal events. In diagnosing each event occurrence independently, two-channel convolutional neural networks are employed as sub-models. The algorithm was tested in a case study with various scenarios, including single and multiple abnormal events. Results demonstrated that the proposed approach maintained diagnostic performance for 15 single abnormal events and significantly improved performance for 105 multiple abnormal events compared to the base model."

An improved fuzzy c-means method based on multivariate skew-normal distribution for brain MR image segmentation,2024,"['Multivariate skew-normal distribution', 'Fuzzy C-Means(FCM)', 'KL divergence', 'U-Net', 'Brain MR images.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Accurate segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for providing doctors with effective quantitative information for diagnosis. However, the presence of weak boundaries, intensity inhomogeneity, and noise in the images poses challenges for segmentation models to achieve optimal results. While deep learning models can offer relatively accurate results, the scarcity of labeled medical imaging data increases the risk of overfitting. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel fuzzy c-means (FCM) model that integrates a deep learning approach. To address the limited accuracy of traditional FCM models, which employ Euclidean distance as a distance measure, we introduce a measurement function based on the skewed normal distribution. This function enables us to capture more precise information about the distribution of the image. Additionally, we construct a regularization term based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of high-confidence deep learning results. This regularization term helps enhance the final segmentation accuracy of the model. Moreover, we incorporate orthogonal basis functions to estimate the bias field and integrate it into the improved FCM method. This integration allows our method to simultaneously segment the image and estimate the bias field. The experimental results on both simulated and real brain MR images demonstrate the robustness of our method, highlighting its superiority over other advanced segmentation algorithms."

Microplastics can be detected by applying deep learning models to segment microscopic images. While it is important to avoid downsampling the data to improve accuracy, this usually requires an increase in model parameters and computation, making it difficult to operate in real-time on mobile devices. Therefore, to apply deep learning models to the process of instant microplastic detection from samplescollected in the field using mobile devices, a lightweight model is required while maintaining the resolution of the data. For the model lightweight experiment, we applied various existing lightweight methods to the convolution layer of U-Net, a representative model in the image segmentation field, and compared its performance with U-Net. The Depthwise Separable convolution layer shows mIoU performance that is comparable to that of U-Net, with 82.6% less computation. In addition, the Matrix Factorization and Group convolution layers show 99.55% less computation, although there is a 7.41% mIoU performance drop compared to U-Net.

Taking advantage of this point, security experts recommend that could develop APT attack detection solutions for each of their life cycles and processes.

Therefore, it is necessary to research and deploy technology and solutions that could detect early the APT attack when it is in the stages of attacking and stealing data. This paper proposes an APT attack detection framework based on the Network traffic analysis technique using open-source tools and deep learning models. This research focuses on analyzing Network traffic into different components, then finds ways to extract abnormal behaviors on those components, and finally uses deep learning algorithms to classify Network traffic based on the extracted abnormal behaviors. The abnormal behavior analysis process is presented in detail in section III.A of the paper. The APT attack detection method based on Network traffic is presented in section III.B of this paper.

As deep learning technology has become widely disseminated, access to deepfake technology has increased, resulting in a rise in crimes exploiting it. Consequently, there is a growing need for effective deepfake detection technologies. Deepfake generation primarily occurs through two methods: identity swap and facial reenactment. Existing detection technologies exhibit performance variations depending on the method of deepfake generation. This study aims to propose a research approach that addresses the limitations of existing methodologies by reducing the performance disparity of deepfake detection models. The proposed model first cuts a video into frame-by-frame images, then extracts the face area, which is the main target of deepfakes, and the mouth area, which can be considered a type of local information, and utilizes them as multi-scale features. By inputting each feature into different vision transformer structures and integrating the resulting predictions, the model effectively determines whether a video is a deepfake. Specifically, the face area helps address identity swap deepfakes, while the mouth area assists in handling facial reenactment deepfakes, thereby endowing the model with robustness against different deepfake generation methods. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the proposed method’s relatively high detection performance and its potential for more generalizable response to various deepfake generation methods."

This paper provides a comprehensive review of satellite remote sensing-based methane detection technologies used to efficiently detect and quantify methane emissions. Methane emission sources are broadly categorized into natural sources (such as permafrost and wetlands) and anthropogenic sources (such as agriculture, coal mines, oil and gas fields, and landfills). This study focuses on anthropogenic sources and examines the principles of methane detection using information from various spectral bands, including the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band, and the utilization of key satellite data supporting these technologies. Recently, deep learning techniques have been applied in methane detection research using satellite data, contributing to more accurate analyses of methane emissions. Furthermore, this paper assesses the practicality of satellite-based methane monitoring by synthesizing case studies of methane emission detection at global, regional, and major incident scales, including examples of applying deep learning techniques. At the global scale, research utilizing satellite sensors like the Sentinel-5P TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) was reviewed. At the regional scale, studies were highlighted where TROPOMI data was combined with relatively high-resolution satellite data, such as the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and GHGSat Wide-Angle Fabry-Perot (WAF-P) Imaging Spectrometer, to detect methane emissions and sources. Through this comprehensive review, the current state and applicability of satellite-based methane detection technologies are evaluated."

With the growing availability of diverse trajectory data and advancements in deep learning methodologies, research has focused on detecting anomalies in vehicles, aircraft, and ships. While previous studies emphasized the morphological similarity of trajectories, recent work has shown promising results by leveraging deep learning models, such as Variational Autoencoders(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs), using features extracted from trajectories, including velocity and direction. Although there have been studies on anomaly detection in vehicle and ship trajectories, anomaly detection in pedestrian trajectories has been limited due to challenges in data collection. Existing analyses often rely on small-scale indoor trajectory data or short CCTV video extracts, which do not adequately represent patterns on roads and lack comprehensive spatiotemporal characteristics. This study proposes an anomaly detection architecture based on pedestrian trajectories collected every second over one week from 16 CCTV cameras. The architecture consists of data transformation module, reconstruction module, and anomaly detection module, with the reconstruction module employing a Variational Autoencoder(VAE). To capture the temporal characteristics of the trajectories, the encoder and decoder are implemented using Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) networks. A heuristic labeling method was applied to construct a validation dataset for model performance evaluation, achieving an accuracy of 95.2%. The final model was applied to the full dataset to identify temporal and spatial patterns where anomalies frequently occur."

In this situation, the ability to accurately predict the possibility of personal credit loan default is becoming important, and this study aims to predict default using standardized credit information data. Various approaches have been attempted in personal credit loan default prediction research, from statistical methods to machine learning, and recently, deep learning methods such as multilayer perceptron have been applied. However, multilayer perceptron does not reflect contextual information between input variables, so it does not show improvement in prediction performance compared to existing machine learning methods. In this study, in order to overcome the shortcomings of the existing multilayer perceptron methodology, the Transformer methodology, which is mainly used in the natural language processing field, was applied to the problem of personal credit loan default prediction, and as a result, it was confirmed that it showed an improvement in prediction performance compared to the existing deep learning and showed the same level of prediction performance as the XGBoost methodology, an ensemble-based decision tree with the best prediction performance among previous methods. The implication of this study is that the Transformer methodology, which is mainly used in natural language processing, can be effective in the problem of predicting personal credit loan defaults using tabular data consisting of various variables. This suggests that, compared to existing traditional modeling techniques, Transformer can better capture complex interactions between high-dimensional data and improve prediction performance. This shows that the Transformer model has the potential to expand its application range in various prediction problems in the financial field."

It is analyzed and suggested that the Buddhist system of thinking in the Samje Weonyung(三諦圓融) is in close contact with the ideology of the Tao Te Ching and the Bayes Theorem, one of the learning algorithms of artificial intelligence. This is an attempt to explore the convergent implications of the Buddhist way of thinking inherent in the scriptures represented by Yeosiamun(如是我聞), that is to say, from the current perspective, it is an attempt to reconstruct the view of the Hearing(聞) of Yeosiamun(如是我聞) into the wheel of the dharmacakra-pravartana(如是我轉) in line with the innovation of modern science and technology, as well as to reveal the strategic value of the Middle Path with the manifestation of Yeosiajeon(如是我顯).Based on those recognition, this study newly present the strategic value of the Buddhist thinking system from two perspectives. First, by revealing that in light of Chapter 1 of the Tao Te Ching, the Tao(道) is referred to as having the characteristics of Ga(可), and it is clarified that Tao's properties are variable, and that Tao operates as a significant interdependence between Mu(無) as a potential world and Yu(有) as a phenomenal world. In this way, it is judged that the principle of operation of Tao(道), which works as an interdependence between Mu(無) and Yu(有), can be easily passed on as a thinking system of the Samje Weonyung(三諦圓融). Tao(道) is defined as a Ga(可), that is, change itself, which is equivalent to the principle of Muwi-MuBulwi(無爲無不爲). It is reasonable to estimate that it also can be interpreted as the three principles of the Middle Path that play a major rule as a strategic framework for the Buddhist thinking system.Second, Bays Theorem, one of the AI algorithms defined as another consciousness, is also a decision-making theory that abandons subjectivity and moves toward objectivity, not just a computer operating system. It has been shown that the process can be subsumed into the three principles of the Middle Path in that it is a learning method that constantly modifies the intellectual system of consciousness based on observation, data, and events. The reasoning of this paper is that the prior probability of Bays Theorem can be represented as a framework for divided thinking, and that the total probability can be determined as a Gong(空), the likelihood probability as a Ga(假), and the posterior probability as a Jung(中). It can be said that it is a process of dismantling the discriminated cognition system caused by the fixed frame and fringe limitations through Gong(空), presenting an updated direction based on this, and realizing the Middle Path. It can be confirmed that the same mechanism of operation as AI's deep learning and reinforcement learning methods interact with the Middle Path thinking system."

The advent of ChatGPT has particularly spurred interest in generative AI. This paper explores the current state of image generation AI, a subset of generative AI, and its applicability in game production.

We analyzed the applicability of these models across six different fields based on the image they generate. Additionally, we conducted a survey to evaluate each AI model from an objective and multifaceted perspective. The analysis revealed that the NovelAI Image Generation model excels in producing animation style artwork, while the Nijijourney and Midjourney models performed better in other cases. However, the study also identified significant challenges with image generation AI, such as copyright issues due to learning from existing artworks, inconsistent art styles, and difficulties in rendering complex and detailed elements.

The BDI, known for its significant volatility, has been the focus of several research initiatives utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches to improve accuracy. Nevertheless, these approaches frequently encounter difficulties in understanding the results of the predictions. This study provides a framework that utilizes the Distributed Lag Non-linear Model to enhance the predictive accuracy of the BDI. The proposed model has the capability of capturing lag effects based on different factors to improve the prediction results. To evaluate the efficacy of the suggested approach, we carried out comparison experiments utilizing four performance metrics that have been widely utilized in previous studies to compare with different machine learning and deep learning models. The results showed enhanced prediction accuracy in comparison with existing methodologies.

With technological advancements, it is developing into a form of predictive maintenance that uses AI techniques to diagnose failures and take proactive measures. In this paper, a study was conducted to diagnose fan motor failure in semiconductor chamber-type equipment, and a failure diagnosis method was studied using vibration signals using AI techniques through similar data sets. First, in previous research, failure was predicted using three models (DNN, RNN, CNN) using artificial intelligence deep learning techniques, and the four vibration signals were expanded to 19 through feature engineering to compare failure predictions using the same three models. Through analysis, the performance of the model algorithm was improved. In addition, most AI research studies failure diagnosis methodologies through batch-level time series data. Since semiconductor production sites are equipment that operates 24 hours a day, normal data is learned using streaming real-time data, and when abnormal data is detected, the autoencoder technique is used to classify it as a failure, to verify performance and diagnose failures. was studied. The implication of this study is that it is a step forward from research on improving algorithm performance using typical artificial intelligence techniques, and has progressed to improve performance through feature engineering. We visualized failure prediction by incorporating an autoencoder algorithm that can be actually applied in industrial sites, predicted anomaly scores by learning normal states, and analyzed the differences when abnormal data occurs to verify that failure prediction is possible. In addition, since abnormal data can be predicted using normal learning data, outliers can be graded by grade based on the maximum Anomaly Score of normal learning data. It can be used to implement a predictive maintenance system that can classify the maintenance status of facilities into normal operation, monitoring status, and maintenance status."

In the past, personal information was recognized as a subject to be protected through regulation rather than a subject to be promoted for the purpose of creating industrial added value. In addition, related laws were legislated in a way that controlled the distribution of data containing personal information in order to protect the privacy of citizens from infringements such as leakage, misuse, and abuse of personal information, and to guarantee the rights and interests of information subjects regarding personal information. In this way, personal information tended to be regulated as a subject of protection and control in existing related laws. However, now that generative AI has had a real impact on society as a general-purpose AI, a movement to recognize data as a property right is beginning, and interest is shifting to the development of various laws to return the added value obtained from the distribution of personal information to the information subjects and activate the actual use of data.Artificial intelligence technology is overcoming the second winter and undergoing technological evolution such as deep learning and generative AI. AlphaGo's victory in the past Go match against Lee Sedol briefly demonstrated the development of artificial intelligence technology and attracted the attention of many people, but AlphaGo's victory in the Go match did not directly lead to economic profit generation. Through this match, Google demonstrated the development of deep learning technology, and the world was amazed, but this technology was not developed into a product or sold to create economic added value and provide profits to Google. However, with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, products utilizing artificial intelligence technology in various industries have been developed and commercialized, creating tangible economic added value. As generative artificial intelligence represented by ChetGPT is commercialized as general-purpose artificial intelligence, a new phase of transition is occurring in which artificial intelligence technology can create tangible economic added value in the industrial sector. Eventually, as the acquisition and distribution of high-quality data, comparable to oil in the Industrial Revolution era, became recognized as key requirements for the actual success of new industries, the concept of the information subject's right to self-determination of personal information, which started out as a means of protecting personal information, expanded into the concept of distributing high-quality data and securing industrial data through it, and is now receiving renewed attention.The right to self-determination of personal information, which is also a key concept in the return of added value obtained through data containing personal information, was conceptualized to recognize individuals as legal information subjects with independent decision-making rights over their own information in response to the need for personal information protection as data containing personal information was utilized commercially and administratively as the data economy began in earnest. The right to self-determination of personal information was first discussed for the purpose of protecting personal information, but as data became recognized as a key resource in the production of industrial added value, it is now receiving recognition as a promotion perspective to eliminate data monopolies and return the added value produced through data distribution to individuals so that high-quality data can be utilized more actively throughout the industry.Thus, it is necessary to establish a return system in which the added value obtained through the distribution and use of personal information can be returned to the information subject by expanding the concept of the ..."

This dynamic service platform serves as a vehicle mobility terminal as a merged middleware layer between the control and data modules. In this vehicle mobility terminal, the in-vehicle component constituting the cross-service was fused with the dynamic service as a data module connected to the brake and engine, and the external system was modularized and designed. A study of these modularized services for external systems linked to in-vehicle vehicle diagnosis, management services, and service expansion modularized by dynamic services was presented. Currently, the modular service is created, deleted, updated, driven, and stopped when converting the data and service modules. It is also applied in real time to the framework. First, the personalized service distribution model design required for the vehicle convergence service terminal was applied. Second, we presented a user-centered CAN-based TDCSI(Thin Device Customer Service Interface) for the minimum resource use of embedded systems. Third, a UDP-based generative web service optimization model was constructed. These module configurations interact with communication service and data modules inside the vehicle in one direction, two directions, and user demand directions, respectively, so scenarios can be reflected as a life cycle process according to changes in external service requirements. The life cycle model is linked to various application services transmitted between vehicle external systems for data generated inside the vehicle.

Previous research has focused on performing OCR on single-language data. In this process, images are first input into a detection model to identify regions, which are then passed to a recognition model to extract text sentences. However, this approach is limited to single-language OCR networks and cannot process data in various languages. To address this limitation, we integrated a language classification model, which considers the characteristics of each language, into the existing model and developed a methodology for multilingual OCR by constructing independent recognition models for each language. The proposed pipeline was experimentally validated, demonstrating superior quantitative and qualitative performance on multilingual data."

Neural operators (NOs) offer remarkable speed-ups over classical numerical PDE solvers. Here, we conduct the first exploration and comparison of NOs for three-dimensional topology optimization. Specifically, we propose replacing the PDE solver within the popular Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) algorithm, which is its main computational bottleneck. For this, the NO not only needs to solve the PDE with sufficient accuracy but also has the additional challenge of providing accurate gradients which are necessary for SIMP’s density updates. To realize this, we do three things: (i) We introduce a novel loss term to promote gradient-consistency. (ii) We guarantee equivariance in our NOs to increase the physical correctness of predictions. (iii) We introduce a novel NO architecture called U-Net Fourier neural operator (U-Net FNO), which combines the multi-resolution properties of U-Nets with the Fourier neural operator (FNO)’s focus on local features in frequency space. In our experiments we demonstrate that the inclusion of the novel gradient loss term is necessary to obtain good results. Furthermore, enforcing group equivariance greatly improves the quality of predictions, especially on small training datasets. Finally, we show that in our experiments the U-Net FNO outperforms both a standard U-Net, as well as other FNO methods."

To analyze the classification results according to augmentation timing, we partition the augmentation timing into the pre-processing timing and the epoch timing. Subsequently, we compare the classification accuracy across these distinct timings to discern their impact on the results. Implementing the suggested random phase transformation augmentation technique at the epoch timing revealed an average accuracy enhancement of roughly 2% compared to augmentation at the pre-processing timing. Notably, this improvement was achieved using fewer data points in practical applications. Furthermore, it becomes evident that the selection and utilization of the optimal combination of phase values yield an additional enhancement in classification accuracy, surpassing 6%.

Inference of the vanishing point position first involves extracting the outlines from a image using the Canny edge detector, then retaining only the line components through Hough transformation. These lines are then extended to determine the vanishing point as the area where the most line intersections occur.

Conventional vehicle license plate recognition systems have relied on images obtained from fixed surveillance cameras for traffic detection to perform vehicle detection, tracking, and license plate recognition.However, during this process, image quality degradation occurred due to the physical distance between the camera and the vehicle, vehicle movement, and external environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions. In particular, the acquisition of low-resolution images due to camera performance limitations has been a major cause of significantly reduced accuracy in license plate recognition. To solve this problem, we propose a Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) model with a parallel structure that combines Multi-Scale and Attention Mechanism. This model is capable of effectively extracting features at various scales and focusing on important areas. Specifically, it generates feature maps of various sizes through a multi-branch structure and emphasizes the key features of license plates using an Attention Mechanism.

When compared with methods to process daytime RGB photos, processing infrared images has challenges due to the reduced signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR), indistinct outlines, and inadequate spatial resolutions. In addition, the detection of small targets remains challenging owing to their size variations and unclear edges, leading to missed detections and low accuracy. This work suggests the use of infrared-ship YOLO (IS-YOLO), a model to recognize small ships in infrared images. The proposed technique, based on YOLOv7, enhances the ability to detect infrared objects in heterogeneous scenarios. First, we improve the ability of the YOLOv7 backbone to extract features by introducing a new structure for the efficient layer aggregation network (ELAN) with a two convolutions and GhostConv module. Secondly, the max pooling pyramid-ELAN is introduced to integrate multi-scale information. Furthermore, we capture an infrared small ship dataset using the FLIR T620 camera. The experimental results demonstrate that the IS-YOLO model had the best performance in small ship detection from infrared images compared to several state-of-the-art models, as shown by optimal metrics that include average precision (AP@.5, AP@.5:.95, the number of parameters, and the model size): AP@.5, 88.9%; AP@.5:.95, 38.2%; 32.8 M; and 63.1 Mb, respectively.

In other words, this paper proposes a newtechnique to increase high-frequency reconstruction performance by applying explicit characteristics using hard segmentation to theimplicit neural representation model. This paper is based on a level-of-Experts method that selects a specific weight among severalweights according to the position. In this paper, we propose a method to assign different weights according to each segmentationarea by using hard segmentation based on luminance in an image rather than the existing even-sized tile format. Throughthis, the proposed method induces each weight in the layer to predict data values with similar characteristics, so that thehigh-frequency signal can be trained.

Additionally, the quality of dental prosthetics is influenced by the manual skill level of dental technicians who create them. To improve this, recent studies have utilized generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create dental prosthetics. With 2D GAN models, a problem arises when converting 3D dental data into 2D data, resulting in the loss of spatial features. Point cloud completion models, which use 3D data as input, offer a partial solution to this problem. The performance of point cloud completion models varies depending on the representation and information contained in the input data. With this in mind, this study proposes three methods for processing input data to improve performance: changing the uniformity of the point cloud distribution, varying the number of sampled points, and including occlusal information with adjacent teeth. Experiments were conducted to compare and analyze performance changes based on these input data modifications. The results showed that there was up to a 30% performance difference in representative point cloud completion models, SnowFlakeNet and SeedFormer, based on CD (Chamfer Distance) Loss."

This study proposes a effi cient railway region extraction model, called Railseg. Railseg is based on lightweight principles and consist of an encoder, an adaptive decoder and a segmentation head. The encoder is constructed by sandglass unit, eff ectively utilizing the convolution operator to encode features. The adaptive decoder can fuse context and spatial information based on the index-query mechanism. The segmentation head introduces ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling) to extract multi scale features. As a result, the number of parameters and FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) for Railseg are 1.54 M and 1.56 G, respectively. Considering real-time and segmentation performance, Railseg is more advantageous than some mainstream models, reaching 15 FPS (Frames Per Second) and 91.6% of mIoU (mean Intersection over Union) on the Jetson TX2.

This is especially true in supply chain management, where the relationship between suppliers and buyers plays a huge role in determining how efficiently a business runs and how profitable it can be. Traditionally, companies have relied on long-established  networks  and  past  relationships  when  selecting  partners. However, this  approach  can  be  limiting, as  it  often overlooks new opportunities due to gaps in information or preconceived biases. To tackle this challenge, the authors of the study introduced a new model based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN). This model is designed to help businesses in South Korea identify potential partnerships across a variety of industries. By taking factors like company size, product offerings, and market position into account, the DNN model  can pinpoint partnerships that would be mutually beneficial. The results were striking—there was a significant increase in the number of potential  partnerships  identified, showing just how effective this approach could  be in widening the scope of business collaborations. Notably, the model identified numerous feasible buyer companies that had not been previously   considered   by   suppliers,  suggesting   that   DNN-based   recommendations   can   challenge   and   reshape   traditional perspectives on business compatibility.

This capability allows each head to concurrently process its own set of tokens, integrating diverse information from the input sequence. However, previous studies have shown that not all heads learn valuable and distinct features from each other, instead only a few selected heads prove significant. This does not align with the purpose of multi-head attention, therefore, in this paper, we redesign the multi-head attention mechanism to ensure each head focuses on different features of the input, promoting the capture of unique, non-overlapping features. This approach allows all heads to contribute effectively during the inference stage.

In an operation, the clinician needs to observe the abnormal placental vessels through the endoscope, so as to guide the operation. However, low-quality imaging and narrow field of view of the fetoscope increase the difficulty of the operation. Introducing an accurate placental vessel segmentation of fetoscopic images can assist the fetoscopic laser photocoagulation and help identify the abnormal vessels. This study proposes a method to solve the above problems. A novel encoder-decoder network with a dual-path structure is proposed to segment the placental vessels in fetoscopic images. In particular, we introduce a channel attention mechanism and a continuous convolution structure to obtain multi-scale features with their weights. Moreover, a switching connection is inserted between the corresponding blocks of the two paths to strengthen their relationship. According to the results of a set of blood vessel segmentation experiments conducted on a public fetoscopic image dataset, our method has achieved higher scores than the current mainstream segmentation methods, raising the dice similarity coefficient, intersection over union, and pixel accuracy by 5.80%, 8.39% and 0.62%, respectively."

It supports making the right decision in investing or analysts' evaluation. However, the research on Arabic SA is limited compared to that on English SA due to the complexity and limited corpora of the Arabic language. This paper develops a model of sentiment classification to predict the polarity of Arabic stock news in microblogs. Also, it aims to extract the reasons which lead to polarity categorization as the main economic causes or aspects based on semantic unity. Therefore, this paper presents an Arabic SA approach based on the logistic regression model and the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. The proposed model is used to classify articles as positive, negative, or neutral. It was trained on the basis of data collected from an official Saudi stock market article platform that was later preprocessed and labeled. Moreover, the economic reasons for the articles based on semantic unit, divided into seven economic aspects to highlight the polarity of the articles, were investigated. The supervised BERT model obtained 88% article classification accuracy based on SA, and the unsupervised mean Word2Vec encoder obtained 80% economic-aspect clustering accuracy. Predicting polarity classification on the Arabic stock market news and their economic reasons would provide valuable benefits to the stock SA field."

Identifying osseous structures is a key aspect of navigating a 3-dimensional virtual reconstruction. To automate the otherwise time-consuming process of labeling vertebrae on each slice individually, we propose a fully automated pipeline that automates segmentation on computed tomography (CT) and which can form the basis for further virtual or augmented reality application and radiomic analysis.Methods: Based on a large public dataset of annotated vertebral CT scans, we first trained a YOLOv8m (You-Only-Look-Once algorithm, Version 8 and size medium) to detect each vertebra individually. On the then cropped images, a 2D-U-Net was developed and externally validated on 2 different public datasets.Results: Two hundred fourteen CT scans (cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine) were used for model training, and 40 scans were used for external validation. Vertebra recognition achieved a mAP50 (mean average precision with Jaccard threshold of 0.5) of over 0.84, and the segmentation algorithm attained a mean Dice score of 0.75 ± 0.14 at internal, 0.77 ± 0.12 and 0.82 ± 0.14 at external validation, respectively.Conclusion: We propose a 2-stage approach consisting of single vertebra labeling by an object detection algorithm followed by semantic segmentation.

In intricate systems like aircraft, the failure of a single component can affect the entire system, thereby posing operational disruptions and safety hazards. Therefore, the accurate prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of aircraft engines is crucial for ensuring safety and optimizing operational efficiency.Methods: To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that integrates a one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder (1D-CAE) and a regression model. The 1D-CAE is trained using sensor data collected from specific aircraft engines. Subsequently, sensor data from other engines undergo encoding through the trained 1D-CAE to extract hidden features. These features are then utilized to train a regression model. The combined use of the 1D-CAE’s encoder and the regression model enables the prediction of the RUL of aircraft engines.Results: Combined with the XGBoost regression model, the proposed approach demonstrated exceptional performance, as evidenced by a root mean squared error of 16.49. This approach outperformed conventional machine learning methodologies that did not incorporate the 1D-CAE.Additionally, our methodology exhibited superior performance compared to those reported in previous studies, resulting in an enhancement of approximately 6%.Conclusion: The integration of the 1D-CAE and regression model provides an effective means of predicting RUL and extends its applicability to diverse fields while mitigating risks and reducing costs associated with system failures."

Whereas conventional VIO has limited capability to estimate scale of translation, the performance of recent approaches has been improved by utilizing depth maps obtained from RGB-D camera, especially in indoor environments. However, the depth map obtained from the RGB-D camera tends to rapidly lose accuracy as the distance increases, and therefore, it is required to develop alternative method to improve the VIO performance in wide environments. In this paper, we argue that leveraging depth map estimated from a deep neural network has benefits to state estimation. To improve the reliability of depth information utilized in VIO algorithm, we propose a kernel-based sampling strategy to filter out depth values with low confidence. The proposed method aims to improve the robustness and accuracy of VIO algorithms by selectively utilizing reliable values of estimated depth maps. Experiments were conducted on real-world custom dataset acquired from underground parking lot environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to improve the performance of VIO, exhibiting potential for the use of depth estimation network for state estimation."

More than 50% of falls among elderly people occur in homes that are considered relatively safe, with falls mostly occurring during the morning hours of the day. This trend reminds us that when paying attention to the safety of the elderly, we need to pay special attention to the safety of the family environment and the supervision during the daytime. In this paper, Based on You Only Look Ones (YOLOv8) model infrastructure, combined with deep neck structure and simplified head structure, the system can build high detection accuracy and real-time performance, so that the system can timely detect dangerous behaviors of the elderly people, such as falls. Improve the detection of dangerous behaviors such as falls in real-time and accuracy, which helps reduce the risk of injury caused by delayed detection and treatment, and improve the quality of life of the elderly people. Especially when the elderly live alone or lack the care of guardians, the system can become an ""AI alarm"" and provide all-weather security guard. Experiments show that the detection response time of the system is 275 fps, and the recall rate is 90.2%. And it is linked with the face and behavior identification system, the medical record intelligent matching system of the medical institution, the alarm information transmission system of the communication institution, and the information sharing system of the emergency institution to achieve the emergency response of the elderly who fall at the minute level."

We evaluated the feasibility, accuracy, and predictive value of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated system for echocardiographic analysis in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).Methods: The AI-based system was developed using a nationwide echocardiographic dataset from five tertiary hospitals, and automatically identified views, then segmented and tracked the left ventricle (LV) and left atrium (LA) to produce volume and strain values. Both conventional manual measurements and AI-based fully automated measurements of the LV ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain, and LA volume index and reservoir strain were performed in 632 patients with STEMI.Results: The AI-based system accurately identified necessary views (overall accuracy, 98.5%) and successfully measured LV and LA volumes and strains in all cases in which conventional methods were applicable. Inter-method analysis showed strong correlations between measurement methods, with Pearson coefficients ranging 0.81–0.92 and intraclass correlation coefficients ranging 0.74–0.90. For the prediction of clinical outcomes (composite of all-cause death, re-hospitalization due to heart failure, ventricular arrhythmia, and recurrent myocardial infarction), AI-derived measurements showed predictive value independent of clinical risk factors, comparable to those from conventional manual measurements.Conclusions: Our fully automated AI-based approach for LV and LA analysis on echocardiography is feasible and provides accurate measurements, comparable to conventional methods, in patients with STEMI, offering a promising solution for comprehensive echocardiographic analysis, reduced workloads, and improved patient care."

"""ATT-NestedUnet : Sugar Beet and Weed Detection using Semantic Segmentation""",2024,"['ATT-NestedUNet', 'Deep learning', 'Weed detection', 'Semantic Segmentation', 'Sugarbeet']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Sugar beet is a biennial herb with cold, drought, and salinity resistance and is one of the world's major sugar crops. In addition to sugar, sugar beets are important raw materials for chemical and pharmaceutical products, and the residue after sugar extraction can be used to produce agricultural by-products, such as compound feed, which has a high comprehensive utilization value [1]. Field weeds, such as sugar beets, are harmful to crop growth and can compete with crops for sunlight and nutrients. If weeds are not removed in time during crop growth, they cause a decrease in crop yield and quality. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the development of automated machinery for selective weeding operations. The core component of this technology is a vision system that distinguishes between crops and weeds. To address the problems of difficult weed extraction, poor detection, and segmentation of  region boundaries in traditional sugar beet detection, an end-to-end encoder–decoder model based on an improved UNet++ for segmentation is proposed in this paper and applied to sugar beet and weed detection. UNet++ can better fuse feature maps from different layers by skipping connections and can effectively preserve the details of sugar beet and weed images. The new model adds an attention mechanism to UNet++ by embedding the attention module into the upsampling process of UNet++ to suppress interference from extraneous noise. The improved model was evaluated on a sugar beet and weed dataset containing 1026 images. The image dataset in this study was obtained from sugar beet and weed images collected at the University of Bonn, Germany. According to the experimental results, the model can significantly eliminate noise and improve segmentation accuracy"

A Dynamic Head Gesture Recognition Method for Real-time Intention Inference and Its Application to Visual Human-robot Interaction,2024,"['Computer vision', 'deep learning', 'head gesture', 'human-robot interaction.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Head gesture is a natural and non-verbal communication method for human-computer and human-robot interaction, conveying attitudes and intentions. However, the existing vision-based recognition methods cannot meet the precision and robustness of interaction requirements. Due to the limited computational resources, applying most high-accuracy methods to mobile and onboard devices is challenging. Moreover, the wearable device-based approach is inconvenient and expensive. To deal with these problems, an end-to-end two-stream fusion network named TSIR3D is proposed to identify head gestures from videos for analyzing human attitudes and intentions. Inspired by Inception and ResNet architecture, the width and depth of the network are increased to capture motion features sufficiently. Meanwhile, convolutional kernels are expanded from the spatial domain to the spatiotemporal domain for temporal feature extraction. The fusion position of the two-stream channel is explored under an accuracy/complexity trade-off to a certain extent. Furthermore, a dynamic head gesture dataset named DHG and a behavior tree are designed for human-robot interaction. Experimental results show that the proposed method has advantages in real-time performance on the remote server or the onboard computer. Furthermore, its accuracy on the DHG can surpass most state-of-the-art vision-based methods and is even better than most previous approaches based on head-mounted sensors. Finally, TSIR3D is applied on Pepper Robot equipped with Jetson TX2."

The signed distance function was used to convert missile geometry to image data with various resolutions. Aerodynamic dataset was generated by using Missile DATCOM. To check the uncertainty due to the randomness of trained deep neural network models, box plots of prediction errors from independently trained multiple mod- els were generated and compared. Grad-CAM was used to provide explainability to missile conﬁguration images. It was conﬁrmed that predictions of the neural network model become robust as the size of dataset increases. MINN1, which only uses image resolution of whole missile geometry was found to be unable to accurately predict effects of the nose type on axial force. Therefore, the missile nose type information was explicitly provided to the second input layer in MINN2. Then, a CNN classiﬁcation model was developed for nose type prediction using signed distance function image around the missile nose. The accuracy of the nose type classiﬁcation CNN model was 100% for 642 or higher input image resolutions. CNN + MINN2 architecture, which provides MINN2 with the predicted nose type by the CNN model, was built and compared with MINN1 and MINN2. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) was also used for comparison with the MINN models as a reference.Both MINN2 and CNN + MINN2 are conﬁrmed to be very accurate having relative errors less than 5%."

However, further development and studies have encountered challenges, particularly in acquiring large-scale datasets. Data collection is costly and time-consuming, posing a significant challenge in acquiring large datasets required for training neural networks. To address this issue, this study introduces a simulation that efficiently generates the necessary data and labels for training neural networks. We utilized a genetic algorithm (GA) to create optimized lists of aggregates based on the specified values of weight and particle size distribution for the aggregate sample. This enabled sample data collection without conducting sieving tests. Our evaluation of the proposed simulation and GA methodology revealed errors of 1.3% and 2.7 g for aggregate size distribution and weight, respectively. Furthermore, we assessed a segmentation model trained with data from the simulation, achieving a promising preliminary F1 score of 78.18 on the actual aggregate image."

TomoRay: Generating Synthetic  Computed Tomography of the Spine  From Biplanar Radiographs,2024,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Image conversion', 'Synthetic computed tomography', 'Spine', 'Machine learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objective: Computed tomography (CT) imaging is a cornerstone in the assessment of patients with spinal trauma and in the planning of spinal interventions. However, CT studies are associated with logistical problems, acquisition costs, and radiation exposure. In this proof-of-concept study, the feasibility of generating synthetic spinal CT images using biplanar radiographs was explored. This could expand the potential applications of x-ray machines pre-, post-, and even intraoperatively.Methods: A cohort of 209 patients who underwent spinal CT imaging from the VerSe2020 dataset was used to train the algorithm. The model was subsequently evaluated using an internal and external validation set containing 55 from the VerSe2020 dataset and a subset of 56 images from the CTSpine1K dataset, respectively. Digitally reconstructed radiographs served as input for training and evaluation of the 2-dimensional (2D)-to-3-dimentional (3D) generative adversarial model. Model performance was assessed using peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and cosine similarity (CS).Results: At external validation, the developed model achieved a PSNR of 21.139 ± 1.018 dB (mean ± standard deviation). The SSIM and CS amounted to 0.947 ± 0.010 and 0.671 ± 0.691, respectively.Conclusion: Generating an artificial 3D output from 2D imaging is challenging, especially for spinal imaging, where x-rays are known to deliver insufficient information frequently.Although the synthetic CT scans derived from our model do not perfectly match their ground truth CT, our proof-of-concept study warrants further exploration of the potential of this technology."

In this method, the Mish, a smoother function, replaces the Leaky ReLU activation function of YOLOv7, effectively expanding the network's information processing capabilities. Concurrently, a Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanism (SEAM) has been integrated into the head of the model, significantly augmenting the precision of small target defect detection. Additionally, considering angular loss, compared to the CIoU loss function in YOLOv7, the SIoU loss function in the paper enhances robustness and training speed and optimizes inference accuracy. In terms of data preprocessing, this study has devised a brightness adjustment data enhancement technique based on split-filtering to enrich the dataset while minimizing the impact of noise and lighting on images. The experimental results under identical training conditions demonstrate that our model exhibits a 9.9% increase in mAP value and an FPS increase to 164 compared to the YOLOv7. These indicate that the method proposed has a superior performance in PCBA defect detection and has a specific application value."

The majority of existing deepfake detection methods have primarily focused on RGB-based analysis, offering unreliable performance in terms of detection accuracy and time. To address the issue, a grayscale-based deepfake detection method has recently been proposed. This method significantly reduces detection time while providing comparable accuracy to RGB-based methods. However, despite its significant effectiveness, the “key components” that directly affect the performance of grayscale-based deepfake detection have not been systematically analyzed. In this paper, we target three key components: RGB-to-grayscale conversion method, brightness level in grayscale, and resolution level in grayscale. To analyze their impacts on the performance of grayscale-based deepfake detection, we conducted comprehensive evaluations, including component-wise analysis and comparative analysis using real-world datasets. For each key component, we quantitatively analyzed its characteristics’ performance and identified differences between them. Moreover, we successfully verified the effectiveness of an optimal combination of the key components by comparing it with existing deepfake detection methods."

This network is a lightweight network with a small number of parameters for small image segmentation datasets. However, when the medical image to be segmented contains a lot of detailed information, the segmentation results cannot fully meet the actual requirements. In order to achieve higher accuracy of medical image segmentation, a novel improved U-Net network architecture called multi-scale encoder-decoder U-Net+ (MEDU-Net+) is proposed in this paper. We design the GoogLeNet for achieving more information at the encoder of the proposed MEDU-Net+, and present the multi-scale feature extraction for fusing semantic information of different scales in the encoder and decoder. Meanwhile, we also introduce the layer-by-layer skip connection to connect the information of each layer, so that there is no need to encode the last layer and return the information. The proposed MEDU-Net+ divides the unknown depth network into each part of deconvolution layer to replace the direct connection of the encoder and decoder in U-Net. In addition, a new combined loss function is proposed to extract more edge information by combining the advantages of the generalized dice and the focal loss functions. Finally, we validate our proposed MEDU-Net+ MEDU-Net+ and other classic medical image segmentation networks on three medical image datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed MEDU-Net+ has prominent superior performance compared with other medical image segmentation networks."

EfficientNet-B0 outperforms other CNNs in image-based five-class embryo grading: a comparative analysis,2024,"['blastocyst', 'convolutional neural networks', 'deep learning', 'embryo', 'in vitro fertilization']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: Evaluating embryo quality is crucial for the success of in vitro fertilization procedures. Traditional methods, such as the Gardner grading system, rely on subjective human assessment of morphological features, leading to potential inconsistencies and errors. Artificial intelligence-powered grading systems offer a more objective and consistent approach by reducing human biases and enhancing accuracy and reliability.Methods: We evaluated the performance of five convolutional neural network architectures—EfficientNet-B0, InceptionV3, ResNet18, ResNet50, and VGG16— in grading blastocysts into five quality classes using only embryo images, without incorporating clinical or patient data. Transfer learning was applied to adapt pretrained models to our dataset, and data augmentation techniques were employed to improve model generalizability and address class imbalance.Results: EfficientNet-B0 outperformed the other architectures, achieving the highest accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and F1-score across all evaluation metrics. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping was used to interpret the models’ decision-making processes, revealing that the most successful models predominantly focused on the inner cell mass, a critical determinant of embryo quality.Conclusions: Convolutional neural networks, particularly EfficientNet-B0, can significantly enhance the reliability and consistency of embryo grading in in vitro fertilization procedures by providing objective assessments based solely on embryo images. This approach offers a promising alternative to traditional subjective morphological evaluations."

However, there are limitations in meeting the service requirements with the vehicles limited resources. Therefore, the methodology of offloading tasks to edge servers is gaining attention. However, edge servers are resource-constrained compared to centralized servers, and this can lead to overload and localized offloading failures with high traffic or when a large number of high-computation tasks are requested. In this paper, we propose an algorithm designed to address the problem of load imbalance among edge servers in a vehicular offloading system. The proposed algorithm aims to maximize the utilization of the limited edge servers resources to increase the offloading success rate. We have formulated an optimization problem to form a cluster among edge servers and minimize the deviation of available resources within the cluster. To facilitate optimal load distribution in dynamic environments, we propose an algorithm that utilizes a reinforcement learning model TD3 (Twin Delay DDPG). Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively alleviates load imbalance, particularly in environments with a growing number of vehicles or an increasing diversity of tasks. The algorithm achieves a high offloading success rate and confirms the scalability improvement resulting from load balancing."

This review presents a clinical task-based evaluation, highlighting the specific impact of AI techniques on different aspects of spinal imaging and patient care. We first discuss how AI can potentially improve image quality through techniques like denoising or artifact reduction. We then explore how AI enables efficient quantification of anatomical measurements, spinal curvature parameters, vertebral segmentation, and disc grading. This facilitates objective, accurate interpretation and diagnosis. AI models now reliably detect key spinal pathologies, achieving expert-level performance in tasks like identifying fractures, stenosis, infections, and tumors. Beyond diagnosis, AI also assists surgical planning via synthetic computed tomography generation, augmented reality systems, and robotic guidance. Furthermore, AI image analysis combined with clinical data enables personalized predictions to guide treatment decisions, such as forecasting spine surgery outcomes. However, challenges still need to be addressed in implementing AI clinically, including model interpretability, generalizability, and data limitations.

By improving the conditions by which image data are acquired inside the tunnel structure, high-quality image data can be obtained from area type tunnel scanning. To improve the data acquisition conditions, a longitudinal rail of the tunnel can be installed on the tunnel ceiling, and image data of the entire tunnel structure can be acquired by moving the installed rail. This study identified 0.5 mm cracked simulation lines under a distance condition of 20 m at resolutions of 3,840 × 2,160 and 720 × 480 pixels. In addition, the proposed image-data-structuring method could acquire image data in image tile units. Here, the image data of the tunnel can be structured by substituting the application factors (resolution of the acquired image and the tunnel size) into a relationship equation. In an experiment, the image data of a tunnel with a length of 1,000 m and a width of 20 m were obtained with a minimum overlap rate of 0.02% to 8.36% depending on resolution and precision, and the size of the local coordinate system was found to be (14 × 15) to (36 × 34) pixels."
Carbonation depth prediction of concrete bridges based on long short-term memory,2024,"['bridge', 'concrete carbonation', 'deep learning', 'long short-term memory', 'prediction', 'time-series update']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study proposes a novel long short-term memory (LSTM)-based approach for predicting carbonation depth, with the aim of enhancing the durability evaluation of concrete structures. Conventional carbonation depth prediction relies on statistical methodologies using carbonation influencing factors and in-situ carbonation depth data. However, applying in-situ data for predictive modeling faces challenges due to the lack of time-series data. To address this limitation, an LSTM-based carbonation depth prediction technique is proposed. First, training data are generated through random sampling from the distribution of carbonation velocity coefficients, which are calculated from in-situ carbonation depth data. Subsequently, a Bayesian theorem is applied to tailor the training data for each target bridge, which are depending on surrounding environmental conditions. Ultimately, the LSTM model predicts the time-dependent carbonation depth data for the target bridge. To examine the feasibility of this technique, a carbonation depth dataset from 3,960 in-situ bridges was used for training, and untrained timeseries data from the Miho River bridge in the Republic of Korea were used for experimental validation. The results of the experimental validation demonstrate a significant reduction in prediction error from 8.19% to 1.75% compared with the conventional statistical method. Furthermore, the LSTM prediction result can be enhanced by sequentially updating the LSTM model using actual time-series measurement data."

The unique infrastructure-less nature of MANETs poses challenges in developing an eff ective and reliable IDS. Our proposed solution addresses these challenges by incorporating several key elements. First, we employ a hybrid authentication mechanism to authenticate network nodes, ensuring a secure environment. Authenticated nodes are then allowed to form clusters based on a similarity index (SI), facilitating effi cient communication and routing within the network. To optimize routing, we introduce the wild horse optimization algorithm, which considers multiple metrics to select the most optimal route. To detect and mitigate intrusions, we propose the deep actor-critic learning (DAC) approach. This algorithm learns features from network packets through the Blockchain, which serves as a monitoring system for data transmission. If an intrusion is detected, the DAC algorithm updates the network with feedback, enabling prompt response and resolution. By combining these algorithms, our proposed approach achieves improved effi ciency in various metrics, including PDR, throughput, time analysis, detection accuracy, and security level.The results demonstrate the eff ectiveness of our lightweight IDS driven by a decentralized Blockchain network in enhancing the overall performance and security of MANETs."
Multi-Class Multi-Object Tracking in Aerial Images Using Uncertainty Estimation,2024,"['Detection', 'Tracking', 'Uncertainty', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a vital component in understanding the surrounding environ -ments. Previous research has demonstrated that MOT can successfully detect and track surroundingobjects. Nonetheless, inaccurate classification of the tracking objects remains a challenge that needs to besolved. When an object approaching from a distance is recognized, not only detection and tracking butalso classification to determine the level of risk must be performed. However, considering the erroneousclassification results obtained from the detection as the track class can lead to performance degradationproblems. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of classification in tracking under the classificationuncertainty of the detector. To address this problem, a class update module is proposed, which leveragesthe class uncertainty estimation of the detector to mitigate the classification error of the tracker. Weevaluated our approach on the VisDrone-MOT2021 dataset, which includes multi-class and uncertain far-distance object tracking. We show that our method has low certainty at a distant object, and quicklyclassifies the class as the object approaches and the level of certainty increases. In this manner, our methodoutperforms previous approaches across different detectors. In particular, the You Only Look Once(YOLO)v8 detector shows a notable enhancement of 4.33 multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) incomparison to the previous state-of-the-art method. This intuitive insight improves MOT to trackapproaching objects from a distance and quickly classify them."

To develop such a system, the initial step involves accurately segmenting cow body regions for subsequent trait measurement.Methods Thus, the present study introduces a refined DeepLabV3 + CNN model with EfficientNetB2 as the backbone and enhanced with attention mechanisms, aiming for precise segmentation of cow body regions from lateral and posterior views.In the DeepLabV3 + model, various backbone models, including MobileNet, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB1, and EfficientNetB2, were evaluated. Among these, EfficientNetB2 exhibited superior performance in lateral view segmentation, achieving a mean Intersection-over-union (m-IoU) of 94.19%. To further enhance segmentation accuracy, attention mechanisms such as Squeeze and Excitation (SE), Residual connection-infused Squeeze and Excitation (SER), Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and Residual connection-infused Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAMR) were incorporated into the DeepLabV3 + model.Results The introduction of attention mechanisms in the EfficientNetB2 model led to enhanced m-IoU values: SE (94.27%), SER (94.25%), CBAM (94.59%), and CBAMR (94.66%). EfficientNetB2, integrated with CBAM and Residual connections (termed CBAMR), found to be top-performing model, achieving m-IoU values of 94.66% (lateral view), 93.77% (posterior view), and 99.61% (stature). The lateral view segmentation demonstrated high IoU for the body (98.73%) and rump (96.54%), with lowest IoU for teats (79.70%) due to their smaller spatial presence in input image. For posterior view regions, the CBAMR model achieved IoU scores above 79.0%, with the rear leg showing the highest (96.70%) and rump bones the lowest (79.52%). The segmentation accuracy for stature exceeded 90.0%, indicating less complexity in single-body region segmentation.Conclusions Therefore, these developed models demonstrate considerable accuracy in segmenting cow regions, making a significant contribution to the advancement of computer vision–based systems for measuring linear-type traits, and hold promise for deployment in such an automatic system."

ELS options present significant challenges due to their intricate payoff structure and path-dependent nature. We experimented with two types of ELS options: stepdown knock-in and knockout options. The DeepBSDE model shows similar results to those of classical methods like Monte Carlo method and Finite Difference method, but with distinct advantages. While Monte Carlo method provides only the options value without any additional information such as the value of Greeks, and while Finite Difference method offers comprehensive domain information but struggles with multi-dimensional problems, DeepBSDE avoids the curse of dimensionality, making it more practical for usage in multi-asset options. The results of our experiment reveal that despite its initial longer training times, the DeepBSDE model’s inference time is comparable to that of the classical methods, hence minimizing computational burden once the model is trained. Such efficiency makes the DeepBSDE model particularly suitable for markets in countries like South Korea, where stepdown ELS options dominate, constituting 70% of the market transaction. The DeepBSDE model’s flexibility also allows for future extensions to evaluate ELS options with multiple underlying assets and incorporate correlations between such assets. Additionally, enhancing the model to consider multiple early redemption points will further improve its practical application."

Historically, early image compression relied on rudimentary codecs, aiming to compress and decompress data with minimal loss of image quality. Recently, a novel compression framework leveraging colorization techniques has emerged. These methods, originally developed for infusing grayscale images with color, have found application in image compression, leading to colorization-based coding. Within this framework, the encoder plays a crucial role in automatically extracting representative pixels-referred to as color seeds-and transmitting them to the decoder. The decoder, utilizing colorization methods, reconstructs color information for the remaining pixels based on the transmitted data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to image compression, wherein we decompose the compression task into grayscale image compression and colorization tasks. Unlike conventional colorization-based coding, our method focuses on the colorization process rather than the extraction of color seeds. Moreover, we employ the Denoising Diffusion Null-Space Model (DDNM) for colorization, ensuring high-quality color restoration and contributing to superior compression rates. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher-quality decompressed images compared to standard JPEG and JPEG2000 compression schemes, particularly in high compression rate scenarios."

In the realm of medical image analysis, a pressing challenge is to develop a reliable method for eff ectively separating tumor regions from healthy tissues in brain MRI scans. This research introduces an automated brain tumor segmentation approach utilizing a hybrid model, combining a residual network and UNeXt (referred to as hRes2-UNeXt). In this architecture, the U-Next model functions as an encoder, while a residual network serves as an encoder to mitigate the zero-gradient problem. Additionally, skip connections are employed between residual and convolutional blocks to expedite the training process. The evaluation of this approach on the BRATS 2021 dataset yielded promising results, with mean dice scores of 0.9157 for the tumor core (TC), 0.9320 for the whole tumor (WT), and 0.9226 for the enhancing tumor (ET).

Autonomous Defense of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Against Missile Attacks Using a GRU-Based PPO Algorithm,2024,"['unmanned aerial vehicle', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'decision-making', 'centroid jamming']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper introduces a method enabling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously defend themselves against incoming missiles during military missions. A simulation environment for UAV defense against incoming missiles was created by constructing motion models for a UAV, a missile, and infrared decoys in three-dimensional space. A UAV defense strategy generation algorithm based on gated recurrent unit (GRU) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) is proposed, which effectively addresses the problem of low survival rates when under attack from enemy missiles. Specifically, the algorithm estimates the current true state based on current and historical observations and makes decisions based on the state estimate, effectively solving the non-Markov problem caused by the lack of infrared decoy information in the observations. The experimental results indicate that this method provides an effective defense strategy, combining evasion maneuvers with infrared decoys to effectively evade incoming missiles."

A Method for Generating Malware Countermeasure Samples Based on Pixel Attention Mechanism,2024,"['Malware', 'Generative Adversarial Networks', 'Deep Learning', 'Pixel Attention Mechanism', 'Adversarial Samples']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Studies have shown that malware has become a primary means of attacking the Internet. Therefore, adversarial samples have become a vital breakthrough point for studying malware. By studying adversarial samples, we can gain insights into the behavior and characteristics of malware, evaluate the performance of existing detectors in the face of deceptive samples, and help to discover vulnerabilities and improve detection methods for better performance. However, existing adversarial sample generation methods still need help regarding escape effectiveness and mobility. For instance, researchers have attempted to incorporate perturbation methods like Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and others into adversarial samples to obfuscate detectors. However, these methods are only effective in specific environments and yield limited evasion effectiveness. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a malware adversarial sample generation method (PixGAN) based on the pixel attention mechanism, which aims to improve adversarial samples' escape effect and mobility. The method transforms malware into grey-scale images and introduces the pixel attention mechanism in the Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) model to weigh the critical pixels in the grey-scale map, which improves the modeling ability of the generator and discriminator, thus enhancing the escape effect and mobility of the adversarial samples. The escape rate (ASR) is used as an evaluation index of the quality of the adversarial samples. The experimental results show that the adversarial samples generated by PixGAN achieve escape rates of 97%, 94%, 35%, 39%, and 43% on the Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network (CNN_RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory (CNN_LSTM) algorithmic detectors, respectively."

The performance of the Clipseg multimodal model was compared with two unimodal models including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Unet and Transformer-based Segformer for land cover classification. Using orthophotos of two areas (Area1 and Area2) in Wonju City, Gangwon Province, classification was performed for seven land cover categories (Forest, Cropland, Grassland, Wetland, Settlement, Bare Land, and Forestry-managed Land). The results showed that the Clipseg model demonstrated the highest generalization performance in new environments, achieving the highest accuracy among the three models with an Overall Accuracy of 83.9% and Kappa of 0.72 in the test area (Area2). It performed particularly well in classifying Forest (F1-Score 94.7%), Cropland (78.0%), and Settlement (78.4%). While Unet and Segformer models showed high accuracy in the training area (Area1), they exhibited limitations in generalization ability with accuracy decreases of 29% and 20% respectively in the test area. The Clipseg model required the most parameters (approximately 150 million) and the longest training time (10 hours 48 minutes) but showed stable performance in new environments. In contrast, Segformer achieved considerable accuracy with the least parameters (about 16 million) and the shortest training time (3 hours 21 minutes), demonstrating its potential for use in resource-limited environments. This study shows that image-text-based multimodal models have a high potential for land cover classification. Their superior generalization ability in new environments suggests they can be effectively applied to land cover classification in various regions. Future research could further improve classification accuracy through model structure improvements, addressing data imbalances, and additional validation in diverse environments."

The accurate prediction of the driving trajectories of surrounding vehicles is essential for the decision-making processes of autonomous vehicles(AVs). Furthermore, the ability to predict imminent collisions can significantly enhance the safety of AVs. However, although several studies have addressed these issues individually, it is rare to find research that tackles both problems simultaneously. Hence, to facilitate the multitasks of collision prediction and trajectory prediction, we modified the prediction head associated with the final layer of the network to enable multitasking capabilities. This study explored two model architectures: one with an encoder-decoder structure and another with only a decoder. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with existing algorithms in the literature. The results demonstrate that our suggested algorithm outperforms previous methods in terms of parallelization."

The participants were 115 first-year university students from diverse majors. They were randomly assigned to either read the text of ‘The Old Man and the Sea’ or watch its video adaptation, then wrote responses to the content that made an impression on them. The research findings were obtained through both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analysis of the students’ responses showed no significant differences between reading the text and watching the video. However, the qualitative analysis revealed distinct patterns of literary understanding and responses between the two media. Reading the text encouraged deep internal interpretation and personal reflection, whereas watching the video enhanced visual comprehension and emotional engagement with the narrative. These findings suggest that integrating text reading and visual media in literature education can enrich students’ understanding and responses to literary works. Consequently, educators, especially those teaching Korean language and literature, should consider devising reading education strategies that leverage media to accommodate individual differences in students’ reading levels and motivations. This research provides essential insights for future reading research and educational practices that aim to diversify teaching and learning methods by incorporating various media."

Due to the limitations of the number of observation stations and other factors, humidity data are often not as good as expected, so high-resolution humidity fields are of great interest and have been the object of desire in the research field and industry. This study presents a novel super-resolution algorithm for humidity fields based on the Wasserstein generative adversarial network(WGAN) framework, with the objective of enhancing the resolution of low-resolution humidity field information. WGAN is a more stable generative adversarial networks(GANs) with Wasserstein metric, and to make the training more stable and simple, the gradient cropping is replaced with gradient penalty, and the network feature representation is improved by sub-pixel convolution, residual block combined with convolutional block attention module(CBAM) and other techniques.

Furthermore, we extracted 25,317 key-frames from disaster videos and classified them into eight types by employing an image classifier we developed based on Vision Transformer. Results of the video-level analysis revealed that countries with higher development levels in North America and Europe, as well as conflict-ridden countries, tended to have more videos. In contrast, disaster video ratios were higher in coverage related to the third-world, such as Africa. This implies that quantitative inequality and qualitative bias persist in international news, depending on the country’s development level. In a frame-level analysis, disaster videos about the third-world featured more images of human damage. Sensational reporting, focusing on evoking emotions rather than fostering a nuanced understanding of disasters, was evident through the vivid portrayal of victims. This indicates a deviation from the norms of disaster reporting, taking advantage of the lack of protection for victims in the third-world. As Susan Sontag pointed out, it can be argued that such reporting, through the everyday consumption of ‘pains of others’, reinforces the spread of apathy and indifference towards the sufferings without practical engagement."

The inability to identify safe crossing locations and assess the feasibility of crossing significantly restricts their mobility and independence. Globally, an estimated 285 million people suffer from visual impairment, with 39 million categorized as blind and 246 million as visually impaired, according to the World Health Organization. In Saudi Arabia alone, there are approximately 159 thousand blind individuals, as per unofficial statistics. The profound impact of visual impairments on daily activities underscores the urgent need for solutions to improve mobility and enhance safety. This study aims to address this pressing issue by leveraging computer vision and deep learning techniques to enhance object detection capabilities. Two models were trained to detect objects: one focused on street crossing obstacles, and the other aimed to search for objects. The first model was trained on a dataset comprising 5283 images of road obstacles and traffic signals, annotated to create a labeled dataset. Subsequently, it was trained using the YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 models, with YOLOv5 achieving a satisfactory accuracy of 84%. The second model was trained on the COCO dataset using YOLOv5, yielding an impressive accuracy of 94%. By improving object detection capabilities through advanced technology, this research seeks to empower individuals with visual impairments, enhancing their mobility, independence, and overall quality of life."

In this review, we provided a comprehensive overview of various eating behaviors commonly observed in individuals with ASD. These behaviors include 1) food neophobia, 2) selective eating, 3) binge eating, 4) food avoidance, 5) chewing and swallowing problems, 6) pica, 7) rumination, 8) rituals, and 9) problematic behaviors. Furthermore, we provide a perspective of utilizing digital tools: 1) augmentative and alternative communication; 2) ecological momentary assessment; and 3) video analysis, behavioral analysis, and facial expression analysis.

The complete solution to the problem has not been found yet, therefore only partial information about the structure can be obtained from mass spectra, often in the form of various molecular fingerprints. One of the latest approaches for prediction of molecular fingerprints from electron ionization mass spectra is DeepEI, which suggested a suboptimal procedure based on using a separate neural network for each molecular fingerprint (more than 100 models in our work and 636 using the DeepEI method). More than that, after repeating the procedure described in the original article, we assumed that at least some of their models were most likely overfitted. We streamlined the original approach by predicting multiple types of molecular finger- prints with a single multi-output neural network. We developed a lightweight and performant architecture (called Lite model for brevity) with improved accuracy (0.91 vs 0.89), precision (0.86 vs 0.77), and recall (0.71 vs 0.70) compared to the DeepEI approach. Additionally, the Lite version of the model was more than 100 times faster than the DeepEI approach in training and inference."

Since nonlinear PDEs such as the Navier-Stokes equations in fields like fluid dynamics and quantum mechanics still lack solutions, this paper addresses the long-term prediction problem of nonlinear dynamical systems by leveraging the Koopman Autoencoder (KAE) model. To improve the long-term prediction performance of KAE on nonlinear systems, we propose a multi-input-based KAE model that utilizes high temporal resolution multi-input data instead of lowering the temporal resolution of the model prediction. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through MSE, MAPE, and SMAPE metrics on three nonlinear dynamical system datasets— Navier-Stokes (smoke), Navier-Stokes (viscous flow), and Shallow-Water, showing significant improvement over baseline models."

The recommender system is proposed to identify user preferences based on past behavior and recommend suitable items. However, the effectiveness of the recommendation tends to be limited due to the data sparsity problem. To mitigate this issue, reviews have started to be widely used as a solution. Although research on review-based recommender systems is actively conducted, they ignore whether the content of reviews reflects the actual characteristics of items. In the real world, many reviews left by users may not relate to the item or fail to reflect the characteristics accurately. Therefore, this study proposes the CRARS (Content Relevance-based Adaptive Recommender System), which incorporates the relevance between review content and item features into recommendations. Specifically, we benefit from the superior ability to model interactions between features of the Co-Attention mechanism to capture this relevance. To evaluate the recommendation performance of the proposed CRARS model, we conducted extensive experiments by using data collected from Amazon.com. The experimental results indicated that the proposed CRARS model outperforms various baseline models, demonstrating the necessity of integrating the relevance between review and item into recommender systems."

Three types of defects in the h-BN monolayer (boron vacancy, nitrogen vacancy, and boron-nitrogen vacancy) were considered. The pristine h-BN monolayer had an electrical band gap of 4.6 eV, indicating its insulating properties. A monovacancy with boron or nitrogen defects introduced a new energy level within the band gap. In the case of divacancy by boron and nitrogen defects, two energy levels emerged (i.e., 1.3 eV and 1.8 eV from the conduction band, respectively) between the band gap, producing an environment conducive to electron excitation from the valence to the conduction band. As defects in the h-BN monolayer increased, the band gap filled gradually with new energy states. Consequently, the electrical properties shifted from insulator to conductor. This research contributes a methodology for predicting the material properties through computational calculations, providing insights into the evolving electrical behavior of h-BN with varying defect densities."

The proposed network was constructed using four bottleneck blocks, incorporating depth-wise separable convolution with channel expansion/projection to minimize computational costs. The performance of the proposed network was compared with other networks trained with an identical dataset. Our network demonstrated higher accuracy than other networks. It also had less trainable total parameters. Additionally, we employed the CVzone-based machine learning model to automatically detect face location. The neural network for mask recognition and the face detection model were integrated into a system for real-time door control using Arduino. Consequently, the proposed algorithm could automatically verify the wearing of masks upon entry to intensive care units, thereby preventing respiratory disease infections among patients and medical staff. The low computational cost and high accuracy of the proposed algorithm also provide excellent performance for real-time mask recognition in actual environments."

It begins her personal background as a 1.5-generation Vietnamese American and her academic engagement in immigrant faith and the challenges of teaching faith in violent contexts. The work underscores the public dimension and impact of religious education, highlighting its potential for fostering critical capacities for public engagement. However, that study observes a prevalent disconnection between congregational culture and the aim of public engagement, leading to a form of learned helplessness among students and communities. The researcher draws on Paulo Freire’s concepts of “critical hope” and the need for a curriculum that transcends mere content delivery to foster transformative engagement with societal issues. The document critiques the disimigination machine that undermines critical thinking and collective resistance, as articulated by Henry Giroux, and explores the concepts of “learned helplessness” as a barrier to environmental and social activism. The researcher advocates for a theopoetic and theopolitical approach to education that nurtures hope and practical engagement with the world’s injustice. She emphasizes small acts of theopoetic and theopolitical hope as transformative practices, using an example from Ferguson, Missouri, to illustrate how public liturgy and protest can mediate hope and justice. The document concludes with a call for a life-long, life-wide, and life-deep curriculum of enchantment towards responsible participation in societal repair, rooted in Christian hope."

However, securing actual micro-satellite SAR small-target LR images is difficult. Super-resolution (SR) technology is necessary to improve target identification performance for an SAR LR image. In this study, we obtained SR results for SAR target and background LR images, which were converted using Real-ESRGAN. We utilized Real-ESRGAN with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)-oriented model that considered the noise characteristics of scattering points when SAR images were generated, to improve the identification of the SAR target LR images. We also applied SR to MSTAR SAR target and real satellite SAR images using bicubic interpolation, Real-ESRGAN, Real-ESRNet, and Real-ESR models. Finally, we analyzed the PSNR and structural similarity (SSIM) for a similarity evaluation of the SAR SR images. The experimental results revealed an average PSNR of 25.22 dB and SSIM of 0.68 compared to the original SAR images. This indicated the effectiveness of Real-ESRGAN in removing subtle noise characteristics, owing to the more refined and high-resolution scattering points obtained with this method."

Evaluation of the YOLO models for discrimination of the alfalfa pollinating bee species,2024,['Alfalfa pollinating bee Bee recognition Computer vision Deep learning YOLO series'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Identifying insect pollinators and their roles in mediating pollen flow is critical to understand the potential gene flow risks of insect pollination-dependent crop species, such as alfalfa. This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the feasibility of You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 3 (YOLOv3), YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLO Representation (YOLOR) to discriminate the three most common alfalfa pollinating bee species, including honeybee, bumblebee, and leafcutting bee. The metrics comparison results showed YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 out performed YOLOv7 and YOLOR regarding model precision, recall, F 1 score, and mAP50 values. YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 could successfully discriminate the three different bee species with an accuracy of almost 100% (99.9%, 99.8%, and 100% accuracy for honeybee, bumblebee, and leafcutting bee for the two models, respectively).Comparatively, YOLOv7 could discriminate honeybee with an accuracy of 95% but was more likely to mistakenly discriminate bumblebee and leafcutting bee due to the relatively lower discriminating accuracy (87.3% and 66.2%, respectively). While the values of determined parameters for YOLOR were lower than YOLOv3 and YOLOv5, the higher precision (0.99680) along with recall (0.98721), F 1 (0.99198), mAP50 (0.99323), and mAP50-100 (0.89076) values indicate that this model could be able to obtain a favorable performance in discriminating the three bee species. In summary, the proposed method in this study has the potential for identifying the alfalfa pollinating bee species, studying the bees’ flower-visiting behaviors, evaluating the risks of insect-mediated pollen flow, and thus contributing to the management of genetically engineered (GE) alfalfa transgene flow."
Recent Advances in Passive Radiative Cooling: Material Design Approaches,2024,"['passive radiative cooling', 'polymer composite', 'thermal emitter', 'deep learning', 'energy harvesting']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Passive radiative cooling is a promising technology for cooling objects without energy input. Passive radiative cooling works by radiating heat from the surface, which then passes through the atmosphere and into space. Achieving efficient passive radiative cooling is mainly accomplished by using materials with high emissivity in the atmospheric window (8–13 μm). Research has shown that polymers tend to exhibit high emissivity in this spectral range. In addition to elastomers, other materials with potential for passive radiative cooling include metal oxides, carbon-based materials, and polymers. The structure of a passive radiative cooling device can affect its cooling performance. For example, a device with a large surface area will have a greater amount of surface area exposed to the sky, which increases the amount of thermal radiation emitted. Passive radiative cooling has a wide range of potential applications, including building cooling, electronics cooling, healthcare, and transportation. Current research has focused on improving the efficiency of passive radiative cooling materials and devices. With further development, passive radiative cooling can significantly affect a wide range of sectors."
Stellar SR: A Convolutional Local Feature Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution,2024,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"In contemporary single-image super-resolution applications, deep learning plays a vital role. However, existing promising super-resolution approaches cannot be deployed on edge devices due to their complexity. Although there are several lightweight super-resolution approaches, these approaches have failed to produce better performance in terms of both quality and quantity. In this work, we propose a Convolutional Block Attention Integrated Local Feature Capturing Network for lightweight image super-resolution. The main intuition behind this approach is to capture and represent the features of the low-resolution counterpart by channel and spatial attention integrated local feature network. This approach demonstrates a significant tradeoff between computational complexity and quality, surpassing the NTIRE2022 Efficient Super-Resolution Challenge winner, RLFN, in terms of parameters, FLOPs, PSNR, and SSIM."

Recently, research has actively progressed beyond the conventional classification methods towards learnable Bins. The key of this approaches lies in the Bins Optimization Module for estimating the optimal Bins, with various modules being proposed and significant advancements achieved. However, existing modules have limitations in the optimal Bins estimation, such as using the output representations of a layer of the network in a limited way(e.g. Splitter) or estimating Bins indirectly using a tool(e.g. Attractor) rather than these output representations directly estimating Bins. Therefore, to overcome the limitations described above, we propose a Deformable Cardinality Module (DCM) in which 1:1 matching of output representations and Bins is performed. This 1:1 matching method allowed the layer output representations to be independently matched and transformed within each bin, and the representations matched to each bin were estimated in the optimal direction, resulting in improved performance in MDE tasks. In addition, it is possible to estimate more precise Bins by using the Split-Transform-Conversion-Merge (STCM) strategy, which was recently proposed to improve MDE performance, and finally, through comparative experiments, it was confirmed that quantitative performance improvement and visual aspect of normal depth estimation are possible in various evaluation indicators."

However, the real fault signals differ from simulation data due to the presence of noise and uncertainty of fault parameters. As a result, the performance of previous fault classification studies based on the simulation data may not work accurately when they are used in real fault data. In this research, we compared the classification performance of some previous fault classification works based on simulation data with real fault data. The result showed that the classification performance was severely reduced with real fault data. To overcome this mismatch between simulation and real fault data, we propose a fault classification model for real fault data. The proposed classification model combined the long short-term memory (LSTM) layer and fully connected (FC) layer with different input features to train time series and non-time series features from the data. The result shows that the proposed model classifies fault type with high accuracy for both simulation data and real fault data."

This study aims to develop a real-time freight transportation route risk assessment methodology that can predict short-term traffic flows and detect crashes in advance based on factors that are complexly related to traffic safety through traffic, weather, and mobile data. First, based on real-time traffic data, Transformer-LSTM was used to predict time series traffic flow. Next, Xgboost based real-time crash prediction model for freight vehicles was developed.

This study specifically aims to ascertain if students who study academic writing using genre-based education increase both their writing performance and their sense of genre. 56 Korean undergraduate students participated in the study. Four research tools were employed in total: semi-structured interviews, student writing, student reflection, and pretest and posttest. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the writing scores of the students. Using an independent-sample design, a t-test was run to analyze the mean differences between the two groups that received various kinds of teaching. Through student comments and interviews, the awareness of genres and attitudes toward the learning process of the target students were investigated. On the basis of the findings of the pretest, this study came to the conclusion that the writing abilities of both the control group and the experimental group were comparable. The experimental group fared much better than the control group in every category of academic writing when compared to the control group. This was the case across the board. In addition, the data demonstrated that the students who were the focus of the study improved their understanding of the genre in four unique areas: textual aspects, audience awareness, purpose awareness, and permissible material. Additionally, they had a positive attitude with regard to instruction that was based on genre.

Therefore, it is important to detect equipment abnormalities in advance so that equipment failures can be predicted and repaired before they occur. Most equipment failures are caused by bearing failures, which are essential parts of equipment, and detection bearing anomaly is the essence of PHM(Prognostics and Health Management) research. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing algorithm called SWT-SVD, which analyzes vibration signals from bearings and apply it to an anomaly transformer, one of the time series anomaly detection model networks, to implement bearing anomaly detection model. Vibration signals from the bearing manufacturing process contain noise due to the real-time generation of sensor values. To reduce noise in vibration signals, we use the Stationary Wavelet Transform to extract frequency components and perform preprocessing to extract meaningful features through the Singular Value Decomposition algorithm. For experimental validation of the proposed SWT-SVD preprocessing method in the bearing anomaly detection model, we utilize the PHM-2012-Challenge dataset provided by the IEEE PHM Conference.

This method seeks to minimize color distortion and loss of detail that occur in the process of converting low-resolution images to high resolution. Our CNN model uses diverse spectral data as input to more accurately identify complex texture and color correlations within images. This creates high-resolution images with clearer, more natural colors. To achieve improved performance, super-resolution networks typically include a large number of layers and parameters, which limits their application in mobile devices. To solve this problem, we propose a nested back-projection feedback network for lightweight image super-resolution for mobile embedded systems. First, it uses back-projection feedback blocks and connection feedback to efficiently learn detailed features at various levels of the network. Second, we minimize restoration errors by proposing nested back projection suitable for lightweight networks. Finally, we propose a fusion attention module to pay more attention to information-rich features. Experimental results showed that the proposed technique showed improved visual quality and color accuracy compared to existing single spectrum-based methods."

Additionally, the conventional approach to processing numerical data involves discretization and word embedding applied sequentially. This study aims to address this gap by exploring different combinations of data transformation processes and embedding processing for numerical data. Through experimental analysis, we examine the causal relationship between these combinations and the prediction model's performance. The results indicate that the optimal combination of data transformation and embedding processing varies for each prediction model. This finding emphasizes the necessity of selecting data transformation and embedding processing combinations that align with the operational characteristics of the feature interaction algorithm during model implementation, rather than applying them as a standardized practice."
Performance Comparison of Water Body Detection from Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 Optical Imagery Using Attention U-Net Model,2024,"['Sentinel-1', 'Sentinel-2', 'Attention U-Net', 'Water body detection', 'Deep learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"As global warming accelerates greenhouse gas emissions, the frequency and severity of abnormal weather events such as floods and droughts are increasing, complicating disaster management and amplifying socio-economic damage. In response, effective strategies for mitigating water-related disasters and proactively addressing climate change are essential, which can be achieved through the use of satellite imagery. This study aims to compare the water body detection performance of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery using the Attention U-Net model. Through this comparison, the study seeks to identify the strengths and limitations of each satellite imagery type for water body detection. A 256 × 256-pixel patch dataset was developed using multi-temporal imagery from the Han River and Nakdong River basins to reflect seasonal variations in water bodies, including conditions during wet, dry, and flood seasons. Additionally, the study evaluates the impact of data augmentation techniques on model performance, emphasizing the need to select augmentation methods that align with the specific characteristics of SAR and optical data. The results demonstrate that Sentinel-1 SAR imagery exhibited stable performance in detecting large water bodies, achieving high precision in defining water boundaries (Intersection over Union [IoU]: 0.964, F1-score: 0.982). In contrast, Sentinel-2 optical imagery achieved slightly lower accuracy (IoU: 0.880, F1-score: 0.936) but performed well in detecting complex water boundaries, such as those found in wetlands and riverbanks. While data augmentation techniques improved the performance of the Sentinel-1 SAR dataset, they had only a marginal effect on Sentinel-2 optical imagery, aside from slight improvements in boundary detection under new environmental conditions. Overall, this study underscores the importance of threshold and satellite imagery integration for water body monitoring. It further emphasizes the value of selecting appropriate data augmentation techniques tailored to the characteristics of each dataset. The insights from this study offer guidance for developing enhanced water resource management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change."

To overcome this limitation, we propose a method that replicates the single-channel IR image into three channels, with each channel processed using different preprocessing techniques, such as CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), Laplacian Filter, and Top-hat transform, to improve detection performance. In this study, we utilized the RT-DETRv2 detection model and the Anti-UAV300 dataset, using IR images sampled at 10-frame intervals for our experiments.By evaluating the effects of each preprocessing technique and deriving the optimal configuration, our method achieved a 2.2% improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) over conventional methods. This confirms that our method enhances performance over simple replication, presenting a novel approach to improving object detection performance in IR imaging, with promising applications across various fields, particularly in disaster situations where infrared cameras are utilized, as well as in nighttime surveillance and reconnaissance."

We apply the class logits knowledge distillation used in the image classification task, by allowing student model mimic the classification logits of the teacher model, to guide the student model to improve the detection accuracy. In KITTI (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute) dataset, our M3KD (Multi-Scale Feature Knowledge Distillation for 3D Object Detection) student model achieves 30% inference speed improvement compared to the teacher model.Additionally, our method achieved an average improvement of 1.08% in 3D mean Average Precision (mAP) across all classes and difficulty levels compared to the baseline student model.

We use long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) architectures to evaluate the effectiveness of different activation functions and attention mechanisms. The activation functions tested include rectified linear unit (ReLU), leaky ReLU, exponential linear unit (ELU), Gaussian error linear unit (GELU), Swish, and scaled ELU (SELU), and model performance was measured using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) metrics. Our results show that the integration of attentional mechanisms improves both MAE and RMSE, with Swish and ReLU achieving the best performance for minimum temperature prediction. Conversely, GELU and ELU were less effective for pressure prediction. These results highlight the critical role of selecting appropriate activation functions and attention mechanisms in improving model accuracy for complex time-series forecasting."

Recently, 3D-GS (3D Gaussian Splatting) has gained popularity due to its faster training and inference times compared to those of NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)-based methodologies. However, since 3D-GS reconstructs a 3D (Three-Dimensional) scene by splitting and cloning (Density Control) Gaussian points, the number of Gaussian points continuously increases, causing the model to become heavier as training progresses. To address this issue, we propose two methodologies: 1) Gaussian blending, an improved density control methodology that removes unnecessary Gaussian points, and 2) a performance enhancement methodology using a depth estimation model to minimize the loss in representation caused by the blending of Gaussian points. Experiments on the Tanks and Temples Dataset show that the proposed methodologies reduce the number of Gaussian points by up to 4% while maintaining performance."

The various architectures of the ViT-based model were constructed by varying the number of encoder blocks, and different patch sizes were applied for network training. Also, the performance of the ViT-based model was compared to the CNN-based models, such as VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet. The results showed that the traninig efficiency and accuracy of the ViT-based model depended on the number of encoder blocks and the patch size, and the F1 scores of the ViT-based model ranged from 0.875 to 0.919. The training effeciency of the ViT-based model with a large patch size was superior to the CNN-based models, and the pneumonia detection accuracy of the ViT-based model was higher than that of the VGGNet.

Poor wire harness quality is directly linked to product failure, fire, and personal injury, so quality control is key to preventing this. In the wire harness manufacturing process, quality inspection is especially important for crimp harnesses, which are the product of the crimping process that crimp terminals onto stripped wire cables. In this paper, we propose a U-net encoder-based ensemble method for crimping process quality inspection. The ensemble method combines several different U-net structures to produce a more accurate final prediction. The ensemble weight calculation algorithm determines the ensemble weights, firstly, through the average values of IoU, F1 score, recall, and precision of the U-Net models, and secondly, by penalizing the models with lower average values of IoU. The analysis of the ensemble method using crimped harness images obtained from a wire harness manufacturing plant showed that the discrimination accuracy reached 95.41%. The proposed method overcomes the shortcomings of existing methods and offers the possibility of reducing costs while maintaining consistently high quality."

Current approaches encounter challenges such as boundary artifacts, loss of detailed information, and inaccurate localization of focused regions, leading to suboptimal fusion outcomes necessitating subsequent post-processing interventions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel multi-focus image fusion technique leveraging the Swin Transformer architecture. This method integrates a frequency layer utilizing Wavelet Transform, enhancing performance in comparison to conventional Swin Transformer configurations. Additionally, to mitigate the deficiency of local detail information within the attention mechanism, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are incorporated to enhance region recognition accuracy. Comparative evaluations of various fusion methods across three datasets were conducted in the paper. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed model outperformed existing techniques, yielding superior quality in the resultant fused images."

Moreover, users can set the size and intensity of the desired deformations based on their input parameters, ensuring proper deformations for various sizes of correction areas. The intensity of the deformation diminishes as it moves away from the center of the deformation area, using the Manhattan distance between coordinates as a weight for the deformation intensity. Lastly, transformations can be performed in interactive time through parallel processing using a GPU."
DNN-Based Force Estimation in Hyper-Redundant Manipulators,2024,"['Hyper-redundant manipulator', 'Minimally invasive surgery', 'Surgical robot', 'Force estimation', 'Machine learning']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Hyper-redundant manipulators (HRMs) have been applied to many robotic surgery platforms because they can be bent in various directions as they consist of many rigid segments and are operated in a cable-driven manner, allowing remote placement of actuators. However, due to the long kinematic chain and wire stretching when subjected to force, HRMs have disadvantages, including inaccurate positioning and difficulty in building physics-based models. These constraints pose challenges in realizing force feedback using HRMs. In this paper, we present a deep neural network (DNN) based estimation system for the external force exerted on the distal end of the HRMs using tensions and fixed positions of the cables as input data, which can be measured outside the human body. To generate a training dataset for DNN, a physics-based HRM model considering external forces, cable tensions, cable friction, and cable extension was developed. We also proposed the iterative optimization algorithm for the optimal configuration of the HRM. The training dataset was produced through simulation using the physics-based HRM model, and then the DNN-based force estimation model was trained. The HRM prototype was fabricated to verify the reliability of the training dataset and evaluate the performance of the DNN-based force estimation model. The estimated magnitude and angle errors of the external force were 4.8% and 10.4% on average, respectively. This demonstrates the feasibility of measuring the external force without force/torque sensors, which can help realize force feedback in HRMs."

However, sounds collected in outdoor settings often include substantial background noise, complicating the task for a single model. In addition, data imbalance among species may lead to biased model training. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an animal sound classification scheme that combines predictions from multiple models using Focal Loss, which adjusts penalties based on class data volume. Experiments on public datasets have demonstrated that our scheme can improve recall by up to 22.6% compared to an average of single models."

These characteristics can be crucial clues in identifying suspects at crime scenes and establishing their connection to the crime. In the process of acquiring fingerprint images at crime scenes, various sensors, lighting conditions, etc. can create images with different characteristics. In this situation, a cross-domain fingerprint recognition problem may arise. Cross-domain fingerprint recognition problems are caused by the technical differences of various sensors and changes in the experimental environment, which reduce the accuracy of the fingerprint recognition model. In this paper, we propose an effective data augmentation method to solve this cross-domain fingerprint recognition problem. Experimental results show that the Sharpen augmentation method improves the accuracy by more than 2% when EfficientNet-B0 is used as a backbone, and the MedianBlur augmentation method improves the accuracy by more than 3% when AFR-Net is used as a backbone.

Recent studies have extended plant disease recognition from traditional closed-set scenarios to open-set environments, where the goal is to reject samples that do not belong to known categories. However, in open-world tasks, it is essential not only to define unknown samples as ""unknown"" but also to classify them further. This task assumes that images and labels of known categories are available and that samples of unknown categories can be accessed. The model classifies unknown samples by learning the prior knowledge of known categories. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing research on this topic in plant-related recognition tasks.To address this gap, this paper utilizes knowledge distillation to model the category space relationships between known and unknown categories. Specifically, we identify similarities between different species or diseases. By leveraging a fine-tuned model on known categories, we generate pseudo-labels for unknown categories. Additionally, we enhance the baseline method's performance by using a larger pre-trained model, dino-v2. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the large plant specimen dataset Herbarium19 and the disease dataset Plant Village. Notably, our method outperforms the baseline by 1% to 20% in terms of accuracy for novel category classification. We believe this study will contribute to the community."

ECG signals are unique to each individual and are difficult to replicate and manipulate, making them a promising candidate for new authentication methods.

To address these challenges, we developed a novel approach that integrates a sequence-to-sequence Transformer architecture with the Vision Transformer (ViT) model to achieve enhanced authentication speed and efficiency. The Sequence-to-Sequence structure allows input ECG signals to be processed in short patches by the transformer model, enabling real-time analysis of electrocardiogram signals. In addition, we employed masking techniques to tokenized input patches, enabling the model to authenticate early even when only partial ECG signals are available. The model’s performance at a sequence length of 3 is as follows: accuracy 98.8%, precision 100%, recall 97.62%, and F1-score 98.8%. We expect that by inputting three bits of the measured electrocardiogram signals into the proposed model, it will be able to authenticate users quickly and accurately."

Meteorological data from the Korea Meteorological Administration and solar power generation data from the Korea Power Exchange were utilized for the period from January 2017 to May 2023, considering both inland (Daejeon) and coastal (Busan) regions. Temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation were selected as relevant meteorological variables for solar power prediction. All data was preprocessed by removing their systematic components to use only their residuals and the residual of solar data were further processed with weighted adjustments for homoscedasticity. Four models, MLR (Multiple Linear Regression), RF (Random Forest), DNN (Deep Neural Network), and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), were employed for solar power prediction and their performances were evaluated based on predicted values utilizing observed meteorological data (used as a reference), 1-day-ahead forecast data (referred to as fore1), and 2-day-ahead forecast data (fore2). DNN-based prediction model exhibits superior performance in both regions, with RNN performing the least effectively. However, MLR and RF demonstrate competitive performance comparable to DNN. The disparities in the performance of the four different models are less pronounced than anticipated, underscoring the pivotal role of fitting models using residuals. This emphasizes that the utilized preprocessing approach, specifically leveraging residuals, is poised to play a crucial role in the future of solar power generation forecasting."

To address this issue, this study proposes a method to optimize the image fusion process by leveraging the global feature extraction capabilities of the transformer model and utilizing a loss function derived from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). First, a FeatureGuided Transformer (FGT) module is developed to extract and interact with both local and global information from the images. Then, a Feature Dynamic Fusion (FDF) module is designed to adaptively fuse the two different types of images. Additionally, the method incorporates a combination of mathematical loss functions and language-based loss functions to simultaneously enhance the visual quality and semantic content of the fused images. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing fusion methods in terms of subjective evaluations."

This paper proposes a system that utilizes artificial intelligence technology on CCTV footage to automatically detect the moment of a 'hit-and-run' incident and track the offending vehicle. Upon receiving CCTV footage, the system undergoes processes of selecting the victim vehicle, estimating the time of the accident, and estimating the offending vehicle, thereby detecting the most probable hit-and-run offending vehicle. To address the vulnerabilities of existing vehicle accident detection methods and to reduce errors caused by irrelevant surrounding objects, the process of object segmentation and detection models, as well as object tracking and depth estimation models, were introduced to separately classify surrounding objects. Additionally, to enhance the detection performance of domestic vehicles captured in CCTV footage, a separate dataset was compiled to improve object detection performance. When this system was applied to actual hit-and-run cases recorded by CCTV, it accurately detected the time of the accident and demonstrated a processing speed of over 27fps in HD resolution video."

However, the comprehensive annotation of sentiment values for all content often necessitates manual intervention, which is not cost-effective. As a result, the frequent absence of sentiment annotations in multimodal datasets poses a significant challenge to the performance of sentiment-based search and prediction models. To address this issue, it becomes essential to impute missing sentiment values to enhance the efficacy of sentiment-based analyses. The primary objective of this study is to propose a novel sentiment imputation method tailored for multimodal sentiment analysis. Specifically, we introduce an imputation approach based on the VisualBERT framework. To further augment the semantic richness of 3D asset information, we leverage the Large Language-and-Vision Assistant (LLaVA), a Large Multimodal Model (LMM), to extract sentiment-related textual information from 3D asset images. This extracted information is then integrated with both the image data and the descriptive metadata of the 3D assets. Empirical evaluations conducted on real-world 3D asset datasets demonstrate that the proposed sentiment imputation method significantly outperforms existing competitive approaches that rely solely on image or text-based imputation techniques."

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates Variational Autoencoders (VAE)[1] and Surpport Vector Data Description (SVDD)[2].

Because most NAS algorithms are time-consuming, finding out a way to reduce their computation costs has now become a critical research issue. The training-free method (also called the zero-shot learning) provides an alternative way to estimate how good a neural architecture is more efficiently during the process of NAS by using a lightweight score function instead of a general training process to avoid incurring heavy costs. This paper starts with a brief discussion of DNN and NAS, followed by a brief review of both model-dependent and model-independent training-free score functions. A brief introduction to the search algorithms and benchmarks that were widely used in a training-free NAS will also be given in this paper.

To address these issues, we employ the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN), which enhances sharpness and is well-suited for generating high-resolution images. As part of our SRCNN-based image data augmentation techniques, we introduce Affine Transformations and Noise Injection methods, specifically Salt and Pepper Noise. These data augmentation methods aim to train the model on diverse image data, incorporating variations in angles and sizes, and increasing data diversity by introducing white or black pixels to the images. We advocate for an improved dataset training approach, enhancing the generalization capability of the existing SRCNN learning model."

First, the skin condition of the elderly varies depending on the age, gender, and lifestyle of the subjects, so it is necessary to accurately diagnose and analyze the skin in advance to support customized beauty care. Second, aging skin is more likely to have an imbalance of oil and moisture compared to other ages, so a care program that can restore it is necessary. Third, a special care program should be implemented for wrinkles, elasticity, and pigmentation. In conclusion, in order to manage aging skin healthily, digital technology should be used to diagnose skin types more accurately and build management programs accordingly. The elderly living alone are often emotionally depressed and have low self-esteem. They need customized beauty care, but currently, beauty care services are mainly centered on hair care, so it is necessary to activate service support in the area of skin care.

A study on the quantificational interpretation of donkey phrase in English: utilizing Next Sentence Prediction with BERT,2024,"['donkey sentence', 'quantificational interpretation', 'ChatGPT', 'BERT', 'Next Sentence Prediction']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The goal of the current paper is to explore the interpretation pattern of four different types of quantificational meaning (universal/existential/deictic/generic) of the donkey phrase in English. Specifically, we utilize two deep learning language models: ChatGPT and BERT. A dataset comprising a total of 240 sentences, with 60 sentences generated by ChatGPT, underwent Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) analysis with BERT. The statistical examination, based on surprisal values, revealed a hierarchy of low surprisal values signifying high acceptability in quantificational interpretations: existential > universal > deictic > generic. Regarding the configurations of definite NP and pronouns in the donkey phrase, stand-alone sentences favored pronoun usage, while in NSP, definite NP demonstrated a more innate acceptability. This implies that, even in theoretical analysis, the E-type theory employing quantifier expressions may present a more fitting framework for donkey phrases compared to the discourse representation theory utilizing bound variable pronouns."

To this end, first, Chusa’s view of learning and Buddhism was examined through his life. Chusa tried an objective approach to the study of sutras, epigraphs, art, and Buddhist studies, with the attitude of research on Empirical tradition. He also had a deep understanding of Buddhism, especially in affirming both Confucianism and Buddhism, and took an attitude of reconciling them. Next, the significance of Chusa and Baekpa’s Debate on Seon was discussed. Through his criticism of Baekpa, Chusa raised the issue that Seon Buddhism at the time had to be reviewed through history and facts, not experience and tradition. In particular, in the controversy over Seon with the Baekpa, he openly criticized the issue of Seon, which was claimed by the Baekpa at the time, based on the historical research point of view. Lastly, Chusa’s perception of Ganhwaseon was examined. Chusa not only criticized Ganhwaseon again by using the terms that Dahui Zonggao criticized Silent-Penetrate Seon, but also said that the Gongan itself used in Ganhwaseon was a meaningless word without any content. Overall, Chusa’s critical view of Seon study was about how to position Seon in the reality of the time through questions such as ‘What is Seon study?’, ‘What is the essence of Seon study?’, and ‘What is Ganhwaseon?’ In particular, regardless of the outcome of the debate, it is significant in that it shows a new form of debate that corresponds to the pioneering of historical methodology and philosophical hermeneutics about 110 years before the controversy over the study of Seon study between Hushi and D.

These comments, sometimes known as e-commerce reviews, influence other customers' purchasing decisions. To confront large amounts of e-commerce reviews, automatic analysis based on machine learning and deep learning draws more and more attention. A core task therein is sentiment analysis. However, the e-commerce reviews exhibit the following characteristics: (1) inconsistency between comment content and the star rating; (2) a large number of unlabeled data, i.e., comments without a star rating, and (3) the data imbalance caused by the sparse negative comments. This paper employs Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), one of the best natural language processing models, as the base model. According to the above data characteristics, we propose the F_MixBERT framework, to more effectively use inconsistently low-quality and unlabeled data and resolve the problem of data imbalance. In the framework, the proposed MixBERT incorporates the MixMatch approach into BERT’s high-dimensional vectors to train the unlabeled and low-quality data with generated pseudo labels. Meanwhile, data imbalance is resolved by Focal loss, which penalizes the contribution of large-scale data and easily-identifiable data to total loss.

Zu den wichtigsten Inhalten gehören die Definition des Begriffs der künstlichen Intelligenz und die Unterscheidung zwischen künstlicher Intelligenz, die besonders in die Grundrechte der Bürger eingreift. Derzeit ist der Einsatz von künstlicher Intelligenz im Zusammenhang mit Verwaltungsakten im Verwaltungsgrundgesetz unter dem Begriff der automatischen Verfügungen geregelt, und die Bestimmungen dieses Artikels sehen vor, dass vollautomatische Verfügungen unter Einsatz künstlicher Intelligenz nur bei gebundenen Verwaltungsakten, nicht aber bei Ermessenshandlungen erlassen werden können. Es ist notwendig, den Erlass von Verwaltungsakten unter Einsatz von KI bei Ermessensentscheidungen zu ermöglichen, und es ist auch notwendig, den Schutz der anderen Partei des Verwaltungsverfahrens nach dem koreanischen Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz bei Verwaltungsakten unter Einsatz von KI zu harmonisieren.In Anbetracht der Tatsache, dass das Zeitalter der künstlichen Intelligenz immer näher rückt, müssen systematischere Regeln für den Einsatz von künstlicher Intelligenz im Verwaltungshandeln entwickelt werden."

Nowdays, deep learning technoloiges with the theory have been used for the system identification. We herein aim to review a model named as Koopman Autoencoder (KAE), which is considered to be baseline in the literature, and propose a new training/inference strategy to improve the performance of KAE for future estimation.

Moreover, Western science technology and culture had been gradually introduced into China by this time. The Korean envoys of the Daoguang period had a broader international perspective than earlier envoys and were able to view the Qing Dynasty and themselves in a more diverse cultural context. In the twelfth year of Daoguang (1832), Jin Jingshan went to China as the Condescendence official and collected what he saw and heard in China as YanYuanZhiZhi, in which he describes the real style of Beijing in the Daoguang period with keen observations and deep insight, which gives this work high research value.the image of Beijing described by Jin Jingshan has the following aspects: First, Beijing was a magnificent city with a rich culture and a long history that had not lost the style of the imperial capital. Second, it was a society where east met west. In Beijing, where envoys from various countries lived, various cultures met and collided. However, due to the limitations of the time, Jin Jingshan’s acceptance of western scientific knowledge remained at the level of objects, and he thus failed to realize that great changes in the world were underway. Third, Beijing hosted a bustling and luxurious market. The shops presented a carnival scene: abundant material and people, a wide range of goods, well-developed and smooth trade, and people living and working in peace and contentment. However, hidden behind this grandiosity was the crisis of luxury and irreconcilable contradiction between Manchu and Han, which revealed the inevitability of the Qing Dynasty’s decline. Fourth was the magnificent landscape. On the one hand, Jin Jingshan admired the magnificent beauty of the landscape and the great national strength and superb skills behind it; on the other hand, the rulers who built these landscapes were evaluated as profligate. This contradictory attitude embodies Jin Jingshan’s wavering between two views of China, “the differentiation of Hua & Yi” and “the China of Northern Learning,” which were the common conceptions of Korean envoys during the Daoguang period who tried to separate the high skills of the Qing Dynasty from its barbarian culture."

Methods : The present study recruited 89 children, including 33 diagnosed with DD, and 56 TD children. The aim was to examine the effectiveness of a deep learning classification model using facial video collected from children through mobile-based application. The study participants underwent comprehensive developmental assessments, which included the child completion of the Korean Psychoedu-cational Profile-Revised and caregiver completing the Korean versions of Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Korean version of the Child-hood Autism Rating Scale, Social Responsiveness Scale, and Child Behavior Checklist. We extracted facial landmarks from recorded vid-eos using mobile application and performed DDs classification using long short-term memory with stratified 5-fold cross-validation.Results : The classification model shows an average accuracy of 0.88 (range: 0.78–1.00), an average precision of 0.91 (range: 0.75–1.00), and an average F1-score of 0.80 (range: 0.60–1.00). Upon interpreting prediction results using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we verified that the most crucial variable was the nodding head angle variable, with a median SHAP score of 2.6. All the top 10 contributing variables exhibited significant differences in distribution between children with DD and TD (p<0.05).Conclusion : The results of this study provide evidence that facial landmarks, utilizing readily available mobile-based video data, can be used to detect DD at an early stage."
Dual-stream Co-enhanced Network for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation,2024,"['Unsupervised video object segmentation', 'Dual-stream Co-enhanced', 'Motion refinement', 'Feature aggregation', 'Dual-stream neural network']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) is a highly challenging problem in computer vision as the annotation of the target object in the testing video is unknown at all. The main difficulty is to effectively handle the complicated and changeable motion state of the target object and the confusion of similar background objects in video sequence. In this paper, we propose a novel deep Dual-stream Co-enhanced Network (DC-Net) for UVOS via bidirectional motion cues refinement and multi-level feature aggregation, which can fully take advantage of motion cues and effectively integrate different level features to produce high-quality segmentation mask. DC-Net is a dual-stream architecture where the two streams are co-enhanced by each other. One is a motion stream with a Motion-cues Refine Module (MRM), which learns from bidirectional optical flow images and produces fine-grained and complete distinctive motion saliency map, and the other is an appearance stream with a Multi-level Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM) and a Context Attention Module (CAM) which are designed to integrate the different level features effectively. Specifically, the motion saliency map obtained by the motion stream is fused with each stage of the decoder in the appearance stream to improve the segmentation, and in turn the segmentation loss in the appearance stream feeds back into the motion stream to enhance the motion refinement. Experimental results on three datasets (Davis2016, VideoSD, SegTrack-v2) demonstrate that DC-Net has achieved comparable results with some state-of-the-art methods."
Dynamic SFC placement with parallelized VNFs in Data Center Networks: A DRL-based approach,2024,['Data Center NetworkService Function ChainPlacementVirtual Network FunctionsParallelized VNFs'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology can tie together a set of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) as a Service Function Chain (SFC). Although NFV is a promising technology for the placement of user service requests, SFCs often suffer from high delay and low throughput. This paper develops an efficient approach based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with the aim of deploying VNFs with low delay during heterogeneous bandwidth demands in Data Center Networks (DCNs). We design an architecture that exploits the dependencies of VNFs to parallelize them and also preserve more resources for processing future requests by extracting the distribution of initialized VNFs. Our algorithm is expected to maximize the long-term reward and improve the computational acceleration in provisioning user service requests. Our evaluations show that the proposed algorithm reduces the service delay by 12% through parallelized VNFs."

Improving Accuracy in Detecting Unknown Objects and Enhancing Low Visibility Conditions Caused by Sea Fog in Coastal Areas,2024,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"South Korea’s geographical position, flanked by the sea on three sides, coupled with the ongoing standoff between the North and the South, makes coastal security a critical component of national defense. However, challenges in coastal operations arise due to aging military equipment and a decrease in military personnel due to low birth rates. In this context, this paper presents automated technology based on deep learning as an alternative to manpower. In coastal areas, low visibility conditions frequently occur due to sea fog, a climatic characteristic of these regions. To address this issue, the Dehazy algorithm, a technique for fog removal, has been implemented. Additionally, an algorithm that separates the background by distinguishing between the sea and sky at the horizon has been combined to selectively identify objects over the sea. For object detection, the YOLO algorithm was employed, and this paper highlights the differences in object recognition rates and real-time processing speeds between identifying unknown objects in original images versus those detected using the proposed technology."

Students learned the rules and strategies of audiovisual translation in the theory class and then used them as the basis for practical translation assignments. The translation assignments were based on the Japanese animations ""Your Name"" and ""Spirited Away"" and presented their translation strategy and the translated sentences. After the presentation, the students presented the translated example sentences and exchanged various opinions through peer review by their fellow learners. Through this series of processes, the class was designed to produce audiovisual translation results of higher quality than existing translations.As a result of the class, it was confirmed that the learners' translation and analytical skills were remarkable, and that their speed of improvement was very fast. The learners corrected mistranslations of existing translations appropriately and proposed innovative and appropriate alternatives for areas that did not fall within the scope of mistranslations but still needed improvement. The strategies used in the translation were logical and convincing. The level of discussion among fellow students was significantly high, and the process of adopting the best alternative after several rounds of discussion was extremely rational.Compared to the rapidly increasing Japanese audiovisual market in Korea, the number of Japanese audiovisual translators is limited. To resolve this imbalance between supply and demand, it is necessary to systematically foster next-generation translators with an innovative sense and a deep understanding of the Japanese language and culture. The results of this study can be an example of supporting the legitimacy of fostering talented translators with young sensibilities in the Japanese audiovisual market in Korea."

This allows us to recognize that Luke not only had excellent rhetorical skills due to his high level of Greek education, but also had a deep understanding of the law despite being a Gentile.Luke asserted the tradition and authority of his writings and unfolded the structure of the overall story through the use of Biblical language and archetypes or through indirect quotations because he had thorough knowledge of the Old Testament. Luke summarizes the Bible that the readers know and uses tools such as sermons or speech forms including prophecies, travel, continuity, and parallel structure to increase readers’ interest in the book of Acts, which contain the story of salvation. Therefore, this study aimed to research the text written by Luke with a framework of continuity among the writing styles, such as techniques for conveying the story and approaching to events, and methods of expression when unfolding the history of God’s salvation that he has learned, experienced, believed in and understood.In the Gospel, Luke deals with the story of Jesus’ ministry in Galilee and Jerusalem, and the preaching of the gospel of repentance to his disciples after Jesus’ death and resurrection starting with the story of Jesus’ public life with the birth of John the Baptist and Jesus.In the following introduction to book of Acts. Luke tells several independent stories such as the resurrected Jesus proclaiming his disciples to go to the ends of the earth with the gospel of Jesus that seem unrelated to the disciples’ process of expanding and unfolding the story of Jesus’ salvation. In this way, Luke uses a variety of writing devices, such as a sudden start to the story, the appearance of an important character, or a twist, to make each story more moving and dramatic. At the same time, Luke emphasizes that God’s promise to Israel through the prophets of the Old Testament is fulfilled through Jesus, and that fulfillment is expanded through the disciples. The fact that this achievement was the fulfillment of God’s past promise to Israel is repeatedly conveyed to readers through various events and stories in the text. It is discovered that Luke describes it as a structure of continuity between Old Testament prophecy and Luke’s Gospel and Acts as he consistently unfolds the story of God’s salvation. Behind this, it is found that the basic premise and understanding of the continuous structure of prophecy and fulfillment lies in the stories of the prophets, Jesus, and the disciples."

A high-density gamma white spots-Gaussian mixture noise removal method for neutron images denoising based on Swin Transformer UNet and Monte Carlo calculation,2024,"['Neutron images', 'Image denoising', 'SUNet', 'Monte Carlo calculation', 'Gamma white spots', 'Gaussian noise']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"During fast neutron imaging, besides the dark current noise and readout noise of the CCD camera, the main noise in fast neutron imaging comes from high-energy gamma rays generated by neutron nuclear reactions in and around the experimental setup. These high-energy gamma rays result in the presence of high-density gamma white spots (GWS) in the fast neutron image. Due to the microscopic quantum characteristics of the neutron beam itself and environmental scattering effects, fast neutron images typically exhibit a mixture of Gaussian noise. Existing denoising methods in neutron images are difficult to handle when dealing with a mixture of GWS and Gaussian noise. Herein we put forward a deep learning approach based on the Swin Transformer UNet (SUNet) model to remove high-density GWS-Gaussian mixture noise from fast neutron images. The improved denoising model utilizes a customized loss function for training, which combines perceptual loss and mean squared error loss to avoid grid-like artifacts caused by using a single perceptual loss. To address the high cost of acquiring real fast neutron images, this study introduces Monte Carlo method to simulate noise data with GWS characteristics by computing the interaction between gamma rays and sensors based on the principle of GWS generation. Ultimately, the experimental scenarios involving simulated neutron noise images and real fast neutron images demonstrate that the proposed method not only improves the quality and signal-to-noise ratio of fast neutron images but also preserves the details of the original images during denoising."

Wildfires occur frequently in South Korea, especially during the spring season. This study assessed post-wildfires areas in Gangneung, South Korea, on April 11, 2023, which were generated by implementing remote sensing technology and statistical analysis. Remote sensing and classification techniques, including PlanetScope, have been developed for identifying wildfire-damaged areas. The method for classifying post-wildfire mapping estimation includes the utilization of deep learning approaches, especially using the U-Net architecture. Therefore, the assessment of wildfire severity can be conducted using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-5P imagery in addition to an analysis of the vegetation type and air pollutant within the affected region. In the present study, Sentinel-2 imagery was to generate spectral indices, including the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR), differenced normalized difference moisture index (dNDMI), differenced soil adjusted vegetation index (dSAVI), and differenced normalized vegetation index (dNDVI). Sentinel-5P imagery was utilized to produce carbon monoxide (CO) column number densities. The estimation of wildfire areas was conducted using a PlanetScope classified image with the U-Net classifier, which was evaluated based on the overall accuracy value of 95% and kappa accuracy of 0.901. The wildfire severity level was shown by dNBR, which was correlated with the parameters, including RBR, dNDMI, dSAVI, dNDVI, and CO. The statistical analysis demonstrated a significant and positive correlation between the wildfire severity and the parameters. Moreover, the average of vegetation indices (NDMI, SAVI, and NDVI) before and after a wildfire were found to decrease by vegetation type, including 17.55% in mixed barren land areas, 17.49% in other grasses, 24.71% in mixed forest land, 22.48% in coniferous land, 13.48% in fields, and 4.29% in paddy fields.

Artificial neural network-based sequential approximate optimization of metal sheet architecture and forming process,2024,"['discrete design optimization', 'surrogate model', 'artificial neural network', 'metamaterials', 'multi-stage metal forming', 'dynamic differential evolution', 'finite element method']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper introduces a sequential approximate optimization method that combines the finite element method (FEM), dynamic differential evolution (DDE), and artificial neural network (ANN) surrogate models. The developed method is applied to address two optimization problems. The first involves metamaterial design optimization for metal sheet architecture with binary design variables. The second pertains to optimizing process parameters in multi-stage metal forming, where the discrete nature arises owing to changing tool geometries across stages. This process is highly non-linear, accumulating contact, geometric, and material non-linear effects discretely through forming stages. The efficacy of the proposed optimization method, utilizing ANN surrogate models, is compared with traditionally used polynomial response surface (PRS) surrogate models, primarily based on low-order polynomials. Efficient learning of ANN surrogate models is facilitated through the FEM and Python integration framework. Initial data for surrogate model training are collected via Latin hypercube sampling and FEM simulations. DDE is employed for sequential approximate optimization, optimizing ANN or PRS surrogate models to determine optimal design variables. PRS surrogate models encounter challenges in dealing with non-linear changes in sequential approximate optimization concerning discrete characteristics such as binary design variables and discrete non-linear behavior found in multi-stage metal forming processes. Owing to the discrete nature, PRS surrogate models require more data and iterations for optimal design variables. In contrast, ANN surrogate models adeptly predict non-linear behavior through the activation function’s characteristics. In the optimization problem of metal sheet architecture for design Target C, the ANN surrogate model required an average of 4.6 times fewer iterations to satisfy stopping criteria compared with the PRS surrogate model. Furthermore, in the optimization of multi-stage deep drawing processes, the ANN surrogate model required an average of 6.1 times fewer iterations to satisfy stopping criteria compared with the PRS surrogate model. As a result, the sequential global optimization method utilizing ANN surrogate models achieves optimal design variables with fewer iterations than PRS surrogate models. Further confirmation of the method’s efficiency is provided by comparing Pearson correlation coefficients and locus plots."

However, the inclusion of the unrealistic trolley dillemma and the dubious ethics of AI/Robot in discussion of the satety regulation of AVs causes confusion, leading to many pointless and unnecessary debates. The trolley dilemma, which is nothing more than a hypothetical accident experiment, only causes confusion without any benefit in the context of AVs. Deep learning AI technology for collision avoidance has nothing to do with discrimination and human rights. In South Korea, however, the two guidelines for AVs of 2020 co-published by the government and other research group mistakenly demand a resolution to the unrealistic trolley dilemma and address dubious concerns of AI/Robot. A misguided focus on the trolley problem and AI/Robot ethics could hinder the social acceptance of AVs even before AD technology is fully developed. While there are safety concerns related AI for collision avoidance, attaining ‘zero risk’ is an impractical goal. Demanding zero risk would prohibit the deployment of AVs. Therefore, achieving a consensus on ‘acceptable positive risk’, both technically and socially, is imperative for the successful deployment of AVs.

EEG signals, known for their inherent individual variability, are initially transformed into Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, which are natu- rally represented on a Riemannian manifold. To mitigate the variability between sessions and subjects, we employ RPA, a method that geometrically aligns the statistical distributions of these matrices on the manifold. This alignment is designed to reduce individual differences and improve the accuracy of EEG signal classification. SPD-Net, a deep learning archi- tecture that maintains the Riemannian structure of the data, is then used for classification. We compare its performance with the Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM) classifier, a conventional method rooted in Riemannian geometry. The ex- perimental results demonstrate that incorporating RPA as a preprocessing step enhances the classification accuracy of SPD-Net, validating that the alignment of statistical distributions on the Riemannian manifold is an effective strategy for improving EEG-based BCI systems.

Accurate and swift recognition of current weather conditions and adaptive clarification of surveillance videos are crucial to maintaining the integrity of spatial information. Addressing the limitations of traditional weather recognition methods and the scarcity of weather image datasets, a multicategory weather image block dataset was constructed. This research introduced a weather recognition algorithm that integrates image block processing with feature fusion. The algorithm uses traditional methods to extract shallow spatial features such as average gradient, contrast, saturation, and dark channel from weather images. It also employs transfer learning to fine-tune a pretrained VGG16 model, extracting deep spatial features from the model’s fully connected layers. The approach improves the SoftMax classifier’s recognition of fog, rain, snow, and clear weather photos by merging shallow and deep spatial information. This improvement is essential for the quality and reliability of spatial data in bad weather. The algorithm achieves 99.26% accuracy in weather detection; however, the best accuracy archive by state of art is 97.14%, confirming its usefulness as a module for adaptive video picture clarification in spatially informed systems."

Additionally, the effect of generalist CEOs is strengthened when they have an output-oriented functional background, while production-oriented and peripheral backgrounds have a weaker or non-significant influence. By employing deep learning models to measure CEO functional experience diversity, this study provides new insights into how leadership diversity shapes market communication and information transparency, particularly in emerging markets like China. The findings have important implications for corporate governance and the role of executive leadership in enhancing market efficiency."

Street-level features primarily include the built environment elements that makes up the streets, such as greenery, sky, and other elements. As users of urban street spaces, travelers perception indicators of various streets also include subjective perspectives describing the differential characteristics among urban streets. Therefore, this study focuses on exploring the impact of the street built-environment and travelers perception indicators on the crash frequencies. The modeling process considers severity levels related to traffic crashes and then extends analysis to geospatial dimension to account for the spatial heterogeneity and correlation of coefficients. The study uses 587 road segments in the central area of Daejeon in Korea, with traffic crash data from the full year of 2019. All crashes are classified into killed/severe injury (KSI) and slight injury. Street built-environment elements are extracted from the street view images of the studied road sections using semantic segmentation technology, while street perception indicators are scored using deep learning methods based on the street view images, outputting results in six perceptual dimensions to create related variables. In addition, the impact of traffic variables such as AADT and road geometry (number of lanes, speed limits, etc.) is considered. The results suggest significant correlations among street built-environment, travelers perception indicators and the frequency of traffic crashes, with different trends of impact for various crash classification. The estimation results of coefficients also show variations in the spatial influence of different feature, which could help traffic authorities identify high-risk areas and understand contributing factors, thereby taking precaution actions."

Computation Offloading with Resource Allocation Based on DDPG in MEC,2024,"['Computation Offloading', 'DDPG', 'MEC', 'Resource Allocation']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Recently, multi-access edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technology to alleviate the computing burden of vehicular terminals and efficiently facilitate vehicular applications. The vehicle can improve the quality of experience of applications by offloading their tasks to MEC servers. However, channel conditions are time-varying due to channel interference among vehicles, and path loss is time-varying due to the mobility of vehicles. The task arrival of vehicles is also stochastic. Therefore, it is difficult to determine an optimal offloading with resource allocation decision in the dynamic MEC system because offloading is affected by wireless data transmission. In this paper, we study computation offloading with resource allocation in the dynamic MEC system. The objective is to minimize power consumption and maximize throughput while meeting the delay constraints of tasks. Therefore, it allocates resources for local execution and transmission power for offloading. We define the problem as a Markov decision process, and propose an offloading method using deep reinforcement learning named deep deterministic policy gradient. Simulation shows that, compared with existing methods, the proposed method outperforms in terms of throughput and satisfaction of delay constraints."

At the time, the engineers who actually built Western-style buildings were traditional Japanese carpenters. They learned Western architectural techniques in a short period of time and combined them with traditional Japanese wooden architectural styles and techniques to create a new style known as quasi-Western style architecture. The primary reason Japanese carpenters could create and apply Western-style architecture in such a short period of time was that the Western architecture introduced at that time was colonial-style wooden architecture. In Japan, which has a long tradition of wooden architecture, excellent building wood was produced in abundance, and afforestation technology had developed well before the medieval times. Based on a deep understanding of wood, traditional Japanese carpenters systematically developed and accumulated techniques to build wooden structures of various sizes and complex shapes up to the modern era. During the Edo period, various architectural technical texts were published, and a system was established for carpenters to win construction orders through technological competition. In modern times, just as Japan had adopted Korean and Chinese architecture in ancient and medieval times, it actively accepted and learned Western architecture according to its needs and made it uniquely Japanese. Based on this historical background, traditional Japanese carpenters were able to learn the construction technology of Western architecture in a short period of time and create a new style of quasi-Western style architecture."

To address this, a method is proposed in this paper to identify fish hunger levels using machine vision and predict the dissolved oxygen concentration in real time to prevent mass fish mortality due to water quality deterioration, even with additional feed supply. The method aims to verify its performance. Firstly, based on the observation that aquaculture farm operators estimate fish hunger levels by feeding time, a method is proposed to estimate hunger levels using machine vision and feeding time. Next, a combination of time series data decomposition model and pre-trained deep learning model is used to predict the dissolved oxygen concentration in real time."

To do so, we examined examples ranging from experimental projects that pioneered computational photography in the 1990s, to computer vision techniques, to art projects using generative adversarial neural network models since the 2010s, and analyzed the structural homologies between them from a techno-aesthetic perspective. Art ex machina, machine-made art that generates new images through machine learning based on the quantitative expansion of vast amounts of image data, creates a mechanism with its own life force through new permutations between huge image data. This creative structure is summarized as an autonomous cybernetic, or bio-cybernetic reproduction that is outside the realm of human programming. From this perspective, a meta-image, which is the relationship between image data, is not a simple replication of past data, but a newly created de-bordered image between data and data. As a result, the key to the relationship between bio-cybernetic reproduction and meta-image is that the two concepts are complementary. The bio-cybernetic reproduction mechanism, which can be recognized as a new creative subject and ecosystem, is the evolution of a meta-image from a simple relationship of inanimate individual data."

Based on a deep consideration of the functions and roles of symbols, as studied in psychology, philosophy, religious studies, and theology, this study aims to examine representative theories of Bible didactic that have introduced symbolic action into Christian education. By exploring these theories, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of symbols in Christian education and their impact on the learning process. This study is divided into two main parts. In the first half, it examines the meanings of symbols and their functions as discussed by prominent scholars from various disciplines who have paid attention to symbols, including S. Freud and C. Jung in psychoanalysis, E. Cassirer and P. Ricoeur in philosophy, M. Eliade in religious studies, and P. Tillich in theology. In the second half, the study critically analyzes and discusses representative theories of symbol didactic, such as those proposed by H. Halbfas and P. Biehl, which have applied the symbolic action of neighboring disciplines to Christian education. Symbol didactic differs from traditional biblical didactic, which aims to transmit content, by using symbols as a medium to facilitate dialogue between the learner's experiences and those of the Bible. This approach enables learners to experience the deep relationship between the content of the Bible and the experiences of biblical figures with their own experiences, and provides an opportunity to deepen that experience."

Traditional methods often require destructive sampling, which can damage infrastructure and offer limited insight into the material's internal structure. In contrast, CT scanning provides a non-destructive, highly detailed analysis of asphalt's internal features, such as air voids, aggregate distribution, and binder coverage, all of which are critical to its durability and performance. Additionally, the ability to create 3D models from CT scans allows for deeper insights into factors like void connectivity and aggregate bonding, which directly affect the lifespan of pavements. By combining CT imaging with advanced data processing techniques, such as deep learning, this research offers more accurate and reliable methods for optimizing asphalt mix designs, ultimately leading to longer-lasting roads, reduced maintenance costs, and more sustainable construction practices."

However, these methods have encountered computational efficiency and performance optimization challenges. This paper proposes a new approach using the EfficientNetV2S model to address these issues. The proposed method involves preprocessing handwritten data and applying the EfficientNetV2S model, SAM optimizer, and a learning scheduler to classify gender based on handwriting. In the preprocessing steps, images are converted to grayscale, binarized using Otsu's method to extract word objects, and then normalized to a specified size according to the number of characters. In this study, gender classification accuracy was compared based on character count using a dataset of individuals in their 20s and based on age groups using a dataset of three-character words. The results show that, for the 20s dataset, the highest accuracy of 79.88% was achieved with three-character words. Additionally, in gender classification experiments across age groups from teenagers to 50s, accuracy improved up to the 30s group, reaching 97.29%, but then showed a slight decline in the 40s and 50s groups. The method proposed in this paper shows that gender can be classified with better accuracy than in previous studies and can be used as supplementary data in author attribution analysis."

Therefore, teachers should have a deep understanding of the relationship between triggered curiosity and subsequent exploratory behaviors, but research on this topic is limited. To address this gap, this study selected six 6th-grade students as research participants in this study, and the relationship between their experiences of science curiosity and exploratory behaviors in their daily lives was explored through photojournal entries and interviews. The results of the study showed that the science curiosity experienced by students in their daily lives was categorized into What curiosity, Why curiosity, and How curiosity based on the object of curiosity, and into Contextualized curiosity and Decontextualized curiosity based on the context in which curiosity was triggered. Overall, What curiosity, How curiosity, and Contextualized curiosity were more frequently triggered, and the types of triggered curiosity varied across students, influenced by their personal characteristics and experiences. In addition, students with higher levels of aroused curiosity were more likely to engage in exploratory behaviors. However, when Why curiosity was aroused, they were less likely to engage in exploratory behaviors.

However, if the background and object colors are similar or the background texture is complex, the model's accuracy deteriorates. To solve this problem, a deep learning model based on the region of interest has been developed, but when the background is complex, the image segmentation labeling task can be considered difficult in practice. Additionally, image segmentation maps have the disadvantage of insufficient information because they are expressed as binary values. Therefore, in this study, we would like to present a vision transformer that uses a class activation map instead of an image segmentation map. Through experimental results, the proposed model was able to capture regions of interest well even in images with complex backgrounds and achieved better accuracy than existing classification models for pest and fire blight datasets."

In this study, we use the Image Inpainting techniqueto restore the occluded part of the target on the 2D image, and then restore the occluded part to 3D during the NeRF learningprocess. This resulted in a PSNR performance improvement of about 46% over training the network using the occluded image."

Accordingly, many studies are using hardware accelerators for quick and accurate calculations. However, the performance bottleneck is due to data movement between the hardware accelerators and the CPU. In this paper, we propose a data prefetch strategy that can efficiently reduce such operational bottlenecks. The core idea of the data prefetch strategy is to predict the data needed for the next task and upload it to local memory while the hardware accelerator (Matrix Multiplication Unit, MMU) performs a task. This strategy can be enhanced by using a dual buffer to perform read and write operations simultaneously. This reduces latency and execution time of data transfer. Through simulations, we demonstrate a 24% improvement in the performance of hardware accelerators by maximizing parallel processing with dual buffers and bottlenecks between memories with data prefetch."

Amidst this shift, various online shopping platforms are adopting automation strategies in their purchasing processes to secure customer loyalty. Particularly, with the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, innovative automatic purchasing services like Amazon Dash Smart Shelf are gaining attention. However, current research predominantly focuses on the efficiency of automation, with a lack of in-depth studies on user experience and service design. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting research where users directly experience and evaluate automated purchasing services.Methods: This exploratory research on IoT-enabled automated purchasing services is divided into two studies. The first study involved a deep analysis of existing e-commerce users’ purchasing experiences, assessing their perception and need for automated services. This was achieved using the FCB Grid measurement method and in-depth interviews. Based on this, the research team developed a minimum viable product (MVP) that allowed users to experience fully automated purchasing. The second study involved users actually experiencing the automated purchasing service, with their experiences evaluated through diary studies, surveys, and interviews.Results: In the first study, in-depth interviews and involvement assessments were conducted with 14 participants from 1-3 person households. Participants identified repetitive purchasing, inventory management difficulties, and the inconvenience of using various purchasing outlets as major issues with existing services. The involvement assessment revealed that the most suitable product group for automation was rational and low-involvement products. In the second study, another set of 10 participants experienced the automated purchasing service for six weeks, documenting and evaluating their experiences through diary studies. This process highlighted the participants’ system requirements and the need for personalized services, which significantly contributed to the formation of service design guidelines. These guidelines, based on insights from the participants’ experiences, suggest directions for the development of hardware, software, and overall service. Finally, the service received high scores in terms of ease of learning, satisfaction, usefulness, and ease of use, as confirmed by the USE (Usability, Satisfaction, and Ease of use) evaluation survey.Conclusions: This study analyzes users’ expectations and needs for IoT-based automated purchasing services from the perspective of involvement and explores the potential of the service through long-term actual use experiences. The research provides directions for the development of fully automated purchasing services, contributing significantly to future research and service development."

We constructed a dataset with simultaneously measured axial and radial acceleration signals during bearing operation. Simple signal analysis showed that two different signals are physically very similar, confirming that differences in training and validation performance due to changing measurement directions indicate overfitting.

Therefore, while research on haze removal algorithms using machine learning and deep learning techniques is actively conducted, obtaining a sufficient amount of data sets for training realistically is challenging. For this purpose, this paper proposes methods of generating haze synthetic images using random noise with Gaussian distribution or Standard uniform distribution. When the haze distribution is uniformly spread overall, haze is generated by creating random noise, followed by normalization and low-pass filtering. When the haze distribution is localized, haze is generated using filtering in frequency domain and low-pass filtering in the spatial domain. The proposed methods allow users to select the desired haze distribution and generate haze synthetic images with the desired density using simple formulas. Additionally, experiments have shown that when using Gaussian distribution, denser haze generation is possible compared to standard uniform distribution."

In such environments, handling users' diverse data requires an efficient network configuration of data centers composed of numerous servers, rather than a single server. However, traditional network methods are vendor-dependent, managing each server individually, which increases the management overhead for data center servers. To address this efficiently, SDN technology has gained attention, emphasizing the importance of load balancing techniques for handling data requests across servers. This paper proposes a load balancing technique that addresses these delay issues by monitoring server load levels and redirecting data processing to other servers with relatively lower loads when a server reaches a certain threshold, thereby enhancing the availability of all servers. Specifically, by automatically calculating and dynamically applying thresholds based on the average load of all servers, the proposed method aims to achieve optimal load balancing for the current network traffic. Through the experiment, it was confirmed that the server's load rate did not exceed the threshold and become overloaded. In the case of the comparison method, with a fixed threshold, one server's load rate increased to 96.39% when a large number of packets were received. However, with the proposed method, all servers recorded a load rate of below 90%. This demonstrates that optimal load balancing is achieved without the administrator needing to find the optimal threshold."

Although volumetric assessment using imaging contributes to surgical simulation by estimating the function of future liver remnants in predicting PHLF, liver function is assumed to be homogeneous throughout the liver. The combination of volumetric and functional analyses may be more useful for an accurate evaluation of liver function and prediction of PHLF than only volumetric analysis. Gadoxetic acid is a hepatocyte-specific magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent that is taken up by hepatocytes via the OATP1 transporter after intravenous administration. Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging (MRI) offers information regarding both global and regional functions, leading to a more precise evaluation even in cases with heterogeneous liver function.

This data served as a crucial foundation for forest restoration and management at that time. In the 1990s, Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) were used to survey forest resources across North Korea, revealing for the first time the extent of forest degradation. Since then, satellite imagery has been regularly used to monitor North Korean forests, a practice that continues to this day. Since the 2000s, high-resolution satellite imagery from the Korean Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT) series and Satellite pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT), along with Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology, has enabled precise analysis of forest resources. Furthermore, digital twin technology has been applied to simulate forest resource information in 3D, enabling more accurate management. Recently, deep learning and other artificial intelligence technologies have been combined with research on forest resources, forest disasters, and forest ecosystem monitoring. A significant research focus has been on creating a carbon map that spatiotemporally assesses the absorption and emission of carbon dioxide in forests. Monitoring North Korean forests also remains a critical source of data for establishing inter-Korean forest cooperation policies. The necessity of Forest Analysis Ready Data (F-ARD) has also increased. F-ARD simplifies complex preprocessing, enhancing the utility of forest remote sensing data. The F-ARD produced by the Compact Advanced Satellite 500-4 (CAS500-4, Agricultural and Forestry Satellite) will serve as a new tool for forest analysis by providing geometrically and atmospherically corrected high-resolution satellite imagery with gap-filling capabilities.

In particular, this study was designed to provide in-depth education by organically linking the content elements of knowledge and understanding, process and function, and value and attitude in the 2022 revised curriculum, ‘Teaching and Learning in School Curriculum Design and Operation.’ In the first stage (emotion), the class was developed as a student- participatory class, which provided students with a deep experience related to life. In the second stage (cognitive) area, the procedural knowledge of process and function enhanced cooperation and creative problem-solving skills, and in the third stage (behavioral) area, the ability to practice social justice linked to life was demonstrated by internalizing it in terms of values and attitudes."

Thus, efforts continue to secure its position as an independent foreign second language. Against this backdrop, this study examined the perspectives of university professors in Japan-related departments on collaborative education between high schools and universities. A survey was conducted with 48 professors from Japan-related departments in four-year universities nationwide. The results revealed that interest in changes to the secondary education curriculum and the recovery of Japanese language status was not necessarily high. Additionally, many professors expressed the need for collaboration between secondary and higher education as well as cooperation among local communities, high schools, and universities. They also showed interest in the universities’ role in addressing the declining academic levels of incoming students and enhancing their capabilities. Furthermore, some professors emphasized the importance of deep learning focused on strengthening the abilities of Japanese majors, expanding practical education programs, and developing career and employment programs aimed at improving professional skills, rather than focusing solely on collaborative education between high schools and universities."

At the time of the invention of photography and cinema, the field of 'automatic creation' was established for them in comparison to traditional art genres such as painting. Recently, as AI has been applied to video production, the concept of 'automatic creation' has been expanded, and experimental creations that freely cross the boundaries of literature, art, photography, and film are active.  By utilizing technologies such as machine learning and deep learning, AI automated creation allows AI to perform the creative process independently. Automated creation using AI can greatly improve efficiency, but it also risks compromising the personal and subjective nature of art. The problem stems from the fact that AI cannot completely replace human creativity."
Adaptive Classification of VPN and Non-VPN IoT Traffic Data Using CNN with Spatio-temporal Features,2024,"['Internet of Things', 'Adaptive Classification', 'Convolutional Neural Network', 'Virtual Private Network', 'Spatial and Temporal Features']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Low network throughput and high round-trip latency are two common challenges in Internet of Things (IoT) communications. This study addresses these issues by proposing an adaptive classification method that maintains network throughput above 360 Mbps and round-trip latency below 1 ms, while achieving a classification accuracy of 90% and a recall rate above 93.33%. This demonstrates the method’s ability to provide high throughput, low latency, and efficient traffic classification, addressing critical performance challenges in IoT environments and offering robust support for traffic management and security in real-world IoT deployments. The proposed method utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate between virtual private network (VPN) and non-VPN traffic. First, the communication traffic data are cleaned using an amplitude-limiting filtering technique to remove noise. The cleaned data are then divided into subsets for preprocessing. Next, a deep learning model is trained using the ISCX VPN–nonVPN public dataset, which integrates both spatial and temporal features of traffic data. Finally, the model leverages the parameter-sharing capability of neurons in the CNN’s hidden layers, reducing the number of trained parameters and significantly improving classification performance. Considering the development of new technologies such as VPN intelligent deployment and IPsec policy automatic generation, the research results of this study will accelerate the automation and intelligence transformation of the IoT ecosystem from deployment to management."
How Do Fluctuations in Raw Material Prices Affect the Restaurant Industry? Can This Be Predicted Using AI Models?: Focusing on the Dining-out Price of Samgyeopsal,2024,"['물가', '인공지능', '가격 예측', '가격 예측 모델', 'LSTM', 'Livestock Products', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Price Prediction', 'Price Prediction Model', 'LSTM']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Despite the stabilization of the price index following the resolution of supply chain issues caused by Covid-19, consumers still perceive prices to be very high. The rise in dining-out prices, in particular, imposes a significant burden on the national economy. So, how much is the actual rise in food ingredient prices affecting the restaurant industry? And is the current price increase really reasonable? Additionally, if we can predict changes in dining prices through raw material costs, wouldn't consumers be able to make more informed decisions, and could this serve as a pricing indicator in the domestic restaurant industry? In this study, we adopt the aforementioned questions as our main research questions (RQs) and analyze how fluctuations in livestock prices impact the restaurant industry, focusing on dining prices. Additionally, we will develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these changes. Specifically, the study will identify and analyze factors in the distribution process that are expected to affect dining-out prices. Based on these results, it will ultimately analyze and predict dining-out prices. At this stage, fluctuations in livestock and dining-out prices will be analyzed separately for the Covid-19 period and the post-Covid-19 period. For this study, we have selected han-don (Korean pork), which is the most familiar food to our citizens, and specifically, we will use the dining-out price of the representative cut, samgyeopsal (pork belly). Specifically, the study will analyze the relationships between these variables and implement prediction models using techniques such as correlation analysis, OLS linear regression, ARIMA, and VAR, which are commonly used in time series data analysis. Additionally, deep learning prediction models will be developed using LSTM and GRU models. The study clarifies the relationship between the farm gate price of han-don (Korean pork) and the dining-out price of samgyeopsal (pork belly), and provides a clear analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on dining-out prices. Additionally, it implements significant prediction models. In conclusion, the models proposed in this study will enable small business owners to determine reasonable pricing points when making pricing decisions, and consumers can make informed purchases based on these decisions. Additionally, the government and public institutions can respond at a national level to price changes caused by trends and volatility in the prices of livestock raw materials. Ultimately, it is expected that utilizing this model can contribute to stabilizing the domestic restaurant industry and the national economy."

It is now time to consider how to coexist with AI in the realm of religion and ministry. This paper explores the challenges and issues that artificial intelligenceparticularly machine learning and deep learning applied to big dataposes to pastoral care and counseling. The researcher adopted a literature review methodology to analyze and review relevant studies for this research. Artificial intelligence is an engineering technology modeled after human brain neural networks and designed to perform information processing and intelligence roles similar to humans. The development of AI is closely related to the field of psychological counseling, and recently, it has been actively applied in psychological care and mental health, which involves managing human cognition, emotion, and behavior. When AI is used in pastoral care and counseling, its convenience and accessibility are valuable, offering advantages such as improving the training of pastoral counselors and increasing psychotherapeutic efficiency. However, there is also a risk that AI may limit the therapeutic relationship with the client, hinder the experience of God's presence, generate false information, raise human rights issues due to algorithmic bias, and raise ethical issues surrounding privacy and personal information. The use of AI in pastoral care and counseling raises critical questions: Can pastoral care ministries of healing, supporting, guiding, and reconciliation be effectively conducted using AI? Is pastoral counseling with spiritual discernment still possible?  The Korean church and the broader Christian community that practices Christian counseling urgently need to establish ethical guidelines and develop educational programs for the era of AI. They also need to cultivate professional pastoral counselors who are trained in Christian spirituality and scientific and technological approaches to AI."

Those two pieces are ‘Jeongamdoinsigweonseo’ and ‘Jeongamdoinsiljeokchanbyeongin’.These two works were written when Kim Si-seup traveled to Seoul in the spring of 1471 and met Haemin, who was the chief monk at Jeongeupwon at the time. Haemin requested Kim Si-seup to write them. ‘Jeongamdoinsigweonseo’ is the preface to Jeongamdoinsigweon, and ‘Jeongamdoinsiljeokchanbyeongin’ consists of the praise (‘chan’) and postscript ('in') of Jeongamdoinsiljeok.‘Jeongamdoinsiljeokchanbyeongin’ refers to ‘Jeongamdoin’ whose Dharma name was Myobeop, courtesy name was Jeongam, and family name was Gu. His lifetime spanned from 1374 to 1449. In his life, he preached for the deceased King Taejong, led Lady Yi-bi Kwon to become a Buddhist nun, and composed Buddhist poetry while touring Mount Geumgang.In ‘Jeongamdoinsigweonseo', ‘Jeongamdoin' refers to Haemin. It was previously known through the records of the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty that Haemin served as the chief monk of Jeongeupwon around 1463 and died around 1473. The recent study of ‘Jeongamdoinsigweonseo' has revealed new facts about him. Haemin, whose courtesy name is Jeongam, belonged to the Yi clan of Taean. He learned Buddhism at the age of 13 from the aforementioned Gu clan, and in 1457, by the order of King Sejo, he became the first chief monk of the restored Jeongeupwon. After that, he received great respect as a renowned possessor of Buddhist teachings from royal family members including King Sejo and Queen Jeonghui. Jeongamdoinsigwon and Jeongamdoinsiljeok are works that can be attributed to the authorship of Haemin and Gu, respectively. From such cases, it is evident that nuns, like monks, engaged in compiling writings when they possessed high levels of scholarship and deep commitment to practice.Information on nuns from the early Joseon Dynasty and the chief monk of Jeongeupwon is almost entirely derived from the Annals and is mostly fragmentary. In this context, the two aforementioned texts left by Kim Si-seup could contribute significantly to a more in-depth understanding of the lives of early Joseon nuns and the status of the Jeongeupwon chief monk. For further discussion, the original manuscript facsimiles, modern typographic editions, and Korean translations of the two texts have been included in the appendix."

The meeting was the naming ceremony of AI and the launch of a new discipline. Leading the meeting were John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky.Along with Herbert Simon and Alan Newell, the Dartmouth Four have been hailed as the founders and pioneers of AI. But the researchers behind the success of neural network-based AI, and more notably deep learning, probably disagree with this interpretation. The groundwork of the new AI, represented by neural networks, robotics, and artificial life, was laid by cybernetics in the 1940s. Launched in 1956, AI focused on simulating human intelligence with digital computers, among the many prospects of machine intelligence presented by cybernetics.Early AI, now called GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI), rejected the tradition of cybernetics while establishing its institutional foundations and persecuting neural networks and artificial brains. This paper draws attention to the history of the time when AI was born in 1956, examines what happened on the path from cybernetics to AI, and why the pioneers of AI tried to distinguish themselves from cybernetics and sever its academic connection."

In particular, sensory experiences that involve physical action can have a significant impact on children's creative development and spatial cognition. In order to stimulate children's emotional resonance, and promote children's cognitive development to obtain a better space experience, the design of sensory experience space for children must be reflected as a key factor in promoting children's healthy growth and development including design-thinking abilities and critical problem-solving skills.  Therefore, this article studies the children's exhibition space through the review of precedent children's development theories  and domestic cases.  On this basis, the physiological, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics of children in the exhibition space are deeply studied.  Then, this study proposes a sensory experience space that is optimized for children’s physical and cognitive growth. (Method) First, this study analyzes the previous theoretical research results in the field of children's cognitive development, which systematically explains the process, characteristics, and spatial behavior patterns of children's cognitive development at different ages. Based on these theoretical foundations, we further identify design elements that guide and enrich children's sensory experience. Using the derived elements of sensory experience spaces as a framework for analysis, three existing exhibition spaces for children were analyzed. Through case studies, it was possible to discover the spatial elements, design composition, and improvement points required for dedicated exhibition spaces. (Results) By utilizing the three design elements (physical movement, cognitive thinking, and experiential behavior), the design can be driven to optimize children's sensory experience. In particular, to maximize the sensory experience, light, color, sound, materials, and objects were introduced into each space to stimulate cognitive development and behavior. Specifically, the reasonable use of light and color can adjust the space atmosphere and stimulate children's visual perception and emotional response. Sound design can add fun and encourage children to participate actively. The choice of materials and objects is directly related to children's physical movement and tactile experience, which promotes the deep integration of perception and cognition. (Conclusions) These sensory experience spaces for children will effectively meet their multisensory needs and stimulate their curiosity and desire to explore, which will help trigger not only physical development but also cognitive and psychological development. This proposal for a sensory experience space centered on children's spatial cognitive development may be significant in providing a basis for the design of children's experiential education space."

SR-IOV is a virtualization support function that takes direct access to PCI devices, thusgiving a high I/O performance by minimizing the need for hypervisor or operating system interventions. With SR-IOV, network I/Oacceleration can be realized in virtualization systems that have relatively long I/O paths compared to bare-metal systems and frequentcontext switches between the user area and kernel area. To take performance advantages of SR-IOV, network resource management policiesthat can derive optimal network performance when SR-IOV is applied to an instance such as a virtual machine(VM) or container arebeing actively studied.This paper evaluates and analyzes the network performance of SR-IOV implementing I/O acceleration is comparedwith Virtio in terms of 1) network delay, 2) network throughput, 3) network fairness, 4) performance interference, and 5) multi-network.The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, the network I/O process of Virtio and SR-IOV was clearly explained in the virtualizationsystem, and second, the evaluation results of the network performance of Virtio and SR-IOV were analyzed based on various performancemetrics. Third, the system overhead and the possibility of optimization for the SR-IOV network in a virtualization system with high VMdensity were experimentally confirmed. The experimental results and analysis of the paper are expected to be referenced in the networkresource management policy for virtualization systems that operate network-intensive services such as smart factories, connected cars,deep learning inference models, and crowdsourcing."

With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, deepfake technology has become more sophisticated, leading to an increase in crimes involving its use. Consequently, cases of defamation caused by deepfake pornography are also on the rise. However, public awareness of such acts as crimes and recognition of the irreparable harm they cause to victims have not kept pace with the evolving reality.There are no specific provisions regarding the requirements for the establishment of defamation in civil law. However, if the perpetrator's actions, such as creating or distributing deepfake pornography, are deemed an unlawful act that damages the victim's reputation, the victim may claim damages. The court may also take appropriate measures to restore the victim's reputation. Furthermore, the victim may request the deletion of the content or an injunction against its further distribution in addition to claiming damages.Deepfake technology is being used positively in various fields. In entertainment, it is applied for face de-aging, voice de-aging, and dubbing technologies. In education, it brings historical figures back to life, enabling interactive experiences for learners. In healthcare, it aids in the early diagnosis and treatment of diseases and surgeries.However, the misuse of this technology has led to a surge in crimes involving the creation of deepfake pornography. Due to the nature of deepfake technology, it is challenging to identify the responsible parties, and its decision-making processes often lack transparency. The rapid spread of content online, along with the use of overseas servers, further complicates legal regulation. As a result, the current legal framework has limitations in fully addressing defamation caused by deepfake pornography.To prevent the misuse of deepfake technology, comprehensive measures are needed across legal, technical, and societal dimensions. Regulations on deepfake pornography should be consolidated into a single law, and an independent oversight body should be established. Clear sanction measures against creators and distributors of deepfake pornography must also be defined, along with provisions for victim compensation.As deepfake technology continues to advance, its potential for misuse is likely to increase, posing severe threats to individuals' reputations. Once a reputation is tarnished, the damage can be nearly impossible to undo. Therefore, addressing defamation issues caused by deepfake pornography requires ongoing research and in-depth discussions."

By applying a text-based approach to evolving IPA research, this exploratory study assessed the concrete satisfaction and dissatisfaction elements felt by tourists. The study limited its scope to 15 Incheon attractions and analyzed 114,007 sentences from Naver blogs written by tourists. Satisfaction levels were derived through deep learning sentiment analysis of the text, while the importance of each attraction was determined by the TF-IDF(term frequency-inverse document frequency) ratio of the attraction names in the text categorized by attributes such as attraction, transportation, activities, and food/drink. Key positive and negative keywords and sentences were extracted using the TextRank algorithm, focusing on attractions in the maintenance and improvementneeded areas. The findings reveal that experiential elements of attractions act as differentiating factors, while their absence can provoke negative reactions from tourists. Moreover, content reflecting local culture and history, the development of family-friendly experiential attractions, parking space expansion, and food service improvements emerged as crucial elements for attraction development."

To this end, a control system is being introduced that automatically measures the number of captured pests using digital traps, breaking away from the conventional method of visual measurement by skilled farmers. However, the accuracy of pest counting is decreasing due to the problem of occlusion of captured pests. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a pest counting model consisting of a stacked density map-based counter and a kernel generator. In particular, we would like to propose a deep learning architecture that estimates spatially variable kernels for converting a dot map to a density map through a kernel generator and generates an adaptive density map from a counter. Through experimental results, the proposed stack structure-based kernel and density map generation model was effective even in pest images with occlusions and was able to improve accuracy by about 26% in mean absolute error compared to the existing pest counting model."

However, it often results in awkward images due to differences in brightness and color tones between the background and foreground. Image harmonization techniques aim to reduce this incongruity and have gained significant attention in the field of image editing. These techniques allow for realistic matching of color tones between the foreground and background. Existing deep learning models for image harmonization have shown promise in achieving harmonization performance through the use of large-scale training datasets. However, these models tend to exhibit poor generalization performance when the loss function does not effectively consider brightness or when the dataset has a biased brightness distribution. To address these issues, we propose an image harmonization scheme that is robust to variations in brightness. This scheme incorporates an LAB color space-based loss function, which explicitly calculates the brightness of a given image, and an LAB color space-based preprocessing  scheme to create a dataset with a balanced brightness distribution. Experimental results on public image datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits robust harmonization performance under various brightness conditions."

The act of worship not only holds educational effects in itself, but also the practice of liturgy and rituals inculcates faith within individuals and communities. Through Christian Education, believers learn the core truths of Christianity and experience the maturation of their faith, thereby becoming better worshippers for subsequent gatherings. Since the 1960s, John Westerhoff, recognizing this mechanism, has advocated for the formation and transmission of faith through community participation and the practice of liturgy and rituals. Liturgical theologians like Byron Anderson and Louis Weil have also pursued the integration of liturgical studies and Christian education, emphasizing the formative power of liturgical practice. This study will demonstrate that the practice of liturgy and rituals not only enhances learning and understanding but also greatly benefits the formation of individual and communal memory and identity. I will particularly show the deep educational significance inherent in these practices. By doing so, I will show unfamiliar terms in Protestant traditions, such as liturgy and rituals that not only shape the believer’s faith but also facilitate natural faith transmission to the next generation. In this article, I will insist scholars researching worship must possess educational literacy, and those specializing in Christian education must recognize that when they have a theological and practical understanding of liturgy, they can foster true worshippers."

CNN은 딥러닝 분야에서 이미지 분류 및 데이터 학습에 유용한 장점을 가지고 있다. 이 기법을 활용하여 UV LAMP로 특정 시간 동안 HDPE를 자외선에 노출시킨후, 부식된 이미지 데이터를 취득하고 훈련을 진행하였고 90% 이상의 정확도를 도출하였다. 연구 결과를 기반으로 선박 소재의 노후화를 예측하고, 이에 따른 폐선 처리 문제와 해상 환경오염을 사전에 방지할 수 있는 효과적인 방안을 모색할 수 있을 것으로 기대된다.","Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) materials, which are mainly used in ship manufacturing, provide excellent durability and impact resistance, but long-term exposure to ultraviolet rays causes serious deformation, which complicates the processing of closed wires and is pointed out as one of the main causes of marine environmental pollution. As a countermeasure against this, the use of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which is attracting attention as an eco-friendly and recyclable material, is increasing, but HDPE is also showing vulnerability to ultraviolet rays due to the limitations of heat resistance and weather resistance. In this paper, we apply the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an artificial intelligence technique, to analyze and predict HDPE corroded by exposure to ultraviolet rays over time. CNN has useful advantages for image classification and data learning in the field of deep learning, and through this technique, it was confirmed that after exposing HDPE to ultraviolet rays for a specific time using UV LAMP, it can be predicted with more than 90% accuracy by acquiring it with corroded image data and conducting training. Based on the research results, it is expected that it will be possible to predict the aging of ship materials and find effective ways to prevent the disposal of abandoned ships and marine environmental pollution in advance."

The results confirmed that incorporating creative experiential activities into the school curriculum was more meaningful than simply adding new activities. This requires deep reflection on the content and methods of education, and the overall values that school education should pursue. The curricular characteristics of the creative experiential activities confirmed in this study are as follows: First, creative experiential activities break away from existing subject-centered school education by including activities closely related to students' lives in the official curriculum. Second, they expand the depth and breadth of learning by building complementary relationships with subjects, while simultaneously increasing the flexibility and comprehensiveness of the curriculum. Third, they emphasize the subjectivity and creativity of the educational stakeholders by creating a curriculum that teachers and students develop together. This approach helps select educational content that reflects students' needs and interests, maximizing the meaning and value of learning through the curriculum. These characteristics suggest that creative experiential activities are vital educational assets that support students' holistic growth beyond simple extracurricular activities and play a complementary role in the curriculum."

However, frequent accidents occur due to deviation in construction design planned by inaccurate location information of underground structure. Meanwhile, the electrical resistivity survey, knowns as non-destructive method, is based on the difference in the electric potential of electrodes to measure the electrical resistance of ground. This method is significantly advanced with multi-electrode and deep learning for analyzing strata. However, there is no study to quantitatively assess change in electrical resistance according to geometric conditions of structures. This study evaluates changes in electrical resistance through geometric parameters of electrodes and structure. Firstly, electrical resistance numerical module is developed using generalized mesh occurring minimal errorsbetween theoretical and numerical resistance values. Then, changes in resistances are quantitatively compared on geometric parameters including burial depth, diameter of structure, and distance electrode and structure under steady current condition. The results show that higher electrical resistance is measured for shallow depth, larger size, and proximity to the electrode. Additionally, electric potential and current density distributions are analyzed to discuss the measured electrical resistance around the terminal electrode and structure."

The reality is that writing through ChatGTP is quite common in all areas of literature. Oh Jang-hwan, who started his career during the colony of Japanese Imperialism era in the 1930s, was a poet who revolutionized the city center in the form of prose poetry. While artificial intelligence in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution was a revolution in the future society, Oh Jang-hwan's prose poetry was a revolution in a closed society during the Japanese colonial era. Oh Jang-hwan's poetic world was the face of the real world through prose poetry. It recognizes reality through criticism, self-denial, and self-criticism from tradition and decadent civilized society. The reality faced by poet Oh Jang-hwan reinforces his poetic imagery through constant participation in reality. In the 4th Industrial Revolution, artificial intelligence becomes the subject of creation and becomes a model in all areas of literature. This is an innovation and revolution of the future society. If the high-level emotions that only humans feel are utilized by using artificial neural networks in deep learning, the reading of emotions that people want to express will be more concrete. In each era, it has come so far through a revolution led by the times. This is seen as the result of a sense of criticism that reflects reality. In this sense, it can be said that poet Oh Jang-hwan has secured poetic reality more than any other poet of the time by showing vitality for the future rather than being complacent with reality."

This paper aims to address this issue by developing a deep learning model that classifies various clothing items and their colors within a single image using buyer review images. After directly crawling buyer review image data and performing various preprocessing steps such as data augmentation, we utilized the YOLOv10 model to detect clothing objects and classify them into categories. Subsequently, to improve color extraction, we implemented a cropping method to isolate clothing regions in the images and calculated the similarity with a color chart to extract the most similar color names. Our experimental results show that our approach is effective, with performance increasing with model size and augmentation scale. The employed model showed stable performance in both clothing category and color extraction, proving its reliability. The proposed system not only enhances customer satisfaction and purchasing power by accurately classifying clothing categories and colors based on user review images but also lays the foundation for further research in automated fashion analysis. Moreover, it possesses the scalability to be utilized in various fields of the related industry, such as fashion trend analysis, inventory management, and marketing strategy development."

In order to apply such a scientific analysis technique, the quality and quantity of data are essential. Still, when the amount of data is insufficient, it is challenging to apply it to the scientific method. For example, data such as the macroeconomy are often set to have a relatively long period of data disclosure, or because the assets of real estate-related indicators among assets are very non-floating, the presentation period is often long. Therefore, in order to overcome the limitations of this data shortage, this study intends to study how to expand the existing time series through the TimeGAN model. A total of 50 time series related to economic indicators were collected on a monthly basis from 2013 to 2022, according to the data set, and a total of ten final time series were selected through the correlation between time series. As a result of expanding ten time series through the TimeGAN model, the similarity between the statistical distribution of the actual and extended data was proved based on the PCA and t-SNE visualization algorithms. Through this study, the possibility of overcoming various potential limitations arising from narrow data could be confirmed. Therefore, it is expected that this paper will be a positive reference in various future studies to overcome shortcomings such as data underfitting."

The load tests are widely used to assess the serviceability and safety condition of bridges that are continually exposed to various forms of repeated loading. Recently, advancement in smart diagnostic technologies have introduced methods for assessing structural responses using image data. However, when utilizing image data, challenges such as distortions from lighting and angles, as well as difficulties in collecting information from blind spots, can hinder the comprehensive understanding of structural behavior. To address these limitations, this study presents an artificial intelligence (AI) based method for estimating vertical deflections using strain data measured during static tests on girders. The strain data were obtained from load tests conducted on 11 girders at the Hybrid Structural Testing Center of Myongji University. The deep learning model was developed using a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, with multiple input parameters including girder type, static load, and strain data. The performance of AI model was further enhanced through hyperparameter optimization, and its accuracy was verified through consistency evaluation. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated by analyzing prediction accuracy and computational time in relation to the quantity of training data."
A Study on LSTM-Based Lithium Battery SoH Estimation in Urban Railway Vehicle Operating Environments,2024,['Lithium polymer battery · State of health (SoH) · Long short-term memory (LSTM) · Urban railway vehicle'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper presents the composition of a lithium polymer battery and a battery management system used in the confi guration of 10-car urban railway vehicles on Seoul Line 4 in the Republic of Korea. The operating environment and load usage conditions are analyzed. The initial capacity was measured through full charge/full discharge experiments, and the battery capacity after the experiment was measured and used as training data. During railway vehicle operation, the battery load characteristic is that power is supplied through the charger, except in certain sections. Battery usage is extremely short compared to the operating time, and fl oating charging is constantly performed through the charger. Under these conditions, a battery aging experiment was conducted over 500 cycles. To minimize the impact of aging due to capacity measurements, the battery’s capacity was measured every 100 cycles. The experiments were performed at room temperature to replicate conditions similar to those of actual vehicles. The acquired data were preprocessed to enhance the accuracy of state of health (SoH) estimation. The SoH of the battery was then estimated using a long short-term memory model, which is a type of deep learning recurrent neural network."

Fake news is viewed as a digital organism that feeds on human interest and emotions, and how the Generative AI can increase the production and propagation power of fake news is considered. Through literature review and case analysis, the main characteristics of the Generative AI that can be abused in the production of fake news were derived. Deep learning, natural language processing, and multi-modal content synthesis are representative. Based on this, a conceptual model was proposed to explain the life cycle of AI-generated fake news and the factors of propagation within the digital platform. The research results suggest that the Generative AI can greatly amplify the scale and persuasiveness of fake news by automatically producing realistic and emotionally stimulating content. It also highlights the importance of digital platforms and user actions in the spread of AI-generated fake news.

Jongmyo-Jeryeak education should target students in the 5th and 6th grades of elementary school and the 1st to 3rd grades of middle school. In the appreciation area, education should not only focus on the musical composition of Jongmyo-Jeryeak but also study its social and cultural background, enabling students to understand its significance in modern Korean and global contexts. In the performance area, students should learn music, singing, and dance separately and then be educated in ‘harmony,’ where the three types of arts are integrated through role division. Lastly, in the creation area, it is essential to enhance the understanding of traditional notation systems and produce individual musical outputs. This paper proposes rewriting the lyrics of the Jongmyo Jeryeak as an advanced activity. By focusing on the purpose and significance of Jongmyo-Jeryeak, students will create lyrics that praise the achievements of past kings and sing them to the music. Through these activities, students can gain a deep understanding of Jongmyo-Jeryeak and engage in lively discussions.

To mitigate the issue, we introduce a BP nerve small target segmentation network by incorporating BP object detection and U-Net based semantic segmentation into a single deep learning framework based on the multi-scale approach. To this end, the current BP detection and identification was estimated: 1) A RetinaNet model was used to roughly locate the BP nerve region using multi-scale based feature representations, and 2) U-Net was then used by feeding plural BP nerve features for each scale. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model produces high quality BP segmentation by increasing the accuracies of the BP nerve identification with the assistance of roughly locating the BP nerve area compared to competing methods such as segmentation-only models."

Accordingly, the direction of urban regeneration projects must also seek ways to change according to changes in the social structure. This is a matter of justification for applying changes in economic activities and consumption patterns according to population changes and environment in the country and region. Measures to strengthen urban and regional competitiveness should promote regional revitalization through restoration of spatial characteristics. The new measures must meet the basic meaning and purpose of urban regeneration for regional reinvention and revitalization. Social values continue to be discussed on various concepts of openness and democracy, social quality, equity, and sustainability. Looking at the bills related to social values, the Social Value Act (draft) is still pending in the National Assembly. However, the ESG 4 Act, the Public Institution Operation Act, the National Finance Act, the National Pension Act, and the Procurement Business Act, are all in effect as of January 2024. The common social items of the 'ESG 4 Act' are the pursuit of equality and diversity. The characteristics of social values are summarized as publicity, liquidity, consultation, and diversity. Discussion of the concept of social value in Korea began with the promise of state administration when the Moon Jae In government was inaugurated, focusing on 'improving the quality of life of the people'. Currently, various methods of measuring social values are being discussed, but problems of standardization, and flexibility requirements for measuring social values are exposed. Therefore, the development of a new value measurement methodology through artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning is being prepared. In urban regeneration, social value practice is practiced through social inclusion and urban regeneration projects applying social values. In urban regeneration, the subjects of social value practice are local people, who are social capital, and the stakeholders of the target site. The practice of social value is expressed by the participation of the social capital, which is the resident of the target site. For social capital, the scale of the network and the measure of trust are important. In Korea, it is proposed to newly discuss ways to practice social values using collective impact. Collective impact is a method of solving common problems through joint goal building, collaboration, and solidarity. This will be an alternative methodology for realizing social value practice in urban regeneration based on a shared system, reinforced complementary activities, and continuous communication."

As attention is drawn to these external distractions, it becomes challenging to listen to one's inner voice, leading to a sense of losing oneself. To rediscover oneself, a period of silence, where one concentrates deep into their inner being, is essential. Silence can be categorized into externally imposed silence and voluntary, chosen silence. Historically, women have been forced to keep in silence, with figures such as Catherine of Siena in the 14th century and Teresa of Avila in the 16th century also being compelled to remain silent by the Church. However, these women did not merely endure this imposed silence but instead engaged in voluntary and chosen practices of silence, such as prayer, meditation, and contemplation. Through these practices, they gained unique theological insights, transcended traditional theological boundaries, and voiced their creative and transformative ideas. For women to overcome imposed silence and find their true voice, paradoxically, the practice of voluntary and chosen silence is necessary. The silent practices of Catherine and Teresa serve as valuable guides for the spiritual lives of modern women. Like them, one can experience deep communion with God in silence, focus on inner voices to expand self-knowledge, practice empathetic listening for others, critically reflect on the world's issues, and learn to coexist with the wisdom of nature. For spiritual maturity, it is important to draw wisdom from the lives and teachings of spiritual foremothers and to create and practice moments and spaces of silence in one's own unique way."

Specifically, we reveal the structure of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), trace its technical improvement process in detail, and classify the types of subsequent models developed later. The tasks performed by GAN’s successor models are diverse. GAN is steadily evolving, completing amazing tasks that were impossible with existing generative models, such as high-resolution image generation, image substitution such as drawings and photos, and face synthesis. The principles of GAN are, first, data learning through adversarial competition between generator and discriminator, second, calculation of accurate probability distribution through Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and third, calculation of fine features of images through deep convolution structure. The most important characteristic of GAN as a generative model is its ability to create realistic images similar to photographs.

The research team utilized deep learning technology to accurately identify bibliographic information and collect 743 episodes of the series. Subsequently, based on the series’ creative methods and narrative structure, we analyzed the zeitgeist and cultural landscape of colonial Korea as reflected in specific episodes.We first explored how major historical events and institutional/social changes of the tumultuous 1920s were reflected in Meongteong’s daily life, analyzing the multifaceted clash between modern and traditional cultures. Next, we highlighted various episodes that showcase “Meongteongguri’s” unique commentary on the political realities of colonial rule, uncovering critical messages about imperialism and oppressive state power embedded in what has often been regarded primarily as entertainment comics. Lastly, by examining the new concepts of romance and modern family depicted in the series within their historical context, we investigated the changing family relationships and patriarchal structures of the time.In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the four-panel comic “Meongteongguri” is not merely a form of entertainment but a significant cultural-historical document that vividly captures the changes, conflicts, and colonial realities of contemporary Korean society. This research provides a foundation for a more nuanced understanding of the complex aspects of Korean popular culture during the Japanese colonial period and its historical context, while also underscoring the need for in-depth follow-up studies on the significance of “Meongteongguri” in the history of comics, culture, and journalism."

This process has consistently raised concerns regarding time costs and the risk of incidents. To address these issues, simulations of heavy equipment are conducted using Speedgoat and the Simulink API. However, due to the varying compatibility of different versions of Speedgoat hardware and Simulink API, engineers need to have a comprehensive understanding of various Simulink APIs. It is practically challenging for engineers, who must have a deep understanding of heavy equipment structures, to also possess programming skills including API usage. Thus, this paper proposes a tool that allows inputting configuration values for heavy equipment simulation and visually outputs and logs the simulation results. The proposed tool provides functionalities to deliver configuration values, such as engine settings of heavy equipment, to the simulator model and to monitor and log the resulting simulation outputs. These functionalities have been validated through scenarios. By using the developed tool, engineers are expected to reduce the burden of learning Simulink API and focus more on understanding the structure of heavy equipment. Additionally, it is anticipated that this tool will provide a more efficient and safer working environment for heavy equipment testing on construction sites."

At the 2023 exhibition of SuwonHwaseong museum, the manuscript of Chae Paengyun’s collection of works was revealed. The woodblock version Huiamjib is in 29 volumes, while the manuscript version PyeChu is in 18 volumes. Although the number of manuscripts is small, the number of works is greater than the woodblock version. The main trends in works deleted when published from manuscript to woodblock edition are as follows.First, many daily literary exchanges with in-laws were deleted. His literary activities were often carried out together with his father-in-law and brothers-in-law. Most of these works were deleted, and when published, they were included sporadically without any context. Because of this, the background of literary activities is not well understood. The manuscripts provide data to specifically understand the spatial context of his literary activities.Second, the aspects of friendship with the same party writers involved in Tagnam or Musinlan were deleted or reduced. Chae passed the civil exam the year of Gisahwangug occurred and was selected for the Dogseodang. Most of the writers who were selected at this time were writers who were classified as Tagnam. He had a deep relationship with them, and this friendship is evidenced by manuscripts. In the woodblock version, their friendship is greatly reduced. This meant that his grandson categorized his grandfather as an Cheongnam and reduced the level of interaction during the political situation during the reign of King Yeongjo.Third, Chae’s aspect to educate his young students with care and nurture them into national talents in the future has been reduced. He put effort into nurturing younger students in an unfavorable political situation after Gabsulhwangug. Among those students was Chae Jegong’s teacher Oh Gwangun. PyeChu contains Oh’s name from his childhood, and expresses the special affection Chae had for him as a son. In the woodblock version, the works about Oh and other young disciples are greatly reduced, and Oh also appears by name as an adult. Repetitive works on poetry learning and daily life were eliminated, and works related to Chae’s disciples were organized, focusing on Chae Jegong’s teacher Oh."

Since the rise of deep learning technology, various Creative AI challenges in the field of culture and arts have become visible, and similar attempts are being made in the field of Sino-poetry. Sino-poetry, a representative literary form of the East Asian culture, can be an effective medium to represent the performance of Creative AI due to its characteristics that emphasize connotation, style, rules, and images. In addition, genre big data based on web standard formats is required to trigger Creative AI, and Sino-poetry is fully equipped with this, making it very convenient to implement.There are dozens of Sino-poetry Creative AIs in existence, including <九歌>, <SikuGPT2>, <詩三百>. 九歌 is a Creative AI and implementation website created by Tsinghua University that uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) method. This Creative AI utilizes a public database of about 800,000 Sino-poetry and learns from its own database of about 100,000 Sino-poetry to create poems based on them. SikuGPT2 is a Creative AI created by Nanjing Agricultural University that uses GPT2's Causal Language Model (CLM) method. This Creative AI draws inspiration from extensive public databases, including around 300,000 Sino-poetry entries and the 󰡔四庫全書(Sikuquanshu)󰡕 database to fuel its creative processes. <詩三百> does not explicitly state its language model, but it reveals that in addition to the public databases mentioned above, it uses a 對聯(couplet) database containing about 700,000 couplet entries.While AI Creation for Sino-poetry has certain significance as a scalable implementation of AI Creative technology, the decline of Sino-poetry makes it difficult for the poems Created by AI to receive much more than cursory praise. Some takeaways, however, include the unexpected benefits of Sino-poetry in advancing Creative AI, the web-standardized format-based databases in China that have enabled rapid adoption of Creative AI, and the new context and insights that are generated in the process of guiding the training of Creative AI. In addition to the shortcomings commonly found in Creative AI, the work of Sino-poetry Creative AIs shows a tendency toward homogeneous creation, a lack of allusion, and an over-reliance on rules in Sino-poetry. Alternatives to these developmental weaknesses include using ""classical Sino-poetry criticism"" and accepting data from ""thesaurus"" as another valid variable in the function."

In this study, we propose a natural language processing (NLP)-based system that can predict judicial verdicts in traffic accident cases. The proposed system leverages NLP techniques to extract and analyze information related to traffic laws and regulations from textual descriptions of traffic accident scenarios, subsequently predicting sentencing information such as probation status and fines. The proposed system mainly consists of three parts: 1) data collection and preprocessing, 2) construction of a word dictionary and embedding, and 3) verdict prediction. First, traffic accident-related judgments are collected from various legal databases. Subsequently, key information such as imprisonment terms, probation status, and fines is extracted from the collected judgments, and a domain-specific word dictionary tailored to traffic accident cases is built using embedding techniques. Finally, the legal verdicts are predicted using a deep learning model. In our experiment, we validated the feasibility and applicability of the proposed system by implementing and applying it to approximately 37,406 traffic accident-related judgments, resulting in accuracies of 96.13%, 94.85%, and 95.49% for imprisonment, probation status, and fines, respectively."

With technological advancements overcoming the limitations of medical AI through training with databases, AI technology has made remarkable progress since the inception of deep learning for image processing with convolutional neural networks (CNN) in 2012. The recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have accelerated the utilization of AI through sophisticated natural language processing, enabling machines to identify and understand data regardless of the complexity of the language. This has laid the foundation for the rapid and precise development of generative AI. In the era where generative AI is being utilized without pausing in its developmental speed, we considered the civil liability of AI in our civil law principles, taking into account the inherent characteristics of AI such as unpredictability, opacity, and the black box effect.To do this, we first examined the legal liability considering the stages of AI technology development in discussing the tort liability caused by AI. Even “Weak AI,” created by AI developers, may fall under “Gefahr,” and while not all types, some may apply to strict liability in terms of risk liability. Furthermore, while reviewing civil liability applicable to AI under fault-based and no-fault liability, we also looked at the trends in the EU comparatively.In discussing no-fault liability, particularly under the Product Liability Act, we examined the possibility and implications of applying risk liability to pharmaceutical manufacturing using generative AI technology as a representative example to overcome the limitations of the existing Product Liability Act. Humanity currently lives in an era of rapid technological development and exploding big data, enjoying numerous benefits due to these advancements. As user convenience improves and massive added value is created through technological progress, the meaning of risk liability in the realm of civil liability can gain more significance. Generative AI has already drastically reduced the costs and time required for new drug development, providing substantial profits to pharmaceutical companies. However, even if the existing Product Liability Act is applied, it may be difficult to adequately remedy the harm to victims due to the reasonable alternative possibility defense regarding design defects. In the era of generative AI, we examined the possibility of applying enhanced risk liability by assuming the case of pharmaceutical manufacturing."

Nonetheless, it is the first book to be published in Korea under the name of ‘manga,’ which has drawn attention to its unique qualities.This paper aims to elucidate the circumstances that brought Torigoe Seiki to Gyeongseong (京城) and the relationship between his painting and his influences. Torigoe was born into a poor family in Okayama and struggled to learn Chinese writing and painting. In Korea under Tongam-bu(統監府), when Gyeongseong Newspaper (京城日報) was founded, he was interviewed by newspaper company president in Tokyo, and on the recommendation of Kosugi Misei (小杉未醒), who was there at the time, he got a job at the Gyeongseong Newspaper.When Torigoe came to Korea, he painted in the style of Kosugi, a former soldier in the Russo-Japanese War. He painted the most spectacular events in Gyeongseong in the style of war reportage painting, and depicted Korean customs in the style of cut paintings of Kosugi.However, he focused the spectacle value of the events and Korean customs, rather than showing the same deep understanding of Korean sentiment or history that Kosugi did. This was because he had close ties to imperialist Japanese journalists in Korea, including the Gyeongseong Newspaper and “Chosun” Magazine.He also met Kitazawa Rakuten (北沢楽天) of Tokyo Puck (東京パック), who came to Seoul to cover the story, and was deeply influenced by the ‘manga’ style. In fact, it can be said that the stereotypes of men depicted in Choseon Manga were almost entirely based on Kitazawa’s manga style.However, similarly, he did not reach the level of satire that Kitazawa did for various reasons.Torigoe was adopted by the Hosokibara family when he came to Korea in 1908 and renamed Hosokibara Seiki (細木原靑起). In the spring of 1909, he returned to Japan and continued to work as an illustrator in Japan, and in 1924, he wrote a History of Japanese manga (日本漫畵史). During his stay in Gyeongseong, he had neither the understanding nor the original pictorial style to overturn the distorted image of Korea that had recurred since the Russo-Japanese War. However, he can be understood as one of the first instances which was able to draw attention to the connection between imperialism and image in Korea."
지시문을 활용한 동형암호 프로그램 코드 분할 컴파일러,2024,[],"클라우드 컴퓨팅이 널리 사용되면서, 데이터 유출에 대한 관심도 같이 증가하고 있다. 동형암호는 데이터를 암호화된 채로 클라우드 서버에서 연산을 수행함으로써 해당 문제를 해결할 수 있다. 그러나, 프로그램 전체를 동형암호로 연산하는 것은 큰 오버헤드를 가지고 있다. 프로그램의 일부분만 동형암호를 사용하는 것은 오버헤드를 줄일 수 있지만, 사용자가 직접 프로그램의 코드를 분할하는 것은 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업이고 또한 에러를 발생시킬 수 있다. 이 연구는 지시문을 활용하여 동형암호 프로그램의 코드를 분할하는 컴파일러인 Heapa를 제시하였다. 사용자가 프로그램에 클라우드 컴퓨팅 영역에 대한 코드를 지시문으로 삽입하면 Heapa는 클라우드 서버와 호스트사이의 통신 및 암호화를 적용시킨 계획을 세우고, 분할된 프로그램을 생성한다.

Homomorphic encryption (HE) can resolve the concerns by allowing cloud servers to compute on encrypted data without decryption. However, due to the huge computation overhead of HE, simply executing an entire cloud program with HE causes significant computation. Manually partitioning the program and applying HE only to the partitioned program for the cloud can reduce the computation overhead. However, the manual code partitioning and HE-transformation are time-consuming and error-prone. This work proposes a new homomorphic encryption enabled annotation-guided code partitioning compiler, called Heapa, for privacy preserving cloud computing. Heapa allows programmers to annotate a program about the code region for cloud computing. Then, Heapa analyzes the annotated program, makes a partition plan with a variable list that requires communication and encryption, and generates a homomorphic encryptionenabled partitioned programs. Moreover, Heapa provides not only two region-level partitioning annotations, but also two instruction-level annotations, thus enabling a fine-grained partitioning and achieving better performance. For six machine learning and deep learning applications, Heapa achieves a 3.61 times geomean performance speedup compared to the non-partitioned cloud computing scheme."

As a representing the ""Nosa school"" and a symbolic figure of Honam Confucianism, he wore deep robe <Gosanseowon collection> is a solemn and neat portrait with deep robe that can show the visualization of the academic background, and <Buguk Culture Foundation collection> in ordinary clothes shows Ki Woo-man's appearance as a Confucian scholar. It is believed that the reason why Chae Yong-shin produced the two portraits differently is because there was an intention of the academic group or the family that was the order.After producing the portrait of Ki Woo-man, Chae Yong-shin produced portraits of Ki Jeong-jin and Ki Woo-man followers, including Oh Jun-seon, Ko Gwang-seon, Shim Won-pyo, Chae Myeon-muk, and Wi gyeong-ryong. All of these were people who preserved modern Honam Confucian culture and led Confucian scholars while inheriting their academic background by cultivating their younger students through continuous academic activities. Chae Yong-shin showed characteristics by appropriately using their costumes and various items, giving each person's identity. Meanwhile, after Jo Yong-shin, many portraits of Confucian scholars in Honam were produced by Seolsan Choi Kwang-ik.

A study on the content of Korean spiritual culture education using Arirang : Focusing on the emotion of Han(恨),2024,"['한국어교육', '한(恨)', '아리랑', '정신문화', '문화교육', 'Korean language education', 'Han(恨)', 'Arirang', 'spiritual culture', 'cultural education']","배경: 본고는 한국어 학습자를 위한 한국의 한(恨)에 대한 정신문화 교육에 관한 연구이다. ‘정신문화’ 는 인간의 정신적 활동으로 형성된 문화, 도덕, 종교, 학술, 사상, 예술 등을 아우르는 말이다. ‘한국의 정신문화’는 한국인들끼리만 공유되고 있는 특별한 정신 활동이라 할 수 있다. 정신 활동에는 사람의 마음에 일어나는 여러 가지 감정 또는 감정을 불러일으키는 기분이나 분위기인 정서가 포함된다. 한국인 들이 ‘그렇게 언행 하는 것’을 알기 위해서는 그 언행을 하게 하는 정신 활동의 ‘기인이 어디에 있는 가’에 대한 이해가 있어야만 한다. 목적: 한국어교육에 있어 우리 삶의 표층을 이루고 있는 행동문화와 성취문화 못지않게 심층을 구성하고 있는 관념문화인 정신문화를 다른 영역에 앞서 교육할 필요가 있다. 가시적인 현상과 행동이 있게 하는, 어떤 일에 대한 견해나 생각 즉 ‘관념’은 사물을 느끼고 생각하며 판단하는 마음의 자세나 태도 즉 ‘정신’에 있다고 할 수 있기 때문이다. 따라서 아리랑이라는 교육자료를 활용하여 한국어 학습자가 접 근하기 어려운 한(恨)에 대한 정신문화 내용을 파악하여 한국어 학습자의 능통한 의사소통 능력과 문화 능력의 함양에 도움이 되고자 하는 것을 목표로 한다. 방법론/접근: 첫째 한(恨)의 정서에 대한 개념 정립하고, 둘째 아리랑의 형성과 유형을 살펴보고, 셋째 아 리랑의 내용 통해서 한국의 정신문화 교육으로 한(恨)의 내용을 분석하였다. 결과/결론: 한국적 한(恨)의 정서를 이해하기 위해 아리랑의 내용을 분석하였다. 결과 정선아리랑은 망국 의 나라를 지켜볼 수밖에 없는 충신의 한(恨)이, 밀양아리랑은 절개를 지킨 아랑의 한(恨)이, 진도아리랑 은 오랜 역사 속에 지켜낸 삶에 대한 애환의 한(恨)이 고스란히 담겨 있었다. 한국어 학습자는 아리랑의 사설을 통해서 한(恨)을 이해하는 데 도움을 받게 될 것이며, 나아가 한국어 능력 향상에 도움을 받게 될 것이다. 이에 아리랑은 한국적 한(恨)의 정신문화 교육 확장 및 연계성을 갖기에 충분하다. 시사점: 아리랑의 사설을 통해 한국의 한(恨)의 정신문화 교육의 확장 및 연계성을 확인할 수 있으며 한 국어 학습자를 대상으로 보다 심도 있는 정신문화 교육의 가능성을 시사한다.","Background: This paper is a study on the spiritual culture education about Korean han (恨) for Korean language learners. ‘Mental culture’ encompasses culture, scholarship, ideology, religion, art, and morality achieved through human mental activities. ‘Korea’s spiritual culture’ can be said to be a special mental activity shared only among Koreans. Mental activity includes emotions, which are moods or moods that evoke various feelings or emotions that occur in a person's mind. In order to know why Koreans ‘say things like that’, there must be an understanding of ‘where the origins’ of the mental activities that lead to those words and actions lie. Purpose: In Korean language education, it is necessary to prioritize mental culture, which is the ideological culture that forms the deep layer, as much as the culture of behavior and achievement that forms the surface layer of our lives. This is because the opinion or idea, or ‘idea,’ about something that causes visible phenomena and actions can be said to be in the ‘spirit,’ or the attitude or attitude of the mind that feels, thinks, and judges things. Therefore, by using the educational material called Arirang, the goal is to help Korean language learners learn the mental and cultural contents of Han (恨), which are difficult to access, and to develop fluent communication skills and cultural skills of Korean language learners. Methodology/Approach: First, the concept of the emotion of resentment is established, second, the formation and type of Arirang are examined, and third, the contents of the education of resentment are revealed through the contents of Arirang through the education of Korean spiritual culture. Findings/Conclusions: Jeongseon Arirang is the sorrow of a loyal subject who has no choice but to watch the country fall into ruin, Milyang Arirang is the sorrow of an Arang who maintained fidelity, and Jindo Arirang is the sorrow of the joys and sorrows of a life that has been preserved throughout its long history. It is fully contained. Arirang's editorials are sufficient to expand and connect the spiritual culture education of Korean resentment. Implications: Through Arirang's lyrics, we can confirm the expansion and connection of Korea's spiritual culture education of Han (恨), and suggest the possibility of more in-depth cultural education for Korean language learners."

However, these AI-based IDS models are often biased toward the majority class due to the data imbalance problem between normal and abnormal classes, resulting in poor detection performance for minority classes. Additionally, it is extremely difficult to detect new types of attack data that have not been seen before. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines Resampling and Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation(ADDA) to comprehensively solve these problems. To alleviate the data imbalance problem, Resampling techniques ADASYN and Tomek Links were used, and an ADDA was introduced to overcome the limitations of new attack detection. The NSL-KDD qintrusion detection dataset was used in the experiment.As a result of the experiment, the proposed method was about 8% higher than the deep learning model learning result without applying Resampling and ADDA, and showed overall improved classification performance. This approach is expected to excel in intrusion detection, network in- cident response, and vulnerability analysis in defense cyber operations, and is expected to contribute to creating a more robust and secure digital environment for private and public sector cyber security."
연극치료를 활용한 문학교육과 치유-비블리오드라마를 중심으로-,2024,"['교수법', '문학교육', '비블리오드라마', '셰익스피어', '연극치료', 'Bibliodrama', 'Drama Therapy', 'Literature Education', 'Shakespeare', 'Teaching Method']","인류가 존재한 이후로 다양한 형태의 교육이 이루어져 왔고, 효율적인 교수법에 대한 고민도 지속적으로 이어져 왔다. 대학에서 문학교육을 하고 있는 필자 또한 같은 고민을 하면서 다양한 교수법을 고민해 왔다. 문학교육을 하는 목적은 단순히 문학 작품을 분석하고 이해하는 데 그치지 않고 학습을 통해 학습자가 다양한 통찰을 하고 자아 성장을 이룸과 동시에 치유의 효과까지 성취함으로써 현실에서 더욱더 건강한 삶을 영위해 나갈 수 있도록 하는 것이 중요하다고 생각한다. 그런 면에서 대학생들을 대상으로 셰익스피어의 A Midsummer Night's Dream(『한여름 밤의 꿈』)을 텍스트로 문학, 특히 극문학 수업을 하는 데 있어 심리상담 및 교육 분야에 주로 사용되는 비블리오드라마(도서심리극)를 교수법으로 사용해 그 효과에 대해 살펴보았다.연구 방법으로는 문헌 연구와 관찰을 통한 경험적 연구 방법으로 진행하였다. 작가와 작품에 대한 강의, 텍스트 읽기와 자료 조사 후 토론, 영상 시청을 활용한 학습을 한 후 추가로 비블리오드라마를 경험하기 전과 후에 작가, 작품, 등장인물에 대한 이해, 비블리오드라마 경험하는 도중과 후에 느끼는 학습 효과, 통찰과 역할 훈련의 효과 등을 묻는 내용의 사전/사후검사를 하여 비블리오드라마의 교수법으로서의 효과성 검증을 하였다.그 결과 비블리오드라마를 경험하기 전에 여러 교수법의 효과도 있는 것으로 나타났으나, 거기에 더해 비블리오드라마를 교수법으로 사용 후 학습효과가 유의미하게 긍정적인 것으로 나타났다. 그 결과를 살펴보면 아래와 같다.  1. 수업 중 학습자들이 극문학 학습을 더 즐겁고 활기차게 해 나갈 수 있고 이 과정에서 다양한 카타르시스를 느낄 수 있다. 2. 작품 전체와 등장인물들을 더욱더 입체적이고 깊이 있게 느끼고 이해할 수 있다. 3. 비블리오드라마를 통해 개인적인 통찰을 경험하고 자신의 삶을 되돌아볼 기회를 제공한다. 4. ‘역할 훈련(Role Training)'이 이루어져 학습자들이 자신을 그 상황에 대입시켜 현실에서의 유사한 상황을 경험하게 될 때 유연하고 적절하게 대처할 수 있는 힘을 기를 수 있게 된다. 이로써 비블리오드라마를 교수법으로 활용했을 때 깊이 있는 교육 효과뿐만 아니라 카타르시스, 통찰 역할 훈련이라는 심리치료로서의 효과도 달성할 수 있다는 것을 알 수 있다.이외에도 비블리오드라마 과정에서 학습자들이 표현하는 언행을 통해 교육자로서 학습자에 대한 이해도가 높아져 학생 지도에도 도움을 받을 수 있다. 더불어 이러한 이유로 비블리오드라마를 활용한 극문학 교육방식은 교실을 넘어 연극 배우들의 연기훈련에도 큰 도움이 될 것이라 기대할 수 있다.","This study aims to examine the effect of bibliodrama in literature education as a teaching method.  Various teaching methods have been used in literature education. For this study, Lectures, reading texts, discussions, and watching videos are used as teaching tools in literature class for university students. In addition, we explored how and to what effect the additional use of bibliodrama, which is widely used in psychotherapy and educational settings, would be effective. Bibliodrama was conducted two times for 120~150 min. each. A pre-post test was conducted to determine understanding of the author, work, and characters and the effects of insight and role training and various learning effects during and after the bibliodrama sessions. The learning effect significantly improved after the bibliodrama sessions.The results of the study are as follows. First, During class, learners can learn dramatic literature more happily and energetically, and feel various catharsis in the process. Second, Learners can feel and understand the entire work and its characters in a more three-dimensional and deeper way. Third, it provides opportunities for learners to experience personal insight and reflect on their lives through bibliodrama. Fourth, ‘Role Training’ is provided so that learners can develop the ability to respond flexibly and appropriately when they experience similar situations in reality by putting themselves into the situation. This shows that when bibliodrama is used as a teaching method, it can achieve not only a deep educational effect, but also a psychotherapeutic effect such as catharsis, insight and role training."
실사용 환경에 적합한 EMG 기반 손동작 인식을 위한 전처리로서의 Wavelet Transform,2024,"['Electromyograph', 'Hand gesture recognition', 'Actual user-environment Wavelet transform', 'TQWT']","손동작이란 기본적인 잡기 동작뿐만 아니라 의사소통을 위한 제스처 등을 포함하며 사람의 일상생활에서 상당히 중요한 역할을 수행한다. 이러한 손동작을 인식하여 HCI(Human Computer Interface) 로 활용하기 위해 표면근전도(sEMG : Surface Electromyography)를 이용한 손동작 인식 분야는 꾸준히 연구되어 왔다. 근전도 신호는 기본적으로 많은 잡음 요소가 존재하기 때문에 손동작을 인식하기 위해 다양한 전처리 신호처리 기법이 개발되었고, 특히 주파수 분석을 위해 웨이블릿 변환(WT: Wavelet Transform)이 자주 사용된다. 따라서 본 논문에서는 웨이블릿 변환 기반의 3가지의 기법을 비교하여 손동작 인식 분야의 실제 사용 환경에 가장 적합한 기법을 선택한다. 손동작 인식 분야의 주된 목표인 실시간 인식을 위해 각 기법에서의 처리시간과 동작 인식 정확도를 비교하였으며, 비교된 웨이블릿 변환 기법은 각각 DWT(Discrete WT, single level), TQWT(Tunable Q-factor WT), CWT(Continuous WT)이다. 비교에 사용된 데이터세트는 서로 다른 5명의 대상에게 수집된 15가지 손동작을 포함하고 있으며, 먼저 각 3가지 기법으로 특징을 추출하고 딥러닝 분류기(가벼운 CNN)를 사용하여 손동작을 인식한다. 손동작 인식이 이루어지는 각 과정에서 처리시간이 기록되고 최종적으로 15가지 손동작에 대한 평균 정확도가 계산된다. 결과 TQWT와 CWT에서 유사한 약 75%의 평균 정확도를 얻었지만 인식 과정에 소요되는 시간이 TQWT에서 0.08초, CWT에서 0.26초였다. 따라서 정확도 측면에서 비슷한 성능을 보이면서 처리시간이 빠른 TQWT가 손동작 인식의 실제 사용 환경에 적합한 기법임을 보여주었다.","Hand gestures include not only grasping movements but also gestures for communication and using very important role in daily life. The field of hand gesture recognition using surface electromyography (sEMG) has been studied to recognize these hand movements and use them as HCI (Human Computer Interface). Since electromyography signals basically have many noise elements, various pre-processing techniques have been developed to recognize hand gestures, and Wavelet Transform (WT) is frequently used for frequency analysis. Therefore, in this paper, three pre-processing techniques based on wavelet transform are compared to select the most suitable technique for the actual user-environment in the field of hand gesture recognition. Processing time and gesture recognition accuracy in each technique were compared for real-time recognition, which is the main goal of the field of hand gesture recognition, and the compared wavelet transform techniques are DWT (Discrete WT), TQWT (Tunable Q-factor WT), and CWT (Continuous WT). The dataset used in the comparison contains 15 hand gestures collected from five different subjects, first extracting features with each of the three techniques and recognizing hand gestures using a deep learning classifier (light CNN). In each process in which hand gesture recognition is performed, processing time is recorded, and finally, the average accuracy for 15 hand gestures is calculated. The results obtained similar average accuracy of about 75% in TQWT and CWT, but the time required for the recognition process was 0.08 seconds in TQWT and 0.26 seconds in CWT. Therefore, it was shown that TQWT with fast processing time is a suitable technique for the actual user-environment of hand gesture recognition, showing similar performance in terms of accuracy."

It also seeks to establish, as far as possible, the influence of such things on Wilhelm II’s beliefs, attitudes, feelings, disposition, and behavior. In doing so, I have attempted to supplement or criticize Röhl's views on the causes of the German emperor's vengeful, aggressive, and violent tendencies and behavior.As this research has shown, the education or instruction that Wilhelm II received encouraged in him, in various ways and at times relatively strongly or more strongly, in particular courage, racism, nationalism, patriotism, anti-Catholicism, anti-Semitism, a view of history as a struggle, expansionism, colonialism, the spread of Christianity, the maintenance and expansion of the fleet, the futility of dialogue, heroism, the futility of tolerance, hostility toward enemies, and cruel punitive, revengeful, and violent tendencies and behavior.In so doing, such instruction or instructional content appears to has influenced Wilhelm II to make the futility of tolerance, nationalism, monarchism, anti-Catholicism, anti-Socialism, anti-Semitism, anti-French, expansionism, colonialism, the propagation of Christianity and the building of a great fleet creeds to be pursued and continually and consistently demonstrate modeling and following heroes, heroism, and hostility to enemies, both foreign and domestic, and punitive, vengeful, and violent tendencies and acts, and, moreover, intense hostility and ruthless, cruel, destructive, murderous, slaughtering, genocidal, and exterminating punitive-revengeful-violent tendencies and acts.Wilhelm II's displeasure at having his ""Germanic feelings"" ""wounded"" by reading Caesar's Biography of the Gauls, which describes the Roman army's victory over the ancient Germanic peoples, taking no prisoners and committing genocide and satisfaction with the ancient Germanic victory over the brutally violent Roman army and extermination of it demonstrate to some extent that classical language education or educational content influenced the impressionable young Wilhelm II to exhibit hostility toward and ruthless, cruel, destructive, murderous, slaughtering, genocidal, and exterminating punitive-revengeful-violent tendencies and acts against the above-mentioned enemies.On July 27, 1900, more than 20 years after Getting a history education on Friedrich the Great or learning of it, Wilhelm II, in his ""Hun Speech"" at Bremerhaven, furiously declared that ""no leniency will be granted"" to the ""insolent,"" ""criminal,"" ""barbaric,"" murderous, and murderous enemy and no prisoners will be made"". This words is almost identical to the orders given by Friedrich the Great from history textbooks, as he and his troops fought with extreme hostility against the brutal Russian army that was ravaging Prussia, harming men, women, and children alike.This similarity once again proves that Wilhelm II loved, admired, modeled, and followed Friedrich the Great and his heroism. The similarity also proves in itself that such education or instructional content influenced Wilhelm II's behavior by conveying information about the feelings, dispositions, and actions of his ""hero"" Friedrich the Great, because an uninfluenced person would hardly say the same thing.The above discussion demonstrates that the education Wilhelm II received or learned was one of the sources of his aggressive, punitive, vengeful, and violent tendencies and behavior. Moreover, it appears to be a more important source than the manic-depressive or cyclical manic-depressive illnesses that Röhl claims as such a source."

When advertisements are delivered in the form of the news article, it becomes difficult to activate consumers’ persuasion knowledge, thus increasing the likelihood of consumers trusting the content of the advertisement. For this reason, advertorial is frequently used as a promotion tool, and research on its characteristics and effects has been actively conducted. This study classified products featured in advertorial as virtues or vices to examine the positive responses of consumers and investigated how the type of advertisement interacts with the timing of its placement. Advertorials posted on the Naver portal in 2019 were analyzed and classified using text mining techniques, and 406 advertorials published both in the morning and evening were selected considering the impact of the timing of placement on responses. The number of positive emoticons used by consumers was measured as an indicator of positive response, which was significantly higher when the advertorials were posted in the evening compared to the morning. The interaction between advertorials and the timing of placement was not significant, but the effect of timing was marginally significant for vice advertorials, while it was not significant for virtue advertorials. This implies that the timing of placement should be more carefully considered for vice advertorials. Applying the distinction between virtue and vice in various aspects of everyday life to online media is very rare, and this study is distinguished from previous research in that it applies this distinction to advertorials, and online medium. Furthermore, the use of a deep learning technique based on KoBERT, rather than the commonly used English-based BERT, for extracting and classifying advertorials, allowed for higher accuracy in classification. Along with these theoretical implications, the result that responses to advertorials as a promotional tool are more positive later in the day has practical implications.

욥기 21:1-7의 욥의 외상을 통해 본 목회 돌봄 프락시스,2024,"['욥의 외상 경험', '외상 기억', '감정 체계', '속울음', '경청', ""Job's Traumatic Experience"", 'Traumatic Memory', 'Emotional System', 'Mute Cry', 'Listening']","본 연구는 욥기 21:1-7을 중심으로 욥의 외상 경험과 논증에 나타난 정신신체 반응과 특징의 이해를 통해 목회 돌봄의 의미와 경청 프락시스(praxis)를 제시하는 데 목적이 있다. 욥의 외상과 신체 경험의 관계, 욥의 외상 기억의 특징, 욥의 분노 감정에 내포된 속울음(mute cry) 등에 대한 이해와 함께, 욥이 외상 고통 중에 공동체에 요구했던 목소리를 통해 교회 공동체의 경청 문화 형성의 중요성을 밝힌다.욥의 외상에 나타난 정신신체 반응을 통해 외상 중에 있는 사람의 신체 반응에 대한 이해의 중요성을 강조한다. 외상 돌봄에서 신체 반응에 먼저 주의를 기울이지 않고 바로 분노, 죄책감, 슬픔을 다루게 되면 감정은 오히려 강화될 수 있기 때문이다. 특히 외상은 몸 안에서 시작하고 마음이 뒤따르는 특성이 있다는 것을 밝힌다.욥의 외상 기억은 명시적(explicit) 기억보다는 암묵적(implicit) 기억에 더 가까운 특징이 있다는 것을 밝힌다. 암묵적 기억은 신체와 감정에 각인되는 특징이 있다. 따라서 외상 기억은 몸의 떨림과 마비 등과 같은 증상을 초래할 수 있다는 것을 밝힌다. 나아가 외상 기억을 이야기할 때 외상이 더 증폭될 수 있지만, 외상 경험을 증언할 때 완화되는 특성이 있다는 것도 제시한다. 이를 위해 해체 반응 기법, 즉 고통의 경험에서 온 감정적 과도함을 없애기 위해 증언하게 하여 다시 경험하게 하는 방법을 제시한다. 이 기법은 원래의 외상 상황에서는 압도되어서 자기 보호의 실패로 이어졌던 외상 기억을 긍정적으로 업데이트시키는 역할을 할 수도 있다는 것을 밝힌다.교회 공동체가 외상 중에 있는 사람의 증언을 경청하는 것은 그들의 고통과 함께하는 것이며, 그들과 함께 어떻게 울어야 하는지를 배우는 여정임을 강조한다. 본 연구는 외상 고통 중에 있는 사람들의 애가와 분노에 대한 경청의 중요성을 강조한다. 특히 외상 중에 있는 사람의 분노 감정 체계와 특징에 대한 분석을 통해, 분노의 이면과 심층 감정에 자리하고 있는 속울음의 특징을 밝힌다. 외상 중에 있는 사람의 분노 감정은 항의, 논쟁, 고뇌, 의문, 상처, 불안, 수용과 같은 감정이 내포되어 있을 뿐만 아니라 이러한 감정의 기재들이 서로 연결되어 있다는 것을 밝힌다. 교회 공동체는 외상 중에 있는 사람들의 이야기와 증언을 경청하며, 이들의 속울음까지 들을 수 있을 때, 이들도 욥과 같이 외상 후 성장을 경험할 수 있다는 것을 강조한다.","This study aims to present the meaning of pastoral care and the praxis of listening through understanding the psychosomatic reactions and characteristics revealed in Job's traumatic experience and arguments, focusing on Job 21:1-7. Along with an understanding of the relationship between Job's trauma and physical experience, the characteristics of Job's traumatic memories, and the mute cry contained in Job's anger, the importance of forming a listening culture in the church community is revealed through the voice that Job demanded from the community during his traumatic suffering.The psychosomatic responses to Job's trauma highlight the importance of understanding the physical responses of people in trauma. This is because in trauma care, if we deal with anger, guilt, and sadness right away without first paying attention to the physical reactions, then the emotions may actually be strengthened. In particular, it reveals that trauma has the characteristic of starting in the body and being followed by the mind.Job's traumatic memories reveal characteristics closer to implicit memory than explicit memory. Implicit memories have the characteristic of being imprinted on the body and emotions. Therefore, it is revealed that traumatic memories can cause symptoms such as body tremors and paralysis. Furthermore, it suggests that while trauma may be amplified when talking about traumatic memories, there are also characteristics that are mitigated when testifying about traumatic experiences. For this purpose, we propose a deconstruction response method, where people testify and experience it again in order to eliminate the emotional excess from the experience of pain. This technique reveals that it may serve to positively update traumatic memories that were originally overwhelming and led to failures in self-protection.It is emphasized that when the church community listens to the testimony of a person experiencing trauma, it is a journey of sharing their pain and learning how to cry with them. This study highlights the importance of listening to the grief and anger of people suffering from trauma. In particular, through analysis of the anger emotional system and characteristics of people suffering from trauma, we reveal the characteristics of mute crying that lie behind anger and deep emotions. It reveals that the anger of a person experiencing trauma not only contains emotions such as protest, conflict, agony, doubt, hurt, anxiety, and acceptance, but also that these emotional registers are connected to each other. The church community emphasizes that when it listens to the stories and testimonies of people who are experiencing trauma, and even hears their mute cry, they too can experience post-traumatic growth like Job."

By comparing and analyzing case laws and legislation from various countries, as well as introducing diverse discussions from the academic community, this article offers a multifaceted examination of the relevant issues. Despite the fundamental changes in the creative environment brought about by advanced AI technologies, the current copyright law, designed with a focus on human creators, has limitations. The article suggests that the decision to grant copyright protection to AI-generated works should be based on whether the creativity of the work is sufficient to warrant protection as a copyrighted work. Through a thorough analysis of the AI Madam Suro case recognized as a compilation work by the Korea Copyright Commission, the U.S. Copyright Office’s decision to refuse registration of AI-generated works, the computer-generated works provision in the U.K. copyright law, and the Chinese court rulings protecting AI-generated works, this article identifies the positions of different countries and derives implications.Furthermore, the article analyzes the issue of copyright infringement during the AI training process. The collection and preprocessing of vast amounts of data are essential for AI training, and this process may lead to potential copyright infringement issues. There is a need to establish a reasonable scope of exemption for the use of works for deep learning purposes while ensuring that the rights of copyright holders are not excessively infringed upon during the data usage process. Under the current copyright law, copyright infringement can be established if the requirements of reliance and substantial similarity are met, but there is also a possibility of exemption under the fair use doctrine. Recently, numerous copyright infringement lawsuits have been filed against AI companies in the United States, drawing attention to this issue. Meanwhile, countries such as the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan have introduced text and data mining (TDM) exemption provisions, allowing the free use of copyrighted works under certain conditions. In South Korea, a proposed amendment to the Copyright Act, which includes the introduction of TDM exemption provisions, has been submitted. The copyright regulation of the AI training process should aim to harmoniously realize the two values of technological innovation and protection of creators."
환웅의 홍익인간 이념 재해석과 생태학적 공생 가치,2024,"['홍익인간', '생태학적 공생', '홍익지구촌', '인류세', '특이점', '포스트휴먼', '전자인간', 'humanitarianism', 'ecological symbiosis', 'humanitarian global village', 'Anthropocene', 'Singularity', 'post-humans', 'electronic personhood']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This study aims to point out several problems in the existing theory of Hongik Human (humanitarianism) and reinterpret the humanitarian ideal based on the achievements of Hwanwoong, the main agent of this ideology. Further, the study identifies the value of ecological symbiosis from the perspective of bon-puri (Korean shamanic narratives or mythology) concept of history, and applies its usefulness to the post-human era. Since Hwanwoong, the son of the king of heaven, descended from heaven to earth to practice the spirit of humanitarianism. By retracing and analyzing his activities on earth, the true meaning of humanitarianism can be interpreted. The meaning will be discussed through both holistic interpretation based on the narratives of historical records related to the Hwanwoong bon-puri and analytical interpretation based on his specific activities.  From a holistic point of view, gods, humans, and animals in the Hwanwoong bon-puri exist relatively, but are all cyclical beings whose existence alternates between the three categories of entity. In the next life, the god may live as a human; an animal may live as a human; and a human may live as the god, freely crossing the boundaries between the three entities. Therefore, the essence of humanitarianism is that humans, gods, and animals are not differential but equal in relations by interacting with one another in a symbiotic manner.  From an analytical point of view, Hwanwoong practiced the spirit of sustainable symbiosis by adapting to the changing climate while controlling the wind and rain, doing farming in a symbiotic relationship with nature, and protecting the globe as a global village where all living creatures were connected to each other. When foreign immigrants, symbolized as the bear and tiger, came to Hwanwoong, not only did he help them get what they wanted on their side, but even when Ungnyeo (bear woman) asked him to marry her, he granted her wish after transforming into a human being, ultimately achieving a true symbiosis by breaking the barrier between the god and the animal. The generalization of the value of symbiosis implied in humanitarianism expands to the idea of ‘humanitarian global village’: dedicating yourself to benefit all things in heaven and earth.  Our global village is now facing a technological crisis in the context of ‘Singularity’ as well as an ecological crisis in the context of ‘Anthropocene’. If the crucial point of Singularity is reached in the future, considerable advances in artificial intelligence(AI) would far surpass human abilities; thus, humans could no longer keep AI under control. This state of emergency would inevitably lead to the advent of post-human era during which AI would be the dominant influence. The number of post-human populations, such as cyborgs and androids, would be growing quickly, and thus humans, who are of relatively low intelligence and physically weak, would inevitably give way to post-humans. Humans might be driven out of their jobs and get under the control of cyborgs and androids.  In that sense, the only way to prevent such a grim future for humanity is to realize symbiosis as the highest value. Humans’ pursuit of symbiosis with other living creatures can be applied to deep learning for AI because AI can learn the values sought by humanity. Therefore, instead of treating androids like servants, we should provide them with personality rights and find ways to have a symbiotic relationship with them as electronic personhood. Consequently, the ideology of humanitarianism, where symbiosis among humans, gods, and animals is valued, should be developed as an idea to overcome the ecological crisis, as well as an alternative to practice symbiosis between humans and electronic personhood in the future post-human era."

Korea, which has consistently been evaluated as a top country, can clearly be said to be a leading country in the world of e-government. The lubricant of e-government is data. Data itself is neither information nor a record, but it is a source of information and records and a resource of knowledge. Since administrative actions through electronic systems have become widespread, the production and technology of data-based records have naturally expanded and evolved. Technology may seem value-neutral, but in fact, technology itself reflects a specific worldview.The digital order of new technologies, armed with hyper-connectivity and super-intelligence, not only has a profound influence on traditional power structures, but also has an a similar influence on existing information and knowledge transmission media. Moreover, new technologies and media, including data-based generative artificial intelligence, are by far the hot topic. It can be seen that the all-round growth and spread of digital technology has led to the augmentation of human capabilities and the outsourcing of thinking. This also involves a variety of problems, ranging from deep fakes and other fake images, auto profiling, AI lies hallucination that creates them as if they were real, and copyright infringement of machine learning data. Moreover, radical connectivity capabilities enable the instantaneous sharing of vast amounts of data and rely on the technological unconscious to generate actions without awareness. Another irony of the digital world and online network, which is based on immaterial distribution and logical existence, is that access and contact can only be made through physical tools. Digital information is a logical object, but digital resources cannot be read or utilized without some type of device to relay it.In that respect, machines in today’s technological society have gone beyond the level of simple assistance, and there are points at which it is difficult to say that the entry of machines into human society is a natural change pattern due to advanced technological development.This is because perspectives on machines will change over time.Important is the social and cultural implications of changes in the way records are produced as a result of communication and actions through machines.Even in the archive field, what problems will a data-based archive society face due to technological changes toward a hyper-intelligence and hyper-connected society, and who will prove the continuous activity of records and data and what will be the main drivers of media change? It is time to research whether this will happen. This study began with the need to recognize that archives are not only records that are the result of actions, but also data as strategic assets. Through this, author considered how to expand traditional boundaries and achieves reterritorialization in a data-driven society."
김승옥 소설의 분열적 인간성 -죽음충동을 중심으로-,2024,"['Lacan', 'The real', 'death impulse', 'divisiveness', 'Hegel', 'love', 'evil', '라캉', '실재계', '죽음충동', '분열성', '헤겔', '사랑', '악']","본고는 김승옥 소설에 드러난 인간의 본질을 ‘분열성’으로 정의하고 탐구를 시도하였다. 특히 라캉 정신분석학의 ‘죽음충동’이라는 개념에 착안하여 죽음충동을 매개로 분열하고 있는 인간의 순수성을 ‘자기세계’의 개념으로 도출하였다. 김승옥의 ‘자기세계’는 수많은 연구의 대상이 되어왔으나 그 애매모호한 성격, ‘악’의 냄새와 광기의 몸짓이 새로운 감수성의 색채로 덧칠되어 있는 탓에 명확하게 의미화되지 못했다. 본고는 이 연구사의 교착상태를 풀어낼 해결책으로 라캉 정신분석학의 ‘실재계’, 그 중에서도 ‘충동’의 ‘생명성’을 제출하는 바이다. 시대를 외면하고 개인주의에만 함몰되어 있다는 일각의 시선과는 다르게, 본고는 그가 1960년대의 시대성을 충실히 구현해내고 있음과 더불어 1960년대를 넘어 현시대에도 여전히 진리를 전달할 사도의 역할을 할 수 있음을 제시해보이고자 한다. 그는 무기력한 전후문학에 생명의 고동을 부여하고자 했던 혁명적인 소설가이기 때문이다.이를 위해 먼저 2절에서는 각 작품에 드러난 죽음충동의 양상들을 추적해보았다. 김승옥적 주체들은 ‘극기’를 통해 상징계라는 하나의 세계를 형성하면서 ‘지나치게 많은 생명’으로서의 순수한 악, 죽음충동의 행위를 저항적으로 분출한다. 이러한 생명의 충동은 상징계적 주체들에게 증상으로서, 동물과 여성의 형상으로서 무두적으로 지속된다. 상징계의 ‘힘’의 논리, 폭력성과 거짓, 속물성을 혐오하고 귀여운 토끼와 새끼염소를 사랑하면서도, 주체는 분열의 진공 상태에 스스로 몸을 담근다. 성장한다는 것, 타자들의 세계, 서울에서 살아갈 수밖에 없음을 씁쓸하게 인정하며 지옥 같은 타인들의 틈에 들어서지 않을 수 없는 인간 실존의 본성을 지적한다. 이것은 속물성에 대한 어쩔 수 없다는 긍정이 아니라 타자들의 세계로 진입하지 않을 수 없는 인간의 존재론적 성질에 관한 김승옥의 통찰이다.3절에서는 이러한 이율배반적 위치에 관한 인간의 분열성을 집중적으로 살펴보려고 시도하였다. 김승옥은 분열성의 간극, 사이의 공간에서 발생하는 죽음충동의 생명과 자유, 사랑, 혁명을 형상화한다. 죽음충동의 생명성을 보유하면서도 생존해야 한다는 인간적 ‘본능’을 가진 주체들의 양상은 선과 악이라는 상징계적 도덕을 넘어선 여성 인물들에게 적극적으로 투영되고 있다. 여기서 도덕과 윤리의 구분은 중요하다. 도덕을 넘어서는 윤리는 오히려 타인들에 대한 도덕을 깊게 체화한 주체에게서나 기대될 수 있는 것이기 때문이다. 즉 타인에게 피해와 상처를 주지 않으려는 상징계적 도덕은 그로 인한 나르시시즘적 이익, 대타자에게 선하게 보임으로써 획득되는 사회적, 정념적 이해관계에서 자유롭지 못하다. 이러한 방식으로 상징계적 상블랑을 학습한 인물들은 오히려 위선적, 이데올로기적이다. 그러나 타인에 대한 예의, 배려, 도덕을 깊은 ‘사랑’이라는 윤리적 자세로 수용한 인물들은 도덕과 윤리가 상충하는 순간 윤리를 지향하는 위악의 행위를 도맡는다. 라캉에게 윤리가 실재계에 속한다는 점을 주지할 때 김승옥의 생명은 바로 이 위악성으로, 부자유하게 평온한 양옥집을 부수는 ‘악마’로 출력되고 있음을 알 수 있다. 인간의 분열성은 실재계로의, 진정한 윤리로의 지향성으로 열리는 자유의 상처인 것이다.4절에서는 김승옥이 남성과 여성의 라캉적 성...","This paper defined the human nature revealed in Kim Seung-ok’s novel as ‘divisionality’ and attempted to explore. In particular, based on the concept of ‘death impulse’ in Lacan psychoanalysis, the purity of human beings divided through death impulse was derived as the concept of ‘self-world‘. Kim Seung-ok’s ‘self-world’ has been the subject of numerous studies, but its ambiguous character, smell of ‘evil’, and gestures of madness were painted over with new sensitivity. This paper presents the ‘real world’ of Lacan psychoanalysis, especially the ‘life’ of ‘impulse’, as a solution to solve the deadlock of this research. Contrary to the view of some that he is ignoring the times and is only immersed in individualism, this paper aims to suggest that he is faithfully embodying the times of the 1960s and that he can still play the role of an apostle who will convey the truth in the present era beyond the 1960s. This is because he is a revolutionary novelist who tried to give life a beating to helpless postwar literature.To this end, in Section 2, the aspects of death impulse revealed in each work were first traced. Kim Seung-ok’s subjects form a world called the symbolic world through ‘the extreme’ and resistively erupt the pure evil and death impulse as ‘excessive life’. These impulses of life persist in the form of animals and women as a symptom to the symbolic subjects. While abhorring the logic, violence and lies, snobbery of the symbolic world, and loving the cute rabbit and baby goat, the subject immerses himself in a vacuum of division. He bitterly acknowledges that he has no choice but to grow up, the world of others, and points out the nature of human existence that is forced to enter the gap of others like hell. This is not an affirmation that he cannot help but enter the world of snobbery, but Kim Seung-ok’s insight into the ontological nature of humans who are forced to enter the world of others.Section 3 attempted to intensively examine the division of human beings regarding this antinomic position. Kim Seung-ok embodies the life, freedom, love, and revolution of the death impulse that occurs in the space between the gaps of division. The aspects of subjects with the human ‘instinct’ that they must survive while retaining the vitality of the death impulse are actively projected to female characters beyond the symbolic morality of good and evil. Here, the distinction between morality and ethics is important. This is because ethics beyond morality can only be expected from subjects who deeply embody morality toward others. In other words, symbolic morality that does not damage or hurt others is not free from the narcissistic interests and social and passionate interests obtained by being good to others. The characters who have learned the symbolic Sangblanc in this way are rather hypocritical and ideological. However, characters who accept courtesy, consideration, and morality toward others with an ethical attitude of deep ‘love’ are in charge of evil actions aimed at ethics at the moment when morality and ethics conflict. When Lacan is aware that ethics belongs to the real world, it can be seen that Kim Seung-ok’s life is printed as a ‘devil’ who breaks down the unnaturally calm Yangok House. Human division is a wound of freedom that opens up with a direction toward the real world and true ethics.In Section 4, we focused on the part where Kim Seung-ok attempted Hegelian reconciliation by seeing the Lacan gender difference between men and women as a matter of ‘enemy’. This is also referred to as a Buddhist spirit through a conversation with Ha In-sook in “Mujin Travel”. This is because humans who dream of a kingdom that is absent like a Kantian object itself and a mirage but cannot be given up are a ‘life’ that is subordinate to the ‘date’ beyond the gender difference between women and men. This vitality triggers the impulse of love b..."

YOLO v4 모델을 사용하게 된 이유는 이전 YOLO 모델보다 더욱 높은 정확성과 빠른 속도로 개선되어, 객체 탐지 기법이 더 용이해졌기 때문이다. 본 서비스를 AI-Hub 사이트에 등재된 CCTV 영상 데이터로 테스트하는 과정을 거치게 된다. 현재 한국에 CCTV는 기하급수적으로 증가하였고, 이를 실제 CCTV에 적용한다면 앞으로 일어나게 될 군중 밀집으로 인한 사고를 비롯한 다양한 사고를 예방할 수 있을 것으로 기대한다.","In this paper, the purpose of this paper is to predict and prevent the risk of crowd concentration in advance for possible future crowd accidents based on the Itaewon crush accident in Korea on October 29, 2022. In the case of a single CCTV, the administrator can determine the current situation in real time, but since the screen cannot be seen throughout the day, objects are detected using YOLOv4, which learns images taken with CCTV angle, and safety accidents due to crowd concentration are prevented by notification when the number of clusters exceeds. The reason for using the YOLO v4 model is that it improves with higher accuracy and faster speed than the previous YOLO model, making object detection techniques easier. This service will go through the process of testing with CCTV image data registered on the AI-Hub site. Currently, CCTVs have increased exponentially in Korea, and if they are applied to actual CCTVs, it is expected that various accidents, including accidents caused by crowd concentration in the future, can be prevented."
