Echo State Network 모델의 은닉 뉴런 간 연결구조에 따른 성능과 동역학적 특성 분석,2015,"['시계열 데이터', 'Echo State Network', 'Recurrent Neural Network', 'network topology', 'recurrentconnection structure', 'time-series data']","시계열 데이터를 다룰 수 있는 기계학습모델인 회귀 신경망은 되먹임 연결을 허용하기 때문에 앞먹임 신경망에 비해 훨씬 다양한 구조를 가질 수 있다. 본 연구에서는 은닉 뉴런 간의 네트워크 구조에 초점을 맞추어 그것이 회귀 신경망의 정보처리 능력에 미치는 영향을 탐구하고자 한다. 이를 위해 회귀신경망 모델 중 하나인 Echo State Network을 기준으로 하여, 여러 가지 잘 알려진 네트워크 모델에 따라 은닉 뉴런 간 연결을 구성하고 각각의 경우에 시계열 학습 능력과 동역학을 분석하였다. 그 결과, 은닉뉴런의 네트워크 구조에 따라 모델의 성능이 큰 폭으로 변하는 것이 관찰되었으며, 그러한 현상은 신경망 동역학이 가지는 임계도(criticality)의 변화와 잘 일치했다. 본 연구의 결과는 기존 회귀 신경망 연구에서 주된 관심사였던 신경망 연결 가중치뿐만 아니라 신경망의 연결 구조가 모델의 성능에 중요한 영향을 미친다는 사실을 보여주며, 성능 향상을 위한 중요한 단서가 될 수 있다.","Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), a machine learning model which can handle time-series data, can possess more varied structures than a feed-forward neural network, since a RNN allows hidden-to-hidden connections. This research focuses on the network structure among hidden neurons, and discusses the information processing capability of RNN. Time-series learning potential and dynamics of RNNs are investigated upon several well-established network structure models. Hidden neuron network structure is found to have significant impact on the performance of a model, and the performance variations are generally correlated with the criticality of the network dynamics. Especially Preferential Attachment Network model showed an interesting behavior. These findings provide clues for performance improvement of the RNN."
Micellar Packing of Pluronic Block Copolymer Solutions: Polymeric Impurity Effects,2015,"['block copolymers', 'micelles', 'pluronics', 'small angle X-ray scattering']",,"Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and high performance liquidchromatography (HPLC) experiments are performed to support that the inter-micellar distance of Pluronic cubicstructures in aqueous solutions is governed by the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-poly(propylene oxide) (PPO)-PEOtriblock copolymer concentration (not the overall polymer concentration) in the solutions. The “as-received (AR)” and“purified (Pure)” F108 solutions show a separate concentration dependence of body-centered cubic (BCC) latticespacing, when the overall polymer concentration is used as a micellar packing parameter in aqueous solution. When the22 wt% of non-micellizable polymeric impurities in the AR Pluronic F108 is taken into account, however, a universalconcentration dependence of the BCC lattice spacing is observed, unifying results from both AR and Pure F108solutions. When the PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer concentration from the HPLC analysis is employed as aneffective polymer concentration parameter, the universal relationship is observed to provide strong evidence that thepolymeric impurities in AR F108 locate themselves in the less dense parts of the interstitial regions on the BCClattice points, where were occupied by the triblock copolymer micelles. Although the polymeric impurities in ARF108 do not affect the actual triblock concentration dependence of the lattice spacing, they do shift the onsetconcentration of BCC micellar ordering. In the Pure F108, the onset of BCC packing occurs at the point where thenearest-neighbor radius (Rnn) in the BCC lattice is approximately equal to the hydrodynamic radius (Rh), indicatingthat lattice formation begins upon “hydrodynamic contact” between micelles. In the AR F108, the onset of packing occurswhen Rnn/Rh is approximately 0.9, indicating that, in the presence of the polymeric impurities, micelles must be forcedtogether beyond the point of hydrodynamic contact for the BCC packing."
On Positive Semidefinite Preserving Stein Transformation,2015,"['Stein Transformation', 'Semidefinite Linear Complementarity Problems (SDLCP)', '${', 'bf P_2}$-property', '${', ""bf P_2'}$-property"", 'strictly monotone', 'nondegenerate', '${', 'bf GUS}$-property.']",,"In the setting of semidefinite linear complementarity problems on $\sn$,we focus on the Stein Transformation $S_A(X):= X - AXA^T$ for $A\in \Rnn$ that is positive semidefinite preserving (i.e., $S_A(\sn_+) \subseteq \sn_+$) and show that such transformation is strictly monotone if and only if it is  nondegenerate.   We also show that a positive semidefinite preserving $S_A$ has the Ultra-GUS property if and only if $1 \not\in \sigma(A)\sigma(A).$"
순환 신경망을 이용한 보행단계 분류기,2015,"['recurrent neural network', 'gait phase classifier', 'artificial neural network']",,"This paper proposes a gait phase classifier using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Walking is a type of dynamic system, and as such it seems that the classifier made by using a general feed forward neural network structure is not appropriate. It is known that an RNN is suitable to model a dynamic system. Because the proposed RNN is simple, we use a back propagation algorithm to train the weights of the network. The input data of the RNN is the lower body’s joint angles and angular velocities which are acquired by using the lower limb exoskeleton robot, ROBIN-H1. The classifier categorizes a gait cycle as two phases, swing and stance. In the experiment for performance verification, we compared the proposed method and general feed forward neural network based method and showed that the proposed method is superior."

In general, productivity prediction is made using the decline curve analysis(DCA). In this study, we intend to propose an effective model for predicting future production using deep learning-based recurrent neural networks(RNN). LSTM, and GRU algorithms. As input variables, the main parameters are oil, gas, water, which are calculated during the production of tight oil, and the type curve calculated through various cluster analyzes. the output variable is the monthly oil production. Existing empirical models, the DCA and RNN models, were compared, and an optimal model was derived through hyperparameter tuning to improve the predictive performance of the model."
A Hybrid Under-sampling Approach for Better Bankruptcy Prediction,2015,"['Bankruptcy Prediction', 'Under-sampling', 'k-Reverse Nearest Neighbor', 'One-class Support Vector Machine', 'Classification', '부도예측', '언더샘플링', 'k-Reverse Nearest Neighbor', 'One-class Support Vector Machine', '분류']",,"The purpose of this study is to improve bankruptcy prediction models by using a novel hybrid under-sampling approach. Most prior studies have tried to enhance the accuracy of bankruptcy prediction models by improving the classification methods involved. In contrast, we focus on appropriate data preprocessing as a means of enhancing accuracy. In particular, we aim to develop an effective sampling approach for bankruptcy prediction, since most prediction models suffer from class imbalance problems. The approach proposed in this study is a hybrid under-sampling method that combines the k-Reverse Nearest Neighbor (k-RNN) and one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) approaches. k-RNN can effectively eliminate outliers, while OCSVM contributes to the selection of informative training samples from majority class data. To validate our proposed approach, we have applied it to data from H Bank’s non-external auditing companies in Korea, and compared the performances of the classifiers with the proposed under-sampling and random sampling data. The empirical results show that the proposed under-sampling approach generally improves the accuracy of classifiers, such as logistic regression, discriminant analysis, decision tree, and support vector machines. They also show that the proposed under-sampling approach reduces the risk of false negative errors, which lead to higher misclassification costs."
