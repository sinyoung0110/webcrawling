문자 깨짐 방지를 위한 서버 상에서의 인코딩 자동인식 적용 방법,2015,"['server-side encoding', 'auto encoding detection', 'mojibake', 'FEAD', 'iconv', 'unicode', 'utf8', 'broken hangul']",,"Web browsers are user selected servers that display information based responses relating to questions asked by the users. However on rare occasions, multi-byte characters which are on encoding auto detect features, can result in a malfunction of the response data, resulting in characters breakage. In this paper, we will reveal the cause of these malfunctions that occur on the client character workarounds. To further understand what causes these cracks, one must understand the purpose of FEAD(Fast Encoding Auto Detector). FEAD has the function to automatically change operations from a server to script to automatically recognize the type of data, and encoding this data to be transmitted, and resolved. This method is available on web page, strings, file name and documents."
