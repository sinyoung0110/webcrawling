Partial Discharge Localization Based on Detailed Models of Transformer and Wavelet Transform Techniques,2015,"['Wavelet transform', 'Power transformer', 'RLC model', 'Multi-conductor transmission line(MTL)', 'Partial discharge', 'PD localization']",,"Partial Discharge (PD) is a physical phenomenon, which causes defects and damages to the insulation. This phenomenon is regarded as the most important source of fault and defect in power transformers. Therefore, methods of high speed and precision are considered of special importance for the maintenance of transformers in localization of the origin of partial discharge. In this paper, the transformer winding is first modeled in a transient state by using RLC ladder network and multiconductor transmission line (MTL) models. The parameters of the two models were calculated by Ansoft Maxwell software, and the simulations were performed by Matlab software. Then, the PD pulses were applied to the models with different widths of pulses. With regard to the fact that the signals received after the application of PD had a variable frequency nature over time, and based on the wavelet transform and signal energy, a new method was presented for the localization of PD. Ultimately; the mentioned method was implemented on a 20 kV winding distribution transformer. Then, the performances of the models used in this paper, including RLC and MTL models, were compared in different frequency bands for the correct distinction of partial discharge location."

Exergy Analysis of Various Absorption Heat Transformer Systems Using Classical and Modi¯ed Gouy–Stodola Equation,2015,"['Various absorption heat transformer systems', 'hot °uid produced', 'classical and modi ¯ed Gouy–Stodola equation.']",,"In the present study, performance evaluation of three di®erent con¯gurations of absorption heattransformer (AHT) is carried out by supplying the waste heat of same mass and same temperature;and exergy analysis is done using both the classical and modi¯ed Gouy–stodola equation.For this a mathematical model is developed for all the three arrangements in EngineeringEquation Solver. Water–lithium bromide is used as a working pair. The results of exergy destructionwith classical and modi¯ed Gouy–stodola equation are compared for di®erent systems.Further various operating parameters are varied to predict the performance of the systems on thebasis of second law analysis. The result showed that the amount of hot °uid produced in absorberis more for system 3 as compared to other con¯gurations. The irreversibility calculated by themodi¯ed approach comes out to be 25.78%, 23.60%, and 23.45% more than the exergy destructionobtained by the classical approach in the three cases, respectively. Thus, there is a need to employthe modi¯ed approach of Gouy–Stodola equation for calculating the real irreversibility whichhelps in predicting the scope of improvement and the performance of the system more accurately"

Multi-point displacement monitoring of bridges using a vision-based approach,2015,"['structural health monitoring', 'dynamic displacement', 'vision-based system', 'digital image processing technique', 'pattern matching algorithm']",,"To overcome the drawbacks of the traditional contact-type sensor for structural displacementmeasurement, the vision-based technology with the aid of the digital image processing algorithm hasreceived increasing concerns from the community of structural health monitoring (SHM). The advancedvision-based system has been widely used to measure the structural displacement of civil engineeringstructures due to its overwhelming merits of non-contact, long-distance, and high-resolution. However,seldom currently-available vision-based systems are capable of realizing the synchronous structuraldisplacement measurement for multiple points on the investigated structure. In this paper, the method forvision-based multi-point structural displacement measurement is presented. A series of moving loadingexperiments on a scale arch bridge model are carried out to validate the accuracy and reliability of thevision-based system for multi-point structural displacement measurement. The structural displacements offive points on the bridge deck are measured by the vision-based system and compared with those obtainedby the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The comparative study demonstrates that thevision-based system is deemed to be an effective and reliable means for multi-point structural displacementmeasurement."
DEA를 활용한 포워딩 업체의 효율성분석에 관한 연구,2015,"['포워딩업체', '운영효율성', 'forwarding company', 'SBM-DEA', 'operational efficiency', 'DEA-CCR', 'DEA-BCC']","최근 포워딩업체는 글로벌 금융위기에 따른 전체적인 수요감소, 외국계 물류기업의 선전 등으로 어려움을 겪고 있다. 이에 본 연구는 DEA모형을 이용하여 국내 상위 15개 포워딩 업체들의 2009~2014년까지 5년간 경영효율성 분석을 통해 운영효율성을 증대시키기 위한 시사점 제공을 목적으로 하였다. 투입변수로 종업원수, 자본금, 영업외비용, 산출변수로 매출액, 영업이익을 활용하였다. 분석결과 삼성전자로지텍, 협진해운, 효성트랜스, 3개 업체가 CCR, BCC, 규모 효율성 모두 1로 나타났다. SBM-DEA모형을 통해 투입요소의 비효율성을 측정한 결과, 전반적으로 종업원수를 약 30%, 자본을 36%, 영업외비용을 19%정도 감소시켜야 비효율성을 개선할 수 있는 것으로 나타났다. 종업원 운영능력이 매출에 크게 영향을 미치는 포워딩 업체에서는 효과적인 인적자원 관리가 필요하며, 영업외비용측면에서 효율적인 미수금 관리 및 외환 차손 관리가 필요하다.","An analysis of the efficiency of 15 forwarding companies, including Samsung Electronics Logitech, Hyupjin Shipping, and Hyosung Transformers, was conducted based on data from 2009 to 2014. These companies were assessed in terms of CCR, BCC, and scale efficiency, and were found to be operating under an appropriately efficient scale. This study aims to determine the operating conditions by analyzing the effectiveness of existing domestic forwarding companies, which has not been studied before, and provide suggestions for improving the operational efficiency of forwarding companies in Korea. The average efficiency in terms of CCR for the year 2014 was found to be 0.75, which is a low level that indicates over-commitment and inefficiency. The operating expenses and employee capital generation in operational terms exhibited inefficiencies attributable to scale, which had a value of 0.86. The analysis showed that the top three manufacturers need to reduce RTS size in accordance with DRS, which is a sub-group of six companies. Moreover, the operational efficiency of all forwarding companies should be improved and expanded to achieve the appropriate scale according to the IRS. In addition, the SBM-DEA model was applied to the top 15 forwarding companies to measure the inefficiency of inputs in 2014, based on capital, overall number of employees, and operating expense, which require reductions of 30%, 36%, and 19%, respectively. Such reductions are apparently capable of improving the current inefficiency. Forwarding companies operating in the employee’s ability to significantly influence operating revenue inefficiency requires effective management of human resources identified areas, and in terms of non-operating expenses were also able to verify the effective accounts receivable management and foreign currency transactions management is required. As this study considered the sales of only the top 15 companies, the operational efficiency of small and medium-sized forwarding companies was not analyzed. Moreover, the network of partnerships and the agency contracts on which the sales are based were not considered. In the future, variables such as employee careers, cargo throughput, number of network transactions, and number of large customers, which reflect the characteristics of forwarding companies, should be examined. Additional research should also be conducted to account for the factors influencing the establishment of long-term contracts. In addition, we need to grasp each enterprise``s internal management capabilities and additional variables that affect the management efficiency and are in need of systematic and practical research."
Evaluation of Internally Cured Concrete Pavement Using Environmental Responses and Critical Stress Analysis,2015,"['internally cured concrete slab', 'rigid pavements', 'full-scale HVS testing', 'stress analysis', 'pavement instrumentation', 'finite element analysis']",,"Three full-scale instrumented test slabs were constructed and tested using a heavy vehicle simulator (HVS) to evaluate the structural behavior of internally cured concrete (ICC) for use in pavements under Florida condition. Three mix designs selected from a previous laboratory testing program include the standard mixture with 0.40 water-cement ratio, the ICC with 0.32 water-cement ratio, and the ICC mixture with 0.40 water-cement ratio. Concrete samples were prepared and laboratory tests were performed to measure strength, elastic modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion and shrinkage properties. The environmental responses were measured using strain gages, thermocouples, and linear variable differential transformers instrumented in full-scale concrete slabs. A 3-D finite element model was developed and calibrated using strain data measured from the full-scale tests using the HVS. The results indicate that the ICC slabs were less susceptible to the change of environmental conditions and appear to have better potential performance based on the critical stress analysis."
