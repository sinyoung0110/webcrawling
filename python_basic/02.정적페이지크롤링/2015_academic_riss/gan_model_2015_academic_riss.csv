Leakage Current Analysis of GaN-Based Light-Emitting Diodes Using a Parasitic Diode Model,2015,"['parasitic diode', 'Hydrogen (H)-related deep-level states', 'leakage current', 'light-emitting diode (LED)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The leakage current of GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) was analyzed with a parasitic diode model. Arrhenius plots of forward leakage currents revealed that the threshold voltages of the main diode and the parasitic diode were 2.64 and 0.94 V, respectively. The parasitic diode, however, led to an insignificant change in the reverse leakage mechanism, e.g., a predominant reverse leakage mechanism was Poole-Frenkel conduction in the high-temperature range (>300 K) and the variable range hopping in the low-temperature range (<;300 K), as reported previously. The origin of the parasitic diode could be due to the incorporated hydrogen (H) atoms into the top LEDs layers, presumably enhancing the defect-assisted tunneling through the generated H-related deep-level states, particularly generated in the p-cladding or p-AlGaN electron blocking layer.</P>"
EMI Modeling and Experiment of a GaN Based LLC Half-Bridge Converter,2015,"['DC-DC converter', 'GaN Mosfet', 'EMI', 'layout']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper focuses on the electromagnetic interference (EMI) research and analysis of the MHz switching frequency GaN MOSFET based on the LLC resonant DC-DC converter. In this paper, first, the CM coupling paths are studied to get simplified models. Then the impact of the parasitic capacitors (both the capacitors to the ground and the capacitors in the devices) on the CM current are analyzed. Finally the high frequency model is derived from the work above. Moreover this paper makes the comparison between normal Si MOSFET and GaNbased MOSFET behavior in EMI. The modeling result proves that GaN MOSFET has a worse behavior on EMI test. An experiment layout which is aimed at minimizing the irrelevant factors is designed and the experiment result proves the accuracy of the modeling."
Optimal Utilization of Low Voltage GaN HEMT in High Frequency Boost Converter,2015,"['Boost Converter', 'GaN HEMT', 'High Frequency', 'PFC']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, investigations on optimal topology and operation mode for low voltage GaN HEMT are performed. Analytical loss model of GaN HEMT, in which influences of circuit and package parasitics are accounted for, is developed as a tool to analyze losses in GaN HEMT in different switching conditions. Analysis results shows that when applied in both Vout〈2Vin and Vout〉2Vin situations in Boundary Conduction Mode with Valley Switching(BCM-VS) in a boost converter, where GaN HEMT is switched on when voltage across it is lowered, switching loss can be greatly reduced. Switching loss reduction results not only from the exemption of discharging the large output capacitance of GaN HEMT at high voltage, but also from the fact that parasitic inductance has much less effects on switching loss in GaN HEMT in BCM-VS than in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM). Limitations and design tradeoffs when GaN HEMT is applied in BCM-VS are also revealed. Forward voltage of GaN HEMT in reverse conduction is high and its conduction should be prevented when Vout〉 to achieve conduction loss reduction. This further loss reduction can be realized by switching on transistor before valley point. Besides, in BCM-VS, overvoltage on GaN HEMT is larger and oscillatory energy dissipation in circuit is higher than in CCM due to higher turn off current. Paralleling external capacitor to the transistor helps to ease voltage stress; however turn on loss will be increased. This loss increase is more severe in the case of Vout〈2Vin than Vout〉2Vin. Trade-offs on the selection of proper external capacitor value exists between increased switching loss and reduced voltage stress. Experimental setup is built to verify and demonstrate the analysis."
"Fabrication, Structure and Hydrogen-gas-sensing Properties of Multiple Networked GaN Nanostructure Gas Sensors",2015,"['GaN', 'Nanostructure', 'Gas sensor', 'Hydrogen']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The controlled synthesis of nanostructures with different shapes and morphologies has attractedconsiderable interest because the sensing properties of nanostructures depend on their structure,shape, phase, size, and size distribution, as well as their composition. This paper compares theresponses of GaN nanostructures with different morphologies to hydrogen. The underlying mechanismfor the hydrogen gas sensing of the multiple networked GaN nanowire sensor can be explainedbased on the well-established surface depletion model. On the other hand, the difference betweentwo different samples, the GaN nanostructure sample synthesized at 1,100◦C and that synthesizedat 1,000◦C, could be explained as follows: The major process behind the interaction between thenanostructures and hydrogen is the chemisorption of the dissociated hydrogen on the GaN surface.The chemisorption creates an electron accumulation layer on the GaN surface that enhances itselectrical conductance. The GaN nanostructure sample synthesized at 1,100◦C with a higher ammoniaflow rate showed a higher response to H2 gas than that synthesized at 1,000◦C with a lowerammonia flow rate, which might be attributed to the higher surface-to-volume ratio of the former."
Semantic Annotation of Ontology by Using Rough Concept Lattice Isomorphic Model,2015,"['Rough concept lattice', 'Ontology mapping', 'Ontology merging', 'Semantic annotation', 'Isomorphic model']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Semantic annotation is the process based on ontology annotation concept class, attribute and other metadata for cyber source and its various parts. Ontology mapping is to calculate the similarity between two ontology elements. Ontology merging is two or more source ontology merging into a goal Ontology. The basic principle of the concept lattice isomorphic generating is isomorphic to the background of the isomorphic concept lattice, and as concept lattice isomorphic background can generate the concept lattice. This paper analyzes the methods of ontology mapping and merging based on rough concept lattice isomorphic model and presents semantic annotation of ontology by using rough concept lattice isomorphic model. Experiments show that this method is better than the traditional method in semantic annotation accuracy and breadth."
Design of near-unity transmittance dielectric/Ag/ITO electrodes for GaN-based light-emitting diodes,2015,"['Interference coatings', 'Thin films', 'Metal optics', 'Transparent conducting electrode']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We designed a near-unity transmittance dielectric/Ag/ITO electrode for high-efficiency GaN-based lightemitting diodes by using the scattering matrix method. The transmittance of an ultrathin metal layer, sandwiched between a dielectric layer and an ITO layer, was investigated as a function of the thickness and the optical constant of each constituent layer. Three different metals (Ag, Au, and Al) were examined as the metal layer. The analytical simulation indicated that the transmittance of a dielectric/metal/ITO multilayer film is maximized with an approximately 10-nm-thick Ag layer. Additionally, the transmittance also tends to increase as the refractive index of the upper dielectric layer increases. By tailoring the thickness of the dielectric layer and the ITO layer, the dielectric/Ag/ITO structure yielded a transmittance of 0.97, which surpasses the maximum transmittance (0.91) of a single ITO film. Furthermore, this extraordinary transmittance was present for other visible wavelengths of light, including violet and green colors. A complex phasor diagram model confirmed that the transmittance of the dielectric/metal/ ITO multilayer film is influenced by the interference of reflected partial waves. These numerical findings underpin a rational design principle for metal-based multilayer films that are utilized as transparent electrodes for the development of efficient light-emitting diodes and solar cell devices."

GaN FET를 적용한 인터리브 CRM PFC의 효율특성에 관한 연구,2015,"['GaN FET', 'CRM(Critical Current Mode)', 'PFC(Power Factor Correction)', 'High efficiency', 'SiC FET']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper presents the efficiency analysis of a critical current mode interleaved PFC rectifier, in which each of three different semiconductor switches is employed as the active switch. The Si FET, SiC FET, and GaN FET are consecutively used with the prototype PFC rectifier, and the efficiency of the PFC rectifier with each different semiconductor switch is analyzed. An equivalent circuit model of the PFC rectifier, which incorporates all the internal losses of the PFC rectifier, is developed. The rms values of the current waveforms main circuit components are calculated. By adapting the rms current waveforms to the equivalent model, all the losses are broken down and individually analyzed to assess the conduction loss, switching loss, and magnetic loss in the PFC rectifier. This study revealed that the GaN FET offers the highest overall efficiency with the least loss among the three switching devices. The GaN FET yields 96% efficiency at 90 V input and 97.6% efficiency at 240 V, under full load condition. This paper also confirmed that the efficiency of the three switching devices largely depends on the turn-on resistance and parasitic capacitance of the respective switching devices."
Impact of a Drain Field Plate on the Breakdown Characteristics of AlInN/GaN MOSHEMT,2015,"['MOSHEMT', 'AlInN/GaN', 'Passivation', 'Breakdown voltage', 'Drain field plate']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, a novel AlInN/GaN metal oxide semiconductor high electron mobility transistor (MOSHEMT) employing the drain field plate technique is proposed and the effect of a drain field plate on the breakdown voltage (BV) is investigated. A reduction of the peak electric field is required to achieve AlInN/GaN MOSHEMTs with a high BV. The proposed AlInN/GaN MOSHEMT with both gate and drain field plates simultaneously reduces the electric field concentration at the gate and the drain edge by decreasing the potential gradient along the channel for the 2 dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The reduction in the peak electric field at the drain edge of the proposed device leads to a 57% increase in BV compared with the BV for an AlInN/GaN MOSHEMT with a gate field plate only. A significantly higher BV can be achieved by optimizing the gate-to-drain distance (Lgd), the length of the drain field plate (Ldfp) and the thickness of the SiN passivation layer thickness (TSiN). A detailed breakdown analysis of the device was carried out using Silvaco Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD). The detailed numerical simulations were done by using the non-local energy balance (EB) transport model, which was calibrated with the previously published experimental results. The results showed a great potential for applications of the drain-field-plated AlInN/GaN MOSHEMT to deliver high currents and high powers in microwave technologies."

A double pulse tester was designed to experimentally verify the simulation results.

The analysis of the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics demonstrated different mechanisms involved in the current charge transport in the LED device. Experimental admittance spectra have been investigated in broad frequency range, at various temperature and different direct current biases. A specific extraction of the quantum well conductance, based on Nicollian and Goetzberger’s model related to interface state conductance in Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor structure, has shown the effect of the quantum structure on the electric transport, and hence a correlation between the I-V electrical characteristics and the admittance spectroscopy has revealed the different conduction mechanisms involved in the charge transport in the InGaN/GaN LED. Activation energies and carrier capture velocity obtained from Arrhenius plots, determined from the thermally activated quantum well conductance peaks which are revealed with the used model, have confirmed that quantum well parameters are related to the carrier emission from confined levels in quantum wells."

Investigation of Fermi level pinning at semipolar (11-22) p-type GaN surfaces,2015,"['Schottky contacts', 'Semipolar GaN', 'Barrier inhomogeneity model', 'Surface states']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Schottky barrier height (SBH; Φ<SUB>B</SUB>) and their dependence on the work function of metals (Φ<SUB>M</SUB>) at semipolar (11-22) p-GaN surfaces were investigated using Schottky diodes fabricated with different metals. The SBH increased with temperature, whereas the ideality factor decreased. This behavior was explained by means of the barrier inhomogeneity model, giving the mean barrier heights of 1.93-2.05eV for different metals. The S-parameter (dΦ<SUB>B</SUB>/dΦ<SUB>M</SUB>) was obtained to be 0.04. This small S-parameter implies that the surface Fermi level is nearly perfectly pinned at deep-level states (caused by vacancy-related and/or Mg-induced defects) located at 1.98eV above the valence band. This finding indicates that the surface modification is essentially required for the formation of high-quality ohmic and/or Schottky contacts."

The present study attempted to explore the protective properties of L. rhamnosus CCFM1107 in alcoholic liver injury. A mouse model was induced by orally feeding alcohol when simultaneously treated with L. rhamnosus CCFM1107, the drug Hu-Gan- Pian (HGP), L. rhamnosus GG (LGG), and L. plantarum CCFM1112 for 3 months. Biochemical analysis was performed for both serum and liver homogenate. Detailed intestinal flora and histological analyses were also carried out. Our results indicated that the administration of L. rhamnosus CCFM1107 significantly inhibited the increase in the levels of serum aminotransferase and endotoxin, as well as the levels of triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (CHO) in the serum and in the liver. Glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were elevated while the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were decreased. The enteric dysbiosis caused by alcohol was restored by increasing the numbers of both lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and decreasing the numbers of both enterococci and enterobacter. Histological analysis confirmed the protective effect of L. rhamnosus CCFM1107. Compared with the other lactobacilli and to the drug Hu-Gan-Pian, there is a high chance that L. rhamnosus CCFM1107 provides protective effects on alcoholic liver injury by reducing oxidative stress and restoring the intestinal flora."

The ternary alloys have been grown with identical growth-front roughness as confirmed by XRR and RHEED observations. The spottier RHEED has been observed with increased thickness of the InGaN as opposed to streakier behavior of AlGaN. We have noticed incremental nature of RMS roughness, skewness and kurtosis of InGaN surface compared to GaN or AlGaN from AFM as evident by final spotty RHEED for InGaN. However, the analyzed fractal dimension is lower for InGaN as opposed to AlGaN ( ). From the kinetic roughening perspective of adatoms, the experimental evidences lead to the high correlation between binding energy of the cluster atoms ( ) and the modified DDA growth model with dissociation and evaporation to confirm the efficacy of the study. The initial streaky and spotty RHEED of InGaN and AlGaN, respectively, can be attributed to their Eb that causes smoothing and roughening of the GaN surface due to adatoms surface mobility behavior. Therefore, the fractal description reveals the fact during formation of nitride hetero-interface while other AFM results describe the top surface."
Screening of toxic potential of graphene family nanomaterials using in vitro and alternative in vivo toxicity testing systems,2015,"['Alternative toxicity testing', 'Human bronchial epithelial cells', 'Caenorhabditis ele￢gans', 'Graphene family nanomaterials']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objectives: The widely promising applications of graphene nanomaterials raise considerable concerns regarding their environmental and human health risk assessment. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the toxicity profiling of graphene family nananomaterials (GFNs) in alternative in vitro and in vivo toxicity testing models.  Methods: The GFNs used in this study are graphene nanoplatelets ([GNPs]–pristine, carboxylate [COOH] and amide [NH2]) and graphene oxides (single layer [SLGO] and few layers [FLGO]). The human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas2B cells) as in vitro system and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as in vivo system were used to profile the toxicity response of GFNs. Cytotoxicity assays, colony formation assay for cellular toxicity and reproduction potentiality in C. elegans were used as end points to evaluate the GFNs’ toxicity.  Results: In general, GNPs exhibited higher toxicity than GOs in Beas2B cells, and among the GNPs the order of toxicity was pristine>NH2>COOH. Although the order of toxicity of the GNPs was maintained in C. elegans reproductive toxicity, but GOs were found to be more toxic in the worms than GNPs. In both systems, SLGO exhibited profoundly greater dose dependency than FLGO. The possible reason of their differential toxicity lay in their distinctive physicochemical characteristics and agglomeration behavior in the exposure media.  Conclusions: The present study revealed that the toxicity of GFNs is dependent on the graphene nanomaterial’s physical forms, surface functionalizations, number of layers, dose, time of exposure and obviously, on the alternative model systems used for toxicity assessment."

A new larger Markov network is formed with more and richer relationship for each term. Evaluation is performed on three standard information retrieval corpuses including ADI, CISI and CACM.Experimental results show that the proposed technique of superimposed Markov network is effective to select more and confident candidatesfor query expansion and it outperforms other state-of-the-art QE methods."

Depression and the Risk of Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies,2015,"['Depression', 'breast cancer', 'meta-analysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: Whether depression causes increased risk of the development of breast cancer has long been debated. We conducted an updated meta-analysis of cohort studies to assess the association between depression and risk of breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Relevant literature was searched from Medline, Embase, Web of Science (up to April 2014) as well as manual searches of reference lists of selected publications. Cohort studies on the association between depression and breast cancer were included. Data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two authors. Random-effect model was used to compute the pooled risk estimate. Visual inspection of a funnel plot, Begg rank correlation test and Egger linear regression test were used to evaluate the publication bias. Results: We identified eleven cohort studies (182,241 participants, 2,353 cases) with a follow-up duration ranging from 5 to 38 years. The pooled adjusted RR was 1.13(95% CI: 0.94 to 1.36; $I^2=67.2%$, p=0.001). The association between the risk of breast cancer and depression was consistent across subgroups. Visual inspection of funnel plot and Begg's and Egger's tests indicated no evidence of publication bias. Regarding limitations, a one-time assessment of depression with no measure of duration weakens the test of hypothesis. In addition, 8 different scales were used for the measurement of depression, potentially adding to the multiple conceptual problems concerned with the definition of depression. Conclusions: Available epidemiological evidence is insufficient to support a positive association between depression and breast cancer."

In addition, he made his efforts to learn the original forms of the public documents used at the age. Jo, Kyoung’s favorite was Chuang-tzu(莊子) and he cited Chuang-tzu in many of his notes. Recently, it is generally accepted that Jo, Kyoung’s philosophy and writing were largely influenced by Chuang-tzu.In a number of previous works, it was mentioned that Jo, Kyoung was recommended to learn Records of the historian(史記) by Youn, Kun-su. In this study, we demonstrate that it was not just a single event of studying Records of the historian, but Jo, Kyoung continued to investigate Records of the historian for his entire life.Jo, Kyoung highly estimated the value of Wang, Shi-zhen(王世貞)’s philosophy and articles, which was an extraordinary point of view to him at the age because Wang, Shi-zhen was criticized to copy phrases from other’s articles to his publications and prefer Ko-hak(古學) than Jung-Ju-Hak(程朱學). Jo, Kyoung, however, strongly agreed to Wang, Shi-zhen’s theories of literature study, loved to read his literatures, and recommended them to others. The impact of Jo, Kyoung’s recognition and admiring to Wang, Shi-zhen was intensive enough to turn over the methodology of literature studies at the time: review and realizations of Ko-ki(古氣).The methodology Jo, Kyoung took for the investigation in Wang, Shi-zhen’s publications was to read Ko-mun(古文) exhaustively until the readers can feel the thinkings and hearts of the author deeply. Jo, Kyoung worked this way in his entire life.It is quite surprising that Jo, Kyoung left no independent critic notes in his life because he did many of criticisms in wide range of Chinese literature. From Jo, Kyoung’s criticisms, we can deduce not only what he took importantly in literatures but also how he tried to establish the methodology of ‘learning and creating’ literatures, in detail. In this work, we review Jo, Kyoung’s methodology and aims for studying paragon literatures and his realistic literature criticism."

21세기 중국 정치유학의 이념과 쟁점,2015,"['정치유학', '심성유학', '제도', '대륙신유가', '대만신유가', '신문화운동', 'Political Confucianism', 'Mind Confucianism', 'Institution', 'Neo-Confucianism in Continent', 'Neo-Confucianism in Taiwan', 'New Culture Movement']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In the times of ‘The rise of China’, ‘Political Confucianism’ has raised as the new Ideal type for reinforcing the influence of Confucian values. Through persisting Political Confucianism, Chinese Neo-confucianists intend to construct the unique political model of China, beyond the scientific innovation. Jiang Qing(蔣慶), Yao Zhongqiu(姚中秋), Gan Chunsong(干春松), the representative exponents of Political Confucianism, criticize that Neo-confucianism, producted by Taiwan Neo-confucianists, do not concern the reality of China, just concentrates on the academic research, so call them ‘Mind Confucianism’, ‘the exhibit of museum’, ‘the history of philosophy’, ‘Ideal history’. Their alternative type to existing Confucianism, proposed by them, is so called ‘Political Confucianism’, ‘People’s Confucianism’, ‘Institutional Confucianism’. Their argument is connected to the idea of searching for Chinese model in the times of ‘The rise of China’. Neo-Confucianists in Chinese continent orient their Confucianism as the idea to overcome Western modernity and have difference to the Neo-Confucianism in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In January of 2015 Li Minghuei(李明輝), the successor of Neo-Confucianism in Taiwan, criticized the argument of Political Confucianism. His criticism cause the debate between the Confucianists of Chinese continent and Taiwan. Their debate revealed the difference of the view on the Neo-Confucianism and social context of both sides. Furthermore it is relevant to the view on modern Western political theories, Chinese modern history since New Culture Movement, based on pursuing Western modernity. The main point in criticizing Li Minghuei is that Li cannot understand the situation of China, insist that their Confucianism is the result of dealing with the Chinese situation. The hole process of argument and debates on Political Confucianism reveal that Chinese Confucianism have continued to develop, through searching for reinforcing its influence on Chinese reality."
Investigation of wind-induced dynamic and aeroelastic effects on variable message signs,2015,"['aerodynamic drag', 'galloping', 'variable message sign', 'vortex shedding']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Tests were conducted at the Florida International University (FIU) Wall of Wind (WOW) to investigate the susceptibility of Variable Message Signs (VMS) to wind induced vibrations due to vortex shedding and galloping instability. Large scale VMS models were tested in turbulence representative of the high frequency end of the spectrum in a simulated suburban atmospheric boundary layer. Data was measured for the $0^{\circ}$ and $45^{\circ}$ horizontal wind approach directions and vertical attack angles ranging from $-4.5^{\circ}$ to $+4.5^{\circ}$. Analysis of the power spectrum of the fluctuating lift indicated that vertical vortex oscillations could be significant for VMS with a large depth ratio attached to a structure with a low natural frequency. Analysis of the galloping test data indicated that VMS with large depth ratios, greater than about 0.5, and low natural frequency could also be subject to galloping instability."
