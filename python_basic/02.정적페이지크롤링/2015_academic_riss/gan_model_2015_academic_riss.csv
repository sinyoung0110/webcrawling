"Fabrication, Structure and Hydrogen-gas-sensing Properties of Multiple Networked GaN Nanostructure Gas Sensors",2015,"['GaN', 'Nanostructure', 'Gas sensor', 'Hydrogen']",,"The controlled synthesis of nanostructures with different shapes and morphologies has attractedconsiderable interest because the sensing properties of nanostructures depend on their structure,shape, phase, size, and size distribution, as well as their composition. This paper compares theresponses of GaN nanostructures with different morphologies to hydrogen. The underlying mechanismfor the hydrogen gas sensing of the multiple networked GaN nanowire sensor can be explainedbased on the well-established surface depletion model. On the other hand, the difference betweentwo different samples, the GaN nanostructure sample synthesized at 1,100◦C and that synthesizedat 1,000◦C, could be explained as follows: The major process behind the interaction between thenanostructures and hydrogen is the chemisorption of the dissociated hydrogen on the GaN surface.The chemisorption creates an electron accumulation layer on the GaN surface that enhances itselectrical conductance. The GaN nanostructure sample synthesized at 1,100◦C with a higher ammoniaflow rate showed a higher response to H2 gas than that synthesized at 1,000◦C with a lowerammonia flow rate, which might be attributed to the higher surface-to-volume ratio of the former."
Design of near-unity transmittance dielectric/Ag/ITO electrodes for GaN-based light-emitting diodes,2015,"['Interference coatings', 'Thin films', 'Metal optics', 'Transparent conducting electrode']",,"We designed a near-unity transmittance dielectric/Ag/ITO electrode for high-efficiency GaN-based light-emitting diodes by using the scattering matrix method. The transmittance of an ultrathin metal layer, sandwiched between a dielectric layer and an ITO layer, was investigated as a function of the thickness and the optical constant of each constituent layer. Three different metals (Ag, Au, and Al) were examined as the metal layer. The analytical simulation indicated that the transmittance of a dielectric/metal/ITO multilayer film is maximized with an approximately 10-nm-thick Ag layer. Additionally, the transmittance also tends to increase as the refractive index of the upper dielectric layer increases. By tailoring the thickness of the dielectric layer and the ITO layer, the dielectric/Ag/ITO structure yielded a transmittance of 0.97, which surpasses the maximum transmittance (0.91) of a single ITO film. Furthermore, this extraordinary transmittance was present for other visible wavelengths of light, including violet and green colors. A complex phasor diagram model confirmed that the transmittance of the dielectric/metal/ITO multilayer film is influenced by the interference of reflected partial waves. These numerical findings underpin a rational design principle for metal-based multilayer films that are utilized as transparent electrodes for the development of efficient light-emitting diodes and solar cell devices."

GaN FET를 적용한 인터리브 CRM PFC의 효율특성에 관한 연구,2015,"['GaN FET', 'CRM(Critical Current Mode)', 'PFC(Power Factor Correction)', 'High efficiency', 'SiC FET']",,"This paper presents the efficiency analysis of a critical current mode interleaved PFC rectifier, in which each of three different semiconductor switches is employed as the active switch. The Si FET, SiC FET, and GaN FET are consecutively used with the prototype PFC rectifier, and the efficiency of the PFC rectifier with each different semiconductor switch is analyzed. An equivalent circuit model of the PFC rectifier, which incorporates all the internal losses of the PFC rectifier, is developed. The rms values of the current waveforms main circuit components are calculated. By adapting the rms current waveforms to the equivalent model, all the losses are broken down and individually analyzed to assess the conduction loss, switching loss, and magnetic loss in the PFC rectifier. This study revealed that the GaN FET offers the highest overall efficiency with the least loss among the three switching devices. The GaN FET yields 96% efficiency at 90 V input and 97.6% efficiency at 240 V, under full load condition. This paper also confirmed that the efficiency of the three switching devices largely depends on the turn-on resistance and parasitic capacitance of the respective switching devices."
Impact of a Drain Field Plate on the Breakdown Characteristics of AlInN/GaN MOSHEMT,2015,"['MOSHEMT', 'AlInN/GaN', 'Passivation', 'Breakdown voltage', 'Drain field plate']",,"In this paper, a novel AlInN/GaN metal oxide semiconductor high electron mobility transistor (MOSHEMT) employing the drain field plate technique is proposed and the effect of a drain field plate on the breakdown voltage (BV) is investigated. A reduction of the peak electric field is required to achieve AlInN/GaN MOSHEMTs with a high BV. The proposed AlInN/GaN MOSHEMT with both gate and drain field plates simultaneously reduces the electric field concentration at the gate and the drain edge by decreasing the potential gradient along the channel for the 2 dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The reduction in the peak electric field at the drain edge of the proposed device leads to a 57% increase in BV compared with the BV for an AlInN/GaN MOSHEMT with a gate field plate only. A significantly higher BV can be achieved by optimizing the gate-to-drain distance (Lgd), the length of the drain field plate (Ldfp) and the thickness of the SiN passivation layer thickness (TSiN). A detailed breakdown analysis of the device was carried out using Silvaco Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD). The detailed numerical simulations were done by using the non-local energy balance (EB) transport model, which was calibrated with the previously published experimental results. The results showed a great potential for applications of the drain-field-plated AlInN/GaN MOSHEMT to deliver high currents and high powers in microwave technologies."
SPIRAL WAVE GENERATION IN A DIFFUSIVE PREDATOR-PREY MODEL WITH TWO TIME DELAYS,2015,"['time delay', 'spiral wave', 'spatial pattern', 'Hopf bifurcation']",,"This paper is concerned with the pattern formation of a diffusive predator-prey model with two time delays. Based upon an analysis of Hopf bifurcation, we demonstrate that time delays can induce spatial patterns under some conditions. Moreover, by use of a series of numerical simulations, we show that the type of spatial patterns is the spiral wave. Finally, we demonstrate that the spiral wave is asymptotically stable."

Electrical Characterization and Thermal Admittance Spectroscopy Analysis of InGaN/GaN MQW Blue LED Structure,2015,"['LED', 'multiple-quantum-well', 'InGaN/GaN', 'admittance spectroscopy']",,"Characterizations of InGaN/GaN-quantum wells based LED heterostructure were undertaken by static and dynamic electrical measurements at different temperatures. The analysis of the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics demonstrated different mechanisms involved in the current charge transport in the LED device. Experimental admittance spectra have been investigated in broad frequency range, at various temperature and different direct current biases. A specific extraction of the quantum well conductance, based on Nicollian and Goetzberger’s model related to interface state conductance in Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor structure, has shown the effect of the quantum structure on the electric transport, and hence a correlation between the I-V electrical characteristics and the admittance spectroscopy has revealed the different conduction mechanisms involved in the charge transport in the InGaN/GaN LED. Activation energies and carrier capture velocity obtained from Arrhenius plots, determined from the thermally activated quantum well conductance peaks which are revealed with the used model, have confirmed that quantum well parameters are related to the carrier emission from confined levels in quantum wells."
Microstructural properties of GaN grown on a Si(110) substrate by gassource molecular beam epitaxy: Dependence on the ammonia flux,2015,"['Nitrides', 'Transmission electron microscopy', 'Dislocation', 'Gas-source molecular beam epitaxy', 'Silicon substrate']",,"The microstructural properties of a GaN thin film grown on a Si(110) substrate under various ammonia (NH3)-flux conditions were observed to study growth mode and defect evolution. The surface flatness of GaN thin films was improved with the increase of the NH3 flux while the thickness was decreased by increasing the NH3 flux. In addition, the crystalline quality of the GaN film grown under the lower NH3 flux (100 sccm) was better than that of the film under the higher NH3 flux (400 sccm). The different dislocation behaviors depending on NH3 fluxes were observed; the low density of dislocations was measured and most of dislocations penetrating the thin film was mixed- and edge-type dislocations when GaN was grown under the low NH3 flux condition while the high density of dislocation and many mixed- and screw-type dislocations penetrating the film were observed in the GaN film grown under the high NH3 flux. These phenomena are demonstrated by using a kinetic model related to the role of NH3."

Frequency-dependent C-V Characteristic-based Extraction of Interface Trap Density in Normally-off Gate-recessed AlGaN/GaN Heterojunction Field-effect Transistors,2015,"['normally-off', 'gate-recessed', 'AlGaN/GaN HFETs', 'interface trap density', 'frequency-dependent C-V']",,"It is essential to acquire an accurate and simple technique for extracting the interface trap density ($D_{it}$) in order to characterize the normally-off gate-recessed AlGaN/GaN hetero field-effect transistors (HFETs) because they can undergo interface trap generation induced by the etch damage in each interfacial layer provoking the degradation of device performance as well as serious instability.

Lactobacillus rhamnosus CCFM1107 treatment ameliorates alcohol -induced liver injury in a mouse model of chronic alcohol feeding,2015,"['probiotics', 'alcoholic liver injury', 'oxidative stress', 'intestinal flora', 'endotoxin']",,"Lactobacillus rhamnosus CCFM1107 was screened for high antioxidative activity from 55 lactobacilli. The present study attempted to explore the protective properties of L. rhamnosus CCFM1107 in alcoholic liver injury. A mouse model was induced by orally feeding alcohol when simultaneously treated with L. rhamnosus CCFM1107, the drug Hu-Gan- Pian (HGP), L. rhamnosus GG (LGG), and L. plantarum CCFM1112 for 3 months. Biochemical analysis was performed for both serum and liver homogenate. Detailed intestinal flora and histological analyses were also carried out. Our results indicated that the administration of L. rhamnosus CCFM1107 significantly inhibited the increase in the levels of serum aminotransferase and endotoxin, as well as the levels of triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (CHO) in the serum and in the liver. Glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were elevated while the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were decreased. The enteric dysbiosis caused by alcohol was restored by increasing the numbers of both lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and decreasing the numbers of both enterococci and enterobacter. Histological analysis confirmed the protective effect of L. rhamnosus CCFM1107. Compared with the other lactobacilli and to the drug Hu-Gan-Pian, there is a high chance that L. rhamnosus CCFM1107 provides protective effects on alcoholic liver injury by reducing oxidative stress and restoring the intestinal flora."

Evolution and Analysis of Nitride Surface and Interfaces by Statistical Techniques: A Correlation with RHEED through Kinetic Roughening,2015,"['III-nitride surface', 'AFM', 'growth model', 'HR-XRD', 'RHEED', 'statistical and fractal']",,"In-situ RHEED and ex-situ AFM characterizations have been employed to investigate transformations of surface topography with the thickness of PAMBE grown AlGaN and InGaN on GaN. The ternary alloys have been grown with identical growth-front roughness as confirmed by XRR and RHEED observations. The spottier RHEED has been observed with increased thickness of the InGaN as opposed to streakier behavior of AlGaN. We have noticed incremental nature of RMS roughness, skewness and kurtosis of InGaN surface compared to GaN or AlGaN from AFM as evident by final spotty RHEED for InGaN. However, the analyzed fractal dimension is lower for InGaN as opposed to AlGaN ( ). From the kinetic roughening perspective of adatoms, the experimental evidences lead to the high correlation between binding energy of the cluster atoms ( ) and the modified DDA growth model with dissociation and evaporation to confirm the efficacy of the study. The initial streaky and spotty RHEED of InGaN and AlGaN, respectively, can be attributed to their Eb that causes smoothing and roughening of the GaN surface due to adatoms surface mobility behavior. Therefore, the fractal description reveals the fact during formation of nitride hetero-interface while other AFM results describe the top surface."
New Medical Image Fusion Approach with Coding Based on SCD in Wireless Sensor Network,2015,"['Big-data', 'Medical image', 'Spherical coordinate', 'Fusion']",,"The technical development and practical applications of big-data for health is one hot topic under the banner of big-data. Big-data medical image fusion is one of key problems. A new fusion approach with coding based on Spherical Coordinate Domain (SCD) in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for big-data medical image is proposed in this paper. In this approach, the three highfrequency coefficients in wavelet domain of medical image are pre-processed. This pre-processing strategy can reduce the redundant ratio of big-data medical image. Firstly, the high-frequency coefficients are transformed to the spherical coordinate domain to reduce the correlation in the same scale. Then, a multi-scale model product (MSMP) is used to control the shrinkage function so as to make the small wavelet coefficients and some noise removed. The high-frequency parts in spherical coordinate domain are coded by improved SPIHT algorithm. Finally, based on the multi-scale edge of medical image, it can be fused and reconstructed. Experimental results indicate the novel approach is effective and very useful for transmission of big-data medical image(especially, in the wireless environment)."

Their alternative type to existing Confucianism, proposed by them, is so called ‘Political Confucianism’, ‘People’s Confucianism’, ‘Institutional Confucianism’. Their argument is connected to the idea of searching for Chinese model in the times of ‘The rise of China’. Neo-Confucianists in Chinese continent orient their Confucianism as the idea to overcome Western modernity and have difference to the Neo-Confucianism in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In January of 2015 Li Minghuei(李明輝), the successor of Neo-Confucianism in Taiwan, criticized the argument of Political Confucianism. His criticism cause the debate between the Confucianists of Chinese continent and Taiwan. Their debate revealed the difference of the view on the Neo-Confucianism and social context of both sides. Furthermore it is relevant to the view on modern Western political theories, Chinese modern history since New Culture Movement, based on pursuing Western modernity. The main point in criticizing Li Minghuei is that Li cannot understand the situation of China, insist that their Confucianism is the result of dealing with the Chinese situation. The hole process of argument and debates on Political Confucianism reveal that Chinese Confucianism have continued to develop, through searching for reinforcing its influence on Chinese reality."

Data was measured for the 0° and 45° horizontal wind approach directions and vertical attack angles ranging from -4.5° to +4.5°. Analysis of the power spectrum of the fluctuating lift indicated that vertical vortex oscillations could be significant for VMS with a large depth ratio attached to a structure with a low natural frequency. Analysis of the galloping test data indicated that VMS with large depth ratios, greater than about 0.5, and low natural frequency could also be subject to galloping instability."
