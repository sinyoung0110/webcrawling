딥러닝을 이용한 고압 수소에 의하여 손상된 Acrylonitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) 단면 균열 탐지,2021,"['딥러닝(Deep learning)', '균열 탐지(Crack Detection)', '인공신경망(Artificial neural network)', '객체인식(Object detection)', '반 자동화 라벨링(Semi-automated labeling)']",,"Demand for understanding material behaviors in hydrogen rich environment rises due to the extended use of hydrogen gas. Organic material such as rubber used in O-rings for hydrogen containers displays pore-like cracks when it is exposed extensively to high pressure hydrogen. To find the optimal organic material in a certain hydrogen rich environment, a method for localizing and analyzing pore-like cracks must be devised. This paper deals with a new method to detect high pressure hydrogen induced cracksusing deep learning algorithms. In this study, acrylonitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) was exposed to hydrogen of 96.6MPa for 24 hours. Images were taken of the appearing pore like cracks magnified by 100. For bounding box labeling a semi-automated labeling was used using maximally. stable extremal region (MSER) features on graphical contours. The crack detection model was trained adopting the structure of faster R-CNN using ResNet50 as its backbone network. The resulting artificial intelligence model showed robust and accurate detecting ability."
