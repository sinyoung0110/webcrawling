군집 별 표준곡선 매개변수를 이용한 치밀오일 생산성 예측 순환신경망 모델,2021,"['Tight oil', 'LSTM', 'GRU', 'Clustering analysis', 'Type curve']","치밀오일 미래 생산성 예측은 잔류오일 회수량 및 저류층 거동 분석을 위해 중요한 작업이다. 일반적으로 석유공학적 관점에서 감퇴곡선법을 이용하여 생산성 예측이 이루어지는데, 최근에는 데이터기반의 머신러닝 기법을 이용한 연구도 수행되고 있다. 본 연구에서는 딥러닝 기반 순환신경망과 LSTM, GRU 알고리즘을 이용하여 미래 생산량 예측을 위한 효과적인 모델을 제안하고자 한다. 입력변수로는 치밀오일 생산 시 산출되는 오일, 가스, 물과 이와 더불어 다양한 군집분석을 통해 산출된 표준곡선이 주요 매개변수이고, 출력변수는 월별 오일 생산량이다. 기존의 경험적 모델인 감퇴곡선법과 순환신경망 모델들을 비교하였으며, 모델의 예측성능을 향상시키기 위해 하이퍼파라미터 튜닝을 통해 최적 모델을 도출하였다.","Predicting future productivity of tight oil is an important task for analyzing residual oil recovery and reservoir behavior. In general, productivity prediction is made using the decline curve analysis(DCA). In this study, we intend to propose an effective model for predicting future production using deep learning-based recurrent neural networks(RNN). LSTM, and GRU algorithms. As input variables, the main parameters are oil, gas, water, which are calculated during the production of tight oil, and the type curve calculated through various cluster analyzes. the output variable is the monthly oil production. Existing empirical models, the DCA and RNN models, were compared, and an optimal model was derived through hyperparameter tuning to improve the predictive performance of the model."
Online Tourism Review : Three Phases for Successful Destination Relationships,2015,"['Online Tourism Reviews', 'Longitudinal Trust-Satisfaction Model (LSTM)', 'Extended Valence Framework (EVF)', 'Expectation-Confirmation Theory (ECT)']",,"This study developed a conceptual model that integrated psychological and physical reactions resulting from online tourism reviews through a longitudinal trust-satisfaction model (LSTM) developed based on the extended valence framework and expectation-confirmation theory. Online reviews are essential factor of consumer's purchase decision. This phenomenon is well applied in a tourism context. However, investigations on online reviews in a longitudinal approach in a tourism context are quite limited. Therefore, this study suggests a conceptual model based on LTSM and several propositions about how online tourism reviews, which are divided into factual and experiential reviews, influence the future travelers' perceptions and attitudes, such as expectation, confirmation, and destination loyalty, in a longitudinal format by examining previous related studies. Finally, expected results were discussed and several implications were described theoretically and practically."
