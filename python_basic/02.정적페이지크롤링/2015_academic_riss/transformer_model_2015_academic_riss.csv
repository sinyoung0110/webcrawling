Partial Discharge Localization Based on Detailed Models of Transformer and Wavelet Transform Techniques,2015,"['Wavelet transform', 'Power transformer', 'RLC model', 'Multi-conductor transmission line(MTL)', 'Partial discharge', 'PD localization']",,"Partial Discharge (PD) is a physical phenomenon, which causes defects and damages to the insulation. This phenomenon is regarded as the most important source of fault and defect in power transformers. Therefore, methods of high speed and precision are considered of special importance for the maintenance of transformers in localization of the origin of partial discharge. In this paper, the transformer winding is first modeled in a transient state by using RLC ladder network and multiconductor transmission line (MTL) models. The parameters of the two models were calculated by Ansoft Maxwell software, and the simulations were performed by Matlab software. Then, the PD pulses were applied to the models with different widths of pulses. With regard to the fact that the signals received after the application of PD had a variable frequency nature over time, and based on the wavelet transform and signal energy, a new method was presented for the localization of PD. Ultimately; the mentioned method was implemented on a 20 kV winding distribution transformer. Then, the performances of the models used in this paper, including RLC and MTL models, were compared in different frequency bands for the correct distinction of partial discharge location."

"Evaluation of Eye Irritation Potential of Solid Substance with New 3D Reconstructed Human Cornea Model, MCTT HCE<sup>TM</sup>",2015,"['Eye irritation', 'Reconstructed cornea model', 'MCTT HCE $^{TM}$ model', 'Protocol refinement']",,"The eye irritation potential of drug candidates or pharmaceutical ingredients should be evaluated if there is a possibility of ocular exposure. Traditionally, the ocular irritation has been evaluated by the rabbit Draize test. However, rabbit eyes are more sensitive to irritants than human eyes, therefore substantial level of false positives are unavoidable. To resolve this species difference, several three-dimensional human corneal epithelial (HCE) models have been developed as alternative eye irritation test methods. Recently, we introduced a new HCE model, MCTT HCE$^{TM}$ which is reconstructed with non-transformed human corneal cells from limbal tissues. Here, we examined if MCTT HCE$^{TM}$ can be employed to evaluate eye irritation potential of solid substances. Through optimization of washing method and exposure time, treatment time was established as 10 min and washing procedure was set up as 4 times of washing with 10 mL of PBS and shaking in 30 mL of PBS in a beaker. With the established eye irritation test protocol, 11 solid substances (5 non-irritants, 6 irritants) were evaluated which demonstrated an excellent predictive capacity (100% accuracy, 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity). We also compared the performance of our test method with rabbit Draize test results and in vitro cytotoxicity test with 2D human corneal epithelial cell lines."

Inner harbour wave agitation using boussinesq wave model,2015,"['Boussinesq wave model', 'Harbour tranquility', 'Wave disturbance', 'Wave climate']",,Short crested waves play an important role for planning and design of harbours. In this context a numerical simulation is carried out to evaluate wave tranquility inside a real harbour located in east coast of India. The annual offshore wave climate proximity to harbour site is established using Wave Model (WAM) hindcast wave data. The deep water waves are transformed to harbour front using a Near Shore spectral Wave model (NSW).

Canonical Quantization of the Dissipative Hofstadter Model,2015,"['Dissipative Hofstadter model', 'Target space duality', 'Boundary state', 'Canonical quantization', 'Noncommutative algebra']",,"We perform canonical quantization of the dissipative Hofstadter model, which has a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics and string theory. The target space duality and the non-commutative algebra developed in string theory are discussed for the model. We show that the target space duality transformation of closed string theory, O(2, 2;R), removes the interaction with a uniform magnetic field. The O(2, 2;R) dual transformation changes the basis of the oscillator operators so that the algebra of the string coordinate operators at the boundary becomes noncommutative.In the zero temperature limit, the non-commutative algebra of open string theory emerges. We also developed the boundary state formulation for the dissipative Hofstadter model."

A simple and efficient 1-D macroscopic model for shape memory alloys considering ferro-elasticity effect,2015,"['shape memory alloys', 'constitutive modeling', 'martensitic transformation', 'pseudo-elasticity', 'ferro-elasticity']",,"In this paper, a simple and efficient phenomenological macroscopic one-dimensional model is proposed which is able to simulate main features of shape memory alloys (SMAs) particularly ferro-elasticity effect. The constitutive model is developed within the framework of thermodynamics of irreversible processes to simulate the one-dimensional behavior of SMAs under uniaxial simple tension-compression as well as pure torsion+/- loadings. Various functions including linear, cosine and exponential functions are introduced in a unified framework for the martensite transformation kinetics and an analytical description of constitutive equations is presented. The presented model can be used to reproduce primary aspects of SMAs including transformation/orientation of martensite phase, shape memory effect, pseudo-elasticity and in particular ferro-elasticity. Experimental results available in the open literature for uniaxial tension, torsion and bending tests are simulated to validate the present SMA model in capturing the main mechanical characteristics. Due to simplicity and accuracy, it is expected the present SMA model will be instrumental toward an accurate analysis of SMA components in various engineering structures particularly when the ferro-elasticity is obvious."
Design of Autonomous Cruise Controller with Linear Time Varying Model,2015,"['Autonomous cruise control', 'Adaptive cruise control', 'Linear parameter varying system', 'Linear time varying system']",,"Cruise control is a technology for automatically maintaining a steady speed of vehicle as set by the driver via controlling throttle valve and brake of vehicle. In this paper we investigate cruise controller design method with consideration for distance to vehicle ahead. We employ linear time varying (LTV) model to describe longitudinal vehicle dynamic motion. With this LTV system we approximately model the nonlinear dynamics of vehicle speed by frequent update of the system parameters. In addition we reformulate the LTV system by transforming distance to leading vehicle into variation of system parameters of the model. Note that in conventional control problem formulation this distance is considered as disturbance which should be rejected. Consequently a controller can be designed by pole placement at each instance of parameter update, based on the linear model with the present system parameters. The validity of this design method is examined by simulation study."

H∞ Synchronization of Two Different Discrete-Time Chaotic Systems via a Unified Model,2015,"['H∞ synchronization', 'chaotic systems', 'different time delays', 'discrete-time system', 'drive-response conception']",,"This paper presents some novel synchronization methods for two discrete-time chaotic systems with different time delays, which are transformed into two unified models. First, the H∞ performance of the synchronization error dynamical system between the drive unified model and the response one is analyzed using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Second, the novel state feedback controllers are established to guarantee H∞ performance for the overall system. The parameters of these controllers are determined by solving the eigenvalue problem (EVP). Most discrete-time chaotic systems with or without time delays can be converted into this unified model, and H∞ synchronization controllers are designed in a unified way. The effectiveness of the proposed design methods are demonstrated by three numerical examples."
A Model on the Rise and Decline of South Korean Anti-American Sentiment,2015,"['anti-American sentiment', 'South Korea', 'generational effect', 'period effect', 'candle light vigil', 'cognitive basis', 'emotional incidents']",,"Most of the literature on the 2002 candlelight vigils in South Korea (Korea) has ascribed the cause of the anti-Americanism of these protests to domestic factors. Authors predicted that any change in United States policy on Korea would not substantially improve the two countries’ strained alliance because the fundamental problem was rooted in Korea’s domestic transformation and subsequent shifts in perspective towards North Korea. However, South Korea has once again become one of the world’s most pro-American countries. This study claims that South Korea’s domestic transformation is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to give rise to anti-American protest and thus anti-American sentiment is merely latent in the South Korean public consciousness and will not manifest itself unless it is ill-managed. A comprehensive analytical model is presented to predict the rise and decline of anti-American protest, incorporating period as well as generational effect. The model depicts the dynamic process of mass demonstrations in which cognitive basis and emotional incidents interact."
DEVELOPMENT OF A TIRE MODEL BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF TIRE STRAIN OBTAINED BY AN INTELLIGENT TIRE SYSTEM,2015,"['Intelligent tire system', 'Tire model', 'Tire strain', 'Simulation', 'Tire contact patch']",,"Tires perform important roles, such as supporting weight and generating forces during accelerating or braking.However, the direct acquisition of valuable data from tires is limited because of the nonlinearity and complex composition of tires. Recently, an intelligent tire system was developed to obtain tire-related variables directly from tire strain. The strain of the tire is measured using a strain sensor; strain is then transformed to other valuable variables, such as the vertical load and the road friction coefficient. However, to develop the conversion logic needed to obtain tire-related variables from the strain, costly and extensive experiments are needed. In this study, we propose a novel tire model and an intelligent tire simulation to reduce the effort and cost for developing an intelligent tire system. Based on experimental data, a tire model, one that can reflect the relationships between driving conditions and tire strain, was derived. And, using a set of polynomial equations comprised of the decisive parameters, a simple algebraic model was developed to yield light computational load. Finally, it was verified that the proposed tire model can correctly estimate not only the tire strain but also the 1st differential values of tire strain."

Exergy Analysis of Various Absorption Heat Transformer Systems Using Classical and Modi¯ed Gouy–Stodola Equation,2015,"['Various absorption heat transformer systems', 'hot °uid produced', 'classical and modi ¯ed Gouy–Stodola equation.']",,"In the present study, performance evaluation of three di®erent con¯gurations of absorption heattransformer (AHT) is carried out by supplying the waste heat of same mass and same temperature;and exergy analysis is done using both the classical and modi¯ed Gouy–stodola equation.For this a mathematical model is developed for all the three arrangements in EngineeringEquation Solver. Water–lithium bromide is used as a working pair. The results of exergy destructionwith classical and modi¯ed Gouy–stodola equation are compared for di®erent systems.Further various operating parameters are varied to predict the performance of the systems on thebasis of second law analysis. The result showed that the amount of hot °uid produced in absorberis more for system 3 as compared to other con¯gurations. The irreversibility calculated by themodi¯ed approach comes out to be 25.78%, 23.60%, and 23.45% more than the exergy destructionobtained by the classical approach in the three cases, respectively. Thus, there is a need to employthe modi¯ed approach of Gouy–Stodola equation for calculating the real irreversibility whichhelps in predicting the scope of improvement and the performance of the system more accurately"

Application of SFCL on Bus Tie for Parallel Operation of Power Main Transformers in a Fuel Cell Power Systems,2015,"['DG interconnection', 'Parallel operation', 'Fuel cell', 'SFCL', 'Protection']",,"In the power plant using high temperature fuel cells such as Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell(MCFC), and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell(SOFC), the generated electric power per area of power generation facilities is much higher than any other renewable energy sources. - High temperature fuel cell systems are capable of operating at MW rated power output. - It also has a feature that is short for length of the line for connecting the interior of the generation facilities. In normal condition, these points are advantages for voltage drops or power losses. However, in abnormal condition such as fault occurrence in electrical system, the fault currents are increased, because of the small impedance of the short length of power cable. Commonly, to minimize the thermal-mechanical stresses on the stack and increase the systems reliability, we divided the power plant configuration to several banks for parallel operation. However, when a fault occurs in the parallel operation system of power main transformer, the fault currents might exceed the interruption capacity of protective devices. In fact, although the internal voltage level of the fuel cell power plant is the voltage level of distribution systems, we should install the circuit breakers for transmission systems due to fault current. To resolve these problems, the SFCL has been studied as one of the noticeable devices. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of application of the SFCL on bus tie in a fuel cell power plants system using PSCAD/EMTDC."
Antiallergic Effects of Trichostatin A in a Murine Model of Allergic Rhinitis,2015,"['Allergic Rhinitis', 'Trichostatin A', 'Histone Deacetylases', 'Ovalbumin', 'Mice']",,"Objectives. Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, has been shown to play an important role in attenuating asthmatic inflammation. However, the effect of TSA in allergic rhinitis is not known. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of TSA on allergic nasal inflammation and on the induction of regulatory T cells in a murine model of allergic rhinitis. Methods. BALB/c mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin (OVA) and then challenged intranasally with OVA. TSA (1 mg/kg) was given to the treatment group, and multiple parameters of allergic responses were evaluated to determine the effects of TSA on allergic rhinitis. Allergic nasal symptom scores, including frequency of rubbing and sneezing, were checked. Eosinophil infiltrations were stained with Chromotrope 2R, and the expression levels of OVA-specific IgE, T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokine (interferon-gamma [IFN-γ]), Th2 cytokines (interleukin [IL] 4 and IL-5) and Treg (Foxp3, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-beta [TGF-β]) were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. TSA reduced the scores of allergic nasal symptoms and the amount of eosinophil infiltration into the nasal mucosa. TSA suppressed OVA-specific IgE levels and reduced expression of the IL-4 and IL-5. However, the expression of IFN-γ was unchanged in the treatment group. The levels of Foxp3, IL-10, and TGF-β were increased in pretreatment with TSA as compared to control group. Conclusion. This study shows that TSA induced antiallergic effects by decreasing eosinophilic infiltration and Th2 cytokines in a murine model of allergic rhinitis via regulation of Tregs. Thus, TSA may be considered a potentially therapeutic agent in treating allergic rhinitis."
Seismic behavior of RC building by considering a model for shear wall-floor slab connections,2015,"['connection', 'floor slab', 'shear wall', 'FE method', 'seismic effects']",,"Connections are the most important regions in a structural system especially for buildings in seismic zones. In R.C. structures due to large dimensions of members and lack of cognition of the stress distribution in a connection, reaching a comprehensive understanding of the connection behaviors becomes more complicated. The shear wall-to-floor slab connections in lateral load resisting systems have a potential weakness in transferring loads from slabs to shear walls which might change the path of load transformation to shear walls. This paper tries to investigate the effects of seismic load combinations on the behavior of slabs at their connection zones with the shear walls. These connection zones naturally are the most critical regions of the slabs in RC buildings. The investigation carried on in a simulated environment by considering three different structures with different shear wall layout. The final results of our study reveal that layout of shear walls in a building significantly affects the magnification of forces developed at the shear wall-floor slab connections."
Wound Healing Effects of Rose Placenta in a Mouse Model of Full-Thickness Wounds,2015,"['Wound healing', 'Rosa', 'Epidermal growth factor', 'Mice']",,"Background Rosa damascena, a type of herb, has been used for wound healing in Eastern folk medicine. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of rose placenta from R. damascena in a full-thickness wound model in mice.Methods Sixty six-week-old C57BL/6N mice were used. Full-thickness wounds were made with an 8-mm diameter punch. Two wounds were made on each side of the back, and wounds were assigned randomly to the control and experimental groups. Rose placenta (250 μg) was injected in the experimental group, and normal saline was injected in the control group.Wound sizes were measured with digital photography, and specimens were harvested.Immunohistochemical staining was performed to assess the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and CD31. Vessel density was measured. Quantitative analysis using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for EGF was performed. All evaluations were performed on postoperative days 0, 2, 4, 7, and 10. Statistical analyses were performed using the paired t-test.Results On days 4, 7, and 10, the wounds treated with rose placenta were significantly smaller.On day 2, VEGF and EGF expression increased in the experimental group. On days 7 and 10, TGF-β1 expression decreased in the experimental group. On day 10, vessel density increased in the experimental group. The increase in EGF on day 2 was confirmed with ELISA.Conclusions Rose placenta was found to be associated with improved wound healing in a mouse full-thickness wound model via increased EGF release. Rose placenta may potentially be a novel drug candidate for enhancing wound healing."

On day 2, VEGF and EGF expression increased in the experimental group. On days 7 and 10, TGF-${\beta}1$ expression decreased in the experimental group. On day 10, vessel density increased in the experimental group. The increase in EGF on day 2 was confirmed with ELISA. Conclusions Rose placenta was found to be associated with improved wound healing in a mouse full-thickness wound model via increased EGF release. Rose placenta may potentially be a novel drug candidate for enhancing wound healing."

This study proposes a hybrid model for river stage forecasting and investigates its accuracy. The proposed model is the wavelet packet-based artificial neural network(WPANN). Wavelet packet transform(WPT) module in WPANN model is employed to decompose an input time series into approximation and detail components. The decomposed time series are then used as inputs of artificial neural network(ANN) module in WPANN model. Based on model performance indexes, WPANN models are found to produce better efficiency than ANN model. WPANN-sym10 model yields the best performance among all other models. It is found that WPT improves the accuracy of ANN model. The results obtained from this study indicate that the conjunction of WPT and ANN can improve the efficiency of ANN model and can be a potential tool for forecasting river stage more accurately."

Mozambique drew scholarly attention as it maintained 7% average GDP growth since 2000, achieved both economic growth and political stability, and drove HCI-centered manufacturing industrial transformation rather than using its static comparative advantage from abundant natural resources. Some features of East Asian developmental model are also found in the Mozambican case: state capacity during democratization and privatization through political coalition with the vested interest, and active governmental intervention in industrial transformation with industrial policy to create dynamic comparative advantage. However, embedded autonomy of East Asian model was weak as cooperation network between the state and the society was captured by the vested interest. Furthermore, the Mozambican government preferred joint ventures with MNCs over domestic companies in promoting industrial transformation. As a result, unlike East Asia, the industrial transformation was not linked to further development of other domestic industries."

This study suggests use of concept models as a mediation means by which to apply the design concept used for spatial design process to space. This study aims to interpret the abstract concept of spatial design as a 3-D concept model, by mediation of which to suggest educational methods applying it to spatial design, and to analyze usability & types of concept models. Through this, effective educational methods enabling more creative spatial design are explored. Result of this study shows that the utilization of concept models is found useful to students learning spatial design. 5 categories of methods by which to express design concepts in the form of concept models are analyzed; morphologization via motifs, embodiment of linguistic meanings, imagery transformation, embodiment of a process/situation and convergent interpretation in conjunction to other fields(music, literature, IT). These results reveal the advantage that morphological interpretation via conceptual models eases the formative expression of space design, and that it eases the difficulty beginners learning spatial design have. It also has an advantage that learners can have formative studies in relatively liberal manner, freed of large-scale pressure imposed upon them by space. Accordingly, result of this study shows a possibility that conceptual models can be utilized as an effective tool for education of spatial design."

Social networked journalism allows the public to be involved in every aspect of journalism production through crowd-sourcing and interactivity. The networking effect with the public is driving journalism to transform into a more open, more networked and more responsive venue. “wikitree” is a social networking news service on which anybody can write news and disseminate it via Facebook and Twitter. It is operated as an open sourced program which incorporates “Google Translate” to automatically convert all its content, enabling any global citizen with an Internet access to contribute news production and share either their own creative contents or generated contents from other sources. Since its inception, “wikitree global” site has been expanding its coverage rapidly with access points arising from 160 countries. Analyzing its international coverage by country and by news category as well as by the unique visit numbers via SNS, the results of the case study imply that networking with the global public can enhance news traffic to the social news site as well as to specific news items. The results also suggest that the utilization of Twitter and Facebook in social networked journalism can break the boundary between local and global public by extending news-gathering ability while growing audience`s interest in the site, and engender a feasible business model for a local online journalism."

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING AND ITS SIMULATION OF A QUASI-STATIC THERMOELASTIC PROBLEM IN A SEMI-INFINITE HOLLOW CIRCULAR DISK DUE TO INTERNAL HEAT GENERATION,2015,"['Quasi-static', 'Thermal Stresses', 'Internal Heat Generation', 'Unsteady-State Temperature', 'Circular Disk']",,"The present paper deals with the determination of temperature, displacement and thermal stresses in a semi-infinite hollow circular disk due to internal heat generation within it.

The heat flux is applied on the inner circular boundary (r = a) and the outer circular boundary (r = b). Also, the lower surface (z = 0) is kept at temperature Q₃(r, t) and the upper surface (z = ∞) is kept at zero temperature. Hollow circular disk extends in the z-direction from z = 0 to infinity. The governing heat conduction equation has been solved by using finite Hankel transform and the generalized finite Fourier transform. As a special case mathematical model is constructed for different metallic disk have been considered. The results are obtained in series form in terms of Bessel’s functions. These have been computed numerically and illustrated graphically."
Monthly metabolic changes and PLS prediction of carotenoid content of citrus fruit by combined Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and quantitative HPLC analysis,2015,"['Carotenoids', 'Citrus fruit', 'Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy', 'Metabolic change', 'PCA', 'PLS regression']",,"This work examined the potential of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis in evaluating metabolic changes during ripening of citrus fruit. Further, the feasibility of prediction modeling of carotenoid content by multivariate statistical analysis combined with FT-IR spectral and HPLC data was examined without additional HPLC analysis. FT-IR spectra of citrus (Citrus unshiu Marc. cv. Miyagawa) fruit peels and flesh were measured at monthly intervals of fruit development. Quantification of carotenoids from the fruit was confirmed by quantitative HPLC analysis. The most remarkable evolution of FT-IR spectral decrease during ripening of fruit was found in the amide region (1500–1700 cm-1), whereas there was an increase in the carbohydrate region (1000–1200 cm-1). The evolution of different FT-IR spectral bands was related to fruit constituents, including organic acids, carbohydrates, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds. Significant qualitative changes in the carotenoid pattern included an increase in bcryptoxanthin and decrease in lutein content during citrus fruit development. The content of antheraxanthin (R2 = 0.9117), β-carotene (R2 = 0.8816), β-cryptoxanthin (R2 = 0.8856), and violaxanthin (R2 = 0.7305) from peels of citrus fruit could be predicted from FT-IR spectral data using partial least square (PLS) regression modeling. Considering the results of PLS-discriminant analysis (PLSDA) of FT-IR spectral data and PLS regression modeling of carotenoid content, FT-IR in combination with multivariate analysis enables not only discrimination of metabolic variation during fruit development, but also prediction of carotenoid content from citrus fruit."
APPLICATIONS OF THE HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM ON THE NON-STATIONARY ASTRONOMICAL TIME SERIES,2015,"['accretion', 'accretion disks', 'galaxies: Seyfert', 'X-rays: galaxies', 'binaries', 'individuals (SMC X-1', 'RE J1034+396)']",,"The development of time-frequency analysis techniques allow astronomers to successfully deal with the non-stationary time series that originate from unstable physical mechanisms. We applied a recently developed time-frequency analysis method, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), to two non-stationary phenomena: the superorbital modulation in the high-mass X-ray binary SMC X-1 and the quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) of the AGN RE J1034+396. From the analysis of SMC X-1, we obtained a Hilbert spectrum that shows more detailed information in both the time and frequency domains. Then, a phase-resolved analysis of both the spectra and the orbital profiles was presented. From the spectral analysis, we noticed that the iron line production is dominated by different regions of this binary system in different superorbital phases. Furthermore, a pre-eclipse dip lying at orbital phase ~0:6-0:85 was discovered during the superorbital transition state. We further applied the HHT to analyze the QPO of RE J1034+396. From the Hilbert spectrum and the O-C analysis results, we suggest that it is better to divide the evolution of the QPO into three epochs according to their different periodicities. The correlations between the QPO periods and corresponding fluxes were also different in these three epochs. The change in periodicity and the relationships could be interpreted as the change in oscillation mode based on the diskoseismology model."

In this study, weexamined whether expression of TLR4 and TLR5 was associated with progression of prostate transformation in the transgenic adenocarcinomaof mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. The expression of TLR4 and TLR5 was evaluated by immunohistochemisty in formalin-fixedparaffin-embedded prostate tissue from wild-type (WT) and TRAMP mice. Normal prostate tissue from WT mice showed strong expressionof TLR4 and TLR5. However, TLR4 expression in the prostate tissue from TRAMP mice gradually decreased as pathologic grade becamemore aggressive. TLR5 expression in the prostate tissue from TRAMP mice also decreased in low-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia(PIN), high-grade PIN and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Overall, our results suggest that decreased expression of TLR4 and TLR5may contribute to prostate tumorigenesis."

A novel direct power control (DPC) strategy, which is based on the sliding mode control (SMC) for Vienna I rectifiers, is developed using the proposed power model in the stationary α-β reference frames. The SMC-based DPC methodology directly regulates instantaneous active and reactive powers without transforming to a synchronous rotating coordinate reference frame or a tracking phase angle of grid voltage. Moreover, the required rectifier control voltages are directly calculated by utilizing the non-linear SMC scheme. Theoretically, active and reactive power flows are controlled without ripple or cross coupling. Furthermore, the fixed-switching frequency is obtained by employing the simplified space vector modulation (SVM). SVM solves the complicated designing problem of the AC harmonic filter. The simplified SVM is based on the simplification of the space vector diagram of a three-level converter into that of a two-level converter. The dwelling time calculation and switching sequence selection are easily implemented like those in the conventional two-level rectifier. Replacing the current control loops with power control loops simplifies the system design and enhances the transient performance. The simulation models in MATLAB/Simulink and the digital signal processor-controlled 1.5 kW Vienna-type rectifier are used to verify the fast responses and robustness of the proposed control scheme."

The proposed control architecture will consist of a switching control scheme, based on multiple model predictive controllers, for the articulated vehicle under varying slip angles. The controllers will be developed in order to improve the performance of the articulated vehicle’s path tracking, while compensating the varying slippage effect. The current measured slip angle is being considered as the switching rule and a corresponding switching control scheme is being defined, being able to apply constraints on the states, the control signal and the output variables. Both the non-slip and slip models will be derived to highlight the significance of accounting for slips in path following control and their significant effect on deteriorating the performance of the overall control scheme when not considered.Multiple simulation results will be presented to prove the efficacy of the overall suggested scheme."

In addition, several recent studies have reported that TGF-β receptor (TGF-βR) gene polymorphism is associated with chronic kidney disease.However, the association between end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the TGF-β gene polymorphism has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we hypothesized that polymorphisms of the TGF-β ligands or their receptors may be related to ESRD.Methods: We assessed the relationship between four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TGF-βR2 and TGF-β2 genes and ESRD, in 312 patients with ESRD and 258 controls.Results: Compared with the control participants, the frequencies of the TGF-βR2 (rs764522nC) and TGF-βR2 (rs3087465nG) alleles were significantly higher in the patients with ESRD.

Application of the differential transformation method for nonlocal vibration analysis of functionally graded nanobeams,2015,"['Differential transformation method', 'Functionally graded material', 'Nanobeam', 'Nonlocal elasticity', 'Vibration']",,"In this study, the applicability of differential transformation method (DTM) in investigations on vibrational characteristics of functionallygraded (FG) size-dependent nanobeams is examined. The material properties of FG nanobeam vary over the thickness based on thepower law. The nonlocal Eringen theory, which takes into account the effect of small size, enables the present model to be effective in theanalysis and design of nanosensors and nanoactuators. Governing equations are derived through Hamilton’s principle. The obtained resultsexactly match the results of the presented Navier-based analytical solution as well as those available in literature. The DTM is alsodemonstrated to have high precision and computational efficiency in the vibration analysis of FG nanobeams. The detailed mathematicalderivations are presented and numerical investigations performed with emphasis placed on investigating the effects of several parameters,such as small scale effects, volume fraction index, mode number, and thickness ratio on the normalized natural frequencies of the FGnanobeams. The study also shows explicitly that vibrations of FG nanobeams are significantly influenced by these effects. Numericalresults are presented to serve as benchmarks for future analyses of FG nanobeams."
Differential transform method and numerical assembly technique for free vibration analysis of the axial-loaded Timoshenko multiple-step beam carrying a number of intermediate lumped masses and rotary inertias,2015,"['differential transform method', 'free vibration', 'intermediate lumped mass with/without rotary inertia', 'natural frequency', 'numerical assembly technique', 'Timoshenko multiple-step beam']",,"Multiple-step beams carrying intermediate lumped masses with/without rotary inertias are widely used in engineering applications, but in the literature for free vibration analysis of such structural systems; Bernoulli-Euler Beam Theory (BEBT) without axial force effect is used. The literature regarding the free vibration analysis of Bernoulli-Euler single-span beams carrying a number of spring-mass systems, Bernoulli-Euler multiple-step and multi-span beams carrying multiple spring-mass systems and multiple point masses are plenty, but that of Timoshenko multiple-step beams carrying intermediate lumped massesand/or rotary inertias with axial force effect is fewer. The purpose of this paper is to utilize Numerical Assembly Technique (NAT) and Differential Transform Method (DTM) to determine the exact natural frequencies and mode shapes of the axial-loaded Timoshenko multiple-step beam carrying a number of intermediate lumped masses and/or rotary inertias. The model allows analyzing the influence of the shear and axial force effects, intermediate lumped masses and rotary inertias on the free vibration analysis of the multiple-step beams by using Timoshenko Beam Theory (TBT). At first, the coefficient matrices for the intermediate lumped mass with rotary inertia, the step change in cross-section, left-end support and right-end support of the multiple-step Timoshenko beam are derived from the analytical solution. After the derivation of the coefficient matrices, NAT is used to establish the overall coefficient matrix for the whole vibrating system. Finally, equating the overall coefficient matrix to zero one determines the natural frequencies of the vibrating system and substituting the corresponding values of integration constants into the related eigenfunctions one determines the associated mode shapes. After the analytical solution, an efficient and easy mathematical technique called DTM is used to solve the differential equations of the motion. Thecalculated natural frequencies of Timoshenko multiple-step beam carrying intermediate lumped masses and/or rotary inertias for the different values of axial force are given in tables. The first five mode shapes are presented in graphs. The effects of axial force, intermediate lumped masses and rotary inertias on the free vibration analysis of Timoshenko multiple-step beam are investigated."
Terabit-Per-Second Optical Super-Channel Receiver Models for Partial Demultiplexing of an OFDM Spectrum,2015,"['Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)', 'Super-channel', 'Partial demultiplexing', 'Coherent modulation', 'Fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor']",,"Terabit-per-second (Tb/s) transmission capacity for the next generation of long-haul communicationnetworks can be achieved using multicarrier optical super-channel technology. In an elastic orthogonalfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) super-channel transmission system, demultiplexing a portion ofan entire spectrum in the form of a subband with minimum power is critically required. A major obstacleto achieving this goal is the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which is power-hungry and extremelyexpensive. Without a proper ADC that can work with low power, it is unrealistic to design a 100G coherentreceiver suitable for a commercially deployable optical network. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is oftenseen as a primary technique for understanding partial demultiplexing, which can be attained either opticallyor electronically. If fairly comparable performance can be achieved with an all-optical DFT circuit, thena solution independent of data rate and modulation format can be obtained. In this paper, we investigatetwo distinct OFDM super-channel receiver models, based on electronic and all-optical DFT-technologies,for partial carrier demultiplexing in a multi-Tb/s transmission system. The performance comparison of thereceivers is discussed in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) performance"
Expanding domain method for 3D time-Laplace-domain hybrid modeling,2015,"['expanding domain', 'time domain', 'Laplace-domain wavefields', 'three dimension']",,"Efficient wave propagation modeling is crucial for an efficient full waveform inversion (FWI). We adopt the expanding domain method to generate three-dimensional (3D) Laplace-domain wavefields. The Laplace-domain wavefields can be obtained by Laplace-transforming the time-domain wavefields. We accelerate the generation of Laplace-domain wavefields by applying the expanding domain method not only to the time domain wave propagation, but also to the Laplace transform by running integration. We compare three domain-expansion criteria and demonstrate that the absolute value criterion using  is applicable to the Laplace domain. The method can be applied to 3D FWIs using time-domain modeling to generate Laplace or frequency domain wavefields."

Bass(1985)에 따르면 변혁적 리더십은 거래적 리더십을 바탕으로 시너지 효과를 나타내기 때문에 두 리더십 유형 사이에는 정의 조절효과가 있을 것이라고 주장하였다. 반면 House(1996)는 종업원들의 태도나 행동에 영향을 미치는 변혁적 리더십에 거래적 리더십은 부의 조절효과를 나타낼 것이라고 제안하 며 Bass(1985)의 주장에 반박하였다.본 연구에서는 거래적 리더십의 조절효과는 문화적 차이에 따라 다를 수 있다고 주장한다. 이러 한 주장을 실증적으로 검증하기 위하여 한국 종업원 315명과 미국 종업원 181명을 그들 상사의 리더십 유형에 대해 인지하는 정도에 따라 네 집단으로 분류하여 각 집단 내 종업원들의 조직몰입 과 직무만족도 수준을 비교하였다. 그 결과, 한국 종업원들의 경우에는 네 집단 중 자신의 상사의 리더십 유형이 변혁적 리더십과 거래적 리더십 모두 높다고 느끼는 집단 내 종업원들의 조직몰입과 직무만족도가 가장 높게 나타났다. 반면 미국 종업원들의 경우에는 자신의 상사의 리더십 유형이 변혁적 리더십은 높고 거래적 리더십이 낮다고 느끼는 집단 내 종업원들의 조직몰입과 직무만족도 가 가장 높게 나타났다. 이러한 결과를 좀 더 명확히 살펴보기 위해 변혁적 리더십과 거래적 리더 십의 다양한 하위차원들 간의 조절효과를 살펴보았다. 한국 종업원들에 대한 분석결과는 조직몰입 과 직무만족도에 대해 그러한 하위차원들은 대부분이 상호 정의 조절효과를 가지는 것으로 나타났 다. 반면 미국 종업원들에 대한 분석 결과는 하위차원들 간의 조절효과가 없는 것으로 나타났다. 본 연구의 실증분석결과는 한국과 미국 종업원들이 선호하는 리더십 유형에 따라 관리자들이 어떻 게 효과적으로 리더십을 사용해야 하는지에 대한 중요한 실무적 시사점을 제공할 것이다.","In this study, the effects of two leadership styles on organizational commitment (OC) and job satisfaction (JS) are compared across countries. Based on culturally endorsed implicit leadership theory (CLT), we developed and empirically tested a two-by-two matrix model to identify differences in leadership effectiveness depending on the cultural context. Bass (1985) argued that transformational leadership (TFL) is built on a base of transactional leadership (TSL); therefore, a positive moderating effect may exist between these two leadership types. However, House (1996) challenged that argument by insisting that TSL has a negative moderating effect on employee outcome. In this study, we suggest that the moderating effect of TSL may differ depending on the culture. The results of our analysis of four groups classified according to the perceptions of subordinate workers (315 Korean and 181 U.S. employees) of TFL and TSL styles showed highest values for both OC and JS in the high-TFL and high-TSL groups in the Korean sample, while values for the high-TFL and low-TSL groups were highest for U.S. employees. To elucidate these findings further, we investigated the moderating effects of various subdimensions of TFL and TSL. The results indicated that TFL and TSL had positive moderating effects on OC and JS in Korea. However, no such moderating effect was evident in the U.S. sample. These results were consistent with the results of the two-by-two matrix. The findings of this study provide important insight into how managers can lead Korean and U.S. employees more successfully"
Masculinity and Mission: The Transformation of American Attitudes towards Jews during the “Long 1950s”,2015,"['Anti-Semitism', 'Philosemitism', '1950s', 'masculinity', 'Ben-Hur', 'Leon Uris', 'David Ben-Gurion']",,"The “long 1950s” – roughly 1948 through 1963 – witnessed a significant transformation of Christian attitudes towards Jews in the United States. Among the reasons for the change, perhaps the most surprising was an unprecedented association of Jews with vigorous masculinity at a time of national confusion and anxiety about the meaning and durability of male gender roles. All Americans felt the pull of these tensions, not least among them Protestant Christians who, despite the emergence of new male role models in their own midst, accepted tutelage from other traditions as well. Particularly powerful symbols of the new Jewish masculinity were a triad who can be thought of as the “three Bens”: on the movie screens, Judah Ben-Hur in the 1959 blockbuster film Ben-Hur; from library shelves Ari Ben Canaan, the hero of Leon Uris’s bestselling 1958 novel Exodus as well as the 1960 film made from it; and on the evening news, David Ben-Gurion, whose career as the most important figure in Israeli society and politics coincided exactly with the span of the “long 1950s.” The “three Bens” differed from other male role models in the era by their effective linkage of hyper-masculinity with a sense of focused purpose. The union of masculinity and mission would help shape American ideals and ideologies in the 1960s and beyond."

Understanding environmental processes requires accounting for the flow of matter within and between systems and using atomic-molecular models to describe macroscopic processes. Most students were unable to do this consistently, especially for transformations between gases and solid or liquid substances. Students attributed three characteristics to solids or liquids but not always to gases: a) mass, (students tend to treat gas as nothing and therefore having little or no mass), b) chemical identity, (students tend to refer to gas as air or oxygen no matter what the actual gas is or wherever it comes from), and c) matter-energy distinction, (students tend to consider the conditions or forms of energy as matter rather than as transformation of matter-energy). Students’ abilities to apply fundamental principles depended on the complexity of structures and processes of the systems. It is suggested that science curriculum incorporate environmental systems and processes as the conditions and processes of scientific event, enabling our students to understand matter transformations in both micro- and macroscopic explanations of scientific processes."
A New Algorithm for Non-Rigid Shape Matching with Anisotropic-Scaling Transformation Parameters,2015,"['Non-rigid matching', 'Anisotropy', 'Scaling transformation', 'Nonlinear least-squares']",,"Three-dimensional (3D) shape matching finds a wide application in manufacturing industry, such as surface inspection, workpiece localization and reverse engineering. In this paper, a new optimization method is proposed for non-rigid shape matching modeling and solving. The point-tangent distance function is used to construct a nonlinear least-squares model for anisotropic non-rigid shape matching, from which 9 variables with respect to non-rigid matching parameters are computed simultaneously by solving a linear system. In order to strengthen the non-rigid matching robustness to potential outliers, the optimization model is improved by an iteratively reweighted method. The typical characteristic is to weaken the influence of outliers during iterations. Finally, experiments are carried out to evaluate and analyze the proposed method, including matching accuracy, efficiency and robustness. Shape matching is also an important task in computer vision (such as face registration and object recognition), and the proposed method can find its application in this field."

Then CCl4 was discontinued and thalidomide (100 mg/kg) or its vehicle was administered daily by gavagefor 6 weeks. Serum hyaluronic acid, laminin, procollagen type III, and collagen type IV were examined by using a radioimmunoassay.Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and α-smooth muscle actin(α-SMA) protein in the liver, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) protein in cytoplasm by using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, and MMP-13, TIMP-1, and TGF-β1 mRNA levels in the liver were studied using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.Results: Liver histopathology was significantly better in rats given thalidomide than in the untreated model group. The levels of TIMP-1 and TGF-β1 mRNA and protein expressions were decreased significantly and MMP-13 mRNA and protein in the liver were significantly elevated in the thalidomide-treated group.Conclusion: Thalidomide may exert its effects on the regulation of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 via inhibition of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, which enhances the degradation of extracellular matrix and accelerates the regression of hepatic cirrhosis in rats."
Rapid selection of theanine-rich green tea (Camellia sinensis L.) trees and metabolites profiling by Fourier transform nearinfrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy,2015,"['Tea tree', 'Theanine', 'Amino acids', 'Ninhydrin', 'Colorimetric method', 'FT-IR']",,"A simple and rapid ninhydrin-based colorimetric method was efficiently developed, and metabolites profiling of tea tree (Camellia sinensis L.) leaf extracts was carried out by Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The tea extracts of Hadong region exhibited a wide range of variations in their theanine contents. In general, theanine and other amino acids were higher in classified theanine-rich lines than that of theanine-poor lines. Among selected theanine-rich lines, the theanine levels reached a maximum of 15.3 mg/g for line TR92, a value 51-fold more than that found in theanine-poor TP23 and TP156 lines. Therefore, ninhydrin-based colorimetric method can be efficiently adopted for the selection of theanine-rich plants thereby enabling selection of plants dependent on their chemical constituents. FT-IR spectroscopy analysis was conducted in 15 tea tree lines as theanine-rich 8 lines and -poor 7 lines. The spectral data were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). PCA and PLS-DA could successfully discriminate theanine-rich and -poor lines. The quantitative prediction modeling of total amino acids and theanine from tea tree leaf lines was established using partial least square regression algorithm from FT-IR spectra. The regression coefficients (R2) between predicted values and estimated values of total amino acids and theanine were 0.976 and 0.992, respectively. These results showed that quantitative predictions of total amino acids and theanine were possible from FT-IR spectra of tea tree leaf lines with higher accuracy. These results suggest that the prediction system established in this study could be applied as a rapid selection of theanine-rich lines of tea tree."

Ten parameters of geomorphological and geological factors wereused as independent variables, and 466 cases (228 non-mobilization cases and 238 mobilization cases) were investigatedfor the statistical analyses. First of all, Fisher’s discriminant function was used for the mobilization criterion. It showed91.6 percent in the accuracy of actual mobilization cases, but homogeneity condition of variance and covariance betweennon-mobilization and mobilization groups was not satisfied, and independent variables did not follow normal distribution,either. Second, binomial logistic analysis was conducted for the mobilization criterion. The result showed 92.3 percentin the accuracy of actual mobilization cases, and all assumptions for the logistic analysis were satisfied. Therefore, itcan be concluded that the mobilization criterion for debris-flow using binomial logistic regression analysis can beeffectively applied for the prediction of debris-flow hazard analysis."

The predictive model is based on ISO 9613-2 standards using the Noble close proximity (NCPX) method and the pass-by method. This means that the use of these standards is a powerful tool for analyzing the traffic noise level because of the strengths of these methods. Traffic noise analysis was performed based on digital signal processing (DSP) for detecting traffic noise with the pass-by method at the test site.METHODS : There are several analysis methods, which are generally divided into three different types, available to evaluate traffic noise predictive models. The first method uses the classification standard of 12 vehicle types. The second method is based on a standard of four vehicle types. The third method is founded on 5 types of vehicles, which are different from the types used by the second method. This means that the second method not only consolidates 12 vehicle types into only four types, but also that the results of the noise analysis of the total traffic volume are reflected in a comparison analysis of the three types of methods. The constant percent bandwidth (CPB) analysis was used to identify the properties of different frequencies in the frequency analysis. A-weighting was applied to the DSP and to the transformation process from analog to digital signal. The root mean squared error (RMSE) was applied to compare and evaluate the predictive model results of the three analysis methods.RESULTS: The result derived from the third method, based on the classification standard of 5 vehicle types, shows the smallest values of RMSE and max and min error. However, it does not have the reduction properties of a predictive model. To evaluate the predictive model of an ANC system, a reduction analysis of the total sound pressure level (TSPL), dB(A), was conducted. As a result, the analysis based on the third method has the smallest value of RMSE and max error. The effect of traffic noise reduction was the greatest value of the types of analysis in this research.CONCLUSIONS : From the results of the error analysis, the application method for categorizing vehicle types related to the 12-vehicle classification based on previous research is appropriate to the ANC system. However, the performance of a predictive model on an ANC system is up to a value of traffic noise reduction. By the same token, the most appropriate method that influences the maximum reduction effect is found in the third method of traffic analysis. This method has a value of traffic noise reduction of 31.28 dB(A). In conclusion, research for detecting the friction noise between a tire and the road surface for the 12 vehicle types needs to be conducted to authentically demonstrate an ANC system in the Republic of Korea."

From this viewpoint, this paper aims to analyze and discuss the merits and demerits of the conscription system and the volunteer system in connection with the strategy of national security. For this reason, this paper utilizes argumentation model suggested by S. E. Toulmin. As the result, the conscription system which can be kept in near future will be gradually transformed into the volunteer system. In the meantime, salaried military personnel system and co-conscription system should be expanded, which can make some by-products minimal. The transformation into the volunteer system can dissolve youth-unemployment and equalization of both sexes and can consider the future strategy of national security for the Unification. The transform into the volunteer system needs some conditions such as the change of recognition of defence policy, the financial support to military services. However, it is necessary to make it public and discussed because it is a kind of solution against future national strategy."

This paper suggests college English be taught following the principles of the transformed flipped learning-teaching skills. When a teacher utilizes printed learning material in a flipped classroom, there are effects as follows: first, students improve self-directed learning capability; second, there is more interaction between teacher and learner; third, students through learner experience-centered learning process attain deeper comprehension of their material; fourth, students expand their metacognition through feedback with their teacher or fellow students.

In addition, the suggestion of the proper and effective models of leadership in each phases of unification has been made. As for the differentiation of the phases of unification process, three sociological terminologies, as transitions, unification and integration, have been utilized to establish the five stages of various boundariness: the old boundarized stages, the out-of-boundary stage, the early integration stage, the new boundarized stages, and the late integration stage. Continuously, the three paradigms for leadership modeling in terms of those stages of unification are proposed: the situational leadership paradigm which requires the variation or relocate the proper leadership style according to the changes of situation, the transformational leadership paradigm which promotes the macro-scaled innovations and transformations in socio-political contexts, and the neo-charisma paradigm which elicits the positive functions of charisma, and which induces the social changes through the frame transformation between the leaders and the followers. Table 1 summarized the characteristics of situation, goals, influences and communication at each unification stages, and suggested the contextualized models of leadership at each five stages of unification: visionary leadership model, charismatic leadership model, connective leadership model, boundary leadership model, and policy-making leadership model. Additionally, those models of leadership for unification have been translated into the Christian perspectives, as prophetic leadership model, transformational charismatic leadership model, priest leadership model, inter-cultural leadership model, and Christian public leadership model. The focus of this article is by priority more upon the introductory suggestions of the contextualized models of leadership for the general situation of Korean unification, rather than upon the analytic approach to the specific leadership models at the specific situation of unification.

Snyder)는 신학교 시절에 배운 “우리가 이미 믿고 있는 것을 확인하기 위해서가 아니라 성경이 실제로 가르치고 있는 것을 찾기 위해, 그것이 우리의 가정을 단단하게 하기도 하고 부수기도 하는” 귀납적 성경연구를 오랫동안 계속해서 추구해왔다 고 한다. 이 글은 필자가 나름대로 변혁적 효과를 탐구하며 그 동안 꾸준히 해온 귀납적 성경연구라는 여행의 발견물의 일부이다. 타문화권 선교는 무엇보다도 어떤 마음과 태도로 선교하느냐, 즉 선교 자세가 가장 중요하다는 필자의 그동안의 지론의 연장선상에 놓인 글이다. 창세기 12장부터 하나님은 인류를 복 주시려는 새롭고도 적극적인 전략을 펼치면서 한 가계를 선택하고 그들에게 집중한다. 창세기 12장 부터는 아브라함과 그의 후손들이 거룩한 역사의 거의 유일한 주제인양 다뤄진다. 아서 글라서(Arthur F. Glasser)는 아브라함이 결과적으로 ‘선교의 선구자’가 되었다고 정리한다. 필자는 이스라엘의 족장 아브라 함과 이삭과 야곱은 타문화권 선교사의 롤 모델, 즉 본보기로서 손색이 없다고 본다. 이 글에서 모델이라는 개념은 스코트 모로(A. Scott Moreau)가 분류한 물질적, 은유적, 이론적이라는 세 가지 범주 가운데 두 번째인 은유적인 용도로 사용한다. 족장들은 타문화권 선교사가 열망하는 하나의 이상이라는 의미에서 모델이 될 수 있다. 고로 족장들 의 삶에서 타문화권 선교사의 본보기를 추출하고자 한다. 그들이 타문 화권 선교사의 전형(典型) 즉 기준이나 규범이 될 수 있다고 보기 때문이다. 이 연구를 통해 필자는 타문화권 선교사의 기준이 될 만한 이론적 틀을 찾아본다. 아브라함에게서는 관계 성공하는 선교사, 이삭에게서는 우물을 넘겨주는 선교사, 야곱에게서는 우물 아귀의 돌을 옮기는 선교사라는 틀을 찾아낸다. 하나님과는 믿음과 순종의 관계를, 현지인 들과는 사랑의 관계를 맺은 아브라함은 가히 타문화권 선교사의 선구자 라 할 만하다. 순종과 양보의 대명사인 이삭의 삶은 이양과 출구전략이라는 측면에서 타문화권 선교사의 훌륭한 교과서로서 손색이 없다. 전략적 계획의 대가로서 타이밍과 목표와 단계적 접근의 중요성을 포괄적으로 잘 활용한 야곱은 타문화권 선교사의 좋은 본보기가 된다. 많은 일을 겪으면서 사는 것에 더해 하나님의 일을 해야 하는 타문화권 선교사가, 삼대에 걸쳐 창세기를 아름답게 수놓은 족장들인 아브라함과 이삭과 야곱이 밟아 마침내 길이 된 타문화권 선교라는 지난한 길을 잘 걸어가는 모습을 그려본다.","Howard A. Snyder is said to have continuously pursued inductive Bible study reflected in the sentence “We study the Bible not to confirm what we already believe but to find out what it actually teaches, whether that cements or shatters our assumptions,” learned when he was a seminary student. This paper is a piece of the treasure discovered in the author’s continuous journey of inductive Bible study and research in transformative effects. The paper is an extension of the author’s long-lived assertion that the attitude of the missionary is the most important factor in cross-cultural mission. Starting from Genesis 12, God chooses and focuses on one household as a novel and active strategy to bless mankind. From Genesis 12, Abraham and his descendents are nearly the sole subjects of God’s holy history.Arthur F. Glasser proposed that in the end, Abraham became the pioneer in mission. The author further takes this idea and claims that the patriarchs of the Israelite clan, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are excellent role models of cross-cultural mission. In this paper, the concept of “model,” which is classified by A. Scott Moreau as physical, metaphoric, and theoretical, is used in the context of a metaphoric model. The patriarchs are models in the sense that they are aspired by cross-cultural missionaries as a certain ideal. Therefore, an effort is made to extract the examples of being a cross-cultural missionary from the lives of the patriarchs. This is because they are recognized as the model, in other words the standard or the criterion, of cross-cultural missionaries. Through this study, the author finds the theoretical framework of the standards for cross-cultural missionaries: from Abraham, the relationship-succeeding missionary, from Isaac, the well-transferring missionary, from Jacob, the missionary that moved the stone from the mouth of the well. Abraham, who sustained a relationship based on faith and obedience with God and a relationship based on love with the indigenous people, is worthy of being called the pioneer of cross-cultural mission. Isaac, acclaimed for his obedience and concession, is a textbook example of cross-cultural mission in the aspects of transfer and exit strategy. Jacob is also a good model for cross-cultural missionaries in terms of his strategic planning in which the importance of timing, setting goals, and having a phased approach are comprehensively utilized. The author depicts a picture in which cross-cultural missionaries, who must do the work of God while facing many challenges in life, skillfully walk the difficult road paved by the three generations of patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that beautifully embroidered the book of Genesis."

A modeling-based learning program was implemented in two classes of the experimental group, and teacher-centered traditional classes were carried out for the other students in the comparison group. Science achievement scores and the distribution of students`` mental models in experimental and comparison groups were quantitatively compared. The video-taped transcripts of five teams’ argumentation were qualitatively analyzed based on the analytic framework developed in the study. The analytic framework for coding students’ argumentation in the modeling-based learning was composed of five components of TAP and the corresponding components containing alternative concepts. The results suggest that the frequencies of causal two-dimensional model and cubic model were high in the experimental group, while the frequencies of simple two-dimensional model and simple cross sectional model were high in the comparison group. The higher the frequency of claims, an argumentation pattern was proven successful, and the level of mental model was higher. After the rebuttal was suggested, students observed the model again and claimed again according to new data. Therefore, the model could be confirmed as having a positive impact on students`` argumentation process."

As a result of distinct characteristics of China’s social and historical development, over the years two forms of automotive company have emerged in China: one being Chinese-multinational joint ventures and the other, local automakers that started with their own capital. After China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, China’s automotive sales volume has maintained first place in the world for consecutive years. Over the years of this transformation, China’s automotive market has been influenced by both internal factors such as domestic policies as well as external elements concerned with significant changes of the global automobile industry.  This study aims to provide a deeper insight to the growth of domestically developed SUV models in China. This paper extends the research focus to analyzing the design elements that influence the development of domestic SUV models.

Regression model, as one of the most widely used in statistical tools, so they can utilize various forms of materials in accordance with these requirements, changes to via a different distribution or transformation. This study proposes a regression model using the mixture distribution to fit the proportion data of semi-continuous type, which has a probability mass in a certain discrete values, and estimation method based on maximum quasi-likelihood. Most regression models for the proportion data have used a data transformation, such as a logit transformation, for the response variable and a likelihood estimation based on distribution suitable for the proportion. But it is difficult for these models to apply semi-continuous proportion data, since distributional assumptions are not acceptable. As result, it is likely that the most regression models cannot provide the exact statistical inference. Through the empirical study, the proposed model shows that results for the estimates and fit statistics have no difference with others. Furthermore, it is possible to identify a characteristic with the proposed model, which the other models cannot clarify."

Material properties of the nanobeam are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction according to a novel exponential distribution law in terms of the volume fractions of the metal and ceramic constituents. The upper surface of the functionally graded (FG) nanobeam is pure ceramic whereas the lower surface is pure metal. A nonlocal generalized thermoelasticity theory with dual-phase-lag (DPL) model is used to solve this problem. The theories of coupled thermoelasticity, generalized thermoelasticity with one relaxation time, and without energy dissipation can extracted as limited and special cases of the present model. An analytical technique based on Laplace transform is used to calculate the variation of deflection and temperature. The inverse of Laplace transforms are computed numerically using Fourier expansion techniques. The effects of the phase-lags (PLs), nonlocal parameter and the angular frequency of oscillation of the heat flux on the lateral vibration, the temperature, and the axial displacement of the nanobeam are studied."

The isolated gene was cloned into pPha-T1 vector containing fcpA promoter to prepare pPha-T1-HDR plasmid. As a positive control, pPha-T1-eGFP plasmid was constructed with egfp gene. Stable nuclear transformation was carried out with these plasmids by particle bombardment method and zeocin resistant colonies of P. tricornutum were selected on f/2 agar plate. In result, transformation efficiency was evaluated according to the amount of plasmid DNA coated with gold particles. Integration of introduced plasmids was confirmed with genomic DNA of each transformant by polymerase chain reaction. The eGFP fluorescence was visible in the cytoplasm, indicating that eGFP was successively expressed in P. tricornutum system. The transcript level of exogenous Pthdr gene was evaluated with the obtained transformants.

A fuzzy residual strength based fatigue life prediction method,2015,"['fatigue life', 'residual strength', 'fuzzy model', 'reliability']",,"The fatigue damage problems are frequently encountered in the design of civil engineering structures. A realistic and accurate fatigue life prediction is quite essential to ensure the safety of engineering design. However, constructing a reliable fatigue life prediction model can be quite challenging. The use of traditional deterministic approach in predicting the fatigue life is sometimes too dangerous in the real practical designs as the method itself contains a wide range of uncertain factors. In this paper, a new fatigue life prediction method is going to be proposed where the residual strength is been utilized. Several cumulative damage models, capable of predicting the fatigue life of a structural element, are considered. Based on Miner's rule, a randomized approach is developed from a deterministic equation. The residual strength is used in a one to one transformation methodology which is used for the derivation of the fatigue life. To arrive at more robust results, fuzzy sets are introduced to model the parameter uncertainties. This leads to a convoluted fuzzy based fatigue life prediction model. The developed model is illustrated in an example analysis. The calculated results are compared with real experimental data. The applicability of this approach for a required reliability level is also discussed."

The Bible shows that Abraham became a rich, respected powerful leader by God""s blessing. He was also accredited as “a mighty prince” who had God’s authority. Furthermore, the story leads to the change of Abraham""s attitude, until “bowing down before the Hitties""(Gen 23:7,12). Such a transforming story can be regarded as an essential goal of God""s blessing, the humbleness and love to other cultures.  This paper suggests Abraham as a model of spiritual journey for Korean churches and Christians. Christianity is chiefly relationship-based as that the creed of trinity implies the relational love between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Christian mission is to cross barriers to other peoples with love. In another word, Christians must intentionally enlarge their love to other culture nations. Today’s churches and Christians in Korea must focus on the relationship- based spirituality.  Therefore, Abraham can be suggested as the model of a relationally and spiritually grown leader for today’s Christians. The Bible shows that God used “hidden three curriculum,” that is faith-training(love-God), relationship-training(loveneighbors), and intercultural training(love-all-nations). As Abraham""s journey instructs us, today, Korean churches and Christians need to seek to those three training factors for the spiritual growth. Thus, ""intercultural transformation,"" which this writing highly notes, can contribute to the coming multicultural situation in Korea, not only as one of the core of Christian values but also as the basis of faithful spirituality."

In this study, wind force coefficients are determined by conducting wind tunnel test on 13 types electric pole models. As the results of these, representative 4 types of pole shape and wind force coefficients of each shape are suggested.

The predictive model is based on ISO 9613-2 standards using the Noble close proximity (NCPX) method and the pass-by method. This means that the use of these standards is a powerful tool for analyzing the traffic noise level because of the strengths of these methods. Traffic noise analysis was performed based on digital signal processing (DSP) for detecting traffic noise with the pass-by method at the test site. METHODS : There are several analysis methods, which are generally divided into three different types, available to evaluate traffic noise predictive models. The first method uses the classification standard of 12 vehicle types. The second method is based on a standard of four vehicle types. The third method is founded on 5 types of vehicles, which are different from the types used by the second method. This means that the second method not only consolidates 12 vehicle types into only four types, but also that the results of the noise analysis of the total traffic volume are reflected in a comparison analysis of the three types of methods. The constant percent bandwidth (CPB) analysis was used to identify the properties of different frequencies in the frequency analysis. A-weighting was applied to the DSP and to the transformation process from analog to digital signal. The root mean squared error (RMSE) was applied to compare and evaluate the predictive model results of the three analysis methods. RESULTS: The result derived from the third method, based on the classification standard of 5 vehicle types, shows the smallest values of RMSE and max and min error. However, it does not have the reduction properties of a predictive model. To evaluate the predictive model of an ANC system, a reduction analysis of the total sound pressure level (TSPL), dB(A), was conducted. As a result, the analysis based on the third method has the smallest value of RMSE and max error. The effect of traffic noise reduction was the greatest value of the types of analysis in this research. CONCLUSIONS : From the results of the error analysis, the application method for categorizing vehicle types related to the 12-vehicle classification based on previous research is appropriate to the ANC system. However, the performance of a predictive model on an ANC system is up to a value of traffic noise reduction. By the same token, the most appropriate method that influences the maximum reduction effect is found in the third method of traffic analysis. This method has a value of traffic noise reduction of 31.28 dB(A). In conclusion, research for detecting the friction noise between a tire and the road surface for the 12 vehicle types needs to be conducted to authentically demonstrate an ANC system in the Republic of Korea."

Priestly Formation in Indian Context: A New Pedagogy for Integral Formation of Candidates to Priesthood in India,2015,"['Integration', 'Internalization', 'Transformation', 'Induction', 'Prophet-mystic', '통합', '내면화', '변화', '귀납', '예언자-신비가.']",,"“Filii tui India, administri tibi salutis” (Your own sons, O India, will be the heralds of your salvation). These are the words with which Pope Leo XIII, a great visionary and a missionary, established the Papal Seminary for India, Burma and Ceylon in 1890. These prophetic words of Pope Leo XIII, of Rerum Novarum fame have indeed become a reality in the fact today India can boast of 170 dioceses with over 200 bishops and nearly 20,000 priests and over one lakh twenty five thousand religious women and men rendering yeomen service to the people of India. What is also very consoling and encouraging is the fact that for the past two decades a number of Indian priests and religious are serving as missionaries in the continents of Africa, South and Central Americas, Oceania and Europe. Our seminaries and formation houses still attract a fairly good number of young men and women and that too when demographically the families in India are increasingly becoming smaller and nuclear. Although numerically Christians are just 2% of the total population of India (around 25 million in a total population of 125 crores) the service rendered by the Church in India in the field of education, medical and social work is quite significant and laudable, a fact that is often publicly acknowledged and recognized by the Government of India.India today has one of the fastest growing economies of the world and is making tremendous progress in manufacturing industries, information technology, bio technology, nuclear energy, etc. The urbanization and globalization is presently sweeping through the Indian sub-continent with an accelerated speed. This has undoubtedly brought about rapid sociocultural and economic changes in the Indian society. The priestly formation on the other hand still continues on the Tridentine model that is obsolete in many ways and fails to address the challenges and needs of modern India. Hence the need is urgent for a new pedagogy for Integral Formation of candidates to priesthood in India.The need of the hour is to train the candidates to priesthood to become ‘mystics’ in keeping with the ancient and much revered religious tradition of India on the one hand and on the other to be ‘prophets’ in the midst of massive poverty, socio-economic and cultural disparities, dehumanizing injustice and exploitation of all kinds, gender inequality, communal disharmony, etc. Given this context of India, there is definitely a need for a paradigm shift in the pedagogy for the training of candidates to priesthood in India today. The existing priestly formation seems to be very much church centered with over-emphasis on cultic and ritualistic piety, conformism to external rules and regulations, fulfilling the academic requirements of the syllabus. More stress on content and external structures and very little attention to the process of transformation. And therefore it is imperative to evolve a new pedagogy that is integral and holistic in order to equip the candidates, the future leaders of the Church in India with experiential knowledge and skills that could gradually transform their personality as Disciples of Christ, men imbued with deep Christian faith, men of moral and spiritual integrity, men of affective maturity, men who are professionally competent in matters of religion, morality and spirituality. To sum up therefore the goal of Integral formation is to facilitate a process of transformation whereby the candidates become passionate lovers of Christ for compassionate service of God’s people."

First, a technique was examined to detect wet surfaces at nighttime. From the literature reviews, it was revealed that image processing using polarization is one of the preferred options. However, it is hard to use the polarization characteristics of road surface images at nighttime because of irregular or no light situations. In this study, we proposes a new discriminant for detecting wet and dry road surfaces using CCTV image data at night. To detect the road surface conditions with night vision, we applied the wavelet packet transform for analyzing road surface textures. Additionally, to apply the luminance feature of night CCTV images, we set the intensity histogram based on HSI(Hue Saturation Intensity) color model. With a set of 200 images taken from the field, we constructed a detection criteria hyperplane with SVM (Support Vector Machine). We conducted field tests to verify the detection ability of the wet road surfaces and obtained reliable results. The outcome of this study is also expected to be used for monitoring road surfaces to improve safety."

To verify the result from a finite element analysis, a two-dimensional Mo substrate was calculated and its verification experiment was conducted. The absolute values from the finite element analysis of Mo/substrate structure and its verification experiment showed a difference. However, the size of residual stress of individual substrate compositions had a similar tendency. Two-dimensional CIGS/Mo/SiO₂/substrate was modeled. Looking into the residual stress of CIGS layer occurred while the temperature declined from 550℃ to room temperature, the smallest residual stress was found with the use of Fe-52 wt%Ni substrate material."

In particular, the noisy signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to obtain intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) plus a residue. Then, each IMF is denoised by using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) thresholding technique. Finally, the denoised signal is recovered by performing a weighted summation of the denoised IMFs except the residue. The weights are determined by estimating a constrained least squares coefficients; where, the sum of the coefficients is constrained to unity. We used human ECG and EEG signals, and also two EEG signals from left and right cortex of two healthy adult rats.Results The 36 experimental results show that the proposed EMD-DWT-CLS provides higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and lower mean of squared errors (MSE) than the classical EMD-DWT model.Conclusions Based on comparison with classical EMDDWT model used in the literature, the proposed approach was found to be effective in human and animal physiological signals denoising."

In the proposed control strategy, a virtual resistance based on the capacitor voltage feedback is used to realize the active damping. In addition, the proportional resonant (PR) controller under the two-phase stationary coordinate is designed to track the ac reference current and to avoid the strong coupling brought about by the coordinate transformation. The limitations on improving steady-state performance of the PR controller is investigated and mitigated using a cascaded lead-lag compensator. In the z-domain, a straightforward procedure is developed to analyze and design the control-loop with the help of MATLAB/SISO software tools. In addition, robustness against parameter variations is analyzed. Finally, simulation and experimental results verify the proposed control scheme and design method."
가우시안 군집분석을 이용한 천리안 위성의 대기운동벡터 표적추적 알고리듬 개발 및 분석,2015,"['Atmospheric motion vector', 'target search', 'COMS', 'gaussian mixture model']",,"Atmospheric Motion Vector (AMV) from satellite images have shown Slow Speed Bias (SSB) in comparison with rawinsonde. The causes of SSB are originated from tracking, selection, and height assignment error, which is known to be the leading error. However, recent works have shown that height assignment error cannot be fully explained the cause of SSB. This paper attempts a new approach to examine the possibility of SSB reduction of COMS AMV by using a new target tracking algorithm. Tracking error can be caused by averaging of various wind patterns within a target and changing of cloud shape in searching process over time. To overcome this problem, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) has been adopted to extract the coldest cluster as target since the shape of such target is less subject to transformation. Then, an image filtering scheme is applied to weigh more on the selected coldest pixels than the other, which makes it easy to track the target. When AMV derived from our algorithm with sum of squared distance method and current COMS are compared with rawindsonde, our products show noticeable improvement over COMS products in mean wind speed by an increase of 2.7 ms_1 and SSB reduction by 29%. However, the statistics regarding the bias show negative impact for mid/low level with our algorithm, and the number of vectors are reduced by 40% relative to COMS. Therefore, further study is required to improve accuracy for mid/low level winds and increase the number of AMV vectors."

Response surface method (RSM) was introduced as a design of experiment, and the database for RSM was set with the numerical simulation of DTF. The dependent variables such as burnout ratios (BOR) of coal and CO/CO2 ratios were mathematically described as a function of three independent variables (coal particle size, carrier gas flow rate, wall temperature) being modeled by the use of the central composite design (CCD), and evaluated using a second-order polynomial multiple regression model. The prediction of BOR showed a high coefficient of determination (R2) value, thus ensuring a satisfactory adjustment of the second-order polynomial multiple regression model with the simulation data. However, CO/CO2ratio had a big difference between calculated values and predicted values using conventional RSM, which might be mainly due to the dependent variable increses or decrease very steeply, and hence the second order polynomial cannot follow the rates. To relax the increasing rate of dependent variable, CO/CO2 ratio was taken as common logarithms and worked again with RSM. The application of logarithms in the transformation of dependent variables showed that the accuracy was highly enhanced and predicted the simulation data well."
Study on Curing Behaviors of Epoxy Acrylates by UV with and without Aromatic Component,2015,"['epoxy acrylate', 'UV curing', 'cure kinetics', 'autocatalysis', 'time-temperature-transformation diagram']",,"Two kinds of epoxy acrylates, aromatic BAGEDA (bisphenol A diglycidyl ether diacrylate) and aliphatic BDGEDA (1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether diacrylate), were prepared from BADGE (bisphenol A diglycidyl ether) and BDDGE (1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether) respectively by reacting with acrylic acid. Synthesis and change in functional groups were confirmed by FTIR spectra. In the studies of UV curing behaviors by Photo-DSC (differential photocalorimetry), rate constants and conversions under isothermal conditions (Tcure=30-80 oC) were determined by exothermic heat flows. Thus, maximum reaction rates of BAGEDA and BDGEDA were 4.06×10-2 s-1 and 5.01×10-2 s-1 respectively. UV curing behaviors were confirmed to follow Kamal equation model. Activation energies were 23.5 kJ/mol (Ea1) and 12.0 kJ/mol (Ea2) for BAGEDA, and 25.0 kJ/mol (Ea1) and 11.3 kJ/mol (Ea2) for BDGEDA. In the UV curing reaction of BAGEDA, the maximum reaction rate constants and conversions were increased by increasing reaction temperatures (Tcure), while in that of BDGEDA those were increased until 60 oC followed by a gradual decrease above 60 oC.

As a Confucianist, Kim Yunsik adopted a reform model, that of the late Qing dynasty’s Self-Strengthening Movement (洋務運動), by which Kim pursued Chos?n’s wealth and power with the idea of prolonging the traditional dynastic state and the Confucian state political system. His foreign policy in relation to China, during the same period, was based on the concept of “vassal but autonomous state” (屬邦自主). Kim tried to improve Chos?n’s statesecurity by utilizing the traditional tributary relationship with China. His strategy represented Chos?n’s typical stance which gave top priority to its diplomatic relations with China, the sole superpower in East Asia. However, the defeat of China in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 made Chos?n’s ruling elites deliberate on the autonomy of Korea not from China but as a modern sovereign nation. Even the Confucianists came to recognize that true autonomy was possible only with political independence and sovereignty. At the same time, the concept of sovereignty opened the way for constitutionalism in that it allowed for political legitimacy not in the investiture system but as a sovereign state. To sum up, the transformation from the traditional Confucian state to the modern sovereign state was an essential prerequisite for Choso˘n’s survival and prosperity in the modern era, and the Gabo Reform, although a failed attempt, provided a chance for such transformation."
Research on the Critical Condition of Brittle-Ductile Transition about Micro-Milling of KDP Crystal and Experimental Verification,2015,"['KDP crystal', 'Brittle-ductile transition', 'Micro-milling', 'Hertz model']",,"KDP crystal is a kind of brittle material, and improper selection of processing parameter can easily result in brittle domain cuttingof KDP crystal. Determining the critical cutting depth of micro-milling brittle-ductile transition of KDP crystal can guide the selectionof process parameters. The elastic-plastic contact formula of blunt spherical indenter and brittle materials is used to explicate thecontact of micro-cutter edge and brittle materials. Combined with indentation critical load equation, the calculation model ofpredicting the critical cutting depth is established. The critical cutting depth is the function of material properties of the workpiece,the tool material properties and the tool edge radius. The edge radius of CBN flat end milling cutter is measured by atomic forcemicroscopy, and then the critical cutting depth of the KDP crystal material is calculated as 230 nm. By using this milling cutter, microgroovemilling experiments are conducted with different spindle speeds and feeds. The results demonstrate that as the spindle speedincreases, the micro-groove bottom surface gradually transformed from the brittle cutting state to plastic cutting state. The criticalspindle speed is 30000 rpm, and the maximum deformed cutting thickness is 227 nm, which coincides with the result of the theoreticalcalculation model."

A Theoretical Framework for Closeness Centralization Measurements in a Workflow-Supported Organization,2015,"['workflow-supported org-social network (WsoN)', 'information control net (ICN)', 'closeness centralization measures/vector (CCV)', 'workflow model', 'organizational knowledge management', 'workflow intelligence']",,"In this paper, we build a theoretical framework for quantitatively measuring and graphically representing the degrees of closeness centralization among performers assigned to enact a workflow procedure. The degree of closeness centralization of a workflow-performer reflects how near the performer is to the other performers in enacting a corresponding workflow model designed for workflow-supported organizational operations. The proposed framework comprises three procedural phases and four functional transformations, such as discovery, analysis, and quantitation phases, which carry out ICN-to-WsoN, WsoN-to-SocioMatrix, SocioMatrix-to-DistanceMatrix, and DistanceMatrix-to-CCV transformations. We develop a series of algorithmic formalisms for the procedural phases and their transformative functionalities, and verify the proposed framework through an operational example. Finally, we expatiate on the functional expansion of the closeness centralization formulas so as for the theoretical framework to handle a group of workflow procedures (or a workflow package) with organization-wide workflow-performers."
The Paradoxes in Globalization’s Economic Empowerment of South Korea,2015,"['development state', 'economic development', 'globalization', 'neoliberalism', 'South Korea', 'jaebeol']",,"From a broad perspective, South Korea’s “Miracle on the Han River” appears quite miraculous. Economically, South Korea was transformed from one of the poorest nations in the world at the end of the Korean War to a developed nation in the early twenty-first century. The growing globalization of the world economy clearly empowered South Korea as growing integration into the world economy was the centerpiece of the nation’s economic developmental strategy. Yet, Korea’s rapid growth and industrial transformation appear paradoxical in several key regards. First, an economic miracle should produce a satisfied and grateful population, but most leading politicians and the country’s leading economic and political institutions have been fairly unpopular during most of South Korea’s postwar history. Second, the South Korean experience crosscuts the normal debate in development studies, which conflates globalization and neoliberalism. Third, South Korea’s widely vaunted developmental state in the 1960s and 1970s in reality departed quite significantly from the developmental state model. Finally, South Korea’s attempts to promote its integration into the global economy during the post-developmental state period produced several sets of contradictory effects."

In fact, there has been conflict over the medical jurisdiction between western and oriental medical doctors since the Independence. While the western medical doctors has tried to maintain monopolistic control over the medicine since the Independence, it was not that much successful due to the fact that the oriental medical doctor were successfully managing the entrance of official medical jurisdiction and expanding their practices. That means western doctors were failing to establish the unified health care system. If so, it might be interesting to ask of how the oriental medical doctors have expanded their jurisdiction over the health care system and become a medical professional.The historical change of occupational works shows some aspects of professional establishment by the oriental medical doctor. Mode of medical practice, perception by the people, historical operation by oriental medical doctors and the change in the contents of medical practice in a broader sense are among those. In other words, the process of the emergence of oriental medical profession might be explained from the perspective of the combined interaction of collective action and surrounding social circumstances. The intention of the paper is to display the process of how the traditional oriental medical occupation is experiencing its transformation into the professional. For the purpose, the jurisdictional conflicts in the areas of institution, public opinion and practice are analyzed since the Independence by utilizing the professional system model."

The prepared lanthanum-modified diatomite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that lanthanum was successfully immobilized onto diatomite, with a content of lanthanum element of about 1.5% (atomic ratio). The prepared adsorbent was evaluated for the adsorptive removal of tetracycline, and the adsorption isotherm, kinetics and mechanism were investigated. The adsorbent exhibited higher adsorption capacity than other adsorbents reported in literature, reaching 1056.9mmol/kg. Langmuir model better fitted the experimental data than did other models. The removal of tetracycline was favorable at near neutral pH conditions. The tetracycline adsorption well followed pseudo-second-order kinetics model, and most of tetracycline was adsorbed within the initial 15 min. The increase in ionic strength reduced the tetracycline adsorptive removal, indicating that tetracycline adsorption on La-modified diatomite may be attributed to the formation of out-sphere surface complexes."
Baicalin attenuates TNBS-induced colitis in rats by modulating the Th17/Treg paradigm,2015,"['Inflammatory bowel disease', 'Baicalin', 'Th17 cells', 'Regulatory T cells']",,"Baicalin, a flavonoid, has a wide range ofpharmacological properties, including immunomodulation.The objective of this study was to investigate the effect ofbaicalin on the balance of T helper 17 (Th17) and regulatoryT (Treg) cells in a colitis model. The rat colitis modelwas induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid(TNBS). Baicalin (10 ml/kg, each) or mesalazine (positivecontrol) was then administered orally for 7 days. Inflammatoryand immunological responses were evaluated bypathology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, real-timepolymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, and flowcytometry. Our study showed that baicalin not only significantlyattenuated TNBS-induced colitis by reducing thedisease activity index as well as macroscopic and microscopicscores, but it also improved the weight loss andshortening of the colon. Baicalin treatment also induced asignificant decrease in the levels of inflammatory mediators,including the myeloperoxidase activity, the levels oftumor necrosis factor a, IL-1b, and Th1-related cytokinesIL-12 and IFN-c. Furthermore, the beneficial effects ofbaicalin seem to be associated with regulation of the Th17and Treg paradigm. We found that administration ofbaicalin significantly downregulated the number of Th17cells and the levels of Th17-related cytokines (IL-17 andIL-6) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor ct.In contrast, there was an increase in Treg cells numbers,Treg-related cytokines transforming growth factor-b andIL-10, and forkhead box P3. Our results suggest that theanti-inflammatory effect of baicalin may be linked tomodulation of the balance between Th17 and Treg cells inTNBS-induced ulcerative colitis."

The results composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-raydiffraction (XRD), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and vibrating samplemagnetometer (VSM). The results demonstrated that MMIS possesses porous spherical morphology, and exhibits goodthermal stability and magnetic property (Ms=10.14 emu g−1). Then batch mode of binding experiments was used todetermine the equilibrium, kinetics and selectivity recognition. The Langmuir isotherm model fitted the equilibriumdata better than did the Freundlich model, and the maximum adsorption capacity on MMIS was about 1.7 times higherthan that of MNIS. Kinetics behaviors of MMIS were well described by the pseudo-second-order model. MMIS possessedoutstanding selectivity recognition for 2,4,6-TCP in the presence of other competitive phenols (such as sesamol,3-CP, thymol, 2,4-DCP). Furthermore, the reusability performance of MMIS showed about 17.53% loss after five repeatedcycles. Finally, the MMIS were successfully applied to the selective extraction of 2,4,6-TCP from the vegetablesamples."

The modified biomass was freeze dried and utilized as a biosorbent for the removal of Ni(II) from aqueous solution. The physicochemical properties of the biosorbent were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Batch experiments were carried out as a function of contact time (0-60 min), pH (2 to 8), adsorbent dosage (25-150 mg), and initial Ni(II) concentration (25-125 mg/L). The results indicate that surface modified biosorbent effectively adsorbed (9.5 mg/0.1 g biomass) Ni(II) present in the solution. The equilibrium adsorption data were modeled with different kinetic and isotherm models. The Ni(II) adsorption followed pseudo-first-order kinetics (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.998) and Langmuir isotherm (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.994) model. Hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups present in biomass play a major role in the adsorption of Ni(II). The adsorbed Ni(II) from the biosorbent was successfully desorbed (85%) by 1M HCl.

The properties of viscoelastic materials present strong non-linear characteristics in the time, temperature andfrequency domains. The objective is to explore the possibility of having a rational understanding of the complex response. The neuralnetwork technique is thus implemented for this purpose. This study presents the differential constitutive equations of viscoelastic materialsbased on the generalized Kelvin model. The viscoelastic response Laplace transform equations of the sleeve structure are derivedunder the condition of plane strain according to the boundary conditions of the viscoelastic sleeve. The orthogonal design test results ofviscoelastic numerical calculations are normalized and trained using a three-layer BP neural network. The trained network can easilyrealize the mapping of the viscoelastic material test set. Simulation results show that the neural network test and numerical solution resultsare close to each other, and the maximum error of all variables is less than 2.8 percent. The results obtained in this research revealthat the neural network technique has a suitable capability in establishing correlations among different loads and corresponding viscoelasticresponses. The developed neural network model can effectively solve the non-linear problems of viscoelastic structures."

A delayed introduction of this post to the Korean public producing theatre in the late 1990s was accompanied by scant understanding of the post itself as well as its leadership responsibility. As it was repeatedly evidenced in the preceding governance structures of the NTOK(National Theatre of Korea), the former umbrella organization of the NTCK(National Theatre Company of Korea), the position itself underwent a series of odd transformation. From the first combined title of the Company Head cum Artistic Director to the duel leadership of the two positions in parallel, and finally to the latter``s sole leadership in the 2000s, this position appeared to have been destined to change forever its professional identity. Throughout this long transitional years, Artistic Director``s leadership responsibility was largely limited to the selection of programmes and the season planning. Later when the NTCK became an independent organization in 2010, general perception for this position was ameliorated, allowing for the Artistic Director to take in full charge of his/her rightful leadership of the whole institution, including the administrative aspects. Yet little or no discerning attempt has been, on the part of the concerned Ministry of Culture or any public agency, made so far to clarify this post by specifying the Artistic Director``s professional identity, function, and the overall leadership responsibility. This has been one of the essential causes for those incessant controversies over the appointment of the Artistic Director in the Koran public performing arts institutions in recent years. Pondering on such a background, this paper is intended to explore the state and condition of the Artistic Directorship in the Korean public producing theatre institution as represented by the NTCK, and to suggest an alternative scheme for improvement. Along with the historical and conceptual consideration of the Artistic Directorship in the beginning chapters, those practices of the representative state institutions, the NT, England and the NTCK as either an international instance or the Korean model, are speculated in parallel for both comparison and contrast in the main body of the paper. With the indication of the problems, suggestions in the form of a proposal are, in place of the conclusion, made for practical application."
Removal of haloacetonitrile by adsorption on thiol-functionalized mesoporous composites based on natural rubber and hexagonal mesoporous silica,2015,"['Adsorption', 'Composite material', 'Haloacetonitrile']",,"Haloacetonitriles (HANs) are nitrogenous disinfection by-products (DBPs) that have been reported to have a higher toxicity than the other groups of DBPs. The adsorption process is mostly used to remove HANs in aqueous solutions. Functionalized composite materials tend to be effective adsorbents due to their hydrophobicity and specific adsorptive mechanism. In this study, the removal of dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) from tap water by adsorption on thiol-functionalized mesoporous composites made from natural rubber (NR) and hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS-SH) was investigated. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results revealed that the thiol group of NR/HMS was covered with NR molecules. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated an expansion of the hexagonal unit cell. Adsorption kinetic and isotherm models were used to determine the adsorption mechanisms and the experiments revealed that NR/HMS-SH had a higher DCAN adsorption capacity than powered activated carbon (PAC). NR/HMS-SH adsorption reached equilibrium after 12 hours and its adsorption kinetics fit well with a pseudo-second-order model. A linear model was found to fit well with the DCAN adsorption isotherm at a low concentration level."

Uniform beads buoyant up to 24 h wereformed with rough surface and porous internal structure.Characterization by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,differential scanning calorimetry, thermo-gravimetricanalysis and powder x-ray diffractometry suggested anexcellent compatibility of drug with excipients and formulationprocess. The effect of selected independentvariables [amount of sodium alginate (X1), myristyl alcohol(X2) and cefdinir (X3) each at three levels] on thedependent variables [density (Y1), entrapment efficiency(Y2), time to release 20 % (Y3), cumulative percentage ofcefdinir released at 12th hour (Y4) and dissolution efficiency(Y5)] were studied using regression equations andresponse surface plots. The predicted and adjusted r² valueswere in reasonable agreement and the models weresignificant with p＜0.05. Criteria were set for eachresponses and optimized formulation was preparedaccording to the software determined levels. The predictedand observed responses were in good agreement with lowpercent bias errors (＜10 %), marking the validity of thedeveloped model. Thus, cefdinir loaded, extended release,intra-gastric floating gel beads of calcium alginate wereformulated and optimized."
Pricing the Options in Housing Contracts and Risk Management,2015,"['Global Financial Crisis', 'House Price Index Derivatives', 'Risk Management', '글로벌 금융위기', '주택가격지수 파생상품', '위험관리']",,"The recent global financial crisis has hampered economic activities in many ways; however, the impact on the real estate market has been particularly huge. In Korea, falling real estate prices has meant many construction companies going bankrupt because of the vast number of unsold apartments. To alleviate this problem, construction companies have begun to provide potential apartment buyers with free options such as the withdrawal guarantee option, principal guarantee option, premium guarantee option, and buy-back option. In this study, we attempt to analyze the real value and the market risk of these options which has no market value yet. To price the options, we used GARCH option pricing model and Esscher transform. As the result, the price of the withdrawal guarantee option was significantly higher than the other options, and this fact implies that this option may be attractive to the investor in terms of marketing, while the construction firms as issuer may pay the costs. In addition, we applied the DD(Default to Distance) of two companies and VaR of the options in order to manage the risk caused by the options. As the result, according to the analysis of the DD, the issue of the options seems to be helpful to the company immediately. According to the VaR analysis, the principal guarantee option is the most risky option among the options by falling the value of the asset and the value of the option in depressing markets."
Regularized Multichannel Blind Deconvolution Using Alternating Minimization,2015,[],,"Regularized Blind Deconvolution is a problem applicable in degraded images in order to bring the original image out of blur. Multichannel blind Deconvolution considered as an optimization problem. Each step in the optimization is considered as variable splitting problem using an algorithm called Alternating Minimization Algorithm. Each Step in the Variable splitting undergoes Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) / Bregman Iterative method. Regularization is used where an ill posed problem converted into a well posed problem. Two well known regularizers are Tikhonov class and Total Variation (TV) / L2 model. TV can be isotropic and anisotropic, where isotropic for L2 norm and anisotropic for L1 norm. Based on many probabilistic model and Fourier Transforms Image deblurring can be solved. Here in this paper to improve the performance, we have used an adaptive regularization filtering and isotropic TV model Lp norm. Image deblurring is applicable in the areas such as medical image sensing, astrophotography, traffic signal monitoring, remote sensors, case investigation and even images that are taken using a digital camera / mobile cameras."

In doing so, the study utilized secondary teacher-, principal-, and school survey data from the second year of 2012 Gyeonggi Education Panel Study and applied to a two-level Hierarchical Linear Model. Among teacher characteristics, the study found that male teachers, head and master teachers, and teachers who wanted to work at the present school were more likely to agree with principals on school management practices. In addition, teacher efficacy were positively associated with agreement between teachers and principals. Among school characteristics, principals who knew well local and national educational policies and innovation-oriented schools were less likely to be in an agreement with their teachers on school management, while openness of school climate was positively related to teacher-principal agreement. Based on these findings, the study suggested that school management practices should be transformed in a way to enhance autonomy and professionalism of teachers, diagnostic tools of school organizational culture should be developed and disseminated, and further principals should hold consultations with teachers before introducing and implementing school policies."
고밀도폴리에틸렌 소재의 열 열화 특성,2015,"['high density polyethylene', 'thermal degradation', 'oxidation', 'accelerated life test', 'lifetime prediction']",,"The effect of thermal exposure time on mechanical and thermal property behaviors of high density polyethylene (HDPE) used for plastic pallet under an outdoor environment condition has been investigated. As the thermal exposure time is increased, a proportional increase until 36 weeks in tensile strength is observed, while an increasing tendency in impact strength at the early stage of thermal degradation and then a drastic decrease after 27 weeks are shown. These results can be explained by the increases of chain entanglement and crystallinity at the early stage, followed by the increase of crosslinking density, chain scission and the decrease in chain mobility at the late stage of degradation, due to thermal oxidation. Microscopic observation using digital microscope indicates the increases of micro-crack and surface roughness as thermal oxidation makes a progress. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy result suggests the increase of carbonyl index value on the surface of thermally exposed HDPE, indicating that the hydrocarbon groups on the HDPE surface undergo the thermal oxidation. The long-term life time of HDPE could be predicted by carrying out an accelerated life test using Arrhenius model. In addition, the lifetime equation of HDPE is suggested in order to estimate the failure time at various operating temperatures."

At the initial stage, formation of OHS citizenship was driven by ‘top-down’ approach, which was the labor force management strategy of the government to relieve industrial accidents, and to promote industrialization. But early OHS movement driven by ‘bottom-up’ approach challenged this process and tried to build a different kind of OHS citizenship. Meanwhile, medical professionals played a leading role in early OHS movement. But in course of time, the initiative in OHS movement shifted from medical professionals to labor unions, and labor unions systematically organized the OHS movement in the era of KTUC and KCTU. In this period, the relationship between experts and rank-and-file workers also changed from ‘mobilizing external alternative experts’ model to ‘cultivating OHS activists by unions themselves and coalition with external alternative experts’ model. Before long, the weakening of unionism due to the economic crisis in 1997 and labor market flexibilization accompanied by temporary decline and internal discord of OHS movement. During this time, there were fierce debates on expertise and institutionalization of OHS between OHS activists. But some attempts at the local level took this opportunity to extend ‘workers’ right to participate’ to shop-floor level. After a series of experiences, OHS movement insists that workers have to widen their territory, and to act more proactively. OHS citizenship focused on the right to labor narrowly is now being transformed into a new extended citizenship emphasizing civil virtue."
A Fast and Differentiated Localization Method for Complex Surfaces Inspection,2015,"['Differentiated localization', 'Dynamic weighted least square', 'Precision inspection', 'Weighting parameters']",,"Although significant progress has been made in free-form surface inspection, it remains a difficult problem in some tough situations.For a complex part with multiple freeform surfaces, different quality requirements are often assigned to different surface regions to guarantee the part functionality and/or assembly relations. In this case, the existing localization methods, which treat each individual surface without discrimination, are prone to over rejection of some qualified parts. In this paper, a new localization method is proposed to tackle this problem. It features in that a novel dynamic weighting strategy is introduced in the iterative optimization process to make the localization in favor of the surfaces with higher quality requirements. This strategy can avoid improper scrap of parts in inspection and proves to be more reasonable for the quality evaluation of complex parts. In addition, a distinct fast algorithm is proposed to solve the localization optimization problem. It needs only to solve a 4-order linear system to determine the rigid transformation in each iteration. This solving algorithm is much faster than the popular quaternion-based algorithm for the weighted optimization model. Experiments on a simulated example and a real integral impeller are included to verify the validity and practicability of the proposed algorithm."

This paper deals with a FLP whose objective value is fuzzy. And the right hand sides of convergent equality constraints are fuzzy numbers. We assume that the membership function of the objective value is piecewise linear and those of the right hand side are trapezoidal. Each of these trapezoidal functions can be algebraically replaced with three linear functions. Then the FLP problem is transformed into the Zimmermann's symmetric model. The fuzzy solution based on the max-min rule can be obtained by solving the crisp linear programming problem derived from the symmetric model. A numerical example has illustrated our approach. The application of our approach to the inconsistent linear system can enable generate us to get define the useful and flexible inexact solutions within acceptable tolerance. Further research is required to generalize the membership function.

According to Groome and Webb-Michael, there should be the dialectic conversations between congregation’s life and gospel at Christian liturgy as the core context of faith formation and transformation. Christian education needs to help congregation members to participate in liturgy and Christian practices actively with critical reflections on their daily lives in light of gospel, to live their lives as authentic Christian life in the world, and to provide them with appropriate education for liturgy and Christian practices as a lifelong journey. This study raises the following generative questions: “To what extent do the current texts for educational ministry manual help students to experience liturgy as the core context for their faith formation and transformation?” “If there are limits, what needs to be challenged and changed?” With these questions in mind, this study critically analyzes the current texts for educational ministry manual of Korean Church (PCK), and identifies Christian educational implications for the building of the better educational ministry. I hope that this study will help students not only participate in liturgy by linking their own daily lives in light of gospel, but also take a lifelong pilgrim journey by continuously learning and practicing authentic Christian life within the church as the body of Christ."

As a result, absorption amount of slag, Cd and Cu, was shown higher than gravel and Pb along with Zn showed higher absorption amount of gravel. However, absorption amount of slag was shown higher than gravel used as railway subbase course material as time passes by. Absorption features had more suitable determination coefficient of heavy metals in warm absorption type such as Langnmuir compared to warm absorption type like Freundlich. To add, they showed less transformation by about 10% compared to gravel in safety evaluation through modeling. This is a railway subbase course material that prevents water outflow of heavy metal thus we can know slag is needed to be used."

(1)「태극도설」에 나타난 건곤남녀와 만물화생의 선후문제이다. 성담은 인간존재인 남녀와 만물의 선후문제를 ‘기화(氣化)’와 ‘형화(形化)’의 맥락으로 풀이한다.「태극도설」은 전자에 주목한 것이다. 그리고 그것은 사물의 질료적 물상성보다는 인간의 존재적 영명성을 주목한 결과라는 것이 성담의 입장이다. 이러한 견해는 성담이 남치태에게 보낸 서간문의 내용에서 발견된다. (2) ‘중정인의’의 선후문제와 체용의 문제를 다룬다. 이것은 중정인의가 오행에 각각 배속된다고 본 주자의 입장에 대한 점검이다. 그 선후문제는 체용의 관계와 밀접한 관련을 갖는다. 그리고 무엇보다 중요한 것은 인간의 주체성이 인의라는 도덕성에 준거한다는 점이다. 인간은 ‘인의’와 ‘중정’을 정하여 인격적 표준을 구현해야만 할 사명을 가진 존재이다. 그런데 성담은 ‘인의’와 ‘중정’도 음양과 오행의 정수로부터 나온다는 것이 태극도설 의 견해라고 본 것이다. 이러한 견해는 성담이 김규정에게 보낸서간문의 내용에서 발견된다. 이상의 내용이 성담이 본「태극도설」에 대한 인간학적 해석의 내용이다. 성담은「태극도설」의 인간관에 특히 주목하면서, 주자학적 ‘원인론(原人論)’을 통해 ‘성인도통설’의 철학적 근거를 확보한다. 그것은 당대의 군주였던 정조가 본 ‘군주도통설’의 입장과는 상반된 것이었다는 점도 주목할 만한 사안이다. 성담에게 있어서는「태극도설」이야말로 ‘성인도통설’ 의 이론적 진원지와 다를 바 없는 중요한 것으로 인식되었음이 분명하다.","The focus of this paper is on the interpretation of the Diagram of the Superme Ultimate(太極圖說) in terms of the anthropological matters of Song, Hwan-Gi(宋煥箕).

He interpreted the sequenceof cosmogony as the matter of the Chi(氣) change and the transformation. The Diagram of the Superme Ultimate is focused on the first. He interpreted this character of the Diagram of the Superme Ultimate as the reason that the Diagram of the Superme Ultimate is mainly related with the ontological brightness of human rather than materialness of things. This thought is written in the letter that is sent to Nam, Chi-Tae. The second is about the sequence of zhongzhengrenyi(中正仁義) and the matter of tiyong(體用).

인간의 욕망과 모방 - 르네 지라르의 사회인류학적 관점에서 -,2015,"['모방적 욕망', '짝패', '차이의 위기', '희생양', '그리스도를 본 받아', 'Mimetic Desire', 'Double', 'Crisis of Difference', 'Scapegoat', 'Imitation of Christ']","현대 사회에 들어와서 현대 문명의 위기에 대한 소리가 높다. 우리는 그 위기 뒤에서 인간의 탐욕과 폭력성이 어른거리고 있음을 볼 수 있는데, 프랑스의 사회인류학자 르네 지라르의 욕망 이론은 문제 해결의 단초를 제공할 수 있을 것이다. 그의 이론의 핵심은 인간의 욕망은 모방적이라는 것인데, 그 요체는 두 가지다. 하나는 사람들은 스스로 어떤 것을 욕망하는 것이 아니라 타인의 욕망을 모방한다는 것이고, 다른 하나는 욕망의 주체는 욕망의 대상을 원하는 것이 아니라 욕망을 매개하는 중개자처럼 되려고 한다는 것이다. 어떤 사람이 좋은 가방을 가지고 싶다고 할 때 그 욕망은 그에게서 스스로 나온 것이 아니라 그가 그 가방을 들고 있는 어떤 멋진 사람을 본 순간 생겨난다는 것이다. 그때 그 사람은 그 가방을 원하는 것이 아니라 그 사람처럼 멋지게 되고 싶은 것이다. 또한 그는 욕망의 중개에는 두 가지 종류가 있다고 주장하였다. 첫째는 외적 중개로서 욕망의 주체와 중개자 사이의 거리가 먼 것이고, 둘째는 내적 중개로서 욕망의 주체와 중개자 사이의 거리가 가까운 것이다. 따라서 내적 중개에는 욕망의 주체가 가까이에 있는 중개자를 모방하려고 해서 그 사이에서 경쟁과 갈등이 생긴다. 지라르는 그때 두 사람은 서로가 같은 대상을 욕망하여 서로에게 장애가 되고, 갈등이 깊어질 때 폭력은 필연적으로 된다고 하면서 그 관계를 짝패라고 불렀다. 그는 짝패에서 “차이의 위기”에 주목했는데, 욕망의 주체가 욕망의 중개자를 모방하다가 두 사람이 거의 비슷해지면 두 사람 사이에서 경쟁이 치열해져서 위기가 다가오기 때문이다. 그때 두 사람은 같은 대상을 차지하려고 해서 두 사람 사이에서는 폭력적인 상황을 벌어지게 된다. 그런데 “차이의 소멸”로 인한 갈등, 경쟁, 폭력은 한 사회를 혼란 속으로 몰아넣어서 사람들은 사회에 위기가 올 때는 희생양을 선택하여 위기의 원인을 그에게 쏟아 붓고 그를 처형함으로써 위기를 극복하곤 하였다. 그러나 시간이 지나면 위기는 계속해서 오게 되어 사회에서는 종교를 만들어서 희생양을 제의로 제도화시켰다. 하지만 이런 평화는 거짓된 성스러움에 기초를 둔 평화로서 항구적인 것은 되지 못한다고 지라르는 비판한다. 그러면 사람들은 어떻게 하여야 할 것인가? 지라르는 그 문제에 대해서 다음과 같은 두 가지 해결책을 제시하였다. 첫째는 모든 신화적 종교들의 토대가 되는 희생양 메커니즘의 허위를 폭로하는 것인데, 기독교가 먼저 그 일을 하였고, 둘째는 모든 사람들이 자신의 개인적 욕망을 찾고 그리스도를 본 받아 사는 것이다. 즉 현대인들은 기독교가 신화적 종교들에 있는 거짓된 성스러움의 구조를 폭로하고 희생양의 무고함을 밝히면서 폭력의 악순환으로부터 벗어난 것을 계속 지켜나가고, 자신의 욕망이 자발적인 것이 아니라는 사실을 깨닫고 그리스도를 모방함으로써 현대 사회가 유혹하는 사탄적 욕망에서 벗어나야 한다는 것이다. 이러한 그의 생각은 현대에 만연되어 있는 무신론적 허무주의와 회의주의를 극복할 수 있는 사상이라는 생각이 든다.","Nowadays we see many things which represent the crisis of the modern civilization in our society. We know there are human greed and violence behind that crisis. It seems that a french social anthropologist René Girard's theory of mimetic desire can afford the solution which helps us to surmount that difficult position. The core of his theory is the mimetic aspect of human desire. We consider that its essence is two fold. One is that people do not desire themselves but imitate other's desire, the other is that the subject of the desire does not want to get the object of desire but to be like the mediator of that desire. For example, if one wants to get a chic bag that desire does not arise from his/her inside but when he/she sees a human being who hold that chic bag. He/She wants to be a chic person. Girard said that there are two sorts of mediation of desire; one is external mediation and the other is internal mediation. In the former case the distance between the subject of desire and the model(mediator) is far away, in the latter case the distance is very near. So there arise many conflicts between two persons or two groups as they want the same object of desire. Girard named two persons who struggle to get same thing ""the double"" and there breaks many conflicts and violences between them. So the principal source of violence between human beings is mimetic rivalry resulting from imitation of model who becomes a rival or of a rival who becomes a model. Gigard insists that the scapegoat mechanism of mythical religion comes from the collective violence as the scapegoat transforms the chaos of the mimetic crisis into a new social order. But he insists also that peace can not maintain long as it stands on the false sacred. So human being needed new scapegoats and new religions. This continues in the history of human being. But Girard suggests two solutions, one is to disclose the falsity of the scapegoat mechanism of mythical religion and the other is to imitate Jesus in order to surmount the crisis of our society."

The research model was constructed through a single-method-factor approach in order to control the effect of an unmeasured latent common method biases. The model is shown as adequately fitting to the data. The results of the research are summarized as follows. First, Authentic Leadership hasa positive and significant effect on LMX and organization commitment, whereas Transformational Leadership has no effect on them. Authentic leader builds LMX relationship with an employee who has their values n d beliefs of a similar authentic leader through having role-making process and social exchange with each employee in order to achieve the goals of the organization. And authentic leader holds to remain in their organization of an employee on formation of trust with him or her through expressing their true thoughts and feelings as well as sharing information. In addition, authentic leader improves organizational commitment of an employee who identify with the goals of the organization through participating in the decision-making in order to collect a variety of views and opinions of an employee. On the other hand, transformational leader who has transformational appearance but lacks the authenticity and truthfulness of the inner and promote their own interests only, and exists in the gap between the usual skill and transformational leader's words and actions, doesn’t have positive effect on an employee attitudes and behaviors. Second, the mediating effects of LMX in the relationship between leadership (transformational and authentic) and organizational commitment were not verified. Authentic leader builds LMX relationship with an employee who has their values a nd beliefs of a similar authentic leader, but not effect on organizational commitment. So a variety of variables that connects between LMX and organizational commitment need to find.

In a concreteway, the experience of theUzbek successful transitioncomprises a economic recovery and stability in the 1990s during the early period of transition, and then robust economic growth in 2000s and until quite recently. But, in fact the Uzbek economic performance can be said to achieved by economic initial conditions(rich natural resource endowment and favorable international price to resource export) and centralized economic policy(market control and import substitution industrialization policy)with institutional initial conditions, that is the legacies of centrally planned economic systemin Soviet era. Therefore, when only depending on economic conditions(natural resources and international market price) and self-sufficiency fromexternal shock, there could be a risk of overestimation to theUzbek real performance. In that sense it may turn out that the Uzbek growth puzzle or the Uzbek paradox without structural reform conclude to the Uzbek disguised growth paradox in the long run.

This paper presents a method of integrating the national R&D data and assists of users to navigate the integrated data via using a knowledge map service. The knowledge map service is built by using a lightweight ontology and a topic modeling method. The national R&D data is integrated with the research project as its center, i.e., the other R&D data such as research papers, patents, and reports are connected with the research project as its outputs. The lightweight ontology is used to represent the simple relationships between the integrated data such as project-outputs relationships, document-author relationships, and document-topic relationships. Knowledge map enables us to infer further relationships such as co-author and co-topic relationships. To extract the relationships between the integrated data, a Relational Data-to-Triples transformer is implemented. Also, a topic modeling approach is introduced to extract the document-topic relationships. A triple store is used to manage and process the ontology data while preserving the network characteristics of knowledge map service.  Knowledge map can be divided into two types: one is a knowledge map used in the area of knowledge management to store, manage and process the organizations’ data as knowledge, the other is a knowledge map for analyzing and representing knowledge extracted from the science & technology documents. This research focuses on the latter one. In this research, a knowledge map service is introduced for integrating the national R&D data obtained from National Digital Science Library (NDSL) and National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS), which are two major repository and service of national R&D data servicing in Korea. A lightweight ontology is used to design and build a knowledge map. Using the lightweight ontology enables us to represent and process knowledge as a simple network and it fits in with the knowledge navigation and visualization characteristics of the knowledge map. The lightweight ontology is used to represent the entities and their relationships in the knowledge maps, and an ontology repository is created to store and process the ontology. In the ontologies, researchers are implicitly connected by the national R&D data as the author relationships and the performer relationships. A knowledge map for displaying researchers’ network is created, and the researchers’ network is created by the co-authoring relationships of the national R&D documents and the co-participation relationships of the national R&D projects.  To sum up, a knowledge map-service system based on topic modeling and ontology is introduced for processing knowledge about the national R&D data such as research projects, papers, patent, project reports, and Global Trends Briefing (GTB) data. The system has goals 1) to integrate the national R&D data obtained from NDSL and NTIS, 2) to provide a semantic & topic based information search on the integrated data, and 3) to provide a knowledge map services based on the semantic analysis and knowledge processing. The S&T information such as research papers, research reports, patents and GTB are daily updated from NDSL, and the R&D projects information including their participants and output information are updated from the NTIS. The S&T information and the national R&D information are obtained and integrated to the integrated database. Knowledge base is constructed by transforming the relational data into triples referencing R&D ontology. In addition, a topic modeling method is employed to extract the relationships between the S&T documents and topic keyword/s representing the documents. The topic modeling approach enables us to extract the relationships and topic keyword/s based on the semantics, not based on the simple keyword/s. Lastly, we show an experiment on the const"

Simulation of superelastic SMA helical springs,2015,"['shape memory alloy', 'helical spring', 'martensite transformation', 'constitutive model', 'finite element method']",,"Shape memory alloy (SMA) helical springs have found a large number of different applications in industries including biomedical devices and actuators. According to the application of SMA springs in different actuators, they are usually under tension and torsion loadings. The ability of SMAs in recovering inelastic strains is due to martensitic phase transformation between austenite and martensite phases. Stress or temperature induced martensite transformation induced of SMAs is a remarkable property which makes SMA springs more superior in comparison with traditional springs. The present paper deals with the simulation of SMA helical spring at room temperature. Three-dimensional phenomenological constitutive model is used to describe superelastic behavior of helical spring. This constitutive model is implemented as a user subroutine through ABAQUS STANDARD (UMAT), and the process of the implementation is presented. Numerical results show that the developed constitutive model provides an appropriate approach to captures the general behavior of SMA helical springs."

In particularly, it should be noted that authentic leadership changes employee attitudes and behaviors through uplifting their positive psychology away from the leader``s styles or skills to raise short-term for business performance improvement. This study aims to examine the effects of transformational and authentic leadership as antecedent simultaneously, and psychological capital a mediating variable, on organizational commitment and explore both direct and indirect causal relationships between these by the type of leadership. Data for analysis were collected through questionnaires from 147 employees from October to December 2012. To test the hypotheses, structural equation model was employed. The research model was constructed through a single-method-factor approach in order to control the effect of an unmeasured latent common method biases. The model is shown as adequately fitting to the data. The results of the research are summarized as follows. First, Authentic Leadership has a positive and significant effect on psychological capital and organization commitment, whereas Transformational Leadership has no effect on them. Second, only the mediating effects of psychological capital in the relationship between authentic leadership and organizational commitment were verified, whereas between transformational leadership and organizational commitment has no mediating effect of psychological capital. In conclusion of this study, authentic leadership is more effective a positive influence on psychological capital and organizational commitment then transformation leadership. Therefore, for developing authentic leadership, it is important for corporations to make a identification of leader goals and organizational goals, improve self-awareness through competing narratives, spread positive emotions and behaviors (positive emotion and behavioral model contagion), provide HR systems and methodologies. Employees of the psychological capital should improve effect of authentic leadership on organizational commitment. Psychological capital should be developed as an organizational intervention of state-like and not trait-like. Also, employees and leaders should provide the correct insights and directions through building empirical theory and scientific measurement."

This study develops a model in which transformational leadership affects team commitment and service performance through the types of conflict resolution adopted by team members. The data were collected from a survey of 244 service team members in foodservice industry. Structural Equation Models revealed that transformational leadership promotes team commitment and thereby team service performance by encouraging teams to adopt types of conflict resolution(cooperative, competitive and avoidant types). Cooperative and avoidant types of conflict resolution had direct effects on team commitment. However, competitive types of conflict resolution had no direct effects on team commitment. In addition, cooperative and avoidant types of conflict resolution had mediating role between transformational leadership and team commitment. Team commitment had mediating role between cooperative, avoidant types of conflict resolution and team service performance. These results suggest that transformational leadership may help team members manage conflicts for their mutual benefit. Transformational leaders can also help team members understand the potential value of managing conflict cooperatively and help them develop relevant skills to discuss their views open-mindedly. The conflict resolution is an important mechanism through which transformational leadership enhances team commitment and, in turn, achieves higher team service performance. Implications and suggestions for future studies were discussed."

We extend extant stochas-tic volatility models with level effects crucial in characterizing the stationarity of a continuous time stochastic process, estimate the extended models using an ef-ficient simulation-based MCML(Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood) estimation method using importance sampling and implement model diagnostics using the inverse of standard normal distribution of the dynamic probability integral trans-form obtained via an auxiliary particle filter.

The analysis results are as follows. First, the principal's transformational leadership had a significant impact on job satisfaction of teachers, and it had the most impact on school organization vitality climate. Second, teacher efficacy showed both direct and meditating effects between research variables, which indicates that the principal needs to devise a financial support system and develop programs to enhance teacher efficacy, ultimately increasing the job satisfaction of teachers. Third, intergroup structure invariance, measurement invariance and partial scalar invariance were all satisfied. Latent mean differences in teacher groups by gender revealed that male teachers had a higher degree of awareness on the transformational leadership and teacher's job satisfaction. The latent mean differences depending on the position showed that head teachers had a higher awareness of the transformational leadership, school vitality climate and teacher's job satisfaction compared to general teachers. Fourth, the path that represents a significant difference between male and female teachers was not found with respect to teacher coefficients between teacher groups. Path coefficient differences depending on the position also found that the influence of transformational leadership on the school vitality climate was greater to the group of head teachers, whereas that of school organization vitality climate on the teacher's job satisfaction was significant only to the group of general teachers. In addition, the influence of teacher efficacy on the job satisfaction was greater to the group of general teachers. These findings suggest that the principal's leadership is not applied to the school members in the same manner since there was a difference in the degree of influence and awareness on each research variable according to background variables of teachers. Therefore, principles are expected to take these points into account when they exert transformational leadership."

The LSP mathematical model is formulated with the average geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) as the criterion. To achieve an optimization solution, a tolerant factor based complete stratified series approach and grid searching method are utilized to obtain the possible optimal BS placement. Because of the LSP model utilization, the proposed algorithm has wider application scenarios with different accuracy requirements over different trajectory segments.

The nationwide survey data was collected from 945 people with disabilities in 49 sheltered workshops from March 10 to April 25 in 2014 by mail.The major findings of this study are as follows. First, The social participation was higher in the areas where they can do things by themselves or with their social acquaintances. Second, according to the result of unconditional means model analysis, the random effects of level-2 was statistically significant. Third, the result of analysing the unconditional slope model analysis, showed that the individual factors such as family supports, co-worker supports, disability type, length of training, and the training benefit were statistically significant. Fourth, analysis of the sheltered workshop’s organizational effects on social participation of people with disabilities, shown that the social participation of people with disability increased when the directors possess organizational servant leadership rather than transformational leadership and when vocational training instructor’s recognition level on autonomy of person with disabilities is higher. Lastly, the results of conditional slope model analysis showed that interaction effects appeared between the organizational network and co-worker supports, between servant leadership and co-worker supports and between transformational leadership and disability type."
A Fast TU Size Decision Method for HEVC RQT Coding,2015,"['TU size decision', 'HEVC/H.265', 'RQT coding', 'video compression']",,"The emerging high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard adopts the quadtree-structured transform unit (TU) in the residual quadtree (RQT) coding. Each TU allows to be split into four equal sub-TUs recursively. The RQT coding is performed for all the possible transform depth levels to achieve the highest coding efficiency, but it requires a very high computational complexity for HEVC encoders. In order to reduce the computational complexity requested by the RQT coding, in this paper, we propose a fast TU size decision method incorporating an adaptive maximum transform depth determination (AMTD) algorithm and a full check skipping - early termination (FCS-ET) algorithm. Because the optimal transform depth level is highly content-dependent, it is not necessary to perform the RQT coding at all transform depth levels. By the AMTD algorithm, the maximum transform depth level is determined for current treeblock to skip those transform depth levels rarely used by its spatially adjacent treeblocks. Additionally, the FCS-ET algorithm is introduced to exploit the correlations of transform depth level between four sub-CUs generated by one coding unit (CU) quadtree partitioning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed overall algorithm significantly reduces on average 21% computational complexity while maintaining almost the same rate distortion (RD) performance as the HEVC test model reference software, HM 13.0."
DEA와 SFA를 활용한우체국보험의 효율성 평가에 관한 연구,2015,"['우체국보험', '효율성', '자료포락분석(DEA)', '확률적 프론티어분석(SFA)', '콥더글라스 승수모형', '시장지향성', '개인노력', 'postal insurance', 'efficiency', 'Cobb-Douglas multiplicative model', 'market orientation', 'self-learning efforts']",,"The paper evaluates the efficiency of the Korean postal insurance and also identifies important factors affecting the outputs in order to provide the post office with valuable direction of the business innovation. In the paper, both premium income and agent income of the regional post offices are employed as output variables while market orientation, self-effort and the number of agents, their ages and duration of jobs are used as input variables. To measure efficiency, we apply not only data envelopment analysis (DEA) as a non-parametric method but also stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) as a parametric method. In particular, the paper focuses on analyzing error terms which can be decomposed into random and efficiency errors in order to check whether there exists significant difference in efficiency among postal offices. We also employ Cobb Douglas multiplicative models for log-transformed data to reflect the relationship between the original input and output variables considering the law of diminishing return. The empirical results using data of total 120 postal offices reveal that for premium income as output, the model errors are mainly due to random errors rather than efficiency errors. That is, premium income model is fully explained by the input variables. On the other hand, for agent income as output, the model errors come from both random and efficiency errors but the latter is much bigger, which indicates there exists difference in efficiency. Namely, agent income is not fully explained by the input variables. Another important finding is that self-learning efforts of agents significantly affect their income. In addition, market orientation of the post offices also works for improvement of the outputs for the group maintaining a higher level of market orientation. So we recommend the postal insurance to enhance market orientation to a certain threshold and also encourage the agents to make self-learning efforts."

(1997), we investigate the stationarity of riskless short-term interest rate processes, analyzing generalized stochastic volatility models with level effects and examine the compatibility of stationarity of short-term interest rates with the popular dynamic term structure of models of interest rates, such as ATSM and QTSM. We extend extant stochastic volatility models with level effects crucial in characterizing the stationarity of a continuous time stochastic process, estimate the extended models using an  efficient simulation-based MCML(Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood) estimation method using importance sampling and implement model diagnostics using the inverse of standard normal distribution of the dynamic probability integral transform obtained via an auxiliary particle filter. Empirical estimation results indicate that TB3M and Call1d exhibit drift-induced stationarity compatible with both ATSM and QTSM, and that ED1M, KTB3M, MMF7d, CD91d and CP91d are of volatility-induced stationarity. Consequently, the results imply that, without careful consideration for the nature of stationarity of a short-term interest rate,  indiscriminate application of theoretical models assuming the drift-induced stationarity of short-term interest rates may cause serious failure in derivative pricing and risk management."

In this study, we have assimilated Global Positioning System Radio Occultation (GPS-RO) bending angle measurements in addition to conventional data within ensemble-based data assimilation system. Before assimilating bending angle data, we performed a vertical unit conversion. The information of vertical localization for GPS-RO data is given by the unit of meter, but the vertical localization method in the LETKF system is based on pressure unit. Therefore, with a clever conversion of the vertical information, we have conducted experiments to search for the best vertical localization scale on GPS-RO data under the Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). As a result, we found the optimal setting of vertical localization for the GPSRO bending angle data assimilation. We plan to apply the selected localization strategy to the LETKF system implemented to KIM which is expected to give better analysis of GPS-RO data assimilation due to much higher model top."
Transmission loss of orthogonally stiffened laminated composite plates,2015,"['Composite plate', 'Layerwise theory', 'Orthogonal stiffeners', 'Transmission loss']",,"Sound transmission through laminated composite plates reinforced by two sets of orthogonal stiffeners is investigated theoretically. Alayerwise shear deformable theory is used to model the vibration of the laminated composite face-panel; A governing equation of I sectioncomposite beam is introduced, which accounts for the extensional, flexural, torsional and their coupling effects. The Euler-Bernoullibeam theory and torsional wave equation are employed to describe the flexural and rotational motions of the rib stiffeners, respectively.The technique of Fourier transform is applied to solve the governing equations resulting in infinite sets of simultaneous algebraic coupledequations, which are numerically solved by truncating them into a finite range insofar as the solutions converge. The accuracy of thenumerical solutions is checked by comparing the present model predictions with existing literature. The validated model is subsequentlyemployed to quantify the effects of the spacing of the stiffeners and the stacking geometry of the laminated composite face-panel andstiffeners on sound transmission through the structure. It is demonstrated that both the stiffener spacing and the stacking geometry havesignificant influences on the sound transmission loss across the structure. The proposed theoretical model successfully characterizes theprocess of sound penetration through stiffened laminated composite plates, which should be much helpful for the practical design of suchstructures with acoustic requirements."
"비물가 요인은 원,달러 환율에 대한구매력 평가 불균형의 느린 조정을 설명할 수 있는가?",2015,"['원/달러 환율', '실질환율', '구매력 평가', '버블', 'Engel and Morley 추측', 'Won/dollar Exchange Rate', 'Bubble Trend', 'Beveridge Nelson Decomposition', 'Error Correction Model', 'Purchasing Power Parity']",,"The Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that relative price level between countries determines the exchange rate which is based upon an extension of intuitive law of one price. It is doing a role of key linkage to the monetaristic approach of long run exchange rate determination and open macro-economic analysis. Therefore its rigorous test and understanding are critical for modern economic theory evolution. However, according to Rogoff (1996), Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000), the variability of real exchange rate is larger than the level that is expected by the present models explaining the PPP deviation. According to Frankel and Rose (1996), Cheung and Lai (1998, 2000a, 2000b), Papell (1997), Wu and Wu (2001), the half life from PPP deviation to equilibrium adjustment is roughly 3～5 and thus disequilibrium adjustment speed is quite slow. Obviously this adjustment time is too much long than it expected by the speed is price rigidity models; i.e., 1～2 years. Therefore it is regarded as an important puzzle of international economic theory which demands fundamentally different sight to explain the connection of exchange rate with the price. With respect to this issue, remarkable hypothesis/evidences have been suggested to explain slow purchasing power adjustment. Firstly, Engel and Morley (2001), asserts that the root of the PPP puzzle may be resolved by allowing different speeds of convergence for nominal exchange rates and prices. In contrast to usual rational-expectations sticky-price models, which impose equivalent reversion speed for nominal exchange rates and prices, they examine an empirical model that supposes those variables to adjust at different speeds. Empirical evidences from state-space model estimation show that while prices converge relatively fast, nominal exchange rates converge slowly. It suggests that the lethargic rate of PPP reversion may come largely from slow nominal exchange rate adjustment rather than from slow price adjustment. Engel and Morley (2001, 24) conjectured that “bubbles or herding might temporarily send the exchange rate off on disequilibrium paths that result in the appearance of slow convergence to the equilibrium.” Cheung et al. (2004), using vector error correction model, estimated the speeds at which the individual variables revert to their long-run values. Their results confirmed those of Engel and Morley (2001) that nominal exchange rates do converge at a much slower rate than prices. Half-lives of nominal exchange rates are estimated to be from 3 to 6 years, while half-lives of prices are found to be just about 1 to 2 years. They also found that about 60~90% of PPP disequilibrium adjustment takes place through nominal exchange rate adjustment. They conclude that if nominal exchange rates converge much more slowly than prices, the PPP reversion speed can be slower than the price convergence speed, as described by the PPP puzzle. Wu et al. (2011) also found that main findings of Cheung et al. (2004) are robust to possible misspecifications in the true data-generating process (DGP). They examined the source of a real exchange-rate adjustment based on the impulse-response function constructed from local projections proposed by Jorda (2005) when the DGP is unknown. They showed that nominal exchange-rate adjustments dominate in the reversion toward PPP regardless of a nominal exchange-rate shock or a price shock. This paper examines these view that not the price but the bubble in the exchange rate mainly explains the slow adjustment of exchange rate to the PPP equilibrium especially focusing on the conjecture of Engel and Morley (2001, 24) through following two fold approaches. Firstly, following Kim (2014), we test whether there is an I(1) stochastic bubble trend, which is independent with an I(1) trend of price in exchange rate. For this, we exploit a transformed error correction model and Beveridge-Nelson decomposition. Secondly, the shock of aforementioned bubble trend may induce a longrun/sustainable response of the PPP disequilibrium error when the cointegration vector is different from it implied by the PPP (possibly due to the barrier/frictions for trade such as tariff, transportation costs which hinders the PPP arbitrage.) We theoretically expect the response of PPP disequilibrium error from which the part induced by the barrier/frictions for trade are deleted may be mainly affected by the ‘sticky’ price as conventional approach explains."

Given the prior research mainly regarding the cognitive trust built between trustors and trustees, we proposed that relation benefits, relation norm, support, transformational leadership, new product development, dependence, communication, formalization, fairness, conflicts, and transaction-specific investments would influence ability, benevolence, and integrity which are trustors’ perceived components of trustee trustworthiness. Specifically, relationship benefits, support, transformational leadership, new product development, dependence, and transaction-specific investments were proposed to influence trustors’ perception on trustees’ ability; relationship benefits, relation norm, support, transformational leadership, communication, fairness, conflicts, and transaction-specific investments were proposed to influence trustors’ perception on trustees’ benevolence; relation norm, transformational leadership, communication, formalization, fairness, conflicts were proposed to influence trustors’ perception on trustees’ benevolence.

Analyzing the AAS and the distribution of affairs, this study identifies that the current relationship between the central government and local governments can be classified into the agent model where the central government exercises a strong control over local governments in the process of policy implementation as well as policy formation. Stressing that this type of relationship needs to be transformed into the partnership model or the inter-dependence model for the development of agriculture and rural communities, this study suggests the following policy directions:First, for the short term, more opportunities for local governments to participate in the agricultural policy formation and planning process need to be allowed while increasing their autonomy in the implementation process. For the long term, an establishment of an agency dealing with nationwide agricultural affairs is required to let local governments deal with their own affairs, which eventually will improve competitiveness of agriculture and rural communities. Second, local governments need to strengthen their planning function of agricultural policy by rearranging their agricultural organizational structures. Training and education to the personnels who are responsible for the planning and continuous experts' advice are also needed to increase the planning capacity of local governments. Third, to increase local autonomy and to secure financial responsibility, more blanket subsidies needs to be given to local governments. Fourth and finally, the distribution of agricultural affairs needs to be decided by using the bottom-up approach whereby the right of selection is given in order of primary local government-regional government-central government."

Whether, or how much, the employees raise a voice, or keep silent, is the most important variable that can explain the degree of organizational activation. This study examined the impact of leadership as the most critical antecedent, focused on the voice, and silence, of the employee, both of which are vital for activated communication in organizations. To highlight how leadership affects, this study adopted transformational, author-itative, and abusive leaderships to be examined. Also examined are the con-sequences of voice and silence, namely innovative behavior as a positive result and intent to leave as a negative one. The data was collected from 323 employees, in 17 work organizations. Structural equation models were employed to test the hypotheses. The results show that all three types of leadership exert significant effects on employee voice and silence, but their effects vary. Transformational leadership exerted significant influence on pro-social voice, but not on others. In other words, it does not soothe negative attitudes and behaviors. Authoritative leadership positively affected both defensive voice and silence, suggesting it stimulates defensive behavior (either voice or silence) rather than an obedient one. Abusive leadership showed significantly negative effects on the three behaviors, namely pro-social silence, defensive voice and silence as well. The results suggest strong needs for controlling abusive leadership in workplace. On the other hand, innovative behavior turned out to be positively associated with both types of voice behavior, namely pro-social and defensive voice. It suggests that, regardless of its motives, voice can make change and innovation. Intent to leave was positively associated with defensive silence, and negatively with pro-social voice. These findings are suggestive to the effectiveness values of employee voice and silence."
Functional Display of Active β-Galactosidase on Bacillus subtilis Spores Using Crust Proteins as Carriers,2015,"['spore surface display', 'Bacillus subtilis', 'crust protein Y (CotY)', 'crust protein Z (CotZ)', 'β- Galactosidase']",,"Two model proteins of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and a tetrameric β- Galactosidase (β-Gal) from Bacillus stearothermophilus IAM11001 were fused to the C-terminus of the crust proteins Y (CotY) and Z (CotZ) from B. subtilis 168. Surface-expression of the resulting fusion proteins CotY-EGFP, CotZ-EGFP, CotY-β-Gal, and CotZ-β-Gal were then evaluated. Fluorescence intensity analysis of the transformed strains indicated that the CotY-EGFP and CotZ-EGFP fusion proteins were successfully displayed on spores. β-Gal was anchored on the surface of B. subtilis spores, confirmed based on western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Results of a β-Gal assay showed that when fused to CotY and CotZ, the obtained enzyme activities of spore-displayed β-Gals were 0.12 and 0.25 U/mg of spores (dry weight), respectively. CotY and CotZ were, thus, shown to be suitable candidate carriers for display of multimeric enzymes on the spore surface."

In addition, the exactnonlocal Reddy beam theory solution presented here should be useful to engineers designing nanoelectromechanical devices. The smallscaleeffect is considered based on nonlocal elasticity theory of Eringen. The nonlocal equations of motion are derived through Hamilton’sprinciple, and they are solved by applying DTM. Numerical results reveal that the proposed modeling and semi-analytical approachcan provide more accurate frequency results of the SWCNTs compared to analytical results and some cases in the literature. The detailedmathematical derivations are presented, and numerical investigations are performed, whereas emphasis is placed on investigating theeffect of several parameters such as small-scale effects, boundary conditions, mode number, thickness ratio, temperature change, andWinkler spring modulus on the natural frequencies of the SWCNTs in detail. The vibration behavior of SWCNTs is significantly influencedby these effects. Results indicate that the inclusion of size effect results in a decrease in nanobeam stiffness and leads to a decreasein natural frequency. Numerical results are presented to serve as benchmarks for future analyses of SWCNTs."

This trend is observed annually. Temperature and rainfall amount are influential factors in the change of sales amount. Sales amount increases at the start of spring and reach its height during summer period. Winter shows the least amount of sales. The sales amount of each retail store is predictable through this trend. Big retailers are already applying sales prediction models to assign budget and marketing cost to each store. The ordering system is enhanced through these models as well. These days, retailer's sales growth rate showed negative growth even when these models were attempted. The solution is to enhance the efficiency of marketing and not quantitative growth through building more stores.

EMD-based output-only identification of mode shapes of linear structures,2015,"['output-only modal identification', 'mode shapes', 'Hilbert-Huang transform', 'empirical mode decomposition', 'intrinsic mode function', 'UCLA Factor Building']",,"The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) consists of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral analysis. EMD has been successfully applied for identification of mode shapes of structures based on input-output approaches. This paper aims to extend application of EMD for output-only identification of mode shapes of linear structures. In this regard, a new simple and efficient method based on band-pass filtering and EMD is proposed. Having rather accurate estimates of modal frequencies from measured responses, the proposed method is capable to extract the corresponding mode shapes. In order to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the proposed identification method, two case studies are considered. In the first case, the performance of the method is validated through the analysis of simulated responses obtained from an analytical structural model with known dynamical properties. The low-amplitude responses recorded from the UCLA Factor Building during the 2004 Parkfield earthquake are used in the second case to identify the first three mode shapes of the building in three different directions. The results demonstrate the remarkable ability of the proposed method in correct estimation of mode shapes of the linear structures based on rather accurate modal frequencies."

한국과 미국 종업원들의 조직몰입과 직무만족도에 미치는 변혁적 리더십과 거래적 리더십의 조절효과 비교,2015,"['조직몰입', '직무만족도', '변혁적 리더십', '거래적 리더십', '한국', '미국', 'Organizational commitment', 'Job satisfaction', 'Transformational leadership', 'Transactional leadership', 'Korea', 'U.S.']",,"In this study, the effects of two leadership styles on organizational commitment (OC) and job satisfaction (JS) are compared across countries. Based on culturally endorsed implicit leadership theory (CLT), we developed and empirically tested a two-by-two matrix model to identify differences in leadership effectiveness depending on the cultural context. Bass (1985) argued that transformational leadership (TFL) is built on a base of transactional leadership (TSL); therefore, a positive moderating effect may exist between these two leadership types. However, House (1996) challenged that argument by insisting that TSL has a negative moderating effect on employee outcome. In this study, we suggest that the moderating effect of TSL may differ depending on the culture. The results of our analysis of four groups classified according to the perceptions of subordinate workers (315 Korean and 181 U.S. employees) of TFL and TSL styles showed highest values for both OC and JS in the high-TFL and high-TSL groups in the Korean sample, while values for the high-TFL and low-TSL groups were highest for U.S. employees. To elucidate these findings further, we investigated the moderating effects of various subdimensions of TFL and TSL. The results indicated that TFL and TSL had positive moderating effects on OC and JS in Korea. However, no such moderating effect was evident in the U.S. sample. These results were consistent with the results of the two-by-two matrix. The findings of this study provide important insight into how managers can lead Korean and U.S. employees more successfully."

The play divides characters into two groups, namely ‘fine’ and ‘wild’ companies, and it places them in different floors of the inn. Relegated downstairs, the wild company ply their routine trade, representing realist popular culture. In contrast, aristocratic guests throw a French-style salon party, producing romantic ambience. Generally, Neoplatonist culture indicates French fashions regarding Platonic love which was practiced as pastimes in the courtly circle of the Caroline period. Originally, this French culture was cultivated at the salon of the Hôtel de Rambouillet in the early seventeenth century. In the play, the central scenes are occupied by the Court of Love in which the participants discuss love and valour. Their discussion is conducted in the form of dialogue modeled on Plato’s Symposium. Along with Plato, their thesis of Platonic love is influenced by the Florentine philosopher, Marsilio Ficino, who proposed Platonic love as a divine doctrine by combining Plato’s idealism with Christianity. With the progress of the Court of Love, however, the play transforms the thesis of Platonic love and registers the two protagonists’ psychological development towards romantic attachment to each other. In French salons, Platonic love was practiced as a didactic method for a coterie of admirers to refine their emotional investment through tension between the excitement and denial of love passion, which is orchestrated by an idealized woman. But the denouement of the play shows romantic consummation of love affairs between Lady Frampul and Lord Lovel, which has developed in the course of their role-playing in the Court of Love. In doing so, the play suggests the motif of theatrum mundi as its main concern of thematic development."

To do so, we use a multivariate jump diffusion process for obligors’ default intensity, where jumps (i.e. magnitude of contribution of primary events to default intensities) occur simultaneously and their sizes are dependent. For these simultaneous jumps and their sizes, a homogeneous Poisson process. We apply copuladependent default intensities of multivariate Cox process to derive the joint Laplace transform that provides us with joint survival/default probability and other relevant joint probabilities. For that purpose, the piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) theory developed in [7] and the martingale methodology in [6] are used. We compute survival/default probability using three copulas, which are Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM), Gaussian and Student-t copulas, with exponential marginal distributions. We then apply the results to calculate CDS rates assuming deterministic rate of interest and recovery rate. We also conduct sensitivity analysis for the CDS rates by changing the relevant parameters and provide their figures."

The objective of this paper is to examine the links between cloud computing absorptive capacity and organizational competitive advantage, and the role of structural ambidexterity in affecting cloud computing absorptive capacity. To achieve the objective, a total of 165 survey data were collected from IT and cloud computing managers in the companies that use cloud services. The structural equation modeling results show that both organizational flexibility and process formalization significantly influence cloud computing absorptive capacity. Absorptive capacity in turns significantly affects competitive advantage.

Restructuring the Discourses for a Real Multi-cultural Society in South Korea,2015,"['social capital', 'ethnicity', 'community', 'multiculturalism']",,"South Korea is transforming into a multicultural society complicatedly and rapidly. But, the existing discourses have many limits to realizing a multicultural society because they are restricted to partial immigrants or lopsided toward the subjects like the government, multiculturalism, and human capital only. This study focuses on the possibility of a macroscopic discourse by introducing new ways of achieving a multicultural society, including international marriage migrant women (IMMW), foreign workers, and North Korean migrants. First, it suggests that the leading subject of the multicultural society should change from government to community. The multicultural society led by the government cannot help but have many problems and limitations because of depending mainly on social welfare. Second, it argues that the discussion level for a multicultural society must come down from abstract multiculturalism to concrete ethnicity to understand immigrants precisely. Third, it contends that the value of a multicultural society should be pursued not for human capital but for social capital. It is necessary to think of a multicultural society as helpful and profitable in respect of immigrants or in respect of both immigrants and natives. It is time to find a path to the multicultural society on the Korean model through macroscopic discourse."
Helical gear multi-contact tooth mesh load analysis with flexible bearings and shafts,2015,"['helical gear', 'multi-contact', 'load analysis']",,"A multi-contact tooth meshing model for helical gear pairs considering bearing and shaft deformations is proposed. First, to easily incorporate into the system model, the complicated Harris’ bearing force-displacement relationship is simplified applying a linear least square curve fit. Then, effects of shaft and bearing flexibilities on the helical gear meshing behavior are implemented through transformation matrices which contain the helical gear orientation and spatial displacement under loads. Finally, true contact lines between conjugated teeth are approximated applying a modified meshing equation that includes the influence of tooth flank displacement on the tooth contact induced by shaft and bearing displacements.Based on the model, the bearing’s force-displacement relation is examined, and the effects of shaft deformation and external load on the multi-contact tooth mesh load distribution are also analyzed. The advantage of this work is, unlike previous works to search true contact lines through time-consuming iterative strategy, to determine true contact lines between conjugated teeth directly with presentation of deformations of bearings and shafts."

Firstly, analytical solution of the problem is obtained by using theory of elasticity and integral transform techniques. Then, finite element model of the problem is constituted using ANSYS software and the two dimensional analysis of the problem is carried out. The contact stresses under rigid circular punch, the contact areas, normal stresses along the axis of symmetry are obtained for both solutions. The results show that contact stresses and the normal stresses obtained from finite element method (FEM) provide boundary conditions of the problem as well as analytical results. Also, the contact areas obtained from finite element method are very close to results obtained from analytical method; disagree by 0.03-1.61%. Finally, it can be said that there is a good agreement between two methods."

A total of 176 corn inbreeding lines including commercial corn cultivars were subjected to FT-IR spectroscopy. To establish the prediction model for total protein content from corn seed, 33 corn inbreeding lines out of 176 were randomly selected and total seed protein contents using Bradford assay were examined.

Based on the findings of the study, it has been shown that such works of media arts that involve development of concepts with `creativity` and `variability` from the perspective of visual concept, such as 3D modeling and mapping, with `consistency` through out all concepts, as well as the works with stronger `restriction` of concept within its animation and postproduction, attracted more interests from the viewer. From the point of view with visual four steps in composition, positioning the change in quality of 3D `shape` and `material` following the four-step rule, and gradual increase of change in quantity within the `number` and `size`, in addition to increased degree of systematization within the change, such as the `scene change`, resulted in more heightened emotions from the viewer. Thus, in order to maximize sensation of visual immersion, strategies for `developing 3D visual concepts` while `synchronizing` them, as well as `strengthening the four steps within 3D visual composition` while `systematizing` them should be emphasized."

The proposed scheme is based on a network with mobile stations (MS) which are deployed with multi cells. We assume that the MS have the signals from both cells. The signal from near cell are considered as desired signal and the signals from the other cells are interference signal. Since the channel is blind, so that we transmit Hadamard matrix pattern pilot stream to estimate the channel; that gives easier and fast channel estimation for large scale MIMO channel. The computation of Hadamard based system takes only complex additions, and thus the complexity of which is much lower than the scheme with Fourier transform since complex multiplications are not needed.

A Simplified Approach to Assessment of Mission Success for Helicopter Landing on a Ship,2015,"['Dynamic interface', 'helicopter landing', 'pilot control model', 'ship motion', 'workload rating']",,"In this paper, operation of a helicopter near a ship is statistically investigated to provide an estimate of the probability of successfully recovering manned rotorcraft on the deck of a moving ship.To this end, pitch, roll, and heave motion of the ship are calculated according to sea states. In addition, effect on dynamics of the rotorcraft from ship airwake is also considered in a simplified way. By assuming that a helicopter can land on a ship if a pilot maintains relative position and attitude difference within the safe boundary for a given time, the operational limits are probabilistically determined in terms of pilot’s workload for a specified mission. The simulation environment consists of linearized helicopter dynamics, an optimal pilot model, effect of turbulent ship airwake, and ship motion. Control activities of the piloted helicopter for position holding with respect to the moving ship are transformed to generalized workload ratings. Simulation results show the proposed approach can evaluate and predict mission success rates for various operational combinations, allowing implementation into the overall effectiveness assessment of the ship and ship-helicopter combination."
Nearshore waves and longshore sediment transport along Rameshwaram Island off the east coast of India,2015,"['Wave characteristics', 'Longshore sediment transport', 'Wave transformation', 'Remote sensing']",,Wave-induced Longshore Sediment Transport (LST) play an important role in the dynamics of the Dhanushkodi sandspit located southeast of Rameshwaram. The LST along the Dhanushkodi coast is studied based on data collected simultaneously in Gulf of Mannar (GoM) and Palk Bay (PB) using directional waverider buoys. The numerical model REF/DIF1 was used to calculate the nearshore waves and the LST rate was estimated using three different formulae. The model validation was done based on the measured nearshore waves using InterOcean S4DW. Numerical model LITPACK was also used for simulating non-cohesive sediment transport and the LITLINE module was used to study the shoreline evolution over 5 years. Low net annual LST along PB (${\sim}0.01{\times}10^6m^3$) compared to the GoM region ($0.3{\times}10^6m^3$) were due to the weak waves. Accretion in the region led to growth of the Dhanushkodi sandspit by 65 m during the period 2010-2015.

As the size of buildings is becoming massive, the need for structural health monitoring (SHM) technique is increasing. Various SHM techniques have been studied for buildings which have different dynamic characteristics and influenced by various external loads. “Abnormal behavior point” is a moment when the structure starts vibrating abnormally and this can be detected by comparing between before and after abnormal behavior point. In other words, anomalous behavior is a sign of damage on structures and estimating the abnormal behavior point can be directly related to the safety of structure. Abnormal behavior causes damage on structures and this leads to enormous economic damage as well as damage for humans. This study proposes an estimating technique to find abnormal behavior point using Hilber-Huang Transform which is a time-frequency signal analysis technique and the proposed algorithm has been examined through laboratory tests with a bridge model using a shaking table."

The results were as follows. A sudden drop of water temperature was confirmed due to upwelling on the East coast when ninth typhoon Chanhom is transformed from tropical cyclones into extra tropical cyclone, then kept moving eastwards from Pyongyang forming a strong southerly wind after 13th and this phenomenon lasted for two days. The high SST(sea surface temperature) is confirmed due to a strong northerly wind by 11th typhoon Nangka. This strong wind directly affected the east coast for three days causing the Ekman effect which transported high offshore surface waters to the coast. The downwelling occurred causing an accumulation of high temperature surface water. As a results, the SST of 15m and 25m rose to that of 5m."

Classical continuum theory is inherently size independent, while nonlocalelasticity exhibits size dependence. Among other things, this leads to a new expression for the effective nonlocal bending moment ascontrasted to its classical counterpart. The thermal problem is addressed in the context of the Green-Naghdi (GN) theory of heat transportwithout energy dissipation. The governing partial differential equations are solved in the Laplace transform domain by the state spaceapproach of modern control theory. Inverse of Laplace transforms are computed numerically using Fourier expansion techniques.

The ternary alloys have been grown with identical growth-front roughness as confirmed by XRR and RHEED observations. The spottier RHEED has been observed with increased thickness of the InGaN as opposed to streakier behavior of AlGaN. We have noticed incremental nature of RMS roughness, skewness and kurtosis of InGaN surface compared to GaN or AlGaN from AFM as evident by final spotty RHEED for InGaN. However, the analyzed fractal dimension is lower for InGaN as opposed to AlGaN ( ). From the kinetic roughening perspective of adatoms, the experimental evidences lead to the high correlation between binding energy of the cluster atoms ( ) and the modified DDA growth model with dissociation and evaporation to confirm the efficacy of the study. The initial streaky and spotty RHEED of InGaN and AlGaN, respectively, can be attributed to their Eb that causes smoothing and roughening of the GaN surface due to adatoms surface mobility behavior. Therefore, the fractal description reveals the fact during formation of nitride hetero-interface while other AFM results describe the top surface."

The goal of this paper is to provide a network theoretic explanation of the different paths of Asia and Europe during the postwar period. First, we propose a punctuatedequilibrium model of network diffusion that emphasizes the uncertain nature of diffusion dynamics. Then, we argue that successful regional integration hinges crucially on factors that assure critical mass of countries to embark on a venture of regional integration without fear of exploitation or noncompliance by regional powers in the future. In that regard, we compare the Sino-Japanese relationship in Asia with the Franco-German relationship in Europe, which we call the inter-core relationship, in shaping different paths of regional network diffusion within the two regions. While France and Germany have jointly played pivotal roles in shaping the path to European integration, China and Japan have acted like “two tigers” in the same mountain and missing important opportunities in the 1970s to transform their bilateral relationship. Utilizing the World Treaty Index data set and the community detection method, we found that distinct inter-core relationships in Europe and Asia indeed led to different patterns of evolution in the community structure of bilateral economic networks between Asian and European countries during the postwar period."

The Zernike functions form an orthogonal basis on the unit circle. The complex-valued Zernike expansion coefficients for these two phase masks were derived for use in the context of the Extended Nijboer-Zernike (ENZ) theory of image formation. The ENZ approach is of interest in that it allows a greater range of defocus to be dealt with, provides a simple means of taking a finite source size into account and has been adapted to high Numerical Aperture (NA) imaging applications.Our image plane results for the fractional Hilbert mask were verified against a numerical model implemented in the commercial optical design and analysis code, Zemax®. It was found that the Nijboer- Zernike result converged to the Zemax® result from below as the number of Zernike terms in the expansion was increased."

As a comparison, FEM for this problem is also developed, and the results of the proposed FE program are in good agreement with the analytical ones which demonstrates the reliability of the presented exact and finite element methods. Finally, parametric studies are performed to investigate the influences of parameters including rigidity of shear connectors, ratio of shear modulus and slenderness ratio, on deflections of cantilever composite beams, internal forces and stresses.

Big-data medical image fusion is one of key problems. A new fusion approach with coding based on Spherical Coordinate Domain (SCD) in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for big-data medical image is proposed in this paper. In this approach, the three highfrequency coefficients in wavelet domain of medical image are pre-processed. This pre-processing strategy can reduce the redundant ratio of big-data medical image. Firstly, the high-frequency coefficients are transformed to the spherical coordinate domain to reduce the correlation in the same scale. Then, a multi-scale model product (MSMP) is used to control the shrinkage function so as to make the small wavelet coefficients and some noise removed. The high-frequency parts in spherical coordinate domain are coded by improved SPIHT algorithm. Finally, based on the multi-scale edge of medical image, it can be fused and reconstructed. Experimental results indicate the novel approach is effective and very useful for transmission of big-data medical image(especially, in the wireless environment)."

Numerical values of the energy efficiency, defined as the fraction of the light quantum energy converted to the chemical potential of separated charges, are calculated for low- and high-concentration solutions of such a supramolecular system. The possibility of the efficient utilization of long-wavelength solar radiation in the high-concentration porphyrin-fullerene assembly solution in toluene and benzene is shown. In the photovoltaic system consisting of such a supramolecular active element, a thin ZnO film with a nanostructured surface may be introduced as a secondary acceptor of electrons from fullerene molecules.

The resultant Hilbert spectra demonstrate that the QPO is composed of a series of intermittent signals appearing occasionally. From the analysis of the HHT, we further found the distribution of the lifetimes for the intermittent oscillations and the distribution for the time intervals with no significant signal (the break time). The mean lifetime is 1.45 s and 90% of the oscillation segments have lifetimes less than 3.1 s whereas the mean break time is 0.42 s and 90% of break times are less than 0.73 s. We conclude that the intermittent feature of the QPO could be explained by the Lense-Thirring precession model and rules out interpretations of continual frequency modulation."

The results suggest that Korean labor forces are bi-directionally migrated to China and Japan, simultaneously, and Chinese labor forces have been switched from inflow to outflow. On the other hand, Japanese labor markets are characterized by inflow from Korea, and outflow to China. The nature of labor markets in Northeast Asia have been largely transformed such that inflow of immigrants is gradually intimidated. This is mainly due to the fact that the labor markets are gradually homogenized in this region. To this end, it could be tentatively concluded that the labor markets in Northeast Asia seem to be operated by substitutionary rather than complementary natures."

The job attitude of KORAIL members is an important index to understand and predict an individual behavior in the organization. Furthermore, since the job attitude of its members may affect various performance variables of the organization in the respect of management, it shall be verified and managed.The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the effects of resilence on job satisfaction and organizational commitment. To conduct such examination, the author (i) designated resilence, job satisfaction and organizational commitment as variables and (ii) designed a research model and set up hypotheses by conducting preceding studies on the variables. To examine the hypotheses, the author conducted a survey on members of Gyeongbuk Headquarters of KORAIL and analyzed the survey based on collected 436 copies of questionnaire. Collected data were analyzed using SPSS and AMOS programs, and covariance analysis was conducted to verify the fitness of the study model and the hypotheses.The analysis results are as follows. First, there was a statistically significant relationship between the resilience of the organization members and job satisfaction, organizational commitment. And then the relevant hypothesis was adopted. Second, job satisfaction have been found to be positive effect on organizational commitment.The implications which this study are as follows. First, this study has discovered that resilience had positive effect on job satisfaction, organizational commitment. This result confirms that resilience is the important variables that affect organizational effectiveness. Second, a higher resilience was associated with a higher organizational commitment, offering practical significance in extrapolating the relationship between the positive psychological capital variables held by the individual. In terms of practical implications, first, as organizational confidence is low and conflict between management and labor is severe at KORAIL, there is a need to pay more attention to the positive psychological capital variable of organizational members such as resilience and organizational commitment. Second, the stress levels of organizational members who are swamped with constant measures for management innovation and reduction of the workforce is very high. Given this situation, various training programs and measures that can improve resilience to overcome challenges and stress would be needed and the findings of this study could be used as a rationale for such arguments.This study also has the following limitations: first, this study was conducted based on cross-sectional design of research. It is considered that the objectivity of study results shall be improved in future with interview investigation for major sample groups in order to supplement the weakness of questionnaire survey methods. Second, it is difficult to generalize the results of this study, in that the survey was conducted mainly for members of KORAIL Gyeongbuk headquarters. Thus, the results of this study shall be carefully construed. Third, the measurement scales have their own limitations. It must be noted that a single scale was used for the emotional commitment that included into the organizational commitment. It is considered that the objectivity of study results shall be improved in future with interview investigation for major sample groups in order to supplement the weakness of questionnaire survey methods."

In this paper, we estimates the depth by using the focus measure of the boundary pixels located between the objects in order to minimize the depth estimate time. To detect the boundary of an object consisting of a straight line and a circle, we use the Hough transform and estimate the depth by using the focus measure. We performed various experiments for PCB images and obtained more effective depth estimation results than previous ones."

The nonuniformityof the flow velocity distribution caused by the viscosity of fluid and the small-size effects on the flow field was considered.Euler-Bernoulli beam model was used to investigate flow-induced vibration of the nanotube, while the non-uniformity of the flow velocityand the small-size effects of the flow field were formulated through Knudsen number (Kn), as a discriminant parameter. For laminarflow in a circular nanotube, the momentum correction factor was developed as a function of Kn. For Kn = 0 (continuum flow), the momentumcorrection factor was found to be 1.33, which decreases by the increase in Kn may even reach near 1 for the transition flow regime.We observed that for passage of viscous flow through a nanotube with the non-uniform flow velocity, the critical continuum flowvelocity for divergence decreased considerably as opposed to those for the uniform flow velocity, while by increasing Kn, the differencebetween the uniform and non-uniform flow models may be reduced. In the solution part, the differential transformation method (DTM)was used to solve the governing differential equations of motion."

First, Buddhist meditation through the nature of existence produced from attachment to illusory discrimination (parikalpita-svabhava) in the doctrine of the three natures of cognition considers as one model for psychotherapy to cope with the problems caused from phenomenal painfulness. Second, Buddhist meditation using the nature of existence being perfectly accomplished (parinispanna- svabhava), that is to say, the effort based on the nature of existence arising from causes and conditions (paratantra-svabhava) in the doctrine of the three natures of cognition provides a method for philosophical psychotherapy in terms of individualization and self-realization in the process of Buddhist practice."

일본 근현대의 이궁존덕(二宮尊德)사상의 변용과 모범인물화 양상 -메이지 시대부터 패전 후 GHQ 점령기까지-,2015,"['니노미야 손토쿠', 'Ninomiya Sontoku', '보덕사상', 'Ninomiya Sontoku`s Thought', '일본정신', 'Spirit of Japan', '모범인물', 'a national exemplary person', '보덕사강령', 'Ninomiya Sontoku`s Four Core Ideas']",,"This paper examines how Ninomiya Sontoku’s ideology, which was formed in the Edo period, has been politically transformed and used during the Meiji period, the Showa period and GHQ/SCAP occupation period. In each period the Japanese government made Ninomiya into a role model to reform the nation by portraying him as the ‘ideal’ person. Different aspects of Ninomiya’s thoughts were emphasized in each period. During the course of this paper each aspect of them has been closely examined. Ninomiya’s ideology is often referred to as ‘Houtoku Sisou’ ― the repaying virtue. His ideologies were fundamentally derived from his work on rural rehabilitation and the reconstruction of Bakufu finance. Its foundations are also strongly set in the ideals of making the country prosperous and keeping its people at peace. It regarded the welfare of peasants higher than the attitude of the lord or Bakufu. In the Meiji period, however, the ideology of Ninomiya’s ‘Houtoku’ was transformed into a principle for edifying the nation. It was utilized to generate national wealth and enhance national prosperity. Its aims were to strengthen military power and implement the policies of the imperial system. Later in the Shouwa period the spirit of ‘Houtoku,’ regarded as the same as ‘Japanese spirit,’ was transformed into a belief of loyalty. This encouraged labor mobilization for wars and the devotion of one’s life to the emperor. Making Ninomiya into an ideal figure before the defeat of the World War Ⅱ can be seen as a way of maintaining the regime of Emperor and consolidating imperialism. As described above Ninomiya, as considered the ‘ideal’ person was utilized for indoctrinating of the Japanese empire and as the banner of militarism in the modern Japanese era. It was possible that the characteristics of his thought were based on the ideology of revering the empire and Shintouism. After the defeat of WWⅡ, Ninomiya was idealized into the figure of democracy. This was the outcome of GHQ/SCAP reforming Ninomiya``s ideology to coincide with its democratic policy. It was a recreation of an image that combined the political ideological image of the modern Japan era and democratic image of the contemporary era. In conclusion the biggest reason for transforming Ninomya’s ideology and making him a banner for conflicting political beliefs is that his ideas coincided with each period’ goals. In their desire to manage the country, they prioritized the expansion of national economy and the maintenance of social order. It is well represented that his ideologies were not antiestablishment, valued ``labor`` above everything else and emphasized the returning of wealth accumulated from work and savings to the society. Since his ideology was based on actual life and was practical enough to be used as moral virtues for the whole nation regardless of gender, age or class, it became the obvious route to unite and control public spirit."

Those who reacted first in response to the changing environment of religious activism were Yi Tong’in (1850?-1881), T’ak Ch?ngsik (Mubul), and a few others who emerged from the margins to political significance for three or four years in the late 1870s and early 1880s. These monks were commonly known as kaehwas?ng or “monks of enlightenment” and characterized as “vanguard monks” in this article. In alliance with a group of young political reformers such as Kim Okkyun and Pak Y?nghyo, the activism of these vanguard monks who secured a channel of communication with Honganji Buddhists left an indelible mark on the trajectory of modern Korean Buddhism. In this article, Hur explores how the vanguard monks were connected with progressive political activists, how both groups pursued visions of modern transformation from the model of Meiji Japan, and what implications their activism (which heavily relied upon the nexus of Honganji Buddhism) brought upon the course of Buddhist transformation at the dawn of modern Korea. As it turned out, the Honganji connection cost the scope of the reform vision of both progressive activists and vanguard monks by inducing them into the “enlightenment” cradle of a modern Japan as spearheaded much by the Ch?sh? faction, a big supporter of Honganji Buddhism. Compared to Meiji Japans political leaders and Buddhist activists, the perceptual horizon of Koreas progressive activists and vanguard monks was hamstrung by the channel through which they were exposed to the outside world. As a result, from the outset, the progressive Buddhist activism in Chos?n Korea was destined to suffer from geopolitical parochialism."

The cognitive apprenticeship was found to transform the learning disabled from the passive and marginal learners to the active and full-fledged participants in learning. Their school-life also grew more active through the positive friendship developed among classmates. Some general stages of development were detected in their growing participation in learning: the initial stage of interest in learning was followed by the stage of skills and contents dependency, of skills independence and contents dependence, and finally of skills and contents independence. The stage development, in addition, appeared partly to be associated with three factors: the external factors of apprenticeship learning environments, the internal factors of a sense of achievement, self-confidence, and willingness to participation, and their interactive factors. It seems that some understanding of stages and factors may be required for the successful implementation of apprenticeship model for the learning disabled."

Factors at the teacher-individual level include demographic and social-psychological factors. Factors at the school-organizational level include ecological-environmental and structural-cultural factors.Findings/Results: The major findings are as follows: teachers’ job satisfaction levels are different among schools. Among demographic factors, whether or not teachers are in-charge of their classes, as well as whether or not they play a director’s role has an impact on their job satisfaction levels. Among social-psychological factors, factors that increased teachers’ job satisfaction included: organizational culture, their principal’s transformational leadership, and teachers’ awareness of the Seoul municipal government’s educational strategy. On the contrary, factors that decreased teachers’ job satisfaction levels were teaching creativity, a closed school environment, and a principal’s transactional leadership. Among ecological- environmental factors, the number of classes and students helps to explain teachers’ job satisfaction level; teachers with more classes, but less students show higher job satisfaction levels. And finally, there are no factors that have an impact on teachers’ job satisfaction level among the structural-cultural factors at the school-organizational level.Value: These findings provide suggestions for the development of education policies to improve teacher’s job satisfaction levels."
Efficient Certificate-Based Proxy Re-encryption Scheme forData Sharing in Public Clouds,2015,"['Public cloud storage', 'encrypted data sharing', 'certificate-based proxy re-encryption', 'random oracle model', 'chosen-ciphertext security']",,"Nowadays, public cloud storage is gaining popularity and a growing number of users are beginning to use the public cloud storage for online data storing and sharing. However, how the encrypted data stored in public clouds can be effectively shared becomes a new challenge. Proxy re-encryption is a public-key primitive that can delegate the decryption right from one user to another. In a proxy re-encryption system, a semi-trusted proxy authorized by a data owner is allowed to transform an encrypted data under the data owner`s public key into a re-encrypted data under an authorized recipient`s public key without seeing the underlying plaintext. Hence, the paradigm of proxy re-encryption provides a promising solution to effectively share encrypted data. In this paper, we propose a new certificate-based proxy re-encryption scheme for encrypted data sharing in public clouds. In the random oracle model, we formally prove that the proposed scheme achieves chosen-ciphertext security. The simulation results show that it is more efficient than the previous certificate-based proxy re-encryption schemes."

The larger size of the compensation error from the spine and ribs plot using the radioactive decay equation indicates that there are no benefits in using this equation in standoff compensation. Based on these results, we propose a reverse transform spine and ribs technique by essentially combining the conventional spine and ribs technique and the spine and ribs technique in terms of apparent density."

They are ①Knowledge value adder ②Network learner ③Idea herb ④Idea creator ⑤Vision leader ⑥Vision follower. Finally, I conducted hierarchial linear analysis where independent variables are leadership and expertise. The key conclusions are listed below. Firstly, it turned out that six-roles of key players were highly affected by team-level. In particular, the key players of creative idea network turned out to be most greatly affected by team-level. Secondly, the knowledge value adder and idea herb’s roles were better explained by expertise than leadership while the other key players’ roles were better explained by leadership. Thirdly, ‘team leader’, ‘transformational leadership’, and ‘the number of years of their job’ are significant variables. This study provides the basis for multidimensional views the roles of team learning key players in terms of relationship and their influential factors. With the combination of social network analysis and hierarchical linear analysis, it also is possible to provide more verified and abundant information than existing studies.

Housing Site Development and a Shift in Urban Architecture at Mok-dong in Seou,2015,"['도시건축', '모폴로지', '택지개발사업', '목동 신시가지', '서울', 'urban architecture', 'morphology', 'Housing Site Development(HSD)', 'Mok-dong', 'Seoul']",,"The background, processes and characteristics of changing urban planning paradigms in Seoul can be seen as an essential constituent of Seoul’s urban studies. This paper discusses the transformation of urban form and architecture in Seoul in the 1980s brought on by the emergence of Housing Site Development(HSD), the last major urban planning tool introduced in Korea. Using Mok-dong in Seoul as a model, since it is the first development project based solely on HSD principles, this paper first reviews the socio-political back-ground and characteristics of the HSD project. Second, the macro-spatial structure and micro-urban fabric of Mok-dong are analyzed and compared with an adjacent area con-structed under the previous major urban planning tool—Land Readjustment(LR). This analysis combines an understanding of the programmatic architectural requirements with an awareness of the external urban circumstances in Seoul in order to arrive at a clearer un-derstanding of the character of Seoul’s urban architecture. While the Mok-dong plan was based on the winning scheme from a public design competition, the detailed land use plan and land subdivision plan saw significant divergence from the original scheme as a result of economic changes and market demand in the city. The geometric qualities of the land ‘grid’ found in LR development projects disappeared in the HSD layout of the apartment complex(danji), while the grid patterned blocks and plots in the business and commercial districts were significantly augmented. The increase in scale of the urban components yielded larger and higher building typologies. Consequently, the medium-rise buildings in the more compact LR areas of adjacent Sinjeong-4-dong stand in sharp contrast to—and perhaps even in the shadows of—the high-rise apartments and the business and commer-cial towers at Mok-dong. There, the relationship of the buildings to street orientation is linked to the divergence of ‘thin’ and ‘thick’ building plans, where narrowing and elongat-ing was favored in the apartment buildings, while squaring or ‘thickening’ was preferred for the commercial buildings. These morphological findings may not point directly to an alternative conceptualization of urban architecture, but they could be the foundation on which to build a theory about Seoul’s architecture and urbanism as it relates to the lived identity of the city."

여성주의 논의 확장을 통한 ‘아동중심적’ 아동돌봄 제도로의 패러다임 전환 모색,2015,"['아동돌봄 제도화', '아동중심성', '아동관점', '여성주의', '후기 근대', 'childcare institutionalization', 'child-centeredness', ""child's perspective"", 'feminism', 'post-modern']","본 논문은 여성의 경제활동참여로 인한 근대적인 남성 생계부양 가족 모델의 붕괴로 한국 사회가 직면하고 있는 아동돌봄 제도화의 도전이 무엇인지, 어떤 제도적 변화가 필요한지 여성주의 관점에서 논의한다. 특히 본 논문에서 여성주의 관점은 여성문제뿐 아니라 아동문제를 함께 논의하는 이론적 자원이 된다. 여성의 경제활동참여 증가를 어떻게 보는가에 따라 아동돌봄 제도를 근대적 틀로 유지할지, 후기 근대적인 새로운 패러다임으로 전환할 지의 두 가지 선택을 갖는다. 한국은 현재 근대적 젠더질서가 쇠퇴하는 징후들을 보면서도 후기 근대적 패러다임으로의 변화를 지연시키고 있는데, 성평등과 아동복리를 위해서는 후기 근대적 탈 성별분업 통념의 젠더질서를 기반으로 하는 아동돌봄 제도로 패러다임을 전환해야 한다. 또한 본 연구는 이러한 아동 관점의 후기 근대적 아동돌봄 제도화의 기반이 되는 사회적 합의로 아동중심성을 제안하며, 아동중심성은 아동의 관점, 시민으로서의 아동, 아동기 자체로서 중요한 ‘지금 여기서’의 특성을 갖는다.","This study aims to discuss the challenges in childcare institutionalization that Korean society is facing due to the dismantling of the modern male breadwinner family model and the institutional transformation required from a feminist perspective. In particular, the feminist perspective is viewed as a theoretical asset which encompasses not only gender equality but also child well-being. In Korean society, two choices are available in terms of how we see the increase in women's economic participation. These choices involve either maintaining the modern childcare paradigm or shifting to a new post-modern paradigm. The Korean government is delaying a shift to the post-modern paradigm despite the evidence of the dismantling of the modern gender order. However, for the sake of both gender equality and child's well-being, Korean society needs to shift to the post-modern paradigm. This study also presents a new social consensus of 'child centeredness' that can form the basis of the post-modern childcare paradigm while replacing the modern patriarchal conventional wisdom of gendered division of labor based on three characteristics such as child's perspective, recognition of children as citizens, the 'here and now' perspective that values childhood itself rather than seeing it as a preparatory period."

Flow theory and its model indicate that these two variables have to be understood dynamically, and considered simultaneously, to estimate the state and level of Optimal Experience. Flow theory and its model are based upon the premise that the level of Perceived Challenge and Perceived Skill are resultants from the psychological and behavioral responses from the Optimal Arousal Seeking Drive, which has intensityand direction. However, previous research in the field of adventure tourism has not considered these two variables as Drives, and has only considered either Perceived Challenge, or Perceived Skill separately. To date these two variables have not been considered simultaneously. It is the purpose of this research to examine the influence of the levels of Perceived Challenge and Skill on Optimal Experience in Adventure Tourism Participants within the snowboarder population. The results indicate Perceived Challenge level significantly influence on Concentration, Merging of Action & Awareness, Transformation of Time, and Paradox of Control factors among Optimal Experience. However, Perceived Skill level significantly influence on Paradox of Control only. Interaction of the Perceived Challenge and Perceived Skill levels significantly positive influence on Concentration. Moreover, Optimal Experience level showed regular patterns of intensity and direction through Perceived Challenge and Perceived Skill levels."

Removal of Co(II) from aqueous solutions by sulfonated magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes,2015,"['Co(II)', 'Sorption', 'Sulfonated Magnetic Multi-walled Carbon Nnanotubes']",,"Sulfonated magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SMMWCNTs) were applied in the sorption of Co(II) from aqueous solutions. The SMMWCNTs were prepared and characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) test. A large number of influencing factors to the sorption process were investigated, such as pH, ionic strength, contact time, cations, anions, humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA) and temperature. The results indicated that the Co(II) sorption was strongly controlled by the pH and ionic strength. Moreover, foreign anions, such as F−, Cl− and Br−, had an obvious effect on the sorption process, which depended on the electronegativity of the anions. On the other hand, cations restrained sorption strongly, such as Mg2+ and Ca2+. The existence of HA/FA enhanced sorption process at pH<8 while weakened at pH>8. As revealed by the sorption results, the Langmuir adsorption model was more favorable than the Freundlich adsorption model, and the pseudo-second-order model could fit the data much better than the pseudo-first-order. The thermodynamic analysis suggested that sorption was spontaneous and endothermic. What’s more, the stability experiments of the SMMWCNTs showed that SMMWCNTs could maintain excellent magnetic stability and dispersion stability. Thus, this SMMWCNTs sorbent was believed to be a promising material for the selective removal of Co(II) from heavy metal-containing wastewater."

Simplexlattice design has been chosen to develop model equations that correlate the process variables such as HPβCD (mg),TA (mg), and kneading time (min) with the response variables, such as solubility (mg/mL) and drug release (%) fromthe solid dispersion. Software-generated ANOVA results confirmed the sufficiency of model equations. Results pre-dicted by model equations are in good agreement with that of experimental results. Optimized formulation with vari-ables ‘CV: HPβCD: TA-kneading time’ (200mg: 689.6mg: 227.6mg-45min) showed complete drug release (~99%)within 15min and enhanced solubility of 1.89mg/mL. The instrumental analysis (DSC, XRD& FTIR) of the opti-mized solid dispersion suggests a transformation of crystallinity of drug to amorphous form, due to its complexationwith HPβCD. Hence, this combination of drug and carriers suggests an improvement of carvedilol bioavailability."

Accordingly, a growing number of empirical works support the positive impact of industrial clusters on firm innovation or performance mainly by investigating differences in innovation and performance between clustering and non-clustering firms. These works have mainly focused on figuring out exogenous factors of clusters, such as infrastructural resources, labor pools, and local endowments, originating externally. However, the success of clustering firms also depends on endogenous factors including formal economic transactions and social interactions for the exchange of knowledge and information among members within industrial clusters. Although previous study has argued that firms are able to benefit from the knowledge spillover of the clusters, referring to learning regions, it is unreasonable to simply assume that positioning in the clusters would lead to active knowledge exchange among cluster members. In this context, organizational leaning is regarded as an effective instrument allowing firms to acquire, exploit, and refine external knowledge contributing to business performance. Despite the importance of organizational learning in clustering firms, our understanding of which learning initiatives are needed for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to take advantage of the spillover effect of industrial clusters has fallen short of practical and research demands. The primary purpose of this study is to empirically examine the possible linkages among industrial cluster involvement, organizational learning capability, and firm performance of clustering SMEs. Starting from reviewing the literature and its limitations, we propose research hypotheses as two fold: (1) clustering SMEs possessing high levels of industrial cluster involvement and organizational learning capability would produce better performance in business than those who do not, and (2) clustering firms’ capability for organizational learning would play a pathway linking between their involvement in industrial cluster and performance. In a sample of 258 SMEs within industrial clusters in Korea, we tested the structured research model consisting of traded and untraded interdependences for industrial cluster involvement, absorptive and transformative capability for organizational learning capability, and firm performance through hierarchical regression analysis. The results revealed that traded and untraded interdependences, the two constructs of industrial cluster involvement had positive effect on firm performance. The positive linkage of organizational learning capability, represented by absorptive and transformative capability, with firm performance was also confirmed. It was notable that organizational learning capability mediated fully the positive linkage between firms’ involvement in industrial clusters and performance. The primary contribution of this study is its attempt to provide a comprehensive approach in analyzing SMEs’ industrial cluster involvement in terms of their traded and untraded interdependences. Moreover, this study expands upon the importance of enhancing organizational learning and relevant capabilities from the perspective of clustering SMEs. Detailed implication and contribution of this study are discussed in the conclusions."

Housing Site Development and a Shift in Urban Architecture at Mok-dong in Seoul,2015,"['urban architecture', 'morphology', 'Housing Site Development(HSD)', 'Mok-dong', 'Seoul', '도시건축', '모폴로지', '택지개발사업', '목동 신시가지', '서울']",,"The background, processes and characteristics of changing urban planning paradigms in Seoul can be seen as an essential constituent of Seoul’s urban studies. This paper discusses the transformation of urban form and architecture in Seoul in the 1980s brought on by the emergence of Housing Site Development(HSD), the last major urban planning tool introduced in Korea. Using Mok-dong in Seoul as a model, since it is the first development project based solely on HSD principles, this paper first reviews the socio-political background and characteristics of the HSD project. Second, the macro-spatial structure and micro-urban fabric of Mok-dong are analyzed and compared with an adjacent area constructed under the previous major urban planning tool-Land Readjustment(LR). This analysis combines an understanding of the programmatic architectural requirements with an awareness of the external urban circumstances in Seoul in order to arrive at a clearer understanding of the character of Seoul’s urban architecture. While the Mok-dong plan was based on the winning scheme from a public design competition, the detailed land use plan and land subdivision plan saw significant divergence from the original scheme as a result of economic changes and market demand in the city. The geometric qualities of the land ‘grid’ found in LR development projects disappeared in the HSD layout of the apartment complex(danji), while the grid patterned blocks and plots in the business and commercial districts were significantly augmented. The increase in scale of the urban components yielded larger and higher building typologies. Consequently, the medium-rise buildings in the more compact LR areas of adjacent Sinjeong-4-dong stand in sharp contrast to-and perhaps even in the shadows of-the high-rise apartments and the business and commercial towers at Mok-dong. There, the relationship of the buildings to street orientation is linked to the divergence of ‘thin’ and ‘thick’ building plans, where narrowing and elongating was favored in the apartment buildings, while squaring or ‘thickening’ was preferred for the commercial buildings. These morphological findings may not point directly to an alternative conceptualization of urban architecture, but they could be the foundation on which to build a theory about Seoul’s architecture and urbanism as it relates to the lived identity of the city."

The thermal characteristicsand the structural transformations of the BKSO glass have been studied by means of adifferential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction. The crystallization of BKSO glass is found toaccompany a single-step occurrence of a tetragonal Ba3TiNb4O15 nanocrystal structure. Duringthe crystallization, a nanocrystals with a size of ∼40 nm at the initial stage grow with increasingtemperature and reach a size of ∼120 nm by the time the crystallization finishes. We usethe non-isothermal model of Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov to characterize the kinetics of thecrystallization process for the BKSO glass. The Avrami exponent of 3.5 indicates that the crystallizationmechanisms is an increasing nucleation rate with diffusion-controlled growth. In the viewof applications, providing information on how to control the size of nanograins systematically bysimply controlling the annealing temperature of the glass state, as described in this study, shouldbe useful."
Using AQM for Performance Improvement of Networked Control Systems,2015,"['Active queue management', 'linear matrix inequality', 'networked control systems', 'state-dependent delay differential equation']",,"This paper presents a new scheme to jointly control the plant and the network to improve the overall performance of the networked control system (NCS). Using an analytical transmission control protocol (TCP) model for the network, an active queue management (AQM) is designed to achieve desired queue length. This leads to keeping network induced delay and its variation to be small enough to improve the overall performance of the NCSs. By augmenting the TCP communication model with the control system equations, the closed loop system is transformed to a state-dependent delay differential equation (SDDDE). Then using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii method, a sufficient condition for the stability of this class of systems is presented in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Simulation results are presented and compared to some other methods, the superiority of the proposed approach is shown."

Heat shock protein X purified from Mycobacterium tuberculosis enhances the efficacy of dendritic cells-based immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic asthma,2015,"['Asthma', 'Dendritic cells', 'GATA-3', 'HspX', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'T-bet']",,"Dendritic cells play an important role in determining whether naive T cells mature into either Th1 or Th2 cells. We determined whether heat-shock protein X (HspX) purified from Mycobacterium tuberculosis regulates the Th1/Th2 immune response in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine model of asthma. HspX increased interferon-gamma, IL-17A, -12 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-b production and T-bet gene expression but reduced IL-13 production and GATA-3 gene expression. HspX also inhibited asthmatic reactions as demonstrated by an increase in the number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissues, airway luminal narrowing, and airway hyper-responsiveness. Furthermore, HspX enhanced OVA-induced decrease of regulatory T cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes.

영국 근대경찰의 형성에 관한 연구 - 전통주의와 수정주의 관점 -,2015,"['영국', '근대경찰', '런던수도경찰', '전통주의', '수정주의', 'England', 'Modern Police', 'London Metropolitan Police', 'Traditionalism', 'Revisionism']","이 글에서는 영국 근대경찰의 형성(즉, 런던수도경찰 1829년)과정과 관련된 논점들을 전통주의(傳統主義, Traditionalism)와 수정주의(修正主義, Revisionism) 관점에서 논의하고자 하였다. 이를 위해서 근대경찰의 개념을 제도적 관점과 이념적 관점에서 차원에서 정립하였고, 전통주의와 수정주의에 의한 경찰발전모델을 바탕으로 크게 네가지 차원에서 이의 특징을 살펴보았다. 첫째, 근대경찰의 설립배경에 대해서 살펴보았다. 전통주의자들은 의심의 여지없이근대경찰은 산업화・도시화에서 비롯된 범죄와 무질서 문제에 대응하기 위해서 비롯된 것이라고 보고 있다. 반면, 수정주의자들은 이러한 산업화・도시화가 특히 ‘자본주의’의 틀 속에서 일어났다는 점을 강조하고 있다. 자본주의사회의 지배계층은 자신들의 자산과 권력을 유지하기 위해서 사회통제를 강화하였다는 것이다. 둘째, 근대경찰의 창설의 반대운동에 대해서 살펴보았다. 전통주의자들은 귀족적인 보수당 내의사람들과 노동계급의 급진파 등이 영국인의 전통적인 자유권이 새로운 경찰로 인해침해될 것을 우려하여 반대하였다고 보았다. 반면 수정주의자들은 이러한 반대는 전통적 계급사회의 지주계급에서 시작되었는데, 곧 소멸되었고, 특히, 노동계급이 뿌리깊은 반대운동을 하였다고 보았다. 셋째, 근대경찰의 특징에 대해서 살펴보았다. 전통주의자들은 근대경찰은 지금까지 유래가 없는 능률성과 청렴성을 가지고 있으며, 아울러 전통사회의 자경주의에 뿌리를 두고 있다고 보았다. 반면, 수정주의자들은 이보다는 지배계급의 생명과 재산을 보호하기 위하여 위험한 계급(즉, 가난한 사람들과노동계급)에 대한 통제강화에서 찾고 있다. 마지막으로, 근대경찰의 도입 성과에 대해서 살펴보았다. 전통주의자들은 근대경찰이 등장함으로써 범죄와 무질서문제가 상당부분 해결되고, 더 나아가 국가발전이 이루어졌다고 보았다. 수정주의자들은 이 보다는 사회질서가 ‘경찰이 통제하는 사회’로 변모하였다는 점 등을 지적하였다. 주지하는 바와 같이 전통주의 관점이 종래의 근대경찰에 대한 통상적인 인식체계였다면, 수정주의는 이에 대한 다소 비판적인 관점에서 논의를 전개하였음을 알 수 있다. 생각건대, 이러한 양자의 접근을 통해서 어떠한 ‘옳고 그름’을 규명하자는 것은결코 아니다. 오히려 전통주의 관점에 수정주의 관점을 결합하여 확대된 근대경찰의인식의 틀을 갖는 계기가 될 것으로 기대한다.","In here, I tried to discussed the issues related to the process of establishment for the England modern police(that is, London Metropolitan Police in 1829) in the view of traditionalism and revisionism. For this, I named the concept of modern police in the institutional and ideological perspectives, and observed the features of modern police in the four points based by the traditionalism and revisionism. First, discussed the background of establishment. Crime and disorder, those consequences of industrialisation and urbanisation which the traditionalists identified as the basic demand for the modern police. On the other hand, industrialisation and urbanisation as the fundamental sources, of the demand for a new police, the revisionists adds that both processes occurred within a specifically capitalist framework. Capitalism require a tighter disciplining of hitherto relatively loosely regulated aspects of social relations. Second, discussed the opposition movements. The traditionalists think that aristocratic Tories and working-class radical alike protest the establishment of the police for the reason which encroach the supposed traditional liberties of Englishmen. The revisionists observe the initial opposition did come from the traditional landed gentry but distinguished soon. But the deepest source of opposition to the new police came form the working class. Third, discussed the characteristics. The traditionalists argue that the modern police was a novel creation in terms of efficiency and integrity, and it had roots in ancient traditions of communal self-policing. The revisionists think about the new police that they were a bureaucratically organised force charged with a mandate to prevent crime by regular patrol and surveillance of the whole society(but, especially the denizens of the 'dangerous class). Finally, account the accomplishments. In the traditionalists accounts, the social impact of the police was the clearly benign one of solving the crime and disorder, and attribute to national development. In the revisionists account the advent of the modern police transformed the social order into a 'policed society'. As everyone knows, the traditionalism's views are the general perspectives about the development of the modern police, but the revisionism's have the critical points about it. In my opinion, I never intend to reveal 'the right and wrong' for this approach. Instead, combine the two perspectives, expect to have the extended frame of recognition about the modern police."
Application of response surface methodology to the decolorization by the electrochemical process using FePMo12O40 catalyst,2015,"['Response surface methodology', 'Electrochemical oxidation', 'Polyoxometalate', 'Azo dye']",,"In order to optimize the experimental conditions, the decolorization of Acid Red 3R by electrochemicaloxidation process with catalyst FePMo12-APS-MS4A as packing was performed using response surfacemethodology (RSM). The microstructure and morphology of FePMo12-APS-MS4A were characterizedwith Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). Four control factors were throughlyanalyzed by means of RSM based on Box–Behnken design (BBD). Taking the decolorization efficiency asresponse value, a second order polynomial model was established. The model and analysis stronglyindicated that the cell voltage and airflow caused positive, and the initial pH and inter-electrode distancecaused negative effect on the decolorization efficiency. The interaction between cell voltage and initialpH, initial pH and airflow were also revealed. Under the optimal conditions, the color, COD and TOCremoval efficiency reached 67.3%, 58.4% and 47.9% after 60 min.

This study extends Banks’s (2001) Four Approaches to Multicultural Curriculum Reform by contextualizing his model to South Korean elementary teachers’ implementation of multicultural curriculum cases. Data collection included in-depth interviews with six elementary teachers. Three implementation patterns for a multicultural curriculum were found, but the social action approach was not utilized by the teachers. In regards to teachers’ learning experiences, the textbook-oriented approach, the goal-additive approach, and the perspective-transformative approach were respectively related to: (a) experience of working with ethnic/cultural minority students, participating in lecture-centered multicultural teacher education, and sharing teaching materials; (b) experience of participating in discussion-centered multicultural teacher education, developing multicultural lessons collaboratively, and engaging in cooperative problem-solving practices; and (c) experience of participating in inquiry-based teaching practices. Based on these findings, implications for multicultural teacher education programs were suggested."
Research and Experimental Implementation of a CV-FOINC Algorithm Using MPPT for PV Power System,2015,"['Constant voltage', 'Fraction order incremental conductance', 'Maximum power point tracking', 'Photovoltaic power system and fractional order differentiator']",,"This research suggests maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for the solar photovoltaic (PV) power scheme using a new constant voltage (CV) fractional order incremental conductance (FOINC) algorithm. The PV panel has low transformation efficiency and power output of PV panel depends on the change in weather conditions. Possible extracting power can be raised to a battery load utilizing a MPPT algorithm. Among all the MPPT strategies, the incremental conductance (INC) algorithm is mostly employed due to easy implementation, less fluctuations and faster tracking, which is not only has the merits of INC, fractional order can deliver a dynamic mathematical modelling to define non-linear physiognomies. CV-FOINC variation as dynamic variable is exploited to regulate the PV power toward the peak operating point. For a lesser scale photovoltaic conversion scheme, the suggested technique is validated by simulation with dissimilar operating conditions. Contributions are made in numerous aspects of the entire system, including new control algorithm design, system simulation, converter design, programming into simulation environment and experimental setup. The results confirm that the small tracking period and practicality in tracking of photovoltaic array."

To effectively remove the effect of sensor noise, we transform the original model considered here into the descriptor form system. To effectively remove the effect of sensor noise, the original system is transformed into the descriptor system. Provided the variation of disturbance in the two consecutive sampling instances is not changed significantly and the system matrices satisfy the certain conditions, both the system state and the unknown input can be simultaneously estimated by the proposed proportional-integral-derivative observer algorithm. The estimation error can be constrained in a small bounded region of the order of O(T) where T is the sampling rate. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed observer scheme."
New insights into corona discharge surface ionization of polyethylene terephthalate via a combined computational and experimental assessment,2015,"['Corona discharge process', 'Polyethylene terephthalate', 'Computational chemistry', 'IR spectra']",,"The aim of the present work is to demonstrate the influence of corona discharge ionization on chemical and physical properties of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers using computational and experimental studies. In the computational section, the vibrational frequencies of proposed models for PET before and after corona discharge treatment were predicted in the liquid phase at both the B3LYP/6-31G/COSMO and B3PW91/6-31G/COSMO level of theories using the harmonic approximation. When compared to B3LYP, the frequencies obtained for the B3PW91 show a better linear correlation with the experimental data. Furthermore, experimental studies were carried out by the use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and reflectance spectroscopy (RS). Experimental evidence indicated that the corona discharge modifies the surface of fibers and also increases the reactivity of PET toward cationic dyes. Our combined computational and experimental parametric study clearly confirms that the changes occurred on the PET surface due to corona discharge ionization."
Research on simulation and experiment for surface topography machined by a novel point grinding wheel,2015,"['Point grinding', 'Geometrical simulation', 'Surface topography', 'Processing parameters', 'Novel grinding wheel']",,"Grains motion path will be changed in the point grinding process due to the existence of variable angle α. To verify the difference betweenpoint grinding and traditional grinding, the moving relationship and coordinate transformation between grinding wheel and workpieceare used to put the grain movement function equivalent to parabola, then point grinding cutting path is concluded. Based on grainsdistribution on the grinding wheel surface, the 3D geometry simulation topography of workpiece is obtained by extending the effectiveinterference trails along the axial direction. Furthermore, a vitrified bond CBN wheel with a coarse grinding area angle θ is proposed andthe principle of design and preparation of these novel grinding wheels are studied. The typical processing parameters are chosen to grindQT700 ladder shaft; the simulation results are verified by using the VHX-1000E microscope and the non-contact 3D surface profilometerto observe the workpiece surface topography and measure the surface roughness. The results indicated that the simulation microstructurescoincide well with the experimental measurements and the values of simulation roughness are 0.5 times of experiments. So, the geometricsimulation model provided an auxiliary and prediction method for the actual processing topography analysis. In addition, grindingwheels with different θ are used to grind ladder shafts with a series of grinding parameters. The influence trend of inclining angle α, cuttingdepth ap, axial feeding speed vf and grinding wheel speed vs on surface roughness is obtained. It is concluded that the values ofworkpiece surface roughness using novel grinding wheel are less than using the traditional grinding wheel under the condition of thesame processing parameters."

Random vibration analysis of train-slab track-bridge coupling system under earthquakes,2015,"['train-slab track-bridge interaction', 'random vibration', 'pseudo-excitation method', 'earthquake', 'track irregularity']",,"This study aimed to investigate the random vibration characteristic of train-slab track-bridge interaction system subjected to both track irregularities and earthquakes by use of pseudo-excitation method (PEM). Each vehicle subsystem was modeled by multibody dynamics. A three-dimensional rail-slabgirder-pier finite element model was created to simulate slab track and bridge subsystem. The equations of motion for the entire system were established based on the constraint condition of no jump between wheel and rail. The random load vectors of equations of motion were formulated by transforming track irregularities and seismic accelerations into a series of deterministic pseudo-excitations according to their respective power spectral density (PSD) functions by means of PEM. The time-dependent PSDs of random vibration responses of the system were obtained by step-by-step integration method, and the corresponding extreme values were estimated based on the first-passage failure criterion. As a case study, an ICE3 high-speed train passing a fifteen-span simply supported girder bridge simultaneously excited by track irregularities and earthquakes is presented. The evaluated extreme values and the PSD characteristic of the random vibration responses of bridge and train are analyzed, and the influences of train speed and track irregularities (without earthquakes) on the random vibration characteristic of bridge and train are discussed."

This paper attempts to fill this void by providing a comparative case study of the BSS in four Korean cities. It finds that mayoral willingness and commitment to the promotion of a BSS as an environmental policy and the number of their consecutive terms in office explain the variation among them in terms of the stability and effectiveness of BSS in Korea. For the further development of BSS, strengthening civil society and the role of the city council is necessary to transform the current top-down governance structure of BSS into a more bottom-up style of governance."

Effects of the Chain Length of Tris(carboxyalkylamino)triazine on Corrosion Inhibition Properties,2015,"['Acid solutions', 'EIS', 'Polarization', 'Interface', 'Corrosion']",,"The corrosion behavior of mild steel was studied in 1M HCl solution containing varying amounts of triazine derivatives having amine groups and alkyl carboxylic acid groups. The synthesized triazine derivatives were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, NMR, mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis (EA), and their corrosion inhibition properties were determined by potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. We found that the triazine derivatives acted as mixed-type inhibitors by their adsorption on the metal surface. We also proposed that the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model could be used to explain the adsorption of triazine derivatives. In addition, when the alkyl chain length of the triazine derivative was relatively long, we also obtained a high-adsorption equilibrium constant and low Gibbs free energy of adsorption. Thus, we conclude that the alkyl chain length plays an important role in the corrosion inhibition properties of triazine derivatives."

Focus is given to animal alternative test methods, i.e., in vitro, and in chemico assays as well as in vivo. 3T3 neutral red uptake assay, erythrocyte photohemolysis test, and phototoxicity test using human 3-dimensional (3D) epidermis model are examples of in vitro assays. In chemico methods evaluate the generation of reactive oxygen species or DNA strand break activity employing plasmid for chemicals, or drugs with phototoxic potential."

The reused nanocomposites presented the decreasing antibacterial efficiencies with the reuse cycle but the composite used three times still killed 90% of bacteria in 20 min."
리더십 유형과 감성지능이 조직시민행동에 미치는 영향에 관한 연구,2015,"['리더십유형', '감성지능', '조직시민행동', '중소기업', 'leadership style', 'emotional intelligence', 'organizational citizenship behaviour', 'small and medium-sized firms']","본 연구의 목적은 우리나라 중소기업들이 규모가 큰 대기업들과 경쟁하기 위하여 어떻게 해야만 내부 구성원들의 조직시민행동을 극대화 할 수 있는지를 살펴보고자 하는 데에 있다. 본 연구를 통해서, 우리나라 중소기업들에 적용해야 할 리더십 유형과 감성지능의 모형을 제시하여 우리나라 중소기업의 경쟁력을 제고 시키고자 한다. 이를 위해 본 연구에서는 리더십 유형을 3가지로 분류하였으며 감성지능을 매개로 하여 조직시민 행동을 측정하는 실증연구로 진행하였다. 실증연구 결과를 요약하면 다음과 같다. 첫째, 거래적 리더십이 타인감성 이해에 가장 큰 영향력을 미치는 것으로 나타났다. 둘째, 변혁적 리더십이 감성활용에 가장 큰 영향력을 미치는 것으로 나타났다. 셋째, 서번트 리더십이 타인감성 이해에 가장 큰 영향력을 미치는 것으로 나타났다. 넷째, 감성활용이 조직시민행동에 가장 큰 영향력을 미치는 것으로 나타났다. 중소기업에 적용하는 리더십유형의 영향력 크기를 비교했을 때 본 연구에서는 거래적 리더십이 자기감성활용, 타인감성이해를 매개하여 조직시민행동에 가장 큰 영향력을 미치는 것으로 나타났다. 이러한 연구결과는 기존 Bass(1985), Niehoff & Moorman(1993)이 주장한 변혁적 리더십이 조직시민행동에 더 큰 영향을 미친다는 연구결과와 상이한 것으로 우리나라 중소기업의 특징을 알려주는 의미 있는 자료라 생각되며, 이러한 결과는 임금, 복리후생 등에서 대기업들과는 차별화가 발생되어 이에 대한 보상차원의 성격이 거래적 리더십의 효과를 더 높인 것으로 볼 수 있을 것이다.","The purpose of this study is to investigate how to maximize organizational citizenship behavior of the union in small and medium-sized business so as to compete with large companies. In this paper, we suggest the ways to improve competitiveness of Korean small and middle-sized business by developing the model of emotional intelligence and leadership. We classified the leadership into three types and examined the organizational citizenship behavior by using the emotional stimulus as a moderating variable. Through the empirical study, we firstly find that the transactional leadership is the most influential on understanding the other``s emotion. Secondly, transformational leadership mostly influences the utilization of emotion among the factors in the emotional intelligence. Thirdly, the servant leadership is the most influential on the other``s emotional appraisal among the elements of emotional intelligence. Fourthly, the utilization of emotion is the most influential on the organizational citizenship behaviour. Among different leadership styles, the transactional leadership is the mostly influencing on the organizational citizenship behaviour through the utilization of emotion and the other``s emotional appraisal in small and medium-sized companies. This result is not concurrent with the study of Bass(1985), Niehoff & Moorman(1993), showing that the transformational leadership is the most influential on the organizational citizenship behaviour. It quite meaningfully shows how Korean small and medium-sized companies are different from those of large companies corporations. The relative significance of transactional leadership is partly due to the recognizable differences of salary, benefits and social recognition between small and medium-sized firms and large companies."
현장과 육체 - 『창작과비평』의 민중지향성 분석,2015,"['Changbi', 'Minjung', 'Minjung-oriented literary criticism', 'spirit of Minjung', 'Baek Nak-cheong', 'Yom Mu-ung', 'Shin Kyung-lim', 'Heidegger', 'field of lives', 'body', 'dialect', '『창작과비평』', '민중', '민중문학론', '민중지향성', '민중의식', '백낙청', '염무웅', '신경림', '하이데거', '유신체제', '현장', '육체', '사투리(방언)']","이 글은 『창비』의 민중문학담론이 민중의 ‘현장’과 ‘육체’를 재현하는 방식을 본격적으로 검토한 것이다. ‘민중지향성’이라는 이들의 모토가 실제로는 누가 무엇을 왜 지향하는지 알려주지 않는다는 점에 착안하여, 민중지향성이 그려 놓은 이념의 궤적을 따라가기보다는 민중지향성이라는 의장(擬裝) 아래 감추어진 비평가의 시선과 욕망을 분석하고자 했다. 2장에서는 ‘민중’이라는 용어가 1970~80년대 문학ㆍ학술 담론장에서 어떠한 위상의 변모를 겪어왔는지를 백낙청, 김명인, 정과리의 글을 중심으로 간략히 살펴보았다. 그러나 이 시기 민중지향성의 이론적 안테나에 잡힌 여러 개념들을 순차적으로 정리하는 작업은 민중지향성이 발생시킨 특유의 미학적 파토스를 포착하는 데까지 나아가지 못한다는 판단에 따라, 3장에서는 『창비』의 민중문학담론이 민중의 현장과 육체를 과소/과잉 재현하는 특수한 계기들을 분석하는 데 집중했다. 그 결과, 『창비』 특유의 민중문학론은 역사학계가 발견한 민중의식의 전폭적 수용과 민중적 삶의 현장에 대한 강한 애착이 결합된 형태로 출발했음을 알 수 있었다. 전통에 밝지 못했던 백낙청, 염무웅, 신경림, 이선영, 구중서 등은 역사학자들이 발견한 (과거) 민중의식에 꼭 맞는 (현재) 민중의 몸이 비루하고 너절한 삶의 현장에 존재한다고 믿었다. 그것은 양심 있는 지식인이라면 모름지기 현장을 알아야 한다는 시대의 당위적 요청에 이들이 매우 정직하게 반응했기 때문이다. 삶의 현장에 진리가 주어져 있다는 믿음을 기반으로, 이들은 가난과 폭력으로 피폐해진 민중적 삶의 현장에서 건강과 순수를 찾았고, 특히 민중이 구사하는 사투리(토속어)와 비속어에 따뜻하면서도 활기찬 민중의식이 담겨있다고 판단했다. 흥미로운 사실은, 건강한 민중의식이 민중의 목소리에 현전한다는 이들의 주장에서 데리다의 정밀한 독법에 따라 내파된 바 있는 형이상학적 사유의 편린들을 발견하게 된다는 점이다. 여기서 우리는 어떤 뚜렷한 모순을 발견하게 된다. 즉, 『창비』의 민중문학론자들은 민중문학을 구성하는 요소로 자신들이 꼽은 온갖 형이하학적 삶의 요소들에 다름 아닌 형이상학적 지위를 부여한 것이다. 『창비』의 민중지향성이 안고 있는 이러한 모순과 불투명성에도 불구하고 『창비』는 1970년대 문학ㆍ학술운동의 주류에서 한 번도 벗어나지 않았다. 그것은 『창비』라는 잡지 자체의 운명이 유신체제를 살아가는 민중적 몸의 현현이었기 때문일 것이다. 저항정신, 불굴의 의지, 건강성, 생명력, 포용력이라는 민중의식이 엄혹한 현실에 안착할 수 있게 한 몸은 다름 아닌 『창비』라는 잡지 자체였다. 유신체제하 『창비』에게는 잡지 출간이야말로 그 잡지가 주장하는 특별한 권리였을 것이다. ‘민중적 몸의 현현으로서의 잡지’ 발간이라는 1970년대적 상황을 고려하지 않는다면 민중지향성이라는 용어는 애초의 그 불투명성을 그대로 고수해야 할는지 모른다.","This paper explores the way in which Changbi’s Minjung-oriented literary criticism represent Minjung’s field of lives and their bodies. In this paper, I attempt to analyse unique gaze and desire of Changbi’s Minjung-oriented literary critics. Chapter II deals with the development and transformation of the term ‘Minjung’ in the literary as well as academic field paying attention to the writings of major critics such as Baek Nak-cheong, Yom Mu-ung, and Shin Kyung-lim. In chapter III, I discuss what motivated them to over/underrepresent Minjung’s field of lives and their bodies. They believe that they can find out the best model for sound body and spirit of Minjung in mean and shabby places in Korean society. According to them, true spirit of Minjung are present in various dialects and slangs they speak in everyday lives. Interestingly enough, their concern with physical materials including Minjung’s voice remind us of Heidegger’s metaphysical thinking of presence what Derrida tried to deconstruct in his philosophical investigations. Although there is explicit inconsistency in Changbi’s Minjung-oriented literary criticism, Changbi played a key role in building, spreading, and supporting progressive thoughts in Korean society. It is the specific circumstance where Changbi can be the manifestation of the oppressed but energetic body of Minjung that made Changbi the most influential media in Korean history."
Sorption enhancement of TBBPA from water by fly ash-supported nanostructured g-MnO2,2015,"['TBBPA', 'Fly ash', 'Nanostructured', 'MnO2', 'Adsorption mechanism']",,"Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), an emerging contaminant, has been detected frequently in theenvironmental media. This study reports the adsorption kinetics, equilibrium and thermodynamics ofTBBPA on fly ash modified by nanostructured MnO2 (FA@nM). The resulting nano-adsorbent wascharacterized by means of the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), XRD and scanning electronmicroscope (SEM). The adsorption results showed that the equilibrium adsorption capacity has beensignificantly improved by increasing the initial TBBPA concentration and contact time. While a largereduction of TBBPA uptake was observed in alkaline conditions and at high temperatures and ionicstrength. The equilibrium between TBBPA and FA@nM was achieved in approximately 40 min withremoval of 98% of the TBBPA. The sorption kinetics were well described by a pseudo-first-order ratemodel, while both Langmuir and Freundlich models described the sorption isotherms well at 298 K.Thermodynamic parameters suggested that the adsorption of TBBPA is exothermic and spontaneous atthe temperatures studied. As fly ash is a low-cost material that is often available on-site, it offers aninteresting alternative to high-cost advanced wastewater treatment systems for removing such organicpollutants."

White male protagonists of each film, now living in the uncertain era of post-Cold War that they believe is plagued by lawlessness and multicultural invasion of the American way of life, struggle to maintain conservative values about national identity, gender, race, and family life formulated in their younger years at the height of the Cold War. In his violent and elegiac journey across various sub/urban localities in and around Los Angeles, Falling Down’s D-Fens changes from a deeply disappointed, angry, and racist cold warrior into a more humane tragic hero who valorizes traditional family values. Similarly, in Gran Torino, Walt Kowalski, a Korean war veteran and diehard Cold War patriarch, becomes more tolerant toward his Asian immigrant neighborhood. This paper argues that these transformations are the result of re-appropriating, not abandoning, some familiar Cold War populist discourses such as consumer patriotism and Cold War orientalism."

This study proposed a class model for developing a space with organic features included, using a paper folding design practice which has recently been introduced for creative design. The purpose of this project is to present the applicability and educational effect of the class model by analyzing the project results. For this project, this researcher considered how to build three dimensional shapes, folding designs and the theory on organic design, and analyzed educational cases where Rowena Reed’s ‘Creating a structure using a flat surface’ was successfully evolved into an exhibition space design. Also, a survey was conducted to examine the response of the students who joined the project. The survey result showed that at the first stage of the basic design practice, the students understood the principles of formation and the features of folding design, going through the process of transforming a flat surface into three-dimensional surfaces. At the second stage, the students acquired skills to clarify the ideas they gained from the research based on specific information, as well as the three dimensional design. At the third stage, they built capability to plan exhibition and promotion spaces which have organic features and express those spaces in a digital way, putting together all the results mentioned in the two previous stages. When it comes to the level of difficulty and satisfaction of each stage, the students responded that the conceptualization using paper folding was relatively easy. The survey showed that the students’ overall satisfaction at each stage and the project results was high. We conclude that the project is educationally effective and useful."

Hybrid Tiled Display System Combining Distributed Rendering and Streaming,2015,"['Distributed rendering', 'image streaming', 'tiled display', 'virtual environments']",,"A tiled display can be defined as a system in which a single large display screen is connected to several clustered computers. Conventionally, two methods have been adopted to generate a large display screen. The first method utilizes image streaming, whereas the second uses distributed rendering of three-dimensional (3D) model data. Because of the 2D nature of the image-streaming method, it cannot be used to establish a 3D virtual environment and rotational transformation in-depth dimension. In comparison, the distributed rendering method functions within a singular virtual world. In this study, a hybrid distributed rendering system (HDRS) is proposed that consolidates the distributed rendering and image streaming methods, thereby overcoming the disadvantages of each. HDRS consists of master and slave servers on an OpenSG scene-graph platform to integrate the distributed-rendering and image-streaming methods. An independent media server is used to transmit synchronized texture data in parallel. For bandwidth efficiency, the media server deploys an adaptive scaled image based on the depth and position information of a plane. As a result, video frames displayed in a 3D environment can undergo geometric transformations such as rotation, scaling, and translation-enabling compatibility with interaction techniques."

Molecular weight and molecularweight distribution were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and degree of polymerization (DP)of PHEMATMS blocks was measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy. These block copolymers were self-assembled asmicelles in water and dissociated into unimers by lowering pH of the solutions, which was demonstrated by dynamiclight scattering (DLS). We also showed that pyrene, a model hydrophobic dye, was loaded efficiently into themicelles and released upon pH-triggered disruption of micelles."

Silymarin (Si) is a herbal product widely used for its hepatoprotective potential. Our study aims to investigate the effects of two different doses of Silymarin on a CCl4-induced model of liver fibrosis with a focus on the early stages of liver injury. Fifty Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10): control group (sunflower oil twice a week); CMC group (carboxymethyl cellulose five times a week, sunflower oil twice a week); CCl4 group (CCl4 in sunflower oil, by gavage, twice a week); CCl4 + Si 50 group (CCl4 twice a week, Silymarin 50 mg/b.w. in CMC five times a week); and CCl4 + Si 200 group (similar to the previous group, with Si 200 mg/b.w.). One month after the experiment began we explored hepato-cytolysis (aminotransferases and lactate dehydrogenase), oxidative stress, fibrosis (histological score, hyaluronic acid), markers of HSC activation (transforming growth factor β1 [TGF-β1], and α-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA] expression by western blot) and activation of Kupffer cells by immunohistochemistry. Our data showed that Si 50 mg/b.w. had the capacity of reducing oxidative stress, hepato-cytolysis, fibrosis, activation of Kupffer cells, and the expression of a-SMA and TGF-β1 with better results than Si 200 mg/b.w. Thus, the usual therapeutic dose of Silymarin, administered in the early stages of fibrotic changes is capable of inhibiting the fibrogenetic mechanism and the progression of initial liver fibrosis."

Condurango bark extract is also known to reduce tumor volume, but the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. Methods: Using a cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) as our model, the molecular events behind condurango extract's (CE's) anticancer effect were investigated by using flow cytometry, immunoblotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Other included cell types were prostate cancer cells (PC3), transformed liver cells (WRL-68), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: Condurango extract (CE) was found to be cytotoxic against target cells, and this was significantly deactivated in the presence of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that its action could be mediated through ROS generation. CE caused an increase in the HeLa cell population containing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage at the G zero/Growth 1 (G0/G1) stage. Further, CE increased the tumor necrosis factor alpha ($TNF-{\alpha}$) and the fas receptor (FasR) levels both at the ribonucleic acid (RNA) and the protein levels, indicating that CE might have a cytotoxic mechanism of action. CE also triggered a sharp decrease in the expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ($NF-{\kappa}B$) both at the RNA and the protein levels, a possible route to attenuation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and caused an opening of the mitochondrial membrane's permeability transition (MPT) pores, thus enhancing caspase activities.

Condurango bark extract is also known to reduce tumor volume, but the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain unclear.Methods: Using a cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) as our model, the molecular events behind condurango extract’s (CE’s) anticancer effect were investigated by using flow cytometry, immunoblotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Other included cell types were prostate cancer cells (PC3), transformed liver cells (WRL-68), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).Results: Condurango extract (CE) was found to be cytotoxic against target cells, and this was significantly deactivated in the presence of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that its action could be mediated through ROS generation. CE caused an increase in the HeLa cell population containing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage at the G zero/Growth 1 (G0/G1) stage. Further, CE increased the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and the fas receptor (FasR) levels both at the ribonucleic acid (RNA) and the protein levels, indicating that CE might have a cytotoxic mechanism of action. CE also triggered a sharp decrease in the expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB ) both at the RNA and the protein levels, a possible route to attenuation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and caused an opening of the mitochondrial membrane’s permeability transition (MPT) pores, thus enhancing caspase activities.Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest possible pathways for CE mediated cytotoxicity in model cancer cells."

His assertion is well attested in the Buddhist narratives. There are many miraculous stories performed by the Buddha and his eminent disciples. Their biographies are enlarged with the quantitative development of those stories. This is well illustrated in the Avadana literature. This paper specifies how Buddhism gained popularity in Indian society where competition between religious groups was extreme. The stories of the Divyavadana reflect the religious situation of that time. Through an analysis of the Purnavadana(PA), 2nd story from the Divyavadana, this paper shows how meditation was used as a miraculous tool to gain the hearts and minds of the Indian audience. In the Avadanas including the Purnavadana, the role of meditation is not vividly present. In the Avadanas, as a tool for miraculous power, meditation is used to transform the audience. Since the intention of this kind of Avadana is to inspire the audience through the religious deeds by the Buddha and his disciples, meditation is mainly used to illustrate their powers. Therefore, the Buddhist monks could establish their competitive status using the power of meditation to gain popularity in Indian society. This power becomes apparent whenever it is needed by the audience. In the Purnavadana, there appear various terms and expressions related to meditation. Here it is not appropriate to discuss their doctrinal or technical aspects since they are used as a skill-in-means to consolidate the authority or miraculous power of the Buddha and his disciples. Being endowed with the power of meditation, they could become the refuge for lay people. Thus, meditation played an important role in establishing the saint image of the Buddhist monks. They were supposed to come and help whenever lay people needed them. This idea was developed into the arhat cult that appealed widely to audiences in East Asia afterwards."

And also Volkswagen is related to a question of break or continuities from Nazis legacy because the plant and automobile model ㅇdesign is established under the nazi government. therefore, Volkswagen’s early history can be related with the question of Nazi modernization continued for a long time. By the fordist effect in the 1920s, west europe carried on a rationalization program through a transformation of Fordism in accordance with each nation’s condition. In case of Germany, however, could never proceed the rationalization in terms of a business including a continued economic crisis after World War Ⅰ. thus Germany could’t get a successful result of industrial rationalization except for a part of company’s trial in the development of compact car. Under a Nazi germany in the 1930s, Volkswagen-Project is regarded as a tool of elimination of discrimination and division among the inside the german society. On the other hand, RDA, German automobile associate, has tried to the project on the point that it had been never considered in terms of a economic condition. In this situation, it is Ferdinand Porsche’s development effort in the car design and a Deutsche Arberitsfront’s take over of the control about Volkswagen from RDA that a developing the car model and establishing the plant could be succeed. Nevertheless, Volkswagen project was failure as a result. ‘a car for the people’ insisted by the Nazi could barely produced under Third Reich, german automobile industry was still interested not in the production of people’s car but in an profit optimization. Porsche, in the same manner, participated in the project for his longtime dream, the production of compact car. therefore, it is possible to find out a real Volkswagen, in terms of a car for the people, was not exist under the Nazism."
A Rapid Life Cycle Assessment Method based on Green Features in Supporting Conceptual Design,2015,"['Rapid life cycle assessment', 'Green features', 'Conceptual design', 'Uncertainty process', 'Intuitionistic fuzzy', 'Monte carlo']",,"A Rapid Life Cycle Assessment (RLCA) method based on Green features is proposed in order to solve the inherent limitations of conventional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), such as long period, massive data requirement, which result in difficulties in supporting product conceptual design. Firstly, Green Feature is proposed in supporting the LCA in conceptual design, where a mapping relationship is established between green feature and design information to achieve the transformation from the design information to green features. Secondly, product conceptual design model is proposed based on modular configuration. The approximate products program will be obtained through retrieval and matching of each module of product using the knowledge base and case base. Thirdly, Intuitionistic Fuzzy theory and Monte Carlo method are respectively used to process the qualitative and quantitative uncertain information of green features in order to ensure the accuracy of the evaluation results. Besides, the appropriate life cycle impact assessment method is selected to complete the life cycle impact assessment and obtain the LCA results. Consequently, the RLCA of product design program is completed to support product green design. Finally, a fan of a ventilation system is studied as an example to verify the proposed RLCA theory."

This article defines as ``The Optimism on Atomic Energy`` such a social phenomenon, and analysis it critically in terms of fetishistic belief. To this end, at first we reviewed Takashi Nagai`s life and thought as a model example of optimism on atomic energy in the second section. Above all, we paid attention to his three identities to be called an atomic scientist, Catholic and subjects of Japanese empire to determine what made his optimistic belief in nuclear power. His case offered us important two clues. Firstly, It goes to show that cause of his optimistic belief in nuclear power not in the nuclear power itself but in his religious and ideological desires for something different. Secondly, the nuclear power exposed as a ``fetish`` that some kinds of desire and fantasy made, which had already before the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, and had been strengthened taking that opportunity. The next thing, in the third section we researched change of ``the public acceptance of nuclear power`` after ``the Fukushima`` in Korean society. Many researches and studies performed after ``the Fukushima`` showed that while the Korean general public indirectly experienced disaster of ``the Fukushima``, they still maintain an optimistic attitude toward nuclear energy. Therefore, we pointed out that the optimism on atomic energy in Korean society after ``the Fukushima`` made fetishistic belief in the economic efficiency of nuclear power, and then suppressed dangerousness of nuclear energy and various social sufferings deeply involved with nuclear power. In the fourth section, we considered that what logical structure fetishistic belief has internally, specifying ``the optimism on atomic energy`` into a discussion on ``the fetishistic belief`` that can be compared to religious belief. Also the optimism on atomic energy can be interpreted in terms of fetishism, because nuclear energy is considered as vital energy and be unquestioningly accepted among the people for the sole reason it has the highest economic efficiency. In addition, we explained what the way that approach to ``the optimism on atomic energy`` in terms of ``fetishistic belief`` means to theological studies or religious studies, focusing on the imagination or the appearance of the kernel in Marx`s theory of commodity fetishism. Finally, in the fifth section we demonstrated that the reason, of which the Korean general public shows fetishistic attitude in dealing with the discourse on economics of nuclear energy, is, optimism of nuclear power closely correspond to their own unconscious desires for development. In conclusion, we reconfirmed that optimism of nuclear power is ``the objective thought forms`` in the developmental capitalism. Thus unless we transform current our own social relations that structuring developmental capitalism, we will never remove optimism of nuclear power that the Korean general public has under any circumstance."
"""Upgrading"" Buddhism? Methods from the Business World in South Korean Buddhism",2015,"['Buddhism', 'modernization', 'social definitions of religion', 'urban religion', 'religious affiliation']",,"Far from being limited to social scientists, the market approach to religions has been widely adopted by religious actors as well, sometimes in a very explicit way. With an ethnographic methodology, this research analyzes how Buddhist organizations in South Korea are implementing business concepts and methods in temples with the aim of increasing their influence in society. It addresses how managerial models and advertising techniques have been appropriated in a religious context and how they interact with redefinitions of Buddhist propagation. This paper argues that the use of communication and management techniques from the business world is not an epiphenomenon. Instead, it echoes a deeper transformation of Buddhism within South Korean society, especially in the role and place of the laity. For the urban temples engaged in ambitious development projects, the use of market related techniques is not merely a way to engage in a market-like competition. It also contributes to redefine their organizational structure as well as their division of religious work, in affinity with a dominant concept of religion."

They used marker and spatial transformation elements effectively, but their efforts to link the elements to the experience of students were not sufficient. In addition, it was very rare to put the contents into simplified drawing or provide extreme cases to enhance the imagery of students. In addition, it is necessary to provide specific case of multi-modal and link the material to the experience of students closely through familiar cases or analogical model to establish an effective visual teaching material. It may also be needed to present simplified drawing for enhancing imagery and provide extreme cases to make students have an opportunity to infer a new situation."

Allegory could be divided into two parts for the purpose of effective study. One is a strategy of criticism and the other is that of narrative which would be covered in chapter2 and chapter3 each. As a result, it was confirmed that an allegorical writing has been a part of writing method based on the modernism as a model of philosophical recognition in the play written by Park Jo-yeol. Firstly, it was discovered that allegory strategies have been used as a mechanism to recognize the world and express the view of value of the writer. In other words, allegory strategies have functioned as a highly effective technology mechanism that can help the writer trying to choose between intense to reveal essential contradiction and external regulations of the violent dictatorial government. Secondly, it was discovered that allegory strategies have been used as a mechanism to appear the distinct characteristics of the genre effectively. World recognitions of the writer have no choice but to accommodate or transform the distinct characteristics of the genre. In addition to that, especially, a drama should consider theatrical attributes to maximize communication with a lot of readers and audiences."
The effect of educational leadership on students’ achievement: a meta-analysis study,2015,[],,"In this meta-analysis study, different leadership styles were combined, and the relationship between educational leadership and student achievement was analyzed. In the literature review, 57 research articles/dissertations, independent from one another, were brought together, and 28,964 study subjects were included in the sample group. The results of the analyses performed with a random effects model revealed that educational leadership has a medium effect on students’ achievement. As was expected, the most comprehensive effect among leadership styles was found in distributive and transformational leadership. Considering the effect of educational leadership on students’ achievement, it is recommended to examine the effect of leadership on other components of school and shareholders in future studies."

The chains can help us uncover publicly unknown knowledge that would develop as empirical studies for investigating the cause of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we applied a novel approach that grafts text mining and the main path analysis into Swanson's ABC model for expanding intermediate concepts to multi-levels and extracting the most significant path. We carried out text mining analysis on the full texts of the pancreatic cancer research papers published during the last ten-year period and extracted the gene-protein entities and relations. The 'brings_about' network was established with bio relations represented by bio verbs. We also applied main path analysis to the network. We found the main direct 'brings_about' path of pancreatic cancer which includes 14 nodes and 13 arcs. 9 arcs were confirmed as the actual relations emerged on the related researches while the other 4 arcs were arisen in the network transformation process for main path analysis. We believe that our approach to combining text mining analysis with main path analysis can be a useful tool for inferring undiscovered knowledge in the situation where either a starting or an ending point is unknown."

Also, this study presented the Father and Son Blumhardt who were the flowers of German Pietism movement, as models of Korean church. Outwardly, 'green growth' of Korea is the plan to make Korea an eco-friendly nation, but this contains the factors, fatal to the environment. The four-river project, a major project of green growth, has brought a fall in the maintenance functions of the four river environments. Besides, it is hard to develop and supply new and renewable energy in Korea. In this situation, the MB government increased the rate of dependence on nuclear energy with an image of clean energy, not new and renewable energy. The problem is that nuclear power plants do not produce clean energy sources. Also, there are yet no definite measures against nuclear waste treatment, even though nuclear waste storage facilities are saturated in Korea. Korea is suffering from aftereffects of the four-river project and the nuclear waste problem would appear by gradation. In this situation, Korean church must have an ecological sensitivity. Johann Christoph Blumhardt sighed not only for physical healing but for social healing and ecological recovery. He even considered ecological rather than merely being satisfied with personal recovery. Also, Korean church needs to act with a prophetic spirituality. Germany went through a revolution that swept the whole Europe, too from 1848 to 1849. In this chaotic period of time, he mentioned constitutional monarchy, arguing that ‘God creates a new border in the society and policy'. Even when there was no word, democracy, Johann Christoph Blumhardt talked about democratic culture. Blumhardt also regarded discipleship as a type of struggle. The Father and Son Blumhardt did not mention the calling of prayer that lacked an act. The kingdom of God is where ""to act with a wait"". This is a socio-transformational act, described by Karl Barth. Church is the third sector and belongs to a territory of civil society. Christians in Korean church should be faithful disciples of Jesus Christ and honest citizens in civil society. If preachers make believers feel a good empathy with this problem of our society and teach them, Korean civil society will come to maturity through churches."
Effect of oscillator and initial condition differences in the dynamics of a ring of dissipative coupled van der Pol oscillators,2015,"['Amplitude death', 'Initial conditions', 'Synchronization', 'Van der Pol oscillators']",,"This paper investigates the dynamical behavior of coupled van der Pol oscillators in a ring to understand vibrations that may occur insystems such as turbine blades mounted on a single shaft. The objective is to investigate the effect of spatial differences in oscillator parametersand initial conditions that occur in realistic systems. The coupling between the neighboring oscillators is modeled as a lineardissipative element, and the mathematical model is analyzed asymptotically and numerically. Synchronization of self excited oscillatorsin mechanical systems has been predominantly investigated in recent literature by focusing on its parameter dependence. This work investigatesthe dependence of dynamics of such systems on initial conditions. The analysis is conducted for identical oscillators as well asoscillators with a frequency mismatch, along with three different sets of initial conditions. The dynamics of the system is discussed basedon time plots, frequency plots, instantaneous dynamics of each oscillator by Hilbert transform and the phase equation obtained by asymptoticexpansion. The study reveals interesting phenomena like amplitude death, oscillation suppression, oscillation resurrection, frequencylocking and beat frequency in the model when subjected to the different set of initial conditions."

The PU membrane wasprepared from a wet phase inversion method and a two-step solution polymerization from polycaprolactone diols(PCL), 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA), etc. The chemical structure,phase state, morphology and surface wettability of the membrane were characterized with Fourier transform infrared(FTIR) spectrometer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contactangle tester, respectively. The temperature and pH responses of the membrane were investigated by means of anamino-acid permeate experiment. The L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) was chosen as model amino-acids. The permeation of theL-Phe was measured using a dead-end flow filtration at varied temperatures and pH, and characterized by the permeateflux (J) and rejection coefficient (R). J of the L-Phe across the PU membrane increased with increasingtemperature and showed a sharp increase when temperature was raised to the crystalline melting temperature (Tm)of the soft segment of PU, while decreased with increasing pH and having a sharp decrease when pH reached thedissociation constant (pKa) of DMPA contained in PU macromolecules. While, the R behavior of L-Phe was justopposite from the results of J, which decreased with increasing temperature and increased with increasing pH,also showing the temperature and pH responses. Hopefully, the PU membrane with temperature- and pH-controllablepermeability has promising prospects in water treatment, membrane separation, drug delivery system, etc."

The industry can produce even more synergic effects by being applied to not only industries like machinery, automobiles, or mecatronics demanding the realism of visual information but also other industries like education, medical care, games, national defense, or sports requiring vividness. As experts are predicting that the country ruling 3D printer technology will be the center of the world in the 21st century, it is urgent for us to study this area thoroughly. Accordingly, in the introduction of this paper, the study purpose, background, method, and range are described. In the body, the cases of applying 3D printing technology to existing industries such as medical care, astronautics, automobiles, architecture, product design, and fashion are examined, and particularly, the cases using 3D printing technology in visual entertainment like animations, movies, or characters are investigated and analyzed. Lastly, in the conclusion, the researcher suggests you to vitalize the application of 3D printing technology more in order to cultivate contents industry, the core industry of creative economy in Korea, and has particularly established an index that enhancing the competitiveness of contents industry applying 3D printing technology through the government and companies’ R&D investment should be the goal of future development in creative economy that is being supported by the government in Korea."
『佛所行讚』과『月印千江之曲』의 붓다관 비교 연구,2015,"['붓다관', '초기교설', '대승불전', '스승', '효', 'Buddha', 'eight events of Buddha’s life story', 'early doctrine', 'Mahayana Buddha’s life story', 'teacher', 'filial piety', 'Buddha of rescue', '八相', '救援佛']","본 논문은 『불소행찬』과 『월인천강지곡』을 비교하여 1~2세기 인도와 15세기 조선의 불전과 붓다관을 연구하고자 했다. 두 불전은 구성과 내용, 붓다관 등 대부분의 측면에 있어 큰 차이를 보이고 있다. 두 불전 모두 팔상을 구성의 기본으로 하고 있으나 『불소행찬』은 정각 이후의 일화에 서술비중을 두고 있다. 하지만 『월인천강지곡』의 경우 붓다의 일생서술에 있어 균형을 이루고 있다. 내용에 있어서는 『불소행찬』은 교설 중심의 사실적인 불전이라 한다면, 『월인천강지곡』은 붓다의 덕목과 구제력 등을 강조한 초역사적인 불전이라고 생각된다.『불소행찬』에서 붓다는 깨달음을 위한 이상적인 모델이자 사람들의 스승이며, 『월인천강지곡』의 경우 붓다는 윤리의 모범이자 중생의 의지처로써 신적 존재이다. 불전의 내용에 있어서 『불소행찬』은 붓다의 현 생애만을 다루고 있으며, 사성제, 팔정도, 무아, 지계, 보시, 업, 인과 등 초기교설을 상세히 다루고 있다. 반면에 『월인천강지곡』은 『법화경』, 『보은경』 등 대승불교의 경전을 중심으로 붓다의 전생담도 풍부히 포함시키고 있다. 이러한 대승경전들은 『월인천강지곡』에서 붓다의 설법의 역할을 하고 있다. 본생담의 주제는 붓다의 자비와 효심을 강조하기 위한 의도가 있는 것으로 생각된다. 『월인천강지곡』에서 붓다는 久遠實成의 本佛이 중생교화를 위해 현현한 垂迹佛이자 化身佛이다. 따라서 生身 붓다를 대신할 불상을 조성하고, 불사리를 신앙을 역설하고 있다. 『월인천강지곡』의 이러한 붓다관은 찬술 당시 조선불교의 억불숭유라는 사회 환경에 대한 반응으로써 의미를 지니며, 이러한 붓다관은 현재 우리나라 신앙불교에 일정부분 영향을 주고 있다고 생각된다.마지막으로 『불소행찬』은 불전 설화가 정형화되기 이전의 붓다 설화의 다양한 단계들, 즉 중간과정들을 포함하고 있다는 특색을, 『월인천강지곡』은 석가족 가계를 중시한 불전이라는 특색을 지니고 있다.","This In this paper Buddha’s life story and Buddha are studied comparing Buddhacarita in India 1~2 C.E. and Wolincheongangjigok in Joseon Dynasty 15 C.E. There appeared a big difference in most aspects of story structure, the contents, and Buddha of the two texts. They are both based on the eight events of Buddha’s life story. Buddhacarita describes Buddha’s story focusing on after His enlightenment while Wolincheongangjigok depicts the eight events in balanced way. Buddhacarita can be said to be a realistic and historical text focusing on the doctrines while Wolincheongangjigok is said to be a mythical one focusing on His virtues and power of His salvation. Buddha in Buddhacarita is an ideal model and teacher for the enlightenment and in Wolincheongangjigok an ethical model and God for sentient beings to depend on.As for the contents Buddhacarita deals with Buddha’s this life and early doctrines in detail such as the Four Noble Truth, the Noble Eightfold Path, No-self, precepts, generosity and karma, etc. But Wolincheongangjigok includes Jataka stories mainly with Mahayana sutras like Lotus Sutra, Boeungyung. These Mahayana sutras play a role of Buddha’s preaching. And the themes of Jataka which Wolincheongangjigok adopts are intended to emphasize the Buddha’s compassion and filial piety.Buddha in Wolincheongangjigok is a transformed body to awaken sentient beings. Therefore He emphasizes to make Buddha images and worship His relics substituting for Buddha. Buddha of Wolincheongangjigok has the meaning of reacting against the circumstances of revering Confucianism and suppressing Buddhism in Joseon Dynasty. The tendency of Wolincheongangjigok has affected today Korean folk Buddhism in some way.Lastly Buddhacarita features various steps of Buddha’s story development before the formalization of Buddha’s story. Wolincheongangjigok is the text of focusing on His family."
그녀의 초상: 화자 재현의 폭력성,2015,"['Edgar Allan Poe', '“The Oval Portrait', '” Jane Eyre', 'Dracula', 'narrator', 'representation', 'language of violation', 'image', 'woman', 'death', 'illness', 'madness', 'nineteenth century']",,"This study aims to analyze the narrators’ language as it is used to depict emotion in the 19th century works, Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Oval Portrait,” Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre, and Bram Stoker’s Dracula. In each of these works, the women portrayed are confronted with death, madness, and disease. Poe’s “The Oval Portrait,” which associates beautiful women with death, transforms the visuality of art into the written word, that of the narrator. This work is about a ‘desperately wounded’ narrator who chances to pass a night in an abandoned chateau where he happens upon an intriguing portrait. His subsequent depiction of the work can be read as a metaphor of translation. The portrait’s painter was so obsessed with his art that he translated the subject of the work, his wife, into a lifeless model while the narrator translates the painting into a text, which is twice removed from the original subject. The artist willingly sacrificed his wife to create a perfect image. Now the narrator sees the painter’s art and violates the traditional principle of translation. In his description, there is a defusion of, or illusion between, life and art, all using vague and quaint language. The narrator is by no means a reliable source of the tale; therefore, the whole story becomes doubly framed, first by the frame of the portrait, and then by the frame of the narrative. Poe never truly wrote about women. Instead, he wrote about a female object and ignored individual character that add depth or believability to the repeated stereotypes of the beautiful damsel. In a similar manner, the other two novels, Jane Eyre, and Dracula, depict women with madness and disease. In Jane Eyre, the character Bertha, who is insane, is described through Rochester. Neither he nor Jane, as narrators, is reliable for representing the whole aspects of Bertha. She is just the catalyst to let Jane establish an ideal home with Rochester. In Stoker’s novel, Dracula is indicated as a man in character. However, in his attack on Lucy, he shows her, a proper lady or angel, as having the ideal feminine behavior in the 19th century. The male narrators, including Doctor Van Helsing, justify Lucy as the woman whose purpose is as victim. Likewise, the original aspects of the women are depicted through death, madness, and disease, but are never shown as real subjects, only reproductions of cultural images via the narrator’s emotions and the objects of fear and agitation."

심훈의 장편소설 『상록수』 연구 ―계몽과 탈선의 의미화: 집짓기 모티브를 중심으로,2015,"['enlightenment novel', 'farmers in the novel', 'V narod movement', 'resistance consciousness', 'a peasant movement', 'Rural Revitalization Campaign(RRC)', '계몽소설', '농촌소설', '브나로드운동', '저항의식', '농민운동', '농촌진흥회', '단발', '색의장려']","심훈의 『상록수』에 대한 지금까지의 논의는 1930년대 브나로드 운동(1931～1934)과 관련된 농촌소설 또는 계몽소설의 개념 틀을 크게 벗어나지 않고 있다. 작품의 실제 모델[최용신, 심재영]에 주목하여 등장인물과의 작품 외적 관련성을 실증적으로 논의한 연구도 앞의 성과를 바탕으로 하고 있다. 또 주인공[채영신, 박동혁]의 낭만적 연애를 주목함으로서 신문 연재소설이 지닌 통속성으로부터 자유롭지 못함도 지적한다. 이러한 논의는 농민소설로서의 가능성과 한계, 교화소설로서의 성과 등으로 수렴되고 있다. 반면 『상록수』에 내포된 저항의식은 작품에서 제시된 낙관적 전망으로 인해 연구자의 관심을 충분히 끌지 못한 점이 있다. 그러나 박동혁의 농민운동이 일제가 주도하는 관제 농촌진흥회운동에 흡수되는 과정을 주목하면 작품 속의 저항 담론은 은폐되어 있지만 저항의지와 방향성은 오히려 강하게 드러난다. 『상록수』에서의 갈등과 파국은 일제의 지방조직과 농촌의 농민조직의 충돌에서 비롯되기 때문이다.『상록수』에서 집[농우회관, 강습소]은 농촌운동의 이념을 고양하고 공동체적 삶을 실천하는 공간이다. 한곡리로 귀향한 박동혁이 농우회관을 짓는 것과 청석골로 귀향한 채영신이 강습소 짓는 것은 이러한 이유에서이다. 집짓기를 통해 이들의 계몽활동의 성과가 구체화되고 집지키기를 통해 압제에 대한 저항의 방향이 제시됨을 볼 수 있다. 박동혁은 농우회원과 함께 지은 회관이 강기천의 모략에 의해 진흥회회관으로 바뀌는 과정에서 감옥살이를 하게 된다. 채영신은 강습소를 짓기 위해 후원금을 모금하다 유치장에 갇히기도 한다. 이는 일제가 수탈체계 유지를 위해 궁벽한 마을까지 감시 및 통제를 확장하는 데서 비롯된다. 『상록수』는 브나로드 운동과 농민운동을 수행하는 인물의 재현뿐만 아니라 일제가 이 운동에 대응 조직을 만들고 농촌사회의 생활습속[단발, 색의장려]까지 통제하는 과정까지 재현하고 있다. 박동혁이 감옥에서 빼앗긴 집[진흥회회관]으로의 귀환은 일제에 의해 농촌진흥회에 흡수된 농민조직을 저항 조직으로의 재결성함을 암시한다.","The discussions about Sangnoksu(Evergreen) by Shim Hun have so far remained within the conceptual framework of rural or enlightenment novels related to the V narod movement(1931～1934) in the 1930s. Even the studies that empirically discussed the novel's external relations with the characters with a focus on the actual models(Choi Yong-shin and Shim Jae-yeong) were based on those achievements. It was also pointed out that the novel focused on the devoted enlightenment efforts and romantic dating of the main characters, Chae Yeong-shin and Park Dong-hyeok, and accordingly was not free from the popular nature of serial story in newspapers. Those discussions have converged into the possibilities and limitations as a farmers' novel and the results as an enlightenment novel. Resistance consciousness inherent in the novel, however, has not attracted enough attention from the researchers due to the optimistic perspective found in the novel. When attention is paid to the process of Park Dong-hyeok's rural movement being transformed into the Rural Revitalization Campaign(RRC) by the ruling Japanese, will for resistance and directionality is revealed rather strongly with the resistance discourse hidden in the work. It is because the conflicts and collapses in the novel are attributed to the clash between the local organization of the ruling Japanese and the farmers' organization of rural areas.In the novel, homes(centers for farmers and schools) are the places to uplift the ideology of rural movement and practice a community life, which is why Park Dong-heok builds a center for farmers after returning to Hangok-ri and Chae Yeong-shin builds a school after returning to Cheongseokgol. The two main characters' commitment and sacrifice is embodied in house building with the direction of resistance against oppression proposed through house keeping. Park is put in prison in the process of his center for farmers built with his farmer friends being changed into an RRC center due to the plot of Kang Gi-cheon. Chae is also put in jail while raising funds to build a school. Those episodes indicate that the ruling Japanese were controlling the rural communities including even the remote villages by forming an RRC, a semi-administrative organization, to maintain their exploitation system. It also has something to do with the death from overwork of Chae that was devoted to house building, trying to overcome the hardship. Before her death, she left a will on house keeping because a house was a base for the resistance movement. Park's return to house(center for farmers) implies broad resistance through the reorganization of farmers' organizations that had been extinct or absorbed into RRC by the ruling Japanese."

The package types of SMD components should be classified to create the job program of the inspection machine. In order to reduce the creation time of job program, we developed the automatic classification algorithm for the SMD packages. We identified the chip-type packages by color and edge distribution of the images. The input images are transformed into the HSI color model, and the binarized histroms are extracted for H and S spaces. Also the edges are extracted from the binarized image, and quantized histograms are obtained for horizontal and vertical direction. The neural network is then applied to classify the package types from the histogram inputs. The experimental results are presented to verify the usefulness of the proposed method."

Roles of Steroid Receptor Coactivator-3 and TTF-1 in Lung Development and Lung Cancer,2015,"['CCSP', 'lung cancer', 'lung development', 'SRC-3', 'TTF-1']","Steroid Receptor Coactivator (SRC)는 스테로이드 수용체 전사 활성화 단백질로, 이중에서 SRC-3는 많은 종류의 종양과 관련하여 연구되었다. 그러나 현재 배아에서의 폐의 분화와 폐암 진행과정에서 SRC-3의 기능적 역할에 대한 연구는 제한적이다. 본 연구는 SRC-3가 생쥐 배아의 폐 분화과정에서 기관지와 폐포의 분화에 중요한 역할을 함을 보여준다. 높은 레벨의 SRC-3 유전자 발현이 클라라 세포와 type II 세포에서 배아발달 말기 시기인 E17.5- E18.5에서 관찰되었으며, 성체 생쥐의 폐에서도 클라라 세포와 type II 세포에서 SRC-3 유전자 발현이 관찰되었다. SRC-3의 폐암에서의 역할을 연구하기 위하여 클라라 세포 특이적 폐암 생쥐 모델을 이용하여 관찰한 결과, SRC-3 잡종 생쥐의 폐와 클라라 세포 특이적 종양 생쥐의 폐에서 TTF-1 유전자와 SRC-3 유전자는 공동 발현되었다. 위 모델에서 TTF-1 유전자 발현은 클라라 세포 유래 종양부위와 다발성 선암 영역에서 선명하게 관찰되었지만, SRC-3 유전자 발현은 다발성 선암 부위에서는 관찰되지 않았다. 이 결과로 SRC-3가 폐암 진행과정 중 침윤성에는 중요한 역할을 수행하지 않음을 확인하였다. SRC-3와 TTF-1의 폐암에서 역할을 클라라 세포 특이적 암 세포주인 mtCC 세포를 사용하여 transient transfection 분석한 결과, TTF-1는 클라라 세포 특이적 단백질인 CCSP 유전자 발현을 현저하게 활성화하였으나, SRC-3는 CCSP 유전자 발현의 활성화에 중요하게 관여하지 않음을 확인하였다. 이 결과는 SRC-3가 폐암 진행에 필수적인 역할을 수행하는 단백질이 아님을 제시한다. 결론적으로, SRC-3는 생쥐 배아와 성체 생쥐에서 기관지와 폐포의 분화에 중요한 역할을 수행하지만, 클라라 세포 유래의 폐암 진행과정에서는 SRC-3는 중요한 역할을 수행하지 않는다.","Steroid receptor coactivators (SRC) are transcriptional coactivators. Among SRCs, SRC-3 is the most studied in relation to different types of tumors. However, the role of SRC-3 in early lung development and lung cancer has not been well studied. The expression profiles of SRC-3 showed that SRC-3 contributed to bronchial and alveolar development in embryonic lung development. SRC-3 was strongly expressed in Clara cells and type II alveolar cells during fetal lung development (E17.5- E18.5), and SRC-3 was expressed in both cell types in the adult lung. TTF-1 was expressed in the lungs of heterozygote SRC-3 mice and Clara cell-specific-CCSP-TAg tumor mice, along with SRC-3 expression. The expression of TTF-1 was localized at transformed Clara cells and multifocal adenocarcinomas in lung cancer mice. However, SRC-3 was not expressed in the multifocal adenocarcinomas, suggesting that SRC-3 might not be involved in the invasiveness of lung cancer. Cotransfection of TTF-1 in Clara cell-specific mtCC cell lines resulted in significant activation of CCSP expression. However, cotransfection of SRC-3 had no significant effects on transient transfection. These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that SRC-3 does not play a significant role in lung tumor progression. In conclusion, SRC-3 is involved in bronchial and alveolar development in fetal and adult lungs, but it does not play an important role in the progression of Clara cell-derived lung cancer."
New Medical Image Fusion Approach with Coding Based on SCD in Wireless Sensor Network,2015,"['Big-data', 'Medical image', 'Spherical coordinate', 'Fusion']",,"The technical development and practical applications of big-data for health is one hot topic under the banner of big-data. Big-data medical image fusion is one of key problems. A new fusion approach with coding based on Spherical Coordinate Domain (SCD) in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for big-data medical image is proposed in this paper. In this approach, the three high-frequency coefficients in wavelet domain of medical image are pre-processed. This pre-processing strategy can reduce the redundant ratio of big-data medical image. Firstly, the high-frequency coefficients are transformed to the spherical coordinate domain to reduce the correlation in the same scale. Then, a multi-scale model product (MSMP) is used to control the shrinkage function so as to make the small wavelet coefficients and some noise removed. The high-frequency parts in spherical coordinate domain are coded by improved SPIHT algorithm. Finally, based on the multi-scale edge of medical image, it can be fused and reconstructed. Experimental results indicate the novel approach is effective and very useful for transmission of big-data medical image(especially, in the wireless environment)."
On-demand Allocation of Multiple Mutual-compensating Resources in Wireless Downlinks: a Multi-server Case,2015,"['Energy efficiency', 'compensable resource', 'allocation', 'user selection', 'cognitive radio']",,"In this paper, we investigate the multi-resource allocation problem, a unique feature of which is that the multiple resources can compensate each other while achieving the desired system performance. In particular, power and time allocations are jointly optimized with the target of energy efficiency under the resource-limited constraints. Different from previous studies on the power-time tradeoff, we consider a multi-server case where the concurrent serving users are quantitatively restricted. Therefore user selection is investigated accompanying the resource allocation, making the power-time tradeoff occur not only between the users in the same server but also in different servers. The complex multivariate optimization problem can be modeled as a variant of 2-Dimension Bin Packing Problem (V2D-BPP), which is a joint non-linear and integer programming problem. Though we use state decomposition model to transform it into a convex optimization problem, the variables are still coupled. Therefore, we propose an Iterative Dual Optimization (IDO) algorithm to obtain its optimal solution.

Due to the limited power and space in operational point of view, the airspeed sensor is not installed, and thus the airspeed need to be estimated using limited sensor measurements. The only IMU measurements(three-axis specific forces and angular rates) are used in this application. The extended Kalman filter algorithm is applied since a linear filter can not cover the its wide operational range in airspeed and altitude. In the implementation of the EKF, the state and measurement equations are transformed into the no-roll frame for simple form of Jacobian matrix. The simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the filter under various environment conditions of sensor noise and wind turbulence. In addition, the effect of the choice in filter design parameters, i.e. process error covariance matrices is analyzed on the performance of the estimation of airspeed and angular rates."

Petruchio’s goal is to tame the shrew, Katherina into a submissive wife. Petruchio deprived Katherina of food and sleep, and then didn’t allow her to wear clothes for her social status as a gentlewoman.Secondly he controlled Katherina’s “scolding tongue” which makes her renown for shrew, “Katherina the curst”. By changing her name from “Katherina the curst” into “plain Kate”. He thought he could transform her identity.Ironically Petruchio’s linguistic maneuver opened the possibility that let Katherina speak in public by imitating Petruchio’s rhetoric. In the final scene of the wedding banquet, Katherina proved herself a loving wife, ideal model wife by imitating ideal wifely submission.Katherina’s long speech displays “the foolishness of the ideal of womanly behavior” enforced by patriarchal ideology. Her intentional parody reveals Petruchio’s failure to tame Katherina into a submissive wife.Katherina played her role as performance. Actually Katherina is a player because Shakespeare lets play-within-a-play. Taming of the shrew is the play within the Induction. Katherina is a player playing Katherina. Like switching a mask, persona, identity is not a fixed or original one, rather performative in the process."

However,seldom currently-available vision-based systems are capable of realizing the synchronous structuraldisplacement measurement for multiple points on the investigated structure. In this paper, the method forvision-based multi-point structural displacement measurement is presented. A series of moving loadingexperiments on a scale arch bridge model are carried out to validate the accuracy and reliability of thevision-based system for multi-point structural displacement measurement. The structural displacements offive points on the bridge deck are measured by the vision-based system and compared with those obtainedby the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The comparative study demonstrates that thevision-based system is deemed to be an effective and reliable means for multi-point structural displacementmeasurement."
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway regulates the development of airway remodeling in patients with asthma,2015,[],,"Airway remodeling is a key characteristic of chronic asthma, particularly in patients with a fixed airflow limitation. The mechanisms underlying airway remodeling are poorly understood, and no therapeutic option is available. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including fibrosis and smooth muscle hypertrophy. In this study, we investigated the roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in airway remodeling in patients with asthma. Wnt7a mRNA expression was prominent in induced sputum from patients with asthma compared with that from healthy controls. Next, we induced a chronic asthma mouse model with airway remodeling features, including subepithelial fibrosis and airway smooth muscle hyperplasia. Higher expression of Wnt family proteins and β-catenin was detected in the lung tissue of mice with chronic asthma compared to control mice. Blocking β-catenin expression with a specific siRNA attenuated airway inflammation and airway remodeling. Decreased subepithelial fibrosis and collagen accumulation in the β-catenin siRNA-treated mice was accompanied by reduced expression of transforming growth factor-β. We further showed that suppressing β-catenin in the chronic asthma model inhibited smooth muscle hyperplasia by downregulating the tenascin C/platelet-derived growth factor receptor pathway. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is highly expressed and regulates the development of airway remodeling in chronic asthma."

THE NON-LINEARITY EFFECT ON THE COLOR-TO-METALLICITY CONVERSION OF GLOBULAR CLUSTERS IN NGC 5128,2015,"['galaxies: individual: NGC 5128', 'galaxies: star clusters: general']",,"The metallicity distribution of globular clusters (GCs) provides a crucial clue for the star formation history of their host galaxy. With the assumption that GCs are generally old, GC colors have been used as a proxy for GC metallicities. Bimodal color distributions of GCs observed in most large galaxies have, for decades, been interpreted as bimodal metallicity distributions, indicating the presence of two populations within a galaxy. However, the conventional view has been challenged by a new theory that non-linear GC color-metallicity relations can cause a bimodal color distribution even from a single-peaked metallicity distribution. Using photometric and spectroscopic data of NGC 5128 GCs in combination with stellar population simulation models, we examine the effect of non-linearity in GC color-metallicity relations on transformation of the color distributions into the metallicity distributions. Although in some colors offsets are present between observations and models for the color-metallicity relations, their overall shape agrees well for various colors. After the offsets are corrected, the observed spectroscopic metallicity distribution is well reproduced via modeled color-metallicity relations from various color distributions having different morphologies. We discuss the implications of our results."

The narrative structures of <Piggybook> and <Zoo> are different in fatherhood representations and endings; however, there is one synthetic meaning structure. This study found out that there are several social mythologies concerned with those narrative structures. Patriarchal fatherhood is found to be premodern and should be modernistically transformed in this era. Especially, it is stressed that the shift in directing point of fatherhood can bring happiness in family structure: from public identity to familism value. Most of all, it is shown that the roles of motherhood should be transformed into epicene roles. In those gender equality can play a critical role in children’s gender role socialization.

On the second order effect of the springing response of large blunt ship,2015,"['Springing', 'Higher order spectral analysis', 'Cross bispectrum', 'Quadratic transfer function', 'Volterra series']",,"The springing response of a large blunt ship was considered to be influenced by a second order interaction between the incoming irregular wave and the blunt geometry of the forebody of the ship. Little efforts have been made to simulate this complicated fluid-structure interaction phenomenon under irregular waves considering the second order effect; hence, the above mentioned premise still remains unproven. In this paper, efforts were made to quantify the second order effect between the wave and vibrating flexible ship structure by analyzing the experimental data obtained through the model basin test of the scaled-segmented model of a large blunt ship. To achieve this goal, the measured vertical bending moment and the wave elevation time history were analyzed using a higher order spectral analysis technique, where the quadratic interaction between the excitation and response was captured by the cross bispectrum of two randomly oscillating variables. The nonlinear response of the vibrating hull was expressed in terms of a quadratic Volterra series assuming that the wave excitation is Gaussian. The Volterra series was then orthogonalized using Barrett’s procedure to remove the interference between the kernels of different orders. Both the linear and quadratic transfer functions of the given system were then derived based on a Fourier transform of the orthogonalized Volterra series. Finally, the response was decomposed into a linear and quadratic part to determine the contribution of the second order effect using the obtained linear and quadratic transfer functions of the system, combined with the given wave spectrum used in the experiment. The contribution of the second order effect on the springing response of the analyzed ship was almost comparable to the linear one in terms of its peak power near the resonance frequency."

Since there are in general many variables that affect the power consumption, for a feasible analysis, we utilize the principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables (or dimensionality) to two or three. We find that the first component is correlated positively to the entrance temperature of various devices such as compressor, expander, evaporator, and the second, negatively to condenser. We then model the power consumption as a multiple regression with two and/or three transformed variables of the selected principal components. We find that fitted value from the multiple regression explains 80~90% of the observed value of the power consumption. This results can be applied to a more elaborate control of the power consumption in the heat pump dryer."

Response surface plots such as contour and 3D plots were generated by the Design Expert software to analyze the effect of independent variables on dependent variables. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies confirmed the absence of interaction between DZ and polymers. Among various models generated by the software, quadratic model was found to be best fit for both the responses. Both the formulation factors influenced BS synergistically.

NGC 7790 contains three  Cep variable stars including CEa Cas, CEb Cas, and CF Cas. PSF photometry was carried out using IRAF/DAOPHOT for all observations. The total number of stars observed both in  and  filter was 1008 and the limiting magnitude was V≈22. To determine atmospheric extinction coefficients and photometric zero points, many blue and red standard stars as well as the standard stars in the celestial equator under various airmass were observed. Photometric data were transformed into the standard Johnson-Cousins’ UBVI standard system.From the analysis of UBVI color-magnitude diagram and color-color diagram, the color excess in  and  filter, the selective extinction ratio in  and  filter and distance modulus of the cluster were determined. The age of the cluster was estimated to be  based on the position of these three Cepheid variables in the color-magnitude diagram, the isochrone of the Geneva group (Ekström et al., 2012-Z=0.019), and the isochrone of the Padova group (Bressan et al., 2012-Z=0.014) were used to compare each other. Of them, the Geneva models that considered stellar rotation well described the position of  Cepheid variables in the blue loop. Although they were well consistent with standard period-luminosity relation of  Cepheid variables, three  Cepheid variables in NGC 7790 were, on average, brighter by about 0.5 mag than the absolute magnitude estimated from the mean period-luminosity relation at a given period.등급도, 세페이드 변광성, 주기-광도 관계"
Stem cell therapy for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders: current status and future perspectives,2015,[],,"Underlying cognitive declines in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are the result of neuron and neuronal process losses due to a wide range of factors. To date, all efforts to develop therapies that target specific AD-related pathways have failed in late-stage human trials. As a result, an emerging consensus in the field is that treatment of AD patients with currently available drug candidates might come too late, likely as a result of significant neuronal loss in the brain. In this regard, cell-replacement therapies, such as human embryonic stem cell- or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cells, hold potential for treating AD patients. With the advent of stem cell technologies and the ability to transform these cells into different types of central nervous system neurons and glial cells, some success in stem cell therapy has been reported in animal models of AD. However, many more steps remain before stem cell therapies will be clinically feasible for AD and related disorders in humans. In this review, we will discuss current research advances in AD pathogenesis and stem cell technologies; additionally, the potential challenges and strategies for using cell-based therapies for AD and related disorders will be discussed."
Perspective : Role of neuropeptide Y in the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell microenvironment,2015,"['Bone marrow microenvironment', 'Hematopoietic stem cell', 'Neuropeptide Y', 'Regeneration', 'Sympathetic nervous system']",,"The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) or neurotransmitters in the bone marrow microenvironment has been known to regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functions such as self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. However, the specific role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in this process remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that NPY deficient mice have significantly reduced HSC numbers and impaired bone marrow regeneration due to apoptotic destruction of SNS fibers and/or endothelial cells. Moreover, NPY treatment prevented bone marrow impairments in a mouse model of chemotherapy- induced SNS injury, while conditional knockout mice lacking the Y1 receptor in macrophages did not restore bone marrow dysfunction in spite of NPY injection. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) secreted by NPY-mediated Y1 receptor stimulation in macrophages plays a key role in neuroprotection and HSC survival in the bone marrow. Therefore, this study reveals a new role of NPY in bone marrow HSC microenvironment, and provides an insight into the therapeutic application of this neuropeptide.

On the second order effect of the springing response of large blunt ship,2015,"['Springing', 'Higher order spectral analysis', 'Cross bispectrum', 'Quadratic transfer function', 'Volterra series']",,"The springing response of a large blunt ship was considered to be influenced by a second order interaction between the incoming irregular wave and the blunt geometry of the forebody of the ship. Little efforts have been made to simulate this complicated fluid-structure interaction phenomenon under irregular waves considering the second order effect; hence, the above mentioned premise still remains unproven. In this paper, efforts were made to quantify the second order effect between the wave and vibrating flexible ship structure by analyzing the experimental data obtained through the model basin test of the scaled-segmented model of a large blunt ship. To achieve this goal, the measured vertical bending moment and the wave elevation time history were analyzed using a higher order spectral analysis technique, where the quadratic interaction between the excitation and response was captured by the cross bispectrum of two randomly oscillating variables. The nonlinear response of the vibrating hull was expressed in terms of a quadratic Volterra series assuming that the wave excitation is Gaussian. The Volterra series was then orthogonalized using Barrett's procedure to remove the interference between the kernels of different orders. Both the linear and quadratic transfer functions of the given system were then derived based on a Fourier transform of the orthogonalized Volterra series. Finally, the response was decomposed into a linear and quadratic part to determine the contribution of the second order effect using the obtained linear and quadratic transfer functions of the system, combined with the given wave spectrum used in the experiment. The contribution of the second order effect on the springing response of the analyzed ship was almost comparable to the linear one in terms of its peak power near the resonance frequency."

This study aims to determine the operating conditions by analyzing the effectiveness of existing domestic forwarding companies, which has not been studied before, and provide suggestions for improving the operational efficiency of forwarding companies in Korea. The average efficiency in terms of CCR for the year 2014 was found to be 0.75, which is a low level that indicates over-commitment and inefficiency. The operating expenses and employee capital generation in operational terms exhibited inefficiencies attributable to scale, which had a value of 0.86.

Moreover, the operational efficiency of all forwarding companies should be improved and expanded to achieve the appropriate scale according to the IRS. In addition, the SBM-DEA model was applied to the top 15 forwarding companies to measure the inefficiency of inputs in 2014, based on capital, overall number of employees, and operating expense, which require reductions of 30%, 36%, and 19%, respectively. Such reductions are apparently capable of improving the current inefficiency. Forwarding companies operating in the employee’s ability to significantly influence operating revenue inefficiency requires effective management of human resources identified areas, and in terms of non-operating expenses were also able to verify the effective accounts receivable management and foreign currency transactions management is required.

The mass diet was shaped by the social structural transformations as well as the changes in the production and consumption of the meat. The agricultural industrialization was promoted by the economic transformation into the corporate capitalism in the early 20th century. In the late 1930s US ‘Green Revolution’ got into its stride and made the crucial influences on the making of ‘the factory farming’, which was droved by the big packers in the system of the meat processing and distribution. These changes in the upstream of the meat production has been linked with the changes in the downstream such as the super-market as the new retailer industry. As a result, the convenience and accessibility to meat were dramatically upgraded. At the same time, the new family form to be harmony with the corporate capitalism was explored in the early 20th century US. The emerging American nuclear family expressed the strong affinity with a domestic livelihood scientifically managed by a mother-housekeeper, looking forward the intimate domesticity. Especially, the home cooking with meat was considered as the expression of the mother-housekeeper’s love to the husband and children. The new family form and the new dietary way of life were spread to the working class during the Second World War and the post-war prosperity. The consumerism as the dominant ideology of the consumer society contributed to the this historical process. The consumerism made ‘the convenient meat’ as the symbol of the American modernity through presenting the purchase of the new technology provided by the corporate food system as a solution to the question, how we could made the modern domesticity. As a rule, in the 1950s, the golden age of the family, consumeristic meat meal based on beef was fully established. But the trend of the meatification of diet tends to create the over-taking meat and related health and ecological problem."

According to the orthodox tale, the Romans derived from Trojan refugees under the leadership of Aeneas. The wandering Trojans headed west and eventually reached the land of Italy after bearing various hardships. The descendants of Aeneas made the founding of Rome effective via Lavinium and Alba Longa. That legend was enshrined in Virgil's Aeneid. In the epic, Greek influence on Roman ancestry was eliminated by providing Italian origins for Dardanus, the common ancestor of Trojans and Latini.The enthusiasm of Augustus for the Trojan legend is well known. One could cite, for example, Augustus’ testified interest in the Aeneid, the Aeneas panel on the Ara Pacis, or his own claim to Trojan descent in the Forum Augustum. Caesar tried to transform Aeneas from a symbol of ethnic identity to the progenitor of the Julii, and Augustus cemented the transformation through state monuments and literary productions of contemporary writers.However, the Trojan legend did not inspire all of the ancients. Dionysius of Halicarnassus in Augustan Rome, for example, believed that the Trojans were Greek. According to Dionysius’ Romaike Archaiologia Rome was a Greek city from its very beginnings. This is what Dionysius is concerned to prove throughout his first book of the Romaike Archaiologia. Every element which went into making up the early population of Rome was of Greek extraction. Italy was peopled with successive bands of Greek immigrants-Aborigines, Pelasgians, Arcadians, the followers of Heracles and the Trojans of Aeneas.The insistence on the Greek origin of Rome is not confined to the existence of a blood relationship between Greeks and Romans. In addition to establishing the shared kinship, Dionysius seeks to prove that many Roman social and political institutions are derived from Greek practices. Rome's Greekness is evident in Dionysius' account of the founding of Rome's constitution in the second book. The pattern of Roman behavior in Romaike Archaiologia goes back to one paradigm : Romulus' constitution.Dionysius' Romulus not only adopted Greek models but also improved them. Dionysius’ definition of Roman identity, as stated above, is at variance with the dominant ideology expounded by Augustan propaganda and Virgil’s Aeneid. This discrepancy is not an indicator of an opposition to Augustus' political program. Although his work may be far removed from simple flattery, it cannot be denied that he was favorably disposed toward Rome. Dionysius’ Romaike Archaiologia provides a strategy to make Roman power acceptable to the Greeks. But while acknowledging the impact of Roman power, any form of dominance needs to be justified in Greek terms in order to be acceptable. Dionysius uses the Greek-Barbarian dichotomy repeatedly and fits the Romans into the dichotomy."
CDSS 실용화를 위한 ArdenML XSLT 개발 -VB.NET을 활용한-,2015,"['Clinical decision support', 'AdenML', 'XSLT']",,"Objectives: The ArdenML is an HL7 standard language for an XML-based representing medical knowledge as logic statements. Problems related to execution of ArdenML are the curly braces problem and the compiler problem, which may be resolved by the introduction of XML-based techniques. This study was aimed at develop an ArdenML based XSLT conforming to HL7 standard. Methods: There were several structural differences in three approaches: Arden Syntax is category; ArdenML is tag; and Visual Basic is comment, function, events, class, and procedure. XSLT was developed by analyzing three approaches. Based on XSLT, ArdenML was translated into Visual Basic and the interface module was developed to allow communicating with legacy systems. Results: Most of the CDSS are independently developed and run, to require reentry of rules. But this system makes it easier to interface with the existing systems simply by translating or compiling rules. Two hundred sixty five of the 285 rules were showed the success after compiling, and 6 errors for the operater query, 14 warnings related to data type were resolved by data re-modeling. Conclusions: ArdenML has been converted into executable files using standard transforms written in the eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) in visual basic language. Development of Arden Syntax compiler requires not only a lot of time and efforts, but also reorganization of existing systems according to the MLM. It also has curly brace problem and problem of requiring additional compiler."

2 Baruch’s Consolation for the Destruction of the Temple,2015,"['제2바룩서', '제4에스라서', '성전', '파괴', '위로', '2 Baruch', '4 Ezra', 'Temple', 'Destruction', 'Consolation']",,"In consideration of the four main Jewish responses toward the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the paper intends to understand the way of 2 Baruch to console its audience who struggles with the destruction (absence) of the Temple. In comparison with the Qurmanite, the post-70 CE Christian, Pharisaic and apocalyptic responses toward the destruction, the study clearly indicates that there are similarities and dissimilarities between 2 Baruch and other Jewish responses in terms of the temple-replacement motif. Even though 2 Baruch proposes the eschatological restoration of the Temple in the future as in other apocalyptic traditions represented by 1 Enoch and 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch does not present any other entity to replace the destroyed Temple, such as the faithful community, messianic interpretation, the study of the Torah and acts of loving-kindness.Instead, in following the same seven-fold literary structure of 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch suggests its own theological intention different from that of 4 Ezra. Baruch functions as a role model who transforms himself from skeptic to consoler in the process of praying, having dialogue with God, receiving visions and meeting the people in the fourth (chaps.21-34), fifth (chaps. 35-47) and sixth part (chaps. 48-77) repeatedly.With the help of the pattern, the author intends his audience to follow Baruch’s gradual change so that they can be changed to go out to console others as Baruch did. In each speech of the three meetings with the people (chaps. 31-34, 44-47, 77), Baruch emphasizes the observance of the Torah (32:1, 44:3, 7, 46:5, 77:15-16). In so doing, the author teaches the audience how to live in the eschatological period without the earthly Temple."

Its widespread use is explained by its simplicity and modest data requirements; it does not require primary data collection and its results are also relatively easy to assess and interpret. Since exports are a vital factor in the overall development of a port, some means of quantitatively assessing export changes must be developed. If shifts in exports can be isolated, they can be used to explain partially structural transformations in ports and to provide insight into possible future direction for port development. This study, therefore, uses a shift-share technique to isolate the various factors associated with export changes. The traditional shift-share model partitions the change of exports in a port into three effects: the national growth effect, the industrial mix effect and the regional share effect. The national growth effect attempts measure the change in exports in a port that would have occurred if its exports had grown at precisely the same rate as the national average. Hence, if a port grows at the same rate as the national average, it does not possess any comparative advantage in terms of resource endowments or human capital. The industrial mix effect associates the differential growth rate in exports between the region in question and the nation as a whole with the overall strengths or weaknesses of the relevant export sectors. Ideally, it is expected that a large proportion of a port’s exports should be concentrated in faster-growing industries. The regional share effect accounts for the differential change between a port and the nation. The regional share effect portrays the competitive position of a port in relation to the rest of the port. For instance, an export component that is growing faster in a port than its counterparts in the nation as a whole will add to the port’s overall growth relative to that of the nation, while a slower-growing component will bring forth an opposite effect. The export data used in this study are obtained from the Korea International Trade Association and consist of exports by two ports of 20 individual products. The particular product categories studied are at three-digit MTI (Ministry of Trade and Industry) level of disaggregation. The national growth effect for synthetic resin and steel plate-rolled products accounted for about 96 percent and 102 percent respectively of the increase in exports of Gwangyang Port or 3,685 and 4,226 million dollars respectively during the period under analysis. The fact that the industrial mix effects of the two products were negative-at 486 and 1,191 million dollars, respectively-can be interpreted to mean that Gwangyang Port’s main export products were growing slowly rather than rapidly. The regional share effects of the two products did not explain a large proportion of the change-at about 16 percent and 27 percent, respectively. The greatest regional share impact was in the steel plate-rolled product sector. The national growth effect of the automobile industry accounted for about 99 percent of the increase in export of Incheon Port or 3,378 million dollars, while that for the flat panel display only explained 1 percent or 100 million dollars. The regional share effect of flat panel display, however, explained a very large percentage of the change-88 percent or 12,238 million dollars-compared with automobiles, at 46 percent or 1,585 million dollars. The industrial mix effect of the two products was negative or explained only a small portion of the change."

Mouvement artistique ne dans le courant de la Reforme du XVIe siecle, le baroque contient par nature deux aspects apparemment contrastes, voire contradictoires. En effet, il est a la fois une esthetique de la Contre-Reforme qui consiste a promouvoir des themes religieux par l’exageration du mouvement, la surcharge decorative, les effets dramatiques, l’exuberance et la grandeur parfois pompeuse ainsi qu``une prise de conscience de la condition humaine qui est d``une impuissance totale, un neant, face a un Dieu omnipresent mais cache, entierement maitre du destin des hommes. Or, il n``est pas difficile de relever dans le cas de Racine ce double caractere du baroque. D``une part, Racine, en tant qu``historiographe et courtisan du roi, consacre son genie litteraire a construire le Siecle de Louis le Grand et a l``immortaliser pour l``eternite. Ceci tient a l``aspect du courant baroque de la Contre-Reforme qui se transforme au XVIIe siecle en France en un outil pour la promotion de la monarchie absolue. D``autre part, Racine ne manque pas de representer avec excellence la sensibilite tragique de l``homme baroque a travers ses personnages, plus particulierement celui de Phedre. Cette heroine tragique, tout en vivant pleinement le conflit entre passion et raison sans fin, nous fournit un modele de l``homme baroque qui assume avec courage la condition tragique humaine dans le monde d``ici-bas. Une fois repere les deux aspects du mouvement baroque meme chez Racine qui incarne par excellence le classicisme francais, on peut dire que le baroque et le classicisme coexistent dans l``etat baroque qu``est la France sous le regne de Louis XIV.

Generally, his first transformation is considered much more valuable than the second, because what the hero contradicts clearly his former thoughts gives the impression that the end of the work is trivial and unworthy. But Renè Girard, a Christian critic, interprets the two changes respectively as an imitation of the mediator of desire, and as a reconciliation between the man and the sacred. It is possible to be reconciled by giving up human desire and pride. It is worth stressing the importance of reconciliation in Christianism. Meanwhile, some heroes of Mario Benedetti’s works don’t have to change a lot, because they are mature and real beings, and convinced that revolution is possible. Therefore they don’t have a significant transformation, neither change of their mind, nor religious conversion. They are militant models of humanism which is based on pride of human beings. It is true that there is a great difference between Christianism and Humanism, but the two are not always incompatible. Frequently they influence each other and share some qualities. Don Quixote and the heroes of Benedetti coincide specifically in two points: both suffer defeats in the surrounding reality, but they don""t stop being good.

Spenser’s Ovidian digressions have long been treated as classicizing ornaments or decorative deviations from the main narrative of The Faerie Queene. However, Spenser uses these engagements with Ovidian digression to illuminate the means toward the allegorized virtues that the titular knights in each book of The Faerie Queene are struggling to achieve. In the Renaissance, when Spenser was writing, Ovid’s Metamorphoses was regarded as a romance, particularly with regard to its proliferating plots and characters and its narrative use of entrelacement and digressions. Contemporary readers recognized this multiplicity and variety as the source of poetic pleasure, and contemporary writers looked to Ovid as a poetic model to emulate. Drawing on Renaissance imitation theory, Spenser incorporates Ovid’s Metamorphoses into his own epic-romance, The Faerie Queene, simultaneously borrowing and transforming Ovidian digressions, both replicating Ovid’s art and rewriting it in moral terms. For example, Spenser actively expands the Ovidian trope of the labyrinth and complicating its aesthetic and moral implications through the Wandering Wood, itself a form of Ovidian digression. It is important, I argue, to recognize the Wandering Wood as a complex rhetorical space Spenser constructs with varying Ovidian allusions. In this space, Redcrosse faces a trial through which his reading ability is put to the test. The wisdom and spiritual maturity of Redcross Knight must be earned on the digressive way through error."

Leibniz’s philosophical ideas and the sociological tendency of Koryo Dynasty are historically not in any relationship with each other and each is comprised of its own heterogeneous areas. However, they share some meaningful structural similarity in respect that they both distinguishingly center on the harmony between pluralism and unity. It is noticeable for Koryo Dynasty to sustain a long period of stable prosperity just as pluralism and unity in it was in harmony and balanced, whereas it was insecurely disintegrated when the gap between them was critically increasing. In this perspective, this paper intends to explore the way of acquiring the stability of a society by taking a close look at the history through the very philosophical thought, which is considered as the most systematic theory for the harmony of pluralism and unity. Pluralism has a twofold potential with regard to social management. On the one hand, the spread of pluralism, if it is accompanied by solid integration, constitutes a key mechanism to contribute to the stability and development of a society. What makes it possible is in the way that central and local forces hold the relative autonomy through an adequate tension between them. On the other hand, in case of collapsing the harmony between pluralism and unity, thereby, the society inevitably experiences the transformation of its structure, and, further, the remaining society breaks down or is replaced by other types of society. Koryo Dynasty originally started as a pluralistic social structure, though, its rise and fall seems to have been determined by whether it successfully maintained the balance between pluralism and unity or not. If so, we are able to reach a possible and crucial lesson in the consideration of Koryo dynasty with the framework of Leibniz’s harmony theory, namely, that we can secure a stable society when timely settling the societal structural system which can provide the balance of pluralism and unity. In this regard, this paper focuses largely on three parts as follows. First, in philosophical and sociological perspective, it makes a general overview of pluralism. Second, it specifically determines the Leibniz’s concept of pluralism in his philosophical thought. Finally, it derives some meaningful ways when it comes to social management by comparatively considering both the Leibniz’s harmony model of pluralism and unity and Koryo Dynasty’s pluralism."

However, we still have superficial understanding of the principle of action research as well as insufficient technical know-how about action research. Grieving over such problems, this paper tries to clarify the methodological essence of action research and to examine its relevant research techniques from a critical perspective. The result is reported along with seven items including the diagnosis of ‘state of the art,’ the analysis of problems, and suggestions for further studies. First, we easily find papers in which action research is either confused with field research or regarded as a branch of field research. Second, action research should be distinguished from field research for its methodological specialties even though the two shares some of the same problems and orientations. Third, the methodological specialties include: ① research on the practical site ② the actual betterment of the life world ③ the formation of subjectivity and transformation of research participants ④ production of grounded theories, among others. Fourth, especially in qualitative action research, we should attend to: ① keep the emancipatory paradigm ② value the wisdom of uncertainty ③ promote the evolution of collaboration. Fifth, we are asked to take note of new-brand action researches including: ① collaborative action research ② practitioner action research ③ critical action research. Sixth, we need to develop the connotation and denotation of action research along with various ‘action theories.’ Seventh, we offer suggestions for further studies such as: ① getting out of the old ‘before-after’ effect verification research models ② performing integrative and cross-modal research practices on three ‘Es’ (Experiencing, Enquiring, and Examining) ③ developing diverse analytic tools and creative interpretation frames ④ nourishing descriptive researches based on understanding rather than explanation ⑤ furthering ontological ‘moonzilbinbin (文質彬彬)’ approaches."

1637년 椵島전투를 둘러싼 기억의 전승에 관한 연구,2015,[],"본 연구는 1637년 조․청 연합군이 수행한 椵島전투을 둘러싼 기억이 후대에 어떻게 전승되었는지를 추적한 결과물이다. 이를 통해 사실과는 다르게 전승되었던 가도전투 기억이 어떠한 계기로 변조되었는지, 또 그것은 어떠한 역사적 의미를 지니는지를 朝鮮中華主義라는 이념적 틀을 통해 규명해 보았다.1637년 2월 조선을 굴복시킨 淸은 여세를 몰아 明의 군사기지가 자리하던 가도를 공략했다. 물론 조선에게도 싸움에 동참할 것을 요구했으며 항복 직후의 조선은 이 같은 요구를 거부할 여력이 없었다. 결국 조선은 5,000여명의 병력을 파견했고, 문제적 사건 ‘가도전투’는 이렇게 시작되었다. 잘 알려진 것처럼 이 무렵 조선의 지배엘리트인 지식인들은 명을 上國이자 君父의 나라로 여기고 있었다. 때문에 이 공격을 망극하며 의리상 차마 할 수 없는 행동으로 생각하는 한편 내심 공격이 실패로 돌아갈 것을 바라고 있었다.문제는 조선군이 이러한 바람을 저버리고 전투에서 큰 공을 세웠다는 데서 시작되었다. 전투 참여 자체를 부끄럽게 여겼던 지식인들에게 조선군의 활약은 도무지 믿고 싶지도 기억하고 싶지도 않은 일이었다. 가도전투는 丁丑下城과 함께 호란의 패배로 조선인들이 감내해야 했던 정신적 상처 가운데 하나였던 셈이다. 그런데 시간이 흐름에 따라 지식인들은 부끄러운 기억을 과감하게 변조하려 시도했다. 그리고 그것은 대명의리론이 고양되고 조선중화주의가 성립하는 시대적 흐름과 밀접한 관련을 맺고 있었다.조선중화주의의 이데올로그이자 임경업을 대명의리의 화신으로 추켜세웠던 宋時烈은 가도전투 기억 변조의 시작점에 서서 크나큰 영향력을 행사했던 인물 가운데 하나였다. 실제로 그의 학문적․정치적 위상을 고려할 때, 17세기 말에 지어진 『林將軍慶業傳』은 기억 변조의 가이드라인을 제시한 텍스트와도 같았다. 이렇게 변조가 시작된 가도전투 기억은 다른 지식인들의 기록물에 수록되며 창의적인 확대 재생산의 길을 걸었다. 비틀린 기억 속에는 조선군의 활약이 삭제되었고 조선군이 명군을 피신시키거나 청군을 공격했다는 만들어진 일화가 삽입되었다. 그리고 이 같은 작업은 18세기까지 꾸준히 지속되었다.오랜 기간 변조된 기억은 이제 국왕의 어록이나 국가 기록물에 반영되기에 이르렀다. 자연스럽게 전투에 참가한 인물들은 추숭되었으며, 사건은 명을 향한 충정이 드러난 자랑스러운 일로 기억되었다. 변조된 가도전투 기억이 마침내 국가적으로 인정받았던 셈이다. 더 이상 가도전투는 부끄럽거나 참담한 기억이 아니었다. 대명의리를 지켰던 자랑스러운 기억이었다.이렇게 기억이 변조됐다는 사실은 자신들이 추구하는 이념적 지향에 걸맞은 사례와, 본받을 만한 롤 모델을 조선 지식인들이 훌륭하게 만들어냈다는 것을 의미하기도 했다. 그들은 이러한 작업을 통해 문명국 조선의 자존심을 세우는 동시에, 주체적 문화강국으로서 국가발전을 이룩할 수도 있었지만, 한편으로 피지배계급인 민에게 충절을 지킨 표상을 제시하여─충절의 대상인─체제에 순응하라는 묵시적인 동의도 함께 얻어낼 수 있었다. 가도전투를 둘러싼 기억의 변조는 당대 지식인들의 치열한 고민이 담긴 17∼18세기적 처방이었던 것이다.요컨대 1637년 가도전투를 둘러싼 기억은 17∼18세기 조선 지식인들의 이념적 지향에 걸맞게 변조되어 전승되었다고 할 수 있  ...","This study is a result of tracking the transmission process of related memory over the battle of Ga(椵)-island in 1637.In 1637, Choson surrendered to Qing as a result of the invasion of Manchu(丙子胡亂, in 1636～1637). Qing also called for the surrender of the Choson government, and planned to invade Ga-island, which served as a strategic base for Ming. Surrounded by Qing, Choson reluctantly decided to send the troops over. Surprisingly, the Choson army made a glorious success of the battle.At that time, the intellectuals of Choson internalized the Neo-Confucianism(性理學). And as a result, Choson had an obligation to remain loyal to Ming as it was the country of their fathers and was a suzerain state. Such idea created the notion that Choson had inherited Sino-centrism(中華), “Sino-centrismlate Choson (朝鮮中華主義, Choson-Junghwa Ideology)”.The battle of Ga-island by Choson was viewed as shameful in late Choson Sino-centrism perspective. Historically, the shameful memory had been often falsified(變造). The memories of the battle of Ga(椵)-island was not an exception. The ruling elite of Choson later falsified the historical accounts of the battle during the 17th and 18th centuries by claiming that Choson was loyal to Ming. In doing so, these falsified accounts transformed the history into a proud memory. Gradually these falsified accounts were eventually recognized as official by king’s words and national archives.As a result, the people involved with the battle were also re-evaluated. Im Gyeong- eop(林慶業) and the general Riw-rim(柳琳) of Choson army, became role models by staying loyal to Ming and as a result of the inaccuracies this particular history turned out to be positive for Choson.Falsification of these historical accounts eventually served as an example of the ideology and the role model in which the intellectuals pursued for. The intellectuals were able to use the falsification of the historical accounts to increase the self-esteem of Choson and restore the social order. The falsification of Ga-island battle memory was a prescription which was filled with agonies of the intellectuals during the 17th and 18th centuries.In short, the memories of the Ga(椵)-island battle was handed down all the while being falsified in accordance with the perspectives of the Choson intellectuals."

But audit methodology dealing with audit risks involved with policy and program audit has not been developed to the extent of practical use of audit institutions.This study intended to identify audit risks of policy & program audit, and audit methods to mange the risks, through the behavioral event interview of excellent auditors from BAI(The Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea). Based on the interview findings, public auditors are facing with various audit risk factors in the audit process dealing with major policies and programs, which receive national attention.Audit risk model of policy & program audit can be simply expressed as follows: AR(Audit Risk) = PR(Policy & Program Risk) × MR(Management Risk of Audit Team). While gathering and analysing the interview information, it was found that policy & program audit could be vulnerable to the general risk factors in relation to the subject and the object of the audit, as much as the management risk factors of audit practice.Even though BAI should transform audit approach from substantive approach to risk-based and in-depth evaluation in order to raise the value of public auditing, the mistaken selection of audit matters and feasibility problem of audit findings can hinder the progress to performance audit. Above all thing, top management should establish the strategy for enhancing the competencies of auditors to manage efficiently audit risks of policy & program audit."

The public sphere as a theoretical framework played an important role here. The public sphere and the public service broadcasting have shown a relationship of coevolution in theory and practice respectively. The aim of this paper is to review the past coevolutionary process between the public sphere and the public service broadcasting on the one hand and to sketch a future model of the public service broadcasting on the other. Since the publication of the English translation of Habermas’s “The structural transformation of the public sphere” in 1989, we have worked through adaptations and modifications in his theory of the public sphere in response to criticisms and counter-criticisms to his original ideas. As a metaphor of the critical importance of communication in contemporary societies, the con-cept of the public sphere became a guiding principle in the field of the public service broadcasting. It is well reflected in the effort of radical impartiality to incorporate diverse values as a way to overcome seesaw-like opposition, the financial basis of license fee to maintain the frame of accountability, and the active utilization of popular entertainment programs to help individuals find affective, peripheral identities. The commons can be the final goal of the public service broadcasting in today’s digitally networked communication."

N. Iljine developed for his patients ‘therapeutic’ theatre which is structured in five parts: 1. the part of topic finding 2. analysis, reflection on the topic 3. transposition, construction of the framework 4. realising the scenario 5. reflection on the play. Iljine describes ‘therapeutic theatre’ as trying to combine sciences such as biology and medicine with the humanities, music and theatre.Moreno established ‘pure Spontaneity Theatre’ in Vienna. Actually he intended the radical release from being forced to act a role. Spontaneity and creativity are the propelling forces in human progress.Brecht characterized his Lehrstück 『Die Maßnahme』 as his intended model for future theatre. Brecht considered it as the only way to get access to ‘Maßnahme‘ to participate actively in the play. Firstly it is about ‘taking notice‘, secondly it is to experience playing a role and finaly it is about ‘practising’ a new role. Brechtians Lehrstücke should be seen in a new light."

Whereas existing literature has examined a wide range of issues such as user characteristics, environmental impact, helmet matters and models of provision, a relatively neglected area of academic concern is the political aspect of a BSS including the political decision-making structure and political institutions influencing the effectiveness of the BSS. This paper attempts to fill this void by providing a comparative case study of the BSS in four Korean cities. It finds that mayoral willingness and commitment to the promotion of a BSS as an environmental policy and the number of their consecutive terms in office explain the variation among them in terms of the stability and effectiveness of BSS in Korea. For the further development of BSS, strengthening civil society and the role of the city council is necessary to transform the current top-down governance structure of BSS into a more bottom-up style of governance."

First of all, after the overview of the current society in the light of the insecurity thesis in which a trivial conflict can be transformed into a more serious conflict, we proposed a theoretical framework and practical plans in the review of the characteristics, causes, and the process of the class conflict. Based on data from 1,200 adults aged 19 years and over, this study empirically analyzed major propositions that were derived from the theoretical discussion and examined the implications. Today’s Korea society that can be characterized as a tense standoff among segregated classes needs an explanation of expansion that exceeds beyond the current theories of explanations, based on the recognition and distribution. Therefore, we framed a new social integration model focusing on a legalistic approach based on retributive justice, a welfare approach based on distributive justice, and a reconciliatory approach based on restorative justice. Study findings indicated the desire for a welfare approach was divided into two other approaches. And, the results of this study confirm that a liability approach which is based on the logic of legal or supra-legal and a reconciliatory approach which is based on the emotional sympathy are the powerful alternatives that can resolve the rising conflicts in the state of high insecurity."

First of all, we should note that abstract painting in its nascent stage made the transition from the figurative reproduction of visual reality to the abstraction of its fundamental mode of existence. In this respect Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944), Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) and Kazimir Malevich (1879-1935) did not break, at least not entirely, with the practice of ""imitative representation"" (mimesis in ancient Greek). They sought to transcend immediate exteriority and to transpose, on the level of pictorial realization, the deployment itself of the visible. An alternative, if not complementary, conception of the abstractive process currently underpins the approaches to painting of Peter Halley (born 1953) and Ross Bleckner (born 1949). These approaches stand out through their use of abstract geometric patterns in representational terms. This characteristic makes them comparable to the practice of ""cultural imitation"" (mimesis in ancient Greek). Nevertheless, it has to be enphasized that all those variants of geometric abstraction are related, in a way that is specific to each of them, with mimesis as imitative representation as well as cultural imitation. The painting practices discussed here raise the question of the relationship of geometric abstraction to current conditions and modes of existence. This invites to consider the antinomy, outlined by the underlying theories, between the utopia of a concrete modification of space and behavior, and the dystopia of a dominant cultural ideology infiltrating aesthetics. As regards early geometric abstraction, the notion of utopia has been adapted to a process generated by meta-mimesis, that is, by the mimesis of the auto-poiesis (from autos, ""oneself"", and poiesis, ""production"", in ancient Greek) of inner and outer reality. Here, the prefix ""meta"" means that which exceeds and encompasses the mimetic means as well as mimesis itself. In another vein, it shows a shift from the mimesis of reality as an empirically determinable object to the mimesis of reality as a transcendent mode of self-production. Such a position is somewhat reversed by neo-geometric abstraction, which on the contrary has a dystopian character. Neo-geometric abstraction can also be considered as a meta-mimesis, but in its case the auto-poietic process functioning as a model is that of the dominant spatial organization and culture in the West. These details make it possible to recognize within abstract art practicesa significant shift in the interpretation of the geometric sign understood in a double sense, as a plastic medium and as a means for transforming existence. Thus, the issue of the autonomy or heteronomy of the abstract geometric form proves to be a pseudo-issue. In  fact, according to the situation, the meta-mimetic approach emerges asan integral part of the utopian or dystopian conception of the abstactive process. Therein lies the interest of exploring the aesthetic and theoretical implications of the transition from the early geometric abstraction to the neo-geometric abstraction."
로망스의 정치성: 「기사 이야기」를 중심으로,2015,"['제프리 초서', '캔터베리 이야기', '기사 이야기', '로망스의 정치성', 'Geoffrey Chaucer', 'Canterbury Tales', 'Knight’s Tale', 'Political Nature of Romance']",,"This study aims to grasp the meaning of political nature of the medievalromance. The romance has a paradigm that the knight rides out to seek anadventure. Northrop Frye says that romance has superior characters and anarchetype that support the contemporary social structure. Often, romanceprovides its reader or audience with the nostalgia for the past to provoke ameaningful challenge to the present. Frederic Jameson has an interest on whatfor Frye is a deformation or deviation from the archetype of romance. He thinksthat romance has a historical and ideological context, and reflects a particularideological context. Geraldine Heng recognizes romance as “the name ofdesiring narrational modality that coalesces from the extant cultural matrix.”She stresses on an expansive meaning of romance as “the material concretionof the collective will of cultural agents and forces.”From these perspectives, I try to focus on Knight Tale and examine thepolitical context of Geoffrey Chaucer, the author of the Tale. He was a son ofrich merchant and served as an bureaucrat, courtier and diplomat. He wentthrough a period of turbulence in England in 14th century. Treacherousbehavior was punished severly. Writing and even talking against the royalfamily were punished. In this context, Chaucer was very cautious to reveal hisown political message. Therefore, to lessen the burden and avoid a politicalcontroversy, he appropriated and transformed the convention of romance.The adventure that romance knight seeks to carry out and achieveself-examination is not given to Palamon and Arcite. The idealized love ofromance between knight and his lady has no interactive relationship. Instead,Theseus, who reminds Edward Ⅲ according to Derek Brewer, is represented asmerciful and powerful king. He shows mercy to begging ladies and defeats OldCreon. However, he imprison Palamon and Arcite, and never intends to setthem free. After Palamon and Arcite come out of prison and fight in the forest,he makes a suggestion of tournament for winner to get Emilye, but hissuggestion causes a great misfortune, Arcite’s death. Theseus turns the criticismtoward the Providence of God and arranges the marriage between Palamon andEmilye. He first considers the allegiance with other countries and security of hiskingdom, and orders them to marry. Regardless of their intentions, Palamonand Emilye get married. The narrator says that they lived in bliss, in richnessand in health. However, this happy ending is an only conventional romanceending. By using and transforming convention of the mode, Chaucer makesPalamon, Arcite, and Emilye victims of romance. Rather, he stresses on Theseusand provides a model of king. Chaucer confidential sends his political messagethat king should use his political ability to tide over a difficult situation andvalue the opinion of Parliament."

Since all educational activities are a process of means of which the attainment of various specific aims are sought, educational teleologism has always been a subject of utmost interest in education. In fact, lots of educators are content with the short-term goals of conducting daily classes without making overall study of long-term educational goals. Such attitudes of educators remind us of a wind-blown skiff at sea without destination or compass. Three categories of educational teleologisms are logically inferred from the emphasis points between process and result of education, and manipulatively defined as 1) intrinsic teleologism of education, 2) instrumental teleologism of education, and 3) integrated teleologism of education. The success-oriented teleoligism of education is called as the model of instrumented teleologism of education. During the past seventy years in Korea, the success-oriented teleologism of education has managed our education overwhelmingly. Therefore, its dysfunctions have been accumulated and have caused various destructive and fatal infections in Korean education. In conclusion, I suggest as follows: First of all, we should drastically transform the success-oriented teleologism of education into the happiness-oriented teleologism of education. Secondly, we should incessantly do our best efforts to remodel our educational environment in which all educators and students can always be happy. After all, it is hoped that this study will be contributed as a stepping stone of some help to those educators and students in Korea who are interested in ‘happiness and happiness-education.’"
14세기 전반기 프랑스 왕권의 종교 텍스트 번역 - 필리프 6세 시기를 중심으로 -,2015,"['필리프 6세', '번역', '성서', '종교 텍스트', '문화자본', '정치적 의사소통', 'Philip VI of Valois', 'Translation', 'Religious Text', 'Bible', 'Cultural Capital', 'Political Communication']","14세기 전반기 프랑스 필리프 6세(Philippe VI, 1328-1350) 정부의 종교 텍스트 번역사업은 14세기를 전후로 이루어진 세속어 문자문화 및 문해력의 확산과 세속대중들 사이에서의 신앙심 심화와 저변확대라는 종교-문화적 현상의 큰 흐름과 그 궤를 같이 한다. 하지만 필리프 6세의 번역사업은 이러한 흐름을 단순히 뒤쫓아 가는 것이 아니라 막대한 재정을 바탕으로 이러한 흐름에 선도적인 역할을 하려는 왕권의 전략을 드러낸다. 장 드 비녜나 피에르 드 앙제스트에 의해 이루어진 5편의 종교텍스트 번역들은 한편으로는 독서문화와 신앙심의 확산이라는 당대 현상의 반영이면서 동시에 이러한 현상에 대한 왕권의 대응전략이기도 했다. 특히 후자의 차원에서 그것은 라틴어라는 권위의 언어를 잠시 뒤로 밀어두고 취약한 왕권에 정치사회 구성원들의 관심을 끌어 모으고 가장 기독교적인 왕으로서의 정당성을 확보하기 위한 정치문화적 전략의 의미를 지닌다. 또 거꾸로 왕권이 번역한 텍스트들은 프랑스왕권이라는 상징성 덕택에 다른 어떤 번역들보다도 대중적으로 성공할 수 있는 이점들을 부여받게 된다. 또한 필리프 6세의 번역사업은 14-15세기에 내내 이루어질 프랑스 왕권의 프랑스어 번역사업 후원운동의 시작을 알리는 본격적인 신호탄이라는 의미를 지닌다.이러한 번역사업의 일반적인 특성과 더불어 종교 텍스트들에 대한 번역작업은 다른 종류의 텍스트들에 대한 번역작업들과는 다른 내용상의 변형을 수반하게 된다. 즉 교회의 언어인 라틴어에서 세속인들의 언어이자 이제 막 적극적으로 왕권에 의해 사용되는 프랑스어로 언어매체가 변형되는 과정은 텍스트의 내용을 훼손하거나 직접 변형시키지는 않지만 텍스트 외적인 차원에서의 의미작용을 정치적인 방향으로 이끌어 나간다. 이러한 차원에서 왕권의 준종교적인 사명감은 국가체제가 등장하기 시작한 14세기 초에 왕국 전체에 대한 ‘통치’의 문제를 제기한다. 그것은 루이 9세에게서 보이는 바와 같은 성 프란체스코라는 종교적·상징적 모범을 만드는 것에 그치는 것이 아니라 세속적인 차원에서의 실질적인 국정운영과 인민들을 향한 배려에 대한 관심을 도출한다.물론 필리프 6세의 번역사업은 양적인 측면에서 그리 대중적인 성공을 거뒀다고 볼 수는 없을 것이다. 그러나 번역 텍스트들의 종류를 다각화시키고 있다는 점에서 중요한 시사점을 주고 있다. 종교 텍스트 번역에 대한 관심이 가장 일반적이었던 『성서』에만 국한되지 않고 성자전과 전례집, 복음서 강론집, 신비주의적 명상론에 까지 이르고 있다는 점은 왕권이 교회를 중심으로 이루어져 오던 다양한 종교적 활동들을 전유하여 자신의 다양한 상징자본을 확보하려는 시도로 해석될 수 있다. 그것은 종교장(champ religieux)에서 정치장(champ politique)이 분할되어 나오면서도 정치적인 것(le politique)이 종교에 의존할 수밖에 없는 중세 말 상황의 복잡다단한 일면을 보여준다.","The translation of religious texts executed by the government of Philippe VI(1328-1350) in the First half of 14th Century France corresponds with proliferation of vernacular literacy around the 14th Century France and with religious and cultural phenomena as intensification and expansion of private devotion. But the translation of Philip VI wasn't a simple following this trend but an expression of royal strategy for it's pioneer. The five texts translated by Jean de Vigny and Pierre de Hangest, quasi-official royal translators, was not only a reflection of contemporary lecture culture and diffusion of devotion, but also a royal reaction on these socio-cultural phenomena. Especially it also means politico cultural strategy in order to legitimate the Valois kingship as 'rex christianissimus' and to appeal to various members of political society in renouncing the Latin, authoritative language. In the other way, the translation of French kingship merit more popular success than any other texts due to the French royal symbolism. And the translation of Philip VI means the starting point for the translation patronization in the 14th and 15th Centuries.The vernacular translation of religious texts invovles a mutation of content, different with the translation of other kinds of texts. A language transformation from the Latin, ecclesiastical language, to the French, vernacular language and actively used by Valois kingship doesn't modify the contents, but it emanates  various political effects. In this point, the royal sense of religious duty propose the problem of 'governmentality' in the early 14th Century around the birth of State system. It isn't only making religious and symbolic model as saint Louis IX, but relates with state administration and consideration on people of the whole kingdom in the level of secular political community.Of course, the translation of Philip VI was not so successful in popular proliferation in the quantitative perspective. However, it suggests important meaning on the diversification of kinds of translation texts. That his translation embraces the Bible as well as Hagiography, Homely and Meditation Books presents the royal intention to ensure his divers symbolic cultures appropriating ecclesiastical activities of the Church. It show a complex scene of late Middle Ages characterized by ramification of the political field from the religious field and by dependance of le politique on the religion."

Because of market globalization and the advancement of e-commerce the importance of supply chain network is increasing. A supply chain can produce products for multiple markets. Also, an individual company is likely to have only limited visibility of the supply chain structure, which makes it difficult to make future demand estimations, because the pattern of demand propagation through the supply chain depends on the capabilities and strategies of companies along the path from the markets to the company. There will be the conflict among the pursuit of the profit of all members of the SCM. In order to maximize the total profit of the SCM, negotiation among all members is necessary. In this research, we consider only purchasing agent and supplier agent. We consider multi-agent based automated negotiation system to find the best negotiation strategy that makes all members of the SCM satisfied in a simple SCM. And we propose the trade-off algorithm to provide the total maximum profits and the minimum difference in profits of both attendances in negotiations. Multi-agent based automated negotiation system could be transformed into linear programming with negotiation information. The ideas behind the suggested model are trade-off algorithm with an agent and we consider multiple factors that are color, price, mileage, and delivery date. We``ve compared multi-agent based automated negotiation system with negotiation system with trade-off mechanism. We have used utility function as a performance measure in order to compare offer set that purchasing agent receipted."

Especially, Ilbonwanghwan-ilgi is a record of a visit to an enemy country during a war and a work recording Japan by a method that could not be seen in Sahaeng-nok in the early Joseon period. Nevertheless, its volume was rough compared to other Sahaeng-nok, and its theme was not clear, so until now, no active research has been carried out. Sahaeng-nok during the early Joseon period was recorded by the king`s order or a need of the royal court, so it mainly contained limited information about Japan or was written in a direction that a necessary fact would be added to already known information. However, Ilbonwanghwan-ilgi, apart from the method of writing previous Sahaeng-nok, was recorded experiences in Japan in the form of a journal. Hwang Shin recorded every single experience in the journal so as to perceive Japan`s situations in the present time, accurately. He, also, explored a more variety of knowledge about Japan and left it in the form of Mungyeon-nok. Though it did not have an extra title of Mungyeon-nok, when the missions as an envoy ended, Hwang Shin arranged the forms of power, institutions, customs, flora and fauna of Japan on the back page of the journal, following a regular order. This method of description became a model of late Joseon Tongsinsa`s Sahaeng-nok. In addition, he recorded Mungyeon-nok, focusing on the heterogeneities between Joseon and Japan. Unlike early Joseon Tongsinsa`s Sahaeng-nok that aimed to maintain peaceful Gyorin (neighborly relations) System, Ilbonwanghwan-ilgi revealed Joseon`s hostility to Japan as well as the strained relationship between the two countries as it was. This perception of Japan, also, connected to late Joseon Tongsinsa`s Sahaeng-nok, intactly. In this sense, Ilbonwanghwan-ilgi is a material through which we can clearly understand the relationship between Joseon and Japan at the time, which was being transformed by Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592 and a work as an example of late Joseon Tongsinsa`s Sahaeng-nok."

However, this approach has also revealed limits, such as exclusivity and obstructiveness to outsiders. Rethinking the notion of community, Jean-Luc Nancy formulated the concept of “the inoperative community” to overcome these limits and present a new principle that does not assume homogeneity or unity. The inoperative community is the community that regards just “being together” itself as the primary value, so that relationships can exist even by virtue of doing nothing; these new or newly recognized relationships can then create changes in human existence. This paper examines characteristics of the community depicted in the South Korean film Welcome to DongMakGol(Directed by Park Kwang-hyun and produced by Jang Jin·Lee Eun-ha·Ji Sang-yong, 2005) from the perspective of Nancy`s inoperative community. First, it discusses the nature of totalitarian communities and the way the inoperative community deconstructs such traditional notions of communities. Then, it analyzes the community presented in DongMakGol as an inoperative community by analyzing characters and events in the movie. DongMakGol is a place in which a variety of racial, linguistic, ideological, and national identities collide, intersect, and conflict with one another. Since the DongMakGol community does not assume the possibility of a “pure” identity, it doesn`t require people to assimilate into any homogeneous social body and instead transforms itself when newcomers arrive, fostering a “being-together” with them. In particular, the treatment of minorities and “death” in this movie makes cracks in the solidity of immanence, so that these tropes perform a huge role in formulating a “being-together” community. Even though it is unrealistic to build an inoperative community like DongMakGol in real life, it is still meaningful to consider the model of the community we should pursue that it represents."

In this paper, I attempt to analyse unique gaze and desire of Changbi`s Minjung-oriented literary critics. Chapter II deals with the development and transformation of the term ``Minjung`` the literary as well as academic field paying attention to the writings of major critics such as Baek Nak-cheong, Yom Mu-ung, and Shin Kyung-lim. In chapter III, I discuss what motivated them to over/underrepresent Minjung``s field of lives and their bodies. They believe that they can find out the best model for sound body and spirit of Minjung in mean and shabby places in Korean society. According to them, true spirit of Minjung are present in various dialects and slangs they speak in everyday lives. Interestingly enough, their concern with physical materials including Minjung``s voice remind us of Heidegger`s metaphysical thinking of presence what Derrida tried to deconstruct in his philosophical investigations. Although there is explicit inconsistency in Changbi`s Minjung-oriented literary criticism, Changbi played a key role in building, spreading, and supporting progressive thoughts in Korean society. It is the specific circumstance where Changbi can be the manifestation of the oppressed but energetic body of Minjung that made Changbi the most influential media in Korean history."

교육에서 복잡성 이론의 함의,2015,"['Complexity theory', 'Complex systems', 'Complexity thinking', 'self-organisation', 'Determinism', 'Reducationsm']",,"The purpose of this paper explores the complexity theory as a philosophy of education is to look at the possibility of applying sought. In this paper I show how complexity theory has challenged the idea of representation and we explore possibilities for an alternative understanding of knowledge in its relationship to reality. The start of modern science in Europe, has been developed on the basis of mechanistic thinking. According to the Descartes, the operation of bodies, ranging from the grass that grows all the phenomena of the Universe can be expressed in exact formulas, and mathematics to indicate that a given phenomenon to check the analytical methodology is needed. The knowledge gained from the mechanistic view of the world predictions were possible for the unknown. Its core is determinism and reductionism. What is determinism, all that happens in the world can be changed from the beginning so determined and selected according to the laws of dynamics, so undoubtedly goes inevitably evolves. I considers questions of continuity and change in education from the perspective of complexity theory, introducing the field to educationists who might not be familiar with it. Given a significant degree of complexity in a particular environment (or dynamical system````), new properties and behaviours, which are not necessarily contained in the essence of the constituent elements or able to be predicted from a knowledge of initial conditions, will emerge. This turn derives from developments over the past two decades or so within physics, biology, mathematics, ecology, chemistry and economics, from the revival of neo-vitalism in social thought et a1.and from the emergence of a more general ````complex structure of feeling that challenges some everyday notions of social order. Within these scientific disciplines, an array of transformations took place, loosely known as chaos, complexity, non-linearity and dynamical systems analysis. There is a shift from reductionist analyses to those that involve the study of complex adaptive matter that shows ordering but which remains on the edge of chaos. Developed principally in the fields of physics, biology, chemistry and economics, complexity theory arises in some senses out of chaos theory, and before that, catastrophe theory, in that it shares chaos theory`s focus on the sensitivity of phenomena to initial conditions that may result in unexpected and apparently random subsequent properties and behaviours. Jones points out that the term <``complexity is frequently used in a manner which suggests that it is a unified concept, which may contribute to a neglect of tl1e range of different theories that deal with the implications of complexity. The concepts of complex systems include multi-scale hierarchical organisation, emergent patterning, agent-based modelling, dynamical tractors and repellors, information flows and constraints, system-environment interaction, developmental trajectories, selectional ratchets, fitness landscapes, interaction across timescales, and varieties of self-organisation. I suggests that the language, concepts and principles of complexity are central to the development of a new science of qualities to complement the science of quantities that has shaped our understanding of the physical and social worlds. Complexity offers a theoretical framework for acknowledging and helping to sustain the self-organising capacity of fully embodied systems that are realised through the intra- and inter-actions of agents within the boundary that those activities help to generate and sustain. For educators, complexity thinking points to structural conditions that one can implement to help students become aware of how self-consciousness does not precede or follow pedagogical encounters."
A Modern Approach to al-Malakah al-Lisāniyyah in Ibn Khaldun,2015,"['Ibn Khaldūn', 'Linguistic Aptitude', 'Acquisition of Language', 'Definition of Language', 'Linguistic Habit', '이븐 칼둔', '언어적 자질', '언어습득', '언어의 정의', '언어이론', '언어습관']",,"and BookⅠof his historical book 'kitāb al-ʕibar'. The Muqaddimah can be regarded as one of the most perfect historical book in the 14 century considering that it attempted to discover a pattern in the changes that occur in man's political and social organization.Especially, rational in its approach, analytical in its method, it represents an almost complete departure from traditional historiography and conventional concepts beyond the mere chronicles of historical events and the explanation of history.In explaining historical data, Ibn Khaldūn adopted a scientific method totally new to his age, and used new terminologies to drive his ideas and thinking. The Muqaddimah follows a logical arrangement. It begins with man's physical environment and its influence upon him. This is followed by an analysis of primitive social organization, the character of early leadership, and the relationship of primitive human societies with each other, as well as their relationship to the higher, urban form of society. Then government of the state, the highest form of human social organization, is discussed in general and that of the Caliphate, the special Muslim case, in particular. Ibn Khaldūn tried to explain how the higher human social organization is formed from primitive human societies. It is followed with suggesting some terminologies such as 'tamaddun' (urbanization), 'ʕumrān'(civilization), and 'ʕaṣabiyyah' (solidarity, group consciousness). In this paper, it is not needed to explain each of them, but the focus should be centered on the term 'malakah' (aptitude). Ibn Khaldūn used this term to answer to theproblem of how all higher civilization is preserved. He considered 'malakah' as a factor to make a man master a craft or a science through continuous practice, thus making it 'habit'. Since the acquisition of habits is a matter of education and training, habits can be passed on to others willing and fit to learn them.The aim of this paper is to make a modern approach to the conception of al-malakah al-lisāniyyah (the linguistic aptitude) which takes the most important position in Ibn Khaldun's study of language.In an obvious sense, it is a re-interpretation of al-malakah al-lisāniyyah from a modern linguistic point of view. This approach leads us to recognizing the continuance of the method of linguistic study by comparing between Ibn Khaldun's views of language which were totally developed to his age and some modern linguists' theories, especially generative transformational theory.In order to accomplish the aim, this paper will, in the second chapter, deal with Ibn Khaldūn's definition of language and compare it with some modern linguists’ definition. In the third chapter, the definition of al-malakah al-lisāniyyah will be made with the prescription of its conditions and preconditions. Likewise, the comparison between al-malakah al-lisāniyyah and linguistic competence by Chomsky will be made to assure the theoretical relations between them through the language acquisition. This will give us a clear answer to the question we might ask “Why compare al-malakah al-lisāniyyah with Chomsky's work rather than alternative models such as those developed by Brame, Bresnan, Gazdar and others.” In the last chapter, this paper will present the method of Ibn Khaldūn's linguistic study - the descriptive and explanatory method,stressing the necessity of recognizing that his linguistic method has been influenced by the historical method."
"Book Review : John P. Dimoia, Reconstructing Bodies: Biomedicine, Health, and Nation-building in South Korea since 1945 (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2013)",2015,[],,"It is a delight to encounter new books on the history of medicine in Korea by a foreign scholar. John P. Dimoia’s book is particularly welcome given the scarcity of scholarly work on the topic, even within the Korean academic community. The book covers the period from the United States Army Military Government in Ko-rea (USAMGIK, 1945-1948) to the emergence of plastic surgery in contemporary Korea. At first sight, the breadth of topics covered in the book was a source of con-cern. However, the author cleverly weaves the diverse subjects along the axes of the transfer of biomedical technology, nation-building, and reconstruction of the body. Furthermore, these subjects are presented against the backdrop of the emer-gence of “invasive” technologies in South Korea.  A scholar with a traditional perspective on the history of medicine would not be able to comprehend how the subjects covered in the book, from anti-parasite cam-paign to plastic surgery, could result in a coherent narrative. From the traditional, or big history, approach, these subjects have distinct characteristics: anti-parasite campaign appears to be an old nostalgic memory of the nation’s development; in contrast, plastic surgery is a social illness created by contemporary medicine. However, the author manages to link these subjects through an active acceptance of hybrid technology along with the desire for development and renovation, rather than focusing on their apparent differences.  In Reconstructing Bodies, the author selects six sites to make his argument. The first site is the “fragmented” character of the Korean medical community after World War II, which included both biomedical and traditional practices. Second, he focuses on the disease prevention activities of the USAMGIK, including mass inoculation and DDT spraying, in response to the devastated circumstances per-ceived by the military authorities. Third is the Minnesota Project (1954-1962), an emergent model for modernizing local hospitals through American and internation-al aid, which led to the making of the Korean body as an object of biomedical re-search. Fourth is family planning, which mobilized the state with new and aggres- sive technologies, such as birth control devices, and promoted a revised conception of the family and reproductive behaviors under the Park Chung Hee regime. Fifth is the national anti-parasite campaign that enforced thousands of children in the public school system to submit their stool samples for scientific examination. The sixth and final site is the aesthetic and plastic surgery in contemporary Korea, which shows the recent transformation of biomedical practice within the broader historical context.  The strength of the book lies in its unique perspective, which allows the con-struction of a consistent narrative of the broad field of Korean medicine after 1945. In this research field, the conventional approach was to focus on the remarkable development and expansion of medicine, highlighting the roles of key Korean medical scholars who served as founding fathers. The myth that Korean medicine developed rapidly from the disastrous condition after the war is at the core of the historiography of modern medicine in Korea. Any attempt to counter this central myth would have led to such contradictions as “compressed growth” with the con-comitant side effects. However, Reconstructing Bodies shows that there can be an alternative to the dichotomy of development and anti-development. While this book does not deny the dramatic development of Korean medicine during the last seven decades, it also focuses on the transformative process of biomedical technol-ogy within specific socio-political conditions and the relationship between the sub-ject/bodies and the nation-building ideology. The author explores the experience of the bodies in Korea by tracing the “transfer” rather than the “development” of med-icine.  The author makes his argument based on deliberately selected materials for each site. In analyzing each site of inquiry, he chooses the items that show the compre-hensive aspects of the site and explores the case at the micro-level. For example, to describe the Minnesota Project, he closely follows Dr. Lee Young-Gyun’s activi-ties and reveals the transformation and transplantation of Western medical knowledge such as heart surgery in Korea through the lens of Dr. Lee. Each de-scription of the site begins with a brief summary and moves toward more detailed descriptions of specific items. To make this item-based approach stronger, the au-thor covers an extensive array of Korean and English sources and uses them thor-oughly. In short, the prominent advantage of the book is the meticulous arrange-ment of the sources that strengthen its item-based approach.  However, arguments on the “sites” seem to be slightly weak in contrast to the strong arguments on the “items,” which are corroborated by plentiful resources. Occasionally, the descriptions of the sites are not based on historical resources. For example, in making the argument on the material basis of the development of med-icine, the author explains that biomedical research and autopsy increased in the postwar period. However, autopsy cases in hospitals grew at a much slower rate than the general development of medicine. Moreover, the statistics on autopsy has been excluded from hospital statistics after the 1980s, during which hospitals be-came for-profit entities. Therefore, further explanation on the distortion of biomed- ical knowledge and practice within the context of commercialized medicine in Ko-rea would make a more balanced narrative with the distortion under the nation-building ideology. This would have made Chapter 6 (“Reconstructing the Face”) more convincing.  Despite some weaknesses, Reconstructing Bodies adds much to the historiog-raphy of modern medicine in Korea. Studying the history of Korean medicine be-tween 1945 and the 1960s is difficult largely due to the lack of reliable sources, a difficulty that this book also reflects. Nevertheless, the author manages to unearth an impressive array of resources on the topic. Also, the book provides a useful per-spective, other than developmentalism, to analyze the field. The author’s perspec-tive is surely not the only way to analyze the many scenes in the history of Korean medicine in the post-liberation era. However, I hope that new lines of research will emerge based on the richness and uniqueness of this book."

Its research object was totally 40 persons of 20 students of the 4th to the 6th Grades from Sulsan Elementary School, Gunsan, and 20 students of the 3rd to the 6th Grades from Elementary Schools of Community Child Center around Iksan city. Its research period lasted for 4 months from September to December, 2014, and I, as the research place, used the art room at Sulsan Elementary School, and the lecture room of Hands-on Science Class, Wonkwang University, Iksan. The programs were totally 8 sessions with a unit of 1 session per 20 persons for 2 hours from 1:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon every Friday and Saturday.  I fixed four themes of this program-one plane modeling, and three solid modeling, and finished the work of storytelling during summer vacation. The plane modeling is ‘Meeting with The Shadow Monster and Goblin’, and the solid modelings are ‘Seeking for a Bluebird in My Mind’, ‘Making a Sweet Home’ and ‘A Tale of My Friend Made of Scrap Irons’.  Then I utilized exclusive techniques of art expression according to each theme, which were in sequence silk screen, Korean paper art, clay formation, and Junk art techniques. And I delivered the scientific knowledge in terms of growing or manufacturing processes of materials used in making artworks.  After being processed this program, I surveyed about the students’ ability of integrated thinking and emotional experience by the questionnaire, and took statistics with SPSS/window 12.0. And I converted the subject’s variables to a percentage, and executed the x2(chi-square) test in order to compare with the characteristic according to variable  As a result, as for the student’s ability of integrated thinking, the percentage of the students to have responded the contents of this program as ‘This program was useful, for it led me to display my creative ideas’ was 89.3, and especially that as ‘This program was very useful, for it led me to display my creative ideas’ was 41.3. And, as for the student’s emotional experience, the percentage of the students to have responded the contents of this program as ‘This program was interesting and satisfactory, for it made me enjoyable’ was 88.5, and especially that as ‘This program was very interesting and satisfactory, for it made me enjoyable’ was 55.5.  Judging from the statistic values of two fields such as the student’s ability of integrated thinking and emotional experience, I estimate that over the majority of the students showed enhancement in self-confident creative expression as well as higher interest and concern through this program.   The result that I arranged and analyzed the making process of artworks, the photos of the resultant, questionnaire, etc. as such is as follows :   Firstly, as a result that I proceeded this program as art-centered STEAM class, the student’s systematic problem-solving ability was improved in his ability of integrated thinking to transform the literary contents into artistic one.  Secondly, the student obtained the emotional experience such as interest in the class, selfconfidence, intellectual satisfaction, self-fulfillment, etc. through art-centered STEAM class using four art expression techniques.  Thirdly, the student’s mind willing to cooperate, communicate with his friends, and care for them was ripened in the process of problem-solving.   Fourth, the student’s self-confidence was further instilled when presenting famous artist and his artworks in the introduction and finale of four art expression techniques.  Likewise, the statistic values on the fields of student’s ability of integrated thinking and emotional experience illustrate that over the majority of the students showed improvement in the ability of creative expression with confidence as well as higher int"
조선후기 야담에 나타나는 노구의 특징과 의미,2015,"['Kisaeng', 'negative goddess', 'Yadam', 'Nogu', '꼭두각시', '할미', '기생', 'Halmi', 'Deviant women', 'Kkodugaksi', '요귀', '노구', '조선후기 야담', '일탈형 여성', '부정적 여신']","노구(老?)는 고대사회에서 종교의 사제, 왕의 조력자, 왕가의 연분과 관련한 일을 담당한 여성이지만 중세사회에서는 그 위상이 추락하여 양가 자제와 여염집 유부녀의 불륜을 조장하는 비속한 여성으로 나타난다. 그러나 한편으로 여신이나 월하노인의 이미지를 가진 신성한 여성으로 인식된 점을 볼 때, 성과 속의 복합적 성격을 가진 인물로 사료된다. 노구에 대한 그간의 연구는 추상적 특징을 제시하는 데 머물 뿐 구체적인 모습과 그것이 우리 문학에 어떻게 반영되는가는 충분히 살피지 못했다. 따라서 본고는 조선 후기 야담을 텍스트로 하여 노구에 대한 당대 사람들의 인식, 노구의 신분과 직업 및 활동 등을 살피고, 야담에 나타나는 이러한 특징이 조선후기 놀이문학과 이야기문학에 나타나는 일탈형 여성과 어떻게 연결될 수 있는가를 고찰하고자 한다. 야담에 나타나는 노구의 특징은 크게 세 가지로 살필 수 있다. 첫째, 경이롭고 두려운 요귀로 인간에게 해악을 끼친다. 다만 거구, 완력, 베짜기, 집을 관장하는 신격 등의 소재를 통해 일반적인 요귀가 아닌 고대의 창조 여신과 관련하여 인식되었음을 알 수 있다. 둘째, 주인공의 일을 돕는 숨은 능력자의 모습을 가지고 있다. 이때 노구는 표면적으로는 위기나 곤란에 빠진 주인공을 돕고 있지만 그것이 결국 국가나 왕에 대한 조력으로 이어지는 특징이 있다. 셋째, 기생이나 술과 관련한 미천한 일에 종사하는 늙은 여자이다. 노구의 직업은 기생어미, 사당, 주모, 약을 파는 상인, 청루의 포주 등으로 나온다. 그런데 다모나 의녀의 경우 기생을 겸한 것을 볼 때, 노구의 직업은 기생, 의녀, 다모, 사당을 중심으로 한 하나의 범주를 형성한 것으로 볼 수 있다. 야담은 여느 문헌에 비해 노구의 구체적인 모습을 잘 보여주고 있고, 이를 통해 우리는 노구가 조선후기 문학에 미친 영향을 추론할 수 있다. 먼저 놀이문학에서 노구는 가면극의 할미와 꼭두각시를 형상화하는 데에 본보기가 되었다. 그 근거로 할미의 원형이 창조의 신, 대모신의 신성한 신격이라는 점과 또 극 중 할미의 직업이 노구와 유사한 사당, 포주, 무속인인 점을 들 수 있다. 즉 신을 인격화하는 데 있어 노구는 구체적인 본보기가 되었던 것이다. 이야기문학에서는 의 뺑덕어미, 의 괴똥어미, ?꼭두각시전?의 이부인, 의 옹녀 등 유교적 규범에서 일탈한 여성을 표현하는 데 영향을 주었다. 이들 일탈형 여성들이 가진 물욕, 식욕, 색욕, 수면욕은 당시 사회에서는 부정적 으로 인식되었지만, 한편으로 체제에 구속되지 않는 인간의 본성과 원초적 카오스에 대한 향수를 일으킨다. 이처럼 인간적 본성이 집약된 여성상이 조선후기 문학 전반에 형상화된 데에는 이들과 가장 가까운 거리에 있었던 여성, 즉 노구의 모습이 영향을 주었을 것이다.","Nogu(老?, an old lady) was in charge of the love affairs related to priests, royal assistants and royal families in the ancient times, changing into a vulgar woman aggravating illicit love between sons from a good family and middle-class married women in the medieval society. She, on the other hand, was considered a sacred woman with an image of goddess or Weolhanoin(月下老人). In other words, Nogu had a combined character with the divine and the worldly. This research shows Nogu’ social status, occupations, specific activities and her significance associated with immoral women described in the entertainments and narratives based on the Yadam in the late Joseon Dynasty. Nogu is largely classified into three characters in the romantic folktales. First, she was a mysterious and dreadful ghost doing people harms. However, it is noticed that she was not a common ghost but a negatively transformed figure from the ancient creating goddess who had taken control over a giant, forcing power, a loom and housing. Secondly, she has an image of a hidden able person to help main characters. Considering this image viewed in folktales including Yeoyongsa and a celebrated doctor, Yusang, Nogu was seemingly helping main characters in danger and trouble, finally turning into a role of helping a nation or a king. Lastly, she was an old woman who engaged in humble jobs containing Kisaeng and drinks. Nogu’s jobs are referred to as Kisaeng’s mother, Sadang, a barkeeper, a vendor selling remedies, a keeper of a brothel, and so on. But, given that Damo or a doctor assistant played combined roles of Kisaeng, those jobs account for one category of putting all of Kisaeng, a doctor assistant, Damo and Sadang together. These aspects of Nogu have had great influence on a view of women in the late Joseon literature. First of all, Nogu became a role model shaping the images of Halmi and Kkokdugaksi in mask play in the entertainments. There are some grounds in that a goddess of season and Mother goddess are the prototypes of Halmi and Halmi’s jobs are similar to those of Nogu. Nogu, namely, grew a detailed model to express a divine being as a human being. Nogu has had an impact on displaying the women who would escape from Confucian tradition, such as Ppaengdeukeumi of Simcheongga, Koiddongeumi of Bokseonhwaeumga, Mrs. Lee of Kkokdugaksijeon and Ongnyeo of Byeonkangsoiga in the narratives. The desires of materials, appetite, sex and sleep which immoral women indulged in were regarded as rejected in those days, which has provoked nostalgia for unrestrained human nature and instinctive chaos. Likewise, the looks of Nogu, who had the closest relations with these women, seem to have had an effect on the image of woman with intensified human nature widely represented in the late Joseon literature."

Among the work, it is notable that new icons appear in many woodcut prints of Buddhist scriptures promoted by the royal family. This study investigates the origin of the new icons and contexts of their inflow. Specifically, this study focuses on the circumstantial background of their publication and on the woodcut prints with the new icons in that period. It is well known that the queen and the royal concubine engaged in the Buddhist work by the royal family in the early Joseon. However, postscripts in relevant written prayers and published scriptures indicate that men in the royal family such as the king, princes(i.e Prince Hyoryeong), and relatives actively supported the Buddhist work. Despite the suppression of Buddhism in this period, such Buddhist work could be done because the royal family was in charge of it and its purpose conforms with Confucian values, i.e. well-being and prosperity of the royal family and prayers for the dead parents. Twenty woodcut prints promoted by the royal family in the 15th century are handed down. Two manuscripts with transformation painting can be included, and that makes 22 transformation images in total. Among them, fourteen prints have the new icons. This new icons are noteworthy as they represent woodcut prints of Joseon and such prints continued to be produced throughout the dynasty. Moreover, they became a model of woodcut prints of the future. Six woodcut prints imply the inflow of the new icons: either by the postscripts in woodcut prints promoted by the Joseon royal family which record that the new icons are modeled after the icons in Chinese prints, or by the resemblance between the new icons in woodcut prints of Joseon and China. Based on these six prints, the channel how the icons flew in could be presumed, and WHO participated in the publication and HOW the social aspect was in that period seem to be the key. Specifically, the rulers of the early Joseon such as King Sejong and Sejo(世祖), and Queen Cheonghee-wanghoo(貞熹王后) and Insu -daebi(仁粹大妃), were favorable to Buddhism so that they were eager to issue Buddhist scriptures. This seems to have led envoys to purchase Chinese Buddhist scriptures, and those scriptures were used as the basis of Buddhist scriptures promoted by the royal family of Joseon. A clear and better understanding is limited at present, due to the fact that not sufficient record is available regarding envoys of early Joseon to Ming of China. However, further studies on relevant records of China and collected works of high officials of that period would bring more data/materials for this research."

It was unlike the Gun/Hyeon system, in which local  prefects were dispatched from the central to other regions, as representatives of the  central government. In reality the classical enfeoffemnt system was not employed, at least to the letter, since  the days of the Ancient Han(漢) days. The idea behind the system, however, had a powerful influence upon other areas of administration as it was still being regarded as the ideal  system. The idea was composed of various elements that would keep the appeal of the  system, in the eyes of the subjects and not to mention the leaders: such as the relationship  between the Emperor and the feudal lords, universe’s(九州) 5-class(五服) Mourning Attire system(or  the 9-class Mourning Attire system[九服]), the Royal vicinity(王畿) and Outlying Safeguards(藩屛), as well as the Central(國) and the Surrounding zone(野). Examined in this  article are all these concepts, as well as the perceptions the people had back then, in order  to determine how feudal ideals were reflected in medieval capitals. This world of universal order was a world that would have many other smaller worlds inside,  all spreading outward in a concentric fashion, yet sharing the same center where the  Emperor was living. Distance from the central would dictate the level of relationship that  region enjoyed with the central, and also the central’s potential treatment of the region. Due  to such environment, since the Southern Sung era, a notion of a decentralized political  structure, composed of both the Emperor who directly ruled a relatively small center(王畿)  and feudal lords in charge of their own regions, both pursuing a peaceful civil governing,  was ideologically established. Both the Goryeo dynasty, and the Joseon dynasty in its early days, tried to establish their  own status in their realms, which represented not only discrimination (from the center) but  also autonomy (in their own realm). Even with the advent of the Mongol Yuan empire, and  its intervention in Korean affairs, the Goryeo Confucian scholars at the time intended to  describe their own status and the world as a peaceful regime and a stabilized order. Their  efforts and aspiration continued to hone with the advent of Ming. Within the purview of civil ruling, feudal lords governed their respective realms  autonomously, and the capital became the symbol and center of such governing, which would ultimately all tie into the main capital of the Emperor himself. Capital cities, the embodiment of political  power of individual states, were regional centers that characterized such senior order, and  also pillars which sustained it. Such a way was universal, and also absolute, and at the  same time ubiquitous, as the capitals could exist in multiple places. The world of the  civilized and the world of the barbarians were different, but there was always a room for the  latter to transform itself into the former. The capitals of the lords and capitals of the Emperor were virtually centric positions placed  on different levels of a hierarchic order. ‘Protocols(禮),’ or any set of conduct codes for  that matter, served as a format or method that would allow a civilization demonstrate itself.  Through the task of devising a series of dynastic ritual codes, Joseon wanted to establish a governance based upon protocols and codes of conduct. It shows that Joseon was not  interested in creating a power base that would allow itself to rule the people with force. It shows that it was really trying to create a benevolent governance based upon ideals. The  result was a governing model that even the Confucian classical texts would not dare  suggest, a model that took both reality and ideals into account, so that it would become a new  experiment in dynastic governing."

Although the papacy already lost his authority after ‘Outrage of Anagni’ in 1303 and his settlement at Avignon, a series of political crises of French kingdom begun in 1315 permitted John XXII, pope of Avignon to restore the papacy in conformity with the pastoral idea. He could establish an elaborate administration and finance system on this basis. Meanwhile, at the time of oubreak of the Hundred Years’ War, the pope lost definitely the status as universal and spiritual leader of Western Europe. In this context, it is necessary to focus on the Conference of Vincennes in 1333 as a definite moment for loss of papacy in Western Europe.Philip VI of Valois, who have ascended to the throne as a collateral line of Capetian dynasty, prepared extensively the crusade expedition as a way of legitimation of his kingship. And John XXII assisted him both materially and morally as spiritual leader on the level of dispensation. On the other hand, John XXII proposed his own specific theory on the Beatific Vision and Philip VI organized a conference in order to investigate this theme with various theologians of University of Paris at his manor of Vincennes in 1333. Of course, this conference was profoundly theological, but it involved also a declaration of independence of French kingship from the papacy. Finally, the thesis of pope John XXII was judged heretic and John XXII died of shock soon.After the conference, three phenomena appeared: 1) formation of Thomist doctrin around the University of Paris; 2) establishment between the French kingship and the university of Paris; 3) unexpected outbreak of the Hundred Years’ War after failure of crusade project with the death of John XXII and the accession of Benedict XII. The conference at Vincennes cannot be an immediate cause of these three phenomena, but a turning point marking a decline of Papal universalism and its replacement for new orders in various areas."
Estimation of Side Lobes in Ultrasound Imaging Systems,2015,"['Discrete Fourier transform', 'Side lobe estimation', 'Spatial frequency', 'Suppression', 'Ultrasound imaging']",,"Purpose We propose a new method of estimating the sidelobe levels from received ultrasound channel data.Methods Ultrasound signals impinging on an array transducermanifest themselves as sinusoids whose spatial frequencyvaries as a function of the incident angle. The receivedchannel data from the main lobe direction have a spatialfrequency of zero when considered across all the channelsbecause individual channel data have the same phase in thetemporal domain, while those from the side lobe directionshave a spatial frequency that is not zero and varies with theultrasound beam incident direction. Thus, the receivedchannel data can be modeled as a sinusoidal waveform thathas a specific frequency depending on the incident angle.The side lobe components are modeled as a sum ofsinusoidal waves that have a frequency equal to an integerplus a half. We estimated the side lobe waveform that has aninteger-plus-a-half frequency by adaptively varying thewindow length in the spectrum estimation. The effect of sidelobes on ultrasound image can be reduced by subtracting theestimated side lobe waveform in receive focusing.Results To confirm the efficacy of the proposed method,ultrasound field simulations and experiments were carriedout. We observed that the 1st to 5th spatial frequency sidelobes estimated using the proposed method were present atthe same positions as the side lobes in the field response. Bysubtracting the waveforms of the 1st to 20th spatialfrequency side lobes, we reduced the side lobe levels by upto 14 dB. Experiments on wire phantoms in a water tank alsoconfirmed that the proposed method can estimate and reducethe side lobe levels.Conclusions We have proposed a new method of estimatingand canceling side lobes that is validated through bothsimulation and experiment."

This thesis proposes a LSM rotary type tesitng machine which rotates at the speed of up to 600km/h. And the mechanical stress is considered in order that the safety factor remains above 1.5 at the maximum speed. In addition, because normal force as well as thrust occurs in the machine, the normal force exerted was considered through the strength analysis. Finally, a design plan which enables to weaken the normal force affecting the rotary type testing machine is introduced and its validity is proved by the results of FEM analysis."
현대 패션에 나타난 스포티즘 디자인 특성 연구,2015,"['스포티즘', '디자인 특성', '디자인 조형요소', 'Sportism', 'Design Characteristics', 'Design Modeling Element']","스포츠웨어는 단순히 스포츠 활동을 위한 기능성과 활동성 외에도 미적 욕구를 충족시킬 수 있는 새로운 패션으로 발전하였다. 스포츠웨어는 일시적인 유행현상이 아니라 웰빙(Well-being)과 레저(Leisure)를 중시하는 사회문화적 현상과 함께 패션 현상으로 자리잡고 있어 다양한 형태로 나타난다. 그러므로 현대 패션에 나타나는 스포티즘(Sportism)에 대한 다각적인 연구의 필요성이 제기되고 있다. 따라서 본 연구는 현대 패션에 영향을 미치는 스포티즘의 개념과 변천사에 대하여 고찰하고 스포티즘 디자인의 특성을 분석해보고자 한다. 또한 최근 스포티즘이 재조명되기 시작한 2012년에서 2014년까지의 세계 4대 컬렉션인 파리, 밀라노, 뉴욕, 런던의 봄·여름(S/S), 가을·겨울(F/W) 컬렉션에 나타난 스포티즘 패션의 조형요소인 아이템, 실루엣, 소재, 색채, 디테일의 특성을 분석하고자한다. 스포티즘 패션의 조형적 요소와 유형을 분석하기 위해 선행연구의 조형적 요소를 기준으로 스타일닷컴(www.style.com)을 통해 시각적 자료를 선정하였다. 시각적 자료 선정은 2012년 S/S시즌부터 2014년 F/W 시즌까지 최근 3년의 4대 컬렉션으로 중심으로 하였으며, 총 17,448장의 컬렉션 사진 중에서 시각적 자료의 객관성을 위해 패션디자인 전공자(석사학위 이상 소지자) 5인의 FGI(Focus Group Interview)를 통해 스포티즘 디자인 사진 265장을 최종적으로 선별하였다. 선별된 265장을 토대로 디자인 조형적 요소(아이템, 실루엣, 소재, 색채, 디테일)에 따른 디자인 특성을 분석하였다. 연구결과는 다음과 같다. 스포티즘이 반영된 패션은 팬츠, 스커트, 원피스 등의 생동감 있고 캐주얼한 아이템을 활용하여, 직선적인 스트레이트 실루엣이 가장 많이 나타났다. 소재는 계절에 상관없이 편안하고 활동적인 소프트(Soft)한 소재가 가장 많았으며, 색상은 전체적으로 무채색의 빈도가 높게 나타났다. 스포티즘이 반영된 것이라 판별할 수 있는 디테일인 후드, 포켓, 지퍼 등의 디테일은 파리 컬렉션에서 가장 다양하게 나타났으며, 기능적인 디테일이 많이 나타났다. 스포티즘에 나타난 특성은 기능성, 단순성, 관능성, 역동성, 미래지향성, 구축성의 6가지로 나누어 살펴볼 수 있다. 첫째, 기능성으로 대표되는 디자인 특성은 아노락, 윈드브레이커 등의 스포티한 아이템에 스트레이트한 실루엣, 벌키(Bulky)한 소재, 무채색의 활용, 벨크로, 드로스트링 등의 기능적인 디테일이 사용되었다. 이는 신체를 보호하고 보온성을 높이는 등의 기능성이 부각된 것으로 볼 수 있다. 둘째, 단순성은 재킷, 팬츠, 스커트 등의 아이템이 스트레이트 실루엣으로 주로 표현되며, 스티프(Stiff) 한 소재에 무채색을 활용하고 디테일을 최소한으로 배제시킨 것이 특징으로 나타났다. 셋째, 관능성은 바디수트, 미니스커트, 쇼츠 등의 아이템을 활용하여 바디컨셔스한 실루엣으로 나타나는데, 소재 역시 여성의 인체를 강조하기 좋은 일래스틱(Elastic)이나 시스루(See-through)소재를 활용하였다. 색상은 원색이 주를 이루었고 파이핑, 바인딩, 버클 등의 디테일이 활용되었다. 넷째, 역동성은 활동성을 중점으로 미니스커트나 블루종 재킷, 윈드브레이커 등의 아이템에 스트레이트 실루엣이나 벌크 실루엣이 나타났다. 또한 소프트하거나 크리습한 소재와 다양한 원색 중심의 디자인이 보여지며 포켓이나 드로스트링, 벨크로, 지퍼, 스냅, 버클 등의 다양한 디테일이 나타났다. 다섯째, 미래지향성은 메탈릭(Metallic)한 소재의 사용이 특징적이며 스트레이트 실루엣이나 벌크 실루엣의 모터사이클 재킷이나 아노락 등이 보였다. 디테일로는 버클이나 금속성의 지퍼나 바인딩, 파이핑 등이 사용되었다. 마지막으로 구축성은 주로 재킷과 원피스의 아이템이 나타났는데, 벌크, 크립습, 스티프 소재 등 부피감이 있는 소재의 사용으로 벌크 실루엣이나 아워글라스 실루엣이 나타났다. 또한 무채색이나 중간색의 색상에 지퍼나 드로스트링과 같은 디테일이 사용되었다. 현대 패션에 나타난 스포티즘 디자인은 스포츠를 즐기기 위한 기능성뿐만 아니라 패션으로 나타낼 수 있는 미적 욕구를 충족시킴으로써 다양하게 시도되고 있음을 알 수 있었다. 또한 스포티즘이 하나의 패션 코드로 자리 잡아 일시적인 유행이 아닌 주요 사회문화 트렌드로서의 주요역할을 하고 있음을 알 수 있었다.","Sportswear transforms itself into a new fashion item to satisfy desires for beauty in addition to having functionality and movability for sports activities. Sportswear is not in fashion just temporarily but comes in various forms along with sociocultural phenomenon that put emphasis on well-being and leisure. Thus, the need for studying sportism at various levels observed in modern fashion is raised. Therefore, this study explores the history and concept of sportism that has an influence in modern fashion and analyses design characteristics of sportism. Furthermore, it aims to analyse the formative elements of sportism fashion including items, silhouettes, textures, colors, and design characteristics that were seen in the world’s four major S/S and F/W collections in Paris, Milan, New York, and London between 2012 and 2014, during which recent sportism gained attention again. For analysis of types and formative elements of sportism fashion, visual data was collected from www.style.com based on the formative elements used in former studies. the selection of visual data was conducted focusing on the major four collections of the last three years from S/S selection in 2012 to F/W selection in 2014, and of a collection of the 17,448 photos, 265 photos of sportism design were selected at the end through a Focus Group Interview (FGI) of five fashion majors with Master’s degree in fashion for the objectivity of visual data. Based on the 265 photos, design characteristics were analysed according to design formative elements which are items, silhouettes, textures, colors, and details. The study results are as follows. Fashion reflecting sportism has many straight silhouettes, using lively and casual items such as pants, skirts, and dresses. Regardless of seasons, many items are composed of comfortably and lively soft items, and gray colors take up the most part in general. Details that reflect sportism such as hoods, pockets, and zippers were seen in Paris collection in a variety of ways, particularly regarding functionality. Characteristics in sportism can be categorized into the six parts of functionality, simplicity, sexuality, movability, and future-orientedness, and constructivity. First, when it comes to functionality, straight silhouettes, bulky items, gray colors, Velcros, drawstrings were added to sports items like an anorak or a windbreaker. It can be said that functionality was focused on to increase the warmth of clothing in order to protect the body. Second, simplicity was expressed with straight silhouettes using items such as jackets, pants, skirts, etc. by using stiff texture and minimizing details. Third, sexuality was expressed with bodyconscious silhouettes using items such as body suites, miniskirts, and shorts by using elastic or see-through textures to highlight the female body. Primary colors were used most, and details such as piping, binding, buckles were used. Fourth, movability was expressed with straight or bulk silhouettes using items such as miniskirts, Blouson jackets, wind breakers. Furthermore, soft and crisp textures and various primary colors were shown, and various details were presented with pockets, drawstrings, Velcro, zippers, snaps, buckles, etc. Fifth, future-orientedness was characteristic of metallic texture, and was expressed with motorcycle jackets and anoraks having straight or bulk silhouette. Their details include buckles and metallic zipper, binding, or piping. Last, constructivity was presented with jackets and dresses using bulky, crisp, stiff textures, which was represented as bulk silhouette and hour-glass silhouette. In addition, gray or neutral color was used with details such as zippers and drawstrings. It can be said that sportism design seen in modern fashion is attempted at various levels by satisfying desires for beauty presented with fashion as well as for functionality allowing for sports activities. Furthermore, sportism becomes a fashion code of sorts, playing a major rol"
자연과학편 : 개별적 마커모형에 의한 표본이 회전중심 추정에 미치는 영향,2015,"['soft tissue artefact', 'center of rotation', 'fitting method', 'transformation method', 'estimation']",,"STA, soft tissue artefact, takes a huge proportion of errors in photogrammetry. In order to estimate the center of rotation of a human joint with markers having STA, one should use the optimal estimation method in various situations. The purpose of this study is to compare two method of estimating the center of rotation, fitting and transformation methods, given factors of STA magnitude and of functional movements. For combinations of three levels of STA magnitude and three levels of functional movement, each of independent 1000 simulation experiments was performed. The results showed that the bias and the variance of estimator of transformation method had smaller amount than that of fitting method. Therefor, it can be concluded that the transformation method was superior to the fitting method."

Since the conventional algorithm is based on the intensity of pixels, its false alarm rate may increase in such indoor light conditions. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm uses information of gradient vector of pixel intensity variance based on local binary patterns (i.e., gradient-vector based image transform), resulting in insensitivity to light change situations. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified in terms of false alarm rates through simulation results."

He insists that a work should be able to serve as text for performance and at the same time to gain the sympathy of contemporaries. For this aim, Lee Yun Taek uses such techniques as disorganization and reorganization. Disorganization and reorganization do not conflict with each other but are complementary concepts which separate and reorganize the elements of a play to make a new work having new significance.  Lee Yun Taek borrowed the format of the ""play in a play"" in his work『Faust in Blue Jean』in a try to secure Korean contemporaneity by citing the contents of the original in a reduced form. He transformed the spatial and timely background of the original to the Korean version in the 90s, placing focus on critical events of the then times.  The writer even ventured to reconstruct the figures of the original for the purpose of intensifying the dramatic meaning and fun. He didn""t change the names of the figures in the original to Korean ones to heighten the effect of strangeness or ""Verfremdungseffekt"". Usage of the names that are not well-matched with locality was designed to keep a certain distance from criticism concerning behaviors or awareness of the characters in the play. By typifying the plots of figures and characters of the play, the reality and sociality of the play could be amplified and their action became more predictable.  『Faust in Blue Jean』is an example of Lee Yun Taek""s playwriting technique <Now-Here-We> showing his efforts to detail in the drama the structures of Korean timely situation as well as political and social life by paraphrasing the original『Faust』. The writer pursued significance and fun simultaneously in his recreation of Western classical dramas. It is his unique approach to set himself free from sentimental realism which seeks for cheap and meaningless fun and from immature copycat playwriting which pursues only meaning with no fun."
