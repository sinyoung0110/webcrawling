Analyzing the Consistency of Business Process Based on Behavioral Petri Net,2015,"['Behavioral Petri net', 'Behavioral distance vector', 'Interactive process model', 'Behavior compatibility']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Analyzing the consistency is the important part of business process management (BPM). Existing researches only consider the structural consistency of process model, or analyzing the single data. However, sometimes, the model is consistency without considering data in real life, while it is inconsistency after analyzing control and data. In this paper, based on the labeled behavioral Petri net, considering the change of data, the control flow and data flow of business process model is established from the perspective of partner process, and then obtains the interactive process model by interacting them. In the end, according behavior profile and behavior mapping, the behavior vector of the mapping transitions is given to calculate the behavioral distance vector and gets the behavior compatibility between the corresponding process models. If all behavior compatibilities can close to 1, BPM is consistency, and vice versa. In addition, it is proven that the method is valid by analyzing the theory and example."

The forecasting results under the alternative scenario are in line with theoretical expectations. The 2014 Farm Bill is forecasted to decrease expected net returns (ENRs) for producers. The expected changes are in favor of consumers at the cost of producer surplus. Without substantially affecting producers’ planting decision, the 2014 Farm Bill is forecasted to contribute to the Federal budget deficit reduction."
An SLA-oriented Multiparty Trust Negotiation Model based on HCPN in Cloud Environment,2015,"['Multiparty Trust Negotiation', 'Hierarchical Colored Petri Net', 'Cloud Computing', 'Service Level Agreement', 'Genetic Algorithm']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The negotiation on Service Level Agreement (SLA) in current complex cloud environment often involves the multilateral negotiation. Therefore, this paper presents an SLA-oriented multiparty trust negotiation model based on Hierarchical Colored Petri Net (HCPN) in cloud environment. This model mainly provides trust negotiation of SLA parameters such as credibility, reliability, availability and service price so on for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Cloud Service Consumers (CSCs), thus making complex process description of multiparty trust negotiation on SLA in cloud environment simple and efficient. On the basis of the HCPN model on SLA, this paper puts forward a multi-objective optimization algorithm for SLA trust negotiation. Simulation results show that the algorithm not only improves efficiency of multilateral negotiation, but also avoids QoS negotiation falling into local optimization."

Failure Recovery Dependency Analysis for Web Composition Transactions Based on Extended Petri-Nets,2015,"['Transactional Composition Web Services', 'Task Dependency', 'Compensation', 'Execution log']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"For transactional Composition Web Services (CWS), traditional transaction theory in the database is introduced into the Long Running Transactions (LRTs) domain. In practical application, the typical LRTs employ forward or backward rollback. In order to improve the expansibility of LRTs, it is important to accurately specify the dependency between tasks in composition transaction; contemporary technologies usually statically specify dependency point and avoid implicit interaction in LRTs. In this paper, we propose a task dependency modeling method for LRTs, firstly we present formal description of atomic Web Services (WS) and discuss atomic WS such as pivot, compensable, retriable and vital, then execution logs of LRTs data dependency and action dependency rules between tasks in LRTs are analyzed, specify, finally application of TRP shows that it is feasible to ensure consistent execution of reliable LRTs based dependencies."

However, an actual disassembly process of products has uncertainties since a variety of unpredictable factors. To handle such uncertainty, this work presents a novel disassembly modeling and planning approach using an extended stochastic Petri nets. An extended stochastic disassembly Petri nets (ESDPN) model is defined to provide basis for disassembly planning. Moreover, based on it, some typical probability evaluation models is built accordion to different disassembly criterion. In addition, a hybrid intelligent integrating stochastic simulation and neural network (NN) is proposed to solve the proposed models, respectively. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed models and the effectiveness of proposed algorithms."

Converted into the full-scale net by Tauti``s modeling rule and Kim``s modeling rule, when resistance coefficient k of each net was calculated by substituting into above equation for flow resistance  and wall area of nets  values of each net u. Because resistant coefficient k decreases exponentially according as flow velocity u increases to make k=cu-m C and m values of each net were and m values of each net were compared. As a result, as the model was smaller, c and m values was smaller in the two rule into standard of 1/10 model value, decrease degree of 1/25 model was almost same in the two rule, decrease degree of 1/50 model was very big in Tauti``s modeling rule.

First, in 1992-1994, korea took the armistice OPCON. Second, in 2006-2007, it was agreed that korea would take charge of the wartime OPCON beginning of April 17, 2012. Third, in 2010, the postponement of Wartime OPCON was occured. In 2013, korean ministration asked the U.S. to re-postpone the Wartime OPCON, first not in the U.S. side. It was confirmed through the 4 cases the above analysis, it is as follows. First, the change of the decision about the transfer of Wartime OPCON was affected by the threat and National power simultaneously. Second, the threat and the National power are affected by the regime of that time. Third, the variation of the perceived net-threat through taking the perceived threat and national power into account can make a decision between the security and the autonomy. Ultimately, it is necessary to consider the two elements of national power and threat. The change of OPCON will be possible to predict in advance through the concept of perceived net-threat."

For the first part of the study, it examines the current state and history of capital gains tax of real estate for Korea, Japan and U.S. The capital gains are legitimately included in the comprehensive income base since they represent additions to net worth. However, their measurement is not without problems. For one thing, individuals may not realize their capital gains in the same period in which they accrue. The capital gains accrue as the value of asset rises but these gains are only realized when the assets are converted into money through selling them. For many types of asset such as real estate, including accrued capital gains in the income base would involve valuing each individual’s holdings of asset periodically since market value may not be established. Capital gains are normally included as income only when realized. This causes many problems for long-term gains for more than a year: the bunching of long-term gains, the opportunities for timing the realization of gains and losses, and the lock-in effect of the tax on capital gains. Each country has treated these problems differently. This study suggests that capital gains should be included in the taxable income as the ordinary income(i. e., labor income, business income and investment income) in Korea. While capital gains on short-term assets shall be taxed at regular income tax rates, capital gains on long-term assets shall be taxed at the rates lower than regular income tax rates. In addition, this study provides suggestion that home sellers can claim exclusion of capital gains tax only if home meets the condition of owner-occupied housing irrespective of the numbers of owning houses. For the second part of the study, it examines the current state and history of tax on holding of real estate taxes for Korea, Japan and U.S. The property tax of real estate has been used mainly by local government because the local governments are better able to coordinate taxpayer with the benefits of public service financed by the tax in U.S. In mid-20th century, Japan and Korea introduced U.S. type local property tax of real property on benefit principle. However, in addition to local property tax, Japan and Korea adopted national property tax(Land Price Tax in Japan, Comprehensive Real Property Tax in Korea) to overcome the problem of sharp price rises of real estate. This study suggests that discrimination against the multi-home owner should be eliminated to determine the eligibility of Comprehensive Real Property Tax in Korea. Also, this study suggests that Korea should adopt a circuit breaker of property tax and special assessment used in U.S."
재무분석가 예측치의 라운딩현상과 예측정확성,2015,"['히핑', '라운딩', '재무분석가 예측치', '예측정확성', 'heaping', 'rounding', 'analyst forecasts', 'forecast accuracy']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Heaping is a specific form of response error typical to collected measure process and survey. Prior research has presented the phenomenon of heaping for analyst forecasts of annual earnings per share(EPS). And Herrmann and Thomas(2005) provide evidence that rounded forecasts are less accurate than other forecasts. In this paper we adopt a different and extended approach to Herrmann and Thomas(2005). Specifically, we have to take into account that Korean stock market can sometimes differ from U.S. stock market. And then we expand the prior research to analyst forecasts of operating income, net income, and sales. This study used 269,510 analyst forecasts collected from KOSPI over 2001 - 2012 period and empirically tested the relationship between heaping and forecast accuracy. The samples used in this study are retrieved from KIS-VALUE database and the forecast data are retrieved from Fn-DataGuidePro database. We observed the phenomenon of heaping for analyst forecasts of operating income, net income, and sales. And then we investigated the relationship between heaping and forecast accuracy. To examine the relationship, we used multiple regression method using the forecast accuracy as a dependent variable and rounding as a research variable . In addition, we include various control variables identified in prior studies. The selected control variables are characteristics of analysts and firms. The analysts characteristics are the previous absolute forecast error of analyst, the previous forecast error of analyst, the number of analysts employed by the broker employing analyst, the number of firm forecasts made by analyst, the number of years of firm-specific experience for analyst, the number of calendar days from the forecast date to the earnings announcement date, the number of firms followed by analyst, and the number of industries followed by analyst. And the firms characteristics are the market value of firm, debt ratio, return on assets, ratio of market value to book value of equity of firm, ratio of the largest shareholder, covariance of 1 year daily stock return, and standard deviation of 1 year daily stock return of firm. Also, Herrman and Thomas(2005) examines the correlation of stock returns with earnings forecast error to determine which forecasts have a stronger association with market expectations. We adopt this methodology to determine whether Korean capital market expectations better reflect a consensus including rounders or one excluding rounders. The results are consistent with our expectations. The main findings of the study are as follows. First, we find that EPS forecasts do not have heaping but analyst forecasts of operating income, net income, and sales occur in 10 intervals at a much greater frequency than actual operating income, net income, and sales. Second, rounded analyst forecasts of operating income, net income, and sales are associated with analyst``s forecast characteristics. Third, rounded analyst forecast of operating income, net income, and sales are less accurate and the negative relation between rounding and forecast accuracy respectively. And market participants showed a negative reaction to the consensus forecasts that includes rounding analysts of operating income, net income, and sales.

집합투자기구의 내부자거래 규제 - 미국의 뮤추얼펀드를 중심으로,2015,"['집합투자기구', '내부자거래', '뮤추얼펀드', '차익거래', '포트폴리오정보', '환매', '펀드주식', '신인의무이론', '부정유용이론', 'collective investment scheme', 'insider trading', 'mutual fund', 'arbitrage', 'portfolio information', 'redemption', 'fund share', 'fiduciary duty theory', 'misappropriation theory']","자본시장법상 내부자거래(Insider Trading)에 관한 규제규정은 1976년 12월 舊 증권거래법에서 도입한 이후 수차례의 개정을 거쳐 현행 자본시장법 제174조와 같은 틀을 갖추게 되었다. 본 논문에서는 우선적으로 자본시장법상 내부자거래에 관한 제174조의 해석론에 영향을 미치고 있는 1934년 증권거래법 제10조(b)와 SEC규칙 10b-5 등을 살펴본 후 집합투자기구(Collective Investment Scheme)의 일종인 뮤추얼펀드(Mutual Fund)의 내부자거래에 관한 법원의 태도 등을 분석하여 보았다. 그 결과, 미국의 법원은 1983년 Dirks 판결로 대표되는 신인의무이론(fiduciary duty theory)과 2008년 O’Hagan 판결로 대표되는 부정유용이론(misappropriation theory)을 내부자거래 규제에 관한 기초이론으로 전개하여 왔으나, 뮤추얼펀드(Mutual Fund)의 내부자거래에 대하여는 사업회사에게 적용되는 전통적인 이론을 적용하는데 소극적인 입장을 취하여 왔다는 점을 알 수 있었다. 특히 브로커와 뮤추얼펀드의 관계가 정보제공자와 정보수령자가 아닌 경우, 예를 들면 뮤추얼펀드에 관한 차익거래, 포트폴리오정보 및 환매정보(redemption information)를 이용한 매매를 하였을 때에는 이러한 입장이 더욱 명료하였다.뮤추얼펀드의 내부자거래에 대하여 미국의 법원이 소극적인 입장을 취하고 있는 주된 논거는 ① 뮤추얼펀드에 관한 정보를 이용하는 것만으로는 펀드가 발행한 주식을 대상으로 성공적인 내부자거래를 하는데 필요충분조건이 되지 못한다는 점, ② 펀드가 발행한 주식은 매 영업일 순자산가치로 가격을 산정하기 때문에 뮤추얼펀드의 주식의 거래는 오남용의 위험이 거의 없다는 점, ③ 뮤추얼펀드는 투자계획서와 각종 보고서에 환매의 순증 및 순자산의 하락 등과 같은 각종 정보를 포함하고 있고, 일반인들이 펀드의 내부사정을 펀드정보지 등 여러 매체를 통하여 잘 알 수 있다는 위치에 있다는 등으로 요약할 수 있다. 이러한 법원의 입장은 기술한 2014년 Heartland Fund 판례에서도 명확히 나타나고 있다.우리나라의 자본시장법상 내부자거래에 관한 제174조 및 2015년 7월부터 시행예정인 시장질서교란행위규제에 관한 제178조의2를 적용하여 집합투자기구에 관한 내부자거래를 규제함에 있어서는 미국 법원의 판결이 지향하는 바를 참조할 필요가 있다. 왜냐하면 현재 우리나라의 경우 집합투자기구의 일반적인 내부자거래에 관한 사례는 거의 없는 실정이고, 집합투자기구의 차익거래, 포트폴리오정보 또는 환매정보의 이용에 관한 사례는 전무하기 때문이다. 그리고 자본시장법의 규제를 받는 모든 금융투자업자를 일률적으로 동일한 이론을 가지고 규제를 하는 것은 필연적으로 과잉규제를 야기할 수 있는데, 이러한 문제점을 해결하기 위하여도 집합투자기구 및 그 발행증권에 관하여는 다른 법인체 및 그 발행증권에 관한 내부자거래 규제와는 다른 해석론이 전개되어야 할 것으로 보인다.","Regulation on Insider Trading for Collective Investment Schemes - Focusing on the Mutual Funds of the United States Oh, Sung-keun Since being incorporated into the former Securities Exchange Act in December, 1976, provisions regulating insider trading under the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act (hereinafter the “Capital Markets Act”) have undergone a number of revisions to establish the current framework under Article 174 of the Capital Markets Act. This article: (a) first discusses Article 10(b) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5, both of which seem to have affected the interpretation by market participants of Article 174 of the Capital Markets Act of Korea; and (b) examines the attitude of U.S. courts with regard to insider trading in mutual funds. Although U.S. courts have held that the fiduciary duty and misappropriation theories are valid bases for regulating insider trading, as represented respectively in the cases of Dirks (1983) and O’Hagan (1997), they have been quite reluctant to apply these traditional theories to cases involving insider trading in mutual funds. Such position was even more pronounced in cases where the broker is not in an informant-recipient relationship with a mutual fund, for instance when the broker traded based on mutual fund arbitrage, portfolio information, or redemption information.The rationale behind U.S. courts’ passive approach is their observation that: (a) access to insider information on a mutual fund’s holdings by itself is insufficient to ensure successful insider trades of shares issued by the fund; (b) the fact that by law a mutual fund’s share price is determined by the fund’s net asset value per share each business day makes it quite difficult for anyone to profit from trading mutual fund shares on insider information; and (c) the public is in a position to gain considerable knowledge of a mutual fund’s operation by their access to key information on a mutual fund’s holdings, such as net redemptions and decrease in net asset value, through the fund’s prospectus and reports, as well as numerous investor magazines and newsletters covering such funds. Such stance taken by U.S. courts is reaffirmed in the recent Heartland Fund case (2014).In regulating insider trading by applying Article 174, on insider trading, and Article 178(2), on prohibition of activities likely to cause fluctuation in the marketplace, to cases involving insider trading in collective investment schemes, Korean courts may well take account of the aspirations demonstrated in U.S. court precedents. The reason is that in Korea, there has scarcely been any filing of a lawsuit involving conventional insider trading in a collective investment scheme, nor any case reported thus far involving arbitrage activities of a collective investment scheme, use of confidential information of portfolio holdings, or inside information on redemption of a collective scheme. Subjecting all financial investment companies to a “one size fits all” approach under the Capital Markets Act may inevitably lead to over-regulation. To address such a problem, it is necessary to advance an interpretive theory with regard to collective investment schemes and their securities, as distinct from that applicable to regulation of insider trading in other types of corporations and their securities."

The simulation based on the actual tax system of each country for its median income household shows that the net return on pension is smaller in Korea than that of the United States and the United Kingdom, when their fund is invested in the stock market. Korea provides tax incentives on corporate pension when collecting premium, but not when accumulating funds, as it is not considered to be capital gains on stocks. On the other hand, most other countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, give tax incentives on capital gains on stock, invested through corporate pension fund. This paper shows that under the current system, there is no tax benefits from investing in stocks, compared to investing in fixed income products. This may lead the workers to under-investment in corporate pension, than those in other countries. The rapid population aging increases the need for programs that guarantee retirement income. Therefore, the establishment of corporate pension, as well as the national pension, system is urgent. Capital gains and pension-related income tax reform can help retired workers to receive enough pension. In additional, I simulate the effective tax benefits across different income groups. The income group with the highest marginal tax rate receives six time higher tax benefit compared to that with the lowest marginal tax rate."

Analysis of Association between Norepinephrine Transporter Gene Polymorphisms and Personality Traits of NEO-FFI in a Japanese Population,2015,"['Norepinephrine transporter', 'Gene polymorphism', 'NEO-FFI', 'Personality']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"ObjectiveaaNorepinephrine is an important chemical messenger that is involved in mood and stress in humans, and is reabsorbed by the norepinephrine transporter (NET). According to Cloninger’s theory, the noradrenergic system mediates the personality trait of reward dependence. Thus far, although association studies on NET gene polymorphisms and Cloninger’s personality traits have been reported, they yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, in the present study we investigated whether or not the 1287G/A, -182T/C and -3081A/T polymorphisms of the NET gene (SLC6A2) are associated with reward dependence-related traits, as assessed by the five-factor model.MethodsaaAfter written informed consent was obtained from participants, the three NET gene polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and personality was assessed by the Neuroticism Extraversion Openness-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) in 270 Japanese university students.ResultsaaA significant relation was found between the -3081A/T functional promoter polymorphism and NEO-FFI scores: those with the T allele exhibited a lower extraversion (E) score than those without the T allele (Mann-Whitney U-test: z=-3.861, p<0.001). However, there was no correlation between the other NET gene polymorphisms and E score, and no association with other dimensions and these three polymorphisms.ConclusionaaWe conclude that the -3081A/T functional polymorphism in the NET gene may affect the extraversion of reward dependence- related traits, as measured by NEO-FFI. However, we used only the shortened version of NEO-PI-R in this study. Further investigations are necessary using the full version of self-rating personality questionnaires."

Under this circumstance, the Community Currency is the movement proposed as one of the alternative development models to create a society or community voluntarily and through this, raise the sense of belonging, happiness and self-esteem and form a new life. The Community Currency is a new local community movement mainly experimented in the UK, Australia, the U.S. and Canada and it is also implemented in over 2,000 countries of Europe, South America, and Asia. As part of the efforts to organize the trading of labor services and products with the medium of virtual community currency, the Community Currency Movement tries to systematize the structure to give and take the goods and services without involving any money among the members. Given that the Community Currency Movement has an enough room to approach from the complementary perspectives on the development of regional society and the formation of local community, it is to suggest a new type of community currency keeping up with the times. The model for this study can be defined as part of a regional society welfare project based on the community currency. Using the latest IT technology, this model secures the goods and services within the region by combining the community currency model, cooperative association and civic group, and prepare the social virtuous cycle through arranging the wealth produced in this process as a welfare fund of the community.

This article tries to answer this question by reconsidering secularization from the perspective of the sociology of religion, borrowing Habermas’ concepts of legitimacy crisis and post-secular society and reflecting on theological issues in the light of the Second Vatican Council.First, the sociological theory of secularization, reflecting on the Church’s legitimacy and crisis in Western European societies, constitutes institutional differentiation, cosmic-symbolic invalidity of religion, and the privatization of religion as the relevance of religion has weakened for modern individuals’ life-worlds. It is consequently related to ‘declining religious authority’. In particular, the Church crisis in Europe and the U.S. includes individual priests’ immorality (i.e., pedophilia), a lack of institu-tional accountability and organizational responsibility on the part of the Church, and social distrust of the Church. However, the Church crisis as social phenomena needs to be understood in the post-secular social con-text in which religion has not lost its power in the public sphere and the religious and the secular are in conflict. The primary task of the Church is to bear witness to the ‘fullness of life’ or ‘happiness’ in the immanent frame.Symptoms of the legitimacy crisis in the Korean Catholic Church can be found in both institutional churches and clericalism. On the one hand, some institutional churches reveal CEO styles of secular triumphalism based on ‘spiritual worldliness’. The bureaucratic governance of the Church appears to be of the ancien régime, not of the current society of information and networks in which people aspire toward de-authoritarian, horizontal communication. On the other hand, the problems of clericalism include the human immaturity of church leadership, the lack of authen-ticity and spiritual sensibilities in priesthood, the patriarchal culture of gender inequality, and the lack of collaborative, caring communities/net-works among clergy and the religious.This article suggests multi-dimensional conversion as pastoral alterna-tives in response to the problem of the Church crisis. Church leaders (bishops, priests, religious, and lay) need to recover ‘inner authority’ through sincerity and authenticity at an individual level. ‘Companionship of empowerment’ as an antidote to clericalism can help the Church to bear witness to the Heavenly Kingdom at a communal/organizational level. Prophetic commitment requires liminality from the center to the periphery at a social level. Finally and most importantly, the Church needs to put its initiatives into the hands of God following the guidance of the Holy Spirit."
Does Conditional Conservatism Affect Credit Ratings?: An Analysis Of Korean KRX Bond Issuers,2015,"['조건부 보수주의', '신용등급', 'Basu 모형', 'Ball and Shivakumar 모형', '투자등급', 'Conditional Conservatism', 'Credit Ratings', 'Basu Model', 'Ball and Shivakumar Model', 'Investment Grade']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We examine whether there is a relationship between conditional conservatism and credit ratings. Credit rating levels are the ‘opinion‘ of credit rating agencies about a firm’s default risk based on financial statements data and corporate governance information. In South Korea, credit rating levels are issued by National Information & Credit Evaluation (NICE), Korea Investor Services (KIS), Korea Ratings (KR) and Seoul Credit Rating & Information (SCI), and are used by bond investors, debt issuers, and governmental officials for decision making and legislative purposes. Accounting practices such as conditional conservatism have the potential to signal low default risk and financial stability. Accounting conservatism reflects a manager’s tendency to recognize “bad news” in a timelier manner than “good news” (Basu, 1997). The academic community continues to debate the merits of conservatism. However, the majority of studies suggest that conditional conservatism is an accounting practice with the potential to increase accounting quality (Watts, 2003; Roychowdhury and Watts, 2007; Ball and Kothari, 2008). In the U. S., numerous studies find an association between level of conservatism and credit ratings (Ahmed et al., 2002; Moerman (2006); Nikolaev (2007); Bauwhede (2007): Zhang, 2008; Peek 2010). Therefore, in the U.S., there is evidence to suggest that credit ratings agencies care about conditional conservatism as an accounting practice with the potential to influence default risk.In South Korea, there is evidence of a positive relation between accounting conservatism levels and credit ratings (Park et al., 2011). However, the association between credit rating changes and financial conservatism is a question left unanswered. Our motivation is to address this caveat. To our knowledge, our study is the first to analyze the association between conditional conservatism and credit ratings and credit rating changes using the two most popular conditional conservatism measures. We contribute to the literature by providing an evidence that conditional conservatism may influence a credit rating agency’s perception of default risk.We  examine if conditional conservatism is associated with credit ratings based on the following; conditional conservatism is an accounting practice associated with reducing a manager‘s ability to 'inflate' net income; hence, constraining dividend has the potential to reduce a credit rating agency’s perception of  risk.  Credit rating agencies issue higher credit ratings to firms with lower default risk. Thus, because firms care deeply about maintaining or increasing their credit ratings,  conservative reporting should have a positive a relation with credit rating levels / credit ratings changes. We perform numerous tests to establish the relation between conditional conservatism and credit ratings / credit rating changes. We investigate the relationship between a firm's credit ratings / credit ratings changes and conditional conservatism using a KRX firm sample of 1,310 firm-years from 2002 to 2013. First, we establish the levels of conditional conservatism using the accruals based Ball and Shivakumar (2005) and the market based Basu (1997) models. The results suggest that firms borrow equity in the form of public debt are conservative, consistent with previous studies.  Next, we use a dummy variable approach to examine the relationship between conservatism and credit ratings for investment / non-investment grade firms.  We find that investment and non-investment grade firms have statistically insignificantly different levels of financial conservatism.Thirdly, we test if conditional conservatism has a statistically significant relation with credit rating changes. We find that firms that experience an increase or a decrease in their credit rating levels from period t to t+1 are marginally more conservative compared to firms with consistent credit rating levels. Next, we test the rel..."

If we want to bring down unemployment and to increase economic growth rate, we need to create new companies and to make them to grow. Credit availability is one of the most important factors for entrepreneurs as they attempt to start or expand a business. For young firms, access to credit for business growth can mean the difference between survival and failure. Equity crowdfunding is an innovative means of raising capital for businesses. Crowdfunding campaigns can give new business access to a large pool of investors. This brings huge benefits for marketing and increase provability of success of business and ROI, so it leads follow-on investment from Venture Capital and Angel investors. In Korea, the survival rate of startups and average growth rate of survivors is far lower than those of the U.S or other countries due to lack of funds for startup or early business growth. Equity crowdfunding can be a new funding source for venture or startups. It can increase startup and survival rate, in addition to the growth rate of survivors, resulting in decreased unemployment rate. In Korea, Equity crowdfunding will be available from 2016. Further study is needed to determine whether the impact of crowdfunding in Korea on job creation will be similar to its impact in the U.S."

Accordingly, various smart devices, such as a smart phone, Tablet PC is utilized in the medical information system. Also, these environments consist of various applications executing on heterogeneous sensors, devices, systems and networks. In these hospital information system environment, applying a security service by traditional access control method cause a problems. Most of the existing security system uses the access control list structure. It is only permitted access defined by an access control matrix such as client name, service object method name. The major problem with the static approach cannot quickly adapt to changed situations. Hence, we needs to new security mechanisms which provides more flexible and can be easily adapted to various environments with very different security requirements. In addition, for addressing the changing of service medical treatment of the patient, the researching is needed. In this paper, we suggest a dynamic approach to medical information systems in smart mobile environments. We focus on how to access medical information systems according to dynamic access control methods based on the existence of the hospital`s information system environments. The physical environments consist of a mobile x-ray imaging devices, dedicated mobile/general smart devices, PACS, EMR server and authorization server. The software environment was developed based on the .Net Framework for synchronization and monitoring services based on mobile X-ray imaging equipment Windows7 OS. And dedicated a smart device application, we implemented a dynamic access services through JSP and Java SDK is based on the Android OS. PACS and mobile X-ray image devices in hospital, medical information between the dedicated smart devices are based on the DICOM medical image standard information. In addition, EMR information is based on H7. In order to providing dynamic access control service, we classify the context of the patients according to conditions of bio-information such as oxygen saturation, heart rate, BP and body temperature etc. It shows event trace diagrams which divided into two parts like general situation, emergency situation. And, we designed the dynamic approach of the medical care information by authentication method. The authentication Information are contained ID/PWD, the roles, position and working hours, emergency certification codes for emergency patients. General situations of dynamic access control method may have access to medical information by the value of the authentication information. In the case of an emergency, was to have access to medical information by an emergency code, without the authentication information. And, we constructed the medical information integration database scheme that is consist medical information, patient, medical staff and medical image information according to medical information standards.y Finally, we show the usefulness of the dynamic access application service based on the smart devices for execution results of the proposed system according to patient contexts such as general and emergency situation. Especially, the proposed systems are providing effective medical information services with smart devices in emergency situation by dynamic access control methods. As results, we expect the proposed systems to be useful for u-hospital information systems and services."

Derivatives are traded by 26.22% of equity funds in our sample, which consists of all equity funds in Korea for 12 years between 2002 and 2013. We find that fund age and sales fee are key factors to determine the use of derivatives by equity funds. Our results show that equity funds with a higher sales fee and a higher age are more likely to utilize derivatives. We adopt various risk measures (e.g., the standard deviation of stock returns, market beta, idiosyncratic risk, downside beta, skewness, and kurtosis) to strengthen the robustness of our results. As a result, we find that derivative users present significantly lower levels of risk than non-users after controlling for firms’ characteristics, suggesting that the main purpose of derivatives use is to reduce fund risk. However, derivative users do not exhibit significantly higher performance after controlling for net asset values, sales fees, and other control variables. To quantify fund performance accurately, we construct performance measures including the average excess return, the Sharpe ratio, the alphas calculated by several asset pricing models (e.g., the market model, the Fama-French 3 factor model, the Treynor and Mazuy (1966) model, and the Henriksson and Merton (1981) model). Our findings are consistent with Chen (2011) based on hedge funds in the U.S. and not consistent with Koski and Pontiff (1999) based on mutual funds. We further study the effect of derivative trading on fund risk before and after the 2008 financial crisis and confirm that the use of derivatives has a significant impact on the level of fund risk only after the crisis. Accordingly, our findings imply that professional fund managers start to manage the level of risk using derivatives after experiencing the crisis."

Supreme Court Decision 2012Du11836, dated June 26, 2014, held that if a U.S. entity was fiscally transparent for the purpose of taxation in U.S., it was entitled to tax benefits under the Korea-U.S. tax treaty as a resident only to the extent its members were subject to U.S. tax, even though the entity itself was treated as a foreign corporation under Korean tax law. The Supreme Court is known to maintain a view that is different from the entity classification stated in the OECD Partnership Report, but as shown in the recent decision, the Supreme Court’s analysis reaches the same outcome as that in the OECD Partnership Report.  In Supreme Court Decision 2012Du18356, dated November 27, 2014, the Supreme Court concluded that the royalty paid for the use of patents from a Korean company to a U.S. corporation was not Korean source income in the context of the Korea-U.S. tax treaty, if the patent had not been registered in Korea. However, the author disagrees with the conclusion, because this decision disregards Article 93 (9) of the Corporation Income Tax Law, newly inserted in December 26, 2008, establishing the place of source rule for royalty income.  Supreme Court Decision 2012Du1747, 1757, dated September 4, 2014 and 2012Du23341, dated August 20, 2014, ruled that NTS had the burden to prove that the arm’s length price was calculated reasonably following the transactional net margin method. This decision appears to maintain the position held by previous decisions that the burden of proof for showing the tax assessment’s legality lays upon the NTS.  Supreme Court Decision 2012Du16466, dated July 10, 2014, is in accordance with the precedent decisions that substance-over-form doctrine can be applied in the interpretation of a tax treaty. Also, this decision points out some significant factors when applying substance-over-form doctrine. For example, a parent company which owns the entire shares of its subsidiary can control the subsidiary’s business management or decision making as a shareholder, but this does not directly mean that the parent is a substantial owner of the subsidiary’s income only for that reason, and the nature of holding company should be considered when applying the doctrine.  Seoul High Court Decision 2013Nu534026, dated May 28, 2014, ruled that a taxpayer is eligible for tax sparing credit if he/she was exempted from dividend income tax in China based on the differential limited tax rate of Korea-China tax treaty. However, this conclusion is questionable, because the purpose and intent of tax sparing credit and differential limited tax rate system are wholly different. Regarding this issue, further Supreme Court decisions may be necessary to clarify the problem."

Furthermore, such top management’s tone about corporate culture or risk tolerance are also most effectively implemented into a firm``s business strategy. Accordingly, it might be inferred that there is some association between a firm``s business strategy and its tax strategy. While many studies are investigating what can more explain reasons or motivations for tax avoidance, a firm’s business strategy may provide the approach which is more comprehensive and generalizable across industries than those specific individual variables previously considered for tax avoidance. The business strategy provides a theoretical background for an even broader understanding of the factors that are ex ante determinants of tax avoidance level. Ittner et al. (1997), Higgins et al. (2015) and Bentley et al. (2013) are main prior accounting researches that used a comprehensive and composite measure of business strategy as an explanatory variables. Such prior research are all based on Miles and Snow(1978, 2003)’s strategy theory. According to the Miles and Snow(1978, 2003), prospectors focus on innovation, pursue new products and geographic markets and are more likely to be aggressive, which have relatively more tax planning opportunities. Further, given that their products tend not to have readily available substitutes, prospectors are less concerned about negative publicity arising from tax avoidance. By contrast, defenders focus on comparatively sound, stable and predictable areas and put the stress on the economy of scale. defenders`` aversion to risk and uncertainty also suggests that given the set of tax opportunities available, they would avoid tax less aggressively. Since their products have viable substitutes, defenders could incur reputation costs associated with tax avoidance. Using the Miles and Snow(1978, 2003) theoretical business strategy framework, this study examines the relation between the aggressiveness of a firm’s business strategy and tax avoidance level for the Korean listed companies. We first investigate whether a firm’s business strategy aggressiveness is associated with its level of tax avoidance and predict that firms close to prospector engage in more tax aggressive behaviors than those close to defender(Hypothesis 1). Next, we investigate the association between a firm’s business strategy aggressiveness and volatility of firms’ tax avoidance and predict that the firms close to prospector have more volatility in their measures of tax avoidance than those close to defender(Hypothesis 2). We finally investigate the fact that a firm is a small and medium-sized enterprise under the Korean law affect the association between business strategy and the level of tax avoidance. To address our research questions, we used four alternative tax avoidance measures (the book and cash effective tax rate, BTD and DD BTD. We also compute a discrete STRATEGY composite index measure(STRATEGY_INDEX), which proxies for a firm’s business strategy aggressiveness. This measure is based on variables from prior literature (e.g., Ittner et al. 1997; Bentley, et al. 2013 and Higgins et al. 2015) that reflect different facets of this strategy: (1) the ratio of research and development to sales, (2) the ratio of employees to sales, (3) a growth opportunity measure (market-to-book ratio), (4) the ratio of marketing (SG&A) to sales, (5) employee fluctuations (standard deviation of total employees), and (6) capital intensity (net PPE scaled by total assets). Each of the six measures is intended to capture different elements of a firm’s business strategy. We find from the test of Hypothesis 1 that four (4) measures of tax avoidance level have positive (+) associations with the business strategy aggressiveness, which is consistent with our prediction. From the test of Hypothesis 2, we also find that the association between a firm’s business strategy aggressiveness and volatility of firms’ tax avoidance is positive (+) for all measures, provided that statistical significance is found only for two tax avoidance measures(BOOK_ETR and CASH_ETR). The test of Hypothesis 3 indicates that a small and medium-sized enterprise(SME) reduces the positive (+) the association between the business strategy aggressiveness and tax avoidance level. The results above suggest that a firm with aggressive business strategy engages in more aggressive tax avoidance activities since it pursues new product and new geographic markets entailing more tax avoidance planning opportunities. However, such aggressive tax avoidance activities are comparatively weaker in small and medium-sized firms than large firms even if they are pursuing aggressive business strategy. Our study is distinct from the prior tax literature (i.e., Higgins et al. 2015) in several ways: First, we separate SMEs from non-SMEs at the same level of business strategy, and we found that the level of tax avoidance of SMEs is lower than that of non-SMEs. Second, this study is for the Korean firms which are affected by the Korean specific management system and tax regime that are different from those of U.S. This study considered the Korean specific situations (e.g., 2009 is excluded from the sample due to the external shock (i.e., international financial crisis) and other control variables such as operating cash flow(OCFS), management ownership(MOWN) and foreign investor‘s shareholding(FSH) and SMEs(SMS) which are associated with tax avoidance under prior Korean researches. Third, we conducted both one (1) dummy regression model using samples of only prospector and defender group and the continuous variable model rather than 2-dummies regression model used by Higgins et al. (2015). Fourth, we conducted a robust test to investigate whether 6 facets composing the strategy are endogenously related with the tax avoidance level and factor analysis to test whether our strategy index is much stronger than the common factor. This research is important because it helps provide a better understanding of the factors that affect a firm’s propensity to engage in aggressive tax avoidance behavior. The distinguishing feature of our study is that it is grounded in a theoretical framework that is used to make clear predictions regarding the link between the aggressiveness of a firm’s business strategy and its tax aggressiveness."

To receive a tax benefit of the IRC, and private foundations will be approved by submitting Form 1023 within 27 months after the end of the legally established by the IRS, a tax report shall submit annually using Form 990-PF. This study reports the tax Form 990-PF organizations that summit the report of 2013 US 695 scholarship foundation of samples were analyzed financial characteristics.  First, We analyzed amount and ratio of revenue, expense, and asset of samples. Income ratio calculated by total revenue deduct total expense accounted for 34.22% when we assumed that total revenue is 100%. The proportion of on disposal of items of income accounted for 65.59%. The investment assets of total asset, the source for the spending of donations and grants, accounted for 92.79%. in particular, it was analyzed that the acquisition of dividend income through stock, accounting for 52.5%.  Second, we classified our samples into to groups. One is for calculating the number of firms by total revenue minus total expense and the other is for calculating the number of firms using distributable amount deduct qualifying distribution amount. Firms (316 of samples) that total revenue deducting total expense was positive value recorded income in 2013. Firms (379 of samples) with negative value recorded loss in 2013. Moreover, firms with positive value of distributable amount deducting qualifying distribution amount, then firms under-distributed their expense through the year. Firms with negative value means over-distributed their expense through the year. Our results the number of under-distributed firms was 351, and over-distributed firms was 344. Among the total samples, firms with over-distributing and net loss accounted for 220 (31.65% of the samples) means they operated organizations in the foremost ways under the difficult financial situation.  Last, It is the first analysis of financial characteristics using USA Form 990-PF. Considering Increasing the interest of non-profit organization in Korea, It has political implications to amend related policy. We expect that it gives a ground on policy of scholarship by looking U.S. cases.  With establishing sound financial structure and diversifying revenue structure, scholarship foundations can be encouraged to do more their scholarship businesses.  This study is based on the example of the United States. It may be contributed to the problem exists in the national scholarship fund requiring a more transparent and proactive in seeking ways to take advantage of the operational aspects in Korea.  The sample size of our study constraint as well as limitation of availability and data collection exist. Therefore, it is considered that future research required in the more leverage the research methodological approach of the other side with a lot of samples."

The panel analysis results show that organizational resources, characteristics and environments may affect the financial indicators measured by a firm’s net income(profitability indicators) and sales(activity and productivity indicators). More specifically, as organizational resources (‘flow’ variable), business expenses share of the whole budget was positively significant, while labor cost share of the whole budget was negatively significant. A firm's financial status such as debt－to－equity ratio (‘stock’ variable) had the inversed－U relationship with the financial performance. Regarding environmental factors, fiscal self－reliance ratio of local governments of local public enterprises had a significantly positive effect on a firm’s performance, while debt－to－budget ratio showed the inversed－U shape curve with the performance."
