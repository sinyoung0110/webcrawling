Detection of Cardiovascular Disease Risk’s Level for Adults Using Naive Bayes Classifier,2016,"['Data Mining', 'Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Bayes Theorem']",,"Objectives: The number of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease and stroke is predicted to reach 23.3 million in 2030. As a contribution to support prevention of this phenomenon, this paper proposes a mining model using a naïve Bayes classifier that could detect cardiovascular disease and identify its risk level for adults. Methods: The process of designing the method began by identifying the knowledge related to the cardiovascular disease profile and the level of cardiovascular disease risk factors for adults based on the medical record, and designing a mining technique model using a naïve Bayes classifier. Evaluation of this research employed two methods: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity calculation as well as an evaluation session with cardiologists and internists. The characteristics of cardiovascular disease are identified by its primary risk factors. Those factors are diabetes mellitus, the level of lipids in the blood, coronary artery function, and kidney function. Class labels were assigned according to the values of these factors: risk level 1, risk level 2 and risk level 3. Results: The evaluation of the classifier performance (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) in this research showed that the proposed model predicted the class label of tuples correctly (above 80%). More than eighty percent of respondents (including cardiologists and internists) who participated in the evaluation session agree till strongly agreed that this research followed medical procedures and that the result can support medical analysis related to cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: The research showed that the proposed model achieves good performance for risk level detection of cardiovascular disease."
클래스 불균형 데이터를 이용한 나이브 베이즈 분류기 기반의 이상전파에코 식별방법,2016,,,"Anomalous propagation echo is a kind of abnormal radar signal occurred by irregularly refracted radar beam caused by temperature or humidity. The echo frequently appears in ground-based weather radar due to its observation principle and disturb weather forecasting process. In order to improve accuracy of weather forecasting, it is important to analyze radar data precisely. Therefore, there are several ongoing researches about identifying the anomalous propagation echo with data mining techniques. This paper conducts researches about implementation of classification method which can separate the anomalous propagation echo in the raw radar data using naive Bayes classifier with various kinds of observation results. Considering that collected data has a class imbalanced problem, this paper includes SMOTE method. It is confirmed that the fine classification results are derived by the suggested classifier with balanced dataset using actual appearance cases of the echo."
Intelligent Traffic Prediction by Multi-sensor Fusion using Multi-threaded Machine Learning,2016,"['Intelligent transportation system', 'K-nearest neighbor', 'Naive bayes']",,"Estimation and analysis of traffic jams plays a vital role in an intelligent transportation system and advances safety in the transportation system as well as mobility and optimization of environmental impact. For these reasons, many researchers currently mainly focus on the brilliant machine learning-based prediction approaches for traffic prediction systems. This paper primarily addresses the analysis and comparison of prediction accuracy between two machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). Based on the fact that optimized estimation accuracy of these methods mainly depends on a large amount of recounted data and that they require much time to compute the same function heuristically for each action, we propose an approach that applies multi-threading to these heuristic methods. It is obvious that the greater the amount of historical data, the more processing time is necessary. For a real-time system, operational response time is vital, and the proposed system also focuses on the time complexity cost as well as computational complexity. It is experimentally confirmed that K-NN does much better than Naïve Bayes, not only in prediction accuracy but also in processing time. Multithreading- based K-NN could compute four times faster than classical K-NN, whereas multithreading - based Naïve Bayes could process only twice as fast as classical Bayes."

These days, it occurs often that such private or individual information is leaked. In principle, all Android applications are composed of user defined methods and APIs. As well as accessing to resources on platform, APIs play a role as a practical functional feature, and user defined methods play a role as a feature by using APIs. In this paper we propose a scheme to analyze sensitive APIs mostly used in malicious applications in terms of how malicious applications operate and which API they use. Based on the characteristics of target APIs, we accumulate the knowledge on such APIs using a machine learning scheme based on Naive Bayes algorithm. Resulting from the learned results, we are able to provide fine-grained numeric score on the degree of vulnerabilities of mobile applications. In doing so, we expect the proposed scheme will help mobile application developers identify the security level of applications in advance."

From 2011 to 2014, with the sentiment analysis, Twitter who had commented ‘KMA’ had collected, then, using Naïve Bayes classification, we were classified into three sentiments: positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. An additional dictionary was made with morphemes appeared only in the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments of basic Naïve Bayes classification, thus the accuracy of sentiment analysis was improved. As a result, when sentiments were classified with a basic Naïve Bayes classification, the training data were reproduced about 75% accuracy rate. Whereas, when classifying with the additional dictionary, it showed 97% accuracy rate. When using the additional dictionary, sentiments of verification data was classified with about 75% accuracy rate. Lower classification accuracy rate would be improved by not only a qualified dictionary that has increased amount of training data, including diverse keywords related to weather, but continuous update of the dictionary. Meanwhile, contrary to the sentiment analysis based on dictionary definition of individual vocabulary, if sentiments are classified into meaning of sentence, increased rate of negative sentiment and change in satisfaction could be explained. Therefore, the sentiment analysis via SNS would be considered as useful tool for complementing surveys in the future."

다양한 기계학습 기법의 암상예측 적용성 비교 분석,2016,"['Secondary information', 'Well-logging', 'Subsurface prediction', 'Machine learning']",,"In the present study, we applied various machine learning techniques comparatively for prediction of subsurface structures based on multiple secondary information (i.e., well-logging data). The machine learning techniques employed in this study are Naive Bayes classification (NB), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression classification (LR). As an alternative model, conventional hidden Markov model (HMM) and modified hidden Markov model (mHMM) are used where additional information of transition probability between primary properties is incorporated in the predictions. In the comparisons, 16 boreholes consisted with four different materials are synthesized, which show directional non-stationarity in upward and downward directions. Futhermore, two types of the secondary information that is statistically related to each material are generated. From the comparative analysis with various case studies, the accuracies of the techniques become degenerated with inclusion of additive errors and small amount of the training data. For HMM predictions, the conventional HMM shows the similar accuracies with the models that does not relies on transition probability. However, the mHMM consistently shows the highest prediction accuracy among the test cases, which can be attributed to the consideration of geological nature in the training of the model."
SVM을 이용한 VKOSPI 일 중 변화 예측과 실제 옵션 매매에의 적용,2016,"['기계학습', 'SVM', '옵션 매매', 'Machine Learning', 'Support Vector Machine', 'VKOSPI', 'Option Trading']",,"Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence. It refers to an area of computer science related to providing machines the ability to perform their own data analysis, decision making and forecasting. For example, one of the representative machine learning models is artificial neural network, which is a statistical learning algorithm inspired by the neural network structure of biology. In addition, there are other machine learning models such as decision tree model, naive bayes model and SVM(support vector machine) model. Among the machine learning models, we use SVM model in this study because it is mainly used for classification and regression analysis that fits well to our study. The core principle of SVM is to find a reasonable hyperplane that distinguishes different group in the data space. Given information about the data in any two groups, the SVM model judges to which group the new data belongs based on the hyperplane obtained from the given data set. Thus, the more the amount of meaningful data, the better the machine learning ability.  In recent years, many financial experts have focused on machine learning, seeing the possibility of combining with machine learning and the financial field where vast amounts of financial data exist. Machine learning techniques have been proved to be powerful in describing the non-stationary and chaotic stock price dynamics. A lot of researches have been successfully conducted on forecasting of stock prices using machine learning algorithms. Recently, financial companies have begun to provide Robo-Advisor service, a compound word of Robot and Advisor, which can perform various financial tasks through advanced algorithms using rapidly changing huge amount of data. Robo-Advisers main task is to advise the investors about the investors personal investment propensity and to provide the service to manage the portfolio automatically.  In this study, we propose a method of forecasting the Korean volatility index, VKOSPI, using the SVM model, which is one of the machine learning methods, and applying it to real option trading to increase the trading performance. VKOSPI is a measure of the future volatility of the KOSPI 200 index based on KOSPI 200 index option prices. VKOSPI is similar to the VIX index, which is based on S&P 500 option price in the United States. The Korea Exchange(KRX) calculates and announce the real-time VKOSPI index. VKOSPI is the same as the usual volatility and affects the option prices. The direction of VKOSPI and option prices show positive relation regardless of the option type (call and put options with various striking prices). If the volatility increases, all of the call and put option premium increases because the probability of the options exercise possibility increases. The investor can know the rising value of the option price with respect to the volatility rising value in real time through Vega, a Black-Scholess measurement index of an options sensitivity to changes in the volatility. Therefore, accurate forecasting of VKOSPI movements is one of the important factors that can generate profit in option trading.  In this study, we verified through real option data that the accurate forecast of VKOSPI is able to make a big profit in real option trading. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies on the idea of predicting the direction of VKOSPI based on machine learning and introducing the idea of applying it to actual option trading.  In this study predicted daily VKOSPI changes through SVM model and then made intraday option strangle position, which gives profit as option prices reduce, only when VKOSPI is expected to decline during daytime. We analyzed the results and tested whether it is applicable to real option trading based on SVMs prediction. The results showed the prediction accuracy of VKOSPI was 57.83% on average, and the number of position entry times was 43.2 times, which is less than half of the benchma"
Model-induced term-weighting schemes for text classification,2016,,,"<P>The bag-of-words representation of text data is very popular for document classification. In the recent literature, it has been shown that properly weighting the term feature vector can improve the classification performance significantly beyond the original term-frequency based features. In this paper we demystify the success of the recent term-weighting strategies as well as provide possibly more reasonable modifications. We then propose novel term-weighting schemes that can be induced from the well-known document probabilistic models such as the Naive Bayes and the multinomial term model. Interestingly, some of the intuition-based term-weighting schemes coincide exactly with the proposed derivations. Our term-weighting schemes are tested on large-scale text classification problems/datasets where we demonstrate improved prediction performance over existing approaches.</P>"
Boosted NNE collections for multicultural facial expression recognition,2016,"['Ensemble classifier', 'Neural network ensemble collections', 'Facial expression recognition', 'Binary neural network']",,"In this paper, a boosted NNE (neural network ensemble) collections based technique for multicultural facial expression recognition is presented. The boosted NNE collections based ensemble classifier involves three steps: first is the training of binary neural networks, second is to combine the predictions of binary neural networks to form NNE, and third is to combine the predictions of NNE collections in order to detect the presence of an expression. The results of binary neural networks are tied to the probability value across the NNE collection. The boosting technique is applied for the construction of NNEs and the final prediction is made by Naive Bayes classifier. The Voila-Jones algorithm [1] employed for the detection of face and facial expression concentration region. The acted still images from three databases JAFFE, TFEID, and RadBoud originate from four different cultural and ethnic regions including Japanese, Taiwanese, Caucasians and Moroccans are combined to develop the cross cultural facial expression dataset. This cross cultural facial expression dataset is used for the training and testing of binary neural networks in each NNE collection. Three different feature extraction techniques PCA, LBP and HOG are used for sample image representation. The experimental results and statistical analysis of proposed approach for multicultural facial expression recognition constitute the contribution to the field."
영화 리뷰 감성분석을 위한 텍스트 마이닝 기반 감성 분류기 구축,2016,"['감성 분석', '감성 분류', '영화 리뷰 분석', 'sentiment analysis', 'sentiment classification', 'movie review analysis', 'text mining']",,"Sentiment analysis is used for identifying emotions or sentiments embedded in the user generated data such as customer reviews from blogs, social network services, and so on. Various research fields such as computer science and business management can take advantage of this feature to analyze customer-generated opinions.  In previous studies, the star rating of a review is regarded as the same as sentiment embedded in the text. However, it does not always correspond to the sentiment polarity. Due to this supposition, previous studies have some limitations in their accuracy. To solve this issue, the present study uses a supervised sentiment classification model to measure a more accurate sentiment polarity. This study aims to propose an advanced sentiment classifier and to discover the correlation between movie reviews and box-office success.  The advanced sentiment classifier is based on two supervised machine learning techniques, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Feedforward Neural Network (FNN). The sentiment scores of the movie reviews are measured by the sentiment classifier and are analyzed by statistical correlations between movie reviews and box-office success. Movie reviews are collected along with a star-rate. The dataset used in this study consists of 1,258,538 reviews from 175 films gathered from Naver Movie website (movie.naver.com).  The results show that the proposed sentiment classifier outperforms Naive Bayes (NB) classifier as its accuracy is about 6% higher than NB. Furthermore, the results indicate that there are positive correlations between the star-rate and the number of audiences, which can be regarded as the box-office success of a movie. The study also shows that there is the mild, positive correlation between the sentiment scores estimated by the classifier and the number of audiences. To verify the applicability of the sentiment scores, an independent sample t-test was conducted. For this, the movies were divided into two groups using the average of sentiment scores. The two groups are significantly different in terms of the star-rated scores."

For small pulmonary nodules (1-10mm) nodules, there are a limited number of CT data voxels within the solid tumor, making them difficult to process through traditional CAD(computer aided diagnosis) tools. Increasing feature extraction to include the surrounding parenchyma will increase the CT voxel set for analysis in these very small pulmonary nodule cases and likely improve diagnostic performance while keeping the CAD tool flexible to scanner model and parameters. In AdaBoost learning using naive Bayes and SVM weak classifier, a number of significant features were selected from 304 features. The results from the COPDGene test yielded an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Therefore proposed method can be used for the computer aided diagnosis effectively."
