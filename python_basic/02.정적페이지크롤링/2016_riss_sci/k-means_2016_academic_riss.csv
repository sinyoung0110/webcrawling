Fish Injured Rate Measurement Using Color Image Segmentation Method Based on K-Means Clustering Algorithm and Otsu’s Threshold Algorithm,2016,"['Image Segmentation', 'RGB', 'HSI', 'K-means Clustering Algorithm', 'Otsu’s Threshold Algorithm']",,"This paper proposes two measurement methods for injured rate of fish surface using color image segmentation method based on K-means clustering algorithm and Otsu’s threshold algorithm. To do this task, the following steps are done. Firstly, an RGB color image of the fish is obtained by the CCD color camera and then converted from RGB to HSI. Secondly, the S channel is extracted from HSI color space. Thirdly, by applying the K-means clustering algorithm to the HSI color space and applying the Otsu’s threshold algorithm to the S channel of HSI color space, the binary images are obtained. Fourthly, morphological processes such as dilation and erosion, etc. are applied to the binary image. Fifthly, to count the number of pixels, the connected-component labeling is adopted and the defined injured rate is gotten by calculating the pixels on the labeled images. Finally, to compare the performances of the proposed two measurement methods based on the K-means clustering algorithm and the Otsu’s threshold algorithm, the edge detection of the final binary image after morphological processing is done and matched with the gray image of the original RGB image obtained by CCD camera. The results show that the detected edge of injured part by the K-means clustering algorithm is more close to real injured edge than that by the Otsu’ threshold algorithm."

We showed that our K-Means algorithm using RHadoop with combiner was faster than regular algorithm without combiner as the size of data set increases. We also implemented Elbow method with MapReduce for finding the optimum number of clusters for K-Means clustering on large dataset. Comparison with our MapReduce implementation of Elbow method and classical kmeans() in R with small data showed similar results."
K-IFRS 도입 이후 기업지배구조와 기업규모가 외국인 투자에 미치는 영향,2016,"['국제회계기준', '외국인투자', '기업지배구조', '기업규모', 'K-IFRS', 'foreign investments', 'corporate governance', 'firm size']","본 연구는 K-IFRS 도입이 외국인 투자에 영향을 미치는지 여부를 분석하였다. 아울러 K-IFRS 도입 이후에 기업지배구조의 질과 기업규모가 외국인 투자에 추가적인 영향을 미치는지 여부를 분석하였다. 2009년부터 2013년까지 지속적으로 유가증권 거래소에 상장되어 있는 12월말 결산 법인 1,832개 기업-연수를 대상으로 분석하였다.  실증분석을 통한 본 연구의 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, K-IFRS 도입 이후 도입 이전보다 외국인 투자금액과 지분율이 유의하게 증가하였다. K-IFRS 도입에 따른 효과로 인해 외국인 투자자의 정보처리비용 및 경영자와 외국인 투자자들 간에 정보비대칭이 감소하여 외국인 투자가 증가한 것으로 판단된다. 둘째, 기업지배구조의 질에 따라 외국인 투자에 영향을 미친다는 결과를 확인하였다. 지배구조 총점뿐만 아니라 주주권리, 이사회, 공시, 감사기구, 그리고 경영과실배분 각각의 지배구조 요소들도 모두 외국인 투자를 유인하는 것을 확인하였다. 셋째, 지배구조 개별항목 중에서 이사회 기능이 양호한 기업일수록 외국인 투자금액이 추가적으로 더 증가하였다. 이는 경영자의 회계선택에 대한 재량권을 최종적으로 통제할 수 있는 기업지배구조 메커니즘은 이사회이기 때문에 K-IFRS 도입 이후 이사회의 역할이 더욱 중요해졌다. 따라서 K-IFRS 도입 이후에 외국인 투자자들은 기업지배구조 메커니즘들 중에서 이사회의 질을 더 비중있게 평가하여 투자 한다는 것을 알 수 있다. 반면에, 지배구조 총점수를 비롯한 다른 지배구조 개별항목은 통계적으로 유의하지 않은 결과를 보임으로써 K-IFRS 도입 이후 기업지배구조 중에서 이사회 기능의 중요성을 더욱 부각시켰다. 넷째, K-IFRS 도입 이후 도입 이전에 비해 외국인 투자자의 기업규모에 대한 선호효과가 감소한다는 결과를 확인하였다. K-IFRS 도입에 따른 수준 높은 공시요구 등이 상장기업에 일관성 있게 적용됨으로써 외국인 투자자들에게 자국편중(home-bias) 위험이 더 컸던 규모가 작은 기업의 정보비대칭이 더 감소함에 따라 외국인 투자가 더 증가한 것으로 판단된다.","This paper investigates domestic 1,832 firm-years listed on KOSPI between 2009 and 2013. The purpose is to identify whether foreign investments increases after IFRS adoption and whether firm size differently affects foreign investments. Also, as corporate governance has recently become a key component as part of the corporate sustainability management, this study explores whether corporate governance affects foreign investments.  Based on the analysis, first, it shows that foreign investments significantly increase after K-IFRS adoption. This can be attributed to the reduction in both costs for information processing by foreign investors and information asymmetry between managers and foreign investors.  Second, apart from IFRS adoption, foreign investments significantly increase as the quality of corporate governance are higher. All of the governance factors such as protection of shareholders"" rights, board characteristics, disclosure, audit characteristics, and business performance distribution. As the corporate governance efficiently controls the manager, information asymmetry between the management and investors decreases, attracting more foreign investments.  Third, with regard to individual item among corporate governance items companies with more functions of their board of directors are related to more foreign investments after K-IFRS adoption.   Fourth, the effect of a firm size on foreign investments reduces after K-IFRS adoption. This means that the characteristics of IFRS affect SME companies more than large companies, indicating that information asymmetry decreases much more for the former."
K-IFRS 도입 시점의 전환조정이 이후 기간의 회계정보의 가치관련성에 미치는 영향,2016,"['K-IFRS', 'K-GAAP', 'K-IFRS Reconciliation', 'Value Relevance', 'K-IFRS', 'K-GAAP', '전환조정', '가치관련성']","본 연구에서는 K-IFRS의 최초 도입시점에 발생한 회계수치의 전환조정이 그 이후 기간에 K-IFRS에 근거하여 작성된 회계정보의 유용성에 어떠한 영향을 미치는가를 실증적으로 검증하였다. 준거회계기준이 K-GAAP에서 K-IFRS로 변경될 때 양 기준의 차이로 인해 발생하는 전환조정과정은 K-IFRS 최초 재무제표의 근간을 이루기 때문에 회계정보의 유용성을 제고하는 방향으로 충실히 이행되어야 한다. 하지만, 최근의 연구들에서는 경영자가 사적효용을 추구하는 방향으로 회계기준의 전환과정에 자의적으로 개입하는 경향이 있음을 제시하고 있다(Capkun et al. 2011; Voulgaris et al. 2011). 이러한 경우에 따라서 만약, 경영자가 회계기준의 전환과정을 재량적으로 이용하였을 경우 K-IFRS에 근거하여 작성된 회계정보는 경영자의 의도에 따라 왜곡될 수 있으며 이로 인해 결국 K-IFRS 도입 이후 회계정보의 유용성이 악화될 수 있다.이러한 가능성을 검증하기 위해 본 연구에서는 K-IFRS 도입과정에서의 경영자의 재량적 전환조정 여부가 K-IFRS 도입 이후 순자산과 순이익 정보의 가치관련성에 어떠한 영향을 미치는가를 Ohlson(1995)의 가치평가모형을 원용하여 확인하였다. 분석결과, K-IFRS 도입에 따른 전환조정액이 비정상적으로 큰 기업의 경우 그 이후 기간에 작성된 순자산 및 순이익 정보의 가치관련성이 다른 기업에 비해 낮은 경향이 있는 것으로 관찰되었다. 이러한 결과는 또한 재량적 전환조정의 방향성을 고려한 분석과 전환조정액의 내생성을 통제한 Heckman(1979)의 2단계 분석에서도 다시금 확인되었다. 상술한 일관된 결과들은 K-IFRS로의 전환을 위한 회계변경 과정에 경영자가 사적효용을 추구하기 위해 자의적으로 개입하였을 가능성이 존재하며 이로 인해 전환조정액의 수준에 따라 K-IFRS 적용 재무제표의 유용성이 제한되고 있음을 시사한다. 이와 같이 본 연구는 K-IFRS에 근거한 회계정보의 유용성이 K-IFRS 최초 적용시점의 회계기준 전환과정에서 잠재적으로 발생할 수 있는 경영자의 자의적인 회계변경에 의해 달라질 수 있음에 대한 실증적 증거를 제공함으로써 K-IFRS 도입효과를 검증한 기존 연구에 시사하는 바가 클 것으로 기대된다.","Korean listed firms are mandated applied to K-IFRS from 2011. When Korean firms adopt K-IFRS, in order to aid investors in evaluating corporate performance over time, Korean companies must restate their 2010 K-GAAP financial statements applied by K-IFRS. These two sets of financial statements for 2010 are thus based on identical underlying economic activities and are fully specified according to two different accounting system: K-GAAP and K-IFRS. In here, K-IFRS reconciliation is very important issue because they can affect accounting numbers in the first financial statement applied K-IFRS, as well as to have long-term effects on future K-IFRS financial statements. However, K-IFRS reconciliation allows managers to exercise their accounting discretion, suggesting that this reconciliation could be used as a mean to opportunistic accounting choice. In that sense, if K-IFRS reconciliation can be used as a device for managerial pursuit of self-interests, the usefulness of financial statement applied K-IFRS can be diminished.The objective of this study is to investigates the impact of K-IFRS reconciliations on the value relevance of accounting information under the K-IFRS regime. Specifically, we examine whether K-IFRS reconciliation would improve or reduce the value relevance of financial statement information applied K-IFRS during the period from 2011 to 2014. The results of empirical analyses show that the explanatory power of K-IFRS based accounting earnings and net book value for the stock price tend to be reduced by K-IFRS reconciliation. This result indicates that managers are likely to use the adjustments process to reconcile K-GAAP accounting numbers with corresponding K-IFRS as means to realize the various private utility. The evidence obtained herein suggests the need for more rigid screening schemes for the K-IFRS reconciliation process and also for adequate measures to be taken to ensure that the interests of the outside investors are properly protected."

And examines overseas expansion effect on RM since K-IFRS(IFRS*OVERSEAS) adoption. Overseas expansion(OVERSEAS1) is measured by the ratio of export to total sales and overseas expansion(OVERSEAS2) is measured by the relative ratio of overseas assets to total assets. RM is composed of abnormal cash flow from operation(RM1), abnormal production cost(RM2), and abnormal discretionary expenses(RM3) and total of RM(RM4). The sample consists of non-banking firm(firm/year 2,051) listed in Korean Stock Exchange over 2007-2013,  According to the research, this study can draw the following conclusions.  First, IFRS variable has not significant sign but OVERSEAS1 and OVERSEAS2 variable has significant sign in correlation and regression analysis to RM. It is means K-IFRS adoption has not effect to RM but overseas expansion variable, which is a sort of environment or business characteristic, is important variable to RM.  Second, IFRS×OVERSEAS1 variable has positive sign to RM2, RM3. It implies export firms managers upgrade RM1 and RM2 since K-IFRS adoption. IFRS×OVERSEAS2 variable has negative sign to RM1. It implies managers with overseas assets downgrade RM1 since K-IFRS adoption.  OVERSEAS(overseas expansion) is significant sign to RM, but partially, not in all RM since K-IFRS adoption. Also sign direction is different according to type of OVERSEAS. It is means firms manager select part and direction to RM.  This study contributes to the regulators and investors by providing the empirical evidence regarding effect of overseas expansion variable to RM since K-IFRS adoption."

The tension between K which represents Korea and Pop which means American Popular music is essential in understanding K-Pop. The term “K-Pop” was named abroad and it means Idol-based -Western- dance- music. And the culture industry plays a leading role in its production. “Kayo” which is the Korean word for Korean Popular music had been considered as authentic Korean popular music, historically. However, Kayo is replaced by “K-Pop” which discards Korea’s musical identity and historical context. This elimination is due to K-Pop’s target of musical globalization. Instead, it took on contents of American popular music and gained musical universality. The proofs of musical universality are individual emotion’s expression regardless of local character and dance oriented music by means of trans- media strategy. These traits maximize economic profit. K-Pop aims to become a transnational popular music and in this process ‘K’ transformed into a brand name for exporting goods. K- Pop became a fictitious concept. K-Pop shows that class, nationality, gender based authenticity is thrown away in 21th century popular music."
K-IFRS 도입 이후 활동분류를 이용한 영업현금흐름 조정: 유인 및 회사채 신용등급에 미친 영향,2016,"['국제회계기준', '영업현금흐름조정', '활동분류', '회사채 신용등급', 'IFRS', 'operating cash flows management', 'classification', 'credit rating']",,"Since 2011 in which the IFRS was first adopted by Korean listed companies, a discretion is granted to managers when classifying cash receipts and payments of interest and dividends on the statement of cash flows. On one hand, this discretion is expected to improve the quality of accounting information by allowing managers to reflect the economic substance of those cash flows in categorizing them. On the other hand, a possibility opens up that managers could employ the discretion as a means of managing operating cash flows(CFOs). The main purpose of this study is to identify those firms who use the discretion in a way to increase CFOs, and investigate their incentives. Unlike prior studies that only examine the firms who classify interest payments as financing activities, this study analyzes not only these firms of the prior studies but also the firms who classify the receipts of interest and dividends as investing activities. Further, the analysis of this study is confined only to those firms who are subject to credit ratings because CFOs are one of the most important factors that the credit-rating agencies consider in determining firms’ ratings. It is well known in the literature that earnings are superior to CFOs as a summary measure of firm performance (Dechow 1994). However, in specific situations CFOs could provide information that earnings can seldom do. For example, the payment of interests and the principal is ensured if the debt-issuing firms can generate a stable stream of cash flows from operations. Bond investors will thus consider CFOs more important than earnings in making decisions. Further, firms’ ability to generate an adequate amount of CFOs is taken into account as one of the most important factors when credit-rating agencies analyze firms’ credit-worthiness and assign ratings (Standard & Poor``s 2008; Nice Rating 2015). This implies that firms who receive credit ratings will be concerned about how to present CFOs on the statement of cash flows. Specifically, we posit that firms with lower ratings will have stronger incentives to inflate CFOs with intent to receive good ratings. We thus first hypothesize that after the initial adoption of the IFRS, Korean firms with lower credit ratings are more likely to classify cash receipts and payments of interest and dividends in a way to boost CFOs. Furthermore, a downgrade below ‘investment grade’ causes severe economic consequences such as a violation of debt covenants or a failure to raise equity capital. Thus, we additionally hypothesize that the management of CFOs would be more pronounced for the firms who are in the proximity of the borderline between ‘investment’ and ‘non-investment’ grade. Out of 960 firms for the period from 2011 to 2014, we find 190 classifying interest payments as financing instead of operating activities. Included in the 190 firms are those that classify interest and dividend receipts as investing rather than operating activities, and it is not conceptually obvious whether these firms intentionally manage CFOs because such classification of interest and dividend receipts is not entirely consistent with maximizing CFOs. However, provided that the amount of interest payments is substantially larger than the interest and dividend received, we could presume that these firms may have intent to manage CFOs because the net effect of such classification works for increasing CFOs. Accordingly, the firms that are deemed to manage CFOs include the following two groups: 1) the firms that classify interest payments as financing, but interest and dividend receipts as operating activities, and 2) the firms that categorize all cash interest and dividend items as non-operating activities and for which the ratio of interest payments to the receipts of cash interest and dividend falls in the top quartile of the full sample (or alternatively the firms for which the ratio is greater than the median). The main results of the study are as follows. First, we find that firms with lower credit ratings are more likely to increase CFOs via the discretionary classification of receipts and payments of interest and dividends. In particular, we document that firms whose ratings fall on the border line between investment and non-investment grade have stronger incentives to increase CFOs. Interestingly, however, such empirical phenomena are not statistically significant for the firms who classify interest payments as financing activities: i.e., the firms that are deemed to manage CFOs in prior studies. Our result suggests that firms with intent to inflate CFOs would consider all cash items, not just cash interest payments, which managers have discretions under the IFRS to categorize on the cash flow statement. Our findings in the main analyses indirectly signify that firms with lower credit ratings manage CFOs in anticipation that they may receive better ratings by doing so than they would otherwise do. So, in an additional analysis, we investigate whether such anticipation is fulfilled ex post. We find to the contrary that the credit-rating agencies discount the ratings of the firms who engage in the management of CFOs. This result suggests that the credit-rating agencies see through the incentives of the firms who manage CFOs and respond negatively. It also indicates that the expectations of the CFOs-managing firms are not rational in light of the rational-expectations theory in which every economic agent’s expectations are fulfilled in equilibrium. We view our empirical result as an off-equilibrium phenomenon, which may be justified by the fact that the adoption of the IFRS is a first-time experience to Korean managers. As learning is gained by the market participants, this transitory off-equilibrium phenomenon will disappear."

Non글로벌기업은 장부가액과 주가와의 관련성이 높으나 순이익과 주가와의 관련성은 낮아서 신뢰성 있는 공정가치 평가를 위한 노력이 필요할 것으로 보인다. 셋째, IFRS 도입 이후 글로벌기업은 Non글로벌기업과 비교하여 기업가치가 감소하고 있어 글로벌기업보다는 Non글로벌기업이 IFRS 도입의 효과를 보고 있음을 알 수 있다. 즉 이전부터 질적수준이 높은 재무제표를 작성했다고 볼 수 있는 글로벌기업 보다는 Non글로벌기업의 회계정보의 질적수준이 높아지고 자본비용이 낮아지면서 상대적으로 기업가치도 증가하였음을 알 수 있다. 이는 원래 신뢰성 있는 재무제표를 작성하여 코리아디스카운트를 해소하자는 IFRS의 도입목적이 어느 정도 달성되었다고 볼 수 있다.","This study examines whether there are difference of cost of capital, difference between BV and NI on value relevance, and whether there are difference of effect on firm value according to global and non－global firms since IFRS adoption in Korea. The samples are obtained from the KIS－VALUE and used consolidated financial statements listed on Korean Stock from 2007 to 2013. Our empirical results are summarized as follows. First, we found that cost of capital significantly decrease since IFRS adoption but we couldn`t find evidence compare with non －global firm, cost of capital for global firm decrease significantly. Secondly, this study shows value relevance of BV in global firms have been significantly decrease compare with non－global firms, while value relevance of NI significantly increase since IFRS adoption. It is means information on NI have reliability in global firms than non －global firms with IFRS adoption. Also, global firms have negative sign to firm value(TQ：market value/book value) since IFRS adoption, it can be informed non－global firms have benefit than global firms with IFRS adoption. This results illustrates that IFRS adoption purpose by saying Korea discount resolve with reliable financial statements have achieved."

So a lot of philosophers have strived to found a theory for overcoming them and to make an alternative idea for human life. K. Kojin suggests Association(Assoziation) instead of capitalistic economy. Association means not only Socialism as an Idea but also an ideal of Socialism. He persuasively demonstrates his assertion by use of a transcendental critique and Transcendental Philosophy, i.e. Transcritique. His philosophical grounds are from Immanuel Kant`s Critique of pure Reason and K. Marx`s Theory of Capitalism. In other words, it is a self-critique of reason, a contradiction of capital and a relation of them. This essay studies how socialism and communism can relate with a transcendental critique and aims to justify socialism as a transcendental critique by parallax, antinomy and Copernican revolution in texts of Kant and Marx."

K-LB는 새만금신항을 중심으로 하는 대중국 열차페리시스템인 left-wing과 영일만항을 중심으로 하는 대러시아 열차페리시스템인 light-wing으로 하는 양 날개를 우리나라 기존 철도시스템으로 연계하는 시스템을 말한다.  본 연구는 K-LB가 현 조건과 상황에서 실효성 있는 국제물류시스템이라 확신하며 이의 도입에 관한 타당성을 제시하였다. 보다 엄밀히 말하면 도입 타당성을 확보하기에 앞서 계량화가 가능한 운송비용을 최소화 시키는 목적함수하의 선형계획모형을 통하여 K-LB의 효율성이 확보되는 운송비에서의 가용범위와 조건을 제시하였다. 연구결과는 해상운송보다 열차페리가 34.5% 정도 저렴한 비용 수준을 확보할 수 있다면 열차페리에 의한 K-LB에 경쟁력이 확보될 수 있음을 밝히고 있다. 이는 열차페리가 컨테이너전용선보다 신속한 통관시간과 절차뿐만 아니라 양하역비가 절감되는 유연한 양하역작업을 감안한다면 그 임계수준이 크지 않으며 동북아 국제물류시스템에서 충분히 경쟁력을 확보할 수 있는 시스템임을 의미한다.,"China has recently advocated a national strategy called “One Belt One Road” and transferred to execution to refine it into detailed action plans and has continued to fix the complement. However, the Korean Peninsula, including the North Korea remains could not be included at all in the Chinese development policy and framework in terms of the International Logistics. Currently it is raised between Korea-China rail ferry system again and that is when we need to make effective policy development on international multimodal transport system in Northeast Asia. This paper introduces the K-LB (Korea LandBridge) as its execution plan and conducted a feasibility study on this. K-LB consists of a Korea-Russian train ferry system based in Pohang Yeongil New Port(light-wing) and a Korea-China train ferry system based in Saemangeum New Port(left-wing). These two wings are linked to the existing rail system in Korea.  This study is convinced that the K-LB is an effective international logistics system in the current terms and conditions and also demonstrated that it is feasible to introduce th K-LB on the peninsula. More strictly speaking, through a linear programming under objective function that minimize the transport cost quantified prior to demonstrate the feasibility, the available ranges and conditions for the transportation costs that are ensured the effectiveness of the K-LB are presented as results. According to the results, if the transport cost of K-LB is cheaper about 34.5% than that of sea transport such as container transport, the object goods may be transported by K-LB on this route. It means that the K-LB system has a competitive advantage due to more rapid customs clearance as well as omitted loading and unloading procedures over container transportation system. It also noted that the threshold level may not be large. Therefore, K-LB has competitive enough to prove its introduction in the Northeast Asian logistics system."

K-REITs의 차입이자율과 금리 변수 간 관계 분석,2016,"['ARDL Model', 'K-REITs', 'loaning interest rate', 'long term interest rate']","본 연구는 국내 리츠가 운용된 2002년부터 2015년까지의 리츠사의 타인자본에 대한 차입이자율을 월별 자료로 구축 하여 차입이자율의 흐름과 금리변수와의 관계를 분석하였다. 선행연구를 검토한 결과 리츠사의 차입이자율은 리츠 내부의 고유요인에 의해 결정되기도 하지만 거시경제변수 중 금리변수와 연계성이 높게 나타났다. 이에 본 연구는 K-REITs 차입이 자율과 금리 변수 간에 ARDL(autoregressive distributed lag: 자기회귀시차) 모형을 설정하여 장기관계를 분석하였으며, ARDL-ECM 모형을 기반하여 단기 관계도 검토하였다. 실증분석 결과 K-REITs 차입이자율과 국고채 3년, 국고채 5년, 회사 채(AA-,3년), 기업일반자금 대출금리에서 장기 공적분 관계가 형성되었으며, 이는 K-REITs 차입이자율이 장기금리 변수와 동조하고 있음을 보여준다. 또한, 기업일반자금 대출금리는 장기 관계와 단기 조정 과정에서도 K-REITs 차입이자율과의 연 계성이 높게 나타났다. REITs가 금융권 차입에 관한 사항과 경영계획 수립 시에 기업일반자금 대출금리와 같은 장기금리 변수의 동향 등을 고려하여 의사결정 한다면 K-REITs 발전에 실질적인 도움이 될 수 있을 것이다.","This study analyzed the long term relationship between the K-REITs' lending rate and interest rate variables based on ARDL (autoregressive distributed lag) and also examined the short term relationship based on the ARDL-ECM model. In the results of the empirical test, there is a co-integration relationship among the K-REITs' lending rate, 3 year government bond (rate), 3 year government bond (rate), corporation bond (rate) (AA-, 3year) and general fund loan rate. This means that the K-REITs' lending rate is related to the long term interest rate. The corporate general fund loan rate has a significant correlation with the K-REITs' lending rate in the long term relation and short term adjustment process. The establishment of a management plan by the REITs considering the trends in the corporate general fund loan rate in the decision making process for finance sector borrowings can be practically helpful for the K-REITs."
A way to increase K-SURE’s export insurance recoveries through arbitration by subrogation,2016,"['Export insurance', 'Subrogation by insurer', 'Arbitration by subrogation', 'Assignment of claim']",,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to utilize the concept of arbitration by subrogation as a means to increase recoveries of indemnities paid out to exporters or any financial institutions by K-SURE, an export credit agency of Korea, against possible non-payment or breach of obligations from the buyer or the buyer’s country. It looks into the possibility of K-SURE and KCAB reactivating its 2004 MOU to give more jurisdictional protection to K-SURE’s indemnities recovery transactions.Design/methodology/approach – This paper first introduces a brief elucidation about export insurance provided by K-SURE and the necessity of arbitration in the export insurance, and a summary of a subrogation arbitration case referred to the KCAB by K-SURE in 2005. Cognizant of the 2004 MOU between K-SURE and KCAB, as well as the foreign and domestic developments in arbitration, the paper then analyzes legal principles of subrogation by insurer, as well as domestic and overseas precedents on the matters of assignment of claim and arbitration by subrogation.Findings – While it appears that there is still no universally recognized authority nor established court precedents applying arbitration by subrogation, the authors discovered that similar to Korea, most of leading courts in the world have consistently held that the assignee can request and be requested for arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement contained in the assigned contract.The paper concludes that the K-SURE now can be admitted as a party having proper standing in the arbitration proceedings so long as the specific claim right under the contract which includes the arbitration agreement is assigned to the K-SURE.Originality/value – This paper suggests a possible plan to increase recoveries in export insurance. The outcome of the research is expected to enhance the arbitration system on the back of increasing numbers of arbitration related to export insurance, to improve the balance sheet of K-SURE and ultimately, to help the Korean economy by collecting export insurance recoveries which will lead to saving Korean people’s tax."

Methods: The GAI and Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) in K-WISC-IV were compared for a group of 79 children with ADHD and 234 normal children. The mean differences within each group were testified by the t-test and Cohen’s d. The Wechsler’s descriptive classifications for each GAI and FSIQ score were analyzed in the children with ADHD. Additionally, the critical value for the difference between the means of the FSIQ and GAI was calculated in the normal children.  Results: The score on the GAI was higher than that on the FSIQ in the children with ADHD, with a mean difference of 2.19 points. The implications of these findings are discussed regarding the cognitive characteristics of the children with ADHD. According to Wechsler’s descriptive classification, the application of the GAI showed a lower (7.59%), equal (61.65%) or higher (60.76%) prevalence of ADHD compared to the application of FSIQ.  Conclusion: The implications of these findings are discussed regarding the cognitive characteristics of the children with ADHD. The GAI reflecting the attention and behavioral problems in children with ADHD could be utilized as an alternative global intelligence estimate that considers their potential for development."

A long-lived isomeric state with T<SUB>½</SUB>=0.71(5) s and K<SUP>π</SUP>=8<SUP>-</SUP> has been identified at 1278 keV, which decays to the ground-state and γ-vibrational bands through hindered electromagnetic transitions, as well as to the daughter nucleus <SUP>172</SUP>Ho via allowed β decays. The robust nature of the K<SUP>π</SUP>=8<SUP>-</SUP> isomer and the ground-state rotational band reveals an axially-symmetric structure for this nucleus. Meanwhile, the γ-vibrational levels have been identified at unusually low excitation energy compared to the neighboring well-deformed nuclei, indicating the significance of the microscopic effect on the non-axial collectivity in this doubly mid-shell region. The underlying mechanism of enhanced γ vibration is discussed in comparison with the deformed Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation based on a Skyrme energy-density functional."

Black Currant (Ribes nigrum L.) Extract Induces Apoptosis of MKN-45 and TE-1 Cells Through MAPK- and PI3K/Akt-Mediated Mitochondrial Pathways,2016,"['apoptosis', 'black currant extract', 'MKN-45 cells', 'TE-1 cells']",,"Black currant extract (BCE) is rich in polyphenols and can induce apoptosis in various cancer cells, but the molecular mechanism by which BCE induces cancer cell apoptosis has not been reported. The aim of this work was to elucidate the antitumor effect of BCE and the signal transduction pathways involved. MTT test results revealed that the viability of MKN-45 and TE-1 cells treated with BCE gradually decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, with significant effects achieved after 12 h of treatment. MKN-45 and TE-1 cells clearly showed characteristics of apoptosis: shrinkage, cytoplasmic condensation, and formation of cytoplasmic filaments, even partial detachment. In addition, these results showed MKN-45 cells showed a higher level of apoptosis than TE-1 cells when treated with BCE. Western blot assays showed that the Bcl-2/Bax ratio decreased in both MKN-45 and TE-1 cells, indicating that BCE induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. In addition, BCE-induced apoptosis was mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction involving the PI3K/Akt pathway in both MKN-45 and TE-1 cells. However, BCE-induced cell apoptosis was mediated by the Fas receptor pathway in MKN-45 cells but not in TE-1 cells. BCE-induced apoptosis in MKN-45 cells was associated with the MAP-kinase signaling pathway through the activation of p38 and JNK and the inactivation of Erk1/2. However, it was associated with the MAP-kinase signaling pathway only by means of activation of p38 and JNK in TE-1 cells. These results showed that BCE induces apoptosis of MKN-45 and TE-1 cells through MAPK- and PI3K/Akt-mediated mitochondrial pathways. Thus, BCE may be a promising anticancer candidate."

On the assumption of this fact, targeting 272 songs among 360 songs which exclude overlaps in recent three years monthly chart on `Melon`, this research examined the language, language choice, and the aspects and functions of code-switching as specifics of K-pop lyrics. The summary of result is as follows. First, 171 songs, which consists 63.9% of 272 subjecting songs showed the code-switching, especially 72.8% showed code-switching on 2015, implying code-switching is on the rise. Second, while most code-switching is done with Korean(base language) and English(insertion language), also Panjabi and French had been chosen. This reflects the aspects of globalization, which suggests possibility that language choice of K-pop can be expanded to other languages besides English. Third, when divide code-switching into code-mixing and narrow sense of code-switching, 124 songs(72.5%) showed code-mixing with code switching. This shows most of K-pop lyrics is showing code-switching and code-mixing at the same time. Fourth, code-switching`s discourse function appears on K-pop lyrics can be subdivided into musical and meaning functions. Musical function includes `rhyme, refrain, rejoinder`, meaning function includes `expression of identity, emphasis, clarification, euphemism, quotation`. This research is significant in investigation of recent aspects and functions of language selection and code-switching. Especially it is distinguished among existing researches in that it embodied function of code-switching by dividing it into two separate functions-musical and meaning."

Two main research questions are examined in this study. The first question is how the number of titles of account on the statement of financial position has changed after adoption of K-IFRS. The second question is how the number of footnote disclosures on the statement of financial position has changed after adoption of K-IFRS.Main results of this study are summarized as follows. First, the number of asset items presented separately on the statement of financial position were decreased 63.66% on average, from 44.85 to 16.3. The number of liability  items were decreased 30.26% on average, from 19.00 to 13.25.  The number of owner's equity  items were decreased 56.29% on average, from 17.02 to 7.44. Second, the number of footnote disclosures on the statement of financial position were increased significantly after adoption of K-IFRS. The number of footnote disclosures on Asset were decreased from 21.77 to 27.34 on average. The number of footnote disclosures on Liability were increased from 14.56 to 19.12 on average. However, the number of footnote disclosures on Owner’s equity were decreased from 9.10 to 5.09 on average. Third, there are still many items that their meanings are same but their names of title are different after adoption of K-IFRS.Implications from this study are as follows. First, the adoption of K-IFRS made firm's accounting disclosures simplify and  made firm's  quantitative criterion to decide the separate presentation of titles of account more rigid when compared with K-GAAP. Second, it is necessary to standardize the name of titles of account to improve the comparability and understanding of financial statements.This study was based on the individual statement of financial position. In the future research, it is necessary to examine accounting disclosures including consolidated financial statements."

연구논문(硏究論文) : K-IFRS 도입기에 따른 순이익과 성과측정치의 가치관련성 연구,2016,"['연결재무제표', '개별재무제표', '주당순이익', '주당영업이익', 'K-IFRS', 'EPS', 'BPS', 'Separate financial statements']","본 연구는 Ohlson(1995)의 모형을 이용하여 개별재무제표와 연결재무제표의 주당장부가치(BPS)와 주당순이익(EPS)의 가치관련성에 대하여 비교 분석하고, 개별재무제표와 연결재무제표의 주당 이자 및 법인세 차감전 영업현금흐름(EBITDA), 주당영업이익(OIPS), 주당법인세비용차감전순이익(IBCTPS), 성과측정치인 주당순이익(EPS), 주당포괄이익(CIPS), 주당영업활동으로 인한 현금흐름(OCFPS)등이 기업가치에 미치는 영향을 검증하여 어느 성과측정치의 정보가 기업가치를 잘 설명하고, 설명력의 차이가 있는지 K－IFRS 도입이전(2008년~2009년)과 K－IFRS 도입기 (2010년～2011년), 도입이후 (2012년～2013년도)기간을 비교하여 분석하였다. 연구 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, 개별재무제표에서 K－IFRS 도입기에 순이익의 가치관련성이 높았고, K－IFRS 도입 후에 주당장부가치의 가치관련성이 높았다. 연결재무제표에서는 K－IFRS 도입기에 순이익의 가치관련성이 상대적으로 높았고, 주당장부가치의 가치관련성은 K－IFRS 도입후에 가치관련성이 상대적으로 높았다. 둘째, 성과측정치의 기업가치 설명력을 분석한 결과 개별재무제표에서 K－IFRS 도입 전에는 법인세비용 차감전 순이익(IBCTPS)이, K－IFRS 도입 후에는 주당영업이익(OIPS)이주가와의 관련성이 높게 나타났다. 연결재무제표에서는 K－IFRS 도입기 전 후 주당순이익 (EPS)이 주가와 관련성이 가장 높게 나타났다. 개별 재무제표상에서 K－IFRS 도입 전에는 IBCTPS(주당 법인세비용 차감 전 순이익)이가장 의미 있는 재무성과 측정치로 사용되었으나 K－IFRS 도입 후에는 OIPS(주당 영업이익)을 재무성과 측정치로서 의사결정에 사용하고 있다고 볼 수 있다. K－ IFRS 도입 후, 종속기업이 포함되지 않은 지배기업의 개별 재무제표에서는 주당 영업이익이 여러 성과 측정치중 주가를 가장 잘 설명하고 있다고 해석할 수 있다.","This study utilized the Ohlson model (1995) to compare and analyze the value relevance of the book value per share (BPS) and earnings per share (EPS) of separate financial statements and consolidated financial statements, and to verify the effects of EBITDA per share, operating income per share (OIPS), income before corporation tax per share (IBCTPS), EPS, comprehensive income per share (CIPS), and operating cash flow per share (OCFPS) of separate and consolidated financial statements on corporate value. The result of this study is as follows. First, for the separate financial statements, the value relevance of net profit was high in the K－IFRS introduction period and the value relevance of BPS was high during post－K－IFRS. In the consolidated financial statements, the value relevance of net profit was relatively high during the K－IFRS introduction period and the value relevance of BPS showed to be relatively higher after introducing the K－IFRS. Second, having analyzed the corporate value explanation ability of performance measurements, IBCTPS and OIPS showed to have high relevance to shares before and after adopting KIFRS, respectively, for separate financial statements. And EPS was analyzed to have the highest relevance to shares in the pre－and post－K－IFRS periods for consolidated financial statements. For separate financial statements, IBCTPS was used as the most significant financial performance measurement in the pre－K－IFRS period, but after K－IFRS was adopted, OIPS was the major financial performance measurement used in decision－making. This can be interpreted to mean that in the post－K－IFRS period, OIPS best explains shares, among various performance measurements, in the separate financial statements of a governing corporation excluding its subordinate companies."

From literary and filmic depictions as black-caped, coffin-dwelling creatures of the night, in recent years vampires have come to live among us. Rather than being seen as threatening predators, contemporary vampires have found ways to live among humans, and are now students, have jobs, have families, and contribute to society. And yet their difference from mortals and their special capabilities give this “new vampire,” often stronger and immortal, the option to do good or evil within human society. The “K-vampire,” the new vampire with a Korean twist, has largely taken shape in the last decade, borrowing primarily from Western examples but also taking a uniquely Korean phenotype. Some of the recent K-vampires are professionals, indeed doctors, priests, prosecutors, and private detectives. In this essay, I focus on the OCN television series Vampire Prosecutor (Season 1, 2011) to explore the meaning of a vampire in the role of a law-enforcer, of a professional tasked with maintaining law and order in human society. The series operates as an explicit critique of corruption in Korean society, and the character in the title role is an impeccable prosecutor who believes in the absolute rule of law despite the prevailing surroundings. What are the options for rule by law in a society where most legal officials may be corrupt, and what does it mean that a vampire is placed in the title role to fight such corruption?"

The purpose of this study is to investigate the metaphysical characteristics of his nature poems from many other angles. I intended to extend scope of existing research that has been limited to LaoZhuang thoughts(老莊思想) and Buddhism.  Ontic concept of self is highlighted in Lee Seong-Seon""s poems. According to his poem""s statement, the absolute being exists in the inner self and we can reach nirvana via awareness of true self. This character of self is opposed to theory of absence of ego in Buddhism, it is approximation to Atman of Upanishad.  At the same time, the absolute being in his poems have many similarities with Brahman that is regarded as a source of all things, also omnipresent in nature of heaven and earth. These properties of source and omnipresence make him equate nature with the ultimate truth of universe and self. In his poems a oneness with nature has meaning of seeking after truth because of this.  Beomairyeo(梵我一如) thought of Upanishad formed thematic consciousness of his poems, also offered a fundamental vision of nature. These lead us to the conclusion that thought of Upanishad provided a foundation for his unique metaphysical nature poems."

The Comparison of M-B CDI-K Short Form and K-ASQ as Screening Test for Language Development,2016,"['Language development disorder', 'Sensitivity and specificity', 'Accuracy']",,"Objective  To investigate the usefulness of the communication domain in the Korean version of Ages and Stages Questionnaire (K-ASQ), and short form of the Korean version of MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (M-B CDI-K), as screening tests for language developmental delay. Methods  Data was collected between April 2010 and December 2013, from children who visited either the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation or the Developmental Delay Clinic, presenting with language development delay as their chief complaint. All the children took the short form of M-B CDI-K and K-ASQ as screening tests, and received diagnostic language assessments including Sequenced Language Scale for Infants (SELSI) or Preschool Receptive-Expressive Language Scale (PRES).Results  A total of 206 children, mean age 29.7 months, were enrolled. The final diagnoses were developmental language disorder, global developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, etc. The M-B CDI-K short form and the communication domain of the K-ASQ had 95.9% and 76.7% sensitivity, and 82.4% and 85.3% specificity, with regards to diagnostic language assessments. The M-B CDI-K short form showed higher negative predictive value and better accuracy than the communication domain of the K-ASQ. Conclusion  The screening ability of K-ASQ was not sufficient for children with language development delay, and the M-B CDI-K short form should be implemented for additional screening."

Validity and Reliability of a Selfadministered Food Frequency Questionnaire to Assess Vitamin K Intake in Korean Adults,2016,"['Food frequency questionnaire', 'Vitamin K', 'Validity', 'Reliability', 'Korean adults']",,"This study was conducted to validate a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess vitamin K intake in clinical and research settings based on data from the Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES V). We collected a subset of data on informative food items using the 24-hour recall method from adults aged 19 to 64 years from KNHANES V. The cumulative percent contribution and cumulative multiple regression coefficients for vitamin K intake from each food were computed. Twenty-five foods items were selected for the FFQ to assess vitamin K intake. The FFQ was validated against intakes derived from a 5-day food record (5DR) (n = 48). To assess the reliability of the FFQ, participants completed the self-administered FFQ (FFQ1) and a second FFQ (FFQ2) after a 6-month period (n = 54). Data were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficients, the cross-classification method, and Bland-Altman plots. Mean intakes were similar for vitamin K between the FFQ and dietary records, with significant correlations observed (r = 0.652), and cross-classification analyses demonstrated no major misclassification of participants into intake quartiles. Bland-Altman plots showed no serious systematic bias between the administrations of the two dietary assessment methods over the range of mean intakes. FFQ reliability was high, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.560. This pilot study shows promising validation and reliability evidence for the use of this FFQ, which is focused on vitamin K intake in adults, as an efficient screening tool in clinical and research settings."

BROOK90-K consists of three main modules. The first module was designed to simulate water balance for reservoir and its catchment. The second and third module was designed to simulate hydrological processes in rice paddy fields located on lower watershed and lower watershed excluding rice paddy fields. The models consider behavior of floodgate manager for estimating the storage of reservoir, and modules for water balance in lower watershed reflects agricultural factors, such as irrigation period and, complex sources of water supply, as well as irrigation methods. In this study, the models were applied on Guryangcheon stream watershed. R2, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS), NS-log1p, and root mean square error between simulated and observed discharge were 0.79, 0.79, 0.69, and 4.27 mm/d respectively in the model calibration period (2001~2003). Furthermore, the model efficiencies were 0.91, 0.91, 0.73, and 2.38 mm/d respectively over the model validation period (2004~2006). In the future, the developed BROOK90-K is expected to be utilized for various modeling studies, such as the prediction of water demand, water quality environment analysis, and the development of algorithms for effective management of reservoir."
Mid-term quasi-periodicities in the CaII-K plage index of the Sun and their implications,2016,,,"<P>We present results of the fast Fourier transform (FFT), the MEM analysis, and the wavelet analysis (WA), of the temporal variation of the monthly disk integrated 'CaII-K plage-area and enhanced network (EN) area' hereafter called 'plage index' derived by Tlatov et al. (2009), from spectro-heliograms taken in Ca II K line at Kodaikanal Observatory, from February 1907 to April, 1998, In the range >3 months and < decade, the Fourier transform power spectra reveal solar cycle periodicity similar to 122 months, its sub-harmonic similar to 61 months, two short quasi-periodicities (>2 and <4 months), and nine 'intermediate-range' quasi-periodicities (greater than or similar to 4 mo and <11 yr), in the variation of the plage index. The quasi-periodicities include Rieger, Rieger type and quasi-biennial. The presence of quasi-periodicities and the mean values of the periods are confirmed by the maximum entropy method (MEM). The temporal spans of the quasi-periodicities during different solar cycles are determined from the complex Morlet-wavelet analyses. The Rieger quasi-periodicity (150-160 days) appeared during cycle 21 and cycle 22. Each of the quasi-periodicities in the studied range lies close to one or more planetary periodicities (orbital, or spring tidal, or heliocentric conjunction frequency). We discuss possible interpretations of our results, and those of similar results obtained earlier by other authors, towards understanding the mechanisms of excitation of various quasi-periodicities detected in solar variability parameters.</P>"
Role of Voltage and Gas in Determining the Mean Diameter in Sn-58 Bi Intermetallic Compound Nanoparticles for Pulsed Wire Discharge,2016,"['compounds', 'thermomechanical processing', 'microstructure', 'scanning electron microscopy (SEM)', 'Pulsed wire discharge (PWD)']",,"Pulsed wire discharge using Sn-58 Bi wires was used to synthesize intermetallic Sn-58 Bi compound nanoparticles. We investigate that nanopowder particle size is controlled by voltage and gas atmosphere. A large pulsed current was applied to the alloy wires set between the electrodes in two gas atmosphere such as Ar, N2. We were discussed the results based on the k factor. The k factor means Ec/Ev, where Ec and Ev are the charging energy of the capacitor and the vaporization energy of the wire. Nanoparticles whose composition was close to that of Sn-58 Bi were synthesized under N2 atmosphere and 6 kV voltage. In such conditions, the applied energy to the wire was higher than sublimation energy of the wires. Under the other experimental conditions, other phases such as Bi-rich and Sn-Bi compound phases were detected. The major results in this study demonstrate the synthesis of alloy nano powders by using alloy wire."

For this reason, it is important to measure the sitting posture. We proposed a strategy for classification of sitting posture using machine learning. We retrieved acceleration data from single tri-axial accelerometer attached on the back of the subject’s neck in 5-types of sitting posture. 6 subjects without any spinal disorder were participated in this experiment. Acceleration data were transformed to the feature vectors of principle component analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) and K-means clustering were used to classify sitting posture with the transformed feature vectors. To evaluate performance, we calculated the correct rate for each classification strategy. Although the correct rate of SVM in sitting back arch was lower than that of K-means clustering by 2.0%, SVM’s correct rate was higher by 1.3%, 5.2%, 16.6%, 7.1% in a normal posture, sitting front arch, sitting cross-legged, sitting leaning right, respectively. In conclusion, the overall correction rates were 94.5% and 88.84% in SVM and K-means clustering respectively, which means that SVM have more advantage than K-means method for classification of sitting posture."

The achievement has laid an institutional foundation for the preservation and transmission of the folk song, including the constant discovery of and support for regional variations. What’s more, in keeping with the nationwide initiative to promote cultural content in recent years, continued efforts have been made to share and spread the values of Arirang. The popularity of the song that is recognized as both a National and a World’s Important Intangible Cultural asset is now expected to help increase the number of the Arirang festivals.The Arirang Festival still has a long way to go. If the festival is to compete on a level playing field with other regional events, there is a need to transform the way it is organized and performed. The oral literature means the oral culture and plays an integral role in creating local culture. In fact, the cultural festival is required to turn itself into something that combines yesterday and today while focusing on its originality, the biggest contributor to its inscription. In other words, the efforts to transform the current festival should be done in such a way that meets the needs of the participants by consistently seeking the distinctive values of Arirang. Changing the criteria for performance evaluation of the festival and encouraging an active, local participation into the content development can be a way. At the same time, the competitiveness of the festival for an amusing community should be further sharpened. Seeking a way to share the oral literature with more people is also required.The popularity of the Arirang festivals that now take the form of a comprehensive theme park has increased notably among regions where the song was originated. The festivals that named after their originating provinces are necessary to discover new killer content based on a certain theme while making multifaceted approach to preservation, restoration and transmission of their original values. The content might include Silgyeong (scenic background) Musical, acoustic holograms, B-boy Madang Nori and Jadam Arirang. Partnering with the Arirang Museum and Arirang training centers will also be helpful in systematically developing the new content. In doing so, the development should focus not only on academic but practical achievements (cultural content and storytelling resources), which can make contributions to the improvement of local communities and quality of their people’s lives. The resources can be found in orally transmitted laugh, emotional fun, shared creativity and a sense of happiness for healing. When it comes to utilizing the oral literature and resources, places and regions are the first thing to consider.The Korean Wave festivals led by K-Arirang is expected to play a critical role in promoting communication and sympathy not only in Korea but countries across the world. Despite the booming K-culture in recent years, most of the participants of numerous Arirang festivals are locals from their respected regions. However, given the increasing popularity of K-pop songs worldwide, the K-Arirang festivals have the potential to gain such popularity. It is also likely that such festivals can be held between the North and the South, Korea and China and even Japan. In fact, the North-South Korea Arirang festival fits exactly the spirit of the Arirang."

Each text shows two different views of individuals which are Eastern one and Western, so I can study with a comparative view of different cultural sides. Hae-jun Lee’s Castaway on the Moon describes a survival story of a man with no name in order to satire inhuman and miserable sides of capitalism in this 21th century. David Pledger’s K also shows the similar sides of dirty capitalism with a man called K who resists the coercive hierarchy. Individuals in both texts are getting destroyed when the stories go on, but I could find out how to overcome the corrupt neo-liberal capitalism in the texts.  Lee’s Castaway on the Moon shows a way of reconciliation between highest and lowest people with so-called karma capitalism. It emphasizes social unification with understanding of each other and public wealth. Pledger’ K shows K’s resistance spirit with parrhesia which Michel Foucault said in his last lecture, and it means courage to tell a truth.

In this paper, we proposed a method to estimate the mean or total of a population which has a linear trend, for the case when the reciprocal, k, of the sampling fraction is an even number and the sample size n is an odd number. The proposed method consists of drawing a sample by Sethi's (1968) balanced systematic sampling, and estimating the population mean by the least squares regression estimation method, in which the sampling unit number is used as the explanatory variable. The proposed method was compared with existing methods under the expected mean square error criterion based on Cochran's (1946) infinite superpopulation model. Being compared with methods which use simple sample means, the proposed method was shown to be more efficient as the variance sigma^2 of the random error term of the superpopulation model is smaller. It was also compared for various combination of (k,n) with methods which use weighted sample means, and turned out to be more efficient."
Coordinated Cognitive Tethering in Dense Wireless Areas,2016,"['Graph coloring', 'interference management', 'k- means clustering', 'resource allocation', 'white spaces']",,"This paper examines the resource gain that can be obtained from the creation of clusters of nodes in densely populated areas. A single node within each such cluster is designated as a “hotspot”; all other nodes then communicate with a destination node, such as a base station, through such hotspots. We propose a semi-distributed algorithm, referred to as coordinated cognitive tethering (CCT), which clusters all nodes and coordinates hotspots to tether over locally available white spaces. CCT performs the following these steps: (a) groups nodes based on a modified k-means clustering algorithm; (b) assigns white-space spectrum to each cluster based on a distributed graph-coloring approach to maximize spectrum reuse, and (c) allocates physical-layer resources to individual users based on local channel information. Unlike small cells (for example, femtocells and WiFi), this approach does not require any additions to existing infrastructure. In addition to providing parallel service to more users than conventional direct communication in cellular networks, simulation results show that CCT can increase the average battery life of devices by 30%, on average."

Based on this, Priest Yuanwu-keqin(圜悟克勤, 1063∼1225) made a book of lectures titled ‘Blue Cliff Record(碧巖錄)’. ‘the versified comments for kōan by Xuedou’ began to be read since the Goryeo Dynasty, but there has been no published records or remaining copy of the book. However, it became known that ‘the versified comments for kōan by Xuedou’ printed in wooden types during the reign of King Sejo in the Joseon Dynasty is owned by Horim Museum. Presumably, it is a duplicate copy of the book published in China in 1342 during the Yuan Dynasty. However, the name of publisher or the date of publication cannot be found due to the absence of imprint. The book only has a preface written by HuiChuan-fugui(惠川福珪) attached at the end of the book.National Library of China owns ‘Sagarok(四家錄)’, which includes ‘hongzhisonggo (宏智頌古)’, ‘xuedousonggo(雪竇頌古)’, ‘touzisonggo(投子頌古)’ and ‘danxiasonggo(丹霞頌古)’. ‘Sagarok’ was printed in Zhejiang Province in 1342, the same year that the Horim Museum edition was printed. ‘Sagarok’ was published by HaiDao(海島), HuiChuan-fugui and others. It means that HuiChuan-fugui was from Zhejiang Province in China. For ‘the versified comments for kōan by Xuedou’ included in ‘Sagarok’, HuiCong(慧從), not HuiChuan-fugui, wrote a preface. Thus, we can surmise that the edition of ‘the versified comments for kōan by Xuedou’ at National Library of China is different from the one at Horim Museum. While ‘Sagarok first edition’ is written on the National Library of China edition, the Horim Museum edition is noted to be ‘Sagarok revised edition’. In addition, ‘jijeongimosejungseo(至正壬午歲重書)’ is written after the preface by TanYu(曇玉) on the Horim Museum edition, but this wording is missing in the National Library of China edition. That is, HaiDao, HuiChuan-fugui and others published first edition of Sagarok in Zhejiang Province of China in 1342, and its revised edition in the same year with the preface by HuiChuan-fugui. Presumably, the Horim Museum edition is this revised edition of Sagarok brought into Joseon to be printed in wooden types. It is unknown who printed the revised edition of Sagarok with what purpose. During the early Joseon Dynasty, neither ‘Blue Cliff Record’ nor ‘the versified comments for kōan by Xuedou’ were popular, and they are likely to have been read by a few well-learned priests and classical scholars interested in Zen buddhism. Probably, wooden types were used to print only a small number of books."

No-reference Image Quality Assessment With A Gradient-induced Dictionary,2016,"['Image quality assessment', 'no-reference', 'dictionary', 'K-means clustering', 'SVM']",,"Image distortions are typically characterized by degradations of structures. Dictionaries learned from natural images can capture the underlying structures in images, which are important for image quality assessment (IQA). This paper presents a general-purpose no-reference image quality metric using a GRadient-Induced Dictionary (GRID). A dictionary is first constructed based on gradients of natural images using K-means clustering. Then image features are extracted using the dictionary based on Euclidean-norm coding and max-pooling. A distortion classification model and several distortion-specific quality regression models are trained using the support vector machine (SVM) by combining image features with distortion types and subjective scores, respectively. To evaluate the quality of a test image, the distortion classification model is used to determine the probabilities that the image belongs to different kinds of distortions, while the regression models are used to predict the corresponding distortion-specific quality scores. Finally, an overall quality score is computed as the probability-weighted distortion-specific quality scores. The proposed metric can evaluate image quality accurately and efficiently using a small dictionary. The performance of the proposed method is verified on public image quality databases. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric can generate quality scores highly consistent with human perception, and it outperforms the state-of-the-arts."

Our method adopts sub-pixel algorithm for extracting rising-edges and falling edges precisely and estimates the lane width and cycle by using k-means clustering algorithm. To handle the curved lanes, we partition the gel image into small portions, and track the lane centers in each partitioned image. 32 gel images including 534 lanes are used to evaluate the performance of our method. Experimental results show that our method is robust to images having background difference and bent lanes without any preprocessing."

Recent studies attempt to combine those two methods to maximize advantagesand to minimize disadvantages both of misuse and anomaly. The combination is called Hybrid IDS. Previous studies would not be inappropriate for near real-time network environments because they have computational complexity problems. It leads to the need of the study considering the structure of IDS that have high detection rate and low computational cost.

InŚlokavārttika, He asserts that the knowledge is not able to have itself as the object of cognition without another means of cognition. In other words, he denies the aspect of knowledge itself (svābhāsa) that is the grasping aspect (grāhakākāra) of knowledge in the two forms (dvirūpatā) of knowledge, the basic theory bringing into self-awareness theory of Yogacāra’s position of Dharmakīrti.In PV II 448-454, Dharmakīrtiexamines the cases that other means of cognition are required to cognize pleasure etc. and points out the irrationalities.According toDharmakīrti’s view, if there is another means of cognition for feeling pleasure, people should feel the feeling as much as what a person feels because each person can cognize personal feelings by another means of cognition. Mīmāṃsā says that though different person’s means of cognition has the same object of cognition, the personal pleasure etc. harmonizes with personal ātman, so that people cannot feelthe other’s feelings. Dharmakīrti also disagrees with this opinion because it is impossible that there are two different cognitions to the one object of cognition. He asserts that regardless of the coordination of the feelings and the personal ātman, there must be the same result: Other people cannot feel the same pleasure etc. thatbelongs to a person.To conclude, Dharmakīrti says another means of cognition to be aware of pleasure etc. is not necessary; that is, cognition itself grasps all psychological phenomenon, a kind of knowledge as the object of cognition.On the other hand, in Mīmāṃsā’s epistemology, the function of manas is a key word in the negation of self-awareness and introduction of the other means of cognition theory. Dharmakīrti, however, does not discuss the manas in the part of the cognition to pleasure etc. I infer it is related to Dharmakīrti limits on mānasapratyakṣaas the pratyakṣa to the cognition of being outside and svasaṃvedana as the pratyakṣa for the cognition of psychological phenomena."

Methods: The keratometry (K), axial length (AXL) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were measured using ultrasound biometry (USB) combined with auto-keratometry (Auto-K), parital coherence interferometry (PCI; IOL master？？) and dual Scheimpflug analyzer (DSA; Galilei？？) in 39 eyes of 39 patients. Predicted refraction was calculated using Auto-K, mean K of PCI, and simK and total corneal power (TCP) of DSA in the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK-T) formula. The SRK-II, SRK-T, Holladay II, Haigis, and Hoffer-Q formula were used to calculate predicted refraction with the simK of DSA and AXL of USB. Manifest refraction, mean numerical error (MNE) and mean absolute error were evaluated 1, 3 and 6 months after cataract surgery. Results: TCP of DSA was lower compared with other keratometric values (p 〈 0.05). The MNE was not different among Auto-K, mean K and simK. The MNE using TCP was larger compared with Auto-K, mean K and simK at 1 month after surgery (p 〈 0.05). There was a difference in MNE between simK and TCP of DSA at 6 months after surgery (p 〈 0.05). The MNE of SRK-T formula was the smallest in the intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation using the simK of DSA. Conclusions: We suggest using IOL power calculations with simK of DSA and SRK-T formula rather than TCP of DSA in cataract patients with normal corneas."

Methods: A retrospective study was performed in 316 eyes of 160 subjects. Subjects were divided into 3 groups according to age. Group 1 was younger than 10 years, group 2 was older than 10 years and younger than 18 years, and group 3 was older than 18 years. Subjects were tested using the Lenstar LS900®, KR-8100®, and Medmont E300®. Comparisons were made for steep K, flat K, mean K, and astigmatism among three groups. Agreement among the 3 devices was examined using the Bland-Altman method. Results: The keratometry measured by Medmont E300® was highest, followed by that of Lenstar LS900® and KR-8100® in all 3 groups. Almost all keratometry was significantly different among the 3 devices except for the flat K measured by LS900® and KR-8100® in all 3 groups and flat K measured by KR-8100® and Medmont E300® in Group 3 (p 〈 0.05).

The agreement between KR-8100® and Medmont E300® was worse than that between the other two pairs in Groups 1 and 3, while the agreement between Lenstar LS900® and Medmont E300® was worse in Group 2. Conclusions: There were significant differences in keratometry among the 3 devices in all 3 groups. In children, Medmont E300® showed relatively less agreement compared with the other two devices. In adults, however, the agreement between 2 devices showed variable results. Consideration of the keratometry measurement from Lenstar LS900®, KR-8100®, and Medmont E300® might be helpful to estimate accurate corneal keratometry in children.

He argued ‘Moglichketistheorie’ as a theory that can most exactly explain the meaning of article 16 of Korean penal code, originally introduced by M. E. Mayer, a renowned german legal professor. Unlike Paul. K. Ryu’s opinion, many other legal scholars prefer ‘Schuldtheorie’ to ‘Moglichketistheorie’ as a theoretical background of article 16 of Korean penal code. However, as I refuted in this paper, ‘Schuldtheorie’ is not the right theory but just one of the candidate theory which can give us an accurate explanation of the meaning of article 16. From the view of memetics, we can conjecture an identification of Paul. K. Ryu as a legal professor and his book ‘Strafrecht AT’. His academic attitude seems to be oriented toward defending the principle of criminal liability as well as the meaning of positive law and pursuing theoretical interpretational integrity. In memory of Paul. K. Ryu’s academic attitude, I argued ‘Moglichketis heorie’ as the best theory that can be congruent with the meaning of article 16."
이효석 초기 소설 연구: 일본 쇼와 문학과의 연관성을 중심으로,2016,"['Yi Hyosŏk', 'Ryūtanji Yū', 'Japanese Shōwa literature', 'Korean modern literature', 'Ero-gro-nonsense', 'Proletarian literature.', '이효석', '초기 소설', '동반자 작가', '류탄지 유', '난센스 문학', '쇼와 초기 문학.']","이 논문은 이효석 초기 소설을 일본 근대문학과의 관계 내에서 고찰하여 그 특징과 문학사적 의의를 밝히는 데에 목적이 있다. 이효석 문학의 전기(前期)는 1928-1932년으로 설정할 수 있으며, 그 시기의 효석 문학은 중·후기의 문학과는 다른 특징을 보인다. 이효석 초기 문학의 특징은 크게 ‘도시’, ‘동반자 문학’, ‘엑조티시즘’의 세 가지로 나뉜다. 이 중 본고에서는 도시의 ‘모던’과 동반자문학적 ‘경향성’이 상충하는 지점을 중심으로, 이효석 초기 소설의 양면적 성격의 진실은 무엇인지 해명하고자 하였다. 이를 위해 효석과 같은 시대에 비슷한 성향의 작품들을 발표한 일본 작가 류탄지 유(龍膽寺雄)의 경우를 함께 살펴보았다. 효석과 류탄지의 초기소설의 공통점은 당대에 정반대의 항으로 여겨졌던 부르주아적 도시문화와 프롤레타리아적 소재가 작품 안에서 공존한다는 것이다. 이러한 특징은 연구자들에 의해 작품세계의 가벼움이나 모순을 품은 미숙함 등으로 치부되어 온 경향이 있으나, 효석과 류탄지가 몸담고 있던 쇼와(昭和)기 문단의 상황을 살펴보았을 때, 모더니스트 예술과 사회주의 예술이 서로 대척했던 것은 분명하나 사실은 문학사적으로 그들의 사상적 배경이나 작품의 소재에 교집합이 있었다는 것을 알 수 있다. 인식과 소재의 공유를 바탕으로 쇼와기 문인들은 헤게모니적 경합을 벌이고 있었으며, 이러한 ‘공존의 난센스’는 류탄지 유와 이효석 문학에도 적용된다. 따라서 그들 작품의 양면성은 시대성을 짙게 반영하는 독특성으로 해석되어야 할 것이다. 더불어 이효석의 초기 소설이 일본 쇼와 문학과 밀접한 관련이 있으며, 효석 문학은 초기 작품을 비롯하여 언제나 예민한 시대적 감각을 지니고 있다는 점을 확인할 수 있다. 이효석은 그의 문학세계 전체를 지탱하는 심미주의와 세계주의를 중심으로 독자성을 흔들림 없이 유지하면서도 매순간 시대의 변화에 민감한 센스를 발휘하여 이야기에 화려한 옷을 입혔다. 여기에서 우리는 효석문학의 또 다른 가치와 의의를 한 번 더 발견하게 된다.","The purpose of this paper is to clarify the feature of Yi Hyosŏk’s early works through comparison with Ryūtanji Yū’s literature. The early stage of Yi’s literature when is from 1928 to 1932 has three different themes; urbanism, socialism, exoticism. Among these three concepts, this essay dealt with urbanism and socialism which contradict each other and tried to figure out what this ambivalence mean.Ryūtanji is a Japanese writer who shares same era and similar literary style with Yi. Both of Yi and Ryūtanji’s early works contain bourgeois modern culture and proletarian context at the same time. This singularity of their literature has been regarded as a contradiction or immaturity. However, when it comes to Shōwa period, it is true that modernist art and socialist art contradicted each other, but they had common ground in their ideological foundation. Artists of Shōwa competed for hegemony sharing perception and subject matter, and this ‘nonsense’ of sharing and coexistence is also applied to works of Ryūtanji and Yi. Therefore, the ambivalence of Ryūtanji and Yi’s works should be understood as a uniqueness reflecting the trend of the time. Furthermore, it was revealed that Yi’s early works are closely related to Japanese Shōwa literature and his literature has a sharp sense of the time.As already known, Yi Hyosŏk kept artistic identity and originality with solid main ideas of his literary world which are aestheticism and cosmopolitanism. Besides, at the same time, his sense of trend created splendid scenes in his stories. This could be counted as a value and significance of Yi Hyosŏk’s literature."
Centrality dependence of subthresholdϕmeson production in Ni + Ni collisions at1.9AGeV,2016,,,"<P>We analyzed the phi meson production in central Ni + Ni collisions at a beam kinetic energy of 1.93A GeV with the FOPI spectrometer and found a production probability per event of [8.6 +/- 1.6(stat) +/- 1.5(syst)] x 10(-4). This new data point allows us for the first time to inspect the centrality dependence of subthreshold phi meson production in heavy-ion collisions. The rise of phi meson multiplicity per event with mean number of participants can be parametrized by a power function with exponent alpha = 1.8 +/- 0.6. The ratio of phi to K- production yields seems not to depend, within the experimental uncertainties, on the collision centrality, and the average of measured values was found to be 0.36 +/- 0.05.</P>"

For this current study, 57 listed companies that revaluated their assets in 2009 were selected and the indices such as return on equity(ROE), return on asset(ROA) and Debt-Equity ratio in 2009 were compared with those after 2009.  It has been observed from empirical study that the indices improved due to the asset revaluation. However, these improvements are not further improved nor maintained at the same level as time elapsed after the asset revaluation. Furthermore, these indices were regressed to the level prior to the asset revaluation. This result indicates that the asset revaluation from fair-valuation option, far from enhancing the quality of accounting information, are exploited as opportunism.  This study suggests that the asset revaluation did not serve the intended improvements expected from the asset revaluation based on K-IFRS and provides evidence that it further degrades the quality of accounting information due to management abuse of the revaluation. Thus the discretion is needed when the fair value accounting system is introduced. Also, another significant finding of the current study is that the improvement as a result of the revaluation is only temporary illusions and the discretion is needed when translating the meaning of the revaluation."

Estimation of Suitable Methodology for Determining Weibull Parameters for the Vortex Shedding Analysis of Synovial Fluid,2016,"['Weibull distribution', 'vortex shedding', 'synovial fluid', 'least square estimation method', 'maximum likelihood estimator', 'method of moment']",,"Weibull distribution with two parameters, shape (k) and scale (s) parameters are used to model the fatigue failure analysis due to periodic vortex shedding of the synovial fluid in knee joints. In order to determine the later parameter, a suitable statistical model is required for velocity distribution of synovial fluid flow. Hence, wide applicability of Weibull distribution in life testing and reliability analysis can be applied to describe the probability distribution of synovial fluid flow velocity. In this work, comparisons of three most widely used methods for estimating Weibull parameters are carried out; i.e. the least square estimation method (LSEM), maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the method of moment (MOM), to study fatigue failure of bone joint due to periodic vortex shedding of synovial fluid. The performances of these methods are compared through the analysis of computer generated synovial fluidflow velocity distribution in the physiological range. Significant values for the (k) and (s) parameters are obtained by comparing these methods. The criterions such as root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination ($R^2$), maximum error between the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) or Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and the chi square tests are used for the comparison of the suitability of these methods. The results show that maximum likelihood method performs well for most of the cases studied and hence recommended."

Our ZF-μSR spectra of CeRu2Ga2B with a Curie temperature at TC = 16.3 K show a well-defined muon procession at temperatures below TC. The extracted critical exponent of  = 0.533 is close to the mean-field value of  = 0.5. On the other hand, the isomorphic CeRu2Al2B exhibits an intriguing evolution of the ZF-μSR spectrum through a spin density wave/ferromagnetic transition at TC = 12.8 K with a subsequent magnetic anomaly at T = 6 K. Strikingly, the muon frequency decreases upon cooling to temperatures below TC and can be no longer resolved at temperatures below T. At the same time, the muon relaxation rate increases continuously at temperatures below TC. These give an indication of the development of an inhomogeneous and dynamic ferromagnetic state. The contrasting ferromagnetism between CeRu2Ga2B and CeRu2Al2B evidences that a certain type of intrinsic/extrinsic perturbation, for example, exchange frustration and defects/impurities, can exert a drastic impact on the local magnetic properties in a family of 4f-localized magnetic materials with frustration."

This means going to the world with the good contents and differentiation not with the supports of Korean wave in the background. Publication is a source contents of which quintessence of culture is accumulated. Thus, conceptual shift is needed to better utilize the contents of publications from multiple angle.  China is the best customer who imports Korea’s book contents most. It has been importing various fields of contents in child, practical, science and technology, literature and academics. However, there is limitation to continue the exchanges from Beijing International Book Fair or Seoul International Book Fair as they are held once in a year. New method is sought beyond the current route which is heavily dependant on Chinese professional agencies for import and export the copyright. It is time to find a news business model to seek and visit more actively. That is ‘Visiting Book Fair in China’. Publication business in Korea-China is stagnated in Stage 1 at the moment. First of all, ‘Visiting Book Fair’ plays a platform role to create practical profits through copyright imports and exports. More advanced collaborated model has to be made in Stage 2 through collaborated contents development and production. Macroscopic business model should be introduced in Stage 3 including acquisition and collaboration between publishing companies, branch building, or copyright center establishment. The connecting link between stages is ‘Visiting Book Fair’.  Korea and China officially signed a Free Trade Agreement and business are going to be operated in a new economic angle. Korea-China FTA is an opportunity as well as a crisis. In such a complex environment, more active attitude is required to get an opportunity instead of a crisis. As a result, ‘Visiting Book Fair’ is to solve such a difficult situation."
A computational study of DME-methanol fractions with controlling several factors on HCCI combustion,2016,"['Homogeneous charge compression ignition', 'Indicated mean effective pressure', 'Pressure rise rate', 'Combustion ranges', 'Reaction mechanism']",,"Two-stage fuel and single stage fuel have different effects on ignition delay and other combustion characteristics. If we mix two fuels with variable fractions, combustion characteristics will be represented with dependence on the fraction. We first investigated the change of combustion characteristics and combustion ranges by dimethyl ether (DME)/methanol fraction, IVC temperature and IVC pressure.By increasing methanol fraction, Heat release rate (HRR) showed higher rate than the case containing less methanol after 1250 K. However, it didn't mean that Accumulated heat release (AHR) was also higher than the cases which contained less methanol. AHR of D90/M10 was the first case which surpassed AHR of D100 at about 1808K, and D80/M20 surpassed D100 at about 2318K. The result was caused by change of reaction mechanism and the change was remarkably shown in the Thermal ignition preparation (TIP) range and the Thermal ignition (TI) range. Above all, strengthened H 2 O 2 Loop reactions affected heat production to increase in TIP range, and also one of the loop reactions, CH 2 O + OH = HCO + H 2 O, quickly produced formyl radical with increase of net reaction rate by methanol.Those results naturally led to higher reaction rates of HCO-CO-CO 2 oxidation with higher heat production. As a result, D50/M50 case showed the highest maximum Pressure rise rate (PRR). Furthermore, dispersion rate of PRR was increased by increasing methanol fraction in the range which was from back end of TIP to forepart of TI range. Finally, we focused the reaction paths of two fuels and the production and consumption rate of main radicals on the basis of combustion ranges such as LTO, Negative temperature coefficient (NTC), Thermal ignition preparation (TIP) and Thermal ignition (TI) to understand the results of this study."

"Highly potent tyrosinase inhibitor, neorauflavane from Campylotropis hirtella and inhibitory mechanism with molecular docking",2016,,,"<P>Tyrosinase inhibition may be a means to alleviate not only skin hyperpigmentation but also neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease. In the course of metabolite analysis from tyrosinase inhibitory methanol extract (80% inhibition at 20 mu g/ml) of Campylotropis hirtella, we isolated fourteen phenolic compounds, among which neorauflavane 3 emerged as a lead structure for tyrosinase inhibition. Neorauflavane 3 inhibited tyrosinase monophenolase activity with an IC50 of 30 nM. Thus this compound is 400-fold more active than kojic acid. It also inhibited diphenolase (IC50 = 500 nM), significantly. Another potent inhibitor 1 (IC50 = 2.9 mu M) was found to be the most abundant metabolite in C. hirtella. In kinetic studies, compounds 3 showed competitive inhibitory behavior against both monophenolase and diphenolase. It manifested simple reversible slow-binding inhibition against monophenolase with the following kinetic parameters: K-i(app) = 1.48 nM, k(3) = 0.0033 nM (1) min (1) and k(4) = 0.0049 min (1). Neorauflavane 3 efficiently reduced melanin content in B16 melanoma cells with 12.95 mu M of IC50. To develop a pharmacophore model, we explored the binding mode of neuroflavane 3 in the active site of tyrosinase. Docking results show that resorcinol motif of B-ring and methoxy group in A-ring play crucial roles in the binding the enzyme. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</P>"
Accuracy of Korean-Mini-Mental Status Examination Based on Seoul Neuro-Psychological Screening Battery II Results,2016,"['Korean-Mini-Mental Status Examination', 'Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery-II', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Negative Predictive Value', 'False Positive', 'False Negative']",,"Background: The Korean-Mini-Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE) is a dementia-screening test that can beeasily applied in both community and clinical settings. However, in 20% to 30% of cases, the K-MMSE produces afalse negative response. This suggests that it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of K-MMSE as a screening test fordementia, which can be achieved through comparison of K-MMSE and Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery(SNSB)-II results.Methods: The study included 713 subjects (male 534, female 179; mean age, 69.3±6.9 years). All subjects were assessedusing K-MMSE and SNSB-II tests, the results of which were divided into normal and abnormal in 15 percentilestandards.Results: The sensitivity of the K-MMSE was 48.7%, with a specificity of 89.9%. The incidence of false positive andnegative results totaled 10.1% and 51.2%, respectively. In addition, the positive predictive value of the K-MMSE was87.1%, while the negative predictive value was 55.6%. The false-negative group showed cognitive impairments inregions of memory and executive function. Subsequently, in the false-positive group, subjects demonstrated reducedperformance in memory recall, time orientation, attention, and calculation of K-MMSE items.Conclusion: The results obtained in the study suggest that cognitive function might still be impaired even if an individualobtained a normal score on the K-MMSE. If the K-MMSE is combined with tests of memory or executivefunction, the accuracy of dementia diagnosis could be greatly improved."

The effect of copper substitution for nickel on the electrical and electrochemical properties was examined. Small amount of copper doping (x=0.2) resulted in the increased electrical conductivity and decreased polarization resistance. It appears that this phenomenon was associated with the high mean valence of nickel and copper and the resulting excess oxygen (delta). It was found that power densities of the cell with the Nd2Ni1-xCuxO4+delta (x=0.1 and 0.2) cathode were higher than that of the cell with the Nd2NiO4+delta cathode.</P>"

Standardized Regression Based(SRB) Model was utilized to detect cognitive decliner controlling regression to mean, practice effect and measurement error. The main results were as follows. First, the illiterate performed poorly on all area of cognitive function including attention, initiation/perseveration, construction, conceptualization and memory than the literate. Second, age-related cognitive change was faster in the illiterate than the literate in all cognitive areas in cross-sectional analysis. Third, the rate of cognitive decliner was about five times higher in the illiterate than the literate group, and the odds ratio of the illiterate was 3.62. These results suggested that lack of reserve, measured by literacy, may have negative influence on normal cognitive aging as well as dementia.

The value of culture is estimated to be getting higher every year and the overall reputation of Korean culture including K-Drama, K-pop, K-fashion is increasing. The cultural component in the design is also becoming important. Accordingly, a development of product design reinterpreted in a modern way from the traditional cultural ingredient would contribute to the industrialization of Korean culture. The thesis contains the design to make scarves and neckties by applying traditional Jogakbo which was a typical method in Joseon Dynasty. The Jogakbo is a representative Korean culture and has a tremendous potential for expression. It has been used already by Karl Lagerfeld in Chanel Cruise Collection in 2015-16. The artwork mainly includes women s normal square shape scarf for middle aged women, twilly scarf for young customers and neckties for men. These artworks can be used not only as each piece but also a combination set of scarf and necktie. After analyzing the detailed structure of traditional Jogakbo, 3 main components were selected and applied to the design. All artworks were produced with digital printing methods which can express effectively various colors and textures and also are appropriate for small-quantity production. Conversion of hand crafts to digital printing for custom production increases the competitiveness as a cultural product. Fashion products reflecting the traditional culture are important because of the culture’s meaning and value. But a unique and differentiated design by reinterpreting the traditional value in modern way would add to its value more. I hope this project contribute to the improvement of Korean production industry."

By doing so, it is to offer guidance for its design. For this research three normal persons took part in the experiment. Results are as follows. First, upper limb torque was found to be the highest at 50 degree of a back and muscle endurance was shown to be the highest at 80 degree of a back. It means that as a back of a chair gets lower the speed and efficiency becomes better, which contradicts the subjective fact that K-type hand bikes would show the highest speed. Second, among types of grips of hand bikes 45 degree ones have been shown to be the ones with the highest torque. This is due to proper distribution of power of joints in arms, elbows, and shoulders. Third, in case of distance of 45cm between crank axis and chest, it has shown the most efficient torque. This is because of the effect of gravity and exhaustion when handling."

In addition to that, ‘Go’ is added to brand name implying that bibigo takes the lead in global food industry. Eventually the name of ‘bibigo’ means its marketing strategy which is to pursue a blend of domestic and foreign and dining and processed foods.  The purpose of this case is to introduce bibigo’s successful marketing strategies. To fulfill this purpose, we looked into bibigo brand strategy and global expansion strategies focusing on brand concept, product portfolio, integrated marketing communication and global expansion strategies on the basis of academic theory, and then discussed the future challenges for bibigo."
The Relationship Between the Formation of Clusters Containing Tetrahedral Molecules and the Dynamic and Thermodynamic Anomalies of Cooled TIP4P/2005 Water,2016,"['TIP4P/2005 water', 'Tetrahedral molecules', 'Anomalous properties', 'MD simulation']",,"Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to cool the simple liquid TPI4P/2005 water at 350 K to 100 K. We find that structural changes of the system cause dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies. A strong increase in the number of tetrahedral oxygen atoms and combinations of these atoms lead to water’s a phase transition from a simple liquid form into a supercooled one or ice at TI = 200 K. In the initial stage, small patches containing tetrahedral oxygen atoms connect together to yield large clusters. The rapid drop in the number of clusters and the speedy growth in the size of the largest cluster lead to water’s exhibiting anomalously dynamic behaviors at temperatures around 279 K. Our results also show that water is very stable in its supercooled or ice state, exhibiting no change in the mean squared displacement, light oscillation in the number of the clusters and in the size of the largest cluster."

Parent's behavior assessment analyzed parent's responsiveness with reactive behavior, effective behavior, directive behavior. According to the result of the research, first of all, there has been a positive change in terms of relation between parents and infant, teacher and infant, and parents and teacher. In parent-infant behavior analysis, it was able to understand parent's parenting attitude, help and understand infant attitude developed based on this, and by supporting parenting skills through counseling parents, parents-infant-teacher were able to cooperate in behavior instruction. Second, rather than solving problems in a short-term way, by means of the analysis of observation through K-MBRS, it was able to support infant to overcome difficulty in kindergarten life, and therefore grow into optimistic and healthy infant. by supporting high qualified interaction in relationship between parents and infant, teacher and infant, along with the settled emotional support of parents and infant. Third, there have been qualitative changes in teachers, while in the process of analyzing parents and infant behavior. Teachers became to do reflective thinking through the process of analyzing parent-infant interaction assessment and through parent behavior instruction. This means that teachers became to do behavior instruction of themselves on their own by looking back themselves."

Compared with Kim Sŏng-tan(金聖歎)’s commentaries in his edition of Sŏsanggi, the writing style of the comments written by Chosŏn writers show three characteristics.  First, Chosŏn writers wrote their comments freely, with no restriction of material, issue, and style. They also wrote jokes, including wordplay. It is possible for them to do like this, because they have no intention of publication. They just wrote a personal writing.  Second, Chosŏn writers often tried to find connection between work contents and the real world. They showed their opinions about the real life of their own.  Third, Chosŏn writers pursued conversational criticism. In some comments, they talked to the characters in the works, and talked to the readers to have them laugh with jokes not to teach them with an explanation. This kind of attitude is far different from that of Kim Sŏng-tan who tried to pass on his interpretation of the work to the readers in an authoritative voice, as if it had been the only right interpretation."

한의대생의 휴학경험에 관한 현상학적 연구,2016,"['Korean Medicine Students', 'Stop-out', 'Qualitative research']",,"Objectives : This study was to identify the stop-out experiences of Korean Medicine Students(K.M.S.). The stop-out is defined as a withdrawal temporarily from enrollment at a university. Methods : Data was collected through in-depth individual interviews from 2013 to 2016 and analyzed with Colaizzi's phenomenological methodology. The participants were interviewed once or twice, for 30minutes to 50minutes per interview. Results : Ten theme-clusters were identified from 21 themes. These theme-clusters were divided to 4 divisions as when they made the decision for the stop-out, during their stop-out period, when they went back to school and the meaning of their stop-out. 'A difficult situation to continue the study', 'Uncertainty about their decision and anxiety of the future' are 2 theme-clusters for when they made the decision for the stop-out, 'Conflict and anxiety', 'Novel and free time', 'Improving family relationship and finding new relationship' are 3 theme-clusters for during their stop-out period, 'Anxiety for the returning to school', 'New relationship and sense of relief' are 2 theme-clusters for when they went back to school, and 'Making a present for me', 'An opportunity for the emotional growth', 'Recovery of learning will' are 3 theme-clusters for the meaning of their stop-out that they gave to it. Conclusions : The stop - out of K.M.S. began at the hope that they want to take the lead for their lives. And they would find themselves more mature after the experience of their stop-out. This result could be a basic reference for the counselling of the faculty working with K.M.S."

Darumauta means that the conservative poetical circles compared the progressive poetry style of Mikohidari Family(御子左家) to a newly-risen religion, Dhrma Order of Buddhism which was harshly criticized. It means a nonsense poem a pejorative term for Zen. It seems that this term was coined in connection with the Zen kōan’s ‘critical phrases’ that seemed like unintelligible riddles to ordinary people and other Buddhist schools. This term was used by conservative waka poets to refer to the innovative style of Fujiwara no Teika. Nevertheless, at that time the conservative poetical circles didn’t understand about Yozyo(余情) and Yoen(妖艶) which compiled in part of aesthetic sense by Teika. So they disparaged Teika’s new thoughts as Darumauta. However Darumauta broke away from the traditional style that kept old way of thinking. Teika’s Darumauta is a device of zeitgeist and made stereotyped phrases express discourse of language. Therefore, the essence of Darumauta is a conversion of poetic language and idea which aims for Ushin(有心). it works a new poetic turn of mind in the whole progress of the second Yozyou(余情) and Yoen(妖艶)."

Intangible asset has a high level of audit risk compared to other asset because intangible asset is invisible and satisfy strict definitions to be recognized in the financial statement.The results of this study are as follow. Intangible asset increases audit hour and audit fee compared to PPE. This results means that auditor increases audit risk of intangible asset because of invisibility of intangible asset and judging of identifiability. Furthermore, intangible asset is more related to audit effort after the adoption of K-IFRS. It is because K-IFRS requires the different accounting treatment of intangible asset such as no depreciation but testing impairment of goodwill while K-GAAP requires depreciation under 20 years. Finally, big accounting firm who has a more interest in reputation effect than local accounting firm put more effort in auditing intangible asset.This study finds the auditor’s respond to the audit risk by employing intangible asset. This results contributes that audit risk related to intangible asset is offset by auditor’s effort that auditor’s due care increases the reliability of the financial statement."

Activation energies and reaction orders of the samples were determined by different methods such as Kissinger, Freeman-Carroll, Chatterjee-Conrad, Friedman and Coats-Redfern methods. Various methods were compared with regard to their accuracy and the ease of interpretation of the kinetics of thermal decomposition. It was found that the apparent activation energies of the thermal processes were different with variation of analytical methods and experimental conditions. The apparent activation energy of combustion in the atmosphere (12.22~81.69 KJ/㏖) was lower than that of pyrolysis in the atmosphere (45.94~92.94 KJ/㏖)."

It was named “first nature” and assessed as a living space unable to provide adequate living conditions for people. This attitude created a pre-requisite for forming a radical technocratic stand with a focal demand to create a “second nature”,that is the nature that would be constructed by people by means of science and technology. Based on that stand, there emerged a number of projects, utopian in character, seeking to change man’s natural living environment. Their authors perceived the structure of the earth and outer space as a simple mechanical arrangement thatcould be improved by man.Writers of various ideological and artistic platforms took part in the discussion on improvement of people’s natural living environment. Leaders of the discussion were writers of the proletarian and later industrial subjects (in particular, M. Gorky, A.Platonov, proletarian poets) and representatives of “scientific poetry”. Even peasant writers sympathized with the idea of radical change of nature.Projects on the rebuild of nature were proposed in works of fiction, scientific treatise and publicist essays. A desire to overcome hunger, poverty, inconveniencies of landscape and climate was the driving motivation for authors of such projects.

He borrows a considerable number of terms from other science without entering into a discussion about their precise meanings, thus leaving us to formulate the concepts behind these terms. Wordclass categories are usually defined by enumeration. Other grammatical categories may be defined on purely formal grounds, or again by enumeration.  Patan͂jali’s Mahābhāṣya on P 1.3.1 “bhūvadayo dhātavaḥ” discusses definitional, practical, and philosophical issues raised by the notion of a verbal root (dhātu). Already before Patanjali, Kātyāyana’s Vārttikas indicate that this rule and the notion of a verbal root had become a subject of debates and disputes, and one sees reflections of some of these debates also in Yāska’s Nirukta. This study presents a detailed account of these early debates and disputes, mostly as seen in Patan͂jali’s Mahābhāṣya, but also as seen in Bhartṛhari’s and Kaiyaṭa’s work.  Among the important topics covered in this study are the various alternative definitions proposed for the notion of a verbal root, namely a list-based definition as seen in P. 1.3.1, a kriyā-based definition, and a bhāva-based definition. If a root is defined as a signifier of kriyā, then how does one deal with roots like √bhū and √as, that seem to denote a state? If a root is defined as a signifier of bhāva, then how does one deal with roots like √kṛ that denote a kriyā? Patan͂jali argues that even the root √as denotes a kriyā. For that reason Patan͂jali introduces the notion of bhāva “becoming” recited in the Nirukta. that embraces genesis, existence, alteration, growth, decay, and destruction. However, he rewrites bhāva vs. sattva into kriyā vs. dravya, because the meaning of bhāva of the time has been changed from ‘becoming’ to ‘being.’ This strategy resulted in the unintended consequences, that is, the metaphysical turning point from the becoming-dominant to the being-dominant."

Kirchlichkeit is the religious normativity of european culture. This concept is a event of intertextual understanding of religious and historical theology by semler, schleiermacher und of church dogmatics by k. barth. With this concept explains he, that his social ethics comes from hermeneutical theology and refers to the hermeneutical dogmatics and ethics. He tries to explain practical “kirchlichkeit”. What is practical “kirchlichkeit”? First, he regards “Kirchlichkeit” as identity. Man expresses with freedom identity and develops faith community. “Setting in Life” of christian faith is a historical and modern kontext, where church and theology the whole life of christian form. Rendtorff regards interpretation of “Setting in Life” of religious life the task of theology. Second, he defines “Kirchlichkeit” as individuality of christian faith in the european religious history and european culture. Theology is hermeneutics as localization in relation to churches dogmatics by karl barth. Here is church a room, where Gott appears as trinity. The subject of church is not mensch, but god. If god appears in the church, understands christian god as the basis of identity of christian faith. Church is a dogmatic form of freedom in society. Third is “Kirchlichkeit” the basis of social ethics. Because social ethics makes religious society with various forms to social body. It is a matter of political theology. Trutz Rendtorff emphasizes living together, mutual cognition, compromise, dissent care in public life, in order to reach consensus. Rendtorff emphasizes the interpretation of religious text and traditions and dialogue with other religions. This is a meaning of social ethics as perform of life. Finally has social ethics the formation of identity and Kirchlichkeit as task of korean theology. In the political situation of korea must develops the korean theology the method of dialogue between christianity and other religions for social responsibility."

It was named “first nature” and assessed as a living space unable to provide adequate living conditions for people. This attitude created a pre-requisite for forming a radical technocratic stand with a focal demand to create a “second nature”, that is the nature that would be constructed by people by means of science and technology. Based on that stand, there emerged a number of projects, utopian in character, seeking to change man’s natural living environment. Their authors perceived the structure of the earth and outer space as a simple mechanical arrangement that could be improved by man.Writers of various ideological and artistic platforms took part in the discussion on improvement of people’s natural living environment. Leaders of the discussion were writers of the proletarian and later industrial subjects (in particular, M. Gorky, A. Platonov, proletarian poets) and representatives of “scientific poetry”. Even peasant writers sympathized with the idea of radical change of nature.Projects on the rebuild of nature were proposed in works of fiction, scientific treatise and publicist essays. A desire to overcome hunger, poverty, inconveniencies of landscape and climate was the driving motivation for authors of such projects.

Liquid velocity, gas holdup and solid holdup distributions in the agitated tank were obtained. The effect of operating conditions on gas and solid distributions was investigated. The predicted flow pattern was compared with results in literature. The simulation results indicate that local hydrodynamic behaviors such as velocity, gas and solid holdup distribution, are strongly influenced by operating conditions. Within the scope of our study, increasing gas inlet rate caused liquid circulation to be weakened and was not in favor of gas dispersion. Solid holdup in the upper part of the tank, especially near the wall region decreased. Adding solid loadings resulted in liquid mean velocity near the surface region decreased, gas dispersion and solid suspension becoming worse."

Is there a stratospheric radiative feedback in global warming simulations?,2016,,,"<P>The radiative impacts of the stratosphere in global warming simulations are investigated using abrupt CO2 quadrupling experiments of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), with a focus on stratospheric temperature and water vapor. It is found that the stratospheric temperature change has a robust bullhorn-like zonal-mean pattern due to a strengthening of the stratospheric overturning circulation. This temperature change modifies the zonal mean top-of-the-atmosphere energy balance, but the compensation of the regional effects leads to an insignificant global-mean radiative feedback (-0.02 +/- 0.04 W m(-2) K-1). The stratospheric water vapor concentration generally increases, which leads to a weak positive global-mean radiative feedback (0.02 +/- 0.01 W m(-2) K-1). The stratospheric moistening is related to mixing of elevated upper-tropospheric humidity, and, to a lesser extent, to change in tropical tropopause temperature. Our results indicate that the strength of the stratospheric water vapor feedback is noticeably larger in high-top models than in low-top ones. The results here indicate that although its radiative impact as a forcing adjustment is significant, the stratosphere makes a minor contribution to the overall climate feedback in CMIP5 models.</P>"

METHODS: Seventy-eight subjects (14 men, 64 women) with KOA, between the ages of 41 and 83 years (mean age, 61.29 years), were included. All the subjects diagnosed with KOA were scored for severity of radiographic KOA according to the Kellgren-Lawrence (K/L) grade, visual analogue scale (VAS), knee joint range of motion (ROM), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), maximum muscle power (MMP), and sit-to-stand (STS) and one-leg standing (OLS) tests. Associations among the K/L grade, diagnosis, pain, and function were examined by correlation analysis. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the K/L grade, and the VAS, STS test time, and WOMAC scores (p>.05). There were no significant differences between the K/L grade, bilateral ROM, MMP, and left OLS test time (p>.05). However, there was a significant difference between the K/L grade and right OLS test time (p<.05). The K/L grade was negatively correlated with the left OLS test time(r=-.24, p<.05) and with the right OLS test time (r=-.307, p<.01). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that radiographic KOA was not associated with pain, knee MMP, ROM, and STS test time, but had a weak negative correlation with OLS test time."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility and validity of the Korean version of the FRAIL (K-FRAIL) scale. Methods: Questionnaire items were translated and administered to 103 patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. In this cross-sectional study, the K-FRAIL scale was compared with the domains and the multidimensional frailty index of the comprehensive geriatric assessment. We also assessed the time required to complete the scale. Results: The participants’ mean age was 76.8 years (standard deviation [SD], 6.1), and 55 (53.4%) were males. The mean overall frailty index was 0.19 (SD, 0.17). For K-FRAIL-robust, prefrail, and frail patients, the mean frailty indices were 0.09, 0.18, and 0.34, respectively (p for trend < 0.001). A higher degree of impairment in the K-FRAIL scale was associated with worse nutritional status, poor physical performance, functional dependence, and polypharmacy. The number of items with impairment in the K-FRAIL scale was positively associated with the frailty index (B = 3.73, p < 0.001). The K-FRAIL scale could differentiate vulnerability from robustness with a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.33. Of all patients, 75 (72.8%) completed the K-FRAIL scale within < 3 minutes. Conclusions: The K-FRAIL scale is correlated with the frailty index and is a simple tool to screen for frailty in a clinical setting."

Comparing with theoretical models, the exponent values obtained in our work are quite close to those expected from mean-field theory (with beta = 0.5, gamma = 1, and delta = 3). This reveals nearly long-range ferromagnetic order existing in (La0.9Dy0.1)(0.8) Pb0.2MnO3. From the M(H) data, we also found that, around the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase-transition temperature (T (C)), the magnetic entropy change reaches a maximum value (|delta S (max)|) of about 1.1 J kg(-1) K-1 for H = 10 kOe, corresponding to relative cooling power (RCP) of 50 J/kg. In addition to the above investigation, the temperature dependence of the magnetization, remanent magnetization (M (r)), and coercivity (H (c)) were recorded to learn about the physical processes taking place in (La0.9Dy0.1)(0.8)Pb0.2MnO3.</P>"
Investigation into factors influencing antioxidant capacity of vinegars,2016,"['Antioxidant capacity', 'Lipid oxidation inhibition', 'Polyphenols', 'Radical scavenging capacity', 'Vinegar']",,"Thirty commercial vinegars were investigated in order to study the factors influencing antioxidant capacity. Total phenols and flavonoids, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, and 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging capacity, nitrite scavenging capacity, reducing capacity, and lipid oxidation inhibition method were used. Factor and k-means cluster analysis partitioned the vinegars into three clusters according to antioxidant capacity. Traditional balsamic vinegar (TBV), balsamic vinegar, and tomato vinegar were grouped as cluster 2, which contained the highest antioxidant capacity. Especially, TBV exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity. In high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, cluster 2 also had a high content of polyphenols and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. These compounds presented positive correlation with the antioxidant capacity. The results suggested that polyphenols and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural were important factors influencing the antioxidant capacity of vinegars."
중소기업 CEO 이슈리더십과 기업성과 간의 관계에서 CEO 역량의 조절효과 검증,2016,"['CEO 이슈리더십', 'CEO 역량', '기업성과', '중소기업 CEO', '조직원의 인지', 'Issue Leadership of CEO', 'CEO Competency', 'Corporate Performance', 'SME CEO', 'Employees']","본 연구의 목적은 CEO 리더십이 기업성과에 미치는 영향을 규명하고 CEO 역량(유능함)의 조절효과를 실증적으로 검증하는 것이다. CEO 리더십은 현장 중심적이고 과업 중심적인 이슈리더십을 검증대상 리더십으로 선정하였고 CEO의 리더십이 미치는 영향이 상대적으로 큰 중소기업을 연구대상으로 하였다.  연구가설을 검증하기 위해 K은행을 거래하는 220개의 국내 중소기업을 선정한 후 CEO와 종업원 3명에게 설문조사를 실시하였고, 175개의 중소기업으로부터 설문지 회수 후 CEO용 또는 조직원용 설문지가 일부 누락된 기업, 불성실한 답변을 한 기업을 제외한 후, 총 153개의 중소기업을 분석대상으로 하였다. 설문은 단일 자료원에 따른 동일측정오류(common method bias)를 극복하기 위하여 독립변수와 조절변수, 종속변수에 대해 각기 다른 응답자가 응답하도록 설계하였다. 즉, 종속변수(주관적 재무성과)는 CEO가 응답하고, 독립변수(CEO 이슈리더십)와 조절변수(CEO 역량)는 조직원이 응답하게 하였다.  분석결과, CEO 이슈리더십이 기업의 주관적 재무성과에 정(+)의 영향을 미치는 것으로 나타났고, CEO의 이슈리더십이 기업성과에 미치는 영향은 CEO 역량(유능함)에 의해 조절됨이 확인되었다. 연구결과를 바탕으로 한 이론적 시사점과 실무적 시사점은 다음과 같다. 첫째, CEO의 리더십이 기업의 주관적인 재무성과에 영향을 미친다는 것을 최초로 확인할 수 있었으며, 중소기업 CEO가 현장에서 기업성과를 창출하기 위해서는 CEO이슈리더십이 필요함을 알 수 있었다. 둘째, 조직원들이 CEO의 유능함을 인지하면 CEO 이슈리더십과 기업성과의 긍정적인 관계가 더 강해짐을 최초로 검증하였다. 따라서 중소기업 CEO는 조직원들이 본인의 유능함을 인지할 수 있도록 조직적인 교육과정 이수와 스스로의 자기개발이 필요하다 하겠다.  끝으로, 본 연구의 한계와 향후 연구방향을 논의하였다.","The purpose of this research is to investigate how the CEO leadership effects the corporate performance and to objectively verify the moderating effect of CEO competency. For the study, issue leadership was selected as the verification subject for its field-centric and result driven tendencies and SMEs as research subjects, as they are more easily influenced by CEO leadership.  In order to verify the research hypothesis, 220 SMEs, all customers of K bank, were selected and conducted surveys on the CEO and 3 employees for each of them. Total of 175 SMEs responded, and the responses were then screened for completeness and validity. As a result, 153 SMEs qualified as subjects for further analysis. The survey was structured to prevent common method bias meaning that overlap in addressing independent variable, moderating variable and dependent variable within the survey was not allowed between participants. In short, dependent variable (subjective financial performance) were addressed by the CEO, independent variable (CEO issue leadership) and moderating variable (CEO competency) by participating employees.  In conclusion, the positive corelation between CEO issue leadership and corporate performance and the role of CEO competency as the moderating facto were verified for the first time (〈Table 1〉).  Practical and theoretical implications derived from this research are as follows. Firstly, effect of the CEO leadership on subjective corporate performance was verified, and the fact that his/her issue leadership was required for SMEs to enhance its performance. Secondly, the relationship between the CEO issue leadership and corporate performance was strengthened upon employees recognizing the his/her competency. Keeping this in mind, SME CEOs should focus more on self-development such as completing structured educational programs, etc.  [표본문참조]"
영국의 핀테크산업 규제에 관한 법적 고찰 - 인터넷전문은행과 P2P거래를 중심으로 -,2016,"['FinTech start-ups', 'FinTech industry', 'digital-only bank', 'P2P lending', 'internet-only bank', 'FinTech', '핀테크', '인터넷전문은행', 'P2P대출', '핀테크 창업기업', '핀테크 산업']","핀테크(Fintech)는 금융(Finance)와 기술(Technology)을 조합하여 만든 조어라고 할 수 있는데, 핀테크 산업이란 일반적으로 금융서비스를 제공하기 위한 소프트웨어의 활용에 기초한 사업의 분야라고 할 수 있다. 달리 표현하면, 금융시스템을 보다 효율적으로 만들기 위한 기술(technology)을 사용하는 회사로 구성된 산업이라고 할 수 있다.핀테크 산업은 송금, 결제, 금융데이터분석, 크라우드펀딩, P2P대출(Peer-to-peer Lending), 디지털 화폐, 사이버 보안, 자산관리, 신용평가 등을 포괄한다고 할 수 있다. 그리고 이러한 핀테크 산업을 선도하는 회사는 창업기업(startups)인 경우가 일반적이다.핀테크 산업에 대한 글로벌 투자 규모는 2008년 약 9억 달러에서 2013년 약 40억 달러로 세 배 이상 증가하였다. 더욱이 해가 갈수록 핀테크 산업에 대한 투자는 급증하고 있는 추세에 있다.핀테크 산업에 대한 투자를 선도하고 있는 대표적인 국가가 영국이라고 할 수 있는데, 영국 정부는 체계적인 핀테크 산업 육성정책을 수립하여 추진해 오고 있다. 런던에 소재하고 있는 유명한 핀테크 회사로는 FundingCircle, Nutmeg, TransferWise가 있는데, FundingCircle은 P2P대출업무, TransferWise는 국제송금업무, Nutmeg는 자산관리업무에 특화되어 있다.우리나라의 경우에도 최근 언론을 통해 핀테크 산업이 집중적인 조명을 받고 있을 뿐만 아니라 핀테크 산업이 우리의 일상생활에까지 큰 영향을 주고 있다. 예를 들면, 삼성페이, 카카오페이, 페이나우 등과 같이 휴대폰을 통해 소액결제가 이루어지는 방송광고가 눈에 띄게 증가하고 있다. 8퍼센트, 머니옥션 등과 같은 P2P 대출업체도 운영되고 있으며, 카카오 뱅크, 케이뱅크와 같은 인터넷전문은행이 설립되어 그 서비스 개시를 목전에 두고 있다.첫째, 영국의 인터넷전문은행은 기본적으로 기존 은행제도의 파괴적 혁신과 금융소비자의 편익 제고라는 관점에서 도입되어 운영되고 있다고 평가할 수 있다. 이러한 흐름을 고려하면 규제완화와 금융혁신의 관점에서 인터넷전문은행의 도입을 적극적으로 검토할 필요성이 있다고 생각된다. 다만 법적 논란을 잠재우기 위해서라도 은행법의 개정을 통해 인터넷전문은행을 도입하는 것이 바람직하다고 생각된다. 이와 함께 금융소비자보호방안이 마련되어야 한다. 인터넷전문은행은 향후 밀레니엄세대 내지 모바일세대의 은행으로 발전할 가능성이 높다고 본다.둘째, P2P대출의 경우 영국은 대부업법과 자본시장법의 양자의 적용을 통해 규제를 하고 있는 것처럼 보인다. P2P대출 분야 역시 핀테크 창업기업의 주요 활동무대라고 할 수 있다. 금융혁신을 고려하면 P2P대출의 활성화를 위한 규제완화입법이 필요하다고 생각된다. 이를 위한 방안으로는 자본시장법 개정 방안과 새로운 입법 방안을 검토할 수 있다고 본다.","Today financial services are largely provided through some form of technology. This technology makes financial services much more efficient and convenient. Financial services technology can, therefore, facilitate transactions without regard to the complex regulatory structure governing financial services. FinTech simply means financial technology. In addition, FinTech has already made huge inroads into many aspects of our daily lives.The birth and rise of FinTech is deeply rooted in the financial crisis. Since the financial crisis of 2008, FinTech has greatly increased and developed. The FinTech industry includes P2P(peer-to-peer) lending, a digital-only bank, big data, payments, personal finance, retail investment, remittance, equity financing and so on. Furthermore, start-ups have played an important role in the FinTech industry. FinTech start-ups have offered new and fresh services at lower costs through well-designated platforms or mobile apps. Specifically, London becomes a FinTech hub in the world and there are lots of FinTech start-ups in UK.Recently, the Korean government has tried to assist and encourage the FinTech industry through legislation. Many FinTech start-ups have already operated in Korea. For example, P2P lending platforms like 8percent and Moneyaution have operated, but legislation for P2P lending business has been unclear and insufficient. In addition, internet-only banks like Kakao-bank and K-Bank have started, but complicated legal arguments have still continued under the Banking Act.In this connection, this paper explores regulation of the FinTech industry in UK. First, the FinTech industry in UK is examined specifically in respect of P2P lending and a digital-only bank. Second, regulation of P2P lending and a digital-only bank is deeply analyzed in UK."
Bayesian case influence analysis for GARCH models based on Kullback–Leibler divergence,2016,"['Bayesian case influence', 'GARCH models', 'Kullback–Leibler divergence']",,"Influence analysis has become an important tool for statistical analysis. This paper is concerned with Bayesian case influence analysis for generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model. Case influence analysis is developed for both the joint and marginal posterior distributions based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence (K–L divergence).A simplified expression is presented for computing the K–L divergence between the full data posterior distribution and the case-deleted posterior distributions. The related computations can be done numerically by Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples from posterior distribution with full data. Some simulation studies are carried out to examine the performance of the proposed methods and show the relations between case-deletion model (CDM) and mean-shift outlier model (MSOM) for the GARCH models. Meanwhile, the methods are also illustrated by a real data."

During four months, the author observed and interviewed to students working as a supplementary teacher at the K middle school and found three unique collective mentalities as a result. The first thing was named as ‘master mentality’ which implied that it was man who master the playground at the school.Constructing based on meritocracy, this mentality was legitimated by the collective consensus which was about persons who have capabilities on physical activity should occupy the place. The second thing was ‘norm mentality’ which was about there are somethings made persons suitable for the playground. For male students, these characteristics were listed as ability to play the soccer and to sweat much without any consideration about next class. In contrast, for female students these norms are mostly characterized with some avoidance from competition, sunshine, and others’ evaluative gaze. Last thing was drawn as ‘tolerance mentality’ which means that male students as a master of the playground had to have tolerant mindset to let the girls play on the ground. This mentality also connoted that it is definitely a man who is able to give a permission to girls to use the playground, because the man is a master of the playground."

Second, after conducting K-means cluster analysis based on the three perceived value factor scores, three groups were categorized as “monetary and convenience advantages seeker,” “availability of products/services seeker,” and “personal security seeker.” Lastly, the results of the decision tree analysis indicated that there were statistically significant differences among the three groups in terms of both socio-demographic and travel-related profiles. The results of this study have significant implications for the management of meditels."
비만에 이환된 아동청소년에서 보이는 정신건강문제,2016,"['Obesity', 'Child and Adolescents', 'Mental Health Problem', '비만', '소아청소년', '정신건강문제']",,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate mental health problems in obese child and adolescent patients. We assess the frequency of mental health problems and their differences according to sex, school grade and severity of obesity.  Methods: The sample consisted of 106 children and adolescents aged 8-16 years (61 boys with mean age 10.98±2.26, 45 girls with mean age 9.74±1.96, p=.004) who were diagnosed with obesity and recruited at the Department of Pediatrics of Jeju National University Hospital.

Various technologies have been developed. Generally, image retrieval is widely preceded by comparing colors and shapes among images. In some cases, images with similar color, shape and even meaning are hard to retrieve. In this article, in order to retrieve the object in an image, technical value of middle level is converted into meaning value of middle level. Furthermore, to enhance accuracy of segmentation, K-means algorithm is engaged to compute k values for various images.

"Comparison of the Surface Chemical Properties of Plastic Film House, Upland, and Orchard Soils in Gyeongbuk Province",2016,"['Soil chemicals', 'Plastic film house', 'Upland', 'Orchard']",,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the soil fertility about plastic film house, upland, and orchard in Gyeongbuk Province, Korea. The surface chemical properties of soil samples were investigated every 4 year from 2000 year at upland, 2001 year at orchard, and 2002 year at plastic film house. During 12 year’s monitoring, mean soil pH was increased by 0.7 and 0.8 pH unit from pH 5.7 in upland and orchard, respectively, 0.5 pH unit from pH 6.5 in plastic film house. About 50% of all the field samples occupied within the recommended pH range (pH 6-7). Although soil organic matter (SOM) was gradually increased by about 10 g ㎏<SUP>-1</SUP> for 12 years, 40% of orchard, 49% of plastic film house, and 77% of upland soil samples were still below the 3% SOM. The mean concentration of available phosphate for 12 years in upland, orchard, and plastic film house were 530, 600, and 760 mg ㎏<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. The relative frequencies exceeding the recommended available phosphate range (300-550 ㎎ ㎏<SUP>-1</SUP>) were 43%, 53%, and 66% at upland, orchard, and plastic film house soils, respectively. NH₄OAc exchangeable K⁺ of upland, orchard, and plastic film house in the last soil test were 0.8, 0.9, and 1.6 cmolc ㎏<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. The relative frequencies above the recommended K level were 56% and 70% of orchard and plastic film house soil samples, respectively. The levels of crop nutrients except exchangeable Ca and Mg in upland soil were tended to increase gradually in the three fields. Exchangeable Mg, EC, available phosphate, organic matter and soil pH could be used as principle components to differentiate the chemical properties of three land fields. This analysis revealed that the soil fertility was affected by cropping method and field management, although additional research is needed to assess the importance of management on soil chemical properties and many fields indicate an opportunity for improvement in fertilizer management."

In MS, Asaṅga simply quotes the cittamātra passage and does not offer any explanation. On the contrary, In Viṃś, Vasubandhu the kośakāra adds a short but exquisite commentary.After Viṃś, the cittamātra passage with Vasubandhu’s commentary is quoted until the time of Ratnākaraśānti. It is quoted as a typical āgama to prove the theory of ‘Mind-only’.In Viṃś, Vasubandhu the kośakāra considers “citta” and “vijñapti” as synonyms and interprets the meaning of “mātra” as a negation of external objects. Therefore, he interprets “cittamātra” as “vijñaptimātra”.On the other hand, Mādhyamikas, such as Bhāviveka, criticizes Yogācāras for misunderstanding the cittamātra passage. Mādhyamikas interprets the passage as not a negation of external objects but as a negation of kārtṛ and bhoktṛ viz. the ātman.Yogācāras, however, does not acknowledge their criticism. Not only Dharmapāla and Sthiramati, who would have known of Bhāviveka’s criticism, but also Asvabhāva and Vinītadeva, who commented on the cittamātra passage in the MS and Viṃś respectively, just paraphrased Vasubandhu’s explanation and didn’t respond to Bhāviveka’s criticism.The same is true of Ratnātnākaraśānti.Lastly, I examined the original meaning of the cittamātra passage in the DśBh and Vasubandhu’s commentary on it (十地經論), and it is confirmed that the original meaning of the cittamātra passage is a negation of kārtṛ and the bhoktṛ viz. the ātman. Vasubandhu’s commentary on the DśBh, though unobvious, seems to interpret the cittamātra passage as a negation of ātman. Therefore, it is certain that the Yogācāras’ interpretation of cittamātra passage is different from its original meaning.This could allude that the author of the commentary of DśBh (十地經論) and the author of Viṃś might be different."

Subjects were 20 ADHD boys and girls of 4th and 5th grade, and the same number of general children. Intelligence was measured by K-WISC-Ⅲ, and each of three components of working memory(central executive, phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad) was measured by two subtests. The data were analysed with t-test, ANCOVA, and Pearson correlation coefficients. The results showed the difference between the two groups only in the central executive of working memory, not in the phonological loop or visuospatial sketchpad. This implies that the impairments of ADHD children are not in the perception of information but in the storage, regulation, and processing of information. The difference in the capacity of central executive between the two groups disappeared when the effects of intelligence was mediated statistically in the ANCOVA analysis. It means that the intelligence and working memory may share some common cognitive processes. The analysis of correlation coefficients revealed that the central executive and the memory of static matrices had high correlations with intelligence both in the ADHD and the whole group. This made it possible to presume that the ADHD children may rely heavily on the visual information in their cognitive processes in spite of their inefficiency of visual information processing."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Korean version of the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (K-CAINS).Inpatients (n = 49) and outpatients (n = 70) with schizophrenia were recruited from three institutions. The confirmative factor analysis, test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity were assessed. The study group consisted of 71 males (59.7%) and 48 females (40.3%). Their mean age was 42.15 years (SD = 12.2).The K-CAINS was confirmed to be divided into two subscales of 9 items related to “motivation/pleasure” and 4 items related to “expression” in concordance with the original version of the CAINS. The results showed that the K-CAINS had a good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.84-0.94), test-retest reliability (r = 0.90, P < 0.001). Convergent validity was proven by demonstrating a significant correlation with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative subscale, and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Discriminant validity was proven by the lack of a significant correlation with the PANSS positive subscale, the Korean version of the Beck depression inventory (BDI), the Korean version of the Calgary depression scale for schizophrenia (K-CDSS), and the Modified Simpson Angus scale (MSAS). The K-CAINS could be a reliable and valid tool to assess the negative symptoms of Korean schizophrenia patients."

Type 2 Diabetes Induces Prolonged P-wave Duration without Left Atrial Enlargement,2016,"['Diabetes Mellitus', 'Type 2', 'P-wave Duration', 'Sodium Current', 'Connexin-40', 'Connexin-43']",,"Prolonged P-wave duration has been observed in diabetes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the possible mechanisms. A rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was used. P-wave durations were obtained using surface electrocardiography and sizes of the left atrium were determined using echocardiography. Cardiac inward rectifier K+ currents (Ik1), Na+ currents (INa), and action potentials were recorded from isolated left atrial myocytes using patch clamp techniques. Left atrial tissue specimens were analyzed for total connexin-40 (Cx40) and connexin-43 (Cx43) expression levels on western-blots. Specimens were also analyzed for Cx40 and Cx43 distribution and interstitial fibrosis by immunofluorescent and Masson trichrome staining, respectively. The mean P-wave duration was longer in T2DM rats than in controls; however, the mean left atrial sizes of each group of rats were similar. The densities of Ik1 and INa were unchanged in T2DM rats compared to controls. The action potential duration was longer in T2DM rats, but there was no significant difference in resting membrane potential or action potential amplitude compared to controls. The expression level of Cx40 protein was significantly lower, but Cx43 was unaltered in T2DM rats. However, immunofluorescent labeling of Cx43 showed a significantly enhanced lateralization. Staining showed interstitial fibrosis was greater in T2DM atrial tissue.Prolonged P-wave duration is not dependent on the left atrial size in rats with T2DM.Dysregulation of Cx40 and Cx43 protein expression, as well as fibrosis, might partly account for the prolongation of P-wave duration in T2DM."

Theprevalence was 56.2% for anxiety and 63.1% for depression, and 20.0% for CRCI. There were significant correlations among the variables,objective cognitive function and self-reported cognitive decline, psychological distress, and quality of life. Psychological distresswas directly affected by CRCI. (R2=29%). QOL was directly affected by CRCI. Psychological distress and CRCI effected QOL (R2=43%).Psychological distress had a partial mediating effect (β= -.56, p <.001) in the relationship between self-reported cognitive decline andquality of life (Sobel test: Z= -5.08, p <.001). Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, nursing intervention programs focusing onmanaging cognitive decline, and decreasing psychological distress are highly recommended to improve quality of life in cancer patients."

The main results of this study are like below. First, the sense of beauty is the statistical rate showing that Chinese women start having it later than Korean women, which means that China is still influenced by Korea. Second, regarding the perception of herbal cosmetics, Korean women focus on the differentiation of ingredients while Chinese women focus on the safety for skin. Third, Chinese women show greater favorable feelings toward herbal cosmetics than Korean women while they are also willing to invest more money in the consumption of herbal cosmetics. Due to the influence of the recent K-wave, there have been active researches on herbal cosmetics using herbal ingredients as raw materials. However, there are not many comparative researches on differences in the concrete perception of herbal cosmetics, targeting Korean and Chinese women. Thus, this study is expected to contribute to active research activities in the future, and also to provide basic data such as education related to herbal cosmetics and marketing strategies in case when Korean herbal cosmetics enter the Chinese market."

Influence of Ti Doping on the Critical Behavior and Magnetocaloric Effect in Disordered Ferromagnets La0.7Ba0.3Mn1−x Ti x O3,2016,,,"<P>The Ti-substitution influence on the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of La0.7Ba0.3Mn1-x Ti (x) O-3 (x = 0.05 and 0.1) was investigated. Based on Banerjee's criteria and Franco's universal curves, we proved the existence of a second-order magnetic phase transition in the samples. Using the modified Arrott plot method, we determined the critical parameters T (C) a parts per thousand 245 K, beta = 0.374 +/- A 0.013, gamma = 1.228 +/- A 0.045, and delta = 4.26 +/- A 0.03 for x = 0.05, and T (C) a parts per thousand 169 K, beta = 0.339 +/- A 0.001, gamma = 1.307 +/- A 0.003, and delta = 4.78 +/- A 0.02 for x = 0.1. With these critical values, the predictable scaling behavior of the M(H) data above and below T (C) proves that the calculated exponents are unambiguous and intrinsic. The values beta = 0.374 for x = 0.05 and beta = 0.339 for x = 0.1 suggest that the magnetic phase transition of the samples falls into the three-dimensional (3D) Heisenberg and 3D Ising universality classes, respectively, corresponding to short-range ferromagnetic (FM) order due to FM clusters in a wide temperature range even above T (C), as confirmed by electron spin resonance studies. In reference to the magnetocaloric effect around T (C), the magnetic entropy change reaches maximum values (|Delta S-max|) of about 4 and 3 J kg(-1) K-1 for x = 0.05 and 0.1, respectively, for a magnetic field change 50 kOe. Magnetic field dependencies of |Delta S-max| obey a power function |Delta S-max(H)| ae H (n) , where exponent values n = 0.59 and 0.61 for x = 0.05 and 0.1, respectively, were determined from the relation n = 1 + (beta-1)/(beta + gamma). The difference between the experimental n values and the theoretical value n = 2/3 of the mean field model is due to the presence of short-range FM order in the samples.</P>"

Popper)의 기준에 따르면 현상학, 해석학, 비판이론, 포스트모더니즘을 아우른다. 이 두 흐름의 현재 상태를 행정학의 대표 저널에 실린 논문들의 주제어 검색과 선행연구를 통해 살펴보았는데, 현 상황은 인문학주의가 상당히 부족하다. 이는 응용과학의 속성인 대응성에 치중하다 보니 나타난 현상으로 보인다. 그러나 이제는 사회과학의 선두에 선 학문으로, 다른 학문에 연구의 성과를 수출하여야 할 입장에 있는 행정학은 대응성과 아울러 정합성을 요구함을 지적하였다. 그렇지만 과학주의는 인문학적 요소를 받아들여 왔고, 인문학주의는 과학의 발달과 그 영향을 수용해 왔다. 쿤 (T.

Here scientism insists that social sciences should follow the methodology of natural science in the context that the subjects to be discussed are objective. Scientism in Public Administration covers Logical Positivism, Post-positivism and Behaviorism, which have influenced Public Administration. Human studies in Public Administration insist that social sciences have some aspects which can never be reduced to natural sciences, which means that social sciences have inherent elements distinguishablefrom natural sciences. They covers Phenomenology, Hermeneutics, Critical Theory. This paper analyzes the two above-mentioned streams through keyword review in the representative journals on Public Administration. The result shows us that human studies’ voices in Public Administration have been weak in comparison with the scientism.But nowadays scientism needs human studies and the latter needs the former as well. This paper accepts this trend and makes an effort for the harmony the two camps that have shown the antagonistic attitudes in Public Administration. For example, Thomas Kuhn’s paradigm theory has been identified as the effort to human studies from scientism, while T-G Model is recognizable to scientism from human studies. This is the best way to theory-building in PublicAdministration."

Subsequently, we have assumed a decreasing price curve from increasing distance from a nearby subway station, estimated a price curve and evaluated whether the area of influence actually exists using regression analysis of each cluster. The 10 area of influence clusters were largely divided into strong, weak, and no area of influence of subway station. The stations where the strong areas of influence are formed are mainly located in center, sub-centers, and local centers; stations where weak and no areas of influence are formed are mostly located in the adjacent areas of center or sub-centers or suburbs."

Measurements were carried out during the daytime in autumn, a transient season that exhibits human thermal environments ranging from neutral to very hot. The mean air temperature and absolute humidity of the houses were 14.6-16.8℃ (max. 22. 3℃) and 7.0-12.0 g·m<sup>-3</sup> higher than those of the outdoor area, respectively. Solar (K) and terrestrial (L) radiation were compared directionally from the sky hemisphere (↓) and the ground hemisphere (↑). The mean K↓ and K↑ values for the houses were respectively 232.5-367.8 W·m<sup>-2</sup> and 44.9-55.7 W·m<sup>-2</sup> lower than those in the outdoor area; the mean L↓ and L↑ values were respectively 150.4-182.3 W·m<sup>-2</sup> and 30.5-33.9 W·m<sup>-2</sup> higher than those in the outdoor area. Thus, L was revealed to be more influential on the greenhouse effect in the houses than K. Consequently, mean radiant temperature in the houses was higher than the outdoor area during the daytime from 10:45 to 14:15. As a result, mean human thermal sensation values in the PMV, PET, and UTCI of the houses were respectively 3.2-3.4℃ (max. 4.7℃), 15.2-16.4℃ (max. 23.7℃) and 13.6-15.4℃ (max. 22.3℃) higher than those in the outdoor area. The heat stress levels that were influenced by human thermal sensation were much higher in the houses (between hot and very hot) than in the outdoor (between neutral and warm). Further, the microclimatic component that most affected the human thermal sensation in the houses was air temperature that was primarily influenced by L↓. Therefore, workers in the plastic houses could experience strong heat stresses, equal to hot or higher, when air temperature rose over 22℃ on clear autumn days."

A Corpus-Based Analysis of Kasum ‘Chest/Breast’ in Korean,2016,,,"In recent years, much research has been carried out on body-part terms in expressing metonymic and metaphorical notions in terms of embodiment in cognitive linguistics. Among the terms, heart-centered expressions have been widely explored in English and other languages to show the significance of our bodily experiences in expressing our emotions as well as interpersonal or social relationships. However, little research has been carried out on the metaphoric expressions of chest or breast (cf. Kövecses 2002, Lakoff & Johnson 1980). The purpose of this research is to explore literal and metaphoric meanings of kasum ‘chest/ breast’ in a Korean written corpus in terms of corpus linguistics and conceptual metaphor (Perez 2008, Berendt, et al. n.d.). This research analyzes 2,373 tokens of kasum, 114 ces-kasum ‘milk-breast’ and 355 simcang ‘heart’ from the Sejong Project Corpus. Cognitive linguistic research has shown that the head is usually related to mind/reason but the heart to emotion/feelings in many languages. However, examination of the Korean data shows that simcang is used literally in most cases as a technical term in medical contexts, and that ces-kasum is used literally in most cases to refer to a woman’s breast. Unlike these two body-part terms, kasum is used as a cover term to express not only the upper body part literally but also an entity as a locus and perceiver of emotion/ feelings metaphorically. Examination of the corpus data shows the following major findings: (i) 819 tokens (34.5%) are used to refer to the body part chest literally, 1,512 tokens (63.7%) metaphorically (Deignan 2005), (ii) 921 tokens (38.8%) are used to show physiological responses in expressing emotion/feelings, using such terms as “the chest is aching, pounding, choking/being blocked, trembling, sinking, etc.”, (iii) 412 tokens (17.4%) are used to show kasum is a locus for emotion. As these findings show, in Korean, as folk knowledge contrary to the scientific knowledge about the roles of the brain, kasum is viewed as a locus or perceiver for emotional feelings in response to physical/ physiological stimuli. The findings show that the folk knowledge forms the basis for conceptual metaphor for kasum: (i) a locus for feelings, (ii) a container of emotions, (iii) an entity/a material, (iv) a storage/hiding place, etc. Finally, this research shows that in Korean, unlike in English and some other languages, kasum plays an important role in expressing emotional feelings, displaying conceptual metaphorical meanings derived from folk knowledge."

Although there are many prior studies examining the effects of the IFRS, the results are not consistent. The reason is because most prior studies focuses on short pre-adoption period(2009 and/or 2010 year). Because there are many different characteristics in IFRS compared to K-GAAP, it necessarily takes time for the stakeholders to understand and apply IFRS. Therefore, this study focus on the long period to examine the effect of IFRS adoption on value-relevance of accounting number. To do this, my research period is from 2000 to 2015.The empirical results are as follows. First, the combined(income and equity) value-relevance of post-adoption period is higher than that of pre-adoption period when the pre-adoption period is set long(from 2000 to 2010). However, the opposite result is found when the pre-adoption period is set short(from 2006 to 2010). These findings mean that the adoption of IFRS does not guarantee unconditional increase of value-relevance of accounting information. Second, the result shows that the incremental value-relevance of equity is significantly improved after IFRS adoption except for the firms with intensive intangible assets. Third, I find that the incremental value-relevance of income significantly decreases after IFRS　adoption except for loss firms. This paper analyzes the value-relevance effect of IFRS by comparing post-adoption period and two pre-adoption period(long and short) and implies the possible reason why prior literature finds mixed results about IFRS effects. In addition, this study has additional contribution to the IFRS literature by controlling the factors such as intangible-intensity, loss, Big 4 auditors, and difference in listing market(KOSPI vs KOSDAQ) that could have impact on the value-relevance of accounting information. Therefore, the findings of this study are expected to have implication to accounting standards setter and users of accounting information."

However, the quality of the IR image is often degraded by low resolution and noise corruption. This paper addresses target segmentation with the IR image. Multiple regions of interest (ROI) are extracted by the multi-level segmentation and targets are segmented from the individual ROI. Each level of the multi-level segmentation is composed of a k-means clustering algorithm an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and a decision process. The k-means clustering algorithm initializes the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the EM algorithm iteratively estimates those parameters. Each pixel is assigned to one of clusters during the decision. This paper proposes the selection and the merging of the extracted ROIs. ROI regions are selectively merged in order to include the overlapped ROI windows. In the experiments, the proposed method is tested on an IR image capturing two pedestrians at night. The performance is compared with conventional methods showing that the proposed method outperforms others."

Methods: To do this, we first applied five types of semi-automatic segmentation methods (i.e., level-set-based active contour model, localized region-based active contour model, seeded region growing, K-means clustering, and fuzzy C-means clustering) to preprocessed GGN images, respectively. Then, to measure the similarities, we calculated the Dice coefficient of the segmented area using each semiautomatic method with the result of the manually segmented area by two radiologists. Results: Comparison experiments were performed using 40 persistent GGNs. In our experiment, the mean Dice coefficient for each semiautomatic segmentation tool with manually segmented area was 0.808 for the level-set-based active contour model, 0.8001 for the localized region-based active contour model, 0.629 for seeded region growing, 0.7953 for K-means clustering, and 0.7999 for fuzzy C-means clustering, respectively. Conclusions: The level-set-based active contour model algorithm showed the best performance, which was most similar to the result of manual segmentation by two radiologists. From the differentiation between the normal parenchyma and the nodule, it was also the most efficient. Effective segmentation methods will be essential for the development of computer-aided diagnosis systems for more accurate early diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer in thin-section CT images."

Charge transport and thermoelectric properties of double-filled Nd1-z Yb z Fe4-x Co x Sb12 skutterudites,2016,,,"<P>p-Type Nd1-z Yb (z) Fe4-x Co (x) Sb-12 (z = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and x = 0, 0.5, 1.0) skutterudites were synthesized by using encapsulated melting and hot pressing. The effects of Nd/Yb double filling and Co substitution for Fe (charge compensation) on the microstructure, the charge transport, and the thermoelectric properties of the skutterudite specimens were investigated. All specimens were transformed to the skutterudite phase by the annealing process, and a few secondary phases such as marcasite FeSb2 were formed together with the skutterudite phase, although their formation was suppressed with increasing Co content. The lattice constant changed with the filling ratio of Nd/Yb and Fe/Co substitution, which meant that the double filling of Nd/Yb and the substitution of Co for Fe were successfully performed. All specimens showed p-type conduction at temperatures ranging from 323 K to 823 K and exhibited degenerate semiconductor characteristics, in which the electrical conductivity decreased and the Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing temperature. The Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing Nd and Co contents due to the decreased carrier concentration while the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity decreased. The maximum Seebeck coefficient was obtained at temperatures in the range from 723 K to 823 K, and the thermal conductivity significantly increased at temperatures above 623 K due to bipolar conduction. The dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, showed maximum values at temperatures ranging from 723 K to 823 K due to the decrease in the Seebeck coefficient (or the decrease in the power factor) and the increase in the thermal conductivity at high temperatures. The maximum ZT = 0.81 was obtained for Nd0.75Yb0.25Fe4Sb12 at 823 K and for Nd0.75Yb0.25Fe3CoSb12 at 723 K.</P>"

Subjects were carried out total 6 simulated, but followed same conditions and rules of actual competition, with providing similar inter-game break time. Eight well trained male competitors, who had awarded from national wide competitions, voluntarily participated in this study and revealed 51.5(±8.8) mL·kg<sup>-1</sup>min<sup>-1</sup>of maximal oxygen consumption and 12.4(±5.1) % body fat. TWOWAY ANOVA (tournament round vs. pre & post each game) was adopted to test whether the mean differences were existed, and the interaction between individual factors and main effect within each factors were analyzed. Statistical significance was set at Alpha (α) = .05. While there were no significant changes in blood hydrogen ion concentration (i.e., pH) and partial pressure of oxygen (PO<sub>2</sub>), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO<sub>2</sub>) significantly decreased as the tournament games were repeated. The level of hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly elevated only during the 1<sup>st</sup> round of tournament. Na<sup>+</sup> was significantly increased but K<sup>+</sup> was decreased. Ca<sup>2</sup>+ concentration however, was not significantly altered. Although the changes of blood glucose level did not show any consistent patterns, free fatty acid (FFA) concentration was increased after completed each game compared to prior to initiate the each game. Blood NH<sub>3</sub>, lactic acid, and uric acid concentration increased at immediately after each game, and the pattern was maintained throughout the tournament round continued. These results reflected that the repeated participation of the tournament may cause the accumulation of the by-products of fatigue substances in blood and alteration of various ion components and energy substrates. Accordingly, the ways of reducing the physical fatigue and providing adequate energy source inter-tournament games needs to be necessarily considered for successful Kumdo competition. Data obtained from this study could valuable for searching the effective training and management methods to improve the performance and reduce the fatigue of the professional elite Kumdo competitors."

Prevalence of Frailty and Aging-Related Health Conditions in Older Koreans in Rural Communities: a Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Aging Study of Pyeongchang Rural Area,2016,"['Frailty', 'Sarcopenia', 'Disability', 'Geriatrics', 'Population Health', 'Aged']",,"<P>Frailty has been previously studied in Western countries and the urban Korean population; however, the burden of frailty and geriatric conditions in the aging populations of rural Korean communities had not yet been determined. Thus, we established a population-based prospective study of adults aged ≥ 65 years residing in rural communities of Korea between October 2014 and December 2014. All participants underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment that encompassed the assessment of cognitive and physical function, depression, nutrition, and body composition using bioimpedance analysis. We determined the prevalence of frailty based on the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Korean version of FRAIL (K-FRAIL) criteria, as well as geriatric conditions. We recruited 382 adults (98% of eligible adults; mean age: 74 years; 56% women). Generally, sociodemographic characteristics were similar to those of the general rural Korean population. Common geriatric conditions included instrumental activity of daily living disability (39%), malnutrition risk (38%), cognitive dysfunction (33%), multimorbidity (32%), and sarcopenia (28%), while dismobility (8%), incontinence (8%), and polypharmacy (3%) were less common conditions. While more individuals were classified as frail according to the K-FRAIL criteria (27%) than the CHS criteria (17%), the CHS criteria were more strongly associated with prevalent geriatric conditions. Older Koreans living in rural communities have a significant burden of frailty and geriatric conditions that increase the risk of functional decline, poor quality of life, and mortality. The current study provides a basis to guide public health professionals and policy-makers in prioritizing certain areas of care and designing effective public health interventions to promote healthy aging of this vulnerable population.</P>"
프로젝트 파이낸스 사업의 투자타당성 분석기법 재검토 -유한한 사업수명과 시간가변적 자본비용을 반영하는 사례연구-,2016,"['프로젝트 파이낸스', '유한한 사업수명의 투자안', '투자타당성 분석', 'Project Finance', 'Finite Project Life', 'Capital Budgeting', 'NPV', 'IRR']","유한한 사업수명을 가진 투자안에 대한 투자타당성 분석기법으로서 순현가법(NPV) 및 내부수익율법(IRR)이 전통적인 기법으로서 널리 인정받고 있다. 전통적인 투자타당성 분석기법을 재검토하게 된 배경은 프로젝트 파이낸스(이하 “PF”) 사업의 특징은 사업수명이 유한할뿐만 아니라 사업주체인 특수목적회사(이하 “SPC”)의 부채조달액에 대한 상환소구권이 제한되는 사업특성이 투자타당성 과정에 반영되어야하기 때문이다. 사업수명이 유한하면 PF가 향유하는 절세액의 지속기간도 유한하고, 자금조달도 SPC의 현금흐름을 거의 유일한 담보로 이루어지기 때문에 자본비용이 상대적으로 더 높을 것으로 예상되기 때문이다. PF 투자안의 평가에 있어 유한한 사업수명과 절세효과, 시간가변적 자본구조와 자본비용등 PF의 특성을 적절하게 반영하여 NPV 및 IRR기법을 적용하는 투자타당성 분석사례를 제시하고자 한다. 본 사례연구에 적용하는 시간가변적 자본비용으로서 투자안의 세후 가중평균자본비용(Ko), 세전 가중평균자본비용(K<sub>BT</sub>) 및 자기자본비용(Ke) 모형은 Campani(2015), 이원흠(2015)을 응용하여 도출한다. 또한 동일한 투자타당성 분석결과를 보이는 PF 투자안의 가치평가 모형으로서 APV(Ku)모형, FCF(Ko)모형, CCF(K<sub>BT</sub>)모형 및 CFE(Ke)모형을 도출하고 사례연구에 적용한다. 본 연구의 사례분석 결과를 통해 살펴보면 PF 투자안의 사업수명이 유한하면 투자안의 자본비용은 유한한 절세효과의 지속기간 차이 때문에 계속기업에 비해 자본비용이 크게 추정된다. 자본구조가 사업기간 중 변화하므로 투자안의 자본비용도 매기 변하게 된다. 따라서 시간가변적 자본비용을 적용해 NPV기법을 적용하는데 문제가 없으나, IRR기법을 적용하는데에는 문제가 야기된다, 본 연구에서는 시간불변적인 무부채조달 사업의 자본비용 Ku를 투자거부율로 활용하면 PF 투자안에 대한 분석기법으로서 IRR기법을 올바로 적용할 수 있다는 것도 보였다.","It is considered to be the proper techniques for evaluating investment projects, which apply both the NPV and IRR rules. These traditional capital budgeting methods are established ingeneral for the infinite-life project, which is usually assumed to have a constant leverage ratio and then a constant cost of capital. This is the reason why for capital budgeting of the finite time-horizon project finance(hereafter PF) we have to take into considerations the proper adjustments in the traditional techniques. In this study I develop time-varying valuation models such as APV(K<sub>U</sub>), FCF(K<sub>O</sub>, and CCF(K<sub>BT</sub> for capital budgeting of the finite-life PF projects, taking into account both the finite tax benefits during the project life and also time-varying aspects in the cost of capital. And I can show all the PF valuation models to have the same project values for capital budgeting purpose. It means that the proposed valuation models taking into account the time-varying cost of capital can conclude that the newly proposed NPV rule can be applied consistently for the finite life PF projects. Based on the case study addressing the newly proposed valuation models to adjust the time-varying cost of capital, I can conclude that the traditional evaluation techniques for the infinite-life project have to be revised in case of evaluating the finite-life PF projects."
Stabilization of metastable ɛ-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin films using a GaFeO<sub>3</sub> buffer,2016,,,"<P>This paper reports a simple and robust route to stabilize metastable epsilon-Fe2O3 as an epitaxial thin film using a GaFeO3 (GFO) buffer in pulsed laser deposition. The use of an isostructural GFO buffer widens the range of film growth, allowing for stabilization on a range of substrates even with different surface symmetries, such as Al2O3 (0001), SrTiO3 (111), and Y:ZrO2 (100). All films grown on these substrates were c-axis oriented with the characteristic in-plane domain structures. Magnetization of these buffered thin films showed considerable magnetic anisotropy at 350 K. In particular, in-plane magnetization was found to be relatively larger in the films grown on the Y: ZrO2 (100) compared to the other cases. Heterostructuring epsilon-Fe2O3 on GFO is promising in the applications of epsilon-Fe2O3 for magnetic and multiferroic devices in that it provides a larger growth window and an effective means to optimize the film properties beyond the simple substitution of Fe with Ga.

Multi-Level Segmentation of Infrared Images with Region of Interest Extraction,2016,"['Infrared image segmentation', 'Region of interest extraction', 'Multilevel segmentation', 'Gaussian mixture modeling', 'Statistical image processing']",,"Infrared (IR) imaging has been researched for various applications such as surveillance.IR radiation has the capability to detect thermal characteristics of objects under low-light conditions. However, automatic segmentation for finding the object of interest would be challenging since the IR detector often provides the low spatial and contrast resolution image without color and texture information. Another hindrance is that the image can be degraded by noise and clutters. This paper proposes multi-level segmentation for extracting regions of interest (ROIs) and objects of interest (OOIs) in the IR scene. Each level of the multi-level segmentation is composed of a k-means clustering algorithm, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and a decision process. The k-means clustering initializes the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and the EM algorithm estimates those parameters iteratively. During the multi-level segmentation, the area extracted at one level becomes the input to the next level segmentation. Thus, the segmentation is consecutively performed narrowing the area to be processed. The foreground objects are individually extracted from the final ROI windows. In the experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using several IR images, in which human subjects are captured at a long distance.The average probability of error is shown to be lower than that obtained from other conventional methods such as Gonzalez, Otsu, k-means, and EM methods"

Analysis of Molecular Variance and Population Structure in Southern Indian Finger Millet Genotypes Using Three Different Molecular Markers,2016,"['AMOVA', 'population structure', 'finger millet', 'molecular marker']",,"The genetic relationship among 42 genotypes of finger millet collected from different geographical regions of southern India was investigated using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR), and simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. Ten RAPD primers produced 111 polymorphic bands. Five ISSR primers produced a total of 61 bands. Of these, 23 bands were polymorphic. The RAPD and ISSR fingerprints revealed 71.3 and 37.4% polymorphic banding patterns, respectively. Thirty-six SSR primers yielded 83 scorable alleles in which 62 were found to be polymorphic.Out of 36 SSR primers used, 14 primers (46.6%) produced polymorphic bands. The SSR primer UGEP7 produced a maximum number of six alleles. Mean polymorphic information content (PIC) of RAPD, ISSR and SSR were 0.44, 0.28, and 0.14, respectively. Molecular variances among the population were 2, 11, and 1% for RAPD, ISSR, and SSR markers, respectively. SSR produced 99% molecular variance within individuals. RAPD and ISSR markers produced a low level of molecular variance within individuals. The STRUCTURE (model-based program) analysis revealed that the 42 finger millet genotypes could be divided into a maximum of four subpopulations. Based on the Bayesian statistics, each RAPD and SSR marker produced three subpopulations (K=3), while ISSR marker showed four subpopulations (K=4). This study revealed that RAPD and SSR markers could narrow down the analysis of population structure and it may form the basis for finger millet breeding and improvement programs in the future."

In general, long-term forecasting of power demand has been studied from both the consumer’s perspective and an econometrics model in the form of a generalized linear model with predictors. Time series techniques are used for short-term forecasting with no predictors as predictors must be predicted prior to forecasting response variables and containing estimation errors during this process is inevitable. In previous researches, seasonal exponential smoothing method, SARMA (Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average) with consideration to weekly pattern Neuron-Fuzzy model, SVR (Support Vector Regression) model with predictors explored through machine learning, and K-means clustering technique in the various approaches have been applied to short-term power supply forecasting. In this paper, SARMA and intervention model are fitted to forecast the maximum power load daily, weekly, and monthly by using the empirical data from 2011 through 2013. ARMA(2, 1, 2)(1, 1, 1)₇ and ARMA(0, 1, 1)(1, 1, 0)₁₂ are fitted respectively to the daily and monthly power demand, but the weekly power demand is not fitted by AREA because of unit root series. In our fitted intervention model, the factors of long holidays, summer and winter are significant in the form of indicator function. The SARMA with MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of 2.45% and intervention model with MAPE of 2.44% are more efficient than the present seasonal exponential smoothing with MAPE of about 4%. Although the dynamic repression model with the predictors of humidity, temperature, and seasonal dummies was applied to foretaste the daily power demand, it lead to a high MAPE of 3.5% even though it has estimation error of predictors."
A Relationship between Depression and Wandering in Community-Dwelling Elders with Dementia,2016,"['wandering', 'dementia', 'depression.']",,"Background and PurposeWandering is one of the most common behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and associated with some of the adverse outcomes in dementia, such as getting lost or even death. The etiology of wandering is not yet clearly known. As depression and wandering are both very common among the patients with dementia, this study examined the relationship between the depression and wandering among the community dwelling patients with dementia.MethodsFifty community dwelling patients diagnosed with dementia were included in this study if they had primary family caregiver, older than age 18 in Seoul, South Korea. The Geriatric Depression Scale, Korean Version (GDS-K), Korean Version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) and Korean Version of Revised Algase Wandering Scale-Community Version (K-RAWS-CV) were used to measure the severity of depression, cognitive function and wandering.ResultsThirty percents of the patients showed wandering. Mean score of GDS-K was significantly higher in wanderers than non-wanderers. Severity of depression was significantly correlated with the total score of K-RAWS-CV and subscales of persistent walking, repetitive walking, eloping behavior, and mealtime impulsivity in whole sample. K-MMSE score also was related to wandering behavior. The prevalence odds ratio for wandering in depressed patients compared with undepressed group was 8.386 (95% confidence interval: 1.978–35.561).ConclusionsThis study implicates that not only cognitive impairment but also psychosocial aspects should be considered in wandering patients with dementia and suggests assessing the depression in patients would be helpful in identifying the causes of wandering."

Soil samples were collected from 190 fields and assessed the effects of management practices on soil chemical properties at wild edible plant fields under no-till system. The strong acidic soils of pH 5.4 or less were detected in 45% of the soil samples. The level of soil organic matter was being held at mean 63±28 g kg<SUP>-1</SUP>, 2.7 times higher than upland soils in Korea. Available phosphate and exchangeable potassium showed more than recommended levels of upland crops as 680±489 mg kg<SUP>-1</SUP> and 1.94±1.7 cmolc kg<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. The fields of Solidago and Aster showing strong soil acidity and high level of available phosphate and water soluble NO₃<SUP>-</SUP> were distinguished from other crops in analysis of variance and principal component analysis of soil chemicals. These results suggested that high frequency of acidic soil and high levels of available P₂O5, exchangeable K₂O and water soluble NO₃<SUP>-</SUP> were accompanied with the use of urea and NPK-fertilizer based on nitrogen in the field. However, further research is needed to understand the appropriate management of fertilization and the prevention of soil acidification for wild edible plants."

Methods This study included 75 Haenyeo and 340 non-Haenyeo with depressive disorders recruited from the Dementia Early Detection Program in Jeju island. Structural diagnostic interviews were performed using the Korean version of Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. All patients completed the questionnaires, including the Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire (SMCQ), the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), and the Blessed dementia scale. Depression was evaluated by the Korean version of short form the Geriatric Depression Scale (K-SGDS) and cognition was assessed by the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) assessment packet. Results Although the mean scores of the K-SGDS were similar between Haenyeo and non-Haenyeo depressed groups, the Haenyeo group showed a higher mean score on the PSQ-15 (p < 0.001, ANCOVA adjusting for age, the K-SGDS and education). The Haenyeo group showed poorer performance on the Korean Version of Frontal Assessment Batter (p < 0.001), the Mini-Mental State Examination in the Korean version of the CERAD Assessment Packet (p < 0.018), the word fluency test (p < 0.001), and the word list memory test (p = 0.012) in ANCOVA adjusting for age and education. The mean SMCQ score was higher in the Haenyeo depressed group than in the non-Haenyeo depressed group. Conclusions The Haenyeo depressed group shows cognitive dysfunction, especially frontal lobe dysfunction, compared to the non-Haenyeo depressed group, indicating the Haenyeo depressed group may have more severe frontolimbic dysfunction due to chronic exposure to hypoxia. The Haenyeo depressed group suffers more somatic symptoms than the non-Haenyeo depressed group."

Discrimination of <i>Polygonatum</i> species and identification of novel markers using <sup>1</sup>H NMR‐ and UPLC/Q‐TOF MS‐based metabolite profiling,2016,"['Polygonatum', 'species discrimination', 'herbal medicine', 'metabolite profiling', '1H NMR', 'UPLC/Q&#x2010']",,"<P>BACKGROUNDRhizomes of Polygonatum species are commonly used as herbal supplements in Asia. They have different medicinal effects by species but have been misused and mixed owing to their similar taste and smell. Therefore accurate and reliable analytical methods to discriminate between Polygonatum species are required. RESULTSIn this study, global and targeted metabolite profiling using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) was applied to discriminate between different Polygonatum species. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were used to classify and predict species of Polygonatum. Cross-validation derived from PLS-DA revealed good predictive accuracy. Polygonatum species were classified into unique patterns based on K-means clustering analysis. 4-Hydrobenzoic acid and trigonelline were identified as novel marker compounds and quantified accurately. CONCLUSIONThe results demonstrate that metabolite profiling approaches coupled with chemometric analysis can be used to classify and discriminate between different species of various herbal medicines.

In this study, the representative standardized precipitation index (SPI) is classified by various criteria, and the spatial characteristics and applicability of drought in Jeju Island are evaluated from the results. As the result of calculating SPI of 4 weather stations (SPI 3, 6, 9, 12), SPI 12 was found to be relatively simple compared to SPI 6. Also, it was verified that the fluctuation of SPI was greater fot short-term data, and that long-term data was relatively more useful for judging extreme drought. Cluster analysis was performed using the K-means technique, with two variables extracted as the result of factor analysis, and the clustering was terminated with seven-time repeated calculations, and eventually two clusters were formed."
Charge Transport and Thermoelectric Properties of Double-filled Nd1−zYbzFe4−xCoxSb12 Skutterudites,2016,"['Thermoelectric', 'Skutterudite', 'Double filling', 'Charge compensation']",,"p-Type Nd1−zYbzFe4−xCoxSb12 (z = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and x = 0, 0.5, 1.0) skutterudites were synthesized by using encapsulated melting and hot pressing. The effects of Nd/Yb double filling and Co substitution for Fe (charge compensation) on the microstructure, the charge transport, and the thermoelectric properties of the skutterudite specimens were investigated. All specimens were transformed to the skutterudite phase by the annealing process, and a few secondary phases such as marcasite FeSb2 were formed together with the skutterudite phase, although their formation was suppressed with increasing Co content. The lattice constant changed with the filling ratio of Nd/Yb and Fe/Co substitution, which meant that the double filling of Nd/Yb and the substitution of Co for Fe were successfully performed. All specimens showed p-type conduction at temperatures ranging from 323 K to 823 K and exhibited degenerate semiconductor characteristics, in which the electrical conductivity decreased and the Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing temperature.The Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing Nd and Co contents due to the decreased carrier concentration while the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity decreased. The maximum Seebeck coefficient was obtained at temperatures in the range from 723 K to 823 K, and the thermal conductivity significantly increased at temperatures above 623 K due to bipolar conduction.The dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, showed maximum values at temperatures ranging from 723 K to 823 K due to the decrease in the Seebeck coefficient (or the decrease in the power factor) and the increase in the thermal conductivity at high temperatures. The maximum ZT = 0.81 was obtained for Nd0.75Yb0.25Fe4Sb12 at 823 K and for Nd0.75Yb0.25Fe3CoSb12 at 723 K."

Prevalence of Frailty and Aging-Related Health Conditions in Older Koreans in Rural Communities: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Aging Study of Pyeongchang Rural Area,2016,"['Frailty', 'Sarcopenia', 'Disability', 'Geriatrics', 'Population Health', 'Aged']",,"Frailty has been previously studied in Western countries and the urban Korean population; however, the burden of frailty and geriatric conditions in the aging populations of rural Korean communities had not yet been determined. Thus, we established a populationbased prospective study of adults aged ≥ 65 years residing in rural communities of Korea between October 2014 and December 2014. All participants underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment that encompassed the assessment of cognitive and physical function, depression, nutrition, and body composition using bioimpedance analysis. We determined the prevalence of frailty based on the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Korean version of FRAIL (K-FRAIL) criteria, as well as geriatric conditions. We recruited 382 adults (98% of eligible adults; mean age: 74 years; 56% women). Generally, sociodemographic characteristics were similar to those of the general rural Korean population. Common geriatric conditions included instrumental activity of daily living disability (39%), malnutrition risk (38%), cognitive dysfunction (33%), multimorbidity (32%), and sarcopenia (28%), while dismobility (8%), incontinence (8%), and polypharmacy (3%) were less common conditions. While more individuals were classified as frail according to the K-FRAIL criteria (27%) than the CHS criteria (17%), the CHS criteria were more strongly associated with prevalent geriatric conditions. Older Koreans living in rural communities have a significant burden of frailty and geriatric conditions that increase the risk of functional decline, poor quality of life, and mortality. The current study provides a basis to guide public health professionals and policy-makers in prioritizing certain areas of care and designing effective public health interventions to promote healthy aging of this vulnerable population."
Multi-Level Segmentation of Infrared Images with Region of Interest Extraction,2016,"['Infrared image segmentation', 'Region of interest extraction', 'Multilevel segmentation', 'Gaussian mixture modeling', 'Statistical image processing']",,"Infrared (IR) imaging has been researched for various applications such as surveillance. IR radiation has the capability to detect thermal characteristics of objects under low-light conditions. However, automatic segmentation for finding the object of interest would be challenging since the IR detector often provides the low spatial and contrast resolution image without color and texture information. Another hindrance is that the image can be degraded by noise and clutters. This paper proposes multi-level segmentation for extracting regions of interest (ROIs) and objects of interest (OOIs) in the IR scene. Each level of the multi-level segmentation is composed of a k-means clustering algorithm, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and a decision process. The k-means clustering initializes the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and the EM algorithm estimates those parameters iteratively. During the multi-level segmentation, the area extracted at one level becomes the input to the next level segmentation. Thus, the segmentation is consecutively performed narrowing the area to be processed. The foreground objects are individually extracted from the final ROI windows. In the experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using several IR images, in which human subjects are captured at a long distance. The average probability of error is shown to be lower than that obtained from other conventional methods such as Gonzalez, Otsu, k-means, and EM methods."

Soil samples were collected from 190 fields and assessed the effects of management practices on soil chemical properties at wild edible plant fields under no-till system. The strong acidic soils of pH 5.4 or less were detected in 45% of the soil samples. The level of soil organic matter was being held at mean 63±28 g kg-1, 2.7 times higher than upland soils in Korea. Available phosphate and exchangeable potassium showed more than recommended levels of upland crops as 680±489 mg kg-1 and 1.94±1.7 cmolc kg-1, respectively. The fields of Solidago and Aster showing strong soil acidity and high level of available phosphate and water soluble NO3- were distinguished from other crops in analysis of variance and principal component analysis of soil chemicals. These results suggested that high frequency of acidic soil and high levels of available P2O5, exchangeable K2O and water soluble NO3- were accompanied with the use of urea and NPK-fertilizer based on nitrogen in the field. However, further research is needed to understand the appropriate management of fertilization and the prevention of soil acidification for wild edible plants."

The Buddha images with the right shoulder exposed have two types in expression of their drapery. As this form and iconography of the standing Buddha image has no precedents, it seems to have newly introduced after 7<SUP>th</SUP> century. Since the standing Buddha image wearing the robe with the right shoulder exposed was a rare form to China and the west region outside of China, it could be a new type of Buddha image that came from India-Southeast Asia route. The standing Buddha image with no drapery, which has twisted waist from Suksusa-ji temple site, looks like the style of Buddha image at Ajanta Caves in Western India. It means this type of Buddha image came from western India to Silla via Southeast Asia. The pilgrimage to India of Buddhist monks from Silla through the sea route imply that the standing Buddha image with the right shoulder exposed had been transmitted by maritime route. The Buddha images newly found from Southeast Asia as well as the relationship of Baekche(百濟) with Funan(扶南) and Kunlun(崑崙) in the historic records of Nihonshoki(日本書紀) show that each of two types of the Buddha images with the right shoulder exposed possibly came both from southern India and western India by sea."

In the paper, the developed GPE and PCE with different model structures were compared in terms of a prediction capability under different amount of training data and number of inputs. The aim of the comparative study is to identify the relative prediction abilities and model flexibility of GPE and PCE. It was found that the GPE and PCE produce high performance qualities having fast computation speed compared to the developed basis model if new inputs having identical inputs and probability ranges were used. In terms of two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) hypothesis test, mean values of the minimum p-values of the GPE and PCE were 0.999 and 0.569, respectively, if the number of samplings are over 30 cases. Otherwise, the PCE shows significantly reduced performance quality than the GPE."

A main key of origin is a changing of voiced muddy sounds to aspirated sounds and a changing of nasal to non-nasal stops in Qin sounds of 8th century. Voiced muddy sounds changed voiceless aspirated secondarily-clear sounds and nasal stops clear-muddy sounds changed non-nasal stops in Qin sounds of 8th century. Initial-g changed kh in Qin sounds of 8th century. but only 5 characters of 6.8% reflected kh and 65 characters of 84.9% reflected k. It means that reflects of upto Qieyun sounds of 7th century. Initial-ng changed non-nasal stops in Qin sounds of 8th century. But 47 characters of 74.6% reflected ng. It means that Sino-Vietnamese reflected upto Qieyun sounds of 7th century. And velar in the Sino-Vietnamese contained Qin sounds of 8th century and modern sounds. In conclusion, Sino-Vietnamese originated by late Southern and Northern Dynasties sounds of 5th century and Qieyun sounds of 7th century, and effected Qin sounds of 8th century and modern sounds. From now on, through analysis of another initials, I think that origin of Sino-Vietnamese can be cleared."
Inferring tweet location inference for twitter mining,2016,"['Twitter mining', 'SNS', 'Stream data', 'Location inference', 'City monitoring']",,"A tweet, possessing various facets, is created at the speed of thought, propagated in real time and produces social interchange on an international scale. As a result, users demand the analysis of twitter mining with a map to search for trendy topics or ﬁnd what is being talked about among users. Due to the sparsity of location information, however, there are real difﬁculties in analysis related to position information. To run Twitter mining on all Korean users, this study used ﬁrehose level, which is massive 100 % twitter data, while utilizing a new spatial indicator to overcome the sparsity of location information. Furthermore, the study suggested an algorithm to process ﬁrehose data and solutions to overcome the study’s limit. The conventional method of using spritzer level data and the supervised method resulted in 44 times more positions inferred on a tweet than the method using geotag, whereas the method used in this study saw inferences rise 680 fold. In the case of the clustering algorithm, the method of K-Center Clustering was found to have inferred the most number of user residential locations. The ultimate goal of the study is for the twitter data, including the massive volume of location information inferred and created in real time, to serve as a means of city monitoring by overcoming the study’s limit, which is automated reﬁning of unnecessary words for proﬁle location information and twitter mining."

Participants of the study were the patients with chronic schizophrenia who being diagnosed by DSM-IV, the primary participants were eight patients who had difficulty in self-expression and interpersonal relationships due to lack of interactions while they were residing in a rehabilitation facility after discharging from a mental hospital. The period of the study was June to September of 2013, and the study were conducted with a total of 18 sessions for 60 minutes, and twice a week. The process of the study focused on improvement of self-expression and interactions by helping the patients who had difficulty in personal relationships and psychological problems through the process of the early, middle, late and termination stage. Evaluation method of the study used mixed methods of quantitative research and qualitative research. Self-Directed Assertiveness Scale (SDAS) and Relationship Change Scale (RCS) of examination of the interpersonal change were used for quantitative research by an analysis of before and after sessions. For the study of qualitative analysis, the researcher recoded 200 coding of expressive languages and behaviors through the relationships between group members during the process of the study. Through the process of recording, a research found three themes of ‘self-expression’ such as expression of feelings, expression of opinion, and self-disclosure, ‘interaction’ such as intimacy and confidence, and ‘awareness of reality’ such as awareness of situation and plan. The researcher analyzed an individual's psychological dynamics and changes of interactions with others through pretest and posttest of K-HTP (Kinetic-House, Tree, Person) drawings. The results of this study were as the following. First, according to the results of the differences between pre and posttest of self-expression through expressive group arts psychotherapy, a mean score of the pretest was 2.83 (SD = .83), and the mean score of the posttest was 3.63 (SD = .47). The result statistically showed significant difference (t = -3.97, p < .05). The results suggested that the expressive group arts psychotherapy helped the patients with chronic schizophrenia who have problems with self-expression by expressing their thoughts, desires and feelings appropriately through movement of body and media of arts. The expressive group arts psychotherapy provided positive effects on self-expression and interactions. Second, according to the results of the interpersonal differences between pre and posttest, a mean score of pretest was 3.23 (SD = .61), the mean score of posttest was 3.61 (SD = .41). The results statistically showed significant difference (t = -3.00, p < .05). The results suggested that the expressive group arts psychotherapy gave the patient a positive impact on mental health by providing positive interactions, supports, experiences and accomplishment. Third, the results of K-HTP drawing tests, an emotional state, desire, an individual psychological dynamics, and interactions with others showed positive changes on the results of pre and posttest. The results of the pretest of K-HTP drawings, the patients showed a negative themes such as an emotional anxiety, inner conflict, social disconnection and avoidance with interpersonal relationships, pathological fantasies and aggressive self-fulfillment. On the other hand, the results of the posttest, the patients showed an improvement of interpersonal relationships and the changes of self by awareness of the reality from delusion and fantasy by having an emotional stability and interaction. This results showed that the patients experienced positive effects on the expression and awareness of self through the expressive group arts psychotherapy. Finally, the results of the qualitative analysis through the process of expressive group arts psychotherapy, the study found three themes of ‘self-expression’ through expression of feelings, expression of opinion, and self-disclosure, ‘interaction’ through intimacy and confidence, and ‘awareness of reality’ through awareness of situation and plan. These results of expressive group arts psychotherapy coincided with Yalom’s therapeutic factors of group psychotherapy, which ‘self-expression’ coincide with ‘catharsis’, ‘interaction’ coincide with ‘installation of hope’ and ‘group cohesiveness’, and ‘awareness of reality’ coincide with ‘development of socializing techniques’ and interpersonal learning’. herefore, the results of the qualitative and quantitative analysis found that the expressive group arts psychotherapy showed positive effects on self expression and interaction of the patients with chronic schizophrenia who stayed in rehabilitation facility by providing an emotional stability for the patients who had difficulty in anxiety and psychological problems."
"Statistical Downscaling for Daily Precipitation in Korea Using Combined PRISM, RCM, and Quantile Mapping: Part 1, Methodology and Evaluation in Historical Simulation",2016,"['PRISM', 'RCM', 'quantile mapping', 'PRIDE', 'high-resolution', 'precipitation', 'statistical downscaling']",,"In this study, we present the Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM)-based Dynamic downscaling Error correction (PRIDE) model, which is suitable for complex topographies, such as the Korean peninsula. The PRIDE model is constructed by combining the PRISM module, the Regional Climate Model (RCM) anomaly, and quantile mapping (QM) to produce high-resolution (1 km) grid data at a daily time scale. The results show that the systematic bias of the RCM was significantly reduced by simply substituting the climatological observational seasonal cycle at a daily timescale for each grid point obtained from the PRISM. QM was then applied to correct additional systematic bias by constructing the transfer functions under the cumulative density function framework between the model and observation using six types of transfer functions. K-fold cross-validation of the PRIDE model shows that the number of modeled precipitation days is approximately 90~121% of the number of observed precipitation days for the five daily precipitation classes, indicating that the PRIDE model reasonably estimates the observational frequency of daily precipitation under a quantile framework. The relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is also discussed in the framework of the intensity of daily precipitation."
데이터마이닝을 활용한 인구집단 구성과 경제적 불평등 평가,2016,"['인구집단', '연금제도', '불평등 지수', '군집분석', '엔트로피 지수분해', 'Population groups', 'Pension', 'Economic inequality', 'Cluster analysis', 'Entropy decomposition']",,"The importance of public pension system recently has been growing because of an ageing population in Korea. One of the major purposes of public pension system is to reduce economic inequalities across population groups that have been mainly defined by a single variable such as age, income, sex, etc in the literature. This paper aims to evaluate how well the population groups are practically and clearly designed in the literature so as to specify economic inequalities across different groups.For this purpose, we investigate the retired household sample obtained from KLIPS (Korean Labor and Income Panel Study) and conduct the clustering analysis to organize population groups. The clustering analysis consists of four steps: variable selection, hierarchical clustering analysis to determine the number of clusters and centroid, non-hierarchical clustering analysis (we use K-means clustering analysis) and define population groups, and describing the characteristics of population groups. The clustering analysis divides the population into six subgroups that have similar characteristics.We compare the characteristics of the population groups obtained from the clustering analysis with those designed in the literature with respect to household, income, consumption and asset. From the comparison, we observe that the assumptions on population groups in the literature are somewhat different from the findings from the clustering analysis. In particular, the period of employment and the full-time period are significantly different from the literature. The clustering analysis reveals that the period of employment is approximately 31-45 years, which is shorter than the period of employment assumed in the literature. Furthermore, few research has clearly considered the full-time period, which accounts for 14%-45% of the total period of employment. We believe that the findings in this study provides meaningful information on how to practically organize population groups as a part of designing public pension system. For example, researchers are encouraged to consider the employment periods and full-time periods obtained from the data analysis when considering the significant impact of working periods on pension payment and benefits.Population should be well grouped so as to specify the difference in economic inequalities across groups. In general, various variables are jointly involved in determining the economic inequalities, but populations have been simply grouped by a single variable such as age, gender, education level, household size, etc. in the literature. This paper employs the Generalized Entropy (GE) measure of economic inequality and its decomposition to evaluate the contributions of several variables on the overall economic inequality. For this analysis, populations are first grouped by several variables such as clusters obtained from the analysis, sex, education level, period of employment and household size. Then, we measure the inequaltiy index and its decomposition for monthly income, monthly consumption and asset.Grouping populations using the clustering analysis specifies the economic inequality more precisely provides better measure of similarity within a group and difference between groups. This result supports the effectiveness of the clustering analysis in grouping populations."

"Toward A Reconciliation of Two Old Testament Disciplines, ‘History of Ancient Israel’ and ‘Old Testament Theology’",2016,"['Old Testament Theology', 'Normative Task', 'History of Ancient Israel']",,"This paper suggests a way of reconciliating two Old Testament disciplines, 'history of ancient Israel' and 'Old Testament theology,' considering a debate of minimalist and maximalist on the history of ancient Israel. Since J. P. Gabler, the historical discipline and the theological discipline have grown to separate enterprises in the field of Old Testament interpretation. Eichrodt and von Rad are good samples for this. The key lies in the concept of history and its assumptions.To reconcile these two Old Testament disciplines, I suggest to take some conceptual procedures. 1) A dichotomy of history versus theology as well as fact versus fiction should be overcome. For history is a kind of literature and a result of interpretation. Both history and theology are interpreted constructs. Also fiction has elements of the reality elements in it. That’s why fiction can be construed as a reality. 2) ""What it meant"" and ""what it means"" could be bridged with the help of hermeneutics, as K. Standahl pointed out. As a Korean, I suggest that Gadamer's hermeneutics of integration may be efficient. Ancient Israel and Korean experienced advanced agrarian society, which is a common ground. 3) Through the lens of dynamics of agrarian society, historical approaches to the Old Testament can be appropriated as theological interpretations for Korean faith community, in terms of ""dynamics of historical analogy."" 4) Biblical accounts may be read like a ""virtual reality"" of the computer game. Elements of fiction come from the reality. Without the real, no fiction can be construed at all. So let the Korean Old Testament theologians play with deadly seriousness the game of the Bible."

Superpixel-based Vehicle Detection using Plane Normal Vector in Dispar ity Space,2016,"['Normal Vector Computation', 'Stereo Matching', 'Superpixel Segmentation', 'Free Space Estimation', 'Vehicle Detection']",,"This paper proposes a framework of superpixel-based vehicle detection method using plane normal vector in disparity space. We utilize two common factors for detecting vehicles: Hypothesis Generation (HG) and Hypothesis Verification (HV). At the stage of HG, we set the regions of interest (ROI) by estimating the lane, and track them to reduce computational cost of the overall processes. The image is then divided into compact superpixels, each of which is viewed as a plane composed of the normal vector in disparity space. After that, the representative normal vector is computed at a superpixel-level, which alleviates the well-known problems of conventional color-based and depth-based approaches.Based on the assumption that the central-bottom of the input image is always on the navigable region, the road and obstacle candidates are simultaneously extracted by the plane normal vectors obtained from K-means algorithm. At the stage of HV, the separated obstacle candidates are verified by employing HOG and SVM as for a feature and classifying function, respectively. To achieve this, we trained SVM classifier by HOG features of KITTI training dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle detection system outperforms the conventional HOG-based methods qualitatively and quantitatively."

Superpixel-based Vehicle Detection using Plane Normal Vector in Dispar ity Space,2016,"['Normal Vector Computation', 'Stereo Matching', 'Superpixel Segmentation', 'Free Space Estimation', 'Vehicle Detection']",,"This paper proposes a framework of superpixel-based vehicle detection method using plane normal vector in disparity space. We utilize two common factors for detecting vehicles: Hypothesis Generation (HG) and Hypothesis Verification (HV). At the stage of HG, we set the regions of interest (ROI) by estimating the lane, and track them to reduce computational cost of the overall processes. The image is then divided into compact superpixels, each of which is viewed as a plane composed of the normal vector in disparity space. After that, the representative normal vector is computed at a superpixel-level, which alleviates the well-known problems of conventional color-based and depth-based approaches. Based on the assumption that the central-bottom of the input image is always on the navigable region, the road and obstacle candidates are simultaneously extracted by the plane normal vectors obtained from K-means algorithm. At the stage of HV, the separated obstacle candidates are verified by employing HOG and SVM as for a feature and classifying function, respectively. To achieve this, we trained SVM classifier by HOG features of KITTI training dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle detection system outperforms the conventional HOG-based methods qualitatively and quantitatively."

It is considered consumption characteristics as a significant analysis subject in terms of social welfare because it could be understood as an expressed need which was a reflection of desire. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the consumption characteristics of the elderly households by stereotyping the consumption pattern of the elderly households, and find the determining factors for consumption patterns and thus contribute to the establishment of related policies through the expressed needs of the elderly households. K-means of cluster analysis was performed by putting the consumption expenditure of the elderly households to investigate inherent structural type of consumption pattern of the elderly households, which were the investigation subjects. As a result, four groups were stereotyped and named as below: ‘health care-centered type’, ‘saving-centered type’, ‘livelihood-centered type’, and ‘food expenses-centered type’ Binary Logistic Regression analysis was used to identify the factors that influence the decision of consumption pattern of the elderly households. The result of study showed that the elderly households faced all different needs and problems and thus there is a need for various approach plans to solve this situation. In particular, although the elderly have been viewed as economically poor people so far, the study showed that there were also kind of prepared households through saving. Overall, livelihood- centered type accounted for the highest portion and, as a factor that influenced this, marital state and household income played an important role. Therefore, it is considered that more active efforts to increase the income of the elderly households are needed. In addition, age, owning of house and subjective health state were found to also have significant influence. Through these results of the study, the elderly’s own improvement of awareness on health, presentation of overall standard for health state of the elderly, securement of the elderly’s access to cultural life, and financial management coordination for improvement of quality of life, development and dissemination of jobs suitable for the elderly, and dissemination of communal life household, which is a cooperation residential type, were presented as institutional task in the conclusion."

Āyurveda seeks not only physical health and longevity, but also complete health of body and soul (mokṣa). In this sense, Āyurveda embraces health-views accumulated from the modern and contemporary times. Āyurvedic understanding of human body is different from mechanistic views of human body based on Newtonian physics. It does not define human body as a material just oriented by time and space, rather as a continuing flow and process. This kind of understanding on human body adopts the same stance as quantum physics to understand material particles as a process made up of constantly changing waves as elements of the world. According to Āyurveda, it is agni that leads each element of human body to preserve dynamic constancy as a changing process. In this regard, it is within bounds to say that agni is a core concept of medical science system of Āyurveda. Agni is an essence of health (svāthya). Agni is a root(mūla) and the most significant supporting factor of all living things. The internal medicine (kāya-cikitsā), a core element of Āyurveda is identical to preserving agni, which directly shows the importance of agni in Āyurveda.  The purpose of this paper is to define the meaning of agni in Āyurveda. Many kinds of therapy and mechanism of Āyurveda are already being employed in various ways in domestic markets related to yoga, beauty, oriental medicine, psychical cure, etc. Despite this fact, the concept of agni in Āyurveda has not been studied in a detailed and systematic fashion. In this study, first of all, the process of agni""s being developed in the medical system of Āyurveda is reviewed from the historic viewpoint and then the meaning of agni in Āyurveda is defined. In the second chapter, the process of agni""s being developed is examined in Veda and saḍdarśana. Here, the paper looks at the symbolic and physical meaning of the Agni in Ṛg-veda and the process of agni""s being developed and its meaning in Sāṃkhya and Vaiṣeśika. In the third chapter, the paper deals with the concept of agni in Caraka-saṃhitā, Suśuruta-saṃhitā and Aṣṭāṅga Hṛdayam, the major scriptures of Āyurveda. In the fourth chapter, the study defines various meanings of agni concept in the medical system of Āyurveda by examining major concepts, such as pitta, ama, buddhi, soma, etc., related to agni in Āyurveda."
독일 낭만주의 문학과 사상에서 나타난 ‘밤’의 상징적 의미 - 노발리스의 「밤의 찬가」와 니체의 「밤의 노래」를 중심으로,2016,"['니체', '노발리스', '밤', '낭만주의', '예술', 'Nietzsche', 'Novalis', 'Night', 'Romanticism', 'Art..']","이 글은 본 논문은 18세기말경에 활동한 독일의 초기 낭만주의자인 노발리스와 19세기의 독일철학자 프리드리히 니체의 작품에 공통적으로 내재된 ‘밤’의 분위기와 그 상징적 의미에 대한 비교연구이다. 두 사람의 활동기간이 길게는 거의 1세기 가까이 차이가 남에도 불구하고, 그들의 문체와 사상에는 다양한 유사성이 발견된다. 그들은 예술의 중요성을 강조하고, 자신들의 작품을 통해 예술과 사상의 결합을 시도하였다. 노발리스가 철학적 예술가였다면, 니체는 예술적 철학자였다. 경계를 넘어서려는 이들의 시도는 독일적인 사유의 지평을 확대하였음은 물론이고, 예술가적 창조의 전형을 보여주었다. ‘밤’은 예술적 직관이 가장 왕성하게 작용하도록 하는 상상과 꿈의 시간이다. 노발리스에게 신성한 ‘밤’은 모든 시공간의 구분이 사라지고 태초의 시간으로 되돌아가는 순간이며, 니체에게 깊은 ‘밤’인 자정은 위대한 정오로도 통하는 ‘영원회귀’의 시간이기도 하다. 이러한 신비주의적 시간인 ‘밤’의 관점에서 볼 때 낭만주의자로서의 니체의 모습이 드러난다. 디오니소스적 시간인 ‘밤’은 어둡지만, 인간의 상상력을 최대한 자극시키는 가장 창조인 시간이기 때문이다.","This paper explores the meaning and atmosphere of ‘Night’ in Novalis(autonym: Friedrich von Hardenberg,1772-1801) and Nietzsche(1844-1900). Novalis had a very short literary career in the late 18th century, and Nietzsche published his writings from 1872 to 1889. Although they lived and wrote in different periods, they had many affinities in style and thought. Both stressed the importance of art, therefore, tried to produce a combination of art and philosophy. If Novalis was an philosophical artist(poet), Nietzsche was artistic philosopher. They attempted to overcome the limits of separate and individual disciplines, expanding the horizon of German thought and literature. ‘Night’ is a German motive that was commonly discovered in their writings. In German thought and Romantic literature, ‘Night’ is the time of dream and imagination. In Novalis’s “The Hymn of the Night”, the holy ‘Night’ is the moment that makes a division of time and space disappear. According to his diary, he saw a phantasm of his dead fiancee, Sophie von Kühn and composed a poem about this experience. He sang ‘Night’ as a time of ‘eros’ and salvation. His poems seem to be Christian on the surface, but have German mystical tradition behind the text. This trend served as a basis for Jena Romanticism. In Nietzsche’s Thus spoke Zarathustra, the ‘mid-night’ connects with noon. Nietzsche as a Dionysian thinker had a special interest in the ‘night’ that Dionysus became to prevail over Apollo. In Zarathustra’s “the Night-Song”, Nietzsche sang of an innermost psychological state. He described his own loneliness in seeking a wisdom. Here, he thought of himself as a singer of Dithyramb. In “the Sleepwalker’s Song”, Zarathustra expressed the disappearance of distinctions in time and space. At Dionysian night, all opposition disappears and the riddle of “eternal recurrence” is solved. This mysterious ‘Night’ made Nietzsche a kind of romanticist who dreamed of an artistic illusion."

Regardless of the fact that the three episodes of “sharing the seat”, “picking up a flower”, and “displaying both legs” originated from India or China, each episode was connected to the Chan (K. Seon, 禪) claim of separation from and even of superiority to Jiao(敎, doctrines) in medieval China. However, “Samcheojeonsim” was first used in Korean Seon texts as an umbrella term for those three episodes. It was also in Korea that the religious meaning of the existence of multiple mind-transmission episodes was sought for the first time in Chan and Seon history. In particular, the 19th century JoseonSeon master BaekpaGeungseon (白坡亘璇) justified the superiority of the Linji (K. Imje臨濟) school, which the Korean Seon community of the time claimed to be affiliated with, through his hierarchical interpretation of the term. His interpretation has generated various discussions and controversies on the origin and meaning of the term. Such pre-modern figures as ChouiUisun(草衣意恂), KimJeong-hui(金正喜), and SeolduYuhyeong(雪竇有炯), as well as modern scholars, including NukariyaKaiten(忽滑谷快天), Bak Han-yeong(朴漢永), and Kim Dong-hwa(金東華) also joined the discussions. This paper explores the implications of the term, “Samcheojeonsim”, from the perspective of the history of East Asian Buddhist thought by examining those discussions."

In the big data age, there are too many information sources to refer to when making decisions. For example, when considering travel to a city, a person may search reviews from a search engine such as Google or social networking services (SNSs) such as blogs, Twitter, and Facebook. The emotional polarity of positive and negative reviews helps a user decide on whether or not to make a trip. Sentiment analysis of customer reviews has become an important research topic as datamining technology is widely accepted for text mining of the Web. Sentiment analysis has been used to classify documents through machine learning techniques, such as the decision tree, neural networks, and support vector machines (SVMs). is used to determine the attitude, position, and sensibility of people who write articles about various topics that are published on the Web. Regardless of the polarity of customer reviews, emotional reviews are very helpful materials for analyzing the opinions of customers through their reviews. Sentiment analysis helps with understanding what customers really want instantly through the help of automated text mining techniques. Sensitivity analysis utilizes text mining techniques on text on the Web to extract subjective information in the text for text analysis. Sensitivity analysis is utilized to determine the attitudes or positions of the person who wrote the article and presented their opinion about a particular topic.  In this study, we developed a model that selects a hot topic from user posts at Chinas online stock forum by using the k-means algorithm and self-organizing map (SOM). In addition, we developed a detecting model to predict a hot topic by using machine learning techniques such as logit, the decision tree, and SVM. We employed sensitivity analysis to develop our model for the selection and detection of hot topics from China’s online stock forum. The sensitivity analysis calculates a sentimental value from a document based on contrast and classification according to the polarity sentimental dictionary (positive or negative).  The online stock forum was an attractive site because of its information about stock investment. Users post numerous texts about stock movement by analyzing the market according to government policy announcements, market reports, reports from research institutes on the economy, and even rumors. We divided the online forum’s topics into 21 categories to utilize sentiment analysis. One hundred forty-four topics were selected among 21 categories at online forums about stock. The posts were crawled to build a positive and negative text database. We ultimately obtained 21,141 posts on 88 topics by preprocessing the text from March 2013 to February 2015. The interest index was defined to select the hot topics, and the k-means algorithm and SOM presented equivalent results with this data. We developed a decision tree model to detect hot topics with three algorithms: CHAID, CART, and C4.5. The results of CHAID were subpar compared to the others. We also employed SVM to detect the hot topics from negative data. The SVM models were trained with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel function by a grid search to detect the hot topics.  The detection of hot topics by using sentiment analysis provides the latest trends and hot topics in the stock forum for investors so that they no longer need to search the vast amounts of information on the Web. Our proposed model is also helpful to rapidly determine customers’ signals or attitudes towards government policy and firms’ products and services."

Also, It is an unique document that records our country's case missing from China.“Chinjanggyŏng” that called a crucial part of Suksunyŏm admits to limits of eye, ear(s) and heart, and orders accessing the nature of things passing the limit of existing perceptions. Also, It emphasizes Chinji and Chinhak, denies an absolute value, and recognizes things as a relative viewpoint. Furthermore, it sets a high value on Sŏnbyŏn in a sentence, recognizes sentence as living things, and announces that letter never dies. So it offers possibility as an open text from Suksunyŏm based on this world view and literary speculation.Suksunyŏm has possibility as an open text compared traditional books. Especially, “Kyegwan” wants reader to aspire to take an active part not to accept one-sidedly in a passive position. Also, he emphasized the need to organize and compile Korean Literature and though there was no real books, he wrote a preface such as “Tongguksŏngnidaejŏnsŏ”, “Tonggukkŭnsaroksŏ”, “Tongsesŏlsŏ”, “Tongsamullyuch'wisŏ” etc. If so, Suksunyŏm is open to everyone as an unfinished book.Suksunyŏm means that who will achieve their desire? Or desire that someone will achieve. But Suksunyŏm does not mean fixed the world, it is possible to interpret various meanings. Polysemy of Suksunyŏm offers to continue to research from a variety of perspectives up to this day.At that time, People evaluated Suksunyŏm as pleasure such as Changjo evaluated “Changch'wiwŏn'gi” as a pleasure writing. Also, Pak, Che-ka realized that it expressed a big dream of deprived classical scholar similar to “Changch'wiwŏn'gi”. On the other hand, Hong, u-gŏn admitted a pleasure writing and imparted meanings.

MORAL SUCCESS AND FAILURE IN THE ETHICAL THEORY OF TASAN CHŎNG YAGYONG,2016,"['Moral success', 'moral agency', 'kwŏnhyŏng', 'cogitative mechanism of the spiritual body', 'inference of others’ minds from one’s own']",,"This study analyzes factors associated with moral success and failure in the ethical theory of Chŏng Yagyong (1762–1836), better known as Tasan. According to researchers who emphasize the cognitive and conative role of moral sentiments, moral success is ultimately driven by Tasan’s “moral mind” or “innate moral inclination.” According to them, moral sentiments are not blind, capricious feelings, but are able to intuitively perceive and discern good and evil; only by faithfully following one’s innate inclination toward good, is one well on the road to moral success.Tasan, however, in analyzing criminal acts in Hŭmhŭm sinsŏ (欽欽 新書; A new book on criminal law), notices a curious kind of moral failure caused by a strong moral emotion or passion toward socially endorsed moral virtues such as loyalty, filial piety and fidelity. Without much reflection on one’s inner mind or consideration on the proper method of one’s action, people fall prey to their “moral” emotions and commit crimes like taking revenge on the wrong person or committing suicide for the wrong reason. In his ethical theory, naturally, Tasan emphasizes not only moral sentiments and willpower but also the judging and weighing function of the mind, i.e., the cogitative mechanism of the spirit called kwŏnhyŏng (C. quanheng 權衡), literally meaning weighing and balancing.In this article, I attempt to describe the cogitative function of kwŏnhyŏng as judgment and decision and conclude that it is the actual and essential moral agency in Tasan’s ethical theory. Kwŏnhyŏng estimates and judges the issue at hand by inferring principles (K. ch’uri; C. tuili 推理), which is reminiscent of the rational and intellectual inference in Thomism. Although Tasan’s ethical theory was much influenced by Thomistic tradition, Tasan uniquely interprets “inferring the principle” as “inferring others’ minds from one’s own” (K. ch’usŏ; C. tuishu 推恕), which is a purely Confucian notion distinct from that presumed by Jesuit missionaries."

An academic university major in cartoons and animation studies established in late 20th century however, did not satisfactorily meet the needs in academic research and development and the free expression of artistic creation was limited. In order to systematize the major in cartoons and animation studies, an convergent approach to establish and clarify following are in demand : the terms and definitions, the historical developments, the research areas and methods, the major education and related jobs and start-ups.  New culture and arts industries including cartoons, animation, moving images, and games contents are not yet listed in the industries listing service jointly provided online by the portal site Naver.com and Hyung-Seol publishing company. Above all, cartoons and animation are inseparably related to each other that even if one uses the term separately and independently, the meaning may not be complete. So a new combined term ""Animatoon"" can be established for the major in cartoons and animation studies and also used for its degree with concentrations of cartoons, animation, moving images, games, and etc.  In the Introduction, a new combined term Animatoon is defined and explained the use of this term as the name of the major and degree in cartoons and animation studies.  In the body, first, the Historical Developments classified Animatoon in the ancient times, the medieval times, and the modern times and they are analyzed with the help of esthetics and arts using examples of mural frescos, animal painting, religion cartoons, caricatures, cartoons, satire cartoons, comics, animation, 2 or 3 dimensional webtoons, and K-toons.  Second, the Research Areas of Animatoon reviewed the theories, genres, artworks, and artists and the Research Methods of Animatoon presented the curriculum that integrated the courses in humanities, science technologies, culture and arts, and etc.  Third, the Major Education considered Animatoon education in children, young adults, students of the major and the Related Jobs and Start-Ups explored various jobs relating to personal creation of artwork and collective production of business-oriented artwork.  In the Conclusion, the current challenges of Animatoon considered personalization of the artists, specialization of the contents, diversification of the types, and liberalization of the art creation. And the direction of improvement advocated Animatoon to be an academic field of study, to be an art, to be a culture, and to be an industry. The importance of cartoons and animation along with videos and games rose in the 21st century. In order for cartoons and animation to take a leading role, make efforts in studying Animatoon academically and also in developing Animatoon as good contents in the cultural industries."

Seon) master Jewoldang Gyeongheon(霽月堂 敬軒 1544～1633) was a disciple of Cheongheo Hyujeong(淸虛 休靜) who entered the Buddhist priesthood at the age of fifteen and immersed himself in Buddhist practice for 75 years until he died at 91. He was well versed in Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism and was also so thorough about keeping Buddhist commandments that he practiced ‘silence asceticism’ for many years. He distinguished himself at the Imjin War and received a letter of appointment to the governmental office from King Seonjo. However, he refused to take the post and devoted himself on Buddhist practice and edification of his students. He was an exemplary priest who practiced both Zen and Doctrinal (K. Gyo) Buddhism, a practice perception of Joseon Buddhism, and played an important role on establishing the tradition of Buddhist education that is called ‘Enter Zen via Gyo(由敎入禪)’.  After his death, Gyeongheon’s disciples collected the ashes of his body after cremation ceremony and erected a pagoda and stupa. In 1636(the 14th year of King Injo’s reign), his student named Seolhyeon(雪玄) installed, to pay a tribute to Gyeongheon’s charitable deeds, ‘the Epitaph of Grand Master Jewoldang (K. Jewoldangdaesabi)’ in Simwon Temple on Mt. Bogae. Dragons and clouds are engraved beautifully on the head of the stele. The epitaph was composed by Commandant of Dongyang Sin Ikseong and written by King Seonjo’s fourth prince Lord of Uichang Lee Gwang. His epitaph was shipped to Jingpa Port from Hongseong, South Chungcheong Province and then transferred by 5,600 soldiers, monks and people on land. In the following year (the 15th year of King Injo’s reign), his disciples published the Literary Collection of Grand Master Jewoldang (K. Jewoldangdaesajip) as well.  In the early 17th century, it was said that there were three religious traditions of Zen Buddhism in Joseon. The disciples of Gyeongheon, the School of Jewol(霽月派) asserted the religious tradition of Imje-Naong which means that they received the mantle handed down through Naong(懶翁), Younggwan(靈觀), Hyujeong(休靜), and Gyeongheon. Because it was the recognition of one school’s religious tradition by the Buddhist society that determines the status of the school, Buddhists at the time engrossed in establishing the identity and authenticity of their schools via erecting a stone stele and publishing an anthology of their masters. The fact that Gyeongheon’s disciples such as Doil(道一) visited Sin Ikseong, who was renowned as a fine prose writer, several times to ask him to compose the epitaph, erected Jewoldangdaesabi, and compiled Jewoldangdaesajip can be understood as an effort to secure the School of Jewol’s legitimacy by highly praising Gyeongheon’s."

A total of 145 Buddhist temples, hermitages, and other venues for practicing Buddhism on Jiri Mountain are mentioned in the Beomcheon Chongpyo chapter of the book. Brief sketches of the history of those Buddhist venues found in the chapter are important historical sources for relevant research. These sketches suggest the existence of Buddhist monasteries in the area during the 19th century. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a detailed analysis of the narrating attitude and features of the author and to elucidate the books' Buddhist historical significance and cultural meaning. Five theories of the narrating attitude and features of the author are derived during the course of this analysis. First, simple historical facts of Buddhism on Jiri Mountain are written in an encyclopedic style. Second, most of the entries in the Beomcheon Chongpyo chapter are quoted from records which existed at the time. These include the Augmented Survey of the Geography of Korea (K. Sinjeung Dongkuk Yeoji Seungnam), local gazettes, and private literary collections. Third, several quotations are cited without explaining the author's intention or indicating the source of the sentence. Fourth, historic sites that had not been dealt with in the Beomcheon Chongpyo chapter are described in the following chapter titled Gojeokcha. Fifth, the author did not thoroughly review the contents and consequently there are mistakes in the book. Three accounts of the Buddhist historical significance of the book are also derived during the course of analysis. First, it can be regarded as an encyclopedia of Buddhist monasteries on Jiri Mountain during the 19th century. Second, the Confucian scholars' perception of Buddhism at that time is evident in the book. Third, the fact that the first entry of the of the Beomcheon Chongpyo chapter describes the Shrine of the Mountain Spirit (K. Seongmosa 聖母祠) can be understood as evidence of the collaboration of Buddhism and Shamanism at the time."
MORAL SUCCESS AND FAILURE IN THE ETHICAL THEORY OF TASAN CHŎNG YAGYONG,2016,"['Moral success', 'moral agency', 'kwŏnhyŏng', 'cogitative mechanism of the spiritual body', 'inference of others’ minds from one’s own']",,"This study analyzes factors associated with moral success and failure in the ethical theory of Chŏng  Yagyong (1762–1836), better known as Tasan.

동양주의와 옥시덴탈리즘 사이: 김환기의 전반기 그림,2016,"['Kim', 'Whanki', 'Dongyang-ism', 'Oxidentalism', 'traditional crafts', 'nature', 'culture of literary man', 'Korean Modernism', '김환기', '동양주의', '옥시덴탈리즘', '전통기물', '자연', '문인문화', '한국적 모더니즘']","김환기(1913-1974)의 전반기(前半期)(1948-1963) 그림들은 소위 ‘한국적 모더니즘’의 효시로 일컬어진다. 이는 당대 한국의 특수한 문화지정학적 위치를 드러내는 독특한 결과물이라는 점에서다. 그러한 위치는 동양주의와 옥시덴탈리즘, 그리고 둘 간의 관계를 통해 드러난다. 전통문화로부터 내려 온 정체성을 계승하려는 의지와 근대화를 이끈 서구 주류미술을 수용하려는 요구가 그의 그림에서 교차하는 것이다. 즉, 그의 그림에는 전통기물과 자연이라는 정체성의 기호와 모던하고 인공적인 양식이라는 근대성의 기호가 공존하며, 형식 또한 구상적 이미지들과 추상적 구성, 기하학적 구조와 비정형의 필치와 재질감 모두를 포괄한다. 그의 그림은 자국의 전통문화와 선진제국의 당대적 미술에 동시에 노출된 제3세계 화가의 문화지정학적 위치를 드러내는 것이다. 더불어, 이질적인 요소들을 아우르는 그의 그림에서는 서구 근대의 이분법적 논리를 벗어난 ‘포용(inclusion)’의 원리를 읽을 수 있다. 이러한 원리는 동양문화의 전통에서 그 뿌리를 찾을 수 있는 점에서, 그의 그림은 외래문화를 자국의 전통을 통해 재해석한 능동적 문화수용의 한 예로 볼 수 있다. 서로 다른 차이들, 그리고 그것들 간의 관계를 드러내는 그의 그림은 문화의 의미를 “제3의 공간(the third space)” 즉 “사이(the in-between)”의 공간에 두고자 한, 따라서 문화의 혼성성(hybridity)을 강조한 호미 바바(Homi K. Bhabha) 이론의 좋은 범례다. 김환기는 이미 오래 전에 바바의 이론을 그림을 통해 예시한 셈이다. 그의 그림은 동양과 서양의 사이뿐 아니라 동양주의와 옥시덴탈리즘의 사이를 드러낸다. 이 둘 사이에서 나름의 해결책을 찾아 온 과정을 그의 그림에서 추적할 수 있는 것이다. 그에게 동양주의는 옥시덴탈리즘에 대한 하나의 반응이고 옥시덴탈리즘 또한 동양주의의 다른 얼굴인 셈이다.","The first half (1948-1963) of Kim Whanki’s (1913-1974) artistic career marks the beginning of what is called “Korean Modernism.” For Kim’s work of this period is the idiosyncratic output that brings to light the particular cultural geopolitical location of Korea at that time. That location is revealed via Dongyang-ism, Oxidentalism, and the relation between them. In other words, two different aspects overlap in his art: the will to continue the identity of traditional culture and the demand for the reception of the mainstream art from the West which led modernization. This is fully demonstrated through his use of subjects and forms. To elaborate, his art can be characterized by the coexistence of the signs of identity such as traditional crafts and nature and those of modernity including modernist and artificial forms. And as for formal aspect, it is defined by the mutual compatibility among figurative images and abstract composition, geometric structure and spontaneous brushworks and textures. That is, Kim’s painting is an index of the cultural geopolitical location of the Third-World painters who were simultaneously exposed both to their own traditional cultures and the artistic practices prevailed in developed countries. While encompassing different elements, his painting also reveals the principle of “inclusion”, which differs from dichotomic logic of the Western modernity. In the respect that this is rooted in the cultural traditions of Eastern Asia, Kim’s art is a paragon of the active acceptance of other cultures-that is the reinterpretation of foreign cultures through the filter of one’s own tradition. Showing differences and the relationships between them, his paintings become paradigmatic examples of Homi K. Bhabha’s theoretical formulation, which locates the meaning of culture in “the third space”, namely in “the in-between”, and thereby underlines the hybridity of culture. It is fair to say that Kim’s pictorial endeavors already illustrated Bhabha’s theory long ago. His paintings articulate “the in-between” of Dongyang-ism and Oxidentalism as well as that of the East and the West. One can trace in his paintings the process of his search for solutions in that “in-between” space as Kim Whanki Dongyang-ism is a response to Oxidentalism and the latter is the other side of the former."

Ten healthy males (50.30±10.65yrs) and thirty eight females (53.29±7.36yrs) without any chronic disease were participated in this study. The participants were wearing Actigraph and K4b2 during all experiment and performed three selected types of settings in treadmill, daily physical activities, and free-living. Epoch of Actigraph was set at 1 second, and K4b2were collected breath-by-breath data. Those data were converted to MET values with 60second epoch. Obtained MET values from the criterion measure and Actigrph accelerometer were compared to calculated median, mean, and standard deviations as well as Mean Absolute and Relative Percent Error. Paired t-test was applied to examine the statistical differences of the MET values. To determine the accuracy of the categorization of the physical activity intensity, percent (%) of the correct assignments were calculated. All statistical analysis was calculated by SPSS 20.0 and Stata 12 with α<.05. As a result of the study, overeall Freedson (1998) equation was most accurately estimating MET values comparing to other equations. Troiano (2008) cut-point was precisely classified the intensity of the physical activity among the various cut-points, but not Freedson VM (2011). Advanced technology to estimate physical activity levels should be applied to reduce the error rate of predicting physical activity levels in the near future."

It refers not only to refined writing in Literary Chinese, but also to more utilitarian public and private writings in Literary Chinese composed in the context of daily life. Thus, “Sino-Korean literature” includes not only literary writings but also historical records, scholarly essays, public documents such as diplomatic correspondence, and private texts such as correspondence in Literary Chinese. Works in Literary Chinese with interspersed vernacular expressions as well as works using Chinese characters phonetically to inscribe the Korean language. Korean literary Chinse prose includes all forms of prose of narrative genre except novel and its main stream is ancient-style prose (古文). However, from the early stage of Korean history of literature, Koreanstyle Chinese (including “clerical reading” [吏讀]) and parallel prose (四六文) developed in addition to literary Chinese namely ancient-style prose, and it was since mid Koryeo period that ancient-style prose has been mainstreamed. In late Joseon literati developed literary Chinese prose appropriating classicist prose based on Qin and Han models (秦漢古文, 擬古文) and essays (小品). Studies of literary Chinse prose had been long focused on Park Jiwon`s works until 1980`s when studies on criticism theories on literary Chinse prose, essays in late Joseon, classicist prose based on Qin and Han models, main ideas of literary Chinse prose, historical changes of criticism and its methodology etc. began to be paid attention. In the Joseon Dynasty the majority of authors belonged to the yangban elite : accordingly, their literary works focused on supporting the successful governance of the dynasty (經國文章). However, In the late Joseon Dynasty, as the hierarchy of Confucian scholars diversified, poor scholars who shared living space with the middle and lower classes of society created their own new literary world that they found a deeper meaning to his literary activities in a daily life where scholars and ordinary people coexisted in harmony. Late Joseon literati were also affected by Yuan Hongdao`s that they emphasized the immediacy of true feelings in literary expression. This article surveys Korean history of literary Chinse prose based on existing research results and suggests tasks to be solved henceforth."

The research subjects for the quantitative analysis were 56 gifted children with ADHD, those with an IQ of 125 or higher amongst children who were diagnosed with ADHD and the 56 mothers of these children. In order to supplement the results of quantitative research, qualitative research was held through in-depth interviews with eight of the mothers of the gifted children with ADHD.First, the factor analysis shows that gifted children with ADHD showed significantly higher performance in verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, freedom from distractibility, processing speed indexes amongst the K-WISC-Ⅲ. However, they didn’t show significant differences in shape pairing tests. This suggests that gifted children with ADHD lacks alacrity, spontaneity, cognitive flexibility, and show consistent effort in ambiguous contexts.Second, in the subdivision of creativity, gifted children with ADHD showed significantly higher performance in fluency, elaboration, abstractness of title, and resistance to premature closure. However, they did not show significant differences in originality. The intellectual capacity of gifted children with ADHD were rather discouraged connection to new methods. Furthermore, the criterion of counting the number of responses within a given time period has affected the originality of the gifted children with ADHD who tend to show in-depth attention to their interest.Third, gifted children with ADHD showed dominant attention deficit. Furthermore, this suggests a possibility of this problem not being recognized by parents or teachers in comparison to those ordinary children with ADHD who externalize this problem.Fourth, in comparison to ordinary children with ADHD, gifted children with ADHD showed significantly higher anxiety, depression, and delinquency. This means gifted children with ADHD experience difficulty in conducting emotional behaviour.Fifth, there were no significant differences in the result of quantitative research in parenting efficacy between mothers of ordinary children with ADHD and mothers of gifted children with ADHD, and it was also confirmed that mothers of gifted children with ADHD feel difficulties in parenting as well. The reasoning was analyzed by qualitative research methods and the results are as follows: mothers of gifted children accept and admit the child’s twice exceptionality, then experience misbehavior which leads to the perception that they lack parenting skills and knowledge required to nurture such child.Sixth, quantitative research was carried out on parenting stress i	n mothers of gifted children with ADHD and mothers of ordinary children with ADHD. Results showed that there are significantly higher stress in mothers of gifted children with ADHD related to their child, child’s temperament, and expectation in academics. Qualitative research results also support that mothers of gifted children with ADHD suffers with various types of stress.Seventh, the results of the quantitative research on the attitude in parenting of mothers of gifted children with ADHD and mothers of ordinary children with ADHD show that mothers of gifted children with ADHD have significantly low aggression, hostility, and coercive parenting attitude. Qualitative research showed this positive parenting attitude is derived from the mothers’ effort to appropriately react and fight the stress by understanding and accommodating the child’s twice exceptionality."
중소기업플러스보험에 관한 연구,2016,"['중소기업', '수출장려', '수출보험', '무역보험', '한국무역보험공사', '면책사유', '약관정비', '제도개선', 'small and medium-sized businesses', 'encouragement of exportation', 'export insurance', 'trade insurance', 'Korea Trade Insurance Corporation', 'cause of exemption', 'adjustment of standard terms', 'reform of institute']","우리나라는 수출을 기반으로 성장한 전형적인 국가이다. 일반적으로 무역보험은 수출입무역, 기타 대외거래의 건전한 발전을 도모하기 위하여 대외거래에서 생기는 어음거래의 제한이나 기타 통상적인 보험으로는 구제되지 않는 위험을 담보하는 제도이다. 무역보험의 기능으로는 무역거래 상의 불안제거, 금융공급 확대와 금융시스템의 건전성 향상, 무역진흥 정책수단, 시장지향적 무역관리, 효과적인 경제협력 수단 등을 들 수 있다. 무역보험 가운데 하나로서 중소기업플러스보험이 있다. 중소기업플러스보험이라 함은 보험계약자인 수출기업은 연간 보상한도에 대한 보험료를 납부하며, 수입자 위험, 신용장 위험, 수입국 위험 등 보험계약자가 선택한 담보위험으로 손실이 발생할 때 공사는 책임금액 범위 내에서 손실을 보상하는 보험을 지칭한다. 원래 단기수출보험이 개별 수출거래 건별로 보험계약이 체결된 것이다. 그런데 중소기업플러스보험에서는 수출기업의 전체 수출거래를 대상으로 위험별 책임금액을 설정하여 운영하고 있다. 이는일반 손해보험(화재보험, 자동차보험 등)의 개념을 도입한 것으로 볼 수 있다. 중소기업플러스s보험은 한국무역보험공사 신용등급 기준 F급 이상의 수출기업 으로서 전년도(최근 1년간) 수출실적이 US $ 5백만 이하인 중소기업, US $ 30백만 이하의 중견기업을 대상으로 한다. 한편 중소기업플러스보험에서도 일반보험에서처럼 보험계약자의 의무에 대하여 일련의 규정을 두고 있다. 그런데 부분적으로는 일반보험과는 다른 내용으로 규정하고 있다. 중소기업플러스보험의 특징을 살리는 측면에서의 일반보험의 원리로부터 벗어나는 약관내용을 둘 수는 있지만 가급적이면 이곳에서도 일반보험의 원리에 맞게 약관을 구성하는 것이 바람직하다. 무역보험이 산업정책적 보험이고 공사가 운용하고 있더라도, 중소기업은 기업으로서 상인이지만 경제적으로는 약자일 수 있기 때문에 약자를 보호하는 상법상의 장치가 가동되는 것이 바람직하다. 한편 중소기업플러스보험의 경우 수입자신용조사를 하지 않는 특징이 있다. 그런데 수입자신용조사를 하지 않고 무역보험을 인수하는 것은 무역사기사건에 연루되는 것을 거르지 못할 위험성이 있다. 최근에 모뉴엘 무역사기사건에서는 현지공장을 가장하여 실제 조사를 나갔어도 그 때만 공장을 가동하는 것으로 포장하여 무역사기를 적발해내지 못한 경우까지도 존재하였었다. 그리하여 중소기업플러스보험에서는 공사가 비용이 허용하는 한도에서의 최소의 신용조사를 하는 쪽으로 제도를 개선하여 운용하는 것이 필요하다. 수입자신용조사를 하지 않고 무역보험을 인수하는 것은 무역사기사건에 연루되는 것을 거르지 못할 위험성이 있다. 최근에 모뉴엘 무역사기사건에서는 현지공장을 가장하여 실제 조사를 나갔어도 그 때만 공장을 가동하는 것으로 포장하여 무역사기를 적발해내지 못한 경우까지도 존재하였었다. 그리하여 중소기업플러스보험에서는 공사가 비용이 허용하는 한도에서의 최소의 신용조사를 하는 쪽으로 제도를 개선하여 운용하는 것이 필요하다. 대한민국은 천연자원은 부족하지만 인재와 교육열을 중심으로 한 수출드라이브정책으로 성장하여 지금까지 온 것이다. 수출은 국가의 안녕과 복지를 위해서도 중요한 의미를 갖는다. 중소기업플러스보험의 제도를 합리적으로 운용하기 위한 노력과 약관정비를 통해 우리의 수출부흥에 중소중견기업플러스보험이 제 기능을 다하도록 하여야 할 것이다.","Nowadays, the export plays very important role in domestic economy and even welfare of the citizens. Fast all of states encourage and support exporting companies. The large sized company can export by pulling up himself. But the small and medium-sized businesses have problem. Therefore, the nation should support the export of small and medium-sized companies. In this meaning, the small and medium-sized business plus insurance is very important for the export increase of Korea. Korea has grown up through export. The natural resources are in Korea very few. But the man power and educational enthusiasm are very high. The trade insurance is industrial policy insurance. It is done by Korea Trade Insurance Corporation(K-Sure). The small and medium-sized business plus insurance gives the insurance guarantee about importer risk, letter of credit risk, importing nation risk etc. on the payment of premium. The small and medium-sized business plus insurance is distinct from the general Short-term Export Insurance. In the general Short-term Export Insurance, the insurance contract is concluded by each exporting matter. But in the small and medium-sized business plus insurance, the liability limit is settled for the total export trade. The small and medium-sized business plus insurance gives insurance guarantee for the company that have over F credit rating of the K-Sure. The small and medium-sized companies that have under 5 million US dollars export result in the last year can get this insurance service. The standard terms of small and medium-sized business plus insurance regulates the duty of disclosure, notice duty on double insurance, subrogation etc like general insurance. But the standard terms of the small and medium-sized business plus insurance is a little bit different from that of general insurance. We should analyse the reason rationally. And when the difference has no rational reason, then the contract terms should be reformed. We should promote the small and medium-sized business plus insurance. Through the wide inflection of this insurance, we can promote export volume, competitive power of small sized companies and the strength of our nation."

The films that are analysed in this research are the following: 〈Sonnenallee〉(1999), 〈Good Bye, Lenin!〉(2003) and 〈The Lives of Others〉(2006). These three films show the prototypical aspects of the East German society, with excellent cinematic quality and high popularity.  These films overturn the widely spread prejudices of the Western world about the East German society rather than recognizing them. 〈Sonnenallee〉 shows the unexpected similarity of values and lifestyle between the young people of the East and West. 〈The Lives of Others〉 alludes to the cherished ideals of socialism in the mind of East German intellectuals even under the rigorously controlled system and severe oppression. Lastly, 〈Good Bye, Lenin!〉 captures the destructive influence of the German reunification on a mediocre East German family, and it questions the historical meaning of the reunification from below.  Furthermore, the three films have the common feature of not ‘demonizing’ the East German society from the perspective of ‘Anti-Communism’. For example, 〈Sonnenallee〉 depicts the East German society as a community of friendship and goodwill, although the virtue has faded away after the reunification. Hence the film evokes ‘ostalgie’, nostalgia for the East. 〈The Lives of Others〉 describes an idealistic socialist in a positive way even under the overwhelming atmosphere of criticism against the Stalinistic oppressive system. In 〈Good Bye, Lenin!〉, the destruction of humanity and socialistic utopia, a result from the rapid capitalization after the reunification, is portrayed from the perspective of irony and melancholy.  In sum, these films can be characterized as ‘a dignified farewell’ to ‘the nation that has once stretched its hands to utopia’(Helga Königsdorf)."

탈식민주의 관점에서 본 버내큘러의 문화적 위상,2016,"['Vernacular(버내큘러)', 'Cultural Difference(문화적 차이)', 'Postcolonialism(탈식민주의)', 'Cultural Diversity(문화적 다양성)', 'Modern Design(모던 디자인)']","본 논문은 버내큘러에 대한 역사적 인식을 비판적으로 살펴보고, 그러한 비판을 통해 버내큘러의 새로운 위상을 고찰하고자 한 연구이다. 그동안 버내큘러는 모던 문화의 프레임 안에서 전통과 현대, 제도와 일상, 중심과 주변이라는 대립구조로 분리되었으며, 그 안에서 지엽적이고 저급한 것으로 사유되어 왔다.  그러나 버내큘러는 포스트모던 문화가 등장함에 따라 디자인의 새로운 대안으로 귀환하였으며, 나아가 ‘지역 문화’의 부상과 함께 글로컬리즘의 중요한 요소로 주목받고 있다. 하지만 이러한 상황이 버내큘러의 위상이 승격되었음을 의미하는 것은 아니다. 오히려 그것은 ‘문화적 다양성’이라는 상대주의적 전략을 구축하면서 차이를 속박하고 제거하기 위한 장치로 기능할 수 있다.  이러한 관점에서 연구자는 탈식민주의 담론을 이론적 배경으로 살펴보았다. 특히 호미 바바의 ‘문화적 차이’ 개념을 포스트 모던 문화의 키워드인 ‘다양성’이라는 프레임과 비교하여 고찰함으로써 버내큘러의 새로운 위상을 설정해 보고자 하였다.  ‘문화적 다양성’이란 용어는 다양한 문화를 반영한다는 매우 이상적인 이데올로기를 담고 있지만, 그것은 지배 문화가 허용하는 그리드 내에서만 가능한 일이며, 반면, ‘문화적 차이’는 문화적 이해와 판단의 과정에서 하나로 통합될 수 없는 의미와 가치들을 충돌시킴으로써, 동일시의 전략을 재설정하게 만든다.  또한 연구자는 이러한 논의를 끌어내기 위해 20세기 포스트모던 시대의 버내큘러에 대한 관점을 로버트 벤추리(Robert Venturi)나 할 포스터(Hal Foster) 등의 건축 이론과 디자인 저술가 엘렌 럽튼(Ellen Lupton)의 관점을 배경으로 하여 전개하였다. 연구자는 이러한 과정을 통해 버내큘러가 기존의 관점으로부터 벗어나 현재 우리의 삶속에서 재고되어야 함을 논하고자 하였다.  우리가 버내큘러를 동시대 삶 속에 내재한 ‘문화적 차이’로 인식할 수 있다면, 버내큘러는 지배문화를 공고히 하는 다양한 전략 중 하나가 아니라, ‘새로운 틈’을 창출해 내는 것으로 재분할 될 수 있으며, 그러한 과정을 통해 버내큘러는 권력의 공간이나 관계를 비판적으로 사유할 수 있는 인식의 틀로 작용할 수 있을 것이다.","This study would critically examine historical recognition on vernacular and discuss a new phase of vernacular based on those concerns. Vernacular has been regarded as the marginal and the lowbrow that could not obtain universality in the confrontational structures between tradition and modernity, between the center and the periphery, and between system and everyday life along with the birth of modern culture.  However, vernacular returned to new elements of design along with the appearance of postmodernism, and furthermore, in the geography of glocalism, attention is paid to that, along with the rise of ‘local culture.’ Yet, this phenomenon does not mean the changed phase of vernacular. It may rather function as a device to restrict and limit the difference, constructing a relativist frame of ‘cultural diversity’.  For this discussion, I applied post-colonial theory as a theoretical background. Especially, Homi K. Bhabha’s concept of ‘cultural difference’ was discussed in comparison with the frame ‘diversity,’ a keyword of post-modern culture, to set up a new phase of the vernacular.  The term, ‘cultural diversity’ contains an ideal ideology that reflects numerous cultures, but it is possible only in the grid that mainstream society or governance culture allows. On the other hand, the ‘cultural difference’ makes the strategy of identification reset by making meanings and values collide, which cannot be combined into one, in the process of cultural understanding and judgment.  In addition, the discussion of the vernacular in the post-modern era was conducted through architectural theorists like Robert Venturi or Hal Foster etc. and studies by design writer Ellen Lupton from a critical position. Through this process, this study would discuss that the vernacular should be reconsidered in our present life escaping from the existing viewpoint.  We can recognize the vernacular as a ‘cultural difference’ inherent in contemporary life, it will be subdivided into something that creates a ‘new gap’ not one of various strategies that solidify the dominant culture, and through such a process, vernacular may act as a cognitive framework by which we can critically think the space or relation of power."
발달지연 환자의 종적 추적 관찰,2016,"['Developmental delay', 'Longitudinal follow up', 'Autism spectrum disorder', 'Intellectual disability', 'Developmental language disorder']","목적: 발달지연은 학동기를 포함한 전체 소아의 5-10%에서 나타나는 비교적 흔한 질환으로 소아의 중요한 건강문제 중의 하나이다. 이들을 조기에 발견하여 적절한 조기 개입을 함으로써 장래에 초래될 수 있는 장애를 줄일 수 있을 뿐만 아니라 사회적 부담과 비용도 줄일 수 있어 조기 발견은 매우 중요하다. 이에 국민건강보험 일산병원 발달지연 클리닉에 내원한 환자 중 2번이상 추적 관찰된 환자를 대상으로 이들의 종적인 진단의 변화를 살펴보고, 최종진단이 ASD, ID, DLD의 경우, 이 세 질환을 초진 시 미리 판별할 수 있는 예측 인자를 찾아봄으로써 적절한 조기개입을 하는데 도움을 받고자 본 연구를 시행하였다.방법: 2007년 8월-2013년 7월까지 국민건강보험 일산병원 발달지연 클리닉에 내원한 환자(총 733명) 중 2번 이상 방문한 환자 168명을 대상으로 하였다. 모든 환자는 진료 시 다학제적 접근방식에 따라 소아신경과, 소아재활의학과, 소아정신과의 세 과를 동시에 방문 하였다. 초진시의 기본 검사로 언어평가, 발달평가 혹은 인지평가, 사회성 및 행동평가, 청력검사를 실시하였고, 환자에 따라 아동기자폐증평정척도(CARS), MRI, 뇌파검사, 염색체 검사, 대사이상 검사 등을 선택적으로 시행하였다. 검사 결과 및 병력청취, 진찰소견을 바탕으로 초진 시 내린 잠정진단과 재진 시의 최종진단의 변화를 의무기록 검토를 통해 후향적으로 살펴 보았다.결과: 1) 1차 방문 아동들의 평균 연령은 2.78세(4-97개월)이며, 추적 방문 아동들의 평균 연령은 4.81세(24-136개월) 이었고, 평균 추적기간은 24.8개월(8-68개월) 이었다. 2) 환자들의 가장 흔한 주 호소는 언어지연이었다(71.5%). 3) 잠정 진단과 최종 진단의 차이는 GDD와 DLD환자군에서 주로 관찰되었는데, 결국 최종진단 ID는 잠정진단 DLD에서보다 GDD에서 더 많이 이행되었으나(65.3% vs 42.3%), ASD는 두 군에서 모두 비슷한 비율로 이행되었다(16.3 vs 19.2%). 4) 초진 시 DLD 환자군 증, 비언어성 인지발달지수(C-DQ)가 정상인 환자일수록 장기적인 예후가 훨씬 양호하였다. 5) 이 변수들 중 세 군을 가장 영향력 있게 판별할 수 있는 예측 변수를 판별분석을 통해 확인해 본 결과, C-DQ (0.7436)가 가장 강력했고, 이후 SMS (0.6239), M_Q (0.6070), eye contact (0.4743), CARS (-0.3148), Rec_Q (0.2984), P_Q (0.2629)의 순서로 나타났다. 결론: 발달지연이 있을 때 경험 있는 의사의 정기적인 추적 관찰은 매우 중요하며, 특히 1차 잠정진단이 GDD나 DLD 환자인 경우, 언어지연이 다른 영역에 비해 저명하면서(예; 자발어 없음) ASD의 예측 변수가 동반된 경우, ASD의 진단 기준에 합당하지 않더라도 최대한 일찍 집중적 조기 중재를 시작하는 것이 바람직하며, 장기적이고 주기적인 추적관찰이 필요하다.","Pupose: Early detection of developmental delay is important because early intervention can reduce the disabilities that may arise in the future, as well as reduce social burdens and costs. In this study, we reviewed the changes of the diagnosis of patients who were followed up more than 2 times in the patients who visited the NHIS Ilsan Hospital Developmental Delay Clinic. In the cases whose final diagnosis were autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), developmental language disorder (DLD), we performed this study to investigate the predictive factors of these diseases that can be discriminated in advance in order to provide appropriate early intervention.Methods: From August 2007 to July 2013, 168 patients who visited the NHIS Ilsan Hospital (total 733 patients) more than 2 times were included. All patients visited three departments (Pediatric Neurology, Rehabilitation & Psychiatry) at the same time according to a multidisciplinary approach. Speech evaluation, development & IQ test, social and emotional evaluation and hearing test were performed routinely. K-CARS, MRI, EEG, chromosome, and metabolic study were selected according to the patients. Review of medical records of children was performed retrospectively. Results: 1) The mean age of children at 1st and follow-up visit was 2.78 years (4-97 months) and 4.81 years (24-136 months) each. The mean follow-up period was 4.81 years (24-136 months). 2) The most common chief complaints of patients was language delay (71.5%). 3) The difference between the tentative diagnosis and the final diagnosis was mainly observed in the GDD and DLD patients. Eventually, the final diagnosis ID was diagnosed more in the GDD than in the DLD (65.3% vs 42.3%), but the diagnosis ASD was diagnosed similarly (16.3 vs 19.2%). 4) Long-term prognosis was better for patients with DLD who has higher nonverbal cognitive developmental quotient (C-DQ >70) at initial visit. 5) Result of the canonical coefficients by discrimination analysis showed that C-DQ (0.7436) was the strongest discriminating factor that predict the three groups, followed by SMS (0.6239), M_Q (0.6070), and eye Contact (0.4743), CARS (-0.3148), Rec_Q (0.2984), and P_Q (0.2629).Conclusion: Regular follow-up of experienced doctor is very important when a patient is delayed. If language delay is prominent compared to other areas & if discriminating factors of ASD are detected, it is advisable to initiate intensive early intervention with long-term periodic follow-up even if it does not meet the diagnostic criteria of ASD with long-term periodic follow-up."

Thus, this paper first aims to translate/interpret Genesis 2:5-6 more correctly through a terminological study on ś￮aḥ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; x;yfi) and 'ēśeḇ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; bf,[e) in verse 5 and 'ēḏ (dae) in verse 6, a close study on the text of Genesis 2:5-6 itself, and an inter-textual interpretation of the text done in association with other related texts. Further, most studies have provided little or no help in understanding the function of Genesis 2:5-6. Therefore, the second goal of this study is to perceive the function that Genesis 2:5-6 has in the broader context, as well as in its immediate context. Keeping these two goals in mind, we proceeded with this research from a synchronic/ literary perspective, paying close attention to the Hebrew text in the BHS (Biblia hebraica stuttgartensia).Taking Genesis 21:15 and Job 30:4, 7, where ś￮aḥ (x;yfi) occurs, into account, even though ś￮aḥ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; x;yfi) in Genesis 2:5 is used only once in the Old Testament, we identified the meaning of ś￮aḥ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; x;yfi) through the parallelisms in Genesis 2:5a and 3:18, and in Genesis 3:17bα-bβ, 18a, and 19aα. We identified the meaning of 'ēśeḇ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; bf,[e) in Genesis 2:5 in relation to Psalm 104:14, first taking into account its usage in Genesis 3:18, Exodus 9:22, 25[2x], and 10:15. Attention was then paid to the significant expression la'abōd 'et-hā'adāmāh (hm'd'a]h'-ta, dbo[]l;), where the Hebrew verb 'ābaḏ (db;[', ""till"") is first used (in Gen 2:5). It appears once more, in 3:23, these two verses being its only occurrences in the Old Testament. In addtion, we took notice of the parallelism which Genesis 3:18, where 'ēśeḇ haśśāḏeh (hd,F'h; bf,[e) occurs right after 2:5, forms with 3:17b, 19aα. The term 'ēḏ (dae) in Genesis 2:6 occurs once more (in Job 36:27) in the Old Testament, but its translation/interpretation there is nothing but a deduction from its context. Thus, the information for the exact translation/interpretation of 'ēḏ (dae) in Genesis 2:6 seemed to have to be obtained from the predicate which corresponds to 'ēḏ (dae), the subject ofGenesis2:6,andfromcomparativelinguistics. However,theexisting views, based on comparative linguistics, were proven to be unconvincing by Gerhard F. Hasel and Michael G. Hasel, and even the view that they newly highlighted and reinforced is not clearly persuasive. The reason is that they neither meticulously read Genesis 2:6 itself, nor carefully did inter-textual interpretation of it in association with other related texts. The Hebrew verb 'ālāh (hl'[', ""go up""), which is one of the two Hebrew verbs in the predicate of Genesis 2:6, is used for the going up of a well in Numbers 21:17, and the other Hebrew verb ﾚāqāh (hq'v' Hiphil: ""cause to drink water, give to drink"") is also used for the water supply of a spring in Joel 4:18[H 3:18]. A much more decisive fact is that, in the context corresponding to the third day of the Creation week in the so-called ""Creation epic"" (Ps 104), God's activity separating the dry land from the waters and the situation in which the separation is completely done is vividly portrayed in verses 9-10 (ESV): ""You [God] set a boundary that they [the waters] may not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth. You make springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills."" In regard to the text of Genesis 2:5-6 itself, verse 5a is differentiated by the conjunction k￮ (yKi) from verses 5b-6, but verse 6 is a clause which is dominated by the conjunction just as verse 5b is. And it is logically proper to regard the clause of Genesis 2:5b, which starts with the conjunction k￮ (yKi), not as a causal clause but as a tempora..."

Fabrication of Potassium Ion Source and its Emission Characteristics,2016,"['$K^+$ ion source', 'RGA', 'Filament type', 'LE IS']",,"In this study, we fabricated the $K^+$ ion source for the various purposes and investigated the emission characteristics. The fabricated $K^+$ ion source was painted in the tungsten filament to make filament type ion source. The RGA spectra show that the filament type $K^+$ ion source has a good out gassing character, so it can be used in the ultra-high vacuum system. The maximum $K^+$ ion current was 20 mA when filament temperature was 1410 K and filament potential was 50 V. When the filament temperature was 1070 K, the initial beam current was 50 mA and decreased only by 2% during 4 hours. The emitting energy was measured to be 2.04 eV. This low value means that the fabricated specimen is a good $K^+$ ion source. We conclude that this filament type ion source can be used in various fields, including the LEIS research."

Reliability and validity of the workplace harassment questionnaire for Korean finance and service workers,2016,"['Workplace harassment', 'Finance workers', 'Questionnaire development']",,"Background: Harassment means systemic and repeated unethical acts. Research on workplace harassment have been conducted widely and the NAQ-R has been widely used for the researches. But this tool, however the limitations in revealing differended in sub-factors depending on the culture and in reflecting that unique characteristics of the Koren society. So, The workplace harassment questionnaire for Korean finace and service workers has been developed to assess the level of personal harassment at work. This study aims to develop a tool to assess the level of personal harassment at work and to test its validity and reliability while examining specific characteristics of workplace harassment against finance and service workers in Korea.  Methods: The framework of survey was established based on literature review, focused-group interview for the Korean finance and service workers. To verify its reliability, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was calculated; and to verify its validity, items and factors of the tool were analyzed. The correlation matrix analysis was examined to verify the tool’s convergent validity and discriminant validity. Structural validity was verified by checking statistical significance in relation to the BDI-K.  Results: Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of this survey was 0.93, which indicates a quite high level of reliability. To verify the appropriateness of this survey tool, its construct validity was examined through factor analysis. As a result of the factor analysis, 3 factors were extracted, explaining 56.5 % of the total variance. The loading values and communalities of the 20 items were 0.85 to 0.48 and 0.71 to 0.46. The convergent validity and discriminant validity were analyzed and rate of item discriminant validity was 100 %. Finally, for the concurrent validity, We examined the relationship between the WHI-KFSW and pschosocial stress by examining the correlation with the BDI-K. The results of chi-square test and multiple logistic analysis indicated that the correlation with the BDI-K was satatisctically significant.  Conclusion: Workplace harassment in actual workplaces were investigated based on interviews, and the statistical analysis contributed to systematizing the types of actual workplace harassment.

In sufficient dimension reduction, the original predictors ${\mathbf{X}}$ are replaced by its lower-dimensional linear projection without loss of information on selected aspects of the conditional distribution. Depending on the aspects, the central subspace, the central mean subspace and the central $k^{th}$-moment subspace are defined and investigated as primary interests. Then the relationships among the three subspaces and the changes in the three subspaces for non-singular transformation of ${\mathbf{X}}$ are studied. We discuss the two conditions to guarantee the existence of the three subspaces that constrain the marginal distribution of ${\mathbf{X}}$ and the conditional distribution of $Y{\mid}{\mathbf{X}}$. A general approach to estimate them is also introduced along with an explanation for conditions commonly assumed in most sufficient dimension reduction methodologies."

Though these two concepts seem to be obviously uncompatible, the Ratnagotravibhāga tries to bridge these concepts. In order to investigate the relationship, I have focussed on three points: Firstly, as the prerequisite for understanding the meanings of Tathāgatagarbha in the Ratnagotravibhāga, it is necessary to realize that there are two aspects of Tathāgatagarbha: one relating with the causal level and the other with fruit-level. I discuss these two aspects with regard the three meaning of Tathāgatagarbha.Secondly, Ratnagotravibhāga deals with the description of the hindrances for three kinds of practitioners. theses hindrances, which were produced on the basis of the ignorance of the nature of the Tathāgatagarbha, is to be eliminated through the realization of the emptiness. It is highly interesting in this context that Ratnagotravibhāga uses very similar terms with the Yogācāra texts.Thirdly, the terminological similarity should be noticed, if we want to investigate the reason why Ratnagotravibhāga departs from the Yogācāra texts. For this purpose, I compare the explanation of the Ratnagotravibhāga with that of the Madhyāntavibhāga-Bhāṣya of Vasubandhu and the Madhyāntaṭīkā of Sthiramati. The points dealt with are: (1) the reason for the distinction of the emptiness in the state of samala and nirmala. (2) the meaning of the emptiness in the state of samala and nirmala. (3) the meaning of unchangeability of the emptiness.By comparing the Ratnagotravibhāga with the Yogācāra texts, I am intending to show the departing points of the Yogācāra interpretation from the Ratnagotravibhāga which represents the Tathāgatagarbha school in India."

The object of study is Chinese and Korean “頭” related Chinese and Korean “頭” idioms and other forms of expression are beyond the scope of this paper. “頭” related words are the most frequently used vocabulary in both Modern Chinese and Modern Korean. Meanwhile, “頭” occupies a very important position in the human and animal body and also associated with the life and death problem of a survival. Human beings rely on “頭” to think and then get known about the world. So, it is of great importance to take semantic research on human terms “頭” related words. Semantics is the result of taking the overall perception of things, is an empirical abstract mental map, it may involve taking a variety of features, some of which feature living in the foreground, which are prototypical; other features in background-position, which are marginal. Cognitive linguistics called ‘figure’ and ‘ground’. With combined theories of cognitive linguistics and comparative linguistics, this paper mainly analyzed Chinese and Korean “頭” related words in respective language system semantic evolution. And also, “structural justice” and “righteousness features” comparative analysis is given on this basis of two semantic aspects for Chinese and Korean “頭” related words. The “structural connection” is the location of the “頭” itself and the “頭” revealed on the human oranimal body, in other words, the combination of “appearance” and “location”.

In particular, the identification performance of the RBFN algorithm is being improved by optimizing parameters such as the center, width, and weight, and improved algorithms such as the radial basis function network-stochastic gradient (RBFN-SG) and radial basis function network-normalized stochastic gradient (RBFN-NSG) have been announced. In this study, we optimized the number of centers, which is one of the parameters of the RBFN-NSG algorithm, and observed the change in the identification performance. For the experiment, repeated measurement data of 8 samples were used, and the elbow method was applied to determine the optimal number of centers for each sample of input data. The experiment was carried out in two cases(the only one center per sample and the optimal number of centers obtained by elbow method), and the experimental results were compared using the mean square error (MSE). From the results of the experiments, we observed that the case having an optimal number of centers, obtained using the elbow method, showed a better identification performance than that without any optimization."

For that reason, financial regulatory authorities have built the strongest and the most severe chinese walls between both businesses for the purpose of protecting the interest of customers only, which could be rarely found in other financially advanced countries. Traditionally, other countries have emphasized on the importance of a principle in the financial sector and put the chinese walls generally under self regulations, so called ``principle-based regulations``, rather than under the mandatory statutes and regulations, so called ``rule-based regulations``. Surprisingly, Japan introduced the mandatory regime in regulating conducts of businesses when it enacted the Financial Products Transaction Act of 2006, and Korea followed a same direction in enacting the Capital Market Act. Two years later in 2008, however, Japan fundamentally changed its rule-based regulation system to a principle-based regulation system. This means that Korea is the only rule-based regulation country among financially advanced countries. This paper analyzes deeply the British self regulatory regime in the conduct of a financial business area which has been admired as the most idealistic principle-based regulation system in terms of chinese wall regulations by all over the world, which will be sure to suggest the future reform of the Capital Market Act in Korea. Originally, chinese wall regulations were designed to block the delivery of non-public material information. However, after the firm establishment of the mandatory insider regulation system, chinese wall regulations have focused on the importance of a self-ruling and internal control system. This paper concludes the fundamental reform of the Capital Market Act toward a principle-based regulation system."

However, current task distribution approaches do not consider the number of VM, which can be a critical factor in the decision making. This paper proposes a dynamic task distribution on clustered data centers. A proportional VM migration approach is also proposed, where it migrates virtual machines to the cloud servers proportionally according to their allocated CPU, in order to prevent overloading of resources in servers. Moreover, we included the resource capacity of each data center in terms of the maximum CPU in order to improve the migration approach in cloud servers. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism for task distribution greatly improves the overall performance of the system."

In 1980s, there are movements for trying to improve women s social and legal status such as English Laws and Cases. Consequently, women s social and legal status are elevated, but the child’s status in the law gets no better. I think it is because parents have thought them as their possessions. They say that their thought are influenced by the Confucianism. I can not go along with them. To be influenced by the Confucian culture means, I believe, that there is an order of rank based on respect and benevolence not a command and subordination between parents and children. There were days when children were possessions of their parents in U.K. For the materials are from the Blackstone’s work, the author called that time as ‘Blackstone’s age’. Furthermore, As maternal rights are liberated from the father’s, the child’s status grew strong together. And finally, the child’s status established by the Child Act 1989. In this paper, the author described parental rights, maternal rights and child’s rights in common law and equity. And interpreted several cases and finally examined the Gillick case. In this process the author reached the conclusion that we need to recognize the child’s status in law for preventing the child abuse. The living lesson of U.K. gives us many implications in preventing the child abuse."

Development and Comparison of Warfarin Dosing Algorithms in Stroke Patients,2016,"['CYP2C9', 'Korean', 'stroke', 'VKOC1', 'warfarin']",,"Purpose: The genes for cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) have been identified as important genetic determinants of warfarin dosing and have been studied. We developed warfarin algorithm for Korean patients with stroke and compared the accuracy of warfarin dose prediction algorithms based on the pharmacogenetics.Materials and Methods: A total of 101 patients on stable maintenance dose of warfarin were enrolled. Warfarin dosing algorithm was developed using multiple linear regression analysis. The performance of all the algorithms was characterized with coefficient of determination, determined by linear regression, and the mean of percent deviation was used to predict doses from the actual dose. In addition, we compared the performance of the algorithms using percentage of predicted dose falling within ±20% of clinicallyobserved doses and dividing the patients into a low-dose group (≤3 mg/day), an intermediate-dose group (3–7 mg/day), and high-dose group (≥7 mg/day).Results: A new developed algorithms including the variables of age, body weight, and CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype. Our algorithmaccounted for 51% of variation in the warfarin stable dose, and performed best in predicting dose within 20% of actual dose and intermediate-dose group.Conclusion: Our warfarin dosing algorithm may be useful for Korean patients with stroke. Further studies to elucidate clinical utilityof genotype-guided dosing and find the additional genetic association are necessary."

In general reporting rate of internal accounting vulnerability reporting by listed company is lower than that of unlisted company. but reporting rate of internal accounting vulnerability reporting diminished as rating. Therefore. for listed company, when important internal accounting control system vulnerability is disclosed in business report. it affects stock prices. which means companies which have high credit ratings have good internal control system in prior. For unlisted company. the possibility of vulnerable reporting of internal control is relatively high because when they report internal accounting vulnerability it doesn t affect stock price.

Comparative Evaluation of Three Homogenization Methods for Isolating Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Nucleic Acids From Sputum Samples for Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR,2016,"['MERS coronavirus', 'Sputum', 'Homogenization', 'Nucleic acid extraction', 'Comparison', 'Proteinase K', 'DNase']",,"Background: Real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) of sputum samples is commonly used to diagnose Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Owing to the difficulty of extracting RNA from sputum containing mucus, sputum homogenization is desirable prior to nucleic acid isolation. We determined optimal homogenization methods for isolating viral nucleic acids from sputum.Methods: We evaluated the following three sputum-homogenization methods: proteinase K and DNase I (PK-DNase) treatment, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine and sodium citrate (NALC) treatment. Sputum samples were spiked with inactivated MERS-CoV culture isolates. RNA was extracted from pretreated, spiked samples using the easyMAG system (bioMérieux, France). Extracted RNAs were then subjected to rRT-PCR for MERS-CoV diagnosis (DiaPlex Q MERS-coronavirus, SolGent, Korea).Results: While analyzing 15 spiked sputum samples prepared in technical duplicate, false-negative results were obtained with five (16.7%) and four samples (13.3%), respectively, by using the PBS and NALC methods. The range of threshold cycle (Ct) values observed when detecting upE in sputum samples was 31.1-35.4 with the PK-DNase method, 34.7-39.0 with the PBS method, and 33.9-38.6 with the NALC method. Compared with the control, which were prepared by adding a one-tenth volume of 1:1,000 diluted viral culture to PBS solution, the ranges of Ct values obtained by the PBS and NALC methods differed significantly from the mean control Ct of 33.2 (both P<0.0001).Conclusions: The PK-DNase method is suitable for homogenizing sputum samples prior to RNA extraction."
Surface Modification of Polyester Fibers by Thermal Reduction with Silver Carbamate Complexes,2016,"['Thermal reduction', 'Polyester fiber', 'Silver carbamate complex', 'Nanoparticles']",,"In this study, the surface of polyester fiber was modified by means of thermal treatment with a silver carbamate complex. We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM), an X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to allow a detailed characterization of the silver-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers. The results revealed remarkable changes in the surface morphology and microstructure of the silver film after thermal reduction. On SEM, the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were seen to be uniformly and densely deposited on the fiber surface. The XRD pattern of the silver-coated fiber indicated that the film has a crystalline structure. A continuous layer of AgNPs, between 30 and 100 nm in size, was assembled on the PET fibers. The PET/Ag composite was found to impart high conductivity to the fibers, with an electrical resistivity as low as <TEX>$0.12k{\Omega}{\cdot}cm$</TEX>."

The results showed that the Vickers hardness was raise up to 630 HV from 565 HV. As shown in XRD results, the amorphous alloys changed to nanocrystals, which were $Cu_8Zr_3$, $Cu_3Ti_2$ and CuZr, improved the hardness. The SEM analysis showed that the compression fractured morphology of amorphous alloys was brittle fracture, and the fracture morphology after annealing was ductile fracture. This proved that annealing of amorphous to nanocrystals can improve the plasticity and toughness of amorphous alloys."
Opportunistic Function Computation for Wireless Sensor Networks,2016,"['wireless sensor networks', 'In-network computation', 'fading channels', 'lattice codes', 'opportunistic communication', 'power adaptation']",,"<P>Function computation over wireless sensor networks is investigated, where a set of K sensors observe their sensor readings and a fusion center wishes to learn a predefined function of the sensor readings via fading multiple access channels (MACs). In this paper, the arithmetic sum and type functions are considered since they can yield various fundamental sample statistics such as mean, variance, maximum, and minimum. We propose a novel opportunistic in-network computation (INC) framework in which a subset of sensors with large channel gains opportunistically participate in the transmission at each time, while all sensors simultaneously send their observations or only a single sensor sends its observation in the conventional schemes. We mathematically analyze the long-term average computation rate of the proposed INC, and prove that it achieves a nonvanishing computation rate even when the number of sensors K tends to infinity, which is in fact a significant improvement and the first theoretical result in fading MACs. Note that the computation rates of the conventional schemes become zero as K increases. We further show that a similar multiuser diversity gain is still achievable under delay constraints, which implies that the proposed INC is restricted to exploit a fixed and finite number of time slots (or fading instances) for the function computation.</P>"

This study focused on the analysis of 32 regions on its characteristics of local climate change adaptation plans. First, statistic program R was used for conducting cluster analysis based on the frequency and budgets of adaptation plan. Further, we analyzed damage frequency from newspapers regarding climate change impacts in eight categories which were caused by extreme weather events on 2,565 cases for 24 years. Lastly, the characteristics of climate change adaptation plan was compared with damage frequency patterns for evaluating the adequacy of climate change adaptation plan on each cluster.Four different clusters were created by cluster analysis. Most clusters clearly have their own characteristics on certain sectors. There was a high frequency of damage in ‘disaster’ and ‘health’ sectors. Climate change adaptation plan and budget also invested a lot on those sectors. However, when comparing the relative rate among regional governments, there was a difference between types of damage and climate change adaptation plan. We assumed that the difference could come from that each region established their adaptation plans based on not only the frequency of damage, but vulnerability assessment, and expert opinions as well. The result of study could contribute to policy making of climate change adaptation plan."

[약속]을 의미하는 종결어미 구조체 ‘-ㅁ자’는 [약속]의 ‘-ㅁ-’에 [화자의 바람]을 뜻하는 ‘-자’가 결합한 것으로 추정하였다. 끝으로 「저무는 황혼」의 독특한 통사 구조를 국어학적 관점에서 분석하고, 정확한 독법을 제시하였다.","This paper explores from the viewpoint of Korean linguistics some special poetic terms and syntactic structures shown in Midang Seo Jeong-ju's poetry. As objects of this study, The terms are ‘ohirjə(오히려)’, ‘mahurɛgi dance(마후래기 춤)’, ‘tsane(자네)’, ‘k’ɨrida(끄리다)’, and ‘s’ɨida(쓰이다)’, and in the syntactic structures there are the genitive particle ‘e(에)’, the conjunctive-ending element ‘-mdza(-ㅁ자)’, and unique coherent structures.In Midang's poem, “Seonunsa Temple Valley Entrance(선운사 동구)”, ‘ohirjə(오히려)’ is often replaced by other poetic words such as ‘adzikto(아직도)’, ‘sibangdo(시방도)’, and ‘saɧgido(상기도)’. This has embarrassed many Korean literary researchers, but in fact, ‘ohirjə(오히려)’ used in Midang's poetry is a synonym for ‘adzikto(아직도)’. This fact can be distinctively confirmed in not only many historical data of Korean language but also Midang's other works(poetry & prose). For ‘mahurɛgi dance(마후래기 춤)’, it is reasonable to assume that the dance refers to a hat dance or a head shaking dance, diverging from ‘tshəjong dance(처용무)’. The third person pronoun ‘tsane(자네)’ is often found as an honorific expression in his poems. And this can be accessed to used as fairly conservative usage in aspect of the history of Korean. In addition, while ‘k’ɨrida(끄리다)’, the advanced verb form of ‘pskɨrida(리다)’, is seen to mean [bear], ‘s’ɨida(쓰이다)’ is [persist].In Midang's poetry, the specific genitive particle ‘e(에)’ is frequently used in the place of common genitive particle ‘ɨj(의)’. The particle ‘e’(에) seems to derive from locative particles ‘et/ɛt(엣/앳)’ of Middle Korean or‎Modern Korean. In this respect, this paper suggests an appropriate method for interpreting ‘tshoronge bulpit(초롱에 불빛)’ which is one of most controversial poetic terms in Midang’s famous poem “Kwitshokto(귀촉도)”. The conjunctive-ending element ‘-mdza(-ㅁ자)’, having the meaning of [appointment], is thought as a combination of ‘-m-(-ㅁ-)’ and ‘-dza(-자)’ which refers to [speaker's desire]. Finally, as unique syntactic structures of “Getting dark twilight(저무는 황혼)” are analysed from the aspect of Korean linguistics, the accurate interpretive method is suggested."
Tunable thermoelectric transport properties of Cu0.008Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 via control of the spark plasma sintering conditions,2016,,,"<P>Polycrystalline bulks of n-type Cu0.008Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 were prepared to investigate the controllability of its thermoelectric transport properties by using the compaction conditions of spark plasma sintering (SPS). The 00l crystal orientation to the press direction of the SPSed bulks was easily improved by increasing the applied pressure at 500 A degrees C. The thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT values (0.72 - 0.75 at 300 K), of all samples were almost the same, however, both the electronic and the thermal transport properties could be tuned significantly by adjusting the sintering pressure. This result highlights the feasibility of using pressure-induced sintering as a fabrication technology for Bi2Te3-based polycrystalline bulks with high mechanical reliability, which is an effective means of optimizing the electrical and the thermal conductivities for maximizing the efficiencies of the thermoelectric cooling and the power generation modules.</P>"

When the data from Contemporary Korean dialects and the sixteenth-century written documents is carefully examined, however, the cause and mechanism of the phenomenon can be interpreted in a different way. The restoration is not sufficiently explained by the single cause, i.e. elimination of allomorphs, which applies only to connective endings, such as -kwo and -key, since the reintroduction of /k/ in comitative particle -kwa has to be understood as an unification of its alternating condition with that of other case and auxiliary particles. The mechanism of the change is basically analogy, but a possibility of dialect borrowing needs to be taken into account as well. The high percentage of /k/ occurrence in its lenition environments in the sixteenth-century local publications does not mean that the phoneme has actually returned, but that the original /k/ just still remains in those dialects. This fact implies that at least some of the /k/-restored forms even in the publications by central government are the result of borrowing from other dialects."

One of the methods which has been endorsed by such countries is the fit-and-proper test of the controlling shareholder and the management members who are actually controlling the companies. For this purpose, the U.S. enacted the Federal level regulation, such as The Dodd-Frank Act, and the U.K. reorganized its financial regulatory system focusing on the FCA and PRA. Both countries, commonly, strengthened the fit-and-proper test for the controlling shareholder and the management members.Under the Korean regulatory scheme, the test has been already adopted at the Bank company and Bank holding company. However, other financial institutions, such as Insurance company, Securities company and Credit Card company has been free from the fit-and-proper test for their controlling shareholder. On July, 2015, the Korean Assembly enacted the Act of the Financial Company’s Corporate Governance which expanded the fit-and-proper test for the controlling shareholder to the Insurance, Securities and Credit Card companies.From this perspectives, I analyzes the U.S. and U.K. regulatory scheme of the fit-and-proper test at Chapter II, along with the Joint Forum’s recommendation.  Chapter III explains current regulatory scheme of each regulation for Korean Financial Institutions and points out some deficiencies. Finally, I recommends certain means which would prevent future abuses by controlling shareholder’s power."
Basal area effects on a short-term nutrient status of litter fall and needle litter decomposition in a Pinus densiflora stand,2016,"['carbon', 'litter decomposition', 'needle litter', 'nutrient cycling', 'Pinus densiflora']",,"This study was conducted to examine litter fall, litter decomposition, and a short-term nutrient (C, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) status for one year at various levels of basal area (21.4, 27.0, 30.8, 37.0, 42.1, and 46.7 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>) in approximately 40-yearold red pine (Pinus densiflora S. et Z.) stands in the Hwangmaesan mountain forest in Korea. Monthly fluxes of litter fall components such as needles, broad leaves, branches, bark and total litter fall followed a similar pattern at various levels of basal area. Mean annual needle, bark and total litter fall fluxes were positively correlated with increased basal area (p<0.05), but the woody litter such as branches and cones was not correlated with basal area. Carbon and K concentrations of needle litter were negatively correlated with increased basal area, while nutrient (C, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) fluxes were positively correlated with the basal area treatments. Remaining mass, N and P concentration and remaining N and P stocks in decomposing needle litter were not affected by the basal area. However, the concentration and stocks remaining of K, Ca, and Mg from decomposing litter were positively correlated with increased basal area during the initial three months of decomposition. The results indicate that basal area has an impact on nutrient cycles through change in litter fall and litter decomposition processes; thus, the dynamics of nutrient cycles based on a stand scale could differ considerably with different levels of basal area in red pine stands."

Fandom studies usually focus on “K-Pop Idol” fandom, because idol fandom is well known, big-sized and well-organized, and it holds a large consumer market in the culture industries. However, the fandom of Korean youth cannot be confined to idol fandom. The areas of interest of fans are various, including comics, movies, indie music, novels, history (and historical dramas), sports, internet games, and more. As the informants of this study grew up alongside the development of the internet and information media, and they are used to popular culture and its fandom. We can say that fandom is their conventional activity. There are some characteristics in Korean youth fandom. Although cultural details are different from one genre to another, consuming “cultural goods” is very important in the fan`s world. Cultural goods in fandom includes more than only the official products like music CDs, T-shirts or listening to music repeatedly via internet streaming service, but also secondary products produced by fan themselves which include fan-fic (fan fiction), illustrations, photos taken by themselves, key-rings, self-made figures, and more. To consume these goods means to show one`s own identity as a fan, and they think they can have true membership through consuming the goods. To get some information about their favorites and to communicate with each other, fans are using various media platforms. One of the most useful communicating platforms is Twitter. Fandom means some kind of taste. However, sometimes some fans try to hide their own taste for fandom. For example, idol fandom is treated as vulgar or shallow-brained. In addition, some women who are fans of sports like baseball, football and e-sports are viewed as if they are merely looking for handsome guys. Another such case is that it is not considered appropriate in Korea to prefer Japanese animations or comics. Hence, there is a“hierarchy of taste.” In this hierarchy, some fans who do not want to be evaluated through their own taste try to conceal the fact that they are fans of a specific genre."

The urban heat island intensity (UHII) is the actual temperature difference between the urban area and the rural area. The reason for the UHII can be explained in part by the buildings, how they absorb short wave solar irradiance during the day and reradiate long wave radiation especially at night on clear cloud-free nights. The UHII in Ulsan and Deajeon is significant so it should be taken into account in the design especially for warm summer nights when the city centre temperature could be up to 8K higher than the rural area. The UHII is not so significant in the daytime as at night, contrary to the common conception that it occurs during the day. At present the weather data currently used by designers is invariably derived from meteorological measurements taken at semi-rural sites often at airfields, away from urban center. This paper looks at the trend of temperature and urban heat island intensity by analyzing and estimation. The proposed model can provide the typical weather data for estimation of building energy using the measured data from Ulsan and Daejeon, South Korea."

The study focuse on the rituals performed by Lee after his mother's death, his participation in the funeral, and his mourning specifically as an individual who has lost his parent. Reviewing Lee’s mourning life beside the grave, the contents of diary belonging to a nobleman in the middle of Joseon Dynasty were studied aimsing to find out the meaning of rituals, the overall recognition accorded to death, and the filial duties that were carried out by the noblemen of the time.Although noblemen in the middle of Joseon Dynasty ceaselessly attempted to change the observance of funeral rituals through legislation, it was difficult to change the mindset of the people, who fllowed the deep-rooted traditions of long history. It must be acknowledged that the Joseon Dynasty had a different cultural background than that of China. There was a fundamental problem when they tried to adapt The Family Rituals of Zhu Xi, followed by the Chinese, to the Joseon society. Although The Family Rituals of Zhu Xi emphasized ancestral rites focusing on enshrining mortuary tablets and the importance of establishing the family shrine hundred times, noblemen in the mid-Joseon Dynasty period cared for their parents in the grave by mourning for them than by following such practice. The solemn memorial service held in front of the grave, and the annual ritual service on the death anniversary were far more important to the noblemen in the mid-Joseon Dynasty. Amid such contradictions, the noblemen accepted and performed the mourning rituals beside the grave of their parent.Human beings across the ages have always dwelt upon thoughts of the afterlife. Most people believe that they attain a state after the death of their physicalbody. If humans did not have such thoughts, they would not be bothered if death occurs on being hit by a car on the street. Thus, human beings often think of the ritual services related to death, although in different forms. Therefore, mourning by the grave of their parent held great significance among the noblemen of the Joseon Dynasty as a sign of their filial piety."

Originally, the name of the castle had been written as Tanghang Castle(Tanghang sŏng ; 唐項城). in Chinese characters, meaning a “castle on the road to Tang.” Silla organized Namyang region into Tangsŏng county(唐城郡), with Tanghang Castle as the capital city of the county. The name of the county, Tangsŏng(唐城), came from the Tanghang Castle, omitting the word “hang(項)” from Tanghang Castle(唐項城).Later, Silla changed Chinese characters of the name from Tanghang sŏng(唐項城) to Tanghang sŏng(党項城) in the second year of King Sŏndŏk(善德王). The new Chinese characters for the castle, Tanghang(党項), referred to Tangut(党項), an ethnic group in the west frontier of the Tang Dynasty. Silla’s intention to change the name was to congratulate the Emperor of Tang on Tangut’s submission to his rule. It was a desperate diplomatic measure of King Sŏndŏk, who was embroiled in controversy about her legitimacy of succession because of her gender; the king attempted to conciliate Emperor Taizong(太宗), who had boycotted installation of King Sŏndŏk, and ultimately pacify the opposition in the political sphere of Silla.During the period of the unification war in the 7th century, Tanghang Castle consistently played a critical role as a gateway to the Tang Dynasty from Silla. Yet after the end of the war, Silla reorganized the system of regional governments on a nationwide scale during the reign of King Sinmun(神文王). In this process, the capital city of Tangsŏng county transferred to flatland, and evidently Tanghang Castle lost its status as a capital city, and role as a gateway to the Tang Dynasty."
여성 관리자의 일자리 이동이 임금 및 직장만족도에 미치는 영향,2016,"['여성 관리자', '일자리 이동', '직장만족도', 'Women managers', 'Job turnover', 'Job satisfaction10']","본 연구는 일자리 이동 유형에 미치는 요인과 일자리 이동이 개인의 임금과 직장만족도에 미치는 영향을 분석하였다. 일자리 이동에 따라 동일 업무를 유지하는 경우에는, 이전 직장에서 형성된 직장 경험이 현재 직장에서 유효하지만, 업무의 내용이 일치하지 않을 경우에는 인적자본의 연속성이 사라진다고 가정하였다. 분석을 위해서 여성관리자패널 1차년도 자료가 사용되었다. 동일 업무 이동에 대한 프로빗 분석 결과에 따르면, 여성 관리자의 경우에는 이전 직장에서의 근속년수가 통계적으로 유의하지 않았다. 이는 여성 관리자의 경우에는 이전 직장에서의 근무경험이 현 직장에서의 업무에 별다른 역할을 하지 못한다는 의미로 해석된다. 반면 결혼 및 자녀유무는 동일업무로의 이직확률을 낮추는 것으로 분석되었다. 다음으로 동일 업무 유지 여부에 따른 임금변화 분석결과에 따르면, 여성 관리자의 경우 동일 업무를 유지할 경우 그렇지 않은 여성보다 약 12% 임금수준이 높았다. 반면, 직장만족도에는 0.3점정도 낮았다. 본 연구는 여성관리자의 경우에는 직장생활을 통한 인적자본 형성이 제한적으로 이루어지고 있으며, 같은 업무가 유지되더라도 직장환경이 여성에 우호적이지 않을 수 있음을 보였다. 따라서 여성고용정책은 직장유지를 통한 전문성 확보와 더불어 여성 친화적 직장문화 조성도 고려해야 할 것이다.","The purpose of this study is to examine the determinants of job turnover type and the effects of job turnover of women managers on wage and job satisfaction using the first wave of Korean Women Manager Panel data in Korea. According to the empirical results of probit analysis, the coefficients of female managers are not statistically significant of the continued working hours in the previous job. It means that job experience of previous employments is not working for female managers at their current job. On the other hand, the possibility of job turnover with the similar job continuity depends on marital status and with or without children. This possibility is lower when they are married and with children. Next, the estimations of earnings depending on the similar job continuity show that female managers who keep the similar job continuity have about 12 percent higher earnings than female managers who don’t keep it. However, the job satisfaction of female managers who keep the similar job continuity is 0.3 point lower than female managers who don’t keep it. This study shows that the composition of human capital in terms of job experience for the female managers is restricted. Their workplace environment may not be friendly to the female managers although the job continuity keeps. Therefore, the female employment policy needs to be considered that it should be creating a family friendly workplace with the job continuity."

Later, it is likely that Buddhist temples were established at ritual sites for Five Sacred Mountains during the reign of King Pŏp(法王) It is also possible that there was a connection to the fact that Emperor Wen(文帝) of Sui(隋) send his royal rescript to order to build temples in each of Chinese Five Sacred mountains at the same time.

Hyehyŏn were Buddhist monks who emphasized on the ideas of the Lotus Sutra(法華思想), which were strongly related to social integration, the ruling ideology of the central government could easily spread out to rural areas with expanding Buddhism.   The state rituals for Heaven in the capital of Baekje, and rituals for Five Emperors in rural areas were held in the month of the season. As the rituals for Five Sacred Mountains were possibly held in the same time, the rituals of the capital, its outskirts, and rural areas were progressed with a connection.

In this study, we examine the separation of ownership and control in the United Kingdom through Berle and Means (1932)’s perspective. First, we review the recent literature on U.K. corporations and demonstrate that most studies have neglected the mechanism of the control leverage. Second, by considering voting rules and flotation methods, we suggest a new interpretation of the process of share ownership diffusion.

This study analyzed specific cases. We selected 100 designs for Re-Birth from 11 brands of “K” fashion company in Korea, to be successfully sold in 2014. These cases are used in the analysis and are categorized into design types. As a result of the analysis, “Re-Birth Design” had five levels: Level 1. Changes in supplementary materials such as adding or removing decoration, Level 2. Changes in patterns or materials (changes within the product), Level 3. Partial changes in design (leading to a new design), Level 4. Complete deconstruction and rebirth of the design, and Level 5. Complete deconstruction followed by the use of the design source for a new product that is not a garment. This study analyzed products owned by brands, as well as successful cases of Re-Birth designs that reused existing resources, reduced energy consumption, and increased environmental and economic efficiency by recreating new products that could be resold."

Large-sample tests to determine the structural dimensions of the three target subspaces are well derived in most of the methodologies; however, a permutation test (which does not require large-sample distributions) is introduced. The test can be applied to the methodologies discussed in the paper. Theoretical relationships among the sufficient dimension reduction methodologies are also investigated and real data analysis is presented for illustration purposes. A seeded dimension reduction approach is then introduced for the methodologies to apply to large p small n regressions."

The results are as follows: Cardiovascular parameters by large area lighting (light wall) were all included in the standard range. VLF (Very Low Frequency) was stable when the HRV was higher than that of targets. The HRV was higher under eyes-closed condition than under eyes-open condition. With regard to body temperature control, vasomotion and hormone, a direct light projection method was stable under eyes-closed condition. LF (Low Frequency) was stable when the HRV was lower than that of targets. The HRV was lower under eyes-closed condition than under eyes-open condition. With regard to stress and supply of biological energy, a direct light projection method was stable under eyes-closed condition. In the case of HF (High Frequency), it was performed in a reversible state with regards to variations in respiratory cycle and heart rate variations. However, it was reduced and increased during eyes-open or eyes-closed conditions, respectively. Thus, the light stimulation by visual characteristics may be a factor affecting physiology. When lighting is given for the purpose of stress relief and stability, the lighting is more effective in non-visual environment. However, because the physiological efficacy is not limited in the Heart Rate Variability (HRV), it should be analyzed by various means such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) or electromyography (EMG)."

Thus, means of processing are required to convert the underutilized yellowfin tuna roes (YTR) into more marketable and acceptable forms as protein concentrate. Roe protein concentrates (RPCs) were prepared by cooking condition (boil-dried concentrate, BDC and steam-dried concentrate, SDC, respectively) and un-cooking condition (freeze-dried concentrate, FDC) from yellowfin tuna roe. The yield of RPCs was in the range from 22.2 to 25.3 g/100 g of roe. RPCs contained protein (72.3–77.3 %), moisture (4.3–5.6 %), lipid (10.6–11.3 %) and ash (4.3–5.7 %) as the major constituents. The prominent amino acids of RPCs were aspartic acid, 8.7–9.2, glutamic acid, 13.1–13.2, and leucine, 8.5–8.6 g/100 g of protein. Major differences were not observed in each of the amino acid. K, S, Na, and P as minerals were the major elements in RPCs. No difference noted in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein band (15–100 K) possibly representing partial hydrolysis of myosin. Therefore, RPCs from YTR could be use potential protein ingredient for human food and animal feeds."
High Temperature Deformation Behavior of Spray-Formed and Subsequently Extruded Al-25Si Based alloy,2016,"['alloys', 'deformation', 'compression test', 'recrystallization', 'transmission electron microscopy (TEM)']",,"The high temperature deformation behavior of spray-formed and subsequently extruded Al-25Si based alloy containing fine Si and ultra-fine intermetallic phases was examined by compressive tests at temperatures between 523 and 743 K and strain rates between 1.0 × 10 -3 and 1.0 × 10 0 /s. The true stress-true strain curves obtained from the compressive tests revealed a peak stress at the initial stage of deformation. The peak stress decreased with increasing temperature or decreasing strain rate. A close relationship was observed between the peak stress and the constitutive equation for high temperature deformation. In the deformed specimens, fine equiaxed grains were observed with a mean grain size of 330~590 nm, which was much finer than that measured prior to deformation (1.4 μm). A dislocation structure within the grains was also observed in the deformed specimens, indicating the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization during high temperature deformation of the present alloy. The occurrence of dynamic recrystallization was also supported by the existence of a peak stress in the flow curve."

Originally, the name of the castle hadbeen written as Tanghang Castle(Tanghang sŏng ; 唐項城). in Chinese characters, meaning a “castleon the road to Tang.” Silla organized Namyang region into Tangsŏng county(唐城郡), with TanghangCastle as the capital city of the county. The name of the county, Tangsŏng(唐城), came from theTanghang Castle, omitting the word “hang(項)” from Tanghang Castle(唐項城).Later, Silla changed Chinese characters of the name from Tanghang sŏng(唐項城) to Tanghangsŏng(党項城) in the second year of King Sŏndŏk(善德王). The new Chinese characters for the castle,Tanghang(党項), referred to Tangut(党項), an ethnic group in the west frontier of the Tang Dynasty.Silla’s intention to change the name was to congratulate the Emperor of Tang on Tangut’s submissionto his rule. It was a desperate diplomatic measure of King Sŏndŏk, who was embroiled in controversyabout her legitimacy of succession because of her gender; the king attempted to conciliate EmperorTaizong(太宗), who had boycotted installation of King Sŏndŏk, and ultimately pacify the oppositionin the political sphere of Silla.During the period of the unification war in the 7th century, Tanghang Castle consistently playeda critical role as a gateway to the Tang Dynasty from Silla. Yet after the end of the war, Silla reorganizedthe system of regional governments on a nationwide scale during the reign of King Sinmun(神文王).In this process, the capital city of Tangsŏng county transferred to flatland, and evidently TanghangCastle lost its status as a capital city, and role as a gateway to the Tang Dynasty."

Along with the meditation, as a means of acceptance, ACT  (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) was practiced together because of its strong relation to  Mindfulness realizing and observing every experience and stimulation. Therefore, each phase of the training  included Mindfulness practices such as realization and figurative speech through meditation, breathing, and  recording journal. As a result, the players tended to control difficulties at the preparation phase. At the  navigation phase, the training helped them accept themselves and find a new goal after analyzing goals under the  trans-valuation perspective. At the discernment phase, the negative emotion toward performance  scored 8.9 on average, and the degree of distraction reached 5.6. Therefore, it is proved that controlling over  emotionaffects negatively on performance. The implementation phase aimed at defusion with observing actions  that were subject to change during training and matches for value orientation. Finally, at the final phase, the  analysis on pre and post questionnaires for mental strength indicated significant improvement on  Mindfulness awareness, Attention, and Focus on present. However, the focus on present was lowered. After the  study, training stress was lowered in every factor. Limit on personal time was meaningfully lowered.

The length of pipo, embedded in the P3 cistron, was 231 nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Iranian isolates clustered with European recombinant NTN isolates in the N lineage. Recombination analysis demonstrated that Iranian $PVY^N$ isolates had a typical European $PVY^{NTN}$ genome having three recombinant junctions while $PVY^N$ and $PVY^O$ were identified as the parents. We used dN/dS methods to detect candidate amino acid positions for positive selection in viral proteins. The mean ${\omega}$ ratio differed among different genes. Using model M0, ${\omega}$ values were 0.267 (P1), 0.085 (HC-Pro), 0.153 (P3), 0.050 (CI), 0.078 (VPg), 0.087 (NIa-pro), 0.079 (NIb) and 0.165 (CP). The analysis showed different sites within P1, P3 and CP were under positive selection pressure, however, the sites varied among PVY populations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the first demonstration of population structure of $PVY^N$ strain in mid-Eurasia Iran using complete genome sequences and highlights the importance of recombination and selection pressure in the evolution of PVY."

The bases of value-added tax include the receipt of pecuniary and non-pecuniary payments, but not discounts. Under the points system, which is used as a means to facilitate transactions for suppliers, customers are allotted points corresponding to a set rate of the purchase amount whenever they engage in a primary transaction to purchase goods and services, which is redeemable for discounts in a secondary transaction with the same supplier based on their accumulated points. Although not at issue in this case, the Court first determined that, in a points system involving a single supplier, only the money actually received from its customers in secondary transactions is included in tax base, to the exclusion of that part of the account settled by points, which constitutes a discount. This seems to be in accord with tax practices in Japan and the U.K. Meanwhile, there are cases in which multiple suppliers are pooled into a points system and customers are allowed to redeem the accumulated points at any store of those suppliers subscribed to the points system. The question presented in this case involves such a circumstance, where the suppliers settle accounts based on the points redeemed in secondary transactions. The Court held that in such a case as well, only the money actually received from the customer in secondary transactions is included in tax base, while the account settled by points constitutes a discount.The significance of the case is that, in determining the nature of reward points widely adopted in general consumption practices and their treatment under the Value-Added Tax Act, the Court explained in detail the legal doctrine on discounts, one of the most controversial issues involving the scope of tax base under the Value-Added Tax Act, while reaffirming the meaning of the no taxation without representation principle under the Constitution, by applying a limited interpretation to the enforcement decree provision, of which the mandatory basis in the mother-law is vague at best."

Foliar application of fermented soybean extracts was applied at 6 times as a pre-experiment in the open-field in 2013, with a rain-shelter system in 2014. Fermented soybean extract treatment increased foliar concentrations of approximately 0.46% T-N, 0.17% K, 0.19% Ca, and 0.06% Mg in 2013 compared to the control, with similar macro-nutrients between the control and soybean extract treatment observed in 2014. Rain-shelter system increased foliar concentrations of T-N, Ca, and Mg compared to the open-field. There were no significantly different between the control and soybean extract treatment for number of leaves per fruit, leaf dry weight, phytotoxicity, and completed shoot growth on August during the two years. Rain-shelter system increased leaf dry weight and did not affect phytotoxicity in the leaves. Fruit quality parameters were mostly similar to control and soybean extract treatment for two years, with higher fruit firmness observed for soybean extract treatment. Rain-shelter system advanced 4 days of harvest dates, and increased approximately 7.0 ton fruit yield per ha, 20 g mean fruit weight, and fruit soluble solid contents compared to open-field in 2014. Soybean extract treatment little suppressed occurrence of disease and insect on the leaves and fruits in both years. Rain-shelter system increased occurrence of Venturia nashicola on the leaves and to 63.8% of Gymnosporangium asiaticum on the fruits in 2014. Strong winds and storms in May elevated relative humidity in the rain-shelter system and caused high infection of the disease occurrence, requiring for an additional green control method. Soybean extract treatment little affected tree growth and would have initiated for a long-term study to evaluate tree physiological characteristics. Rain-shelter system improved fruit productivity and advanced harvest dates, which could have been more effective facility at a Thanks Giving Day between middle and end of September."

In this work efforts have been made to slow the oxidation process of the graphite with a thin SiC coating (~10μm). Upon heating at≥1173K in air, the spallations and cracks were formed in the dense columnar structured SiC coating layer grown on the graphite with a functionally gradient electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD. In accordance with the formations of these defects, the sample was vigorously oxidized, leaving only the SiC coating layer. Then, efforts were made to heal the surface defects using additional EB-PVD with ion beam bombardment and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The EB-PVD did not effectively heal the cracks. But, the CVD was more appropriate for crack healing, likely due to its excellent crack line filling capability with a high density and high aspect ratio. It took~34min for the 20% weight loss of the CVD crack healed sample in the oxidation test with annealing at 1173K, while it took~8min for the EB-PVD coated sample, which means it took ~4 times longer at 1173K for the same weight reduction in this experimental set-up."

Exchangeable (Exch.) potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) were 0.39, 4.8 and $0.9cmolc\;kg^{-1}$, respectively, and Avail. $SiO_2$ was $170mg\;kg^{-1}$. In the long-term analysis, the contents of Avail. $SiO_2$, Exch. K and pH of paddy soils showed increasing tendency. However, Avail. $P_2O_5$, Exch.

The surface chemical properties of soil samples were investigated every 4 year from 2000 year at upland, 2001 year at orchard, and 2002 year at plastic film house. During 12 year's monitoring, mean soil pH was increased by 0.7 and 0.8 pH unit from pH 5.7 in upland and orchard, respectively, 0.5 pH unit from pH 6.5 in plastic film house. About 50% of all the field samples occupied within the recommended pH range (pH 6-7). Although soil organic matter (SOM) was gradually increased by about $10g\;kg^{-1}$ for 12 years, 40% of orchard, 49% of plastic film house, and 77% of upland soil samples were still below the 3% SOM. The mean concentration of available phosphate for 12 years in upland, orchard, and plastic film house were 530, 600, and $760mg\;kg^{-1}$, respectively. The relative frequencies exceeding the recommended available phosphate range ($300-550mg\;kg^{-1}$) were 43%, 53%, and 66% at upland, orchard, and plastic film house soils, respectively. $NH_4OAc$ exchangeable $K^+$ of upland, orchard, and plastic film house in the last soil test were 0.8, 0.9, and $1.6cmol_c\;kg^{-1}$, respectively. The relative frequencies above the recommended K level were 56% and 70% of orchard and plastic film house soil samples, respectively. The levels of crop nutrients except exchangeable Ca and Mg in upland soil were tended to increase gradually in the three fields. Exchangeable Mg, EC, available phosphate, organic matter and soil pH could be used as principle components to differentiate the chemical properties of three land fields. This analysis revealed that the soil fertility was affected by cropping method and field management, although additional research is needed to assess the importance of management on soil chemical properties and many fields indicate an opportunity for improvement in fertilizer management."

Also, the quality is evolving, where Ultra High Definition 4K and even 8K resolutions are currently being demonstrated.This paper is a study on the aesthetic nature of Ambient Video art which is produced to create spatial atmosphere and visual pleasure through digital screens that have settled into our everyday life spaces, such as television, computer monitors, and wall monitors. Ambient Video can be considered as (moving) video paintings that achieves the very role framed pictures carry out. It is a form of new-media, enabled by the development of computer graphics technology like digital compositing and special effects, requiring distinguished features compared from conventional idioms of original video mediums.The purpose of Ambient Video, the main subject of this paper, is emotional communication. Ambient Video values slow forms and depictive expression and does not seek for conventional video expressions with linear narrative structures like those in movies or television programs which tend to draw substantial attention from the viewers, nor does it depend on temporal montage to generate fictional reality. Ambient Video pursues a new kind of aesthetics featuring natural compositions, modifications, and continuity via the improvements of digital compositing techniques. This paper endeavors on establishing the aesthetic Characteristics of Ambient Video through theoretical considerations on new media video aesthetics and case analysis on video artworks."

A broadband echo acquisition and processing system operating over the frequency range of 85-225 kHz was used to collect and process species-specific, time-frequency feature images from six fish species: black rockfish Sebastes schlegeli, black scraper Thamnaconus modesutus [K], chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, goldeye rockfish Sebastes thompsoni, konoshiro gizzard shad Konosirus punctatus and large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea. An ANN classifier was developed to identify fish species acoustically on the basis of only 100 dimension time-frequency features extracted by the principal components analysis (PCA). The overall mean identification rate for the six fish species was 88.5%, with individual identification rates of 76.6% for black rockfish, 82.8% for black scraper, 93.8% for chub mackerel, 90.6% for goldeye rockfish, 96.9% for konoshiro gizzard shad and 90.6% for large yellow croaker, respectively. These results demonstrate that individual live fish in well-controlled environments can be identified accurately by the proposed ANN model."

The emerging Manzhouguo had to exercise exclusive control by taking over the northeastern marine customs as a means of implementing an independent tariff policy.It was, however, an essential issue to the China government, Japan, and other powers that set tariffs as the security of foreign loan were intersecting each other sharply. The Chinese government complained about the illegal nature of Manzhouguo’s acquisition of northeastern maritime customs to the League of Nations and attempted to resolve the issue diplomatically via the capabilities of powers. The U.K., the U.S.A., and other powers, however, stressed the stability of paying foreign loans for tariffs and urged the Chinese government to reach a compromise with Manzhouguo.Manzhouguo kept its promise of sharing the burden of northeastern maritime customs regarding the payment of foreign debt security, thus preventing the issue from escalating into a case of national interference or into a diplomacy matter that would concern the powers. Given the changes to the Northeast Asian markets after the foundation of Manzhouguo, its revision of tariffs and acquisition of northeastern maritime customs as premises became important historical events."
Status and Changes in Chemical Properties of Paddy Soil in Gangwon Province,2016,"['Paddy soil', 'Chemical property', 'Heavy metal', 'Gangwon']",,"The chemical properties of paddy fields in Gangwon province were monitored every 4 years from 2003 to 2015 in order to provide basic information for soil fertility management of paddy fields. In 2015, the soil chemical properties of paddy fields were 5.9 in pH, 22 g kg-1 in organic matter (OM), and 123 mg kg-1 in available (Avail.) phosphate P2O5. Exchangeable (Exch.) potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) were 0.39, 4.8 and 0.9 cmolc kg-1, respectively, and Avail. SiO2 was 170 mg kg-1. In the long-term analysis, the contents of Avail. SiO2, Exch. K and pH of paddy soils showed increasing tendency. However, Avail. P2O5, Exch. Ca and Mg tended to decrease, and there were no significant changes in the contents of OM. Soil OM, Avail. P2O5 and SiO2 were not different among the different topographical sampling sites. However, the mean value of Exch. K and Ca were different among the different topographical sampling sites, and exceeded optimal values in the fluvio-marine plains. Different soil texture resulted in different soil pH, while no difference for OM, Avail. P2O5 and SiO2. Paddy soil samples within appropriate pH range increased from 65% in 2003 to 77% in 2007, 68% in 2011, and 71% in 2015. In case of Avail.

Meanwhile, Cd and Pb were distributed to less than 5% of soil pollution standards. Cu, As and Zn were distributed to less than 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively. Therefore, paddy soil in Gangwon Province was judged to be safe. As a result, paddy fields with more or less in nutrient level need to be fertilized based on the soil analysis. And the application of silicate fertilizer is strongly recommended to those of paddy fields in need. In addition, soil management including the cultivation of green manure crop or application of rice straw is necessary to increase the organic matter content of paddy soil."

Methods: We retrospectively investigated the incidence and features of cognitive dysfunction using the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-K) in ED patients with CO poisoning with alert mental status. We conducted a retrospective review of 43 consecutive mild CO poisoned patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 based on documentation by the treating emergency physician in the ED between July 2014 and August 2015. Results: Cognitive dysfunction, defined as a score of less than 24 in the MMSE-K, was diagnosed in six patients (14%) in the ED. In the MMSE-K, orientation to time, memory recall, and concentration/calculation showed greater impairments. The mean age was significantly older in the cognitive dysfunction group than the non-cognitive dysfunction group (45.3 yrs vs. 66.5 yrs, p<0.001). Among the initial symptoms, experience of a transient change in mental status before ED arrival was significantly more common in the cognitive dysfunction group (32.4% vs. 100%, p=0.003).

Seven treatments include nitrogen (N, 13.8 g·m(-2)), phosphorus (P, 6.1 g·m(-2)), potassium (K, 7.5 g·m(-2)) fertilization and 1x (N 6.9·g m(-2), P 3.05 g·m(-2), K 3.65 g·m(-2)), 2x (twice of 1x), 4x (four times of 1x) fertilization and no fertilization. Soil pH decreased as fertilization increased. Nitrogen and NPK fertilization decreased exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations. Height and root collar diameter of F. rhynchophylla and F. mandshurica significantly increased with N and NPK fertilization, but those of P. koraiensis and A. holophylla did not. The biomass of F. rhynchophylla and F. mandshurica was about twice higher at NPK fertilization compared to the control. The responses of vector diagnosis were different by tree species and fertilization treatment: F. rhynchophylla was in the status of N dilution, which means the N concentration decreases with N content. Phosphorus and K were sufficiency state with 4x fertilization. F. mandshurica showed retranslocation as N content decreased without change of dry weight at N, P, K fertilization, but dilution state at NPK fertilization. This result suggested that optimal fertilization was required for F. rhynchophylla and F. mandshurica in seedling production stage, but was not essential for P. koraiensis and A. holophylla."

The twinboundaries had a considerable influence on reductions of the latticethermal conductivity due to phonon scattering by the nano-orderedlayers and on reductions of the electrical resistivity owing to thedefects generated by the substitution of Na into the cation sites. Here,we report the enhanced thermoelectric properties of a Na-doped p-typeBi0.5Sb1.5Te3 alloy. Measurements show that the electrical resistivityand the Seebeck coefficient decrease with Na doping due to anincrease in the free carrier (hole) concentration and that the latticethermal conductivity decreases with Na doping. The achievedmaximum ZT value was 1.20 at 423 K, which is approximately 20%higher than that of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 under the same fabrication conditions. These results were achievable by controlling the morphology of thetwin structure and the carrier concentration by means of Na doping."

Thus, the assessment of cosmetic results and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) using appropriately constructed and validated instruments is essential. The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term objective cosmetic results and corresponding PROs after oncoplastic breast surgery.  Methods: Cosmetic results were assessed by the patients, a medical panel, and a computer program (BCCT.core). PROs were assessed using BREAST-Q, a questionnaire that measures the perception of patients having breast surgery. The cosmetic results and PROs were analyzed in patients who underwent quadrantectomy and partial breast reconstruction utilizing the latissimus dorsi flap.  Results: The mean duration of the follow-up period was 91.6 months (range, 33.3–171.0 months), and mean age of the patients was 51 years old (range, 33–72 years). The mean tumor size was 2.1 cm (range, 0.9–5.5 cm). There was fair agreement between the medical panel and BCCT.core score (K = 0.32, P < 0.001), and a statistically significant correlation between the BCCT.core score and medical panel cosmetic results was identified (r = 0.606, P < 0.001).

Halotolerant Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria Mediated Salinity Stress Amelioration in Plants,2016,"['Soil salinity', 'Saline', 'Sodic', 'Saline-sodic', 'Plant growth promoting bacteria', '1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)']",,"Soil salinization refers to the buildup of salts in soil to a level toxic to plants. The major factors that contribute to soil salinity are the quality, the amount and the type of irrigation water used. The presented review discusses the different sources and causes of soil salinity. The effect of soil salinity on biological processes of plants is also discussed in detail. This is followed by a debate on the influence of salt on the nutrient uptake and growth of plants. Salinity decreases the soil osmotic potential and hinders water uptake by the plants. Soil salinity affects the plants K uptake, which plays a critical role in plant metabolism due to the high concentration of soluble sodium (Na<SUP>+</SUP>) ions. Visual symptoms that appear in the plants as a result of salinity include stunted plant growth, marginal leaf necrosis and fruit distortions. Different strategies to ameliorate salt stress globally include breeding of salt tolerant cultivars, irrigation to leach excessive salt to improve soil physical and chemical properties. As part of an ecofriendly means to alleviate salt stress and an increasing considerable attention on this area, the review then focuses on the different plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) mediated mechanisms with a special emphasis on ACC deaminase producing bacteria. The various strategies adopted by PGPB to alleviate various stresses in plants include the production of different osmolytes, stress related phytohormones and production of molecules related to stress signaling such as bacterial 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate(ACC) derivatives. The use of PGPB with ACC deaminase producing trait could be effective in promoting plant growth in agricultural areas affected by different stresses including salt stress. Finally, the review ends with a discussion on the various PGPB activities and the potentiality of facultative halophilic/halotolerant PGPB in alleviating salt stress."

(2015). Although the CSW_v2.0 retrieved the LST with a reasonable quality compared to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data, it showed a relatively poor performance for the strong inversion and lapse rate conditions. To solve this problem, the LST retrieval algorithm (CSW_v2.0) was updated using the simulation results of radiative transfer model (MODTRAN 4.0) by considering the diurnal variations of air temperature. In general, the upgraded version, CSW_v3.0 showed a similar correlation coefficient between the prescribed LSTs and retrieved LSTs (0.99), the relatively smaller bias (from -0.03 K to-0.012 K) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (from 1.39 K to 1.138 K). Particularly, CSW_v3.0 improved the systematic problems of CSW_v2.0 that were encountered when temperature differences between LST and air temperature are very large and/or small (inversion layers and superadiabatic lapse rates), and when the brightness temperature differences and surface emissivity differences were large. The bias and RMSE of CSW_v2.0 were reduced by 10-30% in CSW_v3.0. The indirect validation results using the MODIS LST data showed that CSW_3.0 improved the retrieval accuracy of LST in terms of bias (from -0.629 K to -0.049 K) and RMSE (from 2.537 K to 2.502 K) compared to the CSW_v2.0."

The RTK method employs super position of tri-triangles, and each triangle (called, unit hydrograph) is defined by three parameters (i.e., R, T and K) determined/optimized using Genetic Algorithm (GA). In regression method, the MovingAverage (MA) filtering was used for data processing. Accuracies of RDII predictions from these two approaches were evaluated by comparing the root mean square error (RMSE) values from each model, in which the values were calculated to 320.613 (RTK method) and 420.653 (regression method), respectively. As a results, the RTK method was found to be more suitable for RDII prediction during extreme rainfall event, than the regression method."

Block Tearing and Local Buckling of Aluminum Alloy Gusset Joint Plates,2016,"['aluminum alloy gusset joint', 'resistance', 'block tearing', 'local buckling', 'theoretical formulae', 'design criteria']",,"Aluminum Alloy Gusset (AAG) joints widely used in the single-layer latticed shells have a significant application prospect in spatial structures. Unfortunately, studies on the resistance of AAG joints are insufficient, leading to a lack of applicative design methods for this joint system. This paper is devoted to investigate the resistance of AAG joint plates. Firstly, tests on fourteen AAG joint specimens are carried out to explore their collapse modes. Experimental phenomena show that the main collapse modes of AAG joint plates include the block tearing of top plates and the local buckling of bottom plates. Secondly, Finite Element (FE) simulations to investigate the mechanical behavior of AAG joints are performed by means of the non-linear FE code ABAQUS. Thirdly, formulae for predicting the block tearing resistance and the local buckling resistance of AAG joint plates are proposed, which are based on theoretical analyses. Fourthly, test results are of great help in the determination of parameters k and α which are adopted to modify the block tearing resistance and the local buckling resistance respectively.

Halotolerant Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria Mediated Salinity Stress Amelioration in Plants,2016,"['Soil salinity', 'Saline', 'Sodic', 'Saline-sodic', 'Plant growth promoting bacteria', '1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)']",,"Soil salinization refers to the buildup of salts in soil to a level toxic to plants. The major factors that contribute to soil salinity are the quality, the amount and the type of irrigation water used. The presented review discusses the different sources and causes of soil salinity. The effect of soil salinity on biological processes of plants is also discussed in detail. This is followed by a debate on the influence of salt on the nutrient uptake and growth of plants. Salinity decreases the soil osmotic potential and hinders water uptake by the plants. Soil salinity affects the plants K uptake, which plays a critical role in plant metabolism due to the high concentration of soluble sodium ($Na^+$) ions. Visual symptoms that appear in the plants as a result of salinity include stunted plant growth, marginal leaf necrosis and fruit distortions. Different strategies to ameliorate salt stress globally include breeding of salt tolerant cultivars, irrigation to leach excessive salt to improve soil physical and chemical properties. As part of an ecofriendly means to alleviate salt stress and an increasing considerable attention on this area, the review then focuses on the different plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) mediated mechanisms with a special emphasis on ACC deaminase producing bacteria. The various strategies adopted by PGPB to alleviate various stresses in plants include the production of different osmolytes, stress related phytohormones and production of molecules related to stress signaling such as bacterial 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) derivatives. The use of PGPB with ACC deaminase producing trait could be effective in promoting plant growth in agricultural areas affected by different stresses including salt stress. Finally, the review ends with a discussion on the various PGPB activities and the potentiality of facultative halophilic/halotolerant PGPB in alleviating salt stress."
알츠하이머병과 경도인지장애에서 헤모글로빈 농도와 인지기능과의 연관성,2016,,,"Objectives : Anemia is a common problem in the management of elderly patients. Recent studies reported that anemia was associated with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. This study was aimed to analyze the differences of hemoglobin levels in Korean patients with Alzheimer's disease(AD) dementia, mild cognitive impairment(MCI), and healthy controls. Furthermore, the study also examined if any association between hemoglobin levels and cognitive functions existed. Methods : A total of 116 Korean elderly adults were participated in this study(mean age 74.67 years ; 60.3% female). The Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE-K), Clinical Dementia Rating(CDR) and Global Deterioration Scale(GDS) were applied to all subjects. Hematological and related blood chemistry values were investigated. Results : We found that patients with AD dementia had significantly lower hemoglobin and hematocrit levels than MCI subjects and healthy control group. The hemoglobin levels showed a positive correlation with MMSE-K and negative correlation with CDR, GDS. Conclusions : Among Korean elderly, low hemoglobin level is associated with a cognitive impairment. This study indicates that AD is associated with anemia, and low hemoglobin levels may contribute to potentially useful clinical markers of AD. The risk factor for dementia needs to be confirmed by prospective longitudinal studies in a larger group of patients."
Assessing Soil Fertility Status of Edible Wild Plants Fields in Ulleung Island,2016,"['Edible wild plant', 'Aster glehnii', 'Codonopsis lanceolata', 'Athyrium acutipinnulum', 'Solidago virgaurea subsp', 'gigantean', 'Aruncus dioicus var', 'kamtschaticus', 'Allium ochotense', 'Soil chemicals']",,"The perennial edible wild plants such as Aster glehnii, Solidago virgaurea subsp. gigantean, Allium ochotense, Athyrium acutipinnulum, Aruncus dioicus var. kamtschaticus and Codonopsis lanceolata have cultivated as the main income crops introduced into the fields about 30 years ago in Ulleung island. Soil samples were collected from 190 fields and assessed the effects of management practices on soil chemical properties at wild edible plant fields under no-till system. The strong acidic soils of pH 5.4 or less were detected in 45% of the soil samples. The level of soil organic matter was being held at mean $63{\pm}28g\;kg^{-1}$, 2.7 times higher than upland soils in Korea. Available phosphate and exchangeable potassium showed more than recommended levels of upland crops as $680{\pm}489mg\;kg^{-1}$ and $1.94{\pm}1.7cmol_c\;kg^{-1}$, respectively. The fields of Solidago and Aster showing strong soil acidity and high level of available phosphate and water soluble $NO_3{^-}$ were distinguished from other crops in analysis of variance and principal component analysis of soil chemicals. These results suggested that high frequency of acidic soil and high levels of available $P_2O_5$, exchangeable $K_2O$ and water soluble $NO_3{^-}$ were accompanied with the use of urea and NPK-fertilizer based on nitrogen in the field. However, further research is needed to understand the appropriate management of fertilization and the prevention of soil acidification for wild edible plants."
Epitaxial Growth of Strain-Induced Ferromagnetic LaCoO3 Thin Films by Simple Sol–Gel Technique,2016,"['LaCoO3', 'sol–gel technique', 'epitaxial film', 'ferromagnetism']",,"LaCoO3 (LCO) epitaxial films were grown on (001) LaAlO3 (LAO) substrates by the simple sol– gel technique. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the cross-section transmission electron microscope (TEM) measurements indicate that single-phase (001) oriented LCO epitaxial films with biaxial compressive strain and elongated distortion of CoO6 octahedrons were grown on (001) LAO successfully. The epitaxial relationship between the LCO film and the LAO substrate is confirmed to be (001)LCO||(001)LAO and [100]LCO||[100]LAO. It is also found that LCO grown on LAO has a larger mean Co–O bond length and unit-cell size, compared with those of polycrystalline film. In addition, the magnetic characterization shows that LCO epitaxial film exhibits an obvious ferromagnetic (FM) transition at TC ~ 85 K, which is different from the nonmagnetic ground state of polycrystalline LCO. Combined with the structural analyses, it reveals that the strain-induced ferromagnetism observed in LCO epitaxial film originates from an increase of the mean Co–O bond length and a suppression of the CoO6 octahedral rotations, which can stabilize higher spin state of Co3+ by a decrease of the eg~t2g gap energy."

We also checked the correlation between each pair of variables of the symptoms and curative rates of patients with cough. Methods: Thirty-three patients with cough who had satisfied the selection criteria were retrospectively reviewed through their basic medical records, nasal endoscopy, and questionnaires about cough on their first and second visits. The questionnaires used were ""The questionnaire on clinical symptoms of cough & sputum"", Leicester Cough Questionnaire Korean Version (LCQ-K), Total Nasal Symptom Scores (TNSS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and ""Cold-heat patterns"". The improvement rate, calculated by ""The questionnaire on clinical symptoms of cough & sputum"" was considered to be clinically effective if reduction of symptoms scored more than 30%. The state of nasopharyngeal mucosa was assessed to categorize the cold-heat patterns of the upper respiratory tract and for diagnosis. Results: According to this study, cough and sputum improved by $57.22{\pm}37.76%$. Most patients (76%) improved significantly after $12.18{\pm}6.59days$ of taking Eunhwayeongyo-tang. The cure rates of 26 patients among the 33 patients were judged as effective. All the mean scores of the questionnaires and the anterior nasal cavity states were significantly improved on the patients' second visits. After $18.39{\pm}15.68days$, 30 patients were completely cured and ended treatment. The nasopharyngeal mucosa states of all patients were categorized as heat patterns. Conclusions: The conditions of the patients with nasopharyngitis significantly improved after taking Eunhwayeongyo-tang. All of the patients had pharyngitis or rhinitis. The cold-heat pattern of nasopharyngeal mucosa was a significant indicator of upper respiratory inflammation diagnosis."
Lossless and lossy compression of quantitative phase images of red blood cells obtained by digital holographic imaging,2016,,,"<P>In this paper, we evaluate lossless and lossy compression techniques to compress quantitative phase images of red blood cells (RBCs) obtained by an off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM). The RBC phase images are numerically reconstructed from their digital holograms and are stored in 16-bit unsigned integer format. In the case of lossless compression, predictive coding of JPEG lossless (JPEG-LS), JPEG2000, and JP3D are evaluated, and compression ratio (CR) and complexity (compression time) are compared against each other. It turns out that JP2k can outperform other methods by having the best CR. In the lossy case, JP2k and JP3D with different CRs are examined. Because some data is lost in a lossy way, the degradation level is measured by comparing different morphological and biochemical parameters of RBC before and after compression. Morphological parameters are volume, surface area, RBC diameter, sphericity index, and the biochemical cell parameter is mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). Experimental results show that JP2k outperforms JP3D not only in terms of mean square error (MSE) when CR increases, but also in compression time in the lossy compression way. In addition, our compression results with both algorithms demonstrate that with high CR values the three-dimensional profile of RBC can be preserved and morphological and biochemical parameters can still be within the range of reported values.

"Stability of Zirconium Metal Organic Frameworks with 9,10- Dicarboxylic Acid Anthracene as Ligand",2016,"['Zirconium metal organic framework materials', 'UIO-66', 'Structure stability', 'Ligands', '9', '10- dicarboxylic acid anthracene']",,"With high specific surface area and pore structural diversity, MOFs show important applications in gas storage, catalysis, sensing, separation, and biomedicine. However, the stability of the structure of MOFs has restricted their application and development. In this study, zirconium metal organic frameworks with 9,10-dicarboxylic acid anthracene as ligand, named UIO-66 ($H_2DCA$), were synthesized and their properties and structures were characterized by XRD, SEM, and $N_2$ adsorption. We focus on the stability of the structure of UIO-66 ($H_2DCA$) under different conditions (acid, alkali, and water). The structural changes or ruins of UIO-66 ($H_2DCA$) were traced by means of XRD, TG, and FT-IR under different conditions. The results show that the UIO-66 ($H_2DCA$) materials are stable at 583 K, and that this structural stability is greatly influenced by different types of acid and alkali compounds. Importantly, we found that the structures maintain their stability in environments of nitric acid, triethylamine, and boiling water."
섬광의 적외선 특성 연구,2016,,,"To effectively utilize a flash and predict its effects on an infrared device, it is essential to know the infrared characteristics of the flash source. In this paper, a study of the IR characteristics of flash light sources is carried out. The IR characteristics of three flash sources, of which two are combustive and the other is explosive, are measured with an IR characteristic measurement system over the middle- and long-wavelength infrared ranges. From the measurements, the radiances over the two IR ranges and the radiative temperatures of the flashes are extracted. The IR radiance of flash A is found to be the strongest among the three, followed by those of sources C and B. It is also shown that the IR radiance of flash A is about 10 times stronger than that of flash B, even though these two sources are the same type of flash with the same powder. This means that the IR radiance intensity of a combustive flash source depends only on the amount of powder, not on the characteristics of the powder. From the measured radiance over MWIR and LWIR ranges for each flashes, the radiative temperatures of the flashes are extracted by fitting the measured data to blackbody radiance. The best-fit radiative temperatures (equivalent to black-body temperatures) of the three flash sources A, B, and C are 3300, 1120, and 1640 K respectively. From the radiance measurements and radiative temperatures of the three flash sources, it is shown that a combustive source radiates more IR energy than an explosive one; this mean, in turn, that the effects of a combustive flash on an IR device are more profound than those of an explosive flash source. The measured IR radiances and radiative temperatures of the flash sources in this study can be used to estimate the effects of flashes on various IR devices, and play a critical role for the modeling and simulation of the effects of a flash source on various IR devices."

Especially, the rainfall rate data of the weather radar are used to validate the new 2-D and 3-DCRR calibration matrixes suitable for the Korean peninsula for the period of 24 rainy days in 2011. The 2D and 3D calibration matrixes provide the basic and maximum CRR values (mm h−1) by multiplying the rain probability matrix, which is calculated by using the number of rainy and no-rainy pixels with associated 2-D (IR, IR-WV) and 3-D(IR, IR-WV, VIS) matrixes, by the mean and maximum rainfall rate matrixes, respectively, which is calculated by dividing the accumulated rainfall rate by the number of rainy pixels and by the product of the maximum rain rate for the calibration period by the number of rain occurrences. Finally, new 2-D and 3-D CRR calibration matrixes are obtained experimentally from the regression analysis of both basic and maximum rainfall rate matrixes. As a result, an area of rainfall rate more than 10 mm/h is magnified in the new ones as well as CRR is shown in lower class ranges in matrixes between IR brightness temperature and IR-WV brightness temperature difference than the existing ones. Accuracy and categorical statistics are computed for the data of CRR events occurred during the given period. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squire error (RMSE) in new 2-D and 3-D CRR calibrations led to smaller than in the existing ones, where false alarm ratio had decreased, probability of detection had increased a bit, and critical success index scores had improved. To take into account the strong rainfall rate in the weather events such as thunderstorms and typhoon, a moisture correction factor is corrected. This factor is defined as the product of the total precipitable waterby the relative humidity (PW·RH), a mean value between surface and 500 hPa level, obtained from a numerical model or the COMS retrieval data. In this study, when the IR cloud top brightness temperature is lower than 210 K and the relative humidity is greater than 40%, the moisture correction factor is empirically scaled from 1.0 to 2.0 basing on PW·RH values. Consequently, in applying to this factor in new 2D and 2D CRR calibrations, the ME, MAE, and RMSE are smaller than the new ones."
One pot synthesis of environmentally friendly lignin nanoparticles with compressed liquid carbon dioxide as an antisolvent,2016,,,"<P>Nanoparticles from commercial kraft lignin were developed using a facile, one pot green technology of a compressed CO2 antisolvent. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was employed as an organic solvent to prepare the lignin solution. The effects of various process parameters: temperature, pressure, solution flow rate and initial solution concentration, on the product yields, morphology, size, size distribution, surface area and textural properties of the particles were investigated by FESEM, HRTEM analyses and BET analyzers, and their formation mechanisms were deduced by the solubility behavior of lignin with liquid CO2 and DMF in the operating system. Moreover, the quality of lignin nanoparticles were elucidated by ATR-FTIR, XPS, XRD, DSC, TG/DTA and UV-vis measurements. This study showed that as the temperature and lignin concentration increased, and the pressure and solution flow rate decreased, the degree of particle aggregation/coalescence and the size increased along with the broader size distribution. In particular, the coalescence of particles was strongly influenced by the operational pressure, and even more significant with the increasing temperature. As a result, uniform, quasi-spherical nanoparticles with a mean particle diameter of 38 nm were obtained at 280.2 K, 15.0 MPa, and 0.06 kg h(-1) of the solution flow rate and 5.3 wt% of the initial lignin concentration. Besides, the lignin nanoparticles have a relatively high BET surface area (nearly 92 m(2) g(-1)) which primarily consisted of mesopores, and exhibited higher UV absorbing and dispersion stability, enhanced solubility, and homogeneous thermal degradation activity as compared with the raw lignin. Noteworthily, their biodegradable and biocompatible character may render them a candidate for applications in cosmetics, health and drug delivery systems.</P>"
Status of Radiation Dose and Radioactive Contamination due to the Fukushima Accident,2016,"['Fukushima accident', 'Radiation exposure', 'Health management', 'Radioactive contamination', 'Foods', 'Drinks']",,"Backgrounds: The accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), March 2011, caused serious radioactive contamination over wide area in east Japan. Therefore, it is important to know the effect of the accident and the status of NPP. Materials and Methods: This paper provides a review on the status of radiation dose and radioactive contamination caused by the accident on the basis of publicized information. Results and Discussion: Monitoring of radiation dose and exposure dose of residents has been conducted extensively by the governments and various organizations. The effective dose of general residents due to the accident proved to be less than a mSv both for external and internal dose. The equivalent committed dose of thyroid was evaluated to be a few mSv in mean value and less than 50 mSv even for children. Monitoring of radioactivity concentration has been carried out on food ingredients, milk and tap water, and actual meal. These studies indicated the percentage of foods above the regulation standard was over 10% in 2011 but decreasing steadily with time. The internal dose due to foods proved to be tens of ${\mu}Sv$ and much less than that due to natural $^{40}K$ even in the Fukushima area and decreasing steadily, although high level concentration is still observed in wild plants, wild mushrooms, animals and some kind of fishes. Conclusion: According to extensive studies, not only the effect of the accident but also the pathway and countermeasures against radioactive contamination have been revealed, and they are applied very effectively for restoration of environment and reconstruction of the area."

INTERACTIONS OF THE INFRARED BUBBLE N4 WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS,2016,,,"<P>The physical mechanisms that induce the transformation of a certain mass of gas in new stars are far from being well understood.

Using Herschel PACS and SPIRE images with a wide wavelength coverage, we reveal the dust properties over the entire bubble. Meanwhile, we are able to identify six dust clumps surrounding the bubble, with a mean size of 0.50 pc, temperature of about 22 K, mean column density of 1.7 x 10(22) cm(-2), mean volume density of about 4.4 x 10(4) cm(-3), and a mean mass of 320M(circle dot). In addition, from PAH emission seen at 8 mu m, free-free emission detected at 20 cm, and a probability density function in special regions, we could identify clear signatures of the influence of the H II region on the surroundings. There are hints of star formation, though further investigation is required to demonstrate that N4 is the triggering source.</P>"
차입매수(Leveraged Buyout)와 배임죄,2016,"['인수&#8901', '합병', '차입매수', '배임', '담보', '회계기준', 'Mergers and Acquisitions', 'Leveraged Buyout', 'Breach of Trust', 'Collateral for the Loans', 'Accounting Standards']",,"In legal perspective, mergers and acquisitions can be seen as a consolidation of characters. It is a process in which one of the two corporate bodies is absorbed and merged into the other one. In most cases, the corporate body who is acquiring the other usually covers the cost of merger and acquisition. This, on the other hand, puts her in the need of vast amount of financial resource. In order to acquire such resource, the company can use the assets of the company being acquired as collateral for the loans (Leveraged Buyout) allowing the company to takeover another company without committing a lot of capital In Sinhan LBO case, the court assessed the leveraged buyout as the breach of trust and gave a criminal penalty. However, in Hanil LBO case and Onse Communication LBO case, the court did not see the act of leveraged buyout as the breach of trust. The difference between Sinhan LBO case and the other two cases are as follows. In Sinhan LBO case, the company being acquired, S&K World Korea’s assets wereused as collateral for the loans before the actual acquisitions took place. However, in the other two cases, there existed a contract between the companies as to provide the assets of the companies being acquired as collateral for the loans but the provision of security did not happen before the actual acquisitions took place. From this, two questions arise. First is how to define the subject of the damage occurred, and second is the standard for assessing the damage. There are three conflicting theories that try to answer these questions and of those three, the ‘companytheory’ is the most reasonable answer. By applying this theory, the precedent’s stance can be easily understood.Moreover, it can be questioned whether it is justifiable to see the provision of security as damage. In the capitalist society, the trade of goods occurs through the means of money and this money functions as a unifying measure of value. Consequently, when an asset such as real property is provided as security, the value of that specific assetalso decreases by that amount of security. Therefore, it is justifiable to see the provision of security as damage. The precedent refers to this as ‘a risk of property damage’. Furthermore, it can be questioned whether the damage can be acknowledged based on an unfair merger. In the field of accounting, mergers and acquisitions is seen as a purchase. The ｢Corporate Accounting Standards Book(1103rd)｣, lists detailed accounting standards for calculating the acquisition cost and acquisition value during a business merger. According to this standard, the company may be sold at a price that is lower or higher than its actual value but as long as it does not exceed the usual trade custom, it is difficult to see an unfair merger as damage."
보르도 와인과 부르고뉴 와인의 대조적 특성,2016,"['보르도', '부르고뉴', '샤토', '클리마', '퀴베', 'Bordeaux', 'Bourgogne', 'chateau', 'climats', 'cuvee']",,"This study aims to compare and discuss wine of the world`s most famous regions for wine production, Bordeaux and Bourgogne from the contrasting perspective and to reveal unique characteristics of the wine of the two regions, which have extreme diversity. Bordeaux wine and Bourgogne wine are so diverse that it may not be easy to conduct an analysis contrasting them, but this paper would describe them, focusing on their aspects with distinctive features. This is because it is judged that there are no other regions that show more distinctive features than these two regions, of the regions of wine production in the world. Bordeaux wine is historically considered to have a close relationship with the United Kingdom. This is to say that Bordeaux became a territory of the U.K. in the 12th century and became that of France in the 13th century, and the wine industry was developed greatly thanks to the British Monarchy. In other words, unlike wine in other regions of France, it enjoyed a privilege in exporting wine and this privilege lasted till the 18th century. In contrast, it is noted that Bourgogne wine was maintained and developed by church unlike Bordeaux wine. In fact, in the Middle Ages, the church was the pivot of vine culture in any place throughout the Europe. This is because wine at the time was altar wine of all Christians, and therefore, vine culture was maintained by the church and continuously handed down to the posterity. Cluny Abbey and Citeaux Abbey in Bourgogne played these roles. Bordeaux wine is a blended wine. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are its representative blending varieties. A big reason for blending in Bordeaux may be the climate there. We may note that Bourgogne wine is brewed with a single variety, no matter whether it is white wine or red wine. In addition, we can also point out that, in the Bourgogne region, no Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot varieties, which are the main varieties in the Bordeaux region, are grown. This may be because the climate is different and the soil on which grapes are grown differs, but it would be more reasonable that these two regions make efforts to produce a unique wine with a character of their own, rather than pursuing wine with a taste similar to that of each other. This is because the same variety can be grown in a different climate, soil and even in a different continent, as wine experts, too, point out, and because wine brewed with the same variety is considered one with a similar taste even if grown in a different soil. Bordeaux wine is considered Chateau wine. In other words, the name Chateau is marked on most of the wine labels. However, the term Chateau is a term that hardly means architecture where medieval lords lived. It seems that it was used to mean a vineyard that refers to one that produces commercially premium wine only. Bourgogne wine is Clima wine. Like the term Chateau on Bordeaux wine, the name Clima is used on most of the premium Bourgogne wine labels. Clima determines the grade of Bourgogne wine as well. Many famous vineyards in the Bordeaux region have mass produced wine from a long time ago, while those in the Bourgogne region have a characteristic of production in small quantities. In other words, Bordeaux vineyard owners own a large number of vineyards while Bourgogne vineyard owners own only very small vineyards. Based on this fact, it can be argued that vineyard owners in the two regions present a distinct contrast to each other. In other words, Bordeaux vineyard owners show an image of bourgeois, while Bourgogne vineyard owners show a rustic appearance. Consumers of Bordeaux wine and Bourgogne wine, also, are definitely distinguished from each other. Bordeaux wine was consumed mainly in the United Kingdom while Bourgogne wine was consumed mainly in the Continent. It is very interesting that the bottle shape is certainly different between the two regions. This, too, is one of the grounds that the vineyards in the two regions produce very characteristic wine."

The conclusions obtained from this study were as follows; 1) In generally, swimming groups were significantly lower than control group in TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C and TC/HDL-C ratio (p＜.001). 2) In HDL-C, 30 min. loaded swimming group and 60 min. unloaded swimming group were significantly higher than control group, 30 min. unloaded swimming group and 60 min. loaded swimming group (p＜.01). In conclusion, this study suggested that regular swimming is effectively enhanced partly on serum lipid profiles in hyperlipidemic state by exercise intensity and duration."
Quantitative Definition and Spatiotemporal Distribution of Little Water Season (LIWAS) in Korea,2016,"['Little water season', 'available water resources index', 'little water intensity', 'water deficit intensity']",,"Like other continental climatic regions Korea has a period around the spring when agricultural activities are interrupted frequently by a shortage of available water resources during the season.This season, which is termed the Little Water Season (LIWAS) in this study, has important implications for many socio-economic activities but the scientific definition of this season remains vague. In this study, the onset and termination dates, as well as the characteristics of the LIWAS have been defined based on the Available Water Resources Index (AWRI). Based on the proposed definition of LIWAS, the implications on hydrological conditions over a range of geographic scales and their inter-annual variations on the water resource environments in Korea have been assessed. To develop an appropriate index for LIWAS based on AWRI, the criterion value (CV) for LIWAS was set as the lowest 25th percentile of the AWRI values averaged for 30 years (1981-2010). Therefore, the Little Water Season for Korea (LIWAS_K) was considered as the period when the daily averaged AWRIs were successively lower than the CV (143.7 mm). Based on this, the mean onset and end date of LIWAS_K, was 9 February and 11 May which also reflected the period in the spring season when the available water resources are expected to the lowest. Moreover, a number of seasonal characteristics of the water availability during the LIWAS, such as the Little Water Intensity (LWI), Water Deficit Amount (WDA) and Water Deficit Intensity (WDI) have been defined for the particular study region. Based on our results, we aver that the proposed season classification of the LIWAS can be better analyzed using the concept of usable water resources as a classification of dry period instead of using temperature and raw rainfall datasets."

We use the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to consider the spatial heterogeneity of data collected by administrative district in order to estimate the model. As GWR is spatial analysis techniques utilizing the spatial information, regression model estimated for each region on the assumption that regression coefficients are different by region. Results: As a result of estimating model of the collected air pollution index, circulatory diseases mortality data combined with the spatial information, GWR was found to solve the problem of spatial autocorrelation and increase the fit of the model than OLS regression model. Conclusion: GWR is used to select the air pollution affecting the disease each year, the K means cluster analysis discover the characteristics of the distribution of air pollution by region."
Assessment of Diffusion-Weighted Imaging-FLAIR Mismatch: Comparison between Conventional FLAIR versus Shorter-Repetition-Time FLAIR at 3T,2016,"['Acute ischemic stroke', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Diffusion-weighted imaging', 'Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery']",,"Purpose: Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging can be obtained faster with shorter repletion time (TR), but it gets noisier. We hypothesized that shorter- TR FLAIR obtained at 3 tesla (3T) with a 32-channel coil may be comparable to conventional FLAIR. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic value between conventional FLAIR (TR = 9000 ms, FLAIR9000) and shorter-TR FLAIR (TR = 6000 ms, FLAIR6000) at 3T in terms of diffusion-weighted imaging-FLAIR mismatch.Materials and Methods: We recruited 184 patients with acute ischemic stroke (28 patients < 4.5 hours) who had undergone 5-mm diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and two successive 5-mm FLAIR images (no gap; in-plane resolution, 0.9 x 0.9 mm) at 3T with a 32-channel coil. The acquisition times for FLAIR9000 and FLAIR6000 were 108 seconds (generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions [GRAPPA] = 2) and 60 seconds (GRAPPA = 3), respectively. Two radiologists independently assessed the paired imaging sets (DWI-FLAIR9000 and DWI-FLAIR6000) for the presence of matched hyperintense lesions on each FLAIR imaging. The signal intensity ratios (area of DWI lesion to contralateral normal-appearing region) on both FLAIR imaging sets were compared.Results: DWI-FLAIR9000 mismatch was present in 39 of 184 (21.2%) patients, which was perfectly the same on FLAIR6000. Three of 145 patients (2%) with DWImatched lesions on FLAIR9000 had discrepancy on FLAIR6000, showing no significant difference (P > 0.05). Interobserver agreement was excellent for both DWI-FLAIR9000 and DWI-FLAIR6000 (k = 0.904 and 0.883, respectively). Between the two FLAIR imaging sets, there was no significant difference of signal intensity ratio (mean, standard deviation; 1.25 ± 0.20; 1.24 ± 0.20, respectively) (P > 0.05).Conclusion: For the determination of mismatch or match between DWI and FLAIR imaging, there is no significant difference between FLAIR9000 and FLAIR6000 at 3T with a 32-channel coil."

In a number of major cases of the Supreme Court, It suggested that the 'Doubleness' of tax investigation have the next two factors : the identical tax item, and the same tax period. In other words, the legal meaning that a problematic case has the 'Doubleness' of tax investigation should be based on two tax investigation which happens to examine the identical tax item and the same tax period of a taxpayer twice. This legal interpretation also applies the national income(or corporative) tax and the local income tax cases. However, many taxpayers consider not to agree the interpretation by Courts. Because the national income(or corporative) tax and the local income tax share the identical calculation method of tax base in the income(corporation) tax act or the local tax act.There is, however, the above problem of many taxpayers' dissonance against the legal interpretation about the 'Doubleness' of the tax investigation. This problem should be mediated for securing the reasonableness of the local income tax and taxpayers' consensus.Second, it analyses the Japanese legislative case. This paper focuses on the Japanese local business tax case, because a tax system of this tax item(specially, 'taxation on income' part) is operated similarly such as the Korea does. Japan comes up with legislative measures in the local tax law. Japanese local tax authorities can operate tax investigation system about the local business tax in the local tax law. The japanese local tax law provides that the mandated local authority be depended on the situs of the head office or the effective management office if two or more local authorities can investigate the same taxpayer. By the way, there has maintained with the co-operative administration agreement between the Japanese central government and Local authorities (a.k.a. San-sei-kyouryoku). In conclusion, we may make a co-operative system between the National Tax Service and local authorities any time soon.In addition, we will also revise the local tax act for sharing tax investigation results between the central government and local tax authorities, adjusting individual tax investigation periods between three powers, and making an identical list of tax investigation"

In the U.K., as the validity of all exceptions and limitation of liability clauses which protect the ship-owner is a question of construction, the parties to the contract may rely on an appropriately drafted clauses. Thus, it is highly advisable whether there was an agreement for the exclusion and limitation of the ship-owner s liability or not should be strictly examined, before discussing whether article 769(1) of the Korean Commercial Code (hereunder, KCC) applies to a specific claim or not. Meanwhile, the validity of any clauses exempting or/and limiting ship-owner s liability should be discussed in accordance with the period of the ship-owner s liability. In addition, it should be kept in mind that the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976 (hereunder, the LLMC 1976) has evolved with the close influences from other International Convention which dealt with the carriers  liability. Especially, since the Hague-Visby rules confines the carrier s liability from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time they are discharged from the ship, the meaning of  claims in respect of ··· loss of or damage to property, occurring on board or in direct connection with the operation of the ship  of article 2(1)(a) of the LLMC 1976 should be interpreted that the scope of a ship-owner s limitation of liability is restricted to a carrier s coverage for the carriage of goods under the Hague-Visby rules. Therefore, given the purpose of the LLMC 1976 that the Convention was to extend the right to limit, not to restrict it, a claim for a ship-owner s liability for mis-delivery of goods without exchange of the original bills of lading can be referred in article 2(1)(a) of the LLMC 1976, subject to article 3 and 4 of the LLMC 1976."
보수환수제도의 경제적 효과,2016,"['클로백', '보수환수제도', '재무제표재작성', '유인보상체계', '투자효율성', 'clawback', 'compensation recovery provision', 'financial restatement', 'incentive compensation', 'investment efficiency']",,"This study examines economic effects of compensation recovery provision(clawbacks). Clawbacks are provisions that recover the incentive compensation of the CEO or the board of directors if financial statements are restated(Chan et al. 2012; Chan et al. 2015). While incentive schemes such as earnings-based and equity-based compensation can encourage managers to align managers’ incentives with investors’ wealth, these incentives can inflate reported earnings in order to maximize their utilities by using their discretion(Desai et al. 2006; DeHaan et al. 2013). Prior studies show a positive relation between incentive compensation schemes and accounting restatements(Desai et al. 2006; DeHaan et al. 2013). Prior studies also point out financial restatement occurs due to the CEO incentive compensation contract. Financial restatements can take a toll on the reputational penalties to the managers(Desai et al. 2006). Moreover, financial restatements can undermine shareholder credibility of financial information(Iskandar-Datta and Yonghong 2013). Clawbacks were first adopted by Section 304 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act(SOX) in 2002 in order to mitigate accounting restatement. However, clawbacks under SOX era has been enforced in a few cases due to ambiguities in SOX 304(Fried and Shilon 2011; Chan et al. 2012). In recent years, clawbacks have attracted much attention as an object to deter manager’s financial restatement. Many companies have introduced clawback provisions voluntarily. Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) scrutinized CEO compensation contracts due to the financial crisis in 2007~2008. With Section 954 of Dodd-Frank Act(DFA) in 2010, clawback provisions improve on SOX 304 in that they expand applicable parties of clawbacks and do not require misconduct as a prerequisite(Chan et al. 2012). Futhermore, the SEC proposed that listed companies mandatorily develop and enforce new clawback policies on July 1, 2015. “The proposed rules would result in increased accountability and greater focus on the quality of financial reporting, which will benefit investors and the markets.” said SEC Chair Mary Jo White. What are the beneficial effects of clawbacks on investors and the capital markets? Clawback provisions decrease accounting restatements or earnings management and enhance internal control systems(Chan et al. 2012; DeHaan et al. 2013; Iskandar-Datta and Yonghong 2013). Moreover, investors consider accounting information to be more credible after clawbacks are adopted(Chan et al. 2012; DeHaan et al. 2013; Fung et al. 2015). Taken together, clawback provisions improve reporting quality and diminish financial reporting risk(Iskandar-Datta and Yonghong 2013). About 90% of companies in Fortune 100 index has adopted clawback provisions as of 2013. In 2015, developed countries such as U.S. or U.K. adopted clawbacks mandatorily while Korea does not adopt these compensation recoup provisions yet. I use a mathematical model to examine economic effect of clawback provisions. I find that clawbacks can mitigate the incentive of financial restatement, and improve investment efficiency. Clawback provisions make the CEO report to the investor integritously under incentive compensation scheme. On the other hand, I also show that the usefulness of clawbacks can deteriorate if managers’ ownership increases or if fixed compensation is clawed back. That is, clawback provisions can ex ante enhance reporting quality, and ex post penalize the CEO who manipulate accounting information. Despite the rise of clawbacks as means to diminish accounting restatement in U.S., few have attempted to address clawbacks in Korea. I shed light on important implications of clawbacks for regulators, managers, investors and auditors. Also, it is necessary for regulators to consider the adoption of clawbacks have many advantages."

As a result, they amended the Korean Commercial Code (“KCC”) to introduce shadow director liability. This is a system designed to prevent controlling shareholders’ improper influence over the operation of a business by imposing liability upon those who are involved with the operation either directly or indirectly while not being a director of the corporation. Section 401-2 of the KCC classifies those who are involved with the operation either directly or indirectly into three different categories. First, persons who instruct directors using their influence over the corporation; second, persons who conduct the business of the corporation using the name of a director (unauthorized agent); and third, persons who conduct the business of a corporation using titles that give impression of authorization such as honorary chairman, chairman, president, vice president, executive manager, managing director or director while not being an actual director (apparent director). As for these persons, they will be deemed actual directors for the purposes of applying Sections 399 (liability to the corporation), 401 (liability to a third party), and 403 (derivative litigation) concerning the undertakings they instruct or conduct. In other words, these so-called shadow directs are liable for damages suffered by the corporation or third parties, and may become the target of derivative suits. Also, under Section 401-2 paragraph (1), if a director is liable for damages against the company or a third party, the director shall be jointly and severally liable with such shadow directors. If one considers the development of such concepts in other countries, one can find that, in the United States, controlling shares owe fiduciary duties to minor shareholders in limited circumstances under its common law tradition. As for Germany, Article 117(1) of German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) prescribes that any person who, by exerting his influence over the company, willfully induces a member of the management board or the supervisory board, a registered authorized officer or an authorized signatory to act to the disadvantage to company or its shareholders, shall be liable to the company for any resulting damages. Such person shall also be liable to the shareholders for any resulting damages insofar as they have sustained a loss in addition to the loss which they have sustained due to the damages to the company (so called “indirect damages”). This provision is utilized as means to impose liability with respect to the abuse of controlling shareholder’s position. The shadow director provisions in the U.K. Company Act are also similar to these provisions. This paper analyses eight major Korean cases involving the issues of shadow directors decided after the 1998 Amendment and discusses the significance of these opinions. Specifically, it points out that it is not very practical in Korea to impose liability on a shadow director under Section 401-2 paragraph (1) item 1, because Korea does not have liberal discovery rules that are available under the Anglo-American legal systems. Thus, this paper argues that in some specific situations, there should be a burden-shifting. In addition, it maintains that there must be provisions to impose upon such persons duty of loyalty such as the duty of non-competition under Section 397, the duty to refrain from using corporate opportunities under Section 397(2), and the duty against self-dealing under Section 398."
적법한 체포에 부수한 휴대폰의 수색과 영장주의 -미연방대법원의 판례를 중심으로-,2016,"['Riley v. California 사건', '디지털 컨텐츠', '프라이버시', '적법한 체포에 부수한 수색', '메타데이터의 수집', '영장주의', 'Riley v.

California 사건 판결에서 지금까지 적용해 오던 적법한 체포에 부수하여 유형적 물체에 대한 영장 없는 수색을 허용하는 선례는 휴대폰에 저장되어 있는 디지털 컨텐츠에 관한 한 이치에 맞지 않는다고 판단하였다. 즉, 위급한 상황과 같은 특수한 상황에서는 특정한 휴대폰에 대한 영장 없는 수색이 정당화된다고 할 것이나 단순히 혐의자를 체포할 당시에 발견된 휴대폰이라는 사실만으로는 그 속에 내장된 디지털 컨텐츠를 영장 없이 수색하는 것은 허용되지 않는다는 입장이다. 그렇다면, 비밀스러운 문자메시지, 이메일, 사진, 은행거래기록, 연락처 목록이나 통화기록 등 방대한 생활영역에서 고도의 프라이버시 이익을 보관하는 휴대폰 컨텐츠의 수색은 위급한 상황이라는 특단의 사정이 없는 한 적법한 체포에 부수한 수색이라도 영장이 필요하다고 보아야 할 것이다. Riley 판결은 경찰관 뿐 아니라 새로운 기술이 문제가 되는 다른 상황에서 프라이버시 보호를 위하여 영장주의의 범위를 획정하려는 법관들에게도 지침을 제공할 것이다. 그런데 휴대폰의 수색과 프라이버시 보호문제의 긴장관계와 관련하여 법원이 이러한 문제를 다루는 데 과연 적합한 조직인가 하는 것이 여전히 의문으로 남는다. 입법부가 입법부는 선결례에 구속될 필요가 없이 기술의 팽창과 변화를 재빨리 반영할 수 있기 때문에 이러한 복잡한 문제의 해결에는 입법부가 보다 효과적인 조직이라는 견해가 많다. 우리 헌법 제12조 제3항은 ""체포·구속·압수 또는 수색을 할 때에는 적법한 절차에 따라 검사의 신청에 의하여 법관이 발부한 영장을 제시하여야 한다. 다만, 현행범인인 경우와 장기 3년 이상의 형에 해당하는 죄를 범하고 도피 또는 증거인멸의 염려가 있을 때에는 사후에 영장을 청구할 수 있다""고 규정하여 압수 또는 수색을 할 때에는 법관이 발부한 영장을 제시하여야 한다고 규정하는 한편 영장주의의 예외를 규정하고 있다. 우리 국회에 계류 중에 있는「국민보호와 공공안전을 위한 테러방지법안」 제16조는 테러통합대응센터의 장으로 하여금 테러단체 구성원이나 테러지원자로 의심할 만한 상당한 이유가 있는 자에 대하여 통신이용 관련 정보를 수집할 수 있도록 하고 있는 바, 이 조항은 일정한 자에 대하여 영장 없이 휴대폰을 포함한 통신 메타데이터의 수집을 허용하는 것에 해당한다. 영장주의와 관련하여 이 법안의 위헌성 여부가 검토될 필요가 있다.","Judging from the type and quantity of information stored on modern cell phones, a search of cell phone means that its owner suffers a significant intrusion on his private life. Considering this point, the U.S. Supreme Court`s recent decision in Riley v. California declared it unreasonable to apply its prior precedent to the digital contents that allows searches of physical objects without a warrant incident to a lawful arrest. Namely, in a particular situation such as exigent circumstances, a warrantless search of suspect`s cell phone can be still justified, however, a law enforcement officer can not search the digital contents of suspect`s cell phone without a warrant for the sole reason that it was found on the suspect at the time of arrest. If so, barring exceptional circumstances, a warrant is essential to the search of suspect`s cell phone storing private text messages, e-mail, pictures, call log, and bank transactions etc., even incident to a lawful arrest. The Riley court`s reasoning is expected to provide a guideline both to the police and the judges who attempt to demarcate the scope of application of the doctrine of warrants. There remains a question that the courts have suitable structures in resolving the strained relations between the government`s interests of law enforcement and individual`s privacy interests. There is a widespread belief that legislative bodies are better equipped entity to treat complex privacy protection problems because they are free from binding force of the precedents and can accept change wholeheartedly. The Constitution of the R.O.K. declares the doctrine of warrants in the provision of article 12 (3). It says that warrants issued by a judge through due procedures upon the request of a prosecutor shall be presented in case of arrest, detention, seizure or search, provided, that in a case where a criminal suspect is an apprehended flagrante delicto, or where there is danger that a person suspected of committing a crime punishable by imprisonment of three years or more may escape or destroy evidence, investigative authorities may request an ex post facto warrant. We have a pending bill in National Assembly allowing the investigative authorities to collect the cell phone metadata of the persons who supply reasonable ground for a doubt of terrorists or sponsors of terrorism. This bill justifies that metadata of cell phone can be collected from innocent people with no limit of period. In this respect, we need to review the tension between the doctrine of warrants and the collection of metadata."

Based on this, I revisit the political aims of Gaewha-dang and present a new perspective on the political situation over the modernizing policy. Yi had smuggled himself into Japan by request of Kim Ok-kyun and Pak Young-hyo in 1879, and made secret contacts with Japanese and western diplomats. Noticed by Kim Hong-jip who was dispatched to Japan as second Su-shin-sa(修信使, a envoy to Japan) in 1880, Yi managed to return home with him, but just after a few months he disappeared. In this article, a close examination was made about the backdoor diplomacy of Yi in Japan and the schemes conspired after his returning home through the unpublished diplomatic documents of Japan and U.K., and the meaning in relation to the political aims of Gaewha-dang was reinterpreted.  The backdoor diplomacy of Yi and Gaewha-dang provide some important implications on their political aims and the domestic situation at that time. First, Gaewha-dang was originally organized as a secret society pursuing grasp of power and the radical reformation of Chosun society by means of foreign forces. Second, in the perspective of the political end, athe secret society Gaewha-dang and the progressive ruling faction must be distinguished. Although the latter pursued modernizing policies to some extent, in that their basic goal was to maintain the status quo of power relations, their position was significantly different from Gaewha-dang. Therefore, the Imo Military Revolt of 1882 should be regarded as the starting point of the serious political struggle between Gaewha-dang and the progressive ruling faction, not the first chance of the disunity within the general progressive group."

Especially in case of the civil penalty, the law is developed by the Korean courts not by the black letter law mostly. Korean Court recognized the validity of the civil penalty in general unlikely to the US courts precedents. However Korean Court alleviated the burden sometimes based upon the Article 103 of Korean Civil Code. If a contractor wants to claim the contract deposit from the guarantor, the warranty events or insured events should occur before. It become an issue when the warranty events or insured events occur. When the legal nature of the contract deposit is a penalty for a breach of a contract, all the contract deposit belongs to the contractor.  In Mergers and Acquisition cases, Contractor’s holdback a.k.a Contractor deposit is used very often to secure the promised procedure of the said acquisition. In this regard, Korean Supreme Court Decision(2012Da65973) decided at 2016. 7. 14. that the legal nature of the Contractor’s holdback can be decided focusing on the essence of it not being determined by the heading of the clause. Basically Supreme Court understood that this is a issue of the interpretation of a contract whether a Contractor’s holdback is a previously fixed amount of damages or a penalty for a breach of a contract. However in this case Supreme Court decided the nature as predetermined damage not a penalty notwithstanding the express wording of the contract which was prepared by the lawyers and full understanding of the meaning partially because of the lack of the due diligence. This may cuase some debates in the context of the M&A."
음악과 감정의 관계 - 嵇康의 「聲無哀樂論」을 중심으로,2016,"['소리', '음악', '감정', '유발', '표현', '음악적인 감정', '조화', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Emotion', 'Arousal', 'Expression', 'Musical Emotion', 'Harmony']","중국의 魏晉 玄學者인 嵇康(224-263, 혹은 223-262)은 이전까지 주류를 이루었 던 『禮記』「樂記」와 판이하게 다른 시각으로 음악-감정 관계를 설명하다. 소리에는 듣기 좋고 나쁜 성질이 있지, 슬픔과 즐거움의 성질은 없다. 혜강은 조화로운 음악 소리 가 듣는 사람들이 저마다 마음속에 감추어져 있던 감정들을 발출하게 하는 작용을 한다 고 본다. 혜강이 조화로운 음악을 구현하기 위한 이상적인 악기로 여기는 琴의 소리는 다른 악기들에 비해 소리가 작기 때문에 조용한 분위기와 고요한 마음이 요구되는데, 이렇게 주변 환경과 연주하고 듣는 사람 마음의 준비 자세를 고려한 것은 혜강 음악론의 신선한 특징 중의 하나이다. 혜강은 또 악기 소리에 따라 심정이 다르게 변하는 것과 마찬가지로 악곡의 곡조에 따라서도 정감이 다르게 변화한다고 보았다. 혜강은 음악에서의 구체적인 감정의 모방이나 재현으로서의 표현을 부정한 것이지 음악의 정서적인 표현 내지는 심미적인 감정의 표현을 부정한 것은 아니다. 혜강은 음악 소리의 셈여림ㆍ높낮이ㆍ빠르기 등에 반응하는 정서들을 자세히 설명하면서도 치우친 감정에 일희일비하지 않고 조화롭고 평화로울 수 있는 음악의 의미ㆍ연주ㆍ감상에 가치 를 두고 음악적인 삶을 추구하다. 음악의 감동은 음악의 아름답고 조화로운 소리로써 마음을 움직여 깊이 숨어 있던 감정들을 안전하게 끄집어내어 직면하게 해주고 그것들을 들여다보고 성찰하여 해소함 으로써 긍정적인 쪽으로 변화할 수 있는 힘을 주는 과정이라고도 할 수 있다. 사람들이 음악에 감동하는 것은 음악이 인간 존재에게 숙명적으로 일어나는 절실한 슬픔을 불러일 으키면서도 그것을 담담하게 받아들이거나 초연하게 극복할 수 있는 생명력과 자유, 그 리고 깊은 즐거움을 주기 때문이다. 이러한 조화로운 감정은 도와 자연과 조화를 이루는 음악적 감정이다. 혜강은 마음의 조화로움과 지극한 즐거움은 음악 소리로 드러나고, 그 음악 소리는 形而上의 근원적인 이치와 결, 조화로운 기운을 담고 있어 듣는 사람의 평온하고 조화로 운 정신을 기르고 이루어낸다고 주장한다. “성무애락”은 사람의 구체적이고 상대적인 감정이 소리와 음악에 재현될 수 없다는 의미이지 인간의 깊고 그윽한 즐거움의 정신이 음악에 표현될 수 없다는 뜻은 아니다. 혜강이 강조한 것은 눈으로 보는 것이 아닌 귀로 듣고 마음으로 듣고 더 나아가 氣로 들을 수 있는 음악적인 감정이다. 그것은 섬세하고 따뜻하고 평화로워 힘든 마음에 위안을 주는 근원적으로 도덕적인 감정이다.","Xi Kang 嵇康(224-263 or 223-262), a scholar belonging to the tradition of the Study of Profound(玄學) during the Wei-Jin(魏晉) period of China, described the relationship between music and emotion from a different perspective from that of the B o o k o f M u si c (Yue ji 樂記). Sound has the property of being good or not good to listen to, but it has neither sorrow nor joy. Xi Kang thought that harmonious musical sounds arouse emotions hidden deeply inside an individual’s heart. The ideal instrument for playing harmonious music for Xi Kang was qin (琴), and qin requires quiet surroundings and a calm mind-set as the sound of qin is not as loud as other instruments. It is an important characteristic of Xi Kang’s music theory that it noted the importance of the surrounding environment and the mind-set of the player or the listener. In addition, just as one’s feelings change according to the sounds of instruments, Xi Kang believed that the emotions also change in response to the tunes of musical pieces. Xi Kang denied the representation or mimesis of specific emotions through music, but did not deny the affective expression or expression of aesthetic emotions through music. Xi Kang pursued the musical life with a focus on the meaning and performance of and listening to harmonious and peaceful music responding to the musical dynamics, pitch, and tempo without being heavily biased towards any particular emotions. Music can be regarded as the process of empowering the individual to make changes in a positive way by moving one’s sentiments using beautiful and harmonious sounds. Music safely guides one to take out emotions hidden inside, retrospect on them, and ultimately resolve them. The reason why people are touched by music is that music arouses the “fatalistic” deep sorrow within them but at the same time offers life, freedom and deep pleasure that help overcome or accept such emotions serenely. The harmonious emotion one reaches through this process is the musical emotion that accords with nature and dao 道. Xi Kang claims that the harmony and deep pleasure of the mind is expressed through music, and the sound of such music cultivates peaceful and harmonious spirit due to its embodiment of li 理(fundamental principle and texture) and harmonious qi 氣. The phrase “sound has neither sorrow nor joy” ( s h e n g w u ai l e 聲無哀樂) says that specific, binary emotions cannot be represented by sound and music, but it does not mean that the deep and profound pleasure cannot be expressed through music. What Xi Kang emphasized was the musical emotion that one cannot see through one’s eyes but can listen to through one’s ears, and mind, and then finally by one’s qi 氣. This kind of emotion is a fundamentally virtuous emotion that is delicate and warm, and is capable of bringing consolation to the fatigued heart."

Methods: This retrospective study focused on progressive keratoconic eyes in Korean patients that underwent accelerated corneal cross-linking from February 2015 to October 2015. Keratoconus was diagnosed in 45 eyes in 30 patients. After accelerated corneal cross-linking with VibeX rapid solution, best corrected visual acuity, maximum keratometry, mean keratometry, corneal thickness, corneal astigmatism, and endothelial cell count were measured at the preoperative visit and post operation 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Results: Best corrected visual acuity (log MAR) was 0.51 ± 0.23 at pre operation and 0.51 ± 0.26 at post operation 6 months, showing no improvement. The maximum keratometry measured with Auto K, Pentacam, and Orbscan II at pre operation was 49.11 ± 4.5 D, 48.37 ± 3.31 D, and 48.98 ± 4.88 D and changed to 49.29 ± 4.34 D, 46.99 ± 3.63 D, and 47.01 ± 3.62 D postoperatively, respectively. Only Pentacam and Orbscan II measurements showed a statistically significant decrease (p 〈 0.05). Corneal thickness (at the thinnest area) was measured with Pentacam and Orbscan II; pre-operative and post-operative 6 month data showed changes from 485 ± 26.27 and 479.24 ± 27.89 to 471.64 ± 27.12 and 472.52 ± 25.36, respectively. Only the Pentacam method resulted in a statistically significant decrease. Endothelial cell count was measured with confocal microscopy and showed a statistically significant difference between pre-operative 2,857 ± 390.49/mm2 and post-operative 6 month 2,639.21 ± 249.92/mm2. Conclusions: This 6-month follow-up study of Korean keratoconus patients who underwent accelerated corneal cross-linking indicates that the method is effective in stabilizing the progression of keratoconus, according to maximum keratometry change.

인도밀교의 성립에 나타난 후기중관파와 밀교의 교섭 고찰,2016,"['후기중관파', '유가행중관파', '소연', '전식득지', '붓다구히야', '『대일경』', '『수습차제』']","인도불교의 성립사를 통해 살펴볼 때 중관사상은 밀교의 성립에 지대한 영향을 끼치고 밀교는 중관사상의 입장에서 석가모니붓다의 연기설을 수행의궤상에 실현시키고 있다. 대승불교의 성립과정은 중관사상을 비롯한 유식, 여래장 등의 대승불교사상이 실천적 목적에 의해 밀교의 의궤를 통해 형식화된 것이다. 특히 용수보살의 중관사상은 이제설의 확립을 통해 세속제의 입장에서 유가행과 더불어 밀교의 의례, 의궤화, 형식화를 설명하는 교학적 근거가 되었다. 중관사상의 발전은 유가유식의 이론적 토대로부터 聞思修慧의 止觀으로 이어지는 수행체계와 결합해 후기중 관파로 일컬어지는 중관학의 세대는 瑜伽行中觀派의 전통을 확립하게 되었다. 대승불교의 방대한 경전과 사상체계를 암기하고, 이를 효과적으로 실현하기 위한 방편은 『유가사지론』의 문지다라니를 비롯한 4종의 다라니 체계와 유가행으로서 지관으로 귀결된다. 『유가사지론』의 지관은 7세기 전후한 시기에 『上禪定品』이나 『金剛手灌頂經』과 같이 진언, 수인 등의 소연상을 관하여 삼매에 이르는 관행으로 발전하였다. 『대일경』의 성립을 통해 眞言門의 용어가 확립되면서 인도 대승불교에 밀교라는 새로운 흐름이 시작되었다. 이 과정에서 인도의 많은 후기중관파, 또는 유가행파의 학장들이 관여하여 밀교의 주석을 남겼고, 이들은 한결같이 顯敎와 密敎의 兼修를 지지하는 입장을 보였다. 유가행을 통한 밀교수행 성립의 평가는 밀교가 외래종교를 모방했다는 오해를 불식시키는 것으로 인도불교문헌의 소연상과 유가행 해석에서도 찾아볼 수 있다.","From the viewpoint of outer presentation of Buddhist rites, the Madhyamaka School and Esoteric Buddhism are regarded to have developed controversial doctrines and practices in the history of Indian Buddhism. However, in fact, the Madhyamaka School had a vital influence on the foundation of Esoteric Buddhism, and Acaryas of Esoteric Buddhism brought the doctrine to realize in the actual rite. It is possible to say that Esoteric Buddhism could not succeed in the history of Indian Buddhism without the devotion of the Madhyamaka School.60) The formation of Esoteric Buddhism firstly began by the adoption of religious elements from ancient religions of India. Among those elements, mantra and dharani contain lots of efficient expedients and tools to help the Dhyana and Samadhi of Buddhist practice, regardless of the religious background. Meanwhile, the practice system of the Madhyamaka School was built on the foundation of Yogacara practices, which were composed of listening and contemplating practices, which afterwards abridged to the practice of Samatha and Vipassana. In the early age of Mahāyana Buddhism, the practice to attain Buddhahood was to read and memorize sacred scriptures, but afterwards it adopted the mantra, dharani, mudra and maṇḍala as a Ālambana (所緣) to help the practice of Yogacara like Samatha and Vipassana. At first the Ālambana meant just a phenomenal externality of a practitioner’s mind, but soon those Ālambana became important elements of Accomplishment found in Buddha’s body of Nirmaṇa-kāya and Saṃbhoga-kāya. So lots of evidence has been found that the advent of Esoteric Buddhism in the history of Indian Buddhism did not originate from the outer Indian religions, but from internal and gradual process of ripening Buddhist expedients suggested by the masters of the Madhyamaka-yogacara School."

Purchasing decision of consumers are limited by their personal economic condition (Tully, Tershfield, and Meyvis 2015). In this situation, consumers feel economic powerlessness which can be defined as a feeling of relative deprivation by one`s personal economic condition. Then, how consumers do differentiated compensation consumption when they feel the economic powerlessness? The purpose of this study is to show how economic powerlessness has different impact on consumers behavior than social powerlessness does. This study also examines how materialism which is closely related to consumer behavior affect consumers` purchasing decisions under economic powerlessness. In order to achieve the purposes of this study, a series of 3 experiments were conducted, As a result of study 1, different from social powerlessness, economic powerlessness does not lead consumers to do compensation consumption with power-symbolic products. Study 2 reveals that consumers have stronger purchasing intentions for necessary goods when they feel economic powerlessness while consumers have stronger purchasing intentions for power-symbolic products when they feel economic confidence. Study 3 reveals that consumers with high materialism show stronger purchasing intentions for power-symbolic products even when consumers feel economic powerlessness. On the contrary, consumers with low materialism show stronger purchasing intentions for meaning-symbolic products when they feel economic powerlessness. This results demonstrates strong impact of materialism on consumers` behavior under economic powerlessness. This study has several significant contributions in that it distinguishes economic powerlessness from social powerlessness and examines how economic powerlessness influences consumers` purchasing behaviors. As economic recession continues, investigating consumer behavior under economic powerless is getting more significant. In this light, this study can play an important role as a basis for future studies in respective research area."
Evaluating and addressing the effects of regression to the mean phenomenon in estimating collision frequencies on urban high collision concentration locations,2016,"['Random noise', 'Safety performance function', 'The regression to the mean', 'Empirical bayes method', 'Continuous risk profile']",,"Two different methods for addressing the regression to the mean phenomenon (RTM) were evaluated using empirical data: 1The Empirical Bayes (EB) method, which combines observed collision data and Safety Performance Functions (SPF) to estimate expected collision frequency of a site. 2Continuous Risk Profile (CRP), which estimates true collision profile constructed after filtering out the noise.  Data from 110 miles of freeway located in California were used to evaluate the performance of the EB and CRP methods in addressing RTM. CRP outperformed the EB method in estimating collision frequencies in selected high collision concentration locations (HCCLs). Findings indicate that the performance of the EB method can be markedly affected when SPF is biased, while the performance of CRP remains much less affected. The CRP method was more effective in addressing RTM."

Optimal random sample size based on Bayesian prediction of exponential lifetime and application to real data,2016,"['Bayesian point predictor', 'Mean squared prediction error', 'Cost function', 'Random sample size']",,"Choosing the sample size is a problem faced by anyone doing a survey of any type. ‘‘What sample size do we need?’’ is one of the most frequently asked questions of statisticians.The answer always starts with ‘‘It depends on...’’. In this paper, we respond to this question by considering two criteria, total cost of experiment and mean squared prediction error in prediction problem. Towards this end, we discuss the problem of Bayesian predicting future observations from an exponential distribution based on an observed sample, when the information sample size is fixed as well as a random variable. Some distributions for the information sample size are considered and then for each case we find the parameter of distribution of the information sample size, such that the point predictor of a future order statistic has minimum mean squared prediction error when the total cost of experiment is bounded. To show the usefulness of our results, we present a simulation study. Finally, we apply our results to some real data sets in life testing."

Moralists were placed in front of Haedongmyeongsinrok and were importantly rated in Gukjomyeongsinrok(『國朝名臣錄』), which listed its items in the order of moral philosophy(道學), service(事業) and allegiance(忠節). Not follow structure of Songmyeongsineonhaengrok, which was organized in the former volume(前集), the latter volume(後集), the sequel to volume(續集), the supplementary volume(外集), Kim Yuk(金堉) faithfully reflected Zhuzi`s intention of compilation of Songmyeongsineonhaengrok in which he deemed highly of moralists by including them separately in the supplementary one. Similarly, narrative style of figure in Gukjomyeongsinrok also was a basic introduction of figure at the first, and descriptive part of one’s achievements and comments about one followed style of Songmyeongsineonhaengrok, which increased reliability and objectivity of records by making notes on sources. While compiling Gukjomyeongsinrok, soon after publishing Haedongmyeongsinrok, Kim Yuk added new figures and divided criteria for appraisal of figure into moral philosophy, service and allegiance more clearly. In comparison with Haedongmyeongsinrok, it contained items about allegiance differently to put more emphasis on it. Especially, his opinion of fidelity(節義) was so high that, in the part of allegiance, he treated heavily the people damaged by the GyeYujeongnan(癸酉靖難, the political change in 1453), Saengyukshin(生六臣, the survived six meritorious individuals), Sayukshin(死六臣, the dead six meritorious individuals) and the Sarim(士林, the literati of Joseon) damaged by Sahwa(士禍, the massacres of literati). Kim Yuk followed faithfully what Zhuzi`s Songmyeongsineonhaengro-k was understood by the Sarim in the 16th century, who considered it as a book clarifying the essentials of moral philosophy and its succession through one’s achievement and doctrinality. And he showed a face of pragmatic statesman with more emphasis of service and allegiance, practical aspects of moral philosophy. It also appeared in that he noticed and published Hyogyeong(『孝經』) and Chunggyeong(『충경』), Confucianism Classics(經學) of the Han-Tang(漢唐), the Sarim in the 16th century did not consider them important. It could be suggested that Kim Yuk reflected his own thoughts of statesman here, who, as a representative pragmatist of Joseon in the first half of the 17th century, organized internal affairs and stabilize the livelihoods of the people after struggling national crises. He placed a higher value on the confucianism focused in its Classics of the Han-Tang and some kinds of poetry and prose of the three masters(三家) in the age of Tang(唐代) than the poetry and prose(詩文) in the moral philosophical style(道學風) or neo-confucianism. It seems that Kim Yuk, a representative statesman in the 17th century, had ideological base of confucianism of Han-Tang, unlike Sarim in the 16th century looking upon the world in terms of morality and idealism of neo-confucianism by Zhuzi."
A Review Article on Green Energy Forecasting,2016,"['Green energy forecasting', 'Wind energy', 'Solar PV generation', 'Statistical method', 'learning method', 'Hybrid method', 'mean absolute percentage error.']",,"Looking at our environmental condition it has become necessary to increase the generation of electricity using green energy sources such as solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, waves of ocean, tides etc. Among these energy types wind energy and solar energy have the great potential for generation of electrical power but at the same time it is important to accurately forecast the green energy generation in advance as they are intermittent in nature, less reliable and location specific. In this paper the focus is given on different forecasting methods of wind energy and solar PV generation. An attempt has been made to bring and evaluate the common methods and the most suitable methods for forecasting of the wind and solar PV."
