Unsupervised Learning for Crowdsourced Indoor Localization in Wireless Networks,2016,,,"<P>Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) location fingerprinting has become a prevalent approach to indoor localization. However, its widespread adoption has been hindered by the need for manual efforts to collect location-labeled fingerprints for the calibration of a localization model. Several semi-supervised learning methods have been applied to reduce such manual efforts by exploiting unlabeled fingerprints, but they still require some amount of labeled fingerprints for initializing the learning process. In this research, in order to obviate the need for location labels or references, we propose a novel unsupervised learning method that calibrates a localization model using unlabeled fingerprints based on a hybrid global-local optimization scheme. The method determines the optimal placement of fingerprint sequences on an indoor map, under the constraint imposed by the inner structure shown on the map such as walls and partitions. An efficient interaction between a global and a local optimization in the hybrid scheme drastically reduces the complexity of the learning task. Experiments carried out in a single-and a multi-story building revealed that the proposed method could successfully build a precise localization model without any location reference or explicit efforts to collect labeled samples.</P>"
비지도 학습 기법을 사용한 RF 위협의 분포 분석,2016,['K-'],,"In this paper, we propose a method to analyze the clusters of RF threats emitting electrical signals based on collected signal variables in integrated electronic warfare environments. We first analyze the signal variables collected by an electronic warfare receiver, and construct a model based on variables showing the properties of threats. To visualize the distribution of RF threats and reversely identify them, we use k-means clustering algorithm and self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm, which are belonging to unsupervised learning techniques. Through the resulting model compiled by k-means clustering and SOM algorithms, the RF threats can be classified into one of the distribution of RF threats. In an experiment, we measure the accuracy of classification results using the algorithms, and verify the resulting model that could be used to visually recognize the distribution of RF threats."
중학교 전환기 학습부진학생을 위한 중재 프로그램의 효과 비교,2016,"['중학교 전환기', '학습부진', '학습동기프로그램', '학습전략프로그램', 'Transitional period of middle school', 'Intervention programs for under-achievement', 'Learning motivation program', 'Learning strategy program']","본 연구는 중학교 전환기 학습부진학생의 학습동기, 학업지연행동, 학업시간, 학업성취에 미치는 학습동기프로그램과 학습전략프로그램의 효과를 비교하기 위해 중학교 1학년 학습부진학생 212명을 6주간 18회기의 학습동기프로그램(72명), 학습전략프로그램(70명), 자율학습(70명)에 참여시켰다. 학습동기프로그램과 학습전략프로그램에 참여한 집단이 자율학습 집단에 비해 전반적으로 높은 향상을 보여 두 프로그램이 학습부진 중재방법으로 효과적임을 확인하였으며, 학습동기프로그램과 학습전략프로그램의 효과는 변인에 따라 달랐다. 학습동기 중 내재동기와 자기효능감, 과학 교과의 학업성취에는 학습전략프로그램이 유의한 효과, 학습동기 중 과제가치와, 학업시간의 증진, 사회 교과의 학업성취에는 학습동기프로그램이 유의한 효과를 각각 보였다. 학업지연행동과 국어 교과의 학업성취에서는 두 프로그램 간에 유의한 효과 차이를 확인하지 못하였다. 이러한 결과는 중학교 전환기 학습부진학생을 위한 중재 프로그램은 교과 혹은 학습자의 문제행동에 따라 차별적으로 접근할 필요성을 시사한다.","The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a learning motivation program and a learning strategy program on the learning motivation, academic procrastination, academic learning time and academic achievement of underachieving students in the transitional period of middle school. The subjects in this study were 212 selected underachievers who were in their first grade in middle school. An experiment was implemented in 18 sessions for six weeks. 72 students participated in a learning motivation program, and a learning strategy program was provided for 70 students. The other 70 students studied on their own. The groups that participated in the learning motivation program and the learning strategy program made better progress than the unsupervised learning group. Therefore the two programs were found to be effective intervention methods for underachievement, and the effects of the programs varied with the variables. The learning strategy program had significant effects on intrinsic motivation, which was a subfactor of learning motivation, and on self-efficacy and science academic achievement. The learning motivation program had significant effects on task value, which was a subfactor of learning motivation, and on academic learning time and social studies academie achievement. There were no significant differences between the effects of the two programs in academic procrastination and language arts academic achievement. This result indicates that intervention programs targeting underachieving students in the transition period into middle school need to take into account the academic subject of the program and perhaps even the types of problematic behaviors exhibited by the participants."
딥러닝의 모형과 응용사례,2016,"['딥러닝', '합성곱신경망', '순환신경망', '오류역전파 알고리즘', 'Deep learning', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'Error backpropagation algorithm']",,"Deep learning model is a kind of neural networks that allows multiple hidden layers. There are various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks. Those have been applied to fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition and bioinformatics where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks. Among those architectures, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are classified as the supervised learning model. And in recent years, those supervised learning models have gained more popularity than unsupervised learning models such as deep belief networks, because supervised learning models have shown fashionable applications in such fields mentioned above.  Deep learning models can be trained with backpropagation algorithm. Backpropagation is an abbreviation for “backward propagation of errors” and a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent. The method calculates the gradient of an error function with respect to all the weights in the network. The gradient is fed to the optimization method which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the error function.  Convolutional neural networks use a special architecture which is particularly well-adapted to classify images. Using this architecture makes convolutional networks fast to train. This, in turn, helps us train deep, muti-layer networks, which are very good at classifying images. These days, deep convolutional networks are used in most neural networks for image recognition. Convolutional neural networks use three basic ideas: local receptive fields, shared weights, and pooling. By local receptive fields, we mean that each neuron in the first(or any) hidden layer will be connected to a small region of the input(or previous layer’s) neurons. Shared weights mean that we’re going to use the same weights and bias for each of the local receptive field. This means that all the neurons in the hidden layer detect exactly the same feature, just at different locations in the input image. In addition to the convolutional layers just described, convolutional neural networks also contain pooling layers. Pooling layers are usually used immediately after convolutional layers. What the pooling layers do is to simplify the information in the output from the convolutional layer. Recent convolutional network architectures have 10 to 20 hidden layers and billions of connections between units. Training deep learning networks has taken weeks several years ago, but thanks to progress in GPU and algorithm enhancement, training time has reduced to several hours.  Neural networks with time-varying behavior are known as recurrent neural networks or RNNs. A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. Early RNN models turned out to be very difficult to train, harder even than deep feedforward networks. The reason is the unstable gradient problem such as vanishing gradient and exploding gradient. The gradient can get smaller and smaller as it is propagated back through layers. This makes learning in early layers extremely slow. The problem actually gets worse in RNNs, since gradients aren’t just propagated backward through layers, they’re propagated backward through time. If the network runs for a long time, that can make the gradient extremely unstable and hard to learn from. It has been possible to incorporate an idea known as long short-term memory units (LSTMs) into RNNs. LSTMs make it much easier to get good results when traini"
시스템 결함 분석을 위한 이벤트 로그 연관성에 관한 연구,2016,"['Correlation Analysis', 'Unsupervised Learning', 'System Fault Detection']",,"To identify the cause of the error and maintain the health of system, an administrator usually analyzes event log data since it contains useful information to infer the cause of the error. However, because today's systems are huge and complex, it is almost impossible for administrators to manually analyze event log files to identify the cause of an error. In particular, as OpenStack, which is being widely used as cloud management system, operates with various service modules being linked to multiple servers, it is hard to access each node and analyze event log messages for each service module in the case of an error. For this, in this paper, we propose a novel message-based log analysis method that enables the administrator to find the cause of an error quickly. Specifically, the proposed method 1) consolidates event log data generated from system level and application service level, 2) clusters the consolidated data based on messages, and 3) analyzes interrelations among message groups in order to promptly identify the cause of a system error. This study has great significance in the following three aspects. First, the root cause of the error can be identified by collecting event logs of both system level and application service level and analyzing interrelations among the logs. Second, administrators do not need to classify messages for training since unsupervised learning of event log messages is applied. Third, using Dynamic Time Warping, an algorithm for measuring similarity of dynamic patterns over time increases accuracy of analysis on patterns generated from distributed system in which time synchronization is not exactly consistent."
딥러닝 기법을 이용한 내일강수 예측,2016,"['딥러닝', '딥 빌리프 네트워크', '강수', '예보', 'Deep learning', 'Deep belief network', 'Precipitation', 'Forecast']","정확한 강수예측을 위해서는 예측인자 선정과 예측방법에 대한 선택이 매우 중요하다. 최근에는 강수예측 방법으로 기계학습 기법이 많이 사용되고 있으며, 그 중에서도 특히 인공신경망을 사용한 강수예측 방법은 좋은 성능을 보였다. 본 논문에서는 딥러닝 기법 중 하나인 DBN(deep belief network)를 이용한 새로운 강수예측 방법을 제안한다.

DBN has an advantage that initial weights are set by unsupervised learning, so this compensates for the defects of artificial neural networks. We used past precipitation, temperature, and the parameters of the sun and moon""s motion as features for forecasting precipitation. The dataset consists of observation data which had been measured for 40 years from AWS in Seoul. Experiments were based on 8-fold cross validation. As a result of estimation, we got probabilities of test dataset, so threshold was used for the decision of precipitation. CSI and Bias were used for indicating the precision of precipitation. Our experimental results showed that DBN performed better than MLP."

Moreover, using dynamically generating massive social data, social user`s real-time reaction analysis tasks is hard to accomplish. In the paper, to capture easily the semantics of massive and informal on-line documents with unsupervised learning mechanism, we design and implement automatic topic extraction systems according to the mass of the words that consists a document. The input data set to the proposed system are generated first, using N-gram algorithm to build multiple words to capture the meaning of the sentences precisely, and Hadoop and Spark (In-memory distributed computing framework) are adopted to run topic model. In the experiment phases, TB level input data are processed for data preprocessing and proposed topic extraction steps are applied. We conclude that the proposed system shows good performance in extracting meaningful topics in time as the intermediate results come from main memories directly instead of an HDD reading."
