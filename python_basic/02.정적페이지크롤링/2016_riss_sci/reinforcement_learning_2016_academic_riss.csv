Path optimization for marine vehicles in ocean currents using reinforcement learning,2016,,,"<P>This study proposes a path planning algorithm for marine vehicles based on machine learning. The algorithm considers the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle and disturbance effects in ocean environments. The movements of marine vehicles are influenced by various physical disturbances in ocean environments, such as wind, waves, and currents. In the present study, the effects of ocean currents are the primary consideration. A kinematic model is used to incorporate the nonholonomic motion characteristics of a marine vehicle, and the reinforcement learning algorithm is used for path optimization to generate a feasible path that can be tracked by the vehicle. The proposed approach determines a near-optimal path that connects the start and goal points with a reasonable computational cost when the map and current field data are provided. To verify the optimality and validity of the proposed algorithm, a set of simulations were performed in simulated and actual ocean current conditions, and their results are presented.</P>"
블렌디드 러닝(Blended Learning)을 위한 대학 교수자의 교수역량 도출,2016,"['블렌디드 러닝', '교수역량', '역량도출', '교수 전문성', 'blended learning', 'teaching competency', 'identifying competencies', 'teaching expertise']",,"In recent years, as the effectiveness and efficiency on teaching are emphasized, many university suggest blended learning, reflecting their characters. However, as of now, the programs supported by instructional reinforcement are almost about using the system to run the blended learning, but it is hard to find the programs to improve their competencies. Therefore, this study aims to figure out what constitutes teaching competency. The teaching competency of the blended learning is extracted from literatures and delphi survey. Specifically, the competency in the teaching preparation consists of instruction design. The competency associated with teaching operation is crucial and necessary in the blended learning. It is made up of eight competencies such as their leadership, facilitation, communication, teaching presence, collective intelligence, digital literature, and creativity, fairness evaluationㆍpositive feedback. Lastly, the attitude of professors constitutes two kinds of abilities containing their respect for students and their passion, which are not directly related to teaching. That is, the total number of eleven competencies and thirty-two infrastructures is made from this process. Therefore, the teaching competency developed in this study offer the information about which parts of it should be strengthened by the instructors to successfully settle down the blended learning. Moreover, the result can allow the instructors to reflect on their teaching, and allow the teams of teaching support to provide proper educational programs according to their level of competencies."
Teaching learning-based optimization for design of cantilever retaining walls,2016,"['cantilever retaining wall', 'reinforced concrete structures', 'Teaching-Learning Based Optimization (TLBO)', 'optimum design']",,"A methodology based on Teaching Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm is proposed for optimum design of reinforced concrete retaining walls. The objective function is to minimize total material cost including concrete and steel per unit length of the retaining walls. The requirements of the American Concrete Institute (ACI 318-05-Building code requirements for structural concrete) are considered for reinforced concrete (RC) design. During the optimization process, totally twenty-nine design constraints composed from stability, flexural moment capacity, shear strength capacity and RC design requirements such as minimum and maximum reinforcement ratio, development length of reinforcement are checked. Comparing to other nature-inspired algorithm, TLBO is a simple algorithm without parameters entered by users and self-adjusting ranges without intervention of users. In numerical examples, a retaining wall taken from the documented researches is optimized and the several effects (backfill slope angle, internal friction angle of retaining soil and surcharge load) on the optimum results are also investigated in the study. As a conclusion, TLBO based methods are feasible."
Ubiquitous testing using tablets: its impact on medical student perceptions of and engagement in learning,2016,"['Educational measurement', 'Multimedia', 'Ubiquitous testing', 'Assessment']",,"Purpose: Ubiquitous testing has the potential to affect medical education by enhancing the authenticity of the assessment using multimedia items. This study explored medical students’ experience with ubiquitous testing and its impact on student learning. Methods: A cohort (n=48) of third-year students at a medical school in South Korea participated in this study. The students were divided into two groups and were given different versions of 10 content-matched items: one in text version (the text group) and the other in multimedia version (the multimedia group). Multimedia items were delivered using tablets. Item response analyses were performed to compare item characteristics between the two versions. Additionally, focus group interviews were held to investigate the students’ experiences of ubiquitous testing. Results: The mean test score was significantly higher in the text group. Item difficulty and discrimination did not differ between text and multimedia items. The participants generally showed positive responses on ubiquitous testing. Still, they felt that the lectures that they had taken in preclinical years did not prepare them enough for this type of assessment and clinical encounters during clerkships were more helpful. To be better prepared, the participants felt that they needed to engage more actively in learning in clinical clerkships and have more access to multimedia learning resources. Conclusion: Ubiquitous testing can positively affect student learning by reinforcing the importance of being able to understand and apply knowledge in clinical contexts, which drives students to engage more actively in learning in clinical settings."

Interactive Human Intention Reading by Learning Hierarchical Behavior Knowledge Networks for Human-Robot Interaction,2016,"['Human intention reading', 'Developmental knowledge about human intention', 'Hierarchical behavior knowledge network', 'Human–robot interaction', 'Reinforcement learning.']",,"For efficient interaction between humans and robots, robots should be able to understand the meaning and intention of human behaviors as well as recognize them.This paper proposes an interactive human intention reading method in which a robot develops its own knowledge about the human intention for an object. A robot needs to understand different human behavior structures for different objects. To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical behavior knowledge network that consists of behavior nodes and directional edges between them. In addition, a human intention reading algorithm that incorporates reinforcement learning is proposed to interactively learn the hierarchical behavior knowledge networks based on context information and human feedback through human behaviors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through play-based experiments between a human and a virtual teddy bear robot with two virtual objects. Experiments with multiple participants are also conducted."

A Movie-Based English Learning and Teaching Model Focusing on the Four Skills of English: With Reference to The Holiday,2016,,,"The aim of this study is to suggest a movie-based English learning and teaching model which can be implemented practically, focusing on the four skills of English, and based on The Holiday. For this purpose, a movie-based teaching model for university students was developed. For listening, various kinds of listening materials were chosen from movie scenes and put into practice. Moreover, two different accents, British and American, are simultaneously employed in each movie scene. For the purpose of enhancing speaking skills, a voice-over technique was applied in this model. In order to reinforce reading skills, the entire movie script was not put into teaching-instead, only the eight most useful scenes were chosen and implemented. For writing, simple and interesting topics were selected in order to give less stress to the students and inspire them to write. The following pedagogical implications were addressed, based on students’ feedback. First, the selection of a suitable movie is a key factor in designing a movie-based teaching model. Second, this model should explicitly aim for language learning and practice. Third, teachers should consider their school curriculum and time constraints. Lastly, teachers should be flexible in choosing and recognizing additional materials according to learners’ English levels and interest."

This is a cross-sectional observational study, conducted among 264 medical students in two groups from November 2010 to November 2012. The first group’s tutors did not receive tutor training; while the second group’s tutors were trained in the PBL process. Each group was divided into high, middle and low achievers based on their end-of-semester exam scores. PBL scores were taken which included written test scores and tutors’ performance test scores. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the two kinds of scores in each group. The correlation coefficient between the written scores and tutors’ scores in group 1 was 0.099 (p<0.001) and for group 2 was 0.305 (p<0.001). The higher correlation coefficient in the group where tutors received the PBL training reinforces the importance of tutor training before their participation in the PBL course."

Especially, this study develops a grammar education’s flipped learning model to get an applying possibility. To establish this purpose, this study estimates a valid methodological direction of grammar teaching-learning by reviewing grammar teaching-learning methods and models. And this study adopts flipped learning as a new teaching-learning paradigm to carry forward those direction. Flipped learning is a ‘flipped’ form of traditional teaching-learning, teaching theories in a classroom and solving assignments at home. So it makes learners to watch a video about theories at home and to perform connected activities in a classroom, it could reinforce application and understanding of theories on a video. It comes from period & educational conditions that developing smart devices and aiming learner centered activities. Ultimately, this study makes a grammar teaching-learning model with transferring flipped learning’s features to grammar education. Flipped learning as a grammar teaching-learning model is re-conceptualized by confirming grammar educational characteristics, examining steps and activities of examination focused and inquiry focused grammar teaching-learning model, and setting up categories of grammar educational activities in a curriculum. As a result, this study suggests a grammar education’s flipped learning model, “watching □ questioning → inquiring/applying/introspect → reinforcing”."

The principles of teaching-learning in flipped learning were applied to the general ADDIE model to design the class; learning materials were developed accordingly. The developed flipped learning materials and class design were verified for their validity using an expert panel`s Delphi method and validity test, in which the validity was verified with 0.75 CVR. The developed flipped learning materials were applied to the theory of science education and the instructional effectiveness was analyzed. The results suggest that the students` motivation to study, interest, and confidence in learning increased; however, their satisfaction in class decreased by 30% as compared to the lecture-type class and their self-confidence in the improvement of their academic achievement was not sufficient. In order for a flipped learning class to be successful, the class should be small in size, which would ensure appropriate teacher-student communication and individualized learning; also, the students` burden of learning should be reduced and accessibility to video materials for pre-class learning should be reinforced."

The study explored implications about ways to reinforce debate learning. For these purposes, questionnaire surveys were made with teachers at different school levels: primary, lower-secondary and upper-secondary schools across the country. The survey shows that most of the teachers agree on the necessity and effect of debate learning. However, they do not use the method as much as they want in class. The teachers have difficulties in preparing, implementing, finishing and evaluating the debate learning. There were many teachers who experience hardship, especially, in preparing and evaluating stages. This resulted in making teachers to take negative or defensive stances in carrying out future debate learning. In the meantime, there seems to be a tendency in high level schools that the less they have educational and learning experiences in debate learning, the more they become passive or negative in doing it. Thus we need to ponder, prepare and find supportive and effective plans to help teachers to better approach debate learning activities while reducing trial and error stages to a minimum but these should be able to boost and reinforce their competency in class. These efforts, in the end, would induce debate learning into daily class routines and make it appropriate in the long term."

Five factors that are counted to affect the view of mathematical learning are (1) confidence, (2) utility, (3) aversion, (4) practical ability, and (5) traditional view of mathematical learning. The factor analyses on third graders and sixth graders each illustrate the features of inter-grade factors. The result also indicates that the factors may vary depending on the traits and circumstances of students surveyed. Third graders are more likely to be positive compared to sixth graders in terms of confidence and practical ability, which calls for implementing 'doing mathematics' and reinforcing the method of mathematical learning in the general educational field."

In spite of some sore points about the Free Learning Semester, it has the potential to transform the current junior high school into a desirable middle school as seen in the Middle School Movement in the USA. For this policy to succeed in the Korean context, it must be charged in the form of specially designated local schools, such as alternative schools taking after the independent Free school or Eftersckole in Denmark. Ireland`s Transition Year also strongly suggests that a limited number of students want an individually prescribed curriculum and career-exploring experience at middle school level. If we can compromise and synthesize the advantages of the three policies of the USA`s Middle School Movement, Denmark`s Eftersckole, and Ireland`s Transition Year, the Free Learning Semester will have authentic power to transform junior high schools into middle schools."

The Power Encounter in Ephesians 6:10-19, especially verse 12 says “For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” Based on this background, Rev. Cho presented two ways about the Power Encounter for the growth of the Church in Korea. Firstly, the prayer of healing represents one of the features of Rev. Cho’s ministry. The saints have been blessed through the prayer of healing after the sermon. Rev. Cho’s ministry fulfilled Jesus’healing commands with absolute faith in the healing events of the Bible which have been achieved through the ages. If people experienced victory in the spiritual warfare against Satan with God’s Power Encounter and saw the healing events of the Holy Spirit through the Pentecostal ministry, it would be easier for them to accept Christianity. Secondly, it is important to strengthen the internal capacity of an ongoing battle for victory. Among those distinctive spiritual warfare principles of Rev. Cho, “the principle of internal reinforcement” is a very important principle to maintain a life of constant victory through internal growth and maturity, inner strengthening of the capacity of Christians. The world is still filled with sins, evil spiritual forces are active and even Christians have the nature of corruption. Saints were armed with his consistent preaching and teaching ministry such as, the righteous through faith on the cross of Jesus Christ who was sent by good God, filled with the Holy Spirit, healing, blessings, the ‘Fivefold Gospel’of eternal life and the ‘Threefold Blessing’of soul, body and everything. Also there was ministry about the new identity, selfportrait, status and the continuous teachings about walking with the Holy Spirit through the Spirituality of Fourth Dimension. The Power Encounter Ministry of Rev. Cho is excellent. His faith has a Biblical background. This is a great example of a well incorporated into the pastoral scene and the mission field. Church growth is a result of the victory in the fight through the Power Encounter. Now South Korea is in a serious situation. Church growth has stopped and Korean church has become a target of criticism from the world. This is the time for missionaries and pastors to start preliminary training of the Power Encounter and learn biblical principles for the healthy growth of Korean church."

First, instructors need to teach the importance of clarifying the genres of an official oral presentation and the ways of signaling them. Second, instructors need to emphasize the teaching of both linguistic and non-linguistic aspects of an oral presentation. In addition, sufficient practice should be seriously undertaken in order to achieve fluency in giving a presentation. Third, instructors should teach the students how to use complementary visual materials in organizing the presentation contents. Lastly, they need to teach crucial concepts and how to select contents to include in a presentation based on their areas of specialization. In so doing, the students will learn the important aspects of a good presentation; identify appropriate contents to include; and demonstrate the official way of presenting orally."

In this regard, the curricula of Joan-Miró elementary school and Finow elementary school are analyzed. Germany maintains a multicultural policy which enables immigrants to maintain their native language and identity and simultaneously integrate them into the German society. In short, maintenance of immigrants' mother tongue and immigrant students' acquisition of the German language is the core of Germany's social integration policy.The National European School in Berlin is a public school established for the sake of an educational environment in which students can not only build up language capacity, but also create a culturally mutual environment for multicultural students. The school's educational objective is mutual culture education which can integrate and maintain the cultural identity and language of multicultural students. Joan-Miró elementary school encourages mutual cultural ability and bilingual ability while preparing students for the future intelligent society, leading their independent life and self-initiated learning. Finow elementary school encourages mutual culture ability, language capacity and directional capability apart from the basic capacities that can reinforce students to become citizens in demand of the future intellectual society.Korean foreign language education needs to be practically diversified as in the case of the Germany's National European school. Also, improvement of educational environment such as students' bilingual ability, students' ability development regarding their individual characteristics, and the capability of mutual culture understanding are issues that should be urgently treated."

This researcher set up the structural model in which the past embodied experiences are selected as the leading variable, diverse institutional channels are regarded as the parameters, and the cultural desires are set as final variables and conducted the analysis utilizing the structural equation. As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that cultural artistic education in the childhood as “embodied experiences” was an important factor that makes it possible to choose diverse institutions related to culture, so this researcher presented that it is important to learn by composing the cultural artistic education in the childhood as general institutionalization. Also, since 3 out of 4 parameters presented as “institutionalized experiences” were the variables that reinforce cultural desires, this researcher presented the importance of diverse institutions and channels, and since experiences of using media had greater effects than any other parameters, this researcher proposed that diverse media to enjoy cultural contents and diverse opportunities to utilize the media should be institutionally reinforced."

Separated class students of the Division of International Studies, Ewha Womans University entered the university through integrated examinations(regular·non-scheduled) but they have characteristics as overseas South Korean learner. They are differentiated from both local learners and foreign learners and they show differences in Korean language ability, in particular, in reading and writing abilities by individual within the same separated class. However, Ewha Womans University operates this separated class with the same teaching materials and curricula as those of other separated classes (local learner) and applies the same evaluation system. However, given the learner characteristics of separated class students of the Division of International Studies, different writing education methods by college and by level are necessary for them.Therefore, in the present study, interviews in writing with major professors of the Division of International Studies as well as interviews with students were conducted. According to the results, the interviewees strongly revealed demands for practical expression ability rather than logical reasoning ability in writing classes for new students. In particular, they emphasized the necessity of basic knowledge to write and read scientific writings while requesting to prepare education methods and evaluation criteria considering level differences among learners.To understand the characteristics of students of the Division of International Studies as overseas South Korean learners and identify differences by level, in the present study, errors in sentence layers were analyzed. The types and frequencies of errors that appeared in the writings of students in the separated class of the Division of International Studies and those of students in other separated classes were compared and according to the results, the students in the separated class of the Division of International Studies particularly showed many errors related to the sentence structures of Korean language (errors in compliance of sentence components and errors in the use of postpositions or endings) as well as errors in writing styles(translation style, colloquial style expression). In addition, the numbers of times errors were compared among students within the separated class of the Division of International Studies and according to the results, differences in sentence constructing ability were large among the students. Therefore, the current class operation method and education method that do not consider the learner characteristics of students of the Division of International Studies and differences in learning ability among the students should be improved. In particular, the contents of education on the aspect of expression skills such as sentence constructing ability and sentence arranging ability should be reinforced. As for the operation of classes, separated classes should be organized considering the characteristics of colleges and differences by level and independent evaluation systems are necessary."

The results of the study shows that among the activities of a learning organization, independent variables in this study, promoting inquiry and dialogue as well as encouraging collaboration and team learning affect burnout. In other words, the dedication of an organization to creating a culture in which various learning approaches are experimented through questioning and giving feedback as well as collaborative learning that can reinforce the effective use of team resources have an impact on reducing emotional exhaustion, which is considered to be at the core of burnout. Plus, these factors reduce impersonalization, which is activated to prevent further emotional exhaustion by dealing with customers, colleagues and jobs in a cold, negative and perfunctory way. In this study, the dimensions of promoting inquiry and dialogue as well as encouraging collaboration and team learning were found to reduce the decline in personal sense of achievement of an employee with a negative assessment of himself or herself derived from a lack of achievement in his or her job. Supervisor trust (integrity, benevolence and ability) had a moderating effect on the relationship between strategic learning leadership and impersonalization/emotional exhaustion. This suggests that the trust of supervisor helps mediate and moderate the emotional exhaustion and impersonalization of organizational members by encouraging leaders to drive change and take the organization to a new direction. The study has provided implications that communication plays an important role in reducing burnout in the learning context such as positive, appreciative inquiry and feedback analysis to identify strength, and that supervisor trust is critical in order to ensure strategic learning leadership exerts greater influence on the organization."

Method: Sixty-two special education teachers of students with learning disabilities in Gyeongsangnam-Do and Ulsan Metropolitan City participated in this study; a survey was used to collect data. Results: First, teachers perceived that the transition education program items suggested were either important or very important, but they evaluated the overall implementation level as average or just slightly above average. Second, in a comparison between the overall level of importance and the effectiveness of implementation of transition education programs, teachers responded that the latter was significantly lower than the former. Third, in terms of difficulties in implementing transition education, teachers pointed towards quite a few factors: a lack of cooperation and support from related agencies and local companies, a dearth of employment opportunities for individuals without disability welfare cards, local companies"" negative attitudes towards employing people with learning disabilities, students"" lack of desire for employment, a lack of facilities and equipment for transition education in schools, and a lack of cooperation from parents. Fourth, concerning major directions for improvement, teachers suggested reinforcement of cooperation and connections with local companies and employment-related agencies, resolution of disadvantages in employment for those without disability welfare cards, employment of transition education specialists in schools, development and implementation of field-centered transition programs, an increase in transition service support centers and transition education special coordinators. Conclusion: It is expected that the government or related agencies will use the results from this study to develop policies to improve transition outcomes for students with learning disabilities."

It is, however, difficult to automate this task because human players interact with dynamic environments in real time. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) method for simulating stealthy movements in dynamic environments, in which an integrated model of Q-learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is exploited as an action classifier. Experiment results show that our simulation agent responds sensitively to dynamic situations and thus is useful for game level designer to determine various parameters for game."

MOOC contents would be used as online teaching materials for blended learning in general universities from now on. Peer assessment is a useful move to obtain the authenticity and pragmaticism of the evaluation facets especially in MOOC. Besides, students will get the high efficiency and positive reinforcement as fulfilling the assessment task using their own Korean writing genre knowledge during the required evaluating progress. For this, we should consider some premises as follow: first, the online course should be organised in different time mandatory system from the off line undergraduate classroom. It will be a reasonable way to produce 6-7 week contents which are organised by total 650 minute instructional materials. Second, students' diligent participation degree should be examined and included in their achievement result. Third, the evaluation process and the rubric acquisition should be part in the on/off line curriculum of the blended learning course, which will be the meaningful experience to the second language learners."

I believe, first, the problem of psychological assumption of feminine masochism is in the fact that it has been spread without sufficient evidences, emerging simply from Deutsch’s theory, and uncritically applied to women and misused within a patriarchal societal norms. Secondly, the psychological assumptions of feminine personality characteristics regarding why women stay in their abusive relationships negatively impact the woman battering issue, because of its misinterpretations and misusages for the revictimization of women in the patriarchal societal norms, not because of psychological theories and assumptions, per se. Thirdly, the learned helplessness theory definitely contributes to the explanation and appreciation of battered women, but may be inevitably criticized in that an attempt to understand the victimization process of battered women can reinforce women’s oversimplified characteristics such as helplessness or passivity in the battering situation. Since the psychological assumptions of women is inherently related to social environments and societal characteristics, they, unintentionally, play their role in leading to prejudiced psychological assumptions and myths about battered women. Such myths and stereotypes about battered women are closely combined with socio-cultural and religious (Christian) norms in patriarchal systems and structures, which often support woman battering.

경영자의 낙관주의적 오류와 비대칭적인 원가행태,2016,"['경영자 낙관주의', '원가의 하방경직성', '영점조절오류', '학습 및 자기본위편향', 'Managerial optimism', 'Cost stickiness', 'Miscalibration', 'Learning and self-attribution bias']",,"With respect to the cause of sticky costs, some streams of the literature focused on the effect of private managerial incentives on cost stickiness. After Anderson et al. (2003) proposed that sticky costs result from the agency problem, Chen et al. (2012) provided empirical evidence that empire-building incentives arising from the agency problem move the sales, general, and administrative (SG&A) cost asymmetry away from its optimal level. Balakrishnan and Gruca (2008), Kama and Weiss (2012), and Dierynck et al. (2012) insisted through case studies that sticky costs are derived from managers` private incentives. Balakrishana et al. (2014) provided related evidence by focusing on short-run managerial incentives. A recently popular stream of the literature (i.e., Banker and Chen, 2006a; Banker and Byzalov, 2013; Banker et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013; Banker et al., 2014) adopted an explanation for managerial expectations, as first noted by Anderson et al. (2003), which stated that SG&A stickiness could intensify during periods of economic growth. Recently, behavioral finance and accounting researchers have become interested in the implications of managerial overconfidence for managers` decision-making. Overconfidence is a well-documented phenomenon in psychology (Allen and Evans, 2005). In particular, managerial overconfidence and optimism has had popular appeal as an explanation for asymmetric cost behavior (e.g., Banker and Chen, 2006a; Banker and Byzalov, 2013; Banker et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013; Banker et al., 2014; Yang, 2015). Banker et al. (2014) explain a complex pattern of sticky costs by combining two opposing processes (cost stickiness conditional on a prior sales increase and cost anti-stickiness conditional on a prior sales decrease) that reflect the structure of optimal decisions and the impact of managers` optimism. Chen et al. (2013) describe that SG&A cost stickiness increases as the degree of managerial overconfidence increases. Yang (2015) describe that optimistic bidder CEOs who overestimate the merged firm`s growth induce greater cost stickiness. This study aims to complement the behavioral accounting literature on the impact of managerial optimistic biases on resource allocation decisions. The primary studies in this area focused on the effect of managerial incentives on sticky costs as a managerial expectation explanation (e.g., Banker and Chen, 2006a; Banker and Byzalov, 2013; Banker et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2013; Banker et al. 2014). In particular, the rapidly growing literature aforementioned (e.g., Chen et al., 2013; Yang, 2015) suggested an overconfidence explanation for sticky costs from the behavioral perspective. In this context, we examine the impact of managerial optimistic bias on sticky cost behavior by using Lin et al. (2005)`s measure as a proxy of the managerial optimism. Hence, the proxy of the managerial optimism employed by Lin et al. (2005) may fail to reflect time interval between forecastingand actual period. To mitigate this problem, we employ the difference between management`- and analyst`s sales forecast as a managerial optimistic bias. Further, we additionally adopt the measure of strong managerial optimism reinforced by learning and self-attribution bias. We first predict that managers who overestimate growth of future sales due to a bias related to miscalibration and the better-than-average effect are more patient with retaining unused capacity when sales decrease than do rational managers. This patience results in greater stickiness of committed costs. For the next stage, we expect that the optimistic managers who experience greater prior performance are more likely to retain unused slack when subsequent future sales decrease, as opposed to the managers who experience lower performance. This may be because successful managers assess the probability of realizing their optimistic expectations of growth more greatly owing to learning and the self-attribution bias. The results show that the cost stickiness in firms with optimistic managers exceeds that of firms with rational managers. Further, the degree of the cost stickiness in firms with optimistic managers grows even stronger with prior better performance. These are also consistent with alternative robust tests. We contribute to several streams of the literature. First, we complement the literature on sticky costs as an explanation for managerial expectation by examining―from an angle other than rational expectation―the effect of managerial optimistic bias that surpasses that of general managers on inelastic cost structure or over-slack resources. Finally, we contribute to the growing body of the behavioral accounting literature by adopting the difference between management`- and analyst`s forecast as a managerial optimistic bias, thus remedying the time interval problem of Lin et al. (2005)`s measure."

It is necessary because the Christian universities should find a way to cope with the university restructuring strongly driven by the government and strengthen educational competitiveness. The evangelical personality education can realize a distinctive and excellent Christian education, which should foster the spirituality incarnating the kingdom of God. The incarnational spirituality education aims at a holistic, integrated education, not restricted to a cognitive learning, but leading to a comprehensive learning - knowing, sharing, and practicing the values of the Gospel while cultivating religious personality and moral character. Nurturing the spirituality purposes to establish a right relationship with God to develop self-esteem, community values, and responsibility for neighbor, society, nature, and the world. It is the incarnational spirituality education to infiltrate the values of the Gospel such as truth, love, and service into the whole personality. It will transform the whole person to forge links with neighbor, local community, and glocal society and help to realize on earth the core value of the kingdom of God, that is, shalom encompassing justice, peace, and love. The incarnational spirituality education can be argued on the theological bases supported by H. Richard Niebuhr’s model of the Gospel transforming culture, Johannes F. Hoekendijk’s idea of missio dei, Theo Sundermeier’s missiological concept of Konvivenz, Thomas H. Groome’s educational theory of conation, and William A. Linton’s ideal of the Christian university. This paper suggests how to practice the incarnational spirituality education, presenting cases and examples of the Christian universities in Korea. The incarnational spirituality education should include first, culture-transforming education correlating faith with learning; secondly, holistic, practical education enabling the whole personality to know, share, practice the values of the Gospel; thirdly, communal and glocal education transcending the self to participate in community and facilitate the realization of shalom in the glocal society; finally but not least, mutual relational education between professors and students through personal meeting and communal life sharing. The success of the alternative evangelical education will rely on the best use of curricular courses, extra-curricular activities, and efficient educational systems that the Christian university will make."

In the context of school violence, most students are bystanders. They can either reinforce the violence or stop the violence. We hypothesized that the students who know their own temperament dimensions such as novelty seeking, harm avoidance, and reward dependence (Cloninger, 1994) will show more tendencies to defend victims from school violence when they learned the methods to prevent school violence in accordance to their temperament dimensions. 351 Korean middle school students participated the 4 sessions of school violence prevention program. The students completed the questionnaires to identify their own behavior in school violence situations. In the experimental group(temperament group), students learned the methods to help the victims that suits with their own temperaments. Whereas, the comparison group just attend the class regardless of their temperaments. Both groups showed significant increase in the trend of defending the victims. However, the temperament group showed more tendency to protect/defend the victims than the comparison group when they faced with school violence. These results show that students can learn the methods of defending victims from school violence more easily by knowing their own temperament dimensions, and can be the prepared and the effective defenders."

For this purpose, aspects of repetition in classroom conversation were examined using classroom conversation structure analysis methodology. The results show that Korean language teachers use key pedagogical themes as conversation topics and through a process of continual repetition of these themes enable the students to continually encounter the target words within the conversation; thereby facilitating the learning of vocabulary. The analysis also indicated that Korean language teachers find ways to relate target words to their students’ experiences and in this way reinforce them through repetition. In addition, this analysis suggests that Korean language teachers employ a dramatization frame in order to repeat words. These dramatization frames can be used to encourage the students' awareness of the target words. Based on the results of this study, it is possible to postulate that the setting of convergent topics is required to control words, thereby enabling their efficient repetition."

In this study, 4 stages of learning prolonged sounds were selected after the three reading elements of prolonged sounds were combined and changed palatalization by prolonged sounds was included in the patterns of reading prolonged sounds.Here, final consonants of ‘ㅇ’ and ‘ㅎ’ which are not associated with making a prolonged sound, were excluded in the elements.And then, a text book of reading prolonged sounds was designed into two directions: one is to reinforce the learning of prolonged sound principles and the other is to structure language material hierarchically to realize the learning of principle. In the composition of a text book, the conditions and reading method of prolonged sounds have to be proposed separately and a variety of repetitive activities has to be arranged so that learners can keep reminding and acquiring the laws of prolonged sounds. To attain the objective, the reading materials of prolonged sounds have to be arranged. In a unit of language material, words have to gradually expand to phrases; phrases to sentences; and sentences to paragraphs. Meanwhile, the basic practice of reading prolonged sounds start with words and a phrase of words. The levels of difficulty were set from ‘easy’ to ‘challenging’, considering such factors as learner’s familarity with language material, number of syllables, and the position and frequency of a prolonged sound in it. It will minimize the cogitative burden of a learner and help them concentrate on reading of prolonged sounds.This study expects this text book to be used in 3 ways for direct applicability in a short term and indirect applicability in a long term. First, it can be used as a supplementary material for a main text book when teaching students. Second, it can be utilized as a guideline to the order of a method of reading it to students.

Effects of Strategy-Based Instruction on Improving EFL Reading Comprehension for Middle School Students,2016,"['strategy-based instruction', 'reading strategies', 'reading comprehension']",,"This paper discusses the application of an eight week strategies-based instruction (SBI) training program conducted in middle school English classes in Korea. The program focused on specific instruction in reading strategies: Identifying key words, topics, and main ideas; previewing and making predictions; and understanding logical organization. This paper examined the impact of strategy use by the participants to improve EFL reading comprehension. Findings revealed that the participants possessed a general understanding of EFL strategy use, and were able to improve their reading skills. However, overall practice of strategy use was limited due to the lack of adherence to effective individualized self-study practices and the restricted in-class opportunities to learn and reinforce applicable strategies. In addition, surveys and interviews identified further limitations associated with time restrictions, student workload, and graded requirements for the university entrance exam. These limitations indicated that the application of strategies was less likely to occur in public education and more acceptable in commercial non-graded academic institutes and private settings. Thus, EFL teachers should promote an awareness of SBI as an effective option while reinforcing the requirements essential to aid reading comprehension."

Secondly, the NI integrated education, seen as middle class-driven educational agenda, was set up as one of national educational sectors in which the whole school running cost should be covered by the national finance and thus was open free to the all children. Thirdly, there are many parents who have become lifelong learners themselves, transforming their communities more peacefully and tolerantly on the way to school creation. As a consequence the role of parents of integrated education movement is to be evaluated as a meaningful contribution of peace process in the divided NI society by becoming lifelong learners for transforming the society. It seemed that they achieved the general goal of lifelong learning for peace and mutual understanding in the community."

Methods: For this survey, 257 students (1st and 2nd year) participated, and it was performed over two weeks in September 2014. In this study, statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 18.0 for Windows and as a t-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis. Results: The students’ academic stress had a significant impact on their depression (β=.279). The moderating effects of academic resilience did not have a significant impact, which is presumably as a result of there being more complex, nonlinear effects, rather than a simple, linear relationship between academic stress and resilience. Conclusion: It may be incorrect to assume that academic resilience is a moderating variable that lessens academic stress. It is implied that academic resilience can have a significant impact when internal and external support conditions are met, and that the effects can be reinforced when family support, a learning environment, and improved adaptability to life at school are also provided."

French educational network system is defined by two functions : One is the inter-school networking system, the second is the multiple educational networking system with various organizations such as city hall-office of education-governmental and non governmental associations. Above all, this inter-school educational networking system promotes constantly school unit`s cooperation as common projects and programs between preschool and elementary school and middle school. In this context, school is considered as an open place for all and has a central function for educational autonomous networking which aims at the consolidation of local educational resources. The French educational networking system`s implications are as following; firstly, building a synthetical educational networking system which combines youth`s overall everyday life with integral welfare youth policy, secondly, revitalizing intra - inter - outside of school`s educational cooperation, thirdly, reinforcing the local education community due to the city development policy and the educational priority policy, and finally promoting the synergy`s effects in terms of inter-ministerial working for other youth policies. The fact that the networking as the key for the success of educational welfare safety could suggest multiple learning points for Korea which has just started to settle the educational networking system with the educational welfare priority plan."

One is the influence of the mega-discourses combined with educational purposes on the interpretation of historical facts, commonly found in East Asia in the discourses focused on nation-states. In Korea, the inclination to nation-state has been maintained as an important frame in history education, continuously impacting history interpretations. A case in point was the issues surrounding the Four Commanderies of the Han in the Korean ancient history. In response to the inclination, discussions on East Asian history started followed by the incorporation of East Asian history into the curriculum. However, it seems that the strong educational motivation within the discussions act as a limitation.  The other is the emphasis on the importance of liberal education from a pragmatic perspective. One of the discontents of history educators about the third version of the curriculum is the new objective called “reinforcement of educational capabilities.” This new target, combined with the goal of reducing the load of learning, has a risk of distorting the process of handing over the knowledge on history. Therefore, the issue of liberal education must be handled in a cautious way.  If the educators and scholars share their perception on the current issues from a broader perspective, and if the educators enhance their understanding on the viewpoints of history education, these efforts will exert positive influences on each other’s research environment. However, it is also important to keep a healthy distance from public opinions, which can be biased due to excessive interest in the current issues."

The reason for gaeban for the civilian officials was to keep their lives and status, and for the kings to protect their favorite civilian officials, as the military officials took power from the coup. However, gaeban was contrary to the consciousness of the people of Goryeo who revered the civilian officials. Therefore, if someone decided on gaeban, he was given a high office to reduce the sense of repulse to converting to the military class. Meanwhile, the military officials did not convert to the civilian class during the military regime.During the Yuan intervention period, gaeban was more active than during the military regime for the following reasons. First, gaeban was taken as a means to reinforce the numbers of military officials by converting the civilian officials to the military ones, after many military officials died from the war against the Mongol. Second, as the kings initiated politics by their close personal attendants, gaeban was exploited for its nature that enabled faster promotion than custom in order to prefer and nurture their personal attendants. Third, as the adoption of Neo-Confucianism established the mood for learning for intellectual righteousness, gaeban was attempted from the military class to the civilian class. As a result, mutual gaeban became active between both classes. However, whereas gaeban from the civilian to the military class required no condition whatsoever, gaeban from the military to the civilian class was possible only by passing state examination or some form of recognition of intellectual capacity. Also, while geaban from the civilian to the military class led to a higher office than before, gaeban from the military to the civilian class resulted in no difference in office rank before and after the change. Therefore, even during the Yuan intervention period, gaeban from the civilian to the military class was more frequent than geaban from the military to the civilian class.In the later period of Goryeo, holding a second office in the civilian and military classes was as active as gaeban. They were applied to different subjects：the high officials, who were able to promote their opinions on state affairs, were allowed to hold a second office in the civilian or military class, and the low officials, who could not offer their views on state affairs, were not allowed to do so. If a high civilian official seeks to be in charge of a military duty, or a high military official attempts to be in charge of a civilian duty, they were encouraged to gaeban. The reason for not allowing the officials below the seventh poom-rank to hold a second office in the civilian or military class was to keep in line with the purpose of the yangban system to focus on one’s own duties and class. In other words, gaeban was implemented for the purpose of applying the division of yangban and separation of the responsibilities minimally on the class in charge of administrative affairs."

For this purpose I first analyzed the coexistent relation between the multicultural perspective which was included in the 2009 revised curriculum(called ``2011 revision period``)as an achievement standard by the government education policy, and the ethnocentrism as the internal perspective which logically conflicted with the multiculturalism. Also I identified that the ethnocentrism which had become the implicit organizing principle of the literature textbooks had to be evaluated critically, preceding the political-societal demands intruded at the stage of developing textbooks. From this argument I was able to expect three major conclusions as follows；1) integration and elimination of the achievement standards of curriculum caused by workload reductions policy makes more difficult to bring out and concrete the content elements for textbook development, 2) over-sophisticating fixation of the learning process in the textbook structure and formation would cause the standardization of teaching approach, and 3) canonism prioritizing the de-contextural and implicit reading attention in selection and arrangement of the literary works would be likely to remain as it was predicted large power outages. These aspects in the government authorized textbooks system were assessed as not having a positive effect or giving a good contribution to exalt the fundamental values like the diversity of literary education. So I proposed in this study an alternative solution that includes overall rearranging achievement standards between the ``Korean language arts`` and ``Literature`` subjects, providing reinforced authorization criteria for textbook diversification, and registering and applying recommended literary works into the curriculum."

The result shows that the means of academic achievement showed no significant difference, but the standard deviation was getting bigger and the proportion of high achieving students was reduced whereas the ratio of low achieving students was increased. In terms of educational context variables, achievement pressures of schools and the teacher supports for students had increased, on the other hand the negative changes were presented in the aspects of the student’s learning attitudes, personality, and delinquency. Concerning the teacher variables, the collaboration between teachers were promoted in tackling the pending issues, while the morale and satisfaction of teachers were declined sharply. Student’s satisfaction on the school education quality had been improved due to the efforts of improving the quality of schooling through the enlargement of differentiated curriculum and reinforcement of creativity, activity, service, while showing the declination of satisfaction on the school life, interpersonal relationship, the self-esteem and internal motivations of students. As a result of the discriminant analysis high morale and enthusiasm of teachers, low teacher-student ratio, high commitment to tasks and internal motivations of students, limited amount of time for use of computer of students were identified as effective variables to discriminate the good school. The policy implications of the study in the enhancing the educational capacities of general high schools were also addressed."

Chinese classic poetry is one of the most effective teaching‐learning materials for achieving the achievement standards of the classical Chinese curriculum. Thus, this study analyzed Chinese classic poems contained in middle school Classical Chinese textbooks. According to the results, Chinese classic poetry texts were mostly quatrains (絶句), the number was quite small, and interpretations of such poems were incomplete. In some of the textbooks, Chinese classic poetry was included merely for variety. Those involved in Chinese classic poetry education need to make more efforts to activate Chinese classic poetry education by examining the theories and practices of Chinese classic poetry education. That is, efforts should be made externally to increase the number of classes of the Classical Chinese curriculum, and internally to maximize the effects of Classical Chinese education through including more masterpieces of Chinese classic poetry. In addition, the effectiveness of teaching‐learning needs to be enhanced. The theories and practices of Chinese classic poetry education may be reinforced when they serve the objective of education in Korea, which is “to guide people to lead a human life and to contribute to the development of a democratic nation and the ideal of co‐prosperity of mankind.”"

초기 중국불교에 나타난 여성의 문해력 - 『比丘尼傳』을 중심으로 -,2016,"['비구니전', '문해력', '보창', '비구니 사원', '니강', 'Biqiuni zhuan(Biographies of Buddhist Nuns)', 'Literacy', 'Pao-chang', 'Bhikkhuni temples', 'Lecture of Bhikkhuni']","중국을 비롯한 동아시아의 전통 문화뿐 아니라 전근대사회에서는 시대와지역을 막론하고 여성의 문자 생활, 여성의 교육은 노골적으로 폄하되었고 여성이 교육을 받는 것에 대해서 부정적인 의견이 피력되었다. 중국의 전통사회에서 이러한 여성적 삶의 특징을 고려해볼 때, 보창이 기록한『비구니전』은 다음과 같은 점을 시사한다.첫째, 357년에서 519년 사이에 활약했던 주로 사회적인 엘리트 출신의 비구니들 65명에 대한 전기에서 보듯이 중국의 비구니 승가는 초기에 주로 사회적인 주도 계층에서 시작되었다. 둘째, 종교수행자로서 필요한 교육과 활동은 초기 중국불교의 비구니에게 이론적으로는 비구들만큼이나 개방되어 있었다. 불교 의례나 수행에 있어서 비구니들을 배제할 수는 없었던 것으로 보이며, 이는당시의 비구니들이 갖는 문해력을 기반으로 한다. 셋째, 『비구니전』에 수록된80% 이상의 비구니들이 문헌을 활용할 수 있었다는 사실은 초기 중국 불교 안에서뿐만 아니라 당시의 중국 사회에서 여성인 비구니들이 자신의 재능을 개발하고 활용하는 데 있어서 자유와 기회를 누릴 수 있었다는 점을 보여준다.그러므로 5~6세기의 여성들이 중국에서 어떤 문자 생활을 영위했는지를 여러 각도에서 조망할 수 있게 해준다는 점에서『비구니전』은 큰 의미를 갖는다. 이를 통해 가정에서 비공식적으로 이루어지는 교육 이외에 여성들의 교육이 이루어진 ‘공간’으로서 불교 사원에 대해서도 고찰해 볼 수 있을 것이다.","Similar to other societies, women in traditional Chinese society have been disadvantaged in terms of education. This has not only affected individual women, but has also had an impact on women′s relationships with the realms of thought and history. For a significant period of time, only a few women from certain classes were educated; a number of talented women had to make every endeavor to prove, to themselves and to others, that they also had the ability to think independently for themselves.The characteristics of women′s lives and education in traditional Chinese society, as suggested in historical documents and other literature, differ slightly depending on the time period. In general, however, their lives were limited to the home, isolated from the decision-making processes in society, and educated only in preparation for their domestic duties.These characteristics of women′s lives in traditional Chinese society clearly suggest the form that women′s education took at the time. From ancient to modern times, women’s education was limited to the homemaking skills required for family life and the virtues needed to maintain the patriarchal family system.As such, the fact that women′s intellectual and affective development was basically sought only as a means to cultivate homemaking skills and womanly virtues in traditional societies is common throughout East Asian traditional societies in different eras. Women′s education allowed women to develop their abilities only insofar as they were related to homemaking, which was perceived to have socially inferior value, and not to develop their intellectual abilities related to the pursuit of theoretical knowledge.What is more, women were made to think of themselves as subjects with relatively inferior abilities. This caused them to consider their subordination to, and dependence on, men as a matter of fact, and thus did not offer them an opportunity to grow as autonomous subjects.From this perspective, in the end, traditional women′s education in East Asia reproduced and reinforced women′s subordinate position. It was far from the kind of education that could enable women to develop their human consciousness as independent individuals who seek self-awareness, dignity, freedom, and happiness.Bhikkhuni temples that women (that is, bhikkhunis) created, handed down, and developed for themselves nevertheless served as places where women learned to write and were able to study in traditional Chinese society. The educational functions of bhikkhuni temples indicate that women had the power to provide themselves with systematic education. This demonstrates the power of women who can create and take charge of influence culture."

The participants of this study were 13 full-time housewives who sent their only child under 36 months to childcare centers, and the data were generated through in-depth interviews. The findings of this study are as follows. In terms of the housewives’ experiences, first, the reasons why they sent their infants to childcare were 1) to have some “me-time”, 2) to escape from the difficulties of child-rearing, 3) to help their infants adjust to childcare centers as a preparation for their reemployment, and 4) since they gained sudden admission from the centers where they put their infants on the waiting list. Second, sending their infants to childcare gave the housewives 1) a feeling of freedom from child-rearing, 2) a feeling of satisfaction from what their infants were learning at the centers, but simultaneously 3) a feeling of guilty about not doing their duties as mothers. Third, during the time when their infants were at childcare centers, the housewives spent their time 1) by doing the housework, 2) by having some “me-time”, 3) by getting useful information on child-rearing, and 4) by preparing for their reemployment. In terms of the housewives’ thoughts, first, the housewives wanted the society 1) to view their childcare use with a more understanding, and 2) to provide more part-time jobs. Second, in terms of policy, the housewives hoped for 1) ensuring the consistency of childcare policy and reinforcing its focus on the key users, 2) enhancing the treatment and quality of childcare teachers, and 3) strengthening publicity and quality of childcare services. These findings imply not only the need for an enhanced focus on quality and consistency of future childcare policies, but also the need for societal understanding and support on the child-rearing of housewives as well as working couples."
