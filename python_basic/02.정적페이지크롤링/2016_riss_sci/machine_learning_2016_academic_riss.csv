Two Machine Learning Models for Mobile Phone Battery Discharge Rate Prediction Based on Usage Patterns,2016,"['Battery Discharge Rate', 'Mobile Battery Usage', 'Multi-Layer Perceptron', 'Prediction Model', 'Support Vector Machine']",,"This research presents the battery discharge rate models for the energy consumption of mobile phone batteries based on machine learning by taking into account three usage patterns of the phone: the standby state, video playing, and web browsing. We present the experimental design methodology for collecting data, preprocessing, model construction, and parameter selections. The data is collected based on the HTC One X hardware platform. We considered various setting factors, such as Bluetooth, brightness, 3G, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Sync. The battery levels for each possible state vector were measured, and then we constructed the battery prediction model using different regression functions based on the collected data. The accuracy of the constructed models using the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the support vector machine (SVM) were compared using varying kernel functions. Various parameters for MLP and SVM were considered. The measurement of prediction efficiency was done by the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). The experiments showed that the MLP with linear regression performs well overall, while the SVM with the polynomial kernel function based on the linear regression gives a low MAE and RMSE. As a result, we were able to demonstrate how to apply the derived model to predict the remaining battery charge."

Machine-learning-based diagnosis of schizophrenia using combined sensor-level and source-level EEG features,2016,"['Schizophrenia', 'Event-related potential (ERP)', 'Machine learning', 'Source-level features', 'Computer-aided diagnosis']",,"Recently, an increasing number of researchers have endeavored to develop practical tools for diagnosing patients with schizophrenia using machine learning techniques applied to EEG biomarkers. Although a number of studies showed that source-level EEG features can potentially be applied to the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia, most studies have used only sensor-level EEG features such as ERP peak amplitude and power spectrum for machine learning-based diagnosis of schizophrenia. In this study, we used both sensor-level and source-level features extracted from EEG signals recorded during an auditory oddball task for the classification of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. EEG signals were recorded from 34 patients with schizophrenia and 34 healthy controls while each subject was asked to attend to oddball tones. Our results demonstrated higher classification accuracy when source-level features were used together with sensor-level features, compared to when only sensor-level features were used. In addition, the selected sensor-level features were mostly found in the frontal area, and the selected source-level features were mostly extracted from the temporal area, which coincide well with the well-known pathological region of cognitive processing in patients with schizophrenia. Our results suggest that our approach would be a promising tool for the computer-aided diagnosis of schizophrenia."
Machine Learning-Based Imaging System for Surface Defect Inspection,2016,"['Defect detection', 'Deep neural networks', 'Machine learning', 'Machine vision']",,"Modern inspection systems based on smart sensor technology like image processing and machine vision have been widely spread into several fields of industry such as process control, manufacturing, and robotics applications in factories. Machine learning for smart sensors is a key element for the visual inspection of parts on a product line that has been manually inspected by people. This paper proposes a method for automatic visual inspection of dirties, scratches, burrs, and wears on surface parts. Imaging analysis with CNN (Convolution Neural Network) of training samples is applied to confirm the defect's existence in the target region of an image. In this paper, we have built and tested several types of deep networks of different depths and layer nodes to select adequate structure for surface defect inspection. A single CNN based network is enough to test several types of defects on textured and non-textured surfaces while conventional machine learning methods are separately applied according to type of each surface. Experiments for surface defects in real images prove the possibility for use of imaging sensors for detection of different types of defects. In terms of energy saving, the experiment result shows that proposed method has several advantages in time and cost saving and shows higher performance than traditional manpower inspection system."
Capturing variation and gradience in identity avoidance: A case of machine learning,2016,"['variation', 'gradience', 'identity avoidance', 'machine learning']",,"This paper makes the point that a grammar appears to be a sum of tendencies, rather than an aggregate of all-or-none instances. That is, the grammar is not formed by an across-the-board law, but teems with variation and gradience. For a case in point, this paper presents the phenomenon of consonant insertion in Korean total reduplication. To see whether this kind of grammar with variation and gradience can be possibly, and eventually humanly, learned, it is simulated using a model of grammar learning. The instantiation of machine learning in this paper shows that a grammar with variation and gradience can indeed be learned."
Machine Learning Based Variation Modeling and Optimization for 3D ICs,2016,"['3D ICs', 'Variation', 'Machine-learning', 'Regression']",,"Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) experience die-to-die variations in addition to the already challenging within-die variations. This adds an additional design complexity and makes variation estimation and full-chip optimization even more challenging. In this paper, we show that the industry standard on-chip variation (AOCV) tables cannot be applied directly to 3D paths that are spanning multiple dies. We develop a new machine learning-based model and methodology for an accurate variation estimation of logic paths in 3D designs. Our model makes use of key parameters extracted from existing GDSII 3D IC design and sign-off simulation database. Thus, it requires no runtime overhead when compared to AOCV analysis while achieving an average accuracy of 90% in variation evaluation. By using our model in a full-chip variation-aware 3D IC physical design flow, we obtain up to 16% improvement in critical path delay under variations, which is verified with detailed Monte Carlo simulations."
An Analogy between Various Machine-learning Techniques for Detecting Construction Materials in Digital Images,2016,"['digital images', 'Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)', 'Radial Basis Function (RBF)', 'Support Vector Machine (SVM)', 'Construction Materials', 'Detection']",,"Digital images and video clips collected at construction jobsites are commonly used for extracting useful information. Exploring new applications for image processing techniques within the area of construction engineering and management is a steady growing field of research. One of the initial steps for various image processing applications is automatically detecting various types of construction materials on construction images. In this paper, the authors conducted a comparison study to evaluate the performance of different machine learning techniques for detection of three common categorists of building materials: Concrete, red brick, and OSB boards. The employed classifiers in this research are: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To achieve this goal, the feature vectors extracted from image blocks are classified to perform a comparison between the efficiency of these methods for building material detection. The results indicate that for all three types of materials, SVM outperformed the other two techniques in terms of accurately detecting the material textures in images. The results also reveals that the common material detection algorithms perform very well in cases of detecting materials with distinct color and appearance (e.g., red brick); while their performance for detecting materials with color and texture variance (e.g., concrete) as well as materials containing similar color and appearance properties with other elements of the scene (e.g., ORB boards) might be less accurate."
Intelligent Traffic Prediction by Multi-sensor Fusion using Multi-threaded Machine Learning,2016,"['Intelligent transportation system', 'K-nearest neighbor', 'Naive bayes']",,"Estimation and analysis of traffic jams plays a vital role in an intelligent transportation system and advances safety in the transportation system as well as mobility and optimization of environmental impact. For these reasons, many researchers currently mainly focus on the brilliant machine learning-based prediction approaches for traffic prediction systems. This paper primarily addresses the analysis and comparison of prediction accuracy between two machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). Based on the fact that optimized estimation accuracy of these methods mainly depends on a large amount of recounted data and that they require much time to compute the same function heuristically for each action, we propose an approach that applies multi-threading to these heuristic methods. It is obvious that the greater the amount of historical data, the more processing time is necessary. For a real-time system, operational response time is vital, and the proposed system also focuses on the time complexity cost as well as computational complexity. It is experimentally confirmed that K-NN does much better than Naïve Bayes, not only in prediction accuracy but also in processing time. Multithreading- based K-NN could compute four times faster than classical K-NN, whereas multithreading - based Naïve Bayes could process only twice as fast as classical Bayes."
Machine Learning Approaches to Corn Yield Estimation Using Satellite Images and Climate Data: A Case of Iowa State,2016,"['Crop Yield', 'Machine Learning', 'Remote Sensing', 'Climate Data']",,"Remote sensing data has been widely used in the estimation of crop yields by employing statistical methods such as regression model. Machine learning, which is an efficient empirical method for classification and prediction, is another approach to crop yield estimation. This paper described the corn yield estimation in Iowa State using four machine learning approaches such as SVM (Support Vector Machine), RF (Random Forest), ERT (Extremely Randomized Trees) and DL (Deep Learning). Also, comparisons of the validation statistics among them were presented. To examine the seasonal sensitivities of the corn yields, three period groups were set up: (1) MJJAS (May to September), (2) JA (July and August) and (3) OC (optimal combination of month). In overall, the DL method showed the highest accuracies in terms of the correlation coefficient for the three period groups. The accuracies were relatively favorable in the OC group, which indicates the optimal combination of month can be significant in statistical modeling of crop yields. The differences between our predictions and USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) statistics were about 6-8 %, which shows the machine learning approaches can be a viable option for crop yield modeling. In particular, the DL showed more stable results by overcoming the overfitting problem of generic machine learning methods."

In Wavelet Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (WK-ELM) structure, there are three adjustable parameters of wavelet kernel. These parameters and the numbers of hidden neurons play a major role in the performance of ELM. Therefore, values of these parameters and numbers of hidden neurons should be tuned carefully based on the solved problem. In this study, the optimum values of these parameters and the numbers of hidden neurons of ELM were obtained by using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The performance of proposed GA-WK-ELM method is evaluated using statical methods such as classification accuracy, sensitivityand specivity analysis and ROC curves. The results of the proposed GA-WK-ELM method are compared with the results of the previous hepatitis disease studies using same database as well as different database. When previous studies are investigated, it is clearly seen that the high classification accuracies have been obtained in case of reducing the feature vector to low dimension. However, proposed GA-WK-ELM method gives satisfactory results without reducing the feature vector. The calculated highest classification accuracy of proposed GA-WK-ELM method is found as 96.642 %."

Extreme Learning Machine Approach for Real Time Voltage Stability Monitoring in a Smart Grid System using Synchronized Phasor Measurements,2016,"['Extreme learning machine', 'Loading margin', 'Voltage stability assessment', 'Phasor measurement unit']",,"Online voltage stability monitoring using real-time measurements is one of the most important tasks in a smart grid system to maintain the grid stability. Loading margin is a good indicator for assessing the voltage stability level. This paper presents an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) approach for estimation of voltage stability level under credible contingencies using real-time measurements from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). PMUs enable a much higher data sampling rate and provide synchronized measurements of real-time phasors of voltages and currents. Depth First (DF) algorithm is used for optimally placing the PMUs. To make the ELM approach applicable for a large scale power system problem, Mutual information (MI)-based feature selection is proposed to achieve the dimensionality reduction. MI-based feature selection reduces the number of network input features which reduces the network training time and improves the generalization capability. Voltage magnitudes and phase angles received from PMUs are fed as inputs to the ELM model. IEEE 30-bus test system is considered for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for estimating the voltage stability level under various loading conditions considering single line contingencies. Simulation results validate the suitability of the technique for fast and accurate online voltage stability assessment using PMU data."

Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms for Class-Imbalanced Process Fault Detection Problems,2016,,,"<P>In recent years, the semiconductor manufacturing industry has recognized class imbalance as a major impediment to the development of high-performance fault detection (FD) models. Class imbalance refers to skews in class distribution in which normal wafer samples are considerably more abundant than fault samples. In such a situation, standard machine learning algorithms create FD models with classification boundaries that are biased toward majority-class data, resulting in high type II error rates. In this paper, we compare the performance of machine learning algorithms for class-imbalanced FD problems. We evaluate the performance of three sampling-based algorithms, four ensemble algorithms, four instance-based algorithms, and two support vector machine algorithms. Two experiments were conducted to compare algorithm performance using etching process data and chemical vapor deposition process data. Different data scenarios were considered by setting the imbalance ratio to three levels. The results of the experiments indicated that the instance-based algorithms presented excellent performance even when the imbalance ratio increased.</P>"

These catastrophic, gravity-driven processes cost the government several billion KRW (South Korean Won) in losses in addition to fatalities every year. The most common type of landslide observed is the shallow landslide, which occurs at 1-3 m depth, and may mobilize into more catastrophic flow-type landslides. Hence, to predict potential landslide areas, susceptibility maps are developed in a geographical information system (GIS) environment utilizing available morphological, hydrological, geotechnical, and geological data. Landslide susceptibility models were developed using 163 landslide points and an equal number of nonlandslide points in Mt. Woomyeon, Seoul, and 23 landslide conditioning factors. However, because not all of the factors contribute to the determination of the spatial probability for landslide initiation, and a simple filter or wrapper-based approach is not efficient in identifying all of the relevant features, a feedback-loop-based hybrid algorithm was implemented in conjunction with a learning scheme called an extreme learning machine, which is based on a single-layer, feed-forward network Validation of the constructed susceptibility model was conducted using a testing set of landslide inventory data through a prediction rate curve. The model selected 13 relevant conditioning factors out of the initial 23; and the resulting susceptibility map shows a success rate of 85% and a prediction rate of 89.45%, indicating a good performance, in contrast to the low success and prediction rate of 69.19% and 56.19%, respectively, as obtained using a wrapper technique.

Downscaling of AMSR-E soil moisture with MODIS products using machine learning approaches,2016,,,"<P>Passive microwave remotely sensed soil moisture products, such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) data, have been routinely used to monitor global soil moisture patterns. However, they are often limited in their ability to provide reliable spatial distribution data for soil moisture due to their coarse spatial resolutions. In this study, three machine learning approaches-random forest, boosted regression trees, and Cubist-were examined for the downscaling of AMSR-E soil moisture (25 9 25 km) data over two regions (South Korea and Australia) with different climatic characteristics using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products (1 km), including surface albedo, land surface temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, Leaf Area Index, and evapotranspiration (ET). Results showed that the random forest approach was superior to the other machine learning models for downscaling AMSR-E soil moisture data in terms of the correlation coefficient [r = 0.71/0.84 (South Korea/Australia) for random forest, 0.75/0.77 for boosted regression trees, and 0.70/0.61 for Cubist] and root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.049/0.057, 0.052/0.078, and 0.051/0.063, respectively) through cross-validation. The ET and LST were identified as the most influential among the six input parameters when estimating AMSR-E soil moisture for South Korea, while ET, albedo, and LST were very useful for Australia. In overall, the downscaled soil moisture with 1 km resolution yielded a higher correlation with in situ observations than the original AMSR-E soil moisture data. The latter appeared higher than the downscaled data in forested areas, possibly due to the overestimation of soil moisture by passive microwave sensors over forests, which implies that downscaling can mitigate such overestimation of soil moisture.</P>"
Intraoperative Diagnosis Support Tool for Serous Ovarian Tumors Based on Microarray Data Using Multicategory Machine Learning :,2016,,,"<P>Objectives Serous borderline ovarian tumors (SBOTs) are a subtype of serous ovarian carcinoma with atypical proliferation. Frozen-section diagnosis has been used as an intraoperative diagnosis tool in supporting the fertility-sparing surgery by diagnosing SBOTs with accuracy of 48% to 79%. Using DNA microarray technology, we designed multicategory classification models to support frozen-section diagnosis within 30 minutes. Materials and Methods We systematically evaluated 6 machine learning algorithms and 3 feature selection methods using 5-fold cross-validation and a grid search on microarray data obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. To validate the models and selected biomarkers, expression profiles were analyzed in tissue samples obtained from the Yonsei University College of Medicine. Results The best accuracy of the optimal machine learning model was 97.3%. In addition, 5 features, including the expression of the putative biomarkers SNTN and AOX1, were selected to differentiate between normal, SBOT, and serous ovarian carcinoma groups. Different expression levels of SNTN and AOX1 were validated by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. A multinomial logistic regression model using SNTN and AOX1 alone was used to construct a simple-to-use equation that gave a diagnostic test accuracy of 91.9%. Conclusions We identified 2 biomarkers, SNTN and AOX1, that are likely involved in the pathogenesis and progression of ovarian tumors. An accurate diagnosis of ovarian tumor subclasses by application of the equation in conjunction with expression analysis of SNTN and AOX1 would offer a new accurate diagnosis tool in conjunction with frozen-section diagnosis within 30 minutes.</P>"

A Dynamic Channel Switching Policy Through P-learning for Wireless Mesh Networks,2016,"['Dynamic channel switching', 'machine learning', 'switching delay', 'WMN']",,"Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) based on IEEE 802.11s have emerged as one of the prominent technologies in multi-hop communications. However, the deployment of WMNs suffers from serious interference problem which severely limits the system capacity. Using multiple radios for each mesh router over multiple channels, the interference can be reduced and improve system capacity. Nevertheless, interference cannot be completely eliminated due to the limited number of available channels. An effective approach to mitigate interference is to apply dynamic channel switching (DCS) in WMNs. Conventional DCS schemes trigger channel switching if interference is detected or exceeds a predefined threshold which might cause unnecessary channel switching and long protocol overheads. In this paper, a P-learning based dynamic switching algorithm known as learning automaton (LA)-based DCS algorithm is proposed. Initially, an optimal channel for communicating node pairs is determined through the learning process. Then, a novel switching metric is introduced in our LA-based DCS algorithm to avoid unnecessary initialization of channel switching. Hence, the proposed LA-based DCS algorithm enables each pair of communicating mesh nodes to communicate over the least loaded channels and consequently improve network performance."
Active learning using transductive sparse Bayesian regression,2016,"['Active learning', 'Sparse Bayesian regression', 'Transductive learning', 'Relevance vector']",,"<P>Active learning, one of large and important branches in machine learning and data mining, aims to build an accurate learning model with a relatively small number of labeled points which are chosen actively by the constructed learning model. Active learning algorithms can play an important role when the cost of obtaining labels of data points is expensive. However, the active learning algorithms for the relevance vector machine regression, one of the famous kernel methods for the regression due to its sparseness, Bayesian characteristics, and kernel properties, have not been established yet, whilst those for other kernel methods are extensively developed. In this paper, we propose a transductive relevance vector machine to construct the active learning algorithm for relevance vector machine based a sparse Bayesian kernel regression model. The proposed method obtains its basis vectors from the unlabeled data set as well as the labeled one. Then, we also suggest three querying strategies which uses only the relevance vectors automatically selected by the developed model for active selection for data points to be labeled. Applied to several artificial and real data sets, the proposed method show significantly more accurate results than the benchmark, the random selection, while maintaining the sparse characteristic of the traditional relevance vector machines.

Path optimization for marine vehicles in ocean currents using reinforcement learning,2016,,,"<P>This study proposes a path planning algorithm for marine vehicles based on machine learning. The algorithm considers the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle and disturbance effects in ocean environments. The movements of marine vehicles are influenced by various physical disturbances in ocean environments, such as wind, waves, and currents.

A kinematic model is used to incorporate the nonholonomic motion characteristics of a marine vehicle, and the reinforcement learning algorithm is used for path optimization to generate a feasible path that can be tracked by the vehicle. The proposed approach determines a near-optimal path that connects the start and goal points with a reasonable computational cost when the map and current field data are provided.

Methods: SMILE has been implemented in a diverse set of collective inquiry generation and analysis scenarios including community health care-specific professional development sessions and community-based participatory action research projects. In each scenario, participants are given opportunities to construct inquiries around physical and emotional health-related phenomena in their own community. Results: Participants formulated inquiries as well as potential clinical treatments and hypothetical scenarios to address health concerns or clarify misunderstandings or misdiagnoses often found in their community practices. From medical universities to rural village health promotion organizations, all participatory inquiries and potential solutions can be collected and analyzed. The inquiry and solution sets represent an evaluation vector which helps educators better understand community health issues at a much deeper level. Conclusions: SMILE helps collect problems that are most important and central to their community health concerns. The evaluation vector, consisting participatory and collective inquiries and potential solutions, helps the researchers assess the participants’ level of understanding on issues around health concerns and practices while helping the community adequately formulate follow-up action plans. The method used in SMILE requires much further enhancement with machine learning and advanced data visualization."

Support vector machine based fault detection approach for RFT-30 cyclotron,2016,"['Cyclotron', 'Fault detection', 'Support vector machine', 'Principal component analysis']",,"An RFT-30 is a 30MeV cyclotron used for radioisotope applications and radiopharmaceutical researches. The RFT-30 cyclotron is highly complex and includes many signals for control and monitoring of the system. It is quite difficult to detect and monitor the system failure in real time. Moreover, continuous monitoring of the system is hard and time-consuming work for human operators. In this paper, we propose a support vector machine (SVM) based fault detection approach for the RFT-30 cyclotron. The proposed approach performs SVM learning with training samples to construct the classification model. To compensate the system complexity due to the large-scale accelerator, we utilize the principal component analysis (PCA) for transformation of the original data. After training procedure, the proposed approach detects the system faults in real time. We analyzed the performance of the proposed approach utilizing the experimental data of the RFT-30 cyclotron. The performance results show that the proposed SVM approach can provide an efficient way to control the cyclotron system."

First, the proposed method predicts whether the speech packet to be transmitted is lost. To this end, the proposed method learns the pattern of packet losses in the IP network, and then predicts the loss of the packet to be transmitted over that IP network. The proposed method classifies the speech signal into different classes of silence, unvoiced, speech onset, or voiced frame. Based on the results of packet loss prediction and speech classification, the proposed method determines the proper amount and bitrate of redundant speech data (RSD) that are sent with primary speech data (PSD) in order to assist the speech decoder to restore the speech signals of lost packets.Specifically, when a packet is predicted to be lost, the amount and bitrate of the RSD must be increased through a reduction in the bitrate of the PSD. The effectiveness of the proposed method for learning the packet loss pattern and assigning a different speech coding rate is then demonstrated using a support vector machine and adaptive multirate-narrowband, respectively. The results show that as compared with conventional methods that restore lost speech signals, the proposed method remarkably improves the perceived speech quality of an SW-based MCU under various packet loss conditions in an IP network."

Relationship Induced Multi-Template Learning for Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment,2016,,,"<P>As shown in the literature, methods based on multiple templates usually achieve better performance, compared with those using only a single template for processing medical images. However, most existing multi-template based methods simply average or concatenate multiple sets of features extracted from different templates, which potentially ignores important structural information contained in the multi-template data. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel relationship induced multi-template learning method for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), by explicitly modeling structural information in the multi-template data. Specifically, we first nonlinearly register each brain's magnetic resonance (MR) image separately onto multiple pre-selected templates, and then extract multiple sets of features for this MR image. Next, we develop a novel feature selection algorithm by introducing two regularization terms to model the relationships among templates and among individual subjects. Using these selected features corresponding to multiple templates, we then construct multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Finally, an ensemble classification is used to combine outputs of all SVM classifiers, for achieving the final result. We evaluate our proposed method on 459 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 97 AD patients, 128 normal controls (NC), 117 progressive MCI (pMCI) patients, and 117 stable MCI (sMCI) patients. The experimental results demonstrate promising classification performance, compared with several state-of-the-art methods for multi-template based AD/MCI classification.</P>"

In conclusion, the overall correction rates were 94.5% and 88.84% in SVM and K-means clustering respectively, which means that SVM have more advantage than K-means method for classification of sitting posture."

Most manufacturing companies purchase raw materials or components from other companies, so called, suppliers. A company usually can choose one or some suppliers out of all qualified suppliers. Since the quality of the product is directly related with the suppliers, the supplier selection is an important problem in the supply chain management. Selecting suppliers consists of three main steps: definition of criteria, selection of qualified suppliers, and selection of final suppliers. The first step is to define the factors to evaluate suppliers, which is up to the policy of the company. The second step is a classification problem that selects the qualified suppliers from all eligible suppliers. The last step is to allocate order quantities to the final suppliers out of qualified suppliers. This paper focuses on the second step of the classification problem. We apply data mining methods for the classifying the suppliers, compare the performances, and analyze the results. In particular, when the data is not balanced, the performance of support vector machine shows low performance."

Although a previous study employing a fixed inter-trial interval (ITI) in a cognitive task successfully predicted errors, it is unlikely to generalize from the previous results to other situations. The current study sought to predict errors by reaction times, task conditions, and ITIs extracted from six consecutive trials preceding error trials, in the context of machine learning. The results showed that various types of errors could be observed and predicted. Especially, presence of repeated patterns or time-pressure chances in the ITI trends might be related to errors. This is interpreted that ITI variation is important to predict errors as well as related to participants’ mental states affecting errors. Therefore, this study suggests that various types of errors in a variety of situations can be predicted, in which those errors would be caused by various factors."

This paper applied the learning effect to the repeated activities in a small sized apartment construction project. The result showed that there was about 10 percent of difference in duration (one approach of the total duration with learning effects in 41 days while the other without learning effect in 36.5 days). To make the comparison between the two approaches, a large number of BIM based computer simulations were generated and useful patterns were recognized using machine learning algorithm named Decision Tree (See5).

Through a human subject research, patients-reported BS symptoms data were acquired. Next, experts decisions of 5 Korean medicine doctor were also acquired, and supervised learning models were developed using multiple logistic regression and decision tree. Results : Integrated BS questionnaire with 24 items was developed. Multiple logistic regression models with accuracy of 0.92(male) and 0.95(female) validated by 10-folds cross-validation were constructed. By decision tree modeling methods, male model with 8 decision node and female model with 6 decision node were made. In the both models, symptoms of ‘recent physical trauma’, ‘chest pain’, ‘numbness’, and ‘menstrual disorder(female only)’ were considered as important factors. Conclusions : Because machine learning, especially supervised learning, can reveal and suggest important or essential factors among the very various symptoms making up a pattern identification, it can be a very useful tool in researching diagnostics of TKM.

As an alternative model, conventional hidden Markov model (HMM) and modified hidden Markov model (mHMM) are used where additional information of transition probability between primary properties is incorporated in the predictions. In the comparisons, 16 boreholes consisted with four different materials are synthesized, which show directional non-stationarity in upward and downward directions. Futhermore, two types of the secondary information that is statistically related to each material are generated. From the comparative analysis with various case studies, the accuracies of the techniques become degenerated with inclusion of additive errors and small amount of the training data. For HMM predictions, the conventional HMM shows the similar accuracies with the models that does not relies on transition probability. However, the mHMM consistently shows the highest prediction accuracy among the test cases, which can be attributed to the consideration of geological nature in the training of the model."

In order to effectively manage such problems especially in coastal ocean, water quality should be monitored. As there are many factors that influence water quality, the Korean Government proposed an integrated Water Quality Index (WQI) based on in situmeasurements of ocean parameters(bottom dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a concentration, secchi disk depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus) by ocean division identified based on their ecological characteristics. Field-measured WQI, however, does not provide spatial continuity over vast areas. Satellite remote sensing can be an alternative for identifying WQI for surface water. In this study, two schemes were examined to estimate coastal WQI around Korea peninsula using in situ measurements data and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite imagery from 2011 to 2013 based on machine learning approaches. Scheme 1 calculates WQI using estimated water quality-related factors using GOCI reflectance data, and scheme 2 estimates WQI using GOCI band reflectance data and basic products(chlorophyll-a, suspended sediment, colored dissolved organic matter). Three machine learning approaches including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and a modified regression tree(Cubist) were used. Results show that estimation of secchi disk depth produced the highest accuracy among the ocean parameters, and RF performed best regardless of water quality-related factors. However, the accuracy of WQI from scheme 1 was lower than that from scheme 2 due to the estimation errors inherent from water quality-related factors and the uncertainty of bottom dissolved oxygen. In overall, scheme 2 appears more appropriate for estimating WQI for surface water in coastal areas and chlorophyll-a concentration was identified the most contributing factor to the estimation of WQI."

But Korean semantic role labeling has faced on difficulty due to its different language structure compared to English, which makes it very hard to use appropriate approaches developed so far. That means that methods proposed so far could not show a satisfied perfor-mance, compared to English and Chinese. To complement these problems, we focus on suffix information analysis, such as josa (case suffix) and eomi (verbal ending) analysis. Korean lan-guage is one of the agglutinative languages, such as Japanese, which have well defined suffix structure in their words. The agglutinative languages could have free word order due to its de-veloped suffix structure. Also arguments with a single morpheme are then labeled with statistics. In addition, machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Condi-tional Random Fields (CRF) are used to model SRL problem on arguments that are not labeled at the suffix analysis phase. The proposed method is intended to reduce the range of argument instances to which machine learning approaches should be applied, resulting in uncertain and inaccurate role labeling. In experiments, we use 15,224 arguments and we are able to obtain approximately 83.24% f1-score, increased about 4.85% points compared to the state-of-the-art Korean SRL research."

It, therefore, is very important to lower the total execution time of the simulation especially when that simulation makes a huge number of repetitions with varying values of input parameters. In this paper we develop a simulation service system that provides the ability to predict the result of the requested simulation without actual execution for that simulation: by recording and then returning previously obtained or predicted results of that simulation. To achieve the goal of avoiding repetitive simulation, the system provides two main functionalities: (1) storing simulation-result records into database and (2) predicting from the database the result of a requested simulation using statistical machine learning techniques. In our experiments we evaluate the prediction performance of the system using real airfoil simulation result data. Our system on average showed a very low error rate at a minimum of 0.9% for a certain output variable. Using the system any user can receive the predicted outcome of her simulation promptly without actually running it, which would otherwise impose a heavy burden on computing and storage resources."

The results of the empirical study identify several levels of firms’ learning capabilities and activities such as a) stock of technology, b) potential of technical labor, c) explicit technological efforts, d) readiness to learn, e) top management support, f) a formal technological learning system, g) high learning motivation, h) appropriate technology choice, and i) specific goal setting. These learning capabilities determine firms’ learning performance, especially in the early stages of development. Furthermore, it is found that the critical factors for successful technological learning vary along the stages of technology development. Throughout the statistical and policy analyses, this study confirms that technological learning can be understood as an intrinsic principle of the technology development process. Firms perform proactive and creative learning in the late stages, while reactive and imitative learning prevails in the early stages. In addition, this study identifies the driving forces or facilitating factors enhancing innovation performance in the post catch-up era. The results of the preliminary case studies and policy analysis show some facilitating factors such as a) the strategic intent of the CEO and corporate culture, b) leadership and change agents, c) design principles and routines, d) ecosystem and collaboration with partners, and e) intensive R&D investment."

The machine-part grouping with alternative process plans means to form machine-part groupings in which a part may be processed not only by a specific process but by many alternative processes. For this problem, this study presents an algorithm based on self organizing neural networks, so called SOM (Self Organizing feature Map). The SOM, a special type of neural networks is an intelligent tool for grouping machines and parts in group formation problem of the machine and part. SOM can learn from complex, multi-dimensional data and transform them into visually decipherable clusters. In the proposed algorithm, output layer in SOM network had been set as one-dimensional structure and the number of output node has been set sufficiently large in order to spread out the input vectors in the order of similarity. In the first stage of the proposed algorithm, SOM has been applied twice to form an initial machine-process group. In the second stage, grouping efficacy is considered to transform the initial machine-process group into a final machine-process group and a final machine-part group. The proposed algorithm was tested on well-known machine-part grouping problems with alternative process plans. The results of this computational study demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm can be easily applied to the group formation problem compared to other meta-heuristic based algorithms. In addition, it can be used to solve large-scale group formation problems."
RHIPE 플랫폼에서 빅데이터 로지스틱 회귀를 위한 학습 알고리즘,2016,,,"Machine learning becomes increasingly important in the big data era. Logistic regression is a type of classification in machine leaning, and has been widely used in various fields, including medicine, economics, marketing, and social sciences. Rhipe that integrates R and Hadoop environment, has not been discussed by many researchers owing to the difficulty of its installation and MapReduce implementation. In this paper, we present the MapReduce implementation of Gradient Descent algorithm and Newton-Raphson algorithm for logistic regression using Rhipe. The Newton-Raphson algorithm does not require a learning rate, while Gradient Descent algorithm needs to manually pick a learning rate. We choose the learning rate by performing the mixed procedure of grid search and binary search for processing big data efficiently. In the performance study, our Newton-Raphson algorithm outpeforms Gradient Descent algorithm in all the tested data."

Artificial intelligence is based on the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized. The Beginning of artificial intelligence is set in 1956. Watson, the artificial intelligence program created by I. B. M. is able to understand natural language queries and answer question. Machine Learning is the hot new phase of artificial intelligence. This has become practical only recently with the development of big data. Applying machine learning is a big switch from traditional police dispatching.The use of artificial intelligence to predict crime has only recently emerged. For example Predpol software is a powerful tool that allows law enforcement to shift from reactive to preventive policing. It’s algorithm uses advanced mathematics and machine learning to generate predictions using type, place, and time of past crimes. It is based on the idea that analyzing large amount of crime data, you can more accurately predict where and when crimes may happen.This article reviews the admissibility of predictive policing based on artificial intelligence. The standard rule on admissibility of new scientific evidence is Frye and Daubert test. But the reliability of machine learning should be differently assessed. The heart of machine learning is artificial neural network. Artificial neural network can learn, but acts as a black box. So artificial neural network can’t explain how it arrives at a particular solution. This opaqueness affects the admissibility of crime prediction based on machine learning. If we cannot see how the network derives its results it produces, we cannot accept the results. The validation of results is very important factor in admissibility of scientific evidence in criminal trials. But predictive policing based on artificial intelligence will impact reasonable suspicion analysis of police stop. Despite that predictive policing based on artificial intelligence lacks reliability and transparency, it provides legitimacy in police stop."

Contrary to traditional data which is typically stored in a relational database, big data varies in terms of volume, velocity, and variety. Big data is typically generated in large volumes. Big data comes from everywhere: social data, machine data and transactional data. Analytics has always involved attempts to improve decision making, and big data contributes that. Large organizations are seeking both faster and better decisions with big data, and Law enforcement also are seeking them. The big data trend promises that harnessing the wealth and volume of information leads to better operational efficiency, and competitive advantage. Traditional analytics tools are not well suited to capturing the full value of big data. Machine learning is ideal for unlocking hidden profits in big data. It fulfills the promise of extracting value from big data with less reliance on human intervention. It is well suited to the complexity of dealing with disparate data sources and the huge variety of variables and amounts of data involved. And unlike traditional analysis, machine learning thrives on growing datasets. The more data fed into a machine learning system, the more it can learn and apply the results to higher quality insights. One of the basic arguments in this article is extended enforcement of the digitalization of the criminal justice procedure. With the execution of Act on promoting the digitalization of the criminal justice procedure and Act on the use of electronic documents in summary procedures, A criminal justice agency shall store and keep decisions, indictments, warrants, records and other documents concerning criminal justice affairs by using their systems. The stored and kept data in this procedure is intrinsically characterized as Big data in terms of volume and variety. Byproducts of all this data are the new insights that can drive judicial decision making in new way. The new insights will contribute to a process of reform of our justice systems to render them more effective. In korea, substantial disparity in criminal sentencing is a critical issue. The Sentencing Guidelines were designed to eliminate this sentencing disparities. This article suggests that big data analytics will help to improve eliminating sentencing disparity and effective law-enforcement. This article presents the actuarial risk assessment instrument used to predict the risk of future dangerousness in United States. Actuarial method of risk assessment is designed to predict specific behaviors within a specific time frame. The stated goal of the actuarial method is to predict future dangerousness in a relative sense, by comparing an individual to a norm-based reference group. Big data analytics will also improve this actuarial risk assessment. This article also suggests Machine learning-based legal expert system that help judges explain why they decided that way. Since machine learning algorithm can be very good at detecting hard to observe relationship between data, it may be possible to detect obscured association between certain variables in criminal case and particular legal outcomes. Probably this expert system outperforms several experts in terms of predicting judicial outcomes."

Among the algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is known to be efficient for image processing tasks used for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems(ADAS). However, it is difficult to achieve real-time processing for CNN in vehicle embedded software environment due to the repeated operations contained in each layer of CNN. In this paper, we propose a hardware accelerator which enhances the execution time of CNN by parallelizing the repeated operations such as convolution. Xilinx ZC706 evaluation board is used to verify the performance of the proposed accelerator. For 36x36 input images, the hardware execution time of CNN is 2.812ms in 100MHz clock frequency and shows that our hardware can be executed in real-time."
Capturing variation and gradience in identity avoidance,2016,"['variation', 'gradience', 'identity avoidance', 'machine learning']",,"This paper makes the point that a grammar appears to be a sum of tendencies, rather than an aggregate of all-or-none instances. That is, the grammar is not formed by an across-the-board law, but teems with variation and gradience. For a case in point, this paper presents the phenomenon of consonant insertion in Korean total reduplication. To see whether this kind of grammar with variation and gradience can be possibly, and eventually humanly, learned, it is simulated using a model of grammar learning. The instantiation of machine learning in this paper shows that a grammar with variation and gradience can indeed be learned."

After that, we perform some prospective analysis to extract time-domain parameters, frequency-domain parameters, and nonlinear parameters of the signal. Those parameters are unique for each disease and can be used as the statistical symptoms for each disease. Then, we perform feature selection to improve the performance of the diagnosis classifier. We utilize the selected features to diagnose various diseases using machine learning. We subsequently measure the performance of the machine learning classifier to make sure that it will not misdiagnose the diseases.

Revisiting the Regression between Raw Outputs of Image Quality Metrics and Ground Truth Measurements,2016,,,"<P>In this paper, we aim to investigate the potential usefulness of machine learning in image quality assessment (IQA). Most previous studies have focused on designing effective image quality metrics (IQMs), and significant advances have been made in the development of IQMs over the last decade. Here, our goal is to improve prediction outcomes of 'any' given image quality metric. We call this the 'IQM's Outcome Improvement' problem, in order to distinguish the proposed approach from the existing IQA approaches. We propose a method that focuses on the underlying IQM and improves its prediction results by using machine learning techniques. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three different publicly available image databases. Particularly, through both 1) in-database and 2) cross-database validations, the generality and technological feasibility (in real-world applications) of our machine-learning-based algorithm have been evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework improves prediction outcomes of various existing commonly used IQMs (e.g., MSE, PSNR, SSIM-based IQMs, etc.) in terms of not only prediction accuracy, but also prediction monotonicity.</P>"
Detection of tropical cyclone genesis via quantitative satellite ocean surface wind pattern and intensity analyses using decision trees,2016,"['Tropical cyclone', 'Microwave sea surface wind', 'Dynamic pattern and intensity recognition', 'Machine learning']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Microwave remote sensing can be used to measure ocean surface winds, which can be used to detect tropical cyclone (TC) formation in an objective and quantitative way. This study develops a new model using WindSat data and a machine learning approach. Dynamic and hydrologic indices are quantified from WindSat wind and rainfall snapshot images over 352 developing and 973 non-developing tropical disturbances from 2005 to 2009. The degree of cyclonic circulation symmetry near the system center is quantified using circular variances, and the degree of strong wind aggregation (heavy rainfall) is defined using a spatial pattern analysis program tool called FRAGSTATS. In addition, the circulation strength and convection are defined based on the areal averages of wind speed and rainfall. An objective TC formation detection model is then developed by applying those indices to a machine-learning decision tree algorithm using calibration data from 2005 to 2007. Results suggest that the circulation symmetry and intensity are the most important parameters that characterize developing tropical disturbances. Despite inherent sampling issues associated with the polar orbiting satellite, a validation from 2008 to 2009 shows that the model produced a positive detection rate of approximately 95.3% and false alarm rate of 28.5%, which is comparable with the pre-existing objective methods based on cloud-pattern recognition.

Box-office forecasting based on sentiments of movie reviews and Independent subspace method,2016,"['Box-office forecasting', 'Motion pictures', 'Sentiment analysis', 'Movie reviews', 'Independent subspace model']",,"<P>Box-office forecasting is a challenging but important task for movie distributors in their decision making process. Many previous studies have tried to determine a way to accurately predict the box-office, but the results reported have not been satisfactory for two main reasons: (1) lack of variable diversity and (2) simplicity of forecasting algorithms. Although the importance of word-of-mouth (WOM) has consistently emphasized in past studies, only summarized information, such as volume or valence of user ratings is commonly used. In forecasting algorithms, multiple linear regression is the most popular algorithm because it generates not only predicted values but also variable significances. In this study, new box-office forecasting models are presented to enhance the forecasting accuracy by utilizing review sentiments and employing non-linear machine learning algorithms. Viewer sentiments from review texts are used as input variables in addition to conventional predictors, whereas three machine learning-based algorithms, i.e., classification and regression tree (CART), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR), are employed to capture non-linear relationship between the box-office and its predictors. In order to provide variable importance for machine learning-based forecasting algorithms, an independent subspace method (ISM) is applied. Forecasting results from six different forecasting periods show that the presented methods can make accurate and robust forecasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</P>"

Strength prediction of rotary brace damper using MLR and MARS,2016,"['rotary brace damper', 'passive energy dissipation', 'nonlinear response', 'MLR', 'MARS', 'damper strength']",,"This study predicts the strength of rotary brace damper by analyzing a new set of probabilistic models using the usual method of multiple linear regressions (MLR) and advanced machine-learning methods of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Rotary brace damper can be easily assembled with high energy-dissipation capability. To investigate the behavior of this damper in structures, a steel frame is modeled with this device subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. Several response parameters are considered, and the performance of damper in reducing each response is evaluated. MLR and MARS methods were used to predict the strength of this damper. Displacement was determined to be the most effective parameter of damper strength, whereas the thickness did not exhibit any effect. Adding thickness parameter as inputs to MARS and MLR models did not increase the accuracies of the models in predicting the strength of this damper. The MARS model with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.127 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.090 performed better than the MLR model with an RMSE of 0.221 and MAE of 0.181."

연관성 방향을 고려한 부호 헬링거 측도의 제안,2016,,,"By Wikipedia, data mining is the process of discovering patterns in a big data set involving methods at the intersection of association rule, decision tree, clustering, artificial intelligence, machine learning. and database systems. Association rule is a method for discovering interesting relations between items in large transactions by interestingness measures. Association rule interestingness measures play a major role within a knowledge discovery process in databases, and have been developed by many researchers. Among them, the Hellinger measure is a good association threshold considering the information content and the generality of a rule. But it has the drawback that it can not determine the direction of the association. In this paper we proposed a signed Hellinger measure to be able to interpret operationally, and we checked three conditions of association threshold. Furthermore, we investigated some aspects through a few examples. The results showed that the signed Hellinger measure was better than the Hellinger measure because the signed one was able to estimate the right direction of association."

For collision evasion, the vehicle detection system is required. In general, existing learning-based vehicle detection methods use the entire appearance of the vehicles from rear-view images, so that each vehicle types should be learned separately since they have distinct rear-view appearance regarding the types. To overcome such shortcoming, we learn Haar-like features from the lower part of the vehicles which contain tail lights to detect vehicles leveraging the fact that the lower part is consistent regardless of vehicle types. As a verification procedure, we detect tail lights to distinguish actual vehicles and non-vehicles. If candidates are too small to detect the tail lights, we use HOG(Histogram Of Gradient) feature and SVM(Support Vector Machine) classifier to reduce false alarms. The proposed forward vehicle detection method shows accuracy of 95% even in the complicated images with many buildings by the road, regardless of vehicle types."

Recently, the AI “AlphaGo” has won 4 wins and 1 loss to Lee Sedol. AlphaGo is a computer program developed by Google DeepMind to play the board game Go. Also, after AI learned Rembrandt`s past work, it also reproduced the style. In Japan, a novel written by AI passed the primary review of the literary award. Research and development of AI is acceleratingly advanced. Along with the rapid development of AI, a new legal environment has been created that could not be considered in the past. For example, how to legally protect music and novels created by AI is a problem. However, the new legal problems arising from AI are not limited to the domain of such intellectual property law. Due to the increase in the possibility of automatic traveling vehicles due to the development of AI, various problems such as civil liability problems, criminal liability problems and the like at the time of accident occurrence, can only occur. Looking at AI in terms of law and institution, judgment and action of AI are considered to be the subject legal responsibility. For example, such an example is the liability for compensation when an accident occurs in autonomous driving of a self-running vehicle. Designers of artificial intelligence, manufacturers of products with AI and operators are involved, and it is necessary to organize where the legal responsibility lies. However, such a problem does not end with the issue of legislation theory. We have to consider various issues such as national consensus and economic and social ripple effects for develop such laws and institutions. With the era of AI, the immediate task is to prepare for legal problems related to machines and robots equipped with AI without free will. It is thought that it plays a role in charge of tasks given under the direction of human beings without free will also in case of a robot equipped with AI before the appearance of so-called AI robot with free will. That is, it is thought that the AI robot acts on its own within a limited range by human instructions. Therefore, it is expected that AI owners, their partners, the manufacturing industry, and the society`s overall safety system will harmonize and solve the problem even when AI draws legal problems. In the AI era we must reasonably adjust the interests of the parties concerned over such legal liability. And it is thought that we must exercise wisdom to create a social system to enjoy a safe and useful life. In other words, if an AI robot that can have free will, thinking with human beings, acquiring knowledge and acting themselves emerges, the robot may occupy more than a simple machine. In other words, an era in which symbiosis of humans and AI robots is possible may come. However, such a story is still only a story of the SF future world. In the end, it can be said that the choice for whether or not to give free will to AI robots is a challenge left for human beings."

In this paper, we propose a method that estimates human size by constructing an indoor scene in 3D space. Since the human has constant size everywhere in 3D space, it is possible to estimate accurate human size in 2D image by projecting 3D human into the image space.

It is proposed that in developing robot ethics for the autonomous vehicle an incremental, hybrid approach should be adopted, because driving cars is related to the safety of road traffic and the interests of other people. At first, it should be formed through top-down approach by combining of the two ethical theories: modified Asimov`s Three Laws of Robotics and harm-minimizing algorithm. The former, modified from the Asimov`s Three Laws of Robotics and adjusted to the autonomous vehicle, is partly suitable for the self-driving program due to its straightforwardness, hierarchical structure and emphasis on the rights of humans. And the latter, a program based on the utilitarianism, is also partly acceptable, because it makes the program in self-driving cars possible the calculation of the harms in case of the imminent accident. And then, upon this top-down approach, the information on the situation of roads, driving culture and other technological considerations should be supplemented by bottom-up approach, such as machine learning. In conclusion, the followings are suggested as the legal implications of the robot ethics of the autonomous vehicles: Firstly, the harm-minimizing algorithm should be scrutinized beforehand that it could be approved by the constitutional values, because in some cases it may be construed as the targeting and discriminating choices among human victims. Secondly, the laws, especially traffic laws should make up for the lacunas, that inevitably exist in robot ethics of the autonomous vehicles. Thirdly, the potential social preferences that may be caused through the priorities shown by the self-driving program should be controlled in view of the public interests. Finally, the principle-based regulations would be better than the specific and individual regulations as the laws that govern the autonomous vehicles, in order that they may always keep pace with the development of technologies."

Even though various influencing factors of power consumption have been discovered for the educational institutions by analyzing power consumption patterns and usage cases, further studies are required for the quantitative prediction of electric load. In this paper, we build an electric load forecasting model by implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms. To do that, we consider three building clusters in a campus and collect their power consumption every 15 minutes for more than one year. In the preprocessing, features are represented by considering periodic characteristic of the data and principal component analysis is performed for the features.

SVM을 이용한 VKOSPI 일 중 변화 예측과 실제 옵션 매매에의 적용,2016,"['기계학습', 'SVM', '옵션 매매', 'Machine Learning', 'Support Vector Machine', 'VKOSPI', 'Option Trading']",,"Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence. It refers to an area of computer science related to providing machines the ability to perform their own data analysis, decision making and forecasting. For example, one of the representative machine learning models is artificial neural network, which is a statistical learning algorithm inspired by the neural network structure of biology. In addition, there are other machine learning models such as decision tree model, naive bayes model and SVM(support vector machine) model. Among the machine learning models, we use SVM model in this study because it is mainly used for classification and regression analysis that fits well to our study. The core principle of SVM is to find a reasonable hyperplane that distinguishes different group in the data space. Given information about the data in any two groups, the SVM model judges to which group the new data belongs based on the hyperplane obtained from the given data set. Thus, the more the amount of meaningful data, the better the machine learning ability.  In recent years, many financial experts have focused on machine learning, seeing the possibility of combining with machine learning and the financial field where vast amounts of financial data exist. Machine learning techniques have been proved to be powerful in describing the non-stationary and chaotic stock price dynamics. A lot of researches have been successfully conducted on forecasting of stock prices using machine learning algorithms. Recently, financial companies have begun to provide Robo-Advisor service, a compound word of Robot and Advisor, which can perform various financial tasks through advanced algorithms using rapidly changing huge amount of data. Robo-Advisers main task is to advise the investors about the investors personal investment propensity and to provide the service to manage the portfolio automatically.  In this study, we propose a method of forecasting the Korean volatility index, VKOSPI, using the SVM model, which is one of the machine learning methods, and applying it to real option trading to increase the trading performance. VKOSPI is a measure of the future volatility of the KOSPI 200 index based on KOSPI 200 index option prices. VKOSPI is similar to the VIX index, which is based on S&P 500 option price in the United States. The Korea Exchange(KRX) calculates and announce the real-time VKOSPI index. VKOSPI is the same as the usual volatility and affects the option prices. The direction of VKOSPI and option prices show positive relation regardless of the option type (call and put options with various striking prices). If the volatility increases, all of the call and put option premium increases because the probability of the options exercise possibility increases. The investor can know the rising value of the option price with respect to the volatility rising value in real time through Vega, a Black-Scholess measurement index of an options sensitivity to changes in the volatility. Therefore, accurate forecasting of VKOSPI movements is one of the important factors that can generate profit in option trading.  In this study, we verified through real option data that the accurate forecast of VKOSPI is able to make a big profit in real option trading. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies on the idea of predicting the direction of VKOSPI based on machine learning and introducing the idea of applying it to actual option trading.

Wearable Sensor-Based Biometric Gait Classification Algorithm Using WEKA,2016,"['Classification', 'Gait analysis', 'Machine learning algorithm', 'WEKA']",,"Gait-based classification has gained much interest as a possible authentication method because it incorporate an intrinsic personal signature that is difficult to mimic. The study investigates machine learning techniques to mitigate the natural variations in gait among different subjects. We incorporated several machine learning algorithms into this study using the data mining package called Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). WEKA's convenient interface enabled us to apply various sets of machine learning algorithms to understand whether each algorithm can capture certain distinctive gait features. First, we defined 24 gait features by analyzing three-axis acceleration data, and then selectively used them for distinguishing subjects 10 years of age or younger from those aged 20 to 40. We also applied a machine learning voting scheme to improve the accuracy of the classification. The classification accuracy of the proposed system was about 81% on average."
천문학에서의 대용량 자료 분석,2016,,,"Recent astronomical survey observations have produced substantial amounts of data as well as completely changed conventional methods of analyzing astronomical data. Both classical statistical inference and modern machine learning methods have been used in every step of data analysis that range from data calibration to inferences of physical models. We are seeing the growing popularity of using machine learning methods in classical problems of astronomical data analysis due to low-cost data acquisition using cheap large-scale detectors and fast computer networks that enable us to share large volumes of data. It is common to consider the effects of inhomogeneous spatial and temporal coverage in the analysis of big astronomical data. The growing size of the data requires us to use parallel distributed computing environments as well as machine learning algorithms. Distributed data analysis systems have not been adopted widely for the general analysis of massive astronomical data. Gathering adequate training data is expensive in observation and learning data are generally collected from multiple data sources in astronomy; therefore, semi-supervised and ensemble machine learning methods will become important for the analysis of big astronomical data."

In this paper, we propose an hardware architecture which enables real-time applications using SVM classification. We used parallel architecture to simultaneously calculate MAC operations, and also designed the system for several feature extractors for compatibility.

Since these images are 3-channel color images, they have a problem with applying to CNN. To solve this problem, we used each 1-channel grayscale image (Red, Green, Blue) that was separated from 3-channel color images. We were able to detect QFN solder defects by using this CNN.

Relation extraction based on two-step classification with distant supervision,2016,,,"<P>Supervised machine learning methods have been widely used in relation extraction to find the relation between two named entities in a sentence.

To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a two-step relation extraction model with distant supervision. The two-step model consists of a one-class model and a multi-class model. The one-class model selects positive sentences from input sentences and the multi-class model classifies the positive sentences into specific classes.

DCCC-MAC: A Dynamic Common-Control-Channel-Based MAC Protocol for Cellular Cognitive Radio Networks,2016,"['support vector machine (SVM)', 'Cognitive radio network (CRN)', 'common control channel (CCC)', 'machine learning', 'medium access control (MAC)']",,"<P>We propose a novel dynamic common-control-channel-based medium access control (DCCC-MAC) protocol for cellular (centralized) cognitive radio (CR) networks. Specifically, unlike the traditional dedicated-control-channel-based medium access control (MAC) protocols, the proposed MAC protocol eliminates the requirement of a dedicated channel for control information exchange. During a given transmission frame, the common control channel (CCC) is selected by a cooperating set of secondary users (SUs) by using a support-vector-machine (SVM)-based learning technique. In the DCCC-MAC protocol, the frame duration is divided into four main phases as follows: spectrum sensing, CCC selection, data transmission, and beaconing. The SUs that participate in the CCC selection process are allocated channels for data transmission during a frame interval using a scheduling process, whereas the other SUs have to contend to access the channels. We present an analytical approach to calculate the minimum required number of minislots in the transmission frame for a given number of SUs in the CCC selection process. The saturation throughput of the proposed MAC protocol is analyzed in closed form. To this end, the numerical and simulation results are presented to quantify the performance of the proposed DCCC-MAC protocol. We also compare the performance of the DCCC-MAC protocol with that of two other state-of-the-art CR MAC protocols that use CCCs.</P>"

In the present study, we employed a well established machine learning technique of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model in the trend analyses of groundwater level for the long-term change. The major benefit of GPR model is that the model provide not only the future predictions but also the associated uncertainty. In the study, the long-term predictions of groundwater level from the stations of National Groundwater Monitoring Network located within Han River Basin were exemplified as prediction cases based on the GPR model. In addition, a few types of groundwater change patterns were delineated (i.e., increasing, decreasing, and no trend) on the basis of the statistics acquired from GPR analyses. From the study, it was found that the majority of the monitoring stations has decreasing trend while small portion shows increasing or no trend. To further analyze the causes of the trend, the corresponding precipitation data were jointly analyzed by the same method (i.e., GPR). Based on the analyses, the major cause of decreasing trend of groundwater level is attributed to reduction of precipitation rate whereas a few of the stations show weak relationship between the pattern of groundwater level changes and precipitation."

Methods: 201,849 Health & Welfare related online documents from January 1 to March 31, 2016 from 171 Korean online channels and analyzed such documents using machine learning with random forest and Apriori algorithm association analysis. We used R software (version 3.2.1) for the association analysis data mining and visualization. Results: As for the prediction of future signals of health and welfare policies, policies that were important and supported by the people were welfare payment, health promotion, job, marriage/childbirth, health insurance, and healthcare industry (in this order). Specifically, as support for documents mentioning welfare payment and jobs was high, job creation through building a spontaneous welfare system is thought to be needed. Additionally, similar to the linkage analysis result of policies, as people were against documents that mentioned only {basic pension} policies, but supported documents that included {basic pension, welfare payment, job}, there is a strong demand for the establishment of a welfare system through active self-support and labor of the elderly. Conclusions: Social big data can be utilized in various areas. First, similar to the application in this study, future signals concerning government`s policies and new technologies can be predicted in advance and prepared for. Second, they can be used as a new data collection methods that supplement limitations in survey data collection systems.

A Comprehensive Review of Emerging Computational Methods for Gene Identification,2016,"['Cloud Computing', 'Comparative Methods', 'Deep Learning', 'Fourier Transform', 'Gene Identification', 'Gene Prediction', 'Hidden Markov Model', 'Machine Learning', 'Protein-Coding Region', 'Support Vector Machine']",,"Gene identification is at the center of genomic studies. Although the first phase of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has been claimed to be complete, the annotation of the functional elements is far from being so. Computational methods in gene identification continue to play important roles in this area and other relevant issues. So far, a lot of work has been performed on this area, and a plethora of computational methods and avenues have been developed. Many review papers have summarized these methods and other related work. However, most of them focus on the methodologies from a particular aspect or perspective. Different from these existing bodies of research, this paper aims to comprehensively summarize the mainstream computational methods in gene identification and tries to provide a short but concise technical reference for future studies. Moreover, this review sheds light on the emerging trends and cutting-edge techniques that are believed to be capable of leading the research on this field in the future."
기계학습 모형과 잔차 크리깅을 이용한 저해상도 위성기반 강수 자료의 공간 상세화,2016,"['상세화', '강수', '기계학습', '크리깅 disaggregation', 'precipitation', 'machine learning', 'kriging']",,"A novel disaggregation model that combines a machine learning model and kriging of residuals is presented to map precipitation at a fine scale from coarse scale precipitation data. Random forest (RF) and fine scale auxiliary variables are used to estimate trend components at a fine scale. Residual components are then estimated by area-to-point residual kriging. A case study of spatial disaggregation of TRMM monthly precipitation data acquired over the Korean peninsula is carried out to illustrate the potential of the presented disaggregation method. From the evaluation results, the presented method outperformed the RF-based disaggregation method that only considers trend components and ignores residual components, in terms of accuracy statistics and the ability of coherent predictions. This case study indicates that accounting for residual components by applying a proper spatial prediction method such as area-to-point kriging is very important in spatial disaggregation of coarse scale spatial data, even though advanced regression models such as RF could have high goodness of fit for the quantification of relationships between a target attribute and auxiliary variables."

Therefore, the Korean curriculum has also changed into the direction of the creative thinking through increasing short-answer questions that can determine the overall thinking of the students. However, their scoring results are a little bit inconsistency because scoring short-answer questions depends on the subjective scoring of human raters. In order to alleviate this point, an automated scoring system using a machine learning has been used as a scoring tool in overseas. Linguistically, Korean and English is totally different in the structure of the sentences. Thus, the automated scoring system used in English cannot be applied to Korean. In this paper, we introduce an automated scoring system for Korean short-answer questions using predictability and unanimity. We also verify the practicality of the automatic scoring system through the correlation coefficient between the results of the automated scoring system and those of human raters. In the experiment of this paper, the proposed system is evaluated for constructed-response items of Korean language, social studies, and science in the National Assessment of Educational Achievement. The analysis was used Pearson correlation coefficients and Kappa coefficient. Results of the experiment had showed a strong positive correlation with all the correlation coefficients at 0.7 or higher. Thus, the scoring results of the proposed scoring system are similar to those of human raters. Therefore, the automated scoring system should be found to be useful as a scoring tool."

Our method detects potential malicious domains from the seed domain information extracted from the TLD Zone files and WHOIS information. The inference process follows the three steps: searching the candidate domains, machine learning, and generating a suspicious domain pool. In the first step, we search the TLD Zone files and build a candidate domain set which has the same name server information with the seed domain. The next step clusters the candidate domains by the similarity of the WHOIS information. The final step in the inference process finds the seed domain’s cluster, and make the cluster as a suspicious domain set. In experiments, we used .COM and .NET TLD Zone files, and tested 10 seed domains selected by our analysts.

Real time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environments,2016,,,"<P>In recent years, the number of people using the Internet and network services is increasing day by day. On a daily basis, a large amount of data is generated over the Internet from zeta byte to petabytes with a very high speed. On the other hand, we see more security threats on the network, the Internet, websites, and the enterprise network. Therefore, detecting intrusion in such ultra-high-speed environment in real time is a challenging task. Many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are proposed for various types of network attacks using machine learning approaches. Most of them are unable to detect recent unknown attacks, whereas the others do not provide a real-time solution to overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environment using Hadoop implementation. The proposed system includes four-layered IDS architecture, which consists of the capturing layer, filtration and load balancing layer, processing or Hadoop layer, and the decision-making layer. Furthermore, feature selection scheme is proposed that selects nine parameters for classification using (FSR) and (BER), as well as from the analysis of DARPA datasets. In addition, five major machine learning approaches are used to evaluate the proposed system including J48, REPTree, random forest tree, conjunctive rule, support vector machine, and Na < ve Bayes classifiers. Results show that among all these classifiers, REPTree and J48 are the best classifiers in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency. The proposed system architecture is evaluated with respect to accuracy in terms of true positive (TP) and false positive (FP), with respect to efficiency in terms of processing time and by comparing results with traditional techniques.

Design Hybrid Models for Opinion Mining on Vietnamese Social Media Text Data,2016,"['Opinion Mining', 'Social Media', 'Coffee Franchise', 'Hybrid Models', 'Vietnamese']",,"The rapid development of information communications technology, especially Internet and smartphones, helps customers be more flexible and easier to access social networking sites and use them as effective communication tools. A huge number of informal messages are posted every day in social networking sites including comments, opinions and feedbacks about products, services or companies. These text data are not only in English but also in several other languages as the social networking sites develop across countries. It has become difficult and time consuming for individuals or organizations to effectively process the information underlined in these text data.

온라인 주식 포럼의 핫토픽 탐지를 위한 감성분석 모형의 개발,2016,"['감성분석', '오피니언 마이닝', 'SM', '핫토픽', '온라인 포럼', 'Sentiment Analysis', 'Opinion Mining', 'SVM', 'Hot topic', 'Online forums']",,"Document classification based on emotional polarity has become a welcomed emerging task owing to the great explosion of data on the Web. In the big data age, there are too many information sources to refer to when making decisions. For example, when considering travel to a city, a person may search reviews from a search engine such as Google or social networking services (SNSs) such as blogs, Twitter, and Facebook. The emotional polarity of positive and negative reviews helps a user decide on whether or not to make a trip. Sentiment analysis of customer reviews has become an important research topic as datamining technology is widely accepted for text mining of the Web. Sentiment analysis has been used to classify documents through machine learning techniques, such as the decision tree, neural networks, and support vector machines (SVMs). is used to determine the attitude, position, and sensibility of people who write articles about various topics that are published on the Web. Regardless of the polarity of customer reviews, emotional reviews are very helpful materials for analyzing the opinions of customers through their reviews. Sentiment analysis helps with understanding what customers really want instantly through the help of automated text mining techniques. Sensitivity analysis utilizes text mining techniques on text on the Web to extract subjective information in the text for text analysis. Sensitivity analysis is utilized to determine the attitudes or positions of the person who wrote the article and presented their opinion about a particular topic.  In this study, we developed a model that selects a hot topic from user posts at Chinas online stock forum by using the k-means algorithm and self-organizing map (SOM). In addition, we developed a detecting model to predict a hot topic by using machine learning techniques such as logit, the decision tree, and SVM. We employed sensitivity analysis to develop our model for the selection and detection of hot topics from China’s online stock forum. The sensitivity analysis calculates a sentimental value from a document based on contrast and classification according to the polarity sentimental dictionary (positive or negative).  The online stock forum was an attractive site because of its information about stock investment. Users post numerous texts about stock movement by analyzing the market according to government policy announcements, market reports, reports from research institutes on the economy, and even rumors. We divided the online forum’s topics into 21 categories to utilize sentiment analysis. One hundred forty-four topics were selected among 21 categories at online forums about stock. The posts were crawled to build a positive and negative text database. We ultimately obtained 21,141 posts on 88 topics by preprocessing the text from March 2013 to February 2015. The interest index was defined to select the hot topics, and the k-means algorithm and SOM presented equivalent results with this data. We developed a decision tree model to detect hot topics with three algorithms: CHAID, CART, and C4.5. The results of CHAID were subpar compared to the others. We also employed SVM to detect the hot topics from negative data. The SVM models were trained with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel function by a grid search to detect the hot topics.  The detection of hot topics by using sentiment analysis provides the latest trends and hot topics in the stock forum for investors so that they no longer need to search the vast amounts of information on the Web. Our proposed model is also helpful to rapidly determine customers’ signals or attitudes towards government policy and firms’ products and services."

However great the benefits of AI might be, the risk of losing control of the intelligence created is still greater. And Some concerned that strong AI may threaten the existence of humanity. Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates Warn About Artificial Intelligence. There are numerous ethical, policy, and legal issues relating to creation and deployment of artificial intelligence. Moreover, It is difficult defining what, exactly, “artificial intelligence” means. Rather than mentioning a particular point of view on the artificial intelligence technology, the primary aim of this paper is to promote awareness of nature of artificial intelligence to encourage lawyers, policy makers, and other relevant stakeholders to consider what may be appropriate legal and regulatory responses to artificial intelligence as they are being developed and deployed. Regulations are divided into two categories, ex ante and ex post regulation. The government should regulate the development and operation of artificial intelligence robot, autonomous vehicles by rulemaking, and permits current development and operation under certain conditions, should impose additional oversight on the development and operation of AI robot. But regulation by government would be difficult because A.I. research and development may be discreet, discrete, diffuse, and opaque. The ex ante regulation uses a judicially imposed liability system of corrective justice that requires wrongdoers to compensate victims for injury caused by a wrongdoing. But the autonomous nature of A.I. creates issues of foreseeability and control that might render ex post regulation ineffective. It is important to search for a balance between ex-ante and ex-post regulation for AI development."

Temporal Search Algorithm for Multiple-Pedestrian Tracking,2016,"['tracking', 'search algorithm', 'machine learning', 'point correspondence', 'decision tree']",,"In this paper, we provide a trajectory-generation algorithm that can identify pedestrians in real time. Typically, the contours for the extraction of pedestrians from the foreground of images are not clear due to factors including brightness and shade; furthermore, pedestrians move in different directions and interact with each other. These issues mean that the identification of pedestrians and the generation of trajectories are somewhat difficult. We propose a new method for trajectory generation regarding multiple pedestrians. The first stage of the method distinguishes between those pedestrian-blob situations that need to be merged and those that require splitting, followed by the use of trained decision trees to separate the pedestrians. The second stage generates the trajectories of each pedestrian by using the point-correspondence method; however, we introduce a new point-correspondence algorithm for which the A* search method has been modified. By using fuzzy membership functions, a heuristic evaluation of the correspondence between the blobs was also conducted. The proposed method was implemented and tested with the PETS 2009 dataset to show an effective multiple-pedestrian-tracking capability in a pedestrian-interaction environment."

In this paper, we introduce a robust lane detection method based on a CNN combined with random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Initially, we calculate edges in an image using a hat shaped kernel, then we detect lanes using the CNN combined with the RANSAC. In the training process of the CNN, input data consists of edge images and target data is images that have real white color lanes on an otherwise black background. The CNN structure consists of 8 layers with 3 convolutional layers, 2 subsampling layers and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) of 3 fully-connected layers. Convolutional and subsampling layers are hierarchically arranged to form a deep structure.

Multi-view gait recognition using a doubly-kernel approach on the Grassmann manifold,2016,"['Gait recognition', 'Multi-view recognition', 'Kernel learning', 'Grassmann manifold', 'Subspace representation', 'Pattern recognition']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>View variation is one of the greatest challenges faced by the gait recognition research community. Recently, there are studies that model sets of gait features from multiple views as linear subspaces, which are known to form a special manifold called the Grassmann manifold. Conjecturing that modeling via linear subspace representation is not completely sufficient for gait recognition across view change, we take a step forward to consider non-linear subspace representation. A collection of multi-view gait features encapsulated in the form of a linear subspace is projected to the non-linear subspace through the expansion coefficients induced by kernel principal component analysis. Since subspace representation is inherently non-Euclidean, naïve vectorization as input to the vector-based pattern analysis machines is expected to yield suboptimal accuracy performance. We deal with this difficulty by embedding the manifold in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) through a positive definite kernel function defined on the Grassmann manifold. A closer examination reveals that the proposed approach can actually be interpreted as a doubly-kernel method. To be specific, the first kernel maps the linear subspace representation non-linearly to a feature space; while the second kernel permits the application of kernelization-enabled machines established for vector-based data on the manifold-valued multi-view gait features. Experiments on the CASIA gait database shows that the proposed doubly-kernel method is effective against view change in gait recognition.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  A Grassmann doubly-kernel approach is presented for multi-view gait recognition. </LI> <LI>  A collection of multi-view gait samples are represented as linear subspaces. </LI> <LI>  Non-linear variant of original subspaces are constructed via basis induced by KPCA. </LI> <LI>  Kernelized Grassmann kernels are introduced for application of vector-based method. </LI> <LI>  Experiments show promising results for gait recognition with vast view difference. </LI> </UL> </P>"

In FsGr model, sets of similar gestures will be produced through training phase, in order to define the notion of a set of similar gestures. At the 1st attempt of gesture recognition, if the result turns out to belong to a set of similar gestures, it makes the 2nd recognition attempt to feature-strengthened parts extracted from the set of similar gestures. However, since a same gesture show drastically different characteristics according to physical traits such as body size, age, and sex, FsGr model may not be good enough to apply to multi-user environments. In this paper, we propose FsGrM model that extends FsGr model for multi-user environment and present a program which controls channel and volume of smart TV using FsGrM model."

The Effect of PCA On Kernel Classifiers For the Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease,2016,"['Alzheimer’s Disease', 'PCA', 'SVM', '알츠하이머병', '주성분분석', '서포트벡터머신']",,"This paper proposes the effect of principal component analysis (PCA) on many kernel classification techniques, such as (i) Single kernel Multi-Class support vector machine (SVM), (ii) Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) and (iii) Generalized Multiple Kernel Learning (GMKL). PCA is a sophisticated way to reduce the dimensionality of high dimensional data, specially the high dimensional imaging data, while keeping most of the informative representative dimensions and excluding the least important ones. The aim of this Paper is to figure out whether PCA is actually a good idea in practice with kernel classifiers or not, in order to find a better framework for classification and analysis of brain imaging features in the study of Alzheimer’s disease. For this experiment the data used is FreeSurfer mean cortical thickness dataset downloaded from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu) baseline data. The classification accuracy (in classifying the three classes CN, LMCI, AD) of comparative methods has been evaluated using 3-fold cross validation. As a result of this comparative study, we could observe that applying PCA on different kernel classification methods has improved the classification accuracy."
Intelligence System for Diagnosis Level of Coronary Heart Disease with K-Star Algorithm,2016,"['Computational Intelligance', 'Diagnosis', 'Heart Disease', 'Classification', 'Machine Learning']",,"Objectives: Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and it is important to diagnose the level of the disease. Intelligence systems for diagnosis proved can be used to support diagnosis of the disease. Unfortunately, most of the data available between the level/type of coronary heart disease is unbalanced. As a result system performance is low. Methods: This paper proposes an intelligence systems for the diagnosis of the level of coronary heart disease taking into account the problem of data imbalance. The first stage of this research was preprocessing, which included resampled non-stratified random sampling (R), the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), clean data out of range attribute (COR), and remove duplicate (RD). The second step was the sharing of data for training and testing using a k-fold cross-validation model and training multiclass classification by the K-star algorithm. The third step was performance evaluation. The proposed system was evaluated using the performance parameters of sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction value (PPV), negative prediction value (NPV), area under the curve (AUC) and F-measure. Results: The results showed that the proposed system provides an average performance with sensitivity of 80.1%, specificity of 95%, PPV of 80.1%, NPV of 95%, AUC of 87.5%, and Fmeasure of 80.1%. Performance of the system without consideration of data imbalance provide showed sensitivity of 53.1%, specificity of 88,3%, PPV of 53.1%, NPV of 88.3%, AUC of 70.7%, and F-measure of 53.1%.

No-reference Image Quality Assessment With A Gradient-induced Dictionary,2016,"['Image quality assessment', 'no-reference', 'dictionary', 'K-means clustering', 'SVM']",,"Image distortions are typically characterized by degradations of structures. Dictionaries learned from natural images can capture the underlying structures in images, which are important for image quality assessment (IQA). This paper presents a general-purpose no-reference image quality metric using a GRadient-Induced Dictionary (GRID). A dictionary is first constructed based on gradients of natural images using K-means clustering. Then image features are extracted using the dictionary based on Euclidean-norm coding and max-pooling. A distortion classification model and several distortion-specific quality regression models are trained using the support vector machine (SVM) by combining image features with distortion types and subjective scores, respectively. To evaluate the quality of a test image, the distortion classification model is used to determine the probabilities that the image belongs to different kinds of distortions, while the regression models are used to predict the corresponding distortion-specific quality scores. Finally, an overall quality score is computed as the probability-weighted distortion-specific quality scores. The proposed metric can evaluate image quality accurately and efficiently using a small dictionary. The performance of the proposed method is verified on public image quality databases. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric can generate quality scores highly consistent with human perception, and it outperforms the state-of-the-arts."

Joint components based pedestrian detection in crowded scenes using extended feature descriptors,2016,"['Joint components', 'Haar-like feature', 'Histograms of oriented gradient', 'Boosting machines', 'Support vector machine', 'Multiple scales of block based HOG features']",,"This paper presents a framework for human detection based on the joint component model using extended feature descriptors. This framework provides two contributions for handling the partially occluded problem of pedestrian detection in crowded environments. First, it presents feature descriptors based on extension of two well-known feature descriptors for accommodation in partially occluded pedestrian detection. The feature descriptors, which use multiple scale blocks-based histograms of oriented gradients (MHOG) and parallelogram based Haar-like feature (PHF), are proposed for improving the accuracy of the detection system. As a result of using MHOG, an extensive feature space allows for the obtaining of highly discriminated features, which supports robust detection. On the other hand, the PHF is adaptive for the shape of human limbs in detection of pedestrians. This contribution also presents special data structures to store image intensities and image gradients for using an integral image method, which is helpful for fast computation for both feature descriptors. Second, the joint component model for human detection is proposed for the training and detecting of pedestrians in crowded scenes. The proposed detection method based on fusion of the boosting technique and the support vector machine (SVM) is presented. The SVM is known as one of the most efficient learning models for classification. The advantage of boosting is a strong classifier based on a combination set of weak classifiers. However, the performance of boosting depends on the kernel of element classifier. The method based on the extended feature descriptors and the joint component model is helpful for constructing an efficient classification. The experimental results demonstrate that this method for pedestrian detection outperforms current methods in crowded situations under a variety of outdoor environments."

The most important environmental factors influencing the hibernation sites was found to be the inclination(41.4%), followed by altitude(20.4%), distance from the trail(10.9%), and age group(7.7%) in the order of their contribution. A comparison between the hibernation habitat and the normal habitat of Asiatic Black Bear indicated that the average altitude of the hibernation sites was 63m, whereas the average altitude of the normal habitat was approximately 400m. The average inclination was found to be 7°, and a preference for the steeper inclination of 12–43°was also observed. The average distance of the hibernation site from the road was approximately 300m; the range of separation distance was found to be 1,300–2,400m. This was thought to be the result of a safer selection of winter hibernation site by preventing human contact and outside invasion. This study analyzes the habitat environmental factors for the selection of hibernation sites that prevent severe cold and other threats during the hibernation period in order to provide fundamental data for hibernation ecology and habitat management of Asiatic Black Bear."

Hence, this study proposes a way to deduce the propensity to invest in unstructured data that customers voluntarily exposed during consultation or online. Since prediction performance based on unstructured document differs according to the characteristics of text, in this study, classification algorithm optimized for the characteristic of text left by financial consumers is selected by performing prediction performance evaluation of various learning discrimination algorithms and proposed an intelligent method that automatically recommends investment products. User tests were given to MBA students. After showing the recommended investment and list of investment products, satisfaction was asked.

For accurate and prompt crime prediction and prevention, both a classification model of crime with high accuracy based on past criminal records and well-designed system interface are required. However previous studies on the analysis of crime factors have limitations in terms of accuracy due to the difficulty of data preprocessing. In addition, existing crime monitoring systems merely offer a vast amount of crime analysis results, thereby they fail to provide users with functions for more effective monitoring. In this paper, we propose a classification model for types of crime based on random-forest algorithms and system design factors for real-time crime prediction. From our experiments, we proved that our proposed classification model is superior to others that only use criminal records in terms of accuracy. Through the analysis of existing crime monitoring systems, we also designed and developed a system for real-time crime monitoring."

Moreover, using dynamically generating massive social data, social user`s real-time reaction analysis tasks is hard to accomplish. In the paper, to capture easily the semantics of massive and informal on-line documents with unsupervised learning mechanism, we design and implement automatic topic extraction systems according to the mass of the words that consists a document. The input data set to the proposed system are generated first, using N-gram algorithm to build multiple words to capture the meaning of the sentences precisely, and Hadoop and Spark (In-memory distributed computing framework) are adopted to run topic model. In the experiment phases, TB level input data are processed for data preprocessing and proposed topic extraction steps are applied. We conclude that the proposed system shows good performance in extracting meaningful topics in time as the intermediate results come from main memories directly instead of an HDD reading."

Individuals’ drowsy behavior detection technology should be developed to prevent drowsiness related crashes. Driving information such as acceleration, steering angle and velocity, and physiological signals of drivers such as electroencephalogram (EEG), and eye tracking are adopted in present drowsy behavior detection technologies. However, it is difficult to measure physiological signal, and eye tracking requires complex experiment equipment. As a result, driving information is adopted for drowsy driving detection. In order to achieve this purpose, driving experiment is performed for obtaining driving information through driving simulator. Moreover, this paper investigates effects of using different input parameter combinations, which is consisted of lateral acceleration, longitudinal acceleration, and steering angles with different time window sizes (i.e. 4 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 60 s), on drowsy driving detection using random forest algorithm. 20 s-size datasets using parameter combination of accelerations in lateral and longitudinal directions, compared to the other combination cases of driving information such as steering angles combined with lateral and longitudinal acceleration, steering angles only, longitudinal acceleration only, and lateral acceleration only, is considered the most effective information for drivers’ drowsy behavior detection. Moreover, comparing to ANN algorithm, RF algorithm performs better on processing complex input data for drowsy behavior detection. The results, which reveal high accuracy 84.8 % on drowsy driving behavior detection, can be applied on condition of operating real vehicles."

These are human-robot interaction (HRI) researchers utilize digital image processing, pattern recognition and machine learning for their studies. Facial feature point detector algorithms are very important for face recognition, gaze tracking, expression, and emotion recognition. In this paper, a cascade facial feature point detector is used for finding facial feature points such as the eyes, nose and mouth. However, the detector has difficulty extracting the feature points from several images, because images have different conditions such as size, color, brightness, etc. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an algorithm using a modified cascade facial feature point detector using a convolutional neural network. The structure of the convolution neural network is based on LeNet-5 of Yann LeCun. For input data of the convolutional neural network, outputs from a cascade facial feature point detector that have color and gray images were used. The images were resized to 32×32 . In addition, the gray images were made into the YUV format. The gray and color images are the basis for the convolution neural network. Then, we classified about 1,200 testing images that show subjects. This research found that the proposed method is more accurate than a cascade facial feature point detector, because the algorithm provides modified results from the cascade facial feature point detector."

It has been utilized in many industrial sectors such as credit scoring system, fraud detection system, customer relationship management, and decision making. Association rule, one of the well-established methods in data mining, finds the relationship between antecedent items and consequent items in a huge database. Evaluation criteria of association rules have been developed by many researchers. Among them, the Hellinger measure is the association threshold considering the information content and the generality of a rule. If we use the Hellinger measure for rule generation, we cannot determine the direction of the association. In this paper we proposed a adjusted Hellinger measure to compensate for this disadvantage, and we investigated some useful properties for this measure. And then we compared some various aspects through a few experiments. The results showed that the adjusted Hellinger measure was better than the Hellinger measure because it had the right direction of association."

Moreover, they believed that North Koreans could become “new men” by accepting the country’s scientific technology. They realized that creating a harmonious whole between machines and workers in high-tech factories was the ideal type of socialist society. However, due to the condition of North Korea, they tried to “make people scientific” by supplying and spreading scientific technologies.

Use of Word Clustering to Improve Emotion Recognition from Short Text,2016,"['Emotion recognition', 'Affective computing', 'Word clustering']",,"Emotion recognition is an important component of affective computing, and is significant in the implementation of natural and friendly human-computer interaction. An effective approach to recognizing emotion from text is based on a machine learning technique, which deals with emotion recognition as a classification problem. However, in emotion recognition, the texts involved are usually very short, leaving a very large, sparse feature space, which decreases the performance of emotion classification. This paper proposes to resolve the problem of feature sparseness, and largely improve the emotion recognition performance from short texts by doing the following: representing short texts with word cluster features, offering a novel word clustering algorithm, and using a new feature weighting scheme. Emotion classification experiments were performed with different features and weighting schemes on a publicly available dataset. The experimental results suggest that the word cluster features and the proposed weighting scheme can partly resolve problems with feature sparseness and emotion recognition performance."

The unit spherical surface centered on that point can be considered to accumulate the evidence of each angular tessellation. According to a kind of point area such as wall, ground, tree, car, and so on, the results of spherical signature description look so different each other. These data can be applied into the Deep Belief Nets, which is one of the Deep Neural Networks, for learning the environmental feature extractor.

Evaluation of soil-concrete interface shear strength based on LS-SVM,2016,"['soil-concrete interface shear strength', 'modified direct shear test', 'LS-SVM', 'statistical prediction']",,"The soil-concrete interface shear strength, although has been extensively studied, is still difficult to predict as a result of the dependence on many factors such as normal stresses, surface roughness, particle sizes, moisture contents, dilation angles of soils, etc. In this study, a well-known rigorous statistical learning approach, namely the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) realized in a ubiquitous spreadsheet platform is firstly used in estimating the soil-structure interface shear strength. Instead of studying the complicated mechanism, LS-SVM enables to explore the possible link between the fundamental factors and the interface shear strengths, via a sophisticated statistic approach. As a preliminary investigation, the authors study the expansive soils that are found extensively in most countries. To reduce the complexity, three major influential factors, e.g., initial moisture contents, initial dry densities and normal stresses of soils are taken into account in developing the LS-SVM models for the soil-concrete interface shear strengths. The predicted results by LS-SVM show reasonably good agreement with experimental data from direct shear tests."
Use of Word Clustering to Improve Emotion Recognition from Short Text,2016,"['Emotion recognition', 'Affective computing', 'Word clustering']",,"Emotion recognition is an important component of affective computing, and is significant in the implementation of natural and friendly human-computer interaction. An effective approach to recognizing emotion from text is based on a machine learning technique, which deals with emotion recognition as a classification problem. However, in emotion recognition, the texts involved are usually very short, leaving a very large, sparse feature space, which decreases the performance of emotion classification. This paper proposes to resolve the problem of feature sparseness, and largely improve the emotion recognition performance from short texts by doing the following: representing short texts with word cluster features, offering a novel word clustering algorithm, and using a new feature weighting scheme. Emotion classification experiments were performed with different features and weighting schemes on a publicly available dataset. The experimental results suggest that the word cluster features and the proposed weighting scheme can partly resolve problems with feature sparseness and emotion recognition performance."
RESEARCH : Open Access ; Comparison of three boosting methods in parent-offspring trios for genotype imputation using simulation study,2016,"['Trios', 'Boosting methods', 'Imputation accuracy', 'Computation time']",,"Background: Genotype imputation is an important process of predicting unknown genotypes, which uses reference population with dense genotypes to predict missing genotypes for both human and animal genetic variations at a low cost. Machine learning methods specially boosting methods have been used in genetic studies to explore the underlying genetic profile of disease and build models capable of predicting missing values of a marker. Methods: In this study strategies and factors affecting the imputation accuracy of parent-offspring trios compared from lower-density SNP panels (5 K) to high density (10 K) SNP panel using three different Boosting methods namely TotalBoost (TB), LogitBoost (LB) and AdaBoost (AB). The methods employed using simulated data to impute the un-typed SNPs in parent-offspring trios. Four different datasets of G1 (100 trios with 5 k SNPs), G2 (100 trios with 10 k SNPs), G3 (500 trios with 5 k SNPs), and G4 (500 trio with 10 k SNPs) were simulated. In four datasets all parents were genotyped completely, and offspring genotyped with a lower density panel. Results: Comparison of the three methods for imputation showed that the LB outperformed AB and TB for imputation accuracy. The time of computation were different between methods. The AB was the fastest algorithm. The higher SNP densities resulted the increase of the accuracy of imputation. Larger trios (i.e. 500) was better for performance of LB and TB. Conclusions: The conclusion is that the three methods do well in terms of imputation accuracy also the dense chip is recommended for imputation of parent-offspring trios."

Subset selection in multiple linear regression: An improved Tabu search,2016,"['Metaheuristics', 'Improved tabu search', 'Subset selection problem']",,"This paper proposes an improved tabu search method for subset selection in multiple linear regression models. Variable selection is a vital combinatorial optimization problem in multivariate statistics. The selection of the optimal subset of variables is necessary in order to reliably construct a multiple linear regression model. Its applications widely range from machine learning, time-series prediction, and multi-class classification to noise detection. Since this problem has NP-complete nature, it becomes more difficult to find the optimal solution as the number of variables increases. Two typical metaheuristic methods have been developed to tackle the problem: the tabu search algorithm and hybrid genetic and simulated annealing algorithm. However, these two methods have shortcomings. The tabu search method requires a large amount of computing time, and the hybrid algorithm produces a less accurate solution. To overcome the shortcomings of these methods, we propose an improved tabu search algorithm to reduce moves of the neighborhood and to adopt an effective move search strategy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, comparative studies are performed on small literature data sets and on large simulation data sets. Computational results show that the proposed method outperforms two metaheuristic methods in terms of the computing time and solution quality."

Fast Algorithm for Intra Prediction of HEVC Using Adaptive Decision Trees,2016,"['fast mode decisions', 'intra prediction', 'decision trees', 'offline training', 'HEVC']",,"High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Standard, as the latest coding standard, introduces satisfying compression structures with respect to its predecessor Advanced Video Coding (H.264/AVC). The new coding standard can offer improved encoding performance compared with H.264/AVC. However, it also leads to enormous computational complexity that makes it considerably difficult to be implemented in real time application. In this paper, based on machine learning, a fast partitioning method is proposed, which can search for the best splitting structures for Intra-Prediction. In view of the video texture characteristics, we choose the entropy of Gray-Scale Difference Statistics (GDS) and the minimum of Sum of Absolute Transformed Difference (SATD) as two important features, which can make a balance between the computation complexity and classification performance. According to the selected features, adaptive decision trees can be built for the Coding Units (CU) with different size by offline training. Furthermore, by this way, the partition of CUs can be resolved as a binary classification problem. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm can save over 34% encoding time on average, with a negligible Bjontegaard Delta (BD)-rate increase."

To verify the performance of LP text detection in natural images, we apply MB-LGP feature by combining with ensemble machine learning algorithm in purpose of selecting optimal features of small number in huge pool. The feature selection is performed by adaptive boosting algorithm that shows great performance in minimum false positive detection ratio and in computing time when combined with cascade approach.

Especially, non-constraint measurement of ECG makes it available to estimate various human health parameters such as heart rate. Additionally, non-constraint ECG measurement of wheelchair user provides real-time health parameter information for emergency response. For accurate emergency response with low false alarm rate, it is necessary to discriminate quality levels of ECG measured using non-constraint approach. Health parameters acquired from low quality ECG results in inaccurate information. Thus, in this study, a machine learning based approach for three-class classification of ECG quality level is suggested. Three sensors are embedded in the back seat, chest belt, and handle of automatic wheelchair. For the two sensors embedded in back seat and chest belt, capacitively coupled electrodes were used. The accuracy of quality level classification was estimated using Monte Carlo cross validation. The proposed approach demonstrated accuracy of 94.01%, 95.57%, and 96.94% for each channel of three sensors. Furthermore, the implemented algorithm enables classification of user posture by detection of contacted electrodes. The accuracy for posture estimation was 94.57%.

In general, long-term forecasting of power demand has been studied from both the consumer’s perspective and an econometrics model in the form of a generalized linear model with predictors. Time series techniques are used for short-term forecasting with no predictors as predictors must be predicted prior to forecasting response variables and containing estimation errors during this process is inevitable. In previous researches, seasonal exponential smoothing method, SARMA (Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average) with consideration to weekly pattern Neuron-Fuzzy model, SVR (Support Vector Regression) model with predictors explored through machine learning, and K-means clustering technique in the various approaches have been applied to short-term power supply forecasting. In this paper, SARMA and intervention model are fitted to forecast the maximum power load daily, weekly, and monthly by using the empirical data from 2011 through 2013. ARMA(2, 1, 2)(1, 1, 1)₇ and ARMA(0, 1, 1)(1, 1, 0)₁₂ are fitted respectively to the daily and monthly power demand, but the weekly power demand is not fitted by AREA because of unit root series.

In order to achieve successful catch-up of CoPS, we explored emerging technologies of CoPS, which are featured by the characteristics of radical novelty, relatively fast growth and self-sustaining, through the study of emerging technologies of gas turbine for power generation. We found that emerging technologies of the gas turbine are technologies for combustion nozzle and composition of electrical machine for increasing power efficiency, washing technology for particulate matter, cast and material processing technology for enhancing durability from fatigue, cooling technologies from extremely high temperature, interconnection operation technology between renewable energy and the gas turbine for flexibility in power generation, and big data technology for remote monitoring and diagnosis of the gas turbine.

Understanding spatial patterns of soil C is particularly limited for mountain areas. This study aims to predict the spatial pattern of soil C using terrain analysis in a steep mountainous area. Specifically, model performances and prediction uncertainties were investigated based on the number of resampling repetitions. Further, important predictors for soil C were also identified. Finally, the spatial distribution of uncertainty was analyzed. A total of 91 soil samples were collected via conditioned latin hypercube sampling and a digital soil C map was developed using support vector regression which is one of the powerful machine learning methods. Results showed that there were no distinct differences of model performances depending on the number of repetitions except for 10-fold cross validation. For soil C, elevation and surface curvature were selected as important predictors by recursive feature elimination. Soil C showed higher values in higher elevation and concave slopes. The spatial pattern of soil C might possibly reflect lateral movement of water and materials along the surface configuration of the study area. The higher values of uncertainty in higher elevation and concave slopes might be related to geomorphological characteristics of the research area and the sampling design. This study is believed to provide a better understanding of the relationship between geomorphology and soil C in the mountainous ecosystem."
Text Steganography Based on Ci-poetry Generation Using Markov Chain Model,2016,"['Steganography', 'Ci-poetry Generation', 'Markov Chain', 'Mutual Information']",,"Steganography based on text generation has become a hot research topic in recent years. However, current text-generation methods which generate texts of normal style have either semantic or syntactic flaws. Note that texts of special genre, such as poem, have much simpler language model, less grammar rules, and lower demand for naturalness. Motivated by this observation, in this paper, we propose a text steganography that utilizes Markov chain model to generate Ci-poetry, a classic Chinese poem style. Since all Ci poems have fixed tone patterns, the generation process is to select proper words based on a chosen tone pattern. Markov chain model can obtain a state transfer matrix which simulates the language model of Ci-poetry by learning from a given corpus. To begin with an initial word, we can hide secret message when we use the state transfer matrix to choose a next word, and iterating until the end of the whole Ci poem. Extensive experiments are conducted and both machine and human evaluation results show that our method can generate Ci-poetry with higher naturalness than former researches and achieve competitive embedding rate."

Thus, it is common to practice data-driven modeling techniques in these cases. Among them, most widely adopted techniques are regression model and intelligent model such as neural networks. Regression model has drawback showing lower performance when much non-linearity exists between input and output data. Intelligent model has been shown its superiority to the linear model due to ability capable of effectively estimate desired output in cases of both linear and nonlinear problem. This paper proposes modeling method of daily photovoltaic power systems using ELM(Extreme Learning Machine) based modular networks. The proposed method uses sub-model by fuzzy clustering rather than using a single model. Each sub-model is implemented by ELM. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed various experiments by dataset acquired during 2014 in real-plant."

Various research fields such as computer science and business management can take advantage of this feature to analyze customer-generated opinions.  In previous studies, the star rating of a review is regarded as the same as sentiment embedded in the text. However, it does not always correspond to the sentiment polarity. Due to this supposition, previous studies have some limitations in their accuracy. To solve this issue, the present study uses a supervised sentiment classification model to measure a more accurate sentiment polarity. This study aims to propose an advanced sentiment classifier and to discover the correlation between movie reviews and box-office success.  The advanced sentiment classifier is based on two supervised machine learning techniques, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Feedforward Neural Network (FNN). The sentiment scores of the movie reviews are measured by the sentiment classifier and are analyzed by statistical correlations between movie reviews and box-office success. Movie reviews are collected along with a star-rate. The dataset used in this study consists of 1,258,538 reviews from 175 films gathered from Naver Movie website (movie.naver.com).  The results show that the proposed sentiment classifier outperforms Naive Bayes (NB) classifier as its accuracy is about 6% higher than NB. Furthermore, the results indicate that there are positive correlations between the star-rate and the number of audiences, which can be regarded as the box-office success of a movie. The study also shows that there is the mild, positive correlation between the sentiment scores estimated by the classifier and the number of audiences. To verify the applicability of the sentiment scores, an independent sample t-test was conducted. For this, the movies were divided into two groups using the average of sentiment scores. The two groups are significantly different in terms of the star-rated scores."

Detecting Anatomical Landmarks for Fast Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis,2016,,,"<P>Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a very popular and effective technique used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). The success of computer-aided diagnosis methods using structural MRI data is largely dependent on the two time-consuming steps: 1) nonlinear registration across subjects, and 2) brain tissue segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a landmark-based feature extraction method that does not require nonlinear registration and tissue segmentation. In the training stage, in order to distinguish AD subjects from healthy controls (HCs), group comparisons, based on local morphological features, are first performed to identify brain regions that have significant group differences. In general, the centers of the identified regions become landmark locations (or AD landmarks for short) capable of differentiating AD subjects from HCs. In the testing stage, using the learned AD landmarks, the corresponding landmarks are detected in a testing image using an efficient technique based on a shape-constrained regression-forest algorithm. To improve detection accuracy, an additional set of salient and consistent landmarks are also identified to guide the AD landmark detection. Based on the identified AD landmarks, morphological features are extracted to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that is capable of predicting the AD condition. In the experiments, our method is evaluated on landmark detection and AD classification sequentially. Specifically, the landmark detection error (manually annotated versus automatically detected) of the proposed landmark detector is 2.41mm, and our landmark-based AD classification accuracy is 83.7%. Lastly, the AD classification performance of our method is comparable to, or even better than, that achieved by existing region-based and voxel-based methods, while the proposed method is approximately 50 times faster.</P>"

To predict corporate credit ratings better, various algorithms of machine learning have been proposed and applied. However, the algorithms have some limitations. First of all, they are unable to give a solution for which variables in the dataset should be considered as input variables to effectively predict a dependent variable. Also, they are easily exposed to overfitting and risk being affected by outliers and noise. In addition, they are required to tune their numerous parameters. Under this background, this study proposes the application of Random Forests(RF) to overcome the weakness of the traditional techniques. RF were designed by Leo Breiman, an American statistician and professor, and are an ensemble learning technique. This algorithm has both features originating from bagging algorithm, which is to extend a single decision tree to various decision trees, and from random input selection. The benefit of our proposed algorithm is free from an overfitting issue, and both noise and outliers in the dataset cannot have an effect on it. Thus, our model can yield high accuracy in forecasting corporate credit ratings. To validate the effectiveness of RF in predicting corporate credit ratings, we applied it to a real world dataset of corporate credit rating in Korea. The data that we used for this research consisted of various financial ratios of 1,295 corporations and their corporate credit ratings. To evaluate and compare our model with traditional methods, we used the following methods: MDA(Multiple Discriminant Analysis), ANN(Artificial Neural Network) and MSVM(Multiclass SVM). Each model’s performance was calculated by predictive accuracy based on training and validation.　Empirical results showed that RF outperforms other traditional methods from the perspective of prediction accuracy."
Visual Preference Assessment on Ultra-High-Definition Images,2016,,,"<P>With the recent evolution of ultra-high-definition (UHD) display technology, viewers can enjoy high-resolution content more realistically over TVs, virtual reality, portable, and wearable devices. To increase the visual attraction viewers perceive, post-processing of video content has been more powerfully conducted in such commercial devices. In this paper, we define a new terminology visual preference to quantify viewer perceptual preferences in a certain viewing environment with UHD images processed using sharpness and contrast enhancements. Viewers' visual preference for UHD images depends on the spatial resolution afforded by the UHD display, which in turn depends on the viewing geometry of the display resolution, display size, and viewing distance. In addition, viewers can perceive different degrees of quality and sharpness according to the content enhancement type and level, which leads to variation in the statistical dynamics of spatial image information. In this paper, we explore a novel methodology called the visual preference assessment model (VPAM) that accounts for content enhancement features, diverse viewing geometry, and statistical dynamics variation. The VPAM is a no-reference assessment method designed using an elaborate subjective preference assessment with support vector regression as the machine learning algorithm. The VPAM far outperforms previous methods in terms of correlation, 0.45-0.56, with the visual preference assessment.</P>"

Our experimental results showed that corrected pressure data are in regulation and our correcting method using SVR showed very good performance."
Multilevel Precision-Based Rational Design of Chemical Inhibitors Targeting the Hydrophobic Cleft of Toxoplasma gondii Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1),2016,"['apical membrane antigen 1', 'drug design', 'hydrophobic interaction', 'molecular docking analyses', 'rhoptry neck protein 2', 'toxoplasmosis']",,"Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular Apicomplexan parasite and a causative agent of toxoplasmosis in human. It causes encephalitis, uveitis, chorioretinitis, and congenital infection. T. gondii invades the host cell by forming a moving junction (MJ) complex. This complex formation is initiated by intermolecular interactions between the two secretory parasitic proteins-namely, apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2) and is critically essential for the host invasion process. By this study, we propose two potential leads, NSC95522 and NSC179676 that can efficiently target the AMA1 hydrophobic cleft, which is a hotspot for targeting MJ complex formation. The proposed leads are the result of an exhaustive conformational search-based virtual screen with multilevel precision scoring of the docking affinities. These two compounds surpassed all the precision levels of docking and also the stringent post docking and cumulative molecular dynamics evaluations. Moreover, the backbone flexibility of hotspot residues in the hydrophobic cleft, which has been previously reported to be essential for accommodative binding of RON2 to AMA1, was also highly perturbed by these compounds. Furthermore, binding free energy calculations of these two compounds also revealed a significant affinity to AMA1. Machine learning approaches also predicted these two compounds to possess more relevant activities. Hence, these two leads, NSC95522 and NSC179676, may prove to be potential inhibitors targeting AMA1-RON2 complex formation towards combating toxoplasmosis."

의료공간디자인 실무인재 양성을 위한 교육프로그램 연구-역량중심교육과정 개발 중심으로-,2016,"['Medical Space Design', 'Competency-Based', 'Curriculum', 'Health', 'Wellness', '의료공간디자인', '역량중심', '교육과정', '보건', '건강']",,"(Background and Purpose)The change in the level of importance of health for individuals is demanding regular and constant upgrades in the medical environment. Thus, medical organizations, from small medical clinics to hospitals, government medical provision centers, and Silver Towns, require professional medical environment designers to create new environments for rehabilitation and treatment spaces and construct modern structures with automatic systems. Therefore, a new education program for professional medical environment designers who are capable of maintaining and supervising medical facilities is necessary for the upcoming medical era. The following research suggests a change to the medical space design program, a study of design by combining studies of medicine and engineering, to extend students`` maximum capability to work as professional medical environment designers. (Method)First, aligned with changes to the domestic and foreign medical industry``s paradigm, early research and consideration of reference materials was conducted. Second, the specialized education programs of foreign education institutions, which have content about medical space design, were analyzed and advice from construction and interior designing companies with medical space design experience was requested to develop effective and innovative directions for the current specialized education system. Last, research was conducted on an education model that focuses on enhancing students`` executive ability to collect and analyze data and analyze. This process is critically helpful in creating an optimal education model for the medical space design program. (Results)The strategies of the medical space design program are as follows. First, to specialize the hands-on exercises at the actual work place to enable students to generate medical treatment and healing environments. Two tracks of space design and space management will be taught separately along with hands-on exercises for each track. One differentiated part of the program is that the students will learn how to structure medical space where medical equipment and machines can be utilized conveniently and effectively, and healthy healing space based on the value of environment friendliness. The students will be involved in medical space designing work in small and large hospitals and other medical organizations or medical treatment centers. Second, the space administration track is to train professionals who have problem solving skills to efficiently manage modern medical equipment and facilities that are frequently used in the new medical industry. In addition, the students will go through experience-based education by participating in medical space designing projects in collaboration with the university hospital. This enhances their capability to handle hands-on duties for better performance in their future careers. (Conclusions)In summary, the new field-base medical space design program intends to produce well-rounded designers who are capable of being allocated to field projects immediately following graduation. Participating in the program, along with hands-on projects of creating medical spaces for the university hospital and collecting related skills certificates, will be a milestone for students to reach their successful destinations and positions in society."

Three research goals of this study were first, exploration on the concept of big data based on the trend of contents business industry, second, survey and analysis on management of big data and development of analysis platforms and third, suggestion of platform to establish museum contents business model.  This study explored the concept of convergent contents and business within museums and analyzed development status of domestic and overseas big data management and analysis platforms. Based on this theoretical exploration, study analyzed constituting factors of museum contents business and, in order to suggest museum contents business model, study proposed signal library database verification model approach, high-precision hybrid prediction model development approach, heuristic prediction technology and algorithm realization model approach, service platform approach for prediction analysis and social media collection, storage and analysis technology model approach to develop a platform. Museum contents platform based on big data developed by this study was basically approached from signal analysis. Signal library database on art contents must be designed and development and verification on signal must be conducted. Next, high-precision hybrid prediction engine which fits art contents must be developed. Hybrid engine proceeds in the order of prediction technology based on machine learning, heuristic prediction technology based on logical rule and inter-convergent hybrid algorithm followed by development of service platform for prediction analysis and pilot test.  Since there is no study which suggested classification system and platform of museum contents business, this study will be a basic and fundamental study for art contents business. As demand for contents business model based on museum big data platform is predicted to rapidly increase in the future, more details studies are required and in-depth studies are required on contents license and consulting services as well."
