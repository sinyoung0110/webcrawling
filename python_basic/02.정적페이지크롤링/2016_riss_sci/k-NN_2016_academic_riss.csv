Previous research has been thoroughly reviewed for understanding fundamentals of k-NN algorithm that has been widely used for short-term traffic states prediction. The framework of this algorithm commonly includes historical data smoothing, pattern database, similarity measure, k-value, and prediction horizon. The outcomes of this study suggests that: i) historical data smoothing is recommended to reduce random noise of measured traffic data; ii) the historical database should contain traffic state information on both normal and event conditions; and iii) trial and error method can improve the prediction accuracy by better searching for the optimum input time series and k-value. The study results also demonstrates that predicted error increases with the duration of prediction horizon and rapidly changing traffic states."

The data related to the position of the moving train are monitored by the control center for trains and used widely for the safety and comfort of passengers. The train location tracking methods based on WiFi installed by telecom companies were evaluated. In this study, a simulator was developed to consider the environments of two cases; in already installed WiFi devices and new installed WiFi devices. The developed simulator can simulate the localized estimation of the position under a variety of conditions, such as the number of WiFi devices, the area of platform and entry velocity of train. To apply location tracking algorithms, a k-nn algorithm and fuzzy k-nn algorithm were applied selectively according to the underlying condition and also four distance measurement algorithms were applied to compare the error of location tracking.

Intelligent Traffic Prediction by Multi-sensor Fusion using Multi-threaded Machine Learning,2016,"['Intelligent transportation system', 'K-nearest neighbor', 'Naive bayes']",,"Estimation and analysis of traffic jams plays a vital role in an intelligent transportation system and advances safety in the transportation system as well as mobility and optimization of environmental impact. For these reasons, many researchers currently mainly focus on the brilliant machine learning-based prediction approaches for traffic prediction systems. This paper primarily addresses the analysis and comparison of prediction accuracy between two machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). Based on the fact that optimized estimation accuracy of these methods mainly depends on a large amount of recounted data and that they require much time to compute the same function heuristically for each action, we propose an approach that applies multi-threading to these heuristic methods. It is obvious that the greater the amount of historical data, the more processing time is necessary. For a real-time system, operational response time is vital, and the proposed system also focuses on the time complexity cost as well as computational complexity. It is experimentally confirmed that K-NN does much better than Naïve Bayes, not only in prediction accuracy but also in processing time. Multithreading- based K-NN could compute four times faster than classical K-NN, whereas multithreading - based Naïve Bayes could process only twice as fast as classical Bayes."
Strange meson production in Al+Al collisions at 1.9 A GeV,2016,,,"<P>The production of K+, K- and phi(1020) mesons is studied in Al+Al collisions at a beam energy of 1.9 A GeV which is close to or below the production threshold in NN reactions. Inverse slopes, anisotropy parameters, and total emission yields of K-+/- mesons are obtained. A comparison of the ratio of kinetic energy distributions of K- and K+ mesons to the HSD transport model calculations suggests that the inclusion of the in-medium modifications of kaon properties is necessary to reproduce the ratio. The inverse slope and total yield of phi mesons are deduced. The contribution to K- production from phi meson decays is found to be [17 +/- 3(stat)(-7)(+2) (syst)]%. The results are in line with the previous K-+/- and phi data obtained for different colliding systems at similar incident beam energies.</P>"

The particle composition of the jet-like correlation is determined using identified associated particles. The dependence of the conditional yield of the jet-like correlation on the trigger particle momentum, associated particle momentum, and centrality for correlations with unidentified trigger particles are presented. The neutral strange particle composition in jet-like correlations with unidentified charged particle triggers is not well described by PYTHIA.

For each harmonic n, a modified valence quark-number N-q scaling [plotting v(n){Psi(m)}/(N-q)(n/2) versus transverse kinetic energies (KET)/N-q] is observed to yield a single curve for all the measured particle species for a broad range of KET. A simultaneous blast-wave model fit to the observed v(n){Psi(m)}(p(T)) coefficients and published particle spectra identifies radial flow anisotropies rho(n){Psi(m)} and spatial eccentricities s(n){Psi(m)} at freeze-out. These are generally smaller than the initial-state participant-plane geometric eccentricities epsilon(n){Psi(PP)(m)} as also observed in the final eccentricity from quantum interferometry measurements with respect to the event plane.</P>"
A Similarity Study of Interactive Content-Based Image Retrieval Scheme for Classification of Breast Lesions,2016,,,"<P>To study the similarity between queries and retrieved masses, we design an interactive CBIR ( Content-based Image Retrieval) CADx ( Computer-aided Diagnosis) system using relevance feedback for the characterization of breast masses in ultrasound ( US) images based on radiologists' visual similarity assessment. The CADx system retrieves masses that are similar to query masses from a reference library based on six computer-extracted features that describe the texture, width-to-height, and posterior shadowing of the mass. The k-NN retrieval with Euclidean distance similarity measure and the Rocchio relevance feedback algorithm ( RRF) are used. To train the RRF parameters, the similarities of 1891 image pairs from 62 ( 31 malignant and 31 benign) masses are rated by 3 MQSA ( Mammography Quality Standards Act) radiologists using a 9-point scale ( 9= most similar). The best RRF parameters are chosen based on 3 observer experiments. For testing, 100 independent query masses ( 49 malignant and 51 benign) and 121 reference masses on 230 ( 79 malignant and 151 benign) images were collected. Three radiologists rated the similarity between the query masses and the computer-retrieved masses. Average similarity ratings without and with RRF were 5.39 and 5.64 for the training set and 5.78 and 6.02 for the test set, respectively. Average AUC values without and with RRF were, respectively, 0.86+/- 0.03 and 0.87+/- 0.03 for the training set and 0.91+/- 0.03 and 0.90+/- 0.03 for the test set. On average, masses retrieved using the CBIR system were moderately similar to the query masses based on radiologists' similarity assessments. RRF improved the similarity of the retrieved masses.</P>"
Operator decision support system for integrated wastewater management including wastewater treatment plants and receiving water bodies,2016,,,"<P>An operator decision support system (ODSS) is proposed to support operators of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in making appropriate decisions. This system accounts for water quality (WQ) variations in WWTP influent and effluent and in the receiving water body (RWB). The proposed system is comprised of two diagnosis modules, three prediction modules, and a scenario-based supporting module (SSM). In the diagnosis modules, the WQs of the influent and effluent WWTP and of the RWB are assessed via multivariate analysis. Three prediction modules based on the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, activated sludge model no. 2d (ASM2d) model, and QUAL2E model are used to forecast WQs for 3 days in advance. To compare various operating alternatives, SSM is applied to test various predetermined operating conditions in terms of overall oxygen transfer coefficient (Kla), waste sludge flow rate (Qw), return sludge flow rate (Qr), and internal recycle flow rate (Qir). In the case of unacceptable total phosphorus (TP), SSM provides appropriate information for the chemical treatment. The constructed ODSS was tested using data collected from Geumho River, which was the RWB, and S WWTP in Daegu City, South Korea. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed ODSS to provide WWTP operators with more objective qualitative and quantitative assessments of WWTP and RWB WQs. Moreover, the current study shows that ODSS, using data collected from the study area, can be used to identify operational alternatives through SSM at an integrated urban wastewater management level.</P>"

To achieve the goal, the phrasal words were extracted from the transcribed label scripts of the Seoul Corpus using Praat. Following this, the onsets, peaks, codas and syllable types of the phrasal words were analyzed using an R script. Results revealed that k0 was most frequently used as an onset in both orthographic and pronounced phrasal words. Also, aa was the most favored vowel in the Korean syllable peak with fewer phonological processes in its pronounced form. The total proportion of all diphthongs according to the frequency of the peaks in the orthographic phrasal words was 8.8%, which was almost double those found in the pronounced phrasal words. For the codas, nn accounted for 34.4% of the total pronounced phrasal words and was the varied form. From syllable type classification of the Corpus, CV appeared to be the most frequent type followed by CVC, V, and VC from the orthographic forms. Overall, the onsets were more prevalent in the pronunciation more than the codas. From the results, this paper concluded that an analysis of phoneme distribution and phonological processes in light of syllable structure can contribute greatly to the understanding of the phonology of spoken Korean."

Temperature- and Frequency-Dependent Dielectric Properties of Sol–Gel-Derived BaTiO3-NaNbO3 Solid Solutions,2016,,,"<P>A sol-gel-derived powder synthesis method has been used to prepare BaTiO3-NaNbO3 (BT-NN) solid-solution ceramic samples with various compositions. Fine and homogeneous complex perovskite ceramics were obtained at lower processing temperatures than used in conventional solid-state processing. The ferroelectric and relaxor ferroelectric properties of the sol-gel-synthesized (1 - x)BaTiO3-xNaNbO(3) [(1 - x)BT-xNN] ceramics in the wide composition range of 0 < x a parts per thousand currency sign 0.7 were extensively studied. Structural and dielectric characterization results revealed that a low level of NN addition (x = 0.04) to BT is sufficient to cause a continuous relaxor-to-ferroelectric transition, and the relaxor behavior was consistently observed at compositions with high NN content up to x = 0.7. A number of relaxor parameters including the Curie temperature, Burns temperature, freezing temperature, gamma, diffuseness parameter (delta), and activation energy were determined from the temperature and frequency dependency of the real part of the dielectric permittivity for various BT-NN compositions using the Curie-Weiss law and Vogel-Fulcher relationship. The systematic changes of these parameters with respect to composition indicate that a continuous crossover between BT-based relaxor and NN-based relaxor occurs at a composition near x = 0.4.</P>"
Beam-energy dependence of charge balance functions from Au + Au collisions at energies available at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider,2016,,,"<P>Balance functions have been measured in terms of relative pseudorapidity (Delta(eta)) for charged particle pairs at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider from Au + Au collisions at root s(NN) = 7.7 GeV to 200 GeV using the STAR detector. These results are compared with balance functions measured at the CERN Large Hadron Collider from Pb + Pb collisions at root s(NN) = 2.76 TeV by the ALICE Collaboration. The width of the balance function decreases as the collisions become more central and as the beam energy is increased. In contrast, the widths of the balance functions calculated using shuffled events show little dependence on centrality or beam energy and are larger than the observed widths. Balance function widths calculated using events generated by UrQMD are wider than the measured widths in central collisions and show little centrality dependence. The measured widths of the balance functions in central collisions are consistent with the delayed hadronization of a deconfined quark gluon plasma (QGP). The narrowing of the balance function in central collisions at root s(NN) = 7.7 GeV implies that a QGP is still being created at this relatively low energy.</P>"

On-chip micromanipulation using a magnetically driven micromanipulator with an acoustically oscillating bubble,2016,"['Microsurgery', 'Bubble dynamics', 'Cavitational microstreaming', 'Cell manipulation']",,"This paper presents a magnetically driven micromanipulator for biological and microscale (bio/micro-) object manipulation in a microfluidic chip. The proposed micromanipulator mainly consists of a gaseous bubble that functions as a gripping tool and twin permanent magnets allowing for two-dimensional (2D) motion control in an aqueous medium. First, the 2D motion control of the micromanipulator (horizontal, vertical, and rotational motions) was demonstrated by using an external magnetic controller attached to the bottom of the chip, capable of altering the interaction forces induced by twin magnets installed inside both the micromanipulator and controller. Second, the micro-object manipulation was separately tested with glass beads (100μm diameter) and steel balls (600μm diameter) using an acoustically oscillating bubble. When the bubble was acoustically excited around its natural frequency by a piezoactuator, the radiation force generated from it attracted neighboring objects. The capturing force generated from an acoustically excited bubble was indirectly measured using the glass beads in a mini-channel. The maximum capturing force occurring at the natural frequency of the bubble was approximately 390nN. Finally, the manipulation of the steel balls on a chip was achieved with the use of both the magnetic and acoustic actuation. This micromanipulation technique can be applied to cell manipulation, micro-assembly, etc., with the advantage of minimizing any contact damage through the use of the bubble."

We classified abnormal ECG using mean_NN (mean of heart rate), SD1/SD2 (geometrical feature of poincare HRV plot), SE (spectral entropy), pNN100 (percentage of a heart rate longer than 100 ms) affecting accurate classification among combined of linear and nonlinear features. We compared our proposed method with Neural Networks to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm. When we used the features extracted from the HRV as an input variable for classifier, random forest used only the most contributed variable for classification unlike the neural networks. The characteristics of random forest enable the dimensionality reduction of the input variables, increase a efficiency of classifier and can be obtained faster, 11.1% higher accuracy than the neural networks."
ForwardJ/ψproduction in U + U collisions at<sub>sNN</sub>=193GeV,2016,,,"<P>The invariant yields, dN/dy, for J/psi production at forward rapidity (1.2 < vertical bar y vertical bar < 2.2) in U + U collisions at root S-NN = 193 GeV have been measured as a function of collision centrality. The invariant yields and nuclear-modification factor R-AA are presented and compared with those from Au + Au collisions in the same rapidity range. Additionally, the direct ratio of the invariant yields from U + U and Au + Au collisions within the same centrality class is presented, and used to investigate the role of c (c) over bar coalescence. Two different parametrizations of the deformed Woods-Saxon distribution were used in Glauber calculations to determine the values of the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions in each centrality class, N-coll, and these were found to give significantly different Ncoll values. Results using N-coll values from both deformed Woods-Saxon distributions are presented. The measured ratios show that the J/psi suppression, relative to binary collision scaling, is similar in U + U and Au + Au for peripheral and midcentral collisions, but that J/psi show less suppression for the most central U + U collisions. The results are consistent with a picture in which, for central collisions, increase in the J/psi yield due to c (c) over bar coalescence becomes more important than the decrease in yield due to increased energy density. For midcentral collisions, the conclusions about the balance between c (c) over bar coalescence and suppression depend on which deformed Woods-Saxon distribution is used to determine N-coll.</P>"
Azimuthally anisotropic emission of low-momentum direct photons in Au + Au collisions at <sub>sNN</sub>=200 GeV,2016,,,"<P>The PHENIX experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured second- and third-order Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal distributions of direct photons emitted at midrapidity in Au + Au collisions at root S-NN = 200 GeV for various collision centralities.

These new results on nu(2) and nu(3), combined with previously published results on yields, are compared to model calculations that provide yields and asymmetries in the same framework. Those models are challenged to explain simultaneously the observed large yield and large azimuthal anisotropies.</P>"
