Fast Algorithm for Intra Prediction of HEVC Using Adaptive Decision Trees,2016,"['fast mode decisions', 'intra prediction', 'decision trees', 'offline training', 'HEVC']",,"High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Standard, as the latest coding standard, introduces satisfying compression structures with respect to its predecessor Advanced Video Coding (H.264/AVC). The new coding standard can offer improved encoding performance compared with H.264/AVC. However, it also leads to enormous computational complexity that makes it considerably difficult to be implemented in real time application. In this paper, based on machine learning, a fast partitioning method is proposed, which can search for the best splitting structures for Intra-Prediction. In view of the video texture characteristics, we choose the entropy of Gray-Scale Difference Statistics (GDS) and the minimum of Sum of Absolute Transformed Difference (SATD) as two important features, which can make a balance between the computation complexity and classification performance. According to the selected features, adaptive decision trees can be built for the Coding Units (CU) with different size by offline training. Furthermore, by this way, the partition of CUs can be resolved as a binary classification problem. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm can save over 34% encoding time on average, with a negligible Bjontegaard Delta (BD)-rate increase."
"ORIGINAL ARTICLE : Assessing Factors Linked with Ozone Exceedances in Seoul, Korea through a Decision Tree Algorithm",2016,"['Ozone', 'Exceedance', 'Decision tree algorithm', 'NO2', 'Control strategy']",,"Since prolonged exposure to elevated ozone (O3) concentrations is known to be harmful to human health, appropriate control strategies for ozone are needed for the non-attainment area such as Seoul, Korea. The goal of this research is to assess factors linked with the 1-hour ozone exceedance through a decision tree model. Since ozone is a secondary pollutant, lag times between ozone and explanatory variables for ozone formation are taken into account in the model to improve the accuracy of the simulation. Results show that while ozone concentrations of the previous day and NO2 concentrations in the morning are major drivers for ozone exceedances in the early afternoon, meteorology plays more important role for ozone exceedances in the late afternoon. Results also show that a selection of lag times between ozone and explanatory variables affect the accuracy of predicting 1-hour ozone exceedances. The result analyzed in this study can be used for developing control strategies of ozone in Seoul, Korea."
Decision tree-based data mining and rule induction for identifying hydrogeological parameters that influence groundwater pollution sensitivity,2016,"['Data mining', 'Groundwater pollution', 'Groundwater vulnerability', 'Trichloroethylene']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>This study aims to develop a new field-based approach that can estimate patterns of groundwater pollution sensitivity using data mining algorithms. Hydrogeological and pollution sensitivity data were collected from the Woosan Industrial Complex, Korea, which is a site contaminated by trichloroethylene (TCE). The proposed data mining algorithm procedure uses seven hydrogeological properties as input variables: depth to water, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, vadose zone media, and hydraulic conductivity. The observed TCE sensitivity was used as the target data. Initially, four data mining algorithms artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), case-based reasoning (CBR), and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) were tested. We found that the DT-based data mining and rule induction method shows better prediction accuracy and consistency than the other methods. We also used the ordinal pairwise partitioning (OPP) algorithm to improve the accuracy and consistency of the DT model. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis of the OPP-DT model indicated that the net recharge (R), soil media (S), and aquifer media (A) were the major hydrogeological factors that influence groundwater sensitivity to TCE at the site. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed model can provide more accurate and consistent estimates of groundwater vulnerability to TCE compared to the existing models.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  We use data mining method to estimate groundwater pollution vulnerability. </LI> <LI>  Applicability is measured using trichloroethylene and hydrogeological data. </LI> <LI>  Proposed method shows better correlation between input and target variables. </LI> <LI>  Proposed model can be used to predict groundwater vulnerability at unmeasured points. </LI> <LI>  Proposed method could be used in decision making process for environmental projects. </LI> </UL> </P>   <P><B>Graphical abstract</B></P>   <P>[DISPLAY OMISSION]</P>"

First, using principal component factor analysis, 23 perceived value items were divided into three factors. Second, after conducting K-means cluster analysis based on the three perceived value factor scores, three groups were categorized as “monetary and convenience advantages seeker,” “availability of products/services seeker,” and “personal security seeker.” Lastly, the results of the decision tree analysis indicated that there were statistically significant differences among the three groups in terms of both socio-demographic and travel-related profiles.

Detection of tropical cyclone genesis via quantitative satellite ocean surface wind pattern and intensity analyses using decision trees,2016,"['Tropical cyclone', 'Microwave sea surface wind', 'Dynamic pattern and intensity recognition', 'Machine learning']",,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Microwave remote sensing can be used to measure ocean surface winds, which can be used to detect tropical cyclone (TC) formation in an objective and quantitative way. This study develops a new model using WindSat data and a machine learning approach. Dynamic and hydrologic indices are quantified from WindSat wind and rainfall snapshot images over 352 developing and 973 non-developing tropical disturbances from 2005 to 2009. The degree of cyclonic circulation symmetry near the system center is quantified using circular variances, and the degree of strong wind aggregation (heavy rainfall) is defined using a spatial pattern analysis program tool called FRAGSTATS. In addition, the circulation strength and convection are defined based on the areal averages of wind speed and rainfall. An objective TC formation detection model is then developed by applying those indices to a machine-learning decision tree algorithm using calibration data from 2005 to 2007. Results suggest that the circulation symmetry and intensity are the most important parameters that characterize developing tropical disturbances. Despite inherent sampling issues associated with the polar orbiting satellite, a validation from 2008 to 2009 shows that the model produced a positive detection rate of approximately 95.3% and false alarm rate of 28.5%, which is comparable with the pre-existing objective methods based on cloud-pattern recognition.

Sparse Signal Recovery via Tree Search Matching Pursuit,2016,"['Compressive sensing', 'greedy algorithm', 'sparse recovery', 'tree pruning', 'tree search']",,"Recently, greedy algorithm has received much attention as a cost-effective means to reconstruct the sparse signals from compressed measurements. Much of previous work has focused on the investigation of a single candidate to identify the support (index set of nonzero elements) of the sparse signals. Well-known drawback of the greedy approach is that the chosen candidate is often not the optimal solution due to the myopic decision in each iteration. In this paper, we propose a tree search based sparse signal recovery algorithm referred to as the tree search matching pursuit (TSMP). Two key ingredients of the proposed TSMP algorithm to control the computational complexity are the pre-selection to put a restriction on columns of the sensing matrix to be investigated and the tree pruning to eliminate unpromising paths from the search tree. In numerical simulations of Internet of Things (IoT) environments, it is shown that TSMP outperforms conventional schemes by a large margin."
Which Bisphosphonate? It’s the Compliance!: Decision Analysis,2016,"['Diphosphonates', 'Fractures bone', 'Osteoporosis postmenopausal', 'Patient compliance']",,"Background: The best options of several bisphosphonates for prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women remain controversial. We determined which bisphosphonate provides better efficacy in prevention of osteoporotic fractures using a decision analysis tool, in terms of quality of life. Methods: A decision analysis model was constructed containing final outcome score and the probability of vertebral and hip fracture within 1 year. Final outcome was defined as health-related quality of life, and was used as an utility in the decision tree. Probabilities were obtained by literature review, and health-related quality of life was evaluated by consensus committee. A roll back tool was used to determine the best bisphosphonate, and sensitivity analysis was performed to compensate for decision model uncertainty. Results: The decision model favored bisphosphonate with higher compliance in terms of quality of life. In one-way sensitivity analysis, ibandronate was more beneficial than the others, when probability of compliance on ibandronate was above 0.589. Conclusions: In terms of quality of life, the decision analysis model showed that compliance was most important for patients in real world, regardless of type of bisphosphonate."

Urban Tree Canopy Classification Using Remote Sensing,2016,"['Decision Tree Classification', 'Green space', 'Object Oriented Classification', 'Urban ecosystem']",,"Tree canopy is a valuable component consisting of urban ecosystem. The purpose of this study was to classify urban tree canopy (UTC) by using high resolution imagery and object-oriented classification (OOC), which was used to classify the different land cover types. With an urban canopy mapping system based on OOC and Decision Tree Classification (DTC), a site mapping was carried out by merging spectral data of high resolution imagery. This methodological approach showed high classification accuracy to distinguish small patches and continuous UTC boundaries on the high resolution imagery. For shadow removal, decision tree classification with various environmental variables such as brightness channel and band combination could effectively work. Our proposed methodology can be successfully used for the assessment and restoration of fragmented urban ecosystem and offer an opportunity to obtain high classification accuracy for the distinction of UTC components in urban landscape areas."

Fast CU Partitioning Algorithm for HEVC Using an Online-Learning-Based Bayesian Decision Rule,2016,"['scene change detection', 'Bayesian decision rule', 'coding unit (CU) partitioning', 'fast mode decision', 'High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)']",,"<P>High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the state-of-the-art video coding standard. It adopts a hierarchical quad-tree-based coding unit (CU) partitioning structure that is flexible in various texture and motion characteristics of a video signal. However, the exhaustive partitioning process for finding optimal CU partitions requires a dramatic increase in computational complexity of the HEVC encoder compared with previous video coding standards. In this paper, a fast CU partitioning algorithm is proposed for HEVC encoder, which early on terminates the CU partitioning process based on the Bayesian decision rule using joint online and offline learning. An online learning method is first presented based on the minimum error Bayesian decision rule using a training picture selection method with scene change detection. Next, a joint online and offline learning method is presented, which additionally trains the loss of decision making of the proposed method based on the minimum risk Bayesian decision rule. The proposed method is implemented on an HEVC test software 15.0. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the computational complexity of HEVC encoder to 53.6% on an average with a 0.71% acceptable Bjontegaard delta bitrate loss in random access configuration. For other configurations, 48.4%, 48.5%, and 54.2% encoding time saving are obtained on an average for low delay, low delay-P, and all intra-configurations, respectively.</P>"

CU Depth Decision Based on FAST Corner Detection for HEVC Intra Prediction,2016,"['video coding', 'HEVC', 'intra prediction', 'FAST corner detection']",,"The High efficiency video coding (HEVC) is the newest video coding standard that achieves coding efficiency higher than previous video coding standards such as H.264/AVC. In intra prediction, the prediction units (PUs) are derived from a large coding unit (LCU) which is partitioned into smaller coding units (CUs) sizing from 8x8 to 64x64 in a quad-tree structure. As they are divided until having the minimum depth, Optimum CU splitting is selected in RDO (Rate Distortion Optimization) process. In this process, HEVC demands high computational complexity. In this paper, to reduce the complexity of HEVC, we propose a fast CU mode decision (FCDD) for intra prediction by using FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) corner detection. The proposed method reduces computational complexity with 53.73% of the computational time for the intra prediction while coding performance degradation with 0.7% BDBR is small compared to conventional HEVC."

Data(age ≥ 19 years; n = 7,161) from the 2009 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) were divided into 80% training and 20% testing splits. Multiple DTs were constructed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry(DEXA) measured BF% and anthropometrics and demographics variables in training split. A parsimony DT with the lowest risk estimate was selected. The accuracy of the chosen DT was evaluated by R<sup>2</sup> and root mean square error(RMSE) against BF% measured by DEXA in testing split. The best model for estimation of BF% was a DT consisting of 5 levels and 4 predictors(risk estimate = 13.98; # of terminal nodes = 21). BF% estimated by the DT accounted for 73% of the variation in criterion-measured BF% with a RMSE of 4.03%. The new model using DT analysis to estimate BF% had moderate R<sup>2</sup> and small RMSE in a national representative sample of Korean adults. In addition, BF% can be estimated much easier by following the DT map (i.e., flowchart) compared with other equation models."

Dependent variable was income sources and attributes toward the variable included economic activity, earned wage, house ownership, as well as the quality of life, which became independent variables. And then, the Decision-tree analysis were used to explain the cause of poverty while demographic variables used as control variables. Unlike findings from a logistic regressional analysis, the study results showed a hierarchical order of variables suggested in the hypothetical model. The results showed that economic independence played the key to determine poverty as those who worked and earned wage income from the labor market are much less likely to live out of poverty. However, those who are older than 76 and indicated a lower score at the life satisfaction are more likely to live under the poverty line. Policy related implications on the elderly population living alone were also discussed."

Three dimensions of ethical level are measured by evaluating an unethical business case, which are fairness, righteousness, and admissibility. Logistical collaboration between partner companies occurs in decision-making, information sharing, and benefit sharing. Unlike most statistical analysis in existing studies in SCM, we adopt the decision tree induction to see how the ethical level might help to increase the collaboration in supply chains. The analysis results indicate that ethics in fairness and admissibility works positively on the relationship between trust and collaboration. Those whose ethical levels are more sensitive and high showed stronger willingness to cooperate with supply chain partners."

Sort Filter Skyline (SFS) uses this strategy, but reduces the number of comparisons by calculating the entropy score of each tuple in advance. However, for large and high-dimensional database, the number of comparison in SFS significantly increases, which enlarges overall skyline computational time. In this paper, we propose to apply a decision tree approach to reduce the number of comparisons in skyline computation for large and high-dimensional data. More specifically, using decision tree approach, we generate the classification rules that can identify the tuples that are not capable of dominating the current input tuple and hence need not be considered during the comparison operation. We show the performance advantages of the proposed method through various experiments. We compare the number of comparisons and skyline computation time of the proposed method with the existing state-of-the-art methods."

Also, the process has been monitored in database in real time. Particularly, the data in the design step of the process have contributed to the product that customers have required through getting useful information from the data and reflecting them to the design of product. In this study, first,  characteristics and variables affecting to them in the data of the design step of the process were analyzed by decision tree to find out the relation between explanatory and target variables. Second, the tolerance of continuous variables influencing on the target variable primarily was shown by the application of algorithm of decision tree, C4.5. Finally, the target variable, loss, was calculated by a loss function of Taguchi and analyzed. In this paper, the general method that the value of continuous explanatory variables has been used intactly not to be transformed to the discrete value and new method that the value of continuous explanatory variables was divided into 3 categories were compared. As a result, first, the tolerance obtained from the new method was more effective in decreasing the target variable, loss, than general method. In addition, the tolerance levels for the continuous explanatory variables to be chosen of the major variables were calculated. In further research, a systematic method using decision tree of data mining needs to be developed in order to categorize continuous variables under various scenarios of loss function."

To this end, decision tree method was applied to identify influential factors on injury severity and compare characteristics of those factors between work zone and non-work zone. The results from the comparison show that the risk of severity was low when traffic volume and heavy vehicle ratio are high because the factors lower the overall section speed. On the other hand, when the traffic volume and the heavy vehicle ratio are low, the section speed increased and the tendency for high injury severity was confirmed. These findings are expected to help transportation planners and engineers understand which risk factors contribute more to severe injury in the work zones such that they can effectively prepare and implement safety countermeasures."

It is useful for making statistical decisions, for example, in medical, biology, and business management area. In this paper, we examine newly developed classification tree algorithms and compare them with real examples in medical study, and provide a guideline to select appropriate methods for data analysis. Methods: For the comparison, we used four clinical datasets from UCI (University of California, Irvine) repository. We divide each data to 2/3 training and 1/3 test data set. After fitting the models with various R packages (tree, rpart, party, evtree, CORElearn and randomForest), misclassification rates for training data and test data are calculated separately. Also, specificity and sensitivity are calculated for test data. This procedure is repeated 200 times and compare misclassification rates with one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD). Also, specificities and sensitivities are compared. Results: In every case, randomForest shows the best performance. For the single tree methods, the performance of methods is different in each data set. evtree show better performance than the other methods in most data sets. Most sensitivities in Breast Tissue and Dermatology data are quite large. rpart and ctree show very low specificity in Dermatology Data. Conclusions: Every method has its own characteristic and the performance depends on data. Our study shows that the best single tree methods are different in four example data and evtree shows slightly better performance than the other single tree methods in most data sets. randomForest always shows the best performance, mainly because of using a lot of trees instead of one tree."

To this end, the author analyzed data (n = 193) extracted from a cross-sectional study of 344 farrow-to-finish farms which was conducted between March and September 2014 aimed to explore swine disease status at farm level. Standardized questionnaires with information about basic demographical data and management practices were collected in each farm by on-site visit of trained veterinarians. For the classification of the data sets regarding biosecurity level as a dependent variable and predictor variables, Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) algorithm was applied for modeling classification tree. The statistics of misclassification risk was used to evaluate the fitness of the model in terms of prediction results. Categorical multivariate input data (40 variables) was used to construct a classification tree, and the target variable was biosecurity level dichotomized into low versus high.In general, the level of biosecurity was lower in the majority of farms studied, mainly due to the limited implementation of on-farm basic biosecurity measures aimed at controlling the potential introduction and transmission of swine diseases.The CHAID model illustrated the relative importance of significant predictors in explaining the level of biosecurity; maintenance of medical records of treatment and vaccination, use of dedicated clothing to enter the farm, installing fence surrounding the farm perimeter, and periodic monitoring of the herd using written biosecurity plan in place.The misclassification risk estimate of the prediction model was 0.145 with the standard error of 0.025, indicating that 85.5% of the cases could be classified correctly by using the decision rule based on the current tree. Although CHAID approach could provide detailed information and insight about interactions among factors associated with biosecurity level, further evaluation of potential bias intervened in the course of data collection should be included in future studies.In addition, there is still need to validate findings through the external dataset with larger sample size to improve the external validity of the current model."

For two given fault trees which are logically the same each other, the BDD generation time for the smaller fault tree is shorter. Contraction, absorption and extraction rule can be applied for the logically same, but smaller fault tree transformation. As the BDD conversion of fault tree is performed per gate, the aim of fault tree reduction is to reduce the number of gates and to simplify the repeated events. Formulation of fault tree reduction is obtained and three forms of fault tree reduction are recommended before the BDD conversion of fault trees in order to reduce the runtime. The fault tree of an derailment accident is calculated and it is shown that the reduction strategy can be used for huge fault trees in order to reduce conversion runtime in BDD generation."

Object Classification Method Using Dynamic Random Forests and Genetic Optimization,2016,"['Object Classification', 'Random Forest', 'Genetic Algorithm', 'Classifier Ensemble']",,"In this paper, we proposed the object classification method using genetic and dynamic random forest consisting of optimal combination of unit tree. The random forest can ensure good generalization performance in combination of large amount of trees by assigning the randomization to the training samples and feature selection, etc. allocated to the decision tree as an ensemble classification model which combines with the unit decision tree based on the bagging. However, the random forest is composed of unit trees randomly, so it can show the excellent classification performance only when the sufficient amounts of trees are combined. There is no quantitative measurement method for the number of trees, and there is no choice but to repeat random tree structure continuously. The proposed algorithm is composed of random forest with a combination of optimal tree while maintaining the generalization performance of random forest. To achieve this, the problem of improving the classification performance was assigned to the optimization problem which found the optimal tree combination. For this end, the genetic algorithm methodology was applied. As a result of experiment, we had found out that the proposed algorithm could improve about 3~5% of classification performance in specific cases like common database and self infrared database compare with the existing random forest. In addition, we had shown that the optimal tree combination was decided at 55~60% level from the maximum trees."
Predicting Stock Liquidity by Using Ensemble Data Mining Methods,2016,"['Stock liquidity', 'Data-mining', 'Ensemble methods', 'decision making']",,"In finance literature, stock liquidity showing how stocks can be cashed out in the market has received rich attentions from both academicians and practitioners. The reasons are plenty. First, it is known that stock liquidity affects significantly asset pricing. Second, macroeconomic announcements influence liquidity in the stock market. Therefore, stock liquidity itself affects investors' decision and managers' decision as well. Though there exist a great deal of literature about stock liquidity in finance literature, it is quite clear that there are no studies attempting to investigate the stock liquidity issue as one of decision making problems. In finance literature, most of stock liquidity studies had dealt with limited views such as how much it influences stock price, which variables are associated with describing the stock liquidity significantly, etc. However, this paper posits that stock liquidity issue may become a serious decision-making problem, and then be handled by using data mining techniques to estimate its future extent with statistical validity. In this sense, we collected financial data set from a number of manufacturing companies listed in KRX (Korea Exchange) during the period of 2010 to 2013. The reason why we selected dataset from 2010 was to avoid the after-shocks of financial crisis that occurred in 2008. We used Fn-GuidPro system to gather total 5,700 financial data set. Stock liquidity measure was computed by the procedures proposed by Amihud (2002) which is known to show best metrics for showing relationship with daily return. We applied five data mining techniques (or classifiers) such as Bayesian network, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, neural network, and ensemble method. Bayesian networks include GBN (General Bayesian Network), NBN (Naive BN), TAN (Tree Augmented NBN). Decision tree uses CART and C4.5. Regression result was used as a benchmarking performance. Ensemble method uses two types-integration of two classifiers, and three classifiers. Ensemble method is based on voting for the sake of integrating classifiers. Among the single classifiers, CART showed best performance with 48.2%, compared with 37.18% by regression. Among the ensemble methods, the result from integrating TAN, CART, and SVM was best with 49.25%. Through the additional analysis in individual industries, those relatively stabilized industries like electronic appliances, wholesale & retailing, woods, leather-bags-shoes showed better performance over 50%."

In psychology, there have been some previous researches studying the factors influencing romantic relationships. However, most of these researches were performed based on statistical analysis; thus they have limitations in analyzing complex non-linear relationships or rules based reasoning.  This research analyzes commitment and persistence in heterosexual involvement according to styles of loving using a datamining technique as well as statistical methods. In this research, we consider six different styles of loving - eros, ludus, stroge, pragma, mania and agape which influence romantic relationships between lovers, besides the factors suggested by the previous researches. These six types of love are defined by Lee (1977) as follows: eros is romantic, passionate love; ludus is a game-playing or uncommitted love; storge is a slow developing, friendship-based love; pragma is a pragmatic, practical, mutually beneficial relationship; mania is an obsessive or possessive love and, lastly, agape is a gentle, caring, giving type of love, brotherly love, not concerned with the self.  In order to do this research, data from 105 heterosexual couples were collected. Using the data, a linear regression method was first performed to find out the important factors associated with a commitment to partners. The result shows that satisfaction, eros and agape are significant factors associated with the commitment level for both male and female. Interestingly, in male cases, agape has a greater effect on commitment than eros. On the other hand, in female cases, eros is a more significant factor than agape to commitment. In addition to that, investment of the male is also crucial factor for male commitment.  Next, decision tree analysis was performed to find out the characteristics of high commitment couples and low commitment couples. In order to build decision tree models in this experiment, decision tree operator in the datamining tool, Rapid Miner was used. The experimental result shows that males having a high satisfaction level in relationship show a high commitment level. However, even though a male may not have a high satisfaction level, if he has made a lot of financial or mental investment in relationship, and his partner shows him a certain amount of agape, then he also shows a high commitment level to the female. In the case of female, a women having a high eros and satisfaction level shows a high commitment level. Otherwise, even though a female may not have a high satisfaction level, if her partner shows a certain amount of mania then the female also shows a high commitment level.  Finally, this research built a prediction model to establish whether the relationship will persist or break up using a decision tree. The result shows that the most important factor influencing to the break up is a narcissistic tendency of the male. In addition to that, satisfaction, investment and mania of both male and female also affect a break up. Interestingly, while the mania level of a male works positively to maintain the relationship, that of a female has a negative influence.  The contribution of this research is adopting a new technique of analysis using a datamining method for psychology. In addition, the results of this research can provide useful advice to couples for building a harmonious relationship with each other.  This research has several limitations. First, the experimental data was sampled based on oversampling technique to balance the size of each classes. Thus, it has a limitation of evaluating performances of the predictive models objectively.

Decision tree analysis was applied in data mining techniques to develop estimation models for turbidity changes in the water supply system. The pH and residual chlorine dataset was used as variables of the turbidity estimation model. As a result, the case of applying both variables(pH and residual chlorine) were shown more reasonable estimation results than models only using each variable. However, the estimation model developed in this study were shown to have underestimated predictions for the peak observed values. To overcome this disadvantage, a high-pass filter method was introduced as a pretreatment of estimation model. Modified model using high-pass filter method showed more exactly predictions for the peak observed values as well as improved prediction performance than the conventional model."

In the big data age, there are too many information sources to refer to when making decisions. For example, when considering travel to a city, a person may search reviews from a search engine such as Google or social networking services (SNSs) such as blogs, Twitter, and Facebook. The emotional polarity of positive and negative reviews helps a user decide on whether or not to make a trip. Sentiment analysis of customer reviews has become an important research topic as datamining technology is widely accepted for text mining of the Web. Sentiment analysis has been used to classify documents through machine learning techniques, such as the decision tree, neural networks, and support vector machines (SVMs). is used to determine the attitude, position, and sensibility of people who write articles about various topics that are published on the Web. Regardless of the polarity of customer reviews, emotional reviews are very helpful materials for analyzing the opinions of customers through their reviews. Sentiment analysis helps with understanding what customers really want instantly through the help of automated text mining techniques. Sensitivity analysis utilizes text mining techniques on text on the Web to extract subjective information in the text for text analysis. Sensitivity analysis is utilized to determine the attitudes or positions of the person who wrote the article and presented their opinion about a particular topic.  In this study, we developed a model that selects a hot topic from user posts at Chinas online stock forum by using the k-means algorithm and self-organizing map (SOM). In addition, we developed a detecting model to predict a hot topic by using machine learning techniques such as logit, the decision tree, and SVM. We employed sensitivity analysis to develop our model for the selection and detection of hot topics from China’s online stock forum. The sensitivity analysis calculates a sentimental value from a document based on contrast and classification according to the polarity sentimental dictionary (positive or negative).  The online stock forum was an attractive site because of its information about stock investment. Users post numerous texts about stock movement by analyzing the market according to government policy announcements, market reports, reports from research institutes on the economy, and even rumors. We divided the online forum’s topics into 21 categories to utilize sentiment analysis. One hundred forty-four topics were selected among 21 categories at online forums about stock. The posts were crawled to build a positive and negative text database. We ultimately obtained 21,141 posts on 88 topics by preprocessing the text from March 2013 to February 2015. The interest index was defined to select the hot topics, and the k-means algorithm and SOM presented equivalent results with this data. We developed a decision tree model to detect hot topics with three algorithms: CHAID, CART, and C4.5. The results of CHAID were subpar compared to the others. We also employed SVM to detect the hot topics from negative data. The SVM models were trained with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel function by a grid search to detect the hot topics.  The detection of hot topics by using sentiment analysis provides the latest trends and hot topics in the stock forum for investors so that they no longer need to search the vast amounts of information on the Web. Our proposed model is also helpful to rapidly determine customers’ signals or attitudes towards government policy and firms’ products and services."

NOVEL LARGE SCALE SIMULATION PROCESS TO SUPPORT DOT’S CAFE MODELING SYSTEM,2016,"['Large scale simulation', 'Hybrid vehicles', 'CAFE', 'High performance computing', 'Autonomie']",,"This paper demonstrates a new process that has been specifically designed for the support of the U.S.Department of Transportation’s (DOT’s) Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. In developing the standards, DOT’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration made use of the CAFE Compliance and Effects Modeling System (the “Volpe model” or the “CAFE model”), which was developed by DOT’s Volpe National Transportation Systems Center for the 2005–2007 CAFE rulemaking and has been continuously updated since. The model is the primary tool used by the agency to evaluate potential CAFE stringency levels by applying technologies incrementally to each manufacturer’s fleet until the requirements under consideration are met. The Volpe model relies on numerous technology-related and economic inputs, such as market forecasts, technology costs, and effectiveness estimates; these inputs are categorized by vehicle classification, technology synergies, phase-in rates, cost learning curve adjustments, and technology “decision trees”. Part of the model’s function is to estimate CAFE improvements that a given manufacturer could achieve by applying additional technology to specific vehicles in its product line. A significant number of inputs to the Volpe decision-tree model are related to the effectiveness (fuel consumption reduction) of each fuel-saving technology. Argonne National Laboratory has developed a fullvehicle simulation tool named Autonomie, which has become one of the industry’s standard tools for analyzing vehicle energy consumption and technology effectiveness. Full-vehicle simulation tools use physics-based mathematical equations, engineering characteristics (e.g., engine maps, transmission shift points, and hybrid vehicle control strategies), and explicit drive cycles to predict the effectiveness of individual and combined fuel-saving technologies. The Large-Scale Simulation Process accelerates and facilitates the assessment of individual technological impacts on vehicle fuel economy. This paper will show how Argonne efficiently simulates hundreds of thousands of vehicles to model anticipated future vehicle technologies."
Practice of causal inference with the propensity of being zero or one: assessing the effect of arbitrary cutoffs of propensity scores,2016,"['causal inference', 'propensity score', 'positivity assumption', 'classification and regression tree', 'jackknife resampling', 'inverse propensity weighting', 'random forest']",,"Causal inference methodologies have been developed for the past decade to estimate the unconfounded effect of an exposure under several key assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the stable unit treatment value assumption, the strong ignorability of treatment assignment assumption, and the assumption that propensity scores be bounded away from zero and one (the positivity assumption). Of these assumptions, the first two have received much attention in the literature. Yet the positivity assumption has been recently discussed in only a few papers. Propensity scores of zero or one are indicative of deterministic exposure so that causal effects cannot be defined for these subjects. Therefore, these subjects need to be removed because no comparable comparison groups can be found for such subjects. In this paper, using currently available causal inference methods, we evaluate the effect of arbitrary cutoffs in the distribution of propensity scores and the impact of those decisions on bias and efficiency. We propose a tree-based method that performs well in terms of bias reduction when the definition of positivity is based on a single confounder. This tree-based method can be easily implemented using the statistical software program, R. R code for the studies is available online."

Lack of accuracy and validity of the Korean Diagnosis Related Group and Korean Out-Patient Group for the acute patients as the case-mix and payment tool for rehabilitation inpatients have been problematic issues. The objective of the study was to develop the Korean Rehabilitation Patient Group (KRPG) reflecting the characteristics of rehabilitation inpatients. Methods: As a retrospective medical record survey regarding rehabilitation inpatients, 4,207 episodes were collected through 42 hospitals. Considering the opinions of clinical experts and the decision-tree analysis, the variables for the KRPG system demonstrating the characteristics of rehabilitation inpatients were derived, and the splitting standards of the relevant variables were also set. Using the derived variables, we have drawn the rehabilitation inpatient classification model reflecting the clinical situation of Korea. The performance evaluation was conducted on the KRPG system. Results: The KRPG was targeted at the inpatients with brain or spinal cord injury. The etiologic disease, functional status (cognitive function, activity of daily living, muscle strength, spasticity, level and grade of spinal cord injury), and the patient`s age were the variables in the rehabilitation patients. The algorithm of KRPG system after applying the derived variables and total 204 rehabilitation patient groups were developed. The KRPG explained 11.8% of variance in charge for rehabilitation inpatients. It also explained 13.8% of variance in length of stay for them. Conclusion: The KRPG version 1.0 reflecting the clinical characteristics of rehabilitation inpatients was classified as 204 groups."
Transarterial chemoembolization versus resection for intermediate-stage (BCLC B) hepatocellular carcinoma,2016,"['Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Intermediate stage', 'Transarterial chemoembolization', 'Resection', 'Survival']",,"Background/Aims: Several studies have suggested that surgical resection (SR) can provide a survival benefit over transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the intermediate stage according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. However, the criteria for SR remain to be determined. This study compared the long-term outcome of intermediate-stage HCC patients treated by either TACE or SR as a primary treatment modality, with the aim of identifying the patient subgroup that gained a survival benefit by either modality. Methods: In total, 277 BCLC intermediate-stage HCC patients treated by either TACE (N=225) or SR (N=52) were analyzed. Results: The overall median survival time was significantly better for SR than TACE (61 vs. 30 months, P=0.002). Decision-tree analysis divided patients into seven nodes based on tumor size and number, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, and Child-Pugh score, and these were then simplified into four subgroups (B1.B4) based on similarities in the overall hazard rate. SR provided a significant survival benefit in subgroup B2, characterized by ‘oligo’ (2.4) nodules of intermediate size (5.10 cm) when the AFP levels was <400 ng/ml, or ‘oligo’ (2.4) nodules of small to intermediate size (<10 cm) plus a Child-Pugh score of 5 when the AFP level was ≥400 ng/mL (median survival 73 vs. 28 months for SR vs. TACE respectively; P=0.014). The survival rate did not differ significantly between SR and TACE in the other subgroups (B1 and B3). Conclusions: SR provided a survival benefit over TACE in intermediate-stage HCC, especially for patients meeting certain criteria. Re-establishing the criteria for optimal treatment modalities in this stage of HCC is needed to improve survival rates. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2016;22:250-258)"
Real time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environments,2016,,,"<P>In recent years, the number of people using the Internet and network services is increasing day by day. On a daily basis, a large amount of data is generated over the Internet from zeta byte to petabytes with a very high speed. On the other hand, we see more security threats on the network, the Internet, websites, and the enterprise network. Therefore, detecting intrusion in such ultra-high-speed environment in real time is a challenging task. Many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are proposed for various types of network attacks using machine learning approaches. Most of them are unable to detect recent unknown attacks, whereas the others do not provide a real-time solution to overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environment using Hadoop implementation. The proposed system includes four-layered IDS architecture, which consists of the capturing layer, filtration and load balancing layer, processing or Hadoop layer, and the decision-making layer. Furthermore, feature selection scheme is proposed that selects nine parameters for classification using (FSR) and (BER), as well as from the analysis of DARPA datasets. In addition, five major machine learning approaches are used to evaluate the proposed system including J48, REPTree, random forest tree, conjunctive rule, support vector machine, and Na < ve Bayes classifiers. Results show that among all these classifiers, REPTree and J48 are the best classifiers in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency. The proposed system architecture is evaluated with respect to accuracy in terms of true positive (TP) and false positive (FP), with respect to efficiency in terms of processing time and by comparing results with traditional techniques. It has more than 99 % TP and less than 0.001 % FP on REPTree and J48. The system has overall higher accuracy than existing IDSs with the capability to work in real time in ultra-high-speed big data environment.</P>"

Furthermore, the research aimed to suggest the reason for developing customized solutions to respond properly to the various situation and features of each individuals. As a result of the Decision Tree Analysis, the degree of depression affects the suicidal risk of elderly, and the degree of satisfaction to the housing environment is a important predictive factor following the degree of depression. Also, when the elderly who suffer from the depression with low level of satisfaction to the housing environment is not satisfied with the leisure, the risk of suicide increase. Moreover, the group retaining highest risk of suicide is featured by following factors: high degree of depression, low degree of housing and leisure satisfaction, and low satisfaction of the relation with children. Nextly, according to the result of Logistic Analysis, depression, gender, satisfaction of relationship with spouse, satisfaction of relationship with children and leisure satisfaction affect the elderly suicidal risk significantly. Lastly, as a result of Artificial Neural Network Analysis, one hidden layer and three hidden nodes were identified. The Decision Tree Analysis was identified as a better model for detecting and predicting factors affecting the elderly suicidal risk, because it shows lower misclassification rate compared to the Logistic Analysis and Artificial Neural Network Analysis. However, Logistic Analysis and Artificial Neural Network Analysis have better ROC indices compared to the ROC index of Decision Tree Analysis.

For doing so, analyses were made by objecting results of 779 games having been progressed for 2 years from 2013 to 2014 through nationwide 5 matches of middle & high school male-female basketball tournaments. As a result of analyzing decision tree analysis, adopted factors from male middle school and female high school matches were filed goal and free throw among 6 factors, and was field goal in female middle school matches. The adopted factor in male high school matches was rebound, field goal, and assist. The highest winning probability was 94.2% when exceeding 43 rebounds and 5 assists, and this shows the importance of rebound and assist and winning probability when interaction is matched. The lowest winning probability was 10.9% when lowering 26 rebounds, and it indicates the importance of rebound.  In conclusion, there were differences by gender and school type, but field goal, free throw, rebound, assist among 6 factors of middle& high school basketball matches appeared to important factors for victory statistically. Also, differences by school type were shown because growth of middle school players was not perfect compared to high school players. In training middle school players, practices on field goal, free throw, rebound, assist are required, and it is necessary to foster responsibility on ball ownership so as to prevent from intercept. Also it is necessary to teach the importance of assist and defense as the game nears to the final match since ability differences by team are not displayed largely in the final matches of male middle& high school players."

In this research, the relationship to the various operational variables and influent factors was explored using correlation analysis and decision tree algorithm. Due to the non-linear characteristics of the process, it was difficult to find clear linear patterns through correlation analysis. However, decision tree algorithm showed its usefulness in uncovering hidden patterns that consume energy. As operational factors, influent flowrate, the amount of aeration, nitrate recycling pumping rate, and sludge wasting pumping rate were selected as important factors. For environmental factors associated with influent compositions and removal rate, BOD and T-N removal rate were selected as significant factors."

Therefore, 4 predictive models were analyzed and the results of each model are as follows. First, determinants of batters’ salary in accordance with the last year (2014) performance were batting average, base hit, and career. Determinants in accordance with the career performance were the number of game play, base hit, and batting average. Second, determinants of pitchers’ salary according to the last year (2014) performance were career, ERA, and strikeout. Also, determinants according to the career performance were ERA, win, and the number of game play. Compared with the results of previous studies, point (difference or specificity) noted in this study are major players batting over 0.257. They were re-separated from base hit 173.5 and long-distance hits can be interpreted as a key variable determining high salary among the high average hitter. The ERA was the same in determinants of pitchers’ salary according to the last year( 2014) and career performance. But, they were separated from different criteria. It also means that the evaluation standard for the performance of the players in the salary negotiation process varies depending on the last year and career performance.

Temporal Search Algorithm for Multiple-Pedestrian Tracking,2016,"['tracking', 'search algorithm', 'machine learning', 'point correspondence', 'decision tree']",,"In this paper, we provide a trajectory-generation algorithm that can identify pedestrians in real time. Typically, the contours for the extraction of pedestrians from the foreground of images are not clear due to factors including brightness and shade; furthermore, pedestrians move in different directions and interact with each other. These issues mean that the identification of pedestrians and the generation of trajectories are somewhat difficult. We propose a new method for trajectory generation regarding multiple pedestrians. The first stage of the method distinguishes between those pedestrian-blob situations that need to be merged and those that require splitting, followed by the use of trained decision trees to separate the pedestrians. The second stage generates the trajectories of each pedestrian by using the point-correspondence method; however, we introduce a new point-correspondence algorithm for which the A* search method has been modified. By using fuzzy membership functions, a heuristic evaluation of the correspondence between the blobs was also conducted. The proposed method was implemented and tested with the PETS 2009 dataset to show an effective multiple-pedestrian-tracking capability in a pedestrian-interaction environment."

Recent studies attempt to combine those two methods to maximize advantagesand to minimize disadvantages both of misuse and anomaly. The combination is called Hybrid IDS. Previous studies would not be inappropriate for near real-time network environments because they have computational complexity problems. It leads to the need of the study considering the structure of IDS that have high detection rate and low computational cost. In this paper, we proposed a Hybrid IDS which combines C4.5 decision tree(misuse detection method) and Weighted K-means algorithm (anomaly detection method) hierarchically.

Where the subsequent production of the item is voluntary, then the connection between the primary violation and the item produced may be regarded as broken or attenuated(an exception to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine). However, the subsequent production could be caused by threatening or actually coerced by the law enforcement agencies. Therefore the 2016 decision required the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the production was conducted voluntarily by the possessor or custodian. Otherwise the item shall not be admissible. In the 2016 decision, the Supreme Court found that the prosecution failed to prove the voluntariness of the production, so the Court regarded the submission of the item as illegal and inadmissible to the trial. This decision is thought to be the first judgment that denies the voluntariness of a production of Art. 218. In addition, the Court put the standard of the proof beyond a reasonable doubt concerning the voluntary character of the production to attenuate or break the connection of the primary illegal seizure. The holding of the decision seems to be appropriate to prevent the possible threat or coercion of the prosecution or the police to the owner, possessor, or custodian of an evidence. In addition, it would be important to differentiate a standard of proof(proof beyond a reasonable doubt, probability proof, etc) and a method of proof."

This paper applied the learning effect to the repeated activities in a small sized apartment construction project. The result showed that there was about 10 percent of difference in duration (one approach of the total duration with learning effects in 41 days while the other without learning effect in 36.5 days). To make the comparison between the two approaches, a large number of BIM based computer simulations were generated and useful patterns were recognized using machine learning algorithm named Decision Tree (See5).

How to Define the Content of a Job-Specific Worker's Health Surveillance for Hospital Physicians?,2016,"['hospital physicians', 'occupational health strategy', 'patient safety', 'prevention', ""worker's health surveillance""]",,"Background: A job-specific Worker's Health Surveillance (WHS) for hospital physicians is a preventive occupational health strategy aiming at early detection of their diminished work-related health in order to improve or maintain physician's health and quality of care. This study addresses what steps should be taken to determine the content of a job-specific WHS for hospital physicians and outlines that content. Methods: Based on four questions, decision trees were developed for physical and psychological job demands and for biological, chemical, and physical exposures to decide whether or not to include work-related health effects related to occupational exposures or aspects of health reflecting insufficient job requirements. Information was gathered locally through self-reporting and systematic observations at the workplace and from evidence in international publications.

Improvised methods for tackling big data stream mining challenges: case study of human activity recognition,2016,,,"<P>Big data stream is a new hype but a practical computational challenge founded on data streams that are prevalent in applications nowadays. It is quite well known that data streams that are originated and collected from monitoring sensors accumulate continuously to a very huge amount making traditional batch-based model induction algorithms infeasible for real-time data mining or just-in-time data analytics. In this position paper, following a new data stream mining methodology, namely stream-based holistic analytics and reasoning in parallel (SHARP), a list of data analytic challenges as well as improvised methods are looked into. In particular, two types of decision tree algorithms, batch-mode and incremental-mode, are put under test at sensor data that represents a typical big data stream. We investigate whether and to what extent of two improvised methods-outlier removal and balancing imbalanced class distributions-affect the prediction performance in big data stream mining. SHARP is founded on incremental learning which does not require all the training to be loaded into the memory. This important fundamental concept needs to be supported not only by the decision tree algorithms, but by the other improvised methods usually at the preprocessing stage as well. This paper sheds some light into this area which is often overlooked by data analysts when it comes to big data stream mining.</P>"

However, it gradually has become difficult to collect the demographics of Internet users because their activities are anonymous in many cases. Although the marketing department is able to get the demographics using online or offline surveys, these approaches are very expensive, long processes, and likely to include false statements. Clickstream data is the recording an Internet user leaves behind while visiting websites. As the user clicks anywhere in the webpage, the activity is logged in semi-structured website log files. Such data allows us to see what pages users visited, how long they stayed there, how often they visited, when they usually visited, which site they prefer, what keywords they used to find the site, whether they purchased any, and so forth. For such a reason, some researchers tried to guess the demographics of Internet users by using their clickstream data. They derived various independent variables likely to be correlated to the demographics. The variables include search keyword, frequency and intensity for time, day and month, variety of websites visited, text information for web pages visited, etc. The demographic attributes to predict are also diverse according to the paper, and cover gender, age, job, location, income, education, marital status, presence of children. A variety of data mining methods, such as LSA, SVM, decision tree, neural network, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors, were used for prediction model building. However, this research has not yet identified which data mining method is appropriate to predict each demographic variable. Moreover, it is required to review independent variables studied so far and combine them as needed, and evaluate them for building the best prediction model. The objective of this study is to choose clickstream attributes mostly likely to be correlated to the demographics from the results of previous research, and then to identify which data mining method is fitting to predict each demographic attribute. Among the demographic attributes, this paper focus on predicting gender, age, marital status, residence, and job. And from the results of previous research, 64 clickstream attributes are applied to predict the demographic attributes. The overall process of predictive model building is compose of 4 steps. In the first step, we create user profiles which include 64 clickstream attributes and 5 demographic attributes. The second step performs the dimension reduction of clickstream variables to solve the curse of dimensionality and overfitting problem. We utilize three approaches which are based on decision tree, PCA, and cluster analysis. We build alternative predictive models for each demographic variable in the third step. SVM, neural network, and logistic regression are used for modeling. The last step evaluates the alternative models in view of model accuracy and selects the best model. For the experiments, we used clickstream data which represents 5 demographics and 16,962,705 online activities for 5,000 Internet users. IBM SPSS Modeler 17.0 was used for our prediction process, and the 5-fold cross validation was conducted to enhance the reliability of our experiments. As the experimental results, we can verify that there are a specific data mining method well-suited for each demographic variable. For example, age prediction is best performed when using the decision tree based dimension reduction and neural network whereas the prediction of gender and marital status is the most accurate by applying SVM without dimension reduction. We conclude that the online behaviors of the Internet users, captured from the clickstream data analysis, could be well used to predict their demographics, thereby being utilized to the digital marketing."
Mining Based Urban Climate Disaster Index Service According to Potential Risk,2016,,,"<P>As weather observation technology develops, natural disasters such as typhoon, earthquake, and heavy snow can be easily monitored as well as basic weather elements such as temperature, precipitation, wind, and air pressure. Advanced IT enables the statistical analysis of weather information and converged weather service. A variety of studies are being performed to analyze and utilize weather, temperature, humidity, etc. by using these IT convergence technology and weather observation technology. Meteorological Administration develops and provides the weather index to help the daily life of people by using weather elements. Influence of weather on life, industry and health is calculated by using indexes to provide weather index service. The weather index services are classified into life weather index, industry weather index and health weather index according to use. Weather indexes are correlated to each other as they are calculated by using common weather elements and advanced weather index service can be provided by analyzing these association patterns. The conventional service shows difference from the actual weather situation around the user as it is calculated by using weather information measured at the observation points. To improve this, personalized service can be provided by using context information-based ontology modeling and reasoning engine. This paper intends to propose a mining-based urban climate disaster index service according to potential risk. The proposed method constructs XML files provided by Meteorological Administration and Open Data Portal in the form of a tree by using the DOM parser and preprocesses it. Emerging risks are selected among socially important issues by using disaster-related keywords and early detected by using the previously developed WebBot. The collected weather indexes are normalized to construct weather index transactions. FP-Tree for mining is used to construct the weather index frequent pattern tree and extract association sets. Natural disaster risk, social disaster risk, and life safety risk are calculated from the extracted association sets. Urban climate disaster index is calculated by considering common elements among potential risks, weather information, disaster information, and emerging risk. Experimental application is tried to develop and verify its logical validity and effectiveness of urban climate disaster index monitoring. Therefore, urban climate disaster index service detects, predicts, and analyzes the trend of various risks such as disasters and safety accidents. It is also used for decision in disaster management in order to determine risks based on natural, man-made, and social disasters and predict future progress and direction of spread.</P>"

To predict corporate credit ratings better, various algorithms of machine learning have been proposed and applied. However, the algorithms have some limitations. First of all, they are unable to give a solution for which variables in the dataset should be considered as input variables to effectively predict a dependent variable. Also, they are easily exposed to overfitting and risk being affected by outliers and noise. In addition, they are required to tune their numerous parameters. Under this background, this study proposes the application of Random Forests(RF) to overcome the weakness of the traditional techniques. RF were designed by Leo Breiman, an American statistician and professor, and are an ensemble learning technique. This algorithm has both features originating from bagging algorithm, which is to extend a single decision tree to various decision trees, and from random input selection. The benefit of our proposed algorithm is free from an overfitting issue, and both noise and outliers in the dataset cannot have an effect on it. Thus, our model can yield high accuracy in forecasting corporate credit ratings. To validate the effectiveness of RF in predicting corporate credit ratings, we applied it to a real world dataset of corporate credit rating in Korea. The data that we used for this research consisted of various financial ratios of 1,295 corporations and their corporate credit ratings. To evaluate and compare our model with traditional methods, we used the following methods: MDA(Multiple Discriminant Analysis), ANN(Artificial Neural Network) and MSVM(Multiclass SVM). Each model’s performance was calculated by predictive accuracy based on training and validation.　Empirical results showed that RF outperforms other traditional methods from the perspective of prediction accuracy."

Variation and Uncertainty in the Predicted Flowering Dates of Cherry Blossoms Using the CMIP5 Climate Change Scenario,2016,"['Plant phenology', 'cherry blossoms', 'global climate models', 'multi-model ensemble', 'uncertainty']",,"In this study, we analyzed changes in the predicted flowering date (PFD) for cherry blossom trees under changing climate conditions by simulating the PFDs for six sites on the Korean Peninsula between 1981 and 2010. The spatial downscaled climate data from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 scenarios of 30 global climate models (GCMs) were used in the analysis. Here, we present the range of uncertainty in the PFDs, which were calculated by comparing the simulated PFDs to the observed flowering dates. We determined that the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of PFDs from individual GCMs, at 7-15 days, were greater in range than those of the mean PFDs from multiple GCMs, at 7-8 days. During three future periods of 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100, the standard deviations (SD), the interquartile ranges (IQRs), and the relative changes in the mean predicted flowering dates (MPFDs) were calculated to quantify the uncertainty levels inherent from the climate scenarios of multiple GCMs. Distinctive changes in the SDs and IQRs of MPFD were found among the analyzed sites. The SDs increased with time between each future period in Seoul, Incheon, and Jeonju, whereas those in Daegu, Busan, and Mokpo decreased with time. In addition, the IQRs increased with time at Seoul, Incheon, Jeonju, and Daegu but not at Busan and Mokpo. The relative changes in the MPFDs at all six sites became greater with time toward the year 2100. Therefore, combining multiple GCM scenarios may not contribute largely to reduce the uncertainty in the PFDs under changing climate conditions, although it may be useful in quantifying the uncertainty in order to make better decisions based on more accurate information."

Box-office forecasting based on sentiments of movie reviews and Independent subspace method,2016,"['Box-office forecasting', 'Motion pictures', 'Sentiment analysis', 'Movie reviews', 'Independent subspace model']",,"<P>Box-office forecasting is a challenging but important task for movie distributors in their decision making process. Many previous studies have tried to determine a way to accurately predict the box-office, but the results reported have not been satisfactory for two main reasons: (1) lack of variable diversity and (2) simplicity of forecasting algorithms. Although the importance of word-of-mouth (WOM) has consistently emphasized in past studies, only summarized information, such as volume or valence of user ratings is commonly used. In forecasting algorithms, multiple linear regression is the most popular algorithm because it generates not only predicted values but also variable significances. In this study, new box-office forecasting models are presented to enhance the forecasting accuracy by utilizing review sentiments and employing non-linear machine learning algorithms. Viewer sentiments from review texts are used as input variables in addition to conventional predictors, whereas three machine learning-based algorithms, i.e., classification and regression tree (CART), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR), are employed to capture non-linear relationship between the box-office and its predictors. In order to provide variable importance for machine learning-based forecasting algorithms, an independent subspace method (ISM) is applied. Forecasting results from six different forecasting periods show that the presented methods can make accurate and robust forecasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</P>"

SVM을 이용한 VKOSPI 일 중 변화 예측과 실제 옵션 매매에의 적용,2016,"['기계학습', 'SVM', '옵션 매매', 'Machine Learning', 'Support Vector Machine', 'VKOSPI', 'Option Trading']",,"Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence. It refers to an area of computer science related to providing machines the ability to perform their own data analysis, decision making and forecasting. For example, one of the representative machine learning models is artificial neural network, which is a statistical learning algorithm inspired by the neural network structure of biology. In addition, there are other machine learning models such as decision tree model, naive bayes model and SVM(support vector machine) model. Among the machine learning models, we use SVM model in this study because it is mainly used for classification and regression analysis that fits well to our study. The core principle of SVM is to find a reasonable hyperplane that distinguishes different group in the data space. Given information about the data in any two groups, the SVM model judges to which group the new data belongs based on the hyperplane obtained from the given data set. Thus, the more the amount of meaningful data, the better the machine learning ability.  In recent years, many financial experts have focused on machine learning, seeing the possibility of combining with machine learning and the financial field where vast amounts of financial data exist. Machine learning techniques have been proved to be powerful in describing the non-stationary and chaotic stock price dynamics. A lot of researches have been successfully conducted on forecasting of stock prices using machine learning algorithms. Recently, financial companies have begun to provide Robo-Advisor service, a compound word of Robot and Advisor, which can perform various financial tasks through advanced algorithms using rapidly changing huge amount of data. Robo-Advisers main task is to advise the investors about the investors personal investment propensity and to provide the service to manage the portfolio automatically.  In this study, we propose a method of forecasting the Korean volatility index, VKOSPI, using the SVM model, which is one of the machine learning methods, and applying it to real option trading to increase the trading performance. VKOSPI is a measure of the future volatility of the KOSPI 200 index based on KOSPI 200 index option prices. VKOSPI is similar to the VIX index, which is based on S&P 500 option price in the United States. The Korea Exchange(KRX) calculates and announce the real-time VKOSPI index. VKOSPI is the same as the usual volatility and affects the option prices. The direction of VKOSPI and option prices show positive relation regardless of the option type (call and put options with various striking prices). If the volatility increases, all of the call and put option premium increases because the probability of the options exercise possibility increases. The investor can know the rising value of the option price with respect to the volatility rising value in real time through Vega, a Black-Scholess measurement index of an options sensitivity to changes in the volatility. Therefore, accurate forecasting of VKOSPI movements is one of the important factors that can generate profit in option trading.  In this study, we verified through real option data that the accurate forecast of VKOSPI is able to make a big profit in real option trading. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies on the idea of predicting the direction of VKOSPI based on machine learning and introducing the idea of applying it to actual option trading.  In this study predicted daily VKOSPI changes through SVM model and then made intraday option strangle position, which gives profit as option prices reduce, only when VKOSPI is expected to decline during daytime. We analyzed the results and tested whether it is applicable to real option trading based on SVMs prediction. The results showed the prediction accuracy of VKOSPI was 57.83% on average, and the number of position entry times was 43.2 times, which is less than half of the benchma"
데이터마이닝을 이용한 박스오피스 예측,2016,"['10-', 'MLP']",,"This study deals with the prediction of the total number of movie audiences as a measure for the box office. Prediction is performed by classification techniques of data mining such as decision tree, multilayer perceptron(MLP) neural network model, multinomial logit model, and support vector machine over time such as before movie release, release day, after release one week, and after release two weeks. Predictors used are: online word-of-mouth(OWOM) variables such as the portal movie rating, the number of the portal movie rater, and blog; in addition, other variables include showing the inherent properties of the film (such as nationality, grade, release month, release season, directors, actors, distributors, the number of audiences, and screens). When using 10-fold cross validation technique, the accuracy of the neural network model showed more than 90 % higher predictability before movie release. In addition, it can be seen that the accuracy of the prediction increases by adding estimates of the final OWOM variables as predictors."

연관성 방향을 고려한 부호 헬링거 측도의 제안,2016,,,"By Wikipedia, data mining is the process of discovering patterns in a big data set involving methods at the intersection of association rule, decision tree, clustering, artificial intelligence, machine learning. and database systems. Association rule is a method for discovering interesting relations between items in large transactions by interestingness measures. Association rule interestingness measures play a major role within a knowledge discovery process in databases, and have been developed by many researchers. Among them, the Hellinger measure is a good association threshold considering the information content and the generality of a rule. But it has the drawback that it can not determine the direction of the association. In this paper we proposed a signed Hellinger measure to be able to interpret operationally, and we checked three conditions of association threshold. Furthermore, we investigated some aspects through a few examples. The results showed that the signed Hellinger measure was better than the Hellinger measure because the signed one was able to estimate the right direction of association."

It is also proposed by reliability analysis that replacement time of dropper can be reduced from 18 years to 10 years. These results show that the proposed RCM approach can optimize the maintenance procedures of catenary system."
Bankruptcy Prediction Modeling Using Qualitative Information Based on Big Data Analytics,2016,"['Bankruptcy Prediction', 'Big Data Analytics', 'Text Mining', 'Sentiment Analysis', 'Artificial Neural Networks', '부도예측', '빅데이터 분석', '텍스트 마이닝', '감성 분석', '인공신경망']",,"Many researchers have focused on developing bankruptcy prediction models using modeling techniques, such as statistical methods including multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) and logit analysis or artificial intelligence techniques containing artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM), to secure enhanced performance. Most of the bankruptcy prediction models in academic studies have used financial ratios as main input variables. The bankruptcy of firms is associated with firm’s financial states and the external economic situation. However, the inclusion of qualitative information, such as the economic atmosphere, has not been actively discussed despite the fact that exploiting only financial ratios has some drawbacks. Accounting information, such as financial ratios, is based on past data, and it is usually determined one year before bankruptcy. Thus, a time lag exists between the point of closing financial statements and the point of credit evaluation. In addition, financial ratios do not contain environmental factors, such as external economic situations. Therefore, using only financial ratios may be insufficient in constructing a bankruptcy prediction model, because they essentially reflect past corporate internal accounting information while neglecting recent information.  Thus, qualitative information must be added to the conventional bankruptcy prediction model to supplement accounting information. Due to the lack of an analytic mechanism for obtaining and processing qualitative information from various information sources, previous studies have only used qualitative information. However, recently, big data analytics, such as text mining techniques, have been drawing much attention in academia and industry, with an increasing amount of unstructured text data available on the web. A few previous studies have sought to adopt big data analytics in business prediction modeling. Nevertheless, the use of qualitative information on the web for business prediction modeling is still deemed to be in the primary stage, restricted to limited applications, such as stock prediction and movie revenue prediction applications. Thus, it is necessary to apply big data analytics techniques, such as text mining, to various business prediction problems, including credit risk evaluation. Analytic methods are required for processing qualitative information represented in unstructured text form due to the complexity of managing and processing unstructured text data.  This study proposes a bankruptcy prediction model for Korean small- and medium-sized construction firms using both quantitative information, such as financial ratios, and qualitative information acquired from economic news articles. The performance of the proposed method depends on how well information types are transformed from qualitative into quantitative information that is suitable for incorporating into the bankruptcy prediction model. We employ big data analytics techniques, especially text mining, as a mechanism for processing qualitative information. The sentiment index is provided at the industry level by extracting from a large amount of text data to quantify the external economic atmosphere represented in the media. The proposed method involves keyword-based sentiment analysis using a domain-specific sentiment lexicon to extract sentiment from economic news articles. The generated sentiment lexicon is designed to represent sentiment for the construction business by considering the relationship between the occurring term and the actual situation with respect to the economic condition of the industry rather than the inherent semantics of the term.  The experimental results proved that incorporating qualitative information based on big data analytics into the traditional bankruptcy prediction model based on accounting information is effective for enhancing the predictive performance.

In this paper, the Hogno Khaan protected area in Mongolia was selected as the study area, and a quantitative method for assessing land cover change and desertification assessment was developed using Landsat TM/ETM+ data on a local scale. In this method, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), TGSI (Topsoil Grain Size Index), and land surface albedo were selected as indicators for representing land surface conditions from vegetation biomass, landscape pattern, and micrometeorology. A Decision Tree (DT) approach was used to assess the land cover change and desertification of the Hogno Khaan protected area in 1990, 2002, and 2011. Our analysis showed no correlation between NDVI and albedo or TGSI but high correlation between TGSI and albedo. Strong correlations (0.77-0.92) between TGSI and albedo were found in the non-desertification areas. The TGSI was less strongly correlated with albedo in the low and non desertification areas, at 0.70 and 0.92; respectively. The desertification of the study area is increasing each year; in the desertification map for 1990-2002, there is a decrease in areas of zero and low desertification, and an increase in areas of high and severe desertification. From 2002 to 2011, areas of non desertification increased significantly, with areas of severe desertification also exhibiting increase, while areas of medium and high desertification demonstrated little change.

First, after close reading of the novel, I propose that the novel is structured as an allegorical parable layered with convoluting main images such as Mongolian mark and flaming tree, etc. implicating their political and aesthetical discourses—vector of devolution, critique of violences in Korean history, contradiction between natural history and human history, and political meaning of absolute refusal of eating. Then, upon this reading, I will thoroughly analyze and compare the orignal text with the translation to find various cases of unintentional mistranslation, liberal translations, or intentional mistranslation conducted through the translator’s such hidden ideologies as orientalism or mere misunderstanding of the original. This analytic comparison reveals that consumer-centered translation model might undermine aesthetic significance of the original. Walter Benjamin also in his “The Task of the Translator” warns against this kind of customer-centered translation model. Rather than presenting a solution, to propose more fundamental thoughts and discussion of translation as such for the future translation of Korean literature, I read through Benjamin’s philosophical understanding of the role of translation."
클래스 불균형 데이터를 사용한 심각도 기반 소프트웨어 품질 예측,2016,"['Data imbalance', 'Fault prediction', 'Severity', 'Sampling']",,"Most fault prediction models have class imbalance problems because training data usually contains much more non-fault class modules than fault class ones. This imbalanced distribution makes it difficult for the models to learn the minor class module data. Data imbalance is much higher when severity-based fault prediction is used. This is because high severity fault modules is a smaller subset of the fault modules. In this paper, we propose severity-based models to solve these problems using the three sampling methods, Resample, SpreadSubSample and SMOTE. Empirical results show that Resample method has typical over-fit problems, and SpreadSubSample method cannot enhance the prediction performance of the models. Unlike two methods, SMOTE method shows good performance in terms of AUC and FNR values. Especially J48 decision tree model using SMOTE outperforms other prediction models."
Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography Does Not Accurately Predict the Need of Coronary Revascularization in Patients with Stable Angina,2016,"['Multidetector computed tomography', 'coronary artery disease', 'myocardial revascularization']",,"Purpose: To evaluate the ability of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) to predict the need of coronary revascularizationin symptomatic patients with stable angina who were referred to a cardiac catheterization laboratory for coronary revascularization.Materials and Methods: Pre-angiography CCTA findings were analyzed in 1846 consecutive symptomatic patients with stable angina, who were referred to a cardiac catheterization laboratory at six hospitals and were potential candidates for coronary revascularizationbetween July 2011 and December 2013. The number of patients requiring revascularization was determined based on the severity of coronary stenosis as assessed by CCTA. This was compared to the actual number of revascularization procedures performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.Results: Based on CCTA findings, coronary revascularization was indicated in 877 (48%) and not indicated in 969 (52%) patients. Of the 877 patients indicated for revascularization by CCTA, only 600 (68%) underwent the procedure, whereas 285 (29%) of the 969 patients not indicated for revascularization, as assessed by CCTA, underwent the procedure. When the coronary arteries were divided into 15 segments using the American Heart Association coronary tree model, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CCTA for therapeutic decision making on a per-segment analysis were 42%, 96%, 40%, and 96%, respectively.Conclusion: CCTA-based assessment of coronary stenosis severity does not sufficiently differentiate between coronary segments requiring revascularization versus those not requiring revascularization. Conventional coronary angiography should be consideredto determine the need of revascularization in symptomatic patients with stable angina."

Specifically, we use the method of the PSM(Proprnsity Score Matching) and the hard maching in order to construct the control group, and utilize descriptive statistics, regression and decision tree analysis. The major results are the followings : First, start-up business founders did not actively participate in the preparation for the job search during their college or university period. This suggests that start-up business founders were not motivated to participate in the various programs for job search offered by the college or the university. Second, start-up business founders had less experience in education and training. Therefore programs for start-up business founders should be developed. Third, start-up business founders mainly engaged in ‘education service’, ‘wholesale and retail business’, and ‘lodge and restaurant.’ In particular, the shares of start-up business founders in these occupations were turned out to be higher than those of the employed. Therefore, it can be said that start-up business were biased toward means of living relative to the technology start-up."

Identifying groups of companies that particularly benefit from these functions of standards in their technological innovation and commercialization helps to customize planning and implementation of standards-related policies for demand groups. For this purpose, this study engages in profiling of SMEs whose R&D objective is to respond to standards as well as those who need to implement standards system for technological commercialization. Then it suggests a prediction model that can distinguish such companies from others.  To this end, decision tree analysis is conducted for profiling of characteristics of subject SMEs through data mining. Subject SMEs include (1) those that engage in R&D to respond to standards (Group1) or (2) those in need of product standard or technological certification policies for commercialization purposes (Group 2). Then the study proposes a prediction model that can distinguish Groups 1 and 2 from others based on several variables by adopting discriminant analysis. The practicality of discriminant formula is statistically verified.  The study suggests that Group 1 companies are distinguished in variables such as time spent on R&D planning, Korean Standard Industry Classification (KSIC) category, number of employees and novelty of technologies. Profiling result of Group 2 companies suggests that they are differentiated in variables such as KSIC category, major clients of the companies, time spent on R&D and ability to test and verify their technologies.  The prediction model proposed herein is designed based on the outcomes of profiling and discriminant analysis. Its purpose is to serve in the planning or implementation processes of standards-related policies through providing objective information on companies in need of relevant support and thereby to enhance overall success rate of standards-related projects."
Host-based intrusion detection system for secure human-centric computing,2016,,,"<P>With the advancement of information communication technology, people can access many useful services for human-centric computing. Although this advancement increases work efficiency and provides greater convenience to people, advanced security threats such as the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack have been continuously increasing. Technical measures for protecting against an APT attack are desperately needed because APT attacks, such as the 3.20 Cyber Terror and SK Communications hacking incident, have occurred repeatedly and cause considerable damage, socially and economically. Moreover, there are limitations of the existing security devices designed to cope with APT attacks that continue persistently using zero-day malware. For this reason, we propose a malware detection method based on the behavior information of a process on the host PC. Our proposal overcomes the limitations of the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems. First, we defined 39 characteristics for demarcating malware from benign programs and collected 8.7 million characteristic parameter events when malware and benign programs were executed in a virtual-machine environment. Further, when an executable program is running on a host PC, we present the behavior information as an 83-dimensional vector by reconstructing the frequency of each characteristic parameter's occurrence according to the process ID for the collected characteristic parameter data. It is possible to present more accurate behavior information by including the frequency of characteristic parameter events occurring in child processes. We use a C4.5 decision tree algorithm to detect malware in the database. The results of our proposed method show a 2.0 % false-negative detection rate and a 5.8 % false-positive detection rate.</P>"

In the last 6 years, claims of the infringement of human rights when being arrested have increased significantly, resulting in a decrease in the number of arrests made, and an increase in the search and seizure of evidence so as to ensure that any arrests made are just. With technological advances being made every day, and technology becoming an ever more prominent part of everyday life, it is natural that digital evidence and data is more important now than it has ever been in the past.On a number of occasions in recent years, during the search and seizure of digital data, prosecutors have unintentionally identified or discovered evidence of a second crime outside of that being investigated. Following the tenets of substantial truth, the evidence might be argued to be valid in a resulting investigation of the second crime. On the other hand, according to procedural truth, and as has been ruled in the Supreme Court, such evidence has been deemed to be inadmissible in court due to a lack of a warrant for the investigation of that specific crime at the time the evidence was found. In line with the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, the discovery of such evidence during an investigation has the potential to not only hinder an investigation of the second crime, but also derail the original investigation due to an, albeit unintentionally, illegal and unwarranted search.The participation of a lawyer from the company being investigated in the seizure and search procedure of electronic information or information storage devices is an issue worthy of discussion in developing fairer and more effective procedures for both those investigating and being investigated. Having an in-house lawyer present and participating in the seizure of data might ensure that correct procedures are followed, and that searches remain within the boundaries of the warrant issued for the seizure. This paper also argues that such participation is not only necessary for the original seizure of data, but also for the creation of any copies of the data being made throughout the investigation, so as to ensure the legality of any seizure and analysis of data.A previous investigation found that the majority of in-house lawyers in companies were not well-informed of the correct procedure to be followed in the case of the seizure of data from their company; thus, often leading to the absence of participation which lies at the heart of this issue. In South Korea, the issue of urgency in the seizure of data relating to a crime has also been raised as the reason for the regular omission of participation. While urgency may certainly play a factor in the effective seizure of data, a Supreme Court judge declared, last year, that any seizure of data requires a warrant specific to the crime to which the data relates. It should be noted, that the prosecution has decried this decision, arguing that the application for a second warrant would counter the effectiveness of urgent data collection and allow those subject to the seizure of the newly found evidence to cover it up or get rid of it before the new warrant is approved.This paper argues for the need for the development and creation of clear guidelines related to the procedures to be followed by in-house lawyers in the event of a seizure of data, and to expressly inform companies about said guidelines so as to ensure the timely, effective, and legal seizure of data in all cases."
