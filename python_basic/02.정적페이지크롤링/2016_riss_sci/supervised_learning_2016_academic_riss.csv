Multipath Mitigation for Pulses Using Supervised Learning: Application to Distance Measuring Equipment,2016,"['distance measuring equipment', 'APNT', 'GNSS', 'supervised learning']",,"This paper presents a method to suppress multipath induced by pulses using supervised learning. In modern electronics, pulses have been used for various purposes such as communication or distance measurements. Like other signals, pulses also suffer from multipath. When a pulse and a multipath are overlapped, the original pulse shape is distorted. The distorted pulse could result in communication failures or distance measurement errors. However, a large number of samples available from a pulse can be used to effectively reject multipath by using a supervised learning method. This paper introduces how a supervised learning method can be applied to Distance Measuring Equipment. Simulation results show that multipath induced distance measuring error can be suppressed by 10 ~ 45 percent depending on the allowed pulse shape variation allowed in a standard."

Unsupervised Learning for Crowdsourced Indoor Localization in Wireless Networks,2016,,,"<P>Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) location fingerprinting has become a prevalent approach to indoor localization. However, its widespread adoption has been hindered by the need for manual efforts to collect location-labeled fingerprints for the calibration of a localization model. Several semi-supervised learning methods have been applied to reduce such manual efforts by exploiting unlabeled fingerprints, but they still require some amount of labeled fingerprints for initializing the learning process. In this research, in order to obviate the need for location labels or references, we propose a novel unsupervised learning method that calibrates a localization model using unlabeled fingerprints based on a hybrid global-local optimization scheme. The method determines the optimal placement of fingerprint sequences on an indoor map, under the constraint imposed by the inner structure shown on the map such as walls and partitions. An efficient interaction between a global and a local optimization in the hybrid scheme drastically reduces the complexity of the learning task. Experiments carried out in a single-and a multi-story building revealed that the proposed method could successfully build a precise localization model without any location reference or explicit efforts to collect labeled samples.</P>"
Deformable MR Prostate Segmentation via Deep Feature Learning and Sparse Patch Matching,2016,,,"<P>Automatic and reliable segmentation of the prostate is an important but difficult task for various clinical applications such as prostate cancer radiotherapy. The main challenges for accurate MR prostate localization lie in two aspects: (1) inhomogeneous and inconsistent appearance around prostate boundary, and (2) the large shape variation across different patients. To tackle these two problems, we propose a new deformable MR prostate segmentation method by unifying deep feature learning with the sparse patch matching. First, instead of directly using handcrafted features, we propose to learn the latent feature representation from prostate MR images by the stacked sparse auto-encoder (SSAE). Since the deep learning algorithm learns the feature hierarchy from the data, the learned features are often more concise and effective than the handcrafted features in describing the underlying data. To improve the discriminability of learned features, we further refine the feature representation in a supervised fashion. Second, based on the learned features, a sparse patch matching method is proposed to infer a prostate likelihood map by transferring the prostate labels from multiple atlases to the new prostate MR image. Finally, a deformable segmentation is used to integrate a sparse shape model with the prostate likelihood map for achieving the final segmentation. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the dataset that contains 66 T2-wighted prostate MR images. Experimental results show that the deep-learned features are more effective than the handcrafted features in guiding MR prostate segmentation. Moreover, our method shows superior performance than other state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Index Terms-Deformable</P>"
What is the Safe Training to Educate the Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy for Surgical Residents in Early Learning Curve?,2016,"['laparoscopic cholecystectomy', 'biliary', 'training', 'surgical resident', 'complication']",,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) performed by surgical residents.Methods: We reviewed the records of patients who underwent LC for chronic cholecystitis and gallbladder polyps between February 2010 and July 2012. All diagnoses were confirmed by biopsy. All procedures performed by surgical residents were carried out under the close supervision of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. A standard four-port method was used, and we achieved the “critical view of safety” in almost all patients.Results: Of 219 LC procedures, 136 were performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon, and 83 by surgical residents. There was no significant difference in postoperative hospital stay (1.1 vs 1.2 days, p=0.337) or complication rates (3.7% vs 2.4%, p=0.712) between the two groups. However the patients operated on by surgical residents had significantly longer operation time (40.7 vs 63.7 min, p<0.05).Conclusions: LC performed by inexperienced surgical residents under the supervision of an experienced surgeon is safe and feasible for chronic cholecystitis and gallbladder polyps. Major bile duct injury is strongly correlated with having performed fewer than 20 LC procedures, so surgical residents must secure the “critical view of safety”, and the supervising surgeon must confirm it before the cystic duct and cystic artery are ligated."
Relation extraction based on two-step classification with distant supervision,2016,,,"<P>Supervised machine learning methods have been widely used in relation extraction to find the relation between two named entities in a sentence. However, the disadvantages of supervised machine learning methods are that constructing the training data set is costly and time-consuming, and the machine learning system is ultimately dependent on the specific domain of the training data. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a two-step relation extraction model with distant supervision. The two-step model consists of a one-class model and a multi-class model. The one-class model selects positive sentences from input sentences and the multi-class model classifies the positive sentences into specific classes. In the experiments, the proposed model showed good F1-measures (62.9 % in the auto-labeled test data, 63.8 % in the gold-labeled test data), although it does not use any human-labeled training data.</P>"

An automated, robust, and fast method is required to overcome such burdensome processes. These needs are, however, challenging due to various cell shapes, intensity, and incomplete boundaries. A precise cell segmentation will allow to making a pathological diagnosis of tissue samples. A vast body of literature exists on cell segmentation in microscopy images [1]. The majority of existing work is based on input images and predefined feature models only – for example, using a deformable model to extract edge boundaries in the image. Only a handful of recent methods employ data-driven approaches, such as supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven cell segmentation algorithm for bright-field microscopy images. The proposed method minimizes an energy formula defined by two dictionaries – one is for input images and the other is for their manual segmentation results – and a common sparse code, which aims to find the pixel-level classification by deploying the learned dictionaries on new images. In contrast to deformable models, we do not need to know a prior knowledge of objects. We also employed convolutional sparse coding and Alternating Direction of Multiplier Method (ADMM) for fast dictionary learning and energy minimization. Unlike an existing method [1], our method trains both dictionaries concurrently, and is implemented using the GPU device for faster performance."

To keep up with the systematic progress of the headquarters, there had been various attempts to establish the local diocese in Chung-nam. Cheondoism rapidly gained broad acceptance and expanded the congregation.  Starting with the Seosan and Hongju dioceses in 1906, a total of 25 dioceses had been established in 14 counties, organizing the archdiocese in Seosan and Dangjin respectively.  This rapid expansion was all due to diverse mission activities.  Cheondo-kyo successfully utilized the youth organizations for missionary work. They supervised bishops and local dioceses by themselves.  Consequently, the number of local dioceses in Chung-nam had reached 11, with 16,219 followers.  More dioceses were organized and more temples were built nationwide. These led to rapid growth in congregation in the area.  Cheondo-kyo, originated from Donghak(""Eastern Learning"") in 1905 had evolved and came to be widespread in the country. And its outcome was labed the Cheondoist March First Movement.  The March First Movement, which first started in Seoul, was spread by distributing the Declaration of Independence.   It was Nonsan where the Declaration of Independence was handed out in Chungnam area.  The Nonsan diocese received the Declaration of Independence through the Hamyeol diocese of Iksan, Jeonbuk which is geographically adjacent to Nonsan. Kim Taeho and Lee Baeksoon, Cheondoists in Nonsan, received and distributed the Declaration in the area of Buyeo and Nonsan. And , as a result, the March First Movement in the Chungnam area could develop.  Cheondo-kyo followers took part in the March First Movement, and often very actively. It was their way of expressing their greatest wish for the Independence.  Cheondo-kyo believers in the Gongju area were severely persecuted, implication being they actively participated in the 3.1 Movement. It is extremely significant that the Cheondo-kyo followers took the lead from the beginning to the end of the Movement.  It is also considered very meaningful that Cheondoists in Buyeo joined the 3.1 Movement inspired by the Declaration of Independence from Nonsan whereas Christians and Cheondoists joined forces in Seosan. Kweon Byung-deok led the Movement in A-san.  Cheondo-kyo was so influential in Dangjin that it could even open the archdiocese, It is noticeable that a large number of Cheondoists gathered for the March First Movement in the area. It was recorded that Cheondoists in Yesan, Hongseong, Tae-an, and many more areas volunteered to joine the Movement."

Such acts will loss the investor’s trust in the market and hindering the development of the capital market. The significance of the civil compensation system of insider trading lies in when the insiders of listed companies use the undisclosed information to buy and sell the financial investment products and caused investors to loss. It is necessary to bear the corresponding civil liability compensation for the loss of the investors and thereby inhibiting such behaviors. This article will be comparing and analyzing the insider trading differences of the legal provisions and judicial practice of the civil compensation system between China and Korea and trying to improve the views of China’s legislative work. Before describing the civil compensation system for insider trading in China and Korea, article Ⅱ will focus on introducing the insider trading evolution of United States as an example, and then discussing its concepts and related theories in order to understand the legal regulation for insider trading better. This article Ⅲ will take the case as the center to introduce insider trading legislation of China and Korea in the elements of responsibility, form and other content and focusing on analysis the “Recovery of Short Swing Profits”. Firstly, introduces the legislative evolution of insider trading in China and Korea. Then then describes the specific content of the two countries legislation. And give the cases to introduce the specific performance of the laws of the two countries. Finally, introduce the United States of the relevant legal provisions of the United States as reference. This article Ⅳ will compares the civil compensation system of insider trading between China and Korea and reference the US experience to improve the Chinese legislative system. In the legislative technology, such as the expression of the Korean Capital Market Act Article 174, paragraph 1 “the outsider exercised his power or perform their duties Know the insider information”, only one clause to cover the need to express the content that worth to learning. On the insider scope of the set how to define the “illegal access to insider information” of Chinese law and it is recognized as insider trading is questionable. On Korean law the “the people of obtain undisclosed important information” and “job-related” joint statement can fully solved how to identify the main problem. On the causal relationship, the securities law of China does not make fundamental provisions on the causal relationship. But the expression as the “other losses associated with the transaction” of Korean law gives the judge a certain discretion. And in the trail practice of Korea, Korea has accumulated a large number of cases, and it played the role of inhibition of insider trading. With regard to avoidance losses, for the “illegal income” of Chinese law should be expanded to explain and including “avoidance losses”. But considering the complexity of judicial practice of china, it seems appropriate to include “avoidance losses” in the articles. On the “Recovery of Short Swing Profits”, legislation of China on the provisions of the object has serious legislative shortcomings. While the short swing exception to consider is not enough. The above-mentioned problems it is necessary to solve. The capital market of China cannot be regarded as a sound investment market. In the regulatory authorities to strengthen supervision, at the same time the insider trading is happening more and more frequently. Although the regulatory and policy of government can influence the development of the securities market, the legislature to develop appropriate legal and regulatory policies, and regulators and the judiciary to strictly enforce the regulation of the market is to save the market."
딥러닝의 모형과 응용사례,2016,"['딥러닝', '합성곱신경망', '순환신경망', '오류역전파 알고리즘', 'Deep learning', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'Error backpropagation algorithm']",,"Deep learning model is a kind of neural networks that allows multiple hidden layers. There are various deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks. Those have been applied to fields like computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition and bioinformatics where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks. Among those architectures, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks are classified as the supervised learning model. And in recent years, those supervised learning models have gained more popularity than unsupervised learning models such as deep belief networks, because supervised learning models have shown fashionable applications in such fields mentioned above.  Deep learning models can be trained with backpropagation algorithm. Backpropagation is an abbreviation for “backward propagation of errors” and a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent. The method calculates the gradient of an error function with respect to all the weights in the network. The gradient is fed to the optimization method which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the error function.  Convolutional neural networks use a special architecture which is particularly well-adapted to classify images. Using this architecture makes convolutional networks fast to train. This, in turn, helps us train deep, muti-layer networks, which are very good at classifying images. These days, deep convolutional networks are used in most neural networks for image recognition. Convolutional neural networks use three basic ideas: local receptive fields, shared weights, and pooling. By local receptive fields, we mean that each neuron in the first(or any) hidden layer will be connected to a small region of the input(or previous layer’s) neurons. Shared weights mean that we’re going to use the same weights and bias for each of the local receptive field. This means that all the neurons in the hidden layer detect exactly the same feature, just at different locations in the input image. In addition to the convolutional layers just described, convolutional neural networks also contain pooling layers. Pooling layers are usually used immediately after convolutional layers. What the pooling layers do is to simplify the information in the output from the convolutional layer. Recent convolutional network architectures have 10 to 20 hidden layers and billions of connections between units. Training deep learning networks has taken weeks several years ago, but thanks to progress in GPU and algorithm enhancement, training time has reduced to several hours.  Neural networks with time-varying behavior are known as recurrent neural networks or RNNs. A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. Early RNN models turned out to be very difficult to train, harder even than deep feedforward networks. The reason is the unstable gradient problem such as vanishing gradient and exploding gradient. The gradient can get smaller and smaller as it is propagated back through layers. This makes learning in early layers extremely slow. The problem actually gets worse in RNNs, since gradients aren’t just propagated backward through layers, they’re propagated backward through time. If the network runs for a long time, that can make the gradient extremely unstable and hard to learn from. It has been possible to incorporate an idea known as long short-term memory units (LSTMs) into RNNs. LSTMs make it much easier to get good results when traini"
텍스트 분석을 통한 이종 매체 카테고리 다중 매핑 방법론,2016,"['Category Mapping', 'Document Classification', 'Text Mining', 'Topic Modeling']",,"In recent years, the proliferation of diverse social networking services has led users to use many mediums simultaneously depending on their individual purpose and taste. Besides, while collecting information about particular themes, they usually employ various mediums such as social networking services, Internet news, and blogs. However, in terms of management, each document circulated through diverse mediums is placed in different categories on the basis of each source’s policy and standards, hindering any attempt to conduct research on a specific category across different kinds of sources. For example, documents containing content on “Application for a foreign travel” can be classified into “Information Technology,” “Travel,” or “Life and Culture” according to the peculiar standard of each source. Likewise, with different viewpoints of definition and levels of specification for each source, similar categories can be named and structured differently in accordance with each source.  To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a plan for conducting category mapping between different sources with various mediums while maintaining the existing category system of the medium as it is. Specifically, by re-classifying individual documents from the viewpoint of diverse sources and storing the result of such a classification as extra attributes, this study proposes a logical layer by which users can search for a specific document from multiple heterogeneous sources with different category names as if they belong to the same source. Besides, by collecting 6,000 articles of news from two Internet news portals, experiments were conducted to compare accuracy among sources, supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, and homogeneous and heterogeneous learning data. It is particularly interesting that in some categories, classifying accuracy of semi-supervised learning using heterogeneous learning data proved to be higher than that of supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, which used homogeneous learning data.  This study has the following significances. First, it proposes a logical plan for establishing a system to integrate and manage all the heterogeneous mediums in different classifying systems while maintaining the existing physical classifying system as it is. This study’s results particularly exhibit very different classifying accuracies in accordance with the heterogeneity of learning data; this is expected to spur further studies for enhancing the performance of the proposed methodology through the analysis of characteristics by category. In addition, with an increasing demand for search, collection, and analysis of documents from diverse mediums, the scope of the Internet search is not restricted to one medium. However, since each medium has a different categorical structure and name, it is actually very difficult to search for a specific category insofar as encompassing heterogeneous mediums. The proposed methodology is also significant for presenting a plan that enquires into all the documents regarding the standards of the relevant sites’ categorical classification when the users select the desired site, while maintaining the existing site’s characteristics and structure as it is.  This study’s proposed methodology needs to be further complemented in the following aspects. First, though only an indirect comparison and evaluation was made on the performance of this proposed methodology, future studies would need to conduct more direct tests on its accuracy. That is, after re-classifying documents of the object source on the basis of the categorical system of the existing source, the extent to which the classification was accurate needs to be verified through evaluation by actual users. In addition, the accuracy in classification needs to be increased by making the methodology more sophisticated. Furthermore, an understanding is required that the characteristics of some categories that showed a"

Less experienced counselors, i.e., supervisees could get skilled and expertized by the supervision which more experienced supervisors offer. It can be said that supervision is the highpoint of counseling training because the supervisees who have already learned counseling theories can acquire practical and actual courses taking place in counseling setting.Supervision may consist of a variety of contents. However, it is strangely enough that their countertransference has not been seriously dealt with so far despite its importance. Countertransference is defined “re-experiencing” which supervisees recall and feel their own past experiences in relationship with their clients while counseling with them.It is true that it influences heavily their counseling itself.

For achieving these goals, this paper will analyze the gap between Toegye and Gobong about Four-Seven and will discuss Four-Seven of Toegye`s issues which could be questioned by Gobong who has the different point of view from. Toegye explains Four-Beginnings` manifestation connects with Purely-Good and Seven-Feelings` with qi. Per contra, Gobong focuses more on Feelings that Four-Beginnings and Seven-Feelings are revealed by Feelings originated from Nature. Gobong pointed out the limitation of Toegye`s opinion which deficient in explanation of qi from Four-Beginnings and li from Seven-Feelings and also lack of coherence of Not Perfectly-measured of Four-Beginnings and Perfectly-measured of Seven-Feelings. However, for Toegye, the matter of whether Perfectly-measured or Not Perfectly-measured decided not by its Origin but the Supervision of the Mind itself that consists inside mind thoroughly. Then this paper will state Toegye`s reasoning why he introduced Seven-Feelings for studying in The Chapter of Rectifying the Mind of The book Great Learning, Gobong`s contention of Not Perfectly-measured of Four-Beginnings as a refutation from Toegye`s logic, and will figure the divergence of two opinions. Toegye emphasizes only Seven-Feelings as a study subject because Purely-Good nature of Four-Beginnings cannot harm inside mind yet there is a possibility of Seven-Feelings might turn into Evil. On the other hand, Gobong focuses both Four-Beginnings and Seven-Feelings for study subjects with his view which Four-Beginnings could involve inside mind with intention and eventually can cause the result of Not Perfectly-measured of Four-Beginnings. In Toegye`s opinion, Not Perfectly-measured of Four-Beginnings is just the result of wrong manifestation interrupted by intention. Toegye insists that Four-Beginnings itself cannot be described as Perfectly-measured or Not Perfectly-measured. For him, the matter of Perfectly-measured or Not Perfectly-measured of Four-Beginnings is not defined as Origins but is on the level of the expansion of the Supervision of Mind. Throughout this paper, it will be concluded by reviewing Toegye`s Four-Seven with the Supervision of Mind. Whether Perfectly-measured of Seven-Feelings morally revealed or not depends on the Supervision of Mind, not the Origin which ``Seven-Feelings might turn into Evil``. For Toegye, Four-Beginning matter contains not its definition from the Origin but the Supervision of Mind portrayed in the perspective of the Self-Cultivation Theory. Thus, Toegye`s Four-Beginnings and Seven-Feelings could be interpreted thoroughly through the perspective of the Self-Cultivation Theory and considered as practical concept."

Both classical statistical inference and modern machine learning methods have been used in every step of data analysis that range from data calibration to inferences of physical models. We are seeing the growing popularity of using machine learning methods in classical problems of astronomical data analysis due to low-cost data acquisition using cheap large-scale detectors and fast computer networks that enable us to share large volumes of data. It is common to consider the effects of inhomogeneous spatial and temporal coverage in the analysis of big astronomical data. The growing size of the data requires us to use parallel distributed computing environments as well as machine learning algorithms. Distributed data analysis systems have not been adopted widely for the general analysis of massive astronomical data. Gathering adequate training data is expensive in observation and learning data are generally collected from multiple data sources in astronomy; therefore, semi-supervised and ensemble machine learning methods will become important for the analysis of big astronomical data."

In this paper, we propose a method which can generate named entity training corpus automatically using knowledge bases. We apply two different methods to generate corpus depending on the knowledge bases. One of the methods attaches named entity labels to text data using Wikipedia. The other method crawls data from web and labels named entities to web text data using Freebase. We conduct two experiments to evaluate corpus quality and our proposed method for generating Named entity recognition corpus automatically. We extract sentences randomly from two corpus which called Wikipedia corpus and Web corpus then label them to validate both automatic labeled corpus. We also show the performance of named entity recognizer trained by corpus generated in our proposed method. The result shows that our proposed method adapts well with new corpus which reflects diverse sentence structures and the newest entities."

Various research fields such as computer science and business management can take advantage of this feature to analyze customer-generated opinions.  In previous studies, the star rating of a review is regarded as the same as sentiment embedded in the text. However, it does not always correspond to the sentiment polarity. Due to this supposition, previous studies have some limitations in their accuracy. To solve this issue, the present study uses a supervised sentiment classification model to measure a more accurate sentiment polarity. This study aims to propose an advanced sentiment classifier and to discover the correlation between movie reviews and box-office success.  The advanced sentiment classifier is based on two supervised machine learning techniques, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Feedforward Neural Network (FNN). The sentiment scores of the movie reviews are measured by the sentiment classifier and are analyzed by statistical correlations between movie reviews and box-office success. Movie reviews are collected along with a star-rate. The dataset used in this study consists of 1,258,538 reviews from 175 films gathered from Naver Movie website (movie.naver.com).  The results show that the proposed sentiment classifier outperforms Naive Bayes (NB) classifier as its accuracy is about 6% higher than NB. Furthermore, the results indicate that there are positive correlations between the star-rate and the number of audiences, which can be regarded as the box-office success of a movie. The study also shows that there is the mild, positive correlation between the sentiment scores estimated by the classifier and the number of audiences. To verify the applicability of the sentiment scores, an independent sample t-test was conducted. For this, the movies were divided into two groups using the average of sentiment scores. The two groups are significantly different in terms of the star-rated scores."

First, the level-based classes were run by assigning appropriate number of students toeach level based on their GPA, hiring part-time teachers, and dividing the full-time teachers’burden of lesson preparation. Second, the classes were divided by, and customized to differentlevels. The differentiated curriculum and “different class material but same student evaluation”approach were applied in this process. As a result, high-level students gained advantages fromthis class while low-level students were not benefited, in fact. Third, as GPA-centered system,the level-based class caused division and exclusion among students. However, it also providedlow-level students with learning opportunities by creating a class entirely for them and theirlearning. Lastly, teachers shared their frustration with feeling disconnected from students. Theysometimes had to supervise students whom they do not teach in class; students were frequentlyreassigned to each level after midterm and final exams during semester. Thus, it was difficultfor them to organize their classes and get to know individual students. It was claimed that thelevel-based class was an effective way of teaching.

There was a serious lag between reality and the law. In order to actively promote the development of the aviation industry and overcome implementation issues of the Civil Aviation Law, Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) initiated modification procedure the law and published new draft of Civil Aviation Law in August 2016. The spirit of this modification is to learn and absorb new achievements of domestic and foreign legislation and the International Convention on civil aviation. Furthermore, the purpose of the revision is to provide favorable policy for the development of civil aviation industry and improve aviation safety and supervision, strengthen and protection of consumer rights and interests, to enhance the safety of civil aviation activities, and promote the development of general aviation. This revision concerned to the 78 articles which are revised or deleted and 24 articles added. The highlights of the draft include but not limited to the enhancement of security management, clarification of the main responsibility for production safety. And also it added the provisions related to the construction of effective tracking capability of public air transport enterprises and license system on the transport of dangerous goods. Compared with the existing civil aviation law, the draft has made a great improvements. But there are several deficiencies and limitations in the drafts. These problems need to be supplemented and perfected through further amendments in near future."
A Method of Analyzing ECG to Diagnose Heart Abnormality utilizing SVM and DWT,2016,"['ECG', 'DWT', 'SVM']",,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal gives a clear indication whether the heart is at a healthy status or not as the early notification of a cardiac problem in the heart could save the patient's life. Several methods were launched to clarify how to diagnose the abnormality over the ECG signal waves. However, some of them face the problem of lack of accuracy at diagnosis phase of their work. In this research, we present an accurate and successive method for the diagnosis of abnormality through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), QRS complex detection and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification with overall accuracy rate 95.26%. DWT Refers to sampling any kind of discrete wavelet transform, while SVM is known as a model with related learning algorithm, which is based on supervised learning that perform regression analysis and classification over the data sample. We have tested the ECG signals for 10 patients from different file formats collected from PhysioNet database to observe accuracy level for each patient who needs ECG data to be processed. The results will be presented, in terms of accuracy that ranged from 92.1% to 97.6% and diagnosis status that is classified as either normal or abnormal factors."

His activities had goals: the first was to regain the territory and the sovereignty stolen by the Japanese empire and build a autonomic independent nation, and the second was to foil the national division and found a unified nation. He also had another goal to found a civilized nation and serve for the world peace.Baikbum, developing the independent movement centering around the provisional government of Republic of Korea, tried to build an autonomic independent nation. The autonomic independent nation that he tried to build meant a nation governed by our own people without any foreign interference. When he learned that the US and the UK in 1943 agreed to resolve the matter of Korea within international joint supervision, and when he learned that the Moscow Conference of 3 Foreign Ministers in 1945 decided the trusteeship over Korea, he held opposition movement. It was because the international joint supervision and the trusteeship meant another interference of foreign powers succeeding the Japanese empire.As Baikbum experienced the territorial and national division, he tried to establish a unified nation. As the Soviet army and the US army separately occupied the Korean peninsula by the 38th parallel, and as Syngman Rhee propelled the South to establishing separate government, Korea faced the crisis of the territorial and national division. Baikbum in this situation tried to found a unified nation. He thought that if the South established a separate government, the North would do so as well; and then the nation would be divided. He believed that the result of the division would be a nationally disastrous war regardless of our nation’s own will, as the two would become the informants of the Soviet and the US.Baikbum proposed the way for founding a unified nation: the pullout of armies of the Soviet and the US → the South and North key-figure meeting → the South and North unified general election → the establishment of a unified government. Baikbum, with Kim Gyushik, propelled it, and proposed it to the UN committee. And then, he sent Kim Ilsung and Kim Dubong letters suggesting the South and North key-figure meeting to discuss the matter. April of 1948, he went to Pyeongyang, held the South-North negotiation, and achieved an agreement for the way and the steps to establish a unified democratic government: the pullout of armies of the Soviet and the US → the convocation of All-Joseon Political Meeting → building a provisional government → founding a unified legislature → founding a unified democratic government. However, as the South and the North separately established governments, it could not be realized.Baikbum had a dream for building a civilized nation and for world peace. Baikbum’s dream was “all people in the world living together without you-me discrimination”: building a country all people in the world can live peacefully. The way was to build a autonomic independent nation without any foreign interference, to build a nation confirming people’s liberty in order to create high-level culture, and for each people to build a civilized nation with its best culture. It was Baikbum’s dream that each people would build a civilized nation and help each other, and that all people on the earth could experience peace and happiness within the world peace."

부포석(傅抱石)의 근대일본 체험과 중국 전통의 재발견,2016,"['부포석', '중국 전통의 재발견', '긴바라 세이고', '고개지', '여사잠도', '선종화', '석도', '중국근대회화', 'Fu Baoshi', 'Rediscovery of Chinese Artistic Tradition', 'Kinbara Seigo', 'Gu Kaizhi', 'The Admonitions Scroll', 'Chan Painting', 'Shitao', 'Modern Chinese Painting']",,"This paper examines how the twentieth-century Chinese painter Fu Baoshi(傅抱石, 1904-1965) rediscovered Chinese artistic traditions while studying in Japan from 1932 to 1935. One of the most prominent painters who made a constant effort to defend and revitalise Chinese painting amid Western domination in the early and mid-twentieth century, he was deeply concerned with the issue of how to explore a new creative territory within the Chinese ink and brush tradition. Fu Baoshi was born in the last years of the Qing dynasty(1644-1912) when China was going through unprecedented turmoil and transformation. Despite his humble background, his diverse experiences from an early age, including his frequent visits to the mounting and seal carving shops, his education at the newly established modern school, his teaching experiences, his identity as an artist and his overseas study with the help of Xu Beihong(1895-1953), all combined to play a significant role in his individual artistic pursuit as well as his responsibility as an artist representing his country.  This paper focuses on Fu Baoshi’s studies in Japan from 1932 to 1935 and explores the role this experience played as a catalyst for him to rethink the nature of Chinese art and its tradition, providing him with an opportunity to enlarge his artistic horizons. On 5th September 1932, Fu Baoshi went to Japan under a Chinese government scholarship to carry out research into Japanese arts and crafts with the aim of helping to improve the Jingdezhen ceramic industry. During his first year in Tokyo, his observation of Japan’s promotion of arts and crafts and protection of the country’s artistic heritage motivated him to urge the Chinese government to learn from Japan. By visiting art schools, galleries and museums, Fu Baoshi learnt about the Japanese government’s systemic institutionalisation of art and its promotion of art exhibitions and art associations, in particular the significance of national treasures and the importance of preserving them, at the same time increasing his sense of national mission as an artist.  During his second year as a post-graduate student at the Imperial School of Fine Arts in Tokyo(Teikoku bijutsu gakkō, 帝国美術学校; today Musashino Art University), Fu Baoshi concentrated on training in the history of art under the supervision of his Japanese professor Kinbara Seigo(金原省吾, 1888-1958). As such, this paper also investigates how Fu Baoshi engaged with art historical research on Chinese art through the lens of Japanese scholarship and rediscovered and reinterpreted the Chinese art tradition by analysing his own writings and other related Japanese articles. He developed his knowledge on Chinese painting through the Japanese scholarship, particularly on the Eastern Jin painter Gu Kaizhi, Tang and Song painting, and the later Ming painter Shitao, thus broadening his perspective on Chinese painting traditions as well as exerting an impact on his own individual style of painting which he was able to establish in the 1940s.  First, inspired by Kinbara Seigo’s studies, Fu Baoshi started researching the history of ‘lines; in Chinese painting and developed his scholarly interest in Gu Kaizhi. Taking Gu Kaizhi’s Admonitions Scroll as a technical model, he later established his personal style of figure painting depicting female figures. Second, having studied Tang and Song painting through his Japanese professor, he tried to analyse Chinese painting history from the perspective of the painting substance such as ‘line’, ‘colour’ and ‘ink’ as well as technique, with emphasis on the use of brushwork and ink. As well as realising the importance of the works by Chan monks of the Southern Song in terms of Chinese painting history, he was attracted to the monks’ dramatic treatment of ink and their experimentation with ink tonality which became sources of inspiration for his landscape paintings after he returned from Japan. Third, inspired by the Japanese scholarship on Shitao"
정도전의 헌법 사상에 대한 고찰,2016,"['정도전', '조선경국전', '헌법사상', '민본사상', '재상정치', 'Jung Do-jeon', 'Joseon Gyeonggukjeon', 'Constitutional thought', 'Idea for people', 'Prime minister politics']",,"Sambong Jeong Do-jeon is the one who has achieved the generational change in politics by liquidating the old tradition at the end of Goryeo Dynasty and establishing the new Joseon Dynasty together with Lee Seong-gye. He advocated the democracy and reigning of virtue based on Neo-Confucianism and he also pursued the prime minister politics. And to solidify the foundation of Neo-Confucianism, he insisted the Confucius view of the world by writing the book of ‘Bulssi Japbyeon’. Jeong Do-jeon tried to realize the ideal world of Neo-Confucianism in the real world and suggested the centralism based on the Confucian scripters called ‘Jurye’ and the theory of prime minister politics. The politics and constitutional system of Joseon followed his ‘Joseon Gyeonggukjeon’ and the economic system was established on the basis of his Land distribution system called ‘Gwajeonbup’. ‘Joseon Gyeonggukjeon’ is a kind of a Constitutional draft of Joseon Dynasty. And his Constitutional theory can also be found in the fact that he enacted the Constitutional foundation of new dynasty for himself. First of all, he considered the issue of political power and revolution for the theoretical justification of the power of new dynasty and discussed the political philosophy of Confucius virtue as a new governing principle, and he largely studied on the order and occupation of social classes, the selection of government officials and the education system. Most of all, he seemed to have tried to specify the role of king and the functions of ministers and government officials by discussing about how the government system should be composed basically. Actually, Jeong Do-jeon`s Constitutional theory has an important meaning that he tried to clarify the separation of powers between king and officials under the principle of centralized bureaucratic statism. His Constitutional theory for people is represented consistently also in the reality of power structures and governing bodies. He believes that the power abuse of government officials should be prevented in order to use their power as the measure for their people, and to do that, the political power should be focused on the central government absolutely. Thus, by concentrating all the sovereign power or control over people to the central government, the personal control of aristocrats can be suppressed and the supervision and checks between the government bodies can be conducted on the other hand. In other word, the former is to control the whole country by the central government and the latter is to classify the powers that the small authorities are controlled by the large authorities and the local government is controlled by the central government. This kind of system can be called as the strengthening of centralized system in short, and this idea came from the Chinese system of course. In other words, the national system which he thought was the centralized bureaucratic system which is neither the tyrannical politics nor vassal government. Jeong Do-jeon, as a representative for the power of officials, reminds us of the conflicts between the authority of the king and the power of officials, the power of officials which he insisted, is the power of people at the end. He tried to pursue the checks for the king and the balance of powers. In the East, the expulsion of tyrant by people was called as the dynastic revolution, and though he didn`t use the word of revolution, he thought that the existence of the king`s authority depends on the voluntary agreement of people. Korean`s strong spirit of criticism that anyone can always criticize the king or president’s wrong behaviors because the king with no civil support can be eliminated at any time and people is the root of nation seems to be caused from these historical experiences. Jung Do-jeon`s Revolution theory provided the theoretical basis for Joseon Dynasty. According to his theory, Lee Seong-gye could receive the crown by accepting the recognition of people`s calling rather than occupying the authority for himself. Therefore, when comparing Jung Do-jeon`s Revolution theory with the modern right of revolution, there is a fundamental difference in face. What can we learn from his theory? And the political system centering around the Prime minister, which Jung Do-jeon has insisted, was proper for the reality of Joseon Dynasty at that time? However, what Jo-seon Dynasty needed was to organize the national power through the absolute monarchy to be the modern nation, I think. In addition to this, the high evaluation toward Jung Do-jeon, especially the comparison of his political system centering around the Prime minister to the parliamentary system, seems to be the outcome of exaggeration and ignorance. In a democracy, the civil mind is measured by voting and the one who gets the more public support operates the national politics, and the term is also limited so that the administration is changed frequently. On the contrary, in the Constitutional theory of Jung Do-jeon, there are no voting or the principle of majority rule and the tenure of political power is not recognized. The only thing that can be changed by the revolution is the king with power. So his democracy can be called as a kind of trusteeship. On the other hand, regarding the issue whether the actual revolution or behavior of people against the king who broke the trust can be the right of people or not, though it is difficult to say about this definitely because his Constitutional theory didn`t establish the abstract concept of ‘Rights’, his intention should be interpreted positively I think."
韩国资本市场法集合投资制度对中国的借鉴意义,2016,"['자본시장', '집합투자', '금융상품', '법률체제', '지배구조', 'Capital Market', 'Collective investment', 'Financial products', 'Legal system', 'Corporate governance', '资本市场', '集合投资', '金融商品', '法律体系', '治理结构']","투자자가 자본시장에서 금융상품을 투자하기 위해서는 여러 가지 정보와 기술이 필요하다. 그 중 개인투자자는 기관투자자나 금융기관에 비하면 정보, 기술장비, 전문적 지식 등 측면에서 약한 편이다. 개인투자자는 이런 불리한 점을 극복하기 위하여 투자전문가의 힘을 빌려 투자 포트폴리오를 구성할 필요가 있다. 이런 투자수요에 부응하여 집합투자와 집합투자기구가 생성되었다. 그러나 중국 자본시장의 현실은 이러한 이론적 예측과 일치하지 않다. 중국 증권시장에서의 대부분 거래는 일반투자자의 투자로 형성된 것이다. 일반 투자자의 투자는 단기적 이익을 추구하고 투자 대상회사의 잠재적인 가치를 그다지 중시하지 않는다는 특징이 있다. 일반 투자자들의 거대한 거래량을 보고 일부 기관투자자마저도 정상적인 투자가치를 포기하였다. 중국의 일반 투자자들이 정보, 기술장비, 전문적 지식 등을 갖춘 집합투자기구를 포기하고 스스로의 판단에 의하여 투자를 선택하는 것에는 그 나름대로의 일리가 있다. 다시 말하면, 집합투자기구를 신뢰하지 않는다는 것이다. 그렇다면 중국 증권시장의 이러한 현실을 어떻게 봐야 할 것인가? 우선 고려해야 할 부분은 법률제도적인 원인이다. 중국 금융당국은 이러한 현실에서 관련 입법을 개선하기 위하여 선진국의 경험을 배워야 한다. 중국 학계에서 미국, 일본 등 선진국의 경험을 연구한 성과는 상당한 편이지만, 한국에 대한 연구는 적은 편이다. 본문은 한국 “자본시장과 금융투자업에 관한 법률”의 집합투자와 관련한 내용을 연구함으로써 중국 입법기관과 학계에 유익한 자료가 될 수 있기를 바란다. 본문 제2부분은 우선 한국 자본시장법상 집합투자와 관련된 법규정을 소개하고 그 중 존재하는 문제점을 검토한다. 현행 자본시장법은 “집합투자”개념으로 구 “간접투자자산운영업법”의 “간접투자” 개념을 대체하였다. 자본시장법 제6조제5항의 “집합투자”개념은 과거의 “간접투자”개념보다 넓어졌다. 집합투자는 집합자산, 일상적인 운용지시, 자산운용방식, 자산운용결과 배분 등 네 가지 요건을 구성한다. 동시에 자본시장법 제9조제18항 내지 제23항은 집합투자기구, 사모집합투자기구, 집합투자재산, 집합투자증권, 집합투자규약, 집합투자총회 등에 대하여 개념을 내렸다. 한국 자본시장법은 매우 방대하고 이런 저런 문제도 존재하기 마련이다. 본문은 집합투자기구를 중심으로 투자기구운용, 증권발행, 지배구조 등 세 가지 측면으로 그 중 존재하는 문제점을 검토한다. 본문 제3부분은 우선 영국, 미국, 일본 등 선진국의 집합투자에 대한 일반적 규정을 소개하고 중국법상 집합투자와 관련 내용을 서술한다. 앞의 서술로부터 중국에 집합투자 관련 입법이 아직 부족함을 알 수 있다. 중국 자본시장에서 집합투자와 관련하여 존재하는 문제점은 통일적이고 명확한 입법은 없지만 각 주관 기관이 제정한 행정입법이 광범하게 존재한다는 점이다. 집합투자에 존재하는 거래 및 감독관리문제가 갈수록 심해졌다. 이런 문제점들을 정리하면 첫째, 금융법령에서 자산운용상품 등 금융상품에 대한 규정은 불분명하고 법체제가 혼란스럽다; 둘째, 각 감독관리기관이 동일 종류의 상품에 대하여 서로 다른 규칙을 제정하고 부정당경쟁을 야기하였다; 셋째, 사모 금융상품에 대한 효율적인 규제가 없다; 넷째, 금융소비자보호문제가 갈수록 심해지고 있다; 다섯째, 전체적인 경제환경이 악화되고 민간금융을 통제할 수 없다. 현재 중국의 집합투자에 대한 입법은 “증권투자기금법”으로 볼 수 있다. 집합투자에 대하여 효율적인 감시체제를 구조하기 위해서는 “증권투자기금법”을 “집합투자법”으로 개정할 필요가 있다. 동시에 선진국의 금융법 경험을 배워 금융법 통합작업을 빨리 실시해야 한다.","In the capital market, invest to the financial investment products requires a variety of information and technology. Compared with institutional investors and financial institutions, individual investors are in the weak position on information, technology equipment or professional knowledge. In order to overcome various unfavorable factors, it’s necessary to use the power of investment professionals and configure the appropriate portfolio. Thereby comes collective investment and collective investment schemes. But the reality of china’s market and the general theoretical predictions are not unanimous. China’s stock market trading volume mostly comes from retail investors. Their investment approach is generally seeking short-term interests, not valuing the potential value of the company’s growth. But due to the huge trading volume of their transactions, resulting in part of the institutional investors does not fulfill the normal value investment philosophy. Retail investors in china prefer choosing their own investment operations rather than rely on collective investment scheme that have more information, technological equipment and expertise. They must have their reasons. The collective investment scheme is the root cause of mistrust. Reflect on why this result is generated, the first consideration should be the legal institutional reasons. In order to improve the relevant legislation, it is necessary to learn from other countries. Lots of domestic legislative research on development of capital market and regulations in Europe, United States and Japan has been made, but research on Korea’s experience is so limited. This paper will focus on “Capital Market and Financial Investment Act” of Korea regarding to collective investment, try to provide useful information to china’s domestic legislatures and academics. The second part of this paper will introduce the provisions relating to collective investment on Korea’s capital market act and discuss existing problems. In force Korea’s capital market act with “collective investment” instead of the “indirect investment”, it is from the “Indirect investment asset management business act”. Compared with the past “indirect investment”, current capital market act Article 6, paragraph 5 of the collective investment made more abroad regulations. Collective investment by the collection of assets does not accept the daily use instruction, asset management approach, asset allocation using the results of four elements composing. And Korea’s capital market act Article 9, paragraph 18 to 23 set to concept of the collective investment scheme, private collective investment scheme, investment property collections, collective investment securities, collective investment contract and the investor conference. Korea’s capital market act is rich in contents, but still have many problems. This paper will focus on collective investment scheme, review the problems regarding operational structure of scheme, issuance of equity securities, corporate governance. The third part will introduce the general provisions of the UK, US and Japan on collective investment and China’s Law and regulations. We can clearly see that, China has not made unifying legislation on collective investment. Collective investment on China’s capital market presence of the problem is, although there have no unifying legislative provisions, but the competent authority of the relevant legislative acts of the executive is widespread. Trading and regulatory issues exist in collective investment have become increasingly serious. Generally there are the following points: First, provisions on financial instruments are not clear, and the legal system is disordered; Second, the various regulatory agencies operating on the same product in different settings with different rules, that resulting in unfair competition; Third, the private nature of financial products lack effective legal regulation; Fourth, the financial consumer protection problem was unfavorable and growing; Fifth, the economic environment problems resulted from the regulation of private finance. China’s current laws and regulations relating to the collection investment is the “Securities Investment Fund Act”. In order to improve the regulation of collective investment, it is necessary to adapt the method directly into a “Collective Investment Act”. While referring to the experience of other advanced countries financial legislation, it’s necessary to step up integration of financial supervision legislation."
