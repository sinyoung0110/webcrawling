Automated Scoring of L2 Spoken English with Random Forests,2016,"['automated scoring', 'L2 spoken English', 'learner corpus', 'random forests']",,"The purpose of the present study is to assess second language (L2) spoken English using automated scoring techniques. Automated scoring aims to classify a large set of learners` oral performance data into a small number of discrete oral proficiency levels. In automated scoring, objectively measurable features such as the frequencies of lexical and grammatical items are generally used as exploratory variables to predict oral proficiency levels, any of which can be used as a criterion variable in this study. We have chosen the NICT JLE Corpus, a corpus of 1,281 Japanese EFL learners` speech productions coded into nine oral proficiency levels (Izumi, Uchimoto, & Isahara, 2004). The nine oral proficiency levels were used as the criterion variables and linguistic features analyzed in Biber (1988) as explanatory variables. We employed random forests (Breiman, 2001), a powerful method for text classification and feature extraction, to predict oral proficiency. As a result of random forests with the out-of-bag error estimate, 60.11% of the productions were correctly classified. Compared to the baseline accuracy of the simplest possible algorithm of always choosing the most frequent level (37.63%), our random forests model improved prediction by 22.48 points. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient with human scoring was 0.85. Predictors that showed a clear discrimination of oral proficiency levels were tokens, types, and the frequency of nouns in the order of strength."
Object Classification Method Using Dynamic Random Forests and Genetic Optimization,2016,"['Object Classification', 'Random Forest', 'Genetic Algorithm', 'Classifier Ensemble']",,"In this paper, we proposed the object classification method using genetic and dynamic random forest consisting of optimal combination of unit tree. The random forest can ensure good generalization performance in combination of large amount of trees by assigning the randomization to the training samples and feature selection, etc. allocated to the decision tree as an ensemble classification model which combines with the unit decision tree based on the bagging. However, the random forest is composed of unit trees randomly, so it can show the excellent classification performance only when the sufficient amounts of trees are combined. There is no quantitative measurement method for the number of trees, and there is no choice but to repeat random tree structure continuously. The proposed algorithm is composed of random forest with a combination of optimal tree while maintaining the generalization performance of random forest. To achieve this, the problem of improving the classification performance was assigned to the optimization problem which found the optimal tree combination. For this end, the genetic algorithm methodology was applied. As a result of experiment, we had found out that the proposed algorithm could improve about 3~5% of classification performance in specific cases like common database and self infrared database compare with the existing random forest. In addition, we had shown that the optimal tree combination was decided at 55~60% level from the maximum trees."
Random Forest Model for Silicon-to-SPICE Gap and FinFET Design Attribute Identification,2016,"['Random forest', 'Attribute', 'Importance', 'Impact', 'SPICE', 'FinFET']",,"We propose a novel application of random forest, a machine learning–based general classification algorithm, to analyze the influence of design attributes on the silicon-to-SPICE (S2S) gap. To improve modeling accuracy, we introduce magnification of learning data as well as randomization for the counting of design attributes to be used for each tree in the forest. From the automatically generated decision trees, we can extract the so-called importance and impact indices, which identify the most significant design attributes determining the S2S gap. We apply the proposed method to actual silicon data, and observe that the identified design attributes show a clear trend in the S2S gap. We finally unveil 10nm key fin-shaped field effect transistor (FinFET) structures that result in a large S2S gap using the measurement data from 10nm test vehicles specialized for model-hardware correlation."
A Random Forest Model Based Pollution Severity Classification Scheme of High Voltage Transmission Line Insulators,2016,"['Insulator', 'Flashover', 'Pollution', 'Discrete wavelet transform', 'Random forest model']",,"Tower insulators in electric power transmission network play a crucial role in preserving the reliability of the system. Electrical utilities frequently face the problem of flashover of insulators due to pollution deposition on their surface. Several research works based on leakage current (LC) measurement has been already carried out in developing diagnostic techniques for these insulators. Since the LC signal is highly intermittent in nature, estimation of pollution severity based on LC signal measurement over a short period of time will not produce accurate results. Reports on the measurement and analysis of LC signals over a long period of time is scanty. This paper attempts to use Random Forest (RF) classifier, which produces accurate results on large data bases, to analyze the pollution severity of high voltage tower insulators. Leakage current characteristics over a long period of time were measured in the laboratory on porcelain insulator. Pollution experiments were conducted at 11 kV AC voltage. Time domain analysis and wavelet transform technique were used to extract both basic features and histogram features of the LC signal. RF model was trained and tested with a variety of LC signals measured over a lengthy period of time and it is noticed that the proposed RF model based pollution severity classifier is efficient and will be helpful to electrical utilities for real time implementation."

"Climate effect on tree-ring widths of Fagus orientalis in the Caspian forests, northern Iran",2016,"['Caspian forests', 'crossdating', 'dendrochronology', 'oriental beech', 'tree ring']",,"This study aims at understanding the impacts of climate factors on the annual growth variations of oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) at the Kheyrud Forest Research Station located in the Caspian forests of northern Iran. To this end, 18 disc samples were randomly taken from altitudes of 1038 to 1152 m above sea level. Tree rings were measured using TSAP-win software and a LINTABII machine. Since false and missing rings are typical in beech trees, skeleton plots were created to enhance crossdating accuracy. Chronologies were observed for a total of 15 samples. Meteorological data for rainfall and air temperature were recorded at the Nowshahr Meteorological Station, located near the study sites. Results showed a signiﬁcant correlation between mean annual air temperature and radial growth (R D 0.54). Within the growing season, August temperatures reveal a signiﬁcant correlation with tree ring (R D 0.41) while the highest association was observed in the previous December (R D 0.44) and the least association was found in February (R D 0.31). Excluding March (R D 0.33), there appeared to be no signiﬁcant correlation between precipitation accumulated during and prior to the growing season and tree ring. In addition to oriental beech, there are many other species important to this region that may be sensitive to increasing temperatures."
Modelling Stem Diameter Variability in Pinus caribaea (Morelet) Plantations in South West Nigeria,2016,"['Stem diameter variability', 'standard deviation of diameter', 'coefficient of variation of diameter', 'Percentiles', 'Pinus caribaea']",,"Stem diameter variability is an essential inventory result that provides useful information in forest management decisions.

Sixty temporary sample plots of size $20m{\times}20m$, ranging between 15 and 37 years were sampled, covering the entire range of pine in south west Nigeria. The dbh (cm), total and merchantable heights (m), number of stems and age of trees were measured within each plot. Basal area ($m^2$), site index (m), relative spacing and percentile positions of dbh at $24^{th}$, $63^{rd}$, $76^{th}$ and $93^{rd}$ (i.e. $P_{24}$, $P_{63}$, $P_{76}$ and $P_{93}$) were computed from measured variables for each plot.

Six candidate models (3 for SDD and 3 for CVD), using three categories of explanatory variables (i.e. (i) only stand size measures, (ii) distribution measures, and (iii) combination of i and ii). The best model was chosen based on smaller relative standard error (RSE), prediction residual sum of squares (PRESS), corrected Akaike Information Criterion ($AIC_c$) and larger coefficient of determination ($R^2$). The results of the LMM indicated that location and plot effects were not significant. The CVD and SDD models having only measures of percentiles (i.e. $P_{24}$ and $P_{93}$) as predictors produced better predictions than others. However, CVD model produced the overall best predictions, because of the lower RSE and stability in measuring variability across different stand developments. The results demonstrate the potentials of CVD in modelling stem diameter variability in relationship with percentiles variables."

This method is based on MV (margin of victory), a scaled difference in the votes at the infinite forest between the first and second most popular categories of the current random forest. We can note that if MV is negative then there is discrepancy between the current and infinite forests. More precisely, our method is based on the proportion of cases that –MV is greater than a fixed small positive number (say, 0.03).We derive an appropriate diagnostic statistic for our method and then calculate the distribution of the statistic. A simulation study is performed to compare our method with a recently proposed diagnostic statistic."

A financial returns data is the presence of volatility clustering but machine learning models assume a constant variance. We therefore extend Random Forest model with the most widely used model for volatility clustering, the GARCH process. This GARCH extended Random Forest model is applied to show whether to improve the predictability of exchange rate return or not. In addition using this model, which variables are important for volatility in exchange market.  Our results show that GARCH extended Random Forest model has a great potential for improving the predictive performance of the forecasting of exchange rate returns.

We analyzed the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database which contains half-hour ECG recorded from 48 subjects. This study included not only the linear features but also non-linear features for the improvement of classification performance. We classified abnormal ECG using mean_NN (mean of heart rate), SD1/SD2 (geometrical feature of poincare HRV plot), SE (spectral entropy), pNN100 (percentage of a heart rate longer than 100 ms) affecting accurate classification among combined of linear and nonlinear features. We compared our proposed method with Neural Networks to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm. When we used the features extracted from the HRV as an input variable for classifier, random forest used only the most contributed variable for classification unlike the neural networks. The characteristics of random forest enable the dimensionality reduction of the input variables, increase a efficiency of classifier and can be obtained faster, 11.1% higher accuracy than the neural networks."

Forest fire in South Korea is highly influenced by humidity, wind speed, temperature, and precipitation. To effectively forecast forest fire occurrence, we developed a forest fire danger rating model using weather factors associated with forest fire in 2000yrs. Forest fire occurrence patterns were investigated statistically to develop a forest fire danger rating index using times series weather data sets collected from 76 meteorological observation centers. The data sets were used for 11 years from 2000 to 2010. Development of the national forest fire occurrence probability model used a logistic regression analysis with forest fire occurrence data and meteorological variables. Nine probability models for individual nine provinces including Jeju Island have been developed. The results of the statistical analysis show that the logistic models (p<0.05) strongly depends on the effective and relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall. The results of verification showed that the probability of randomly selected fires ranges from 0.687 to 0.981, which represent a relatively high accuracy of the developed model. These findings may be beneficial to the policy makers in South Korea for the prevention of forest fires."

The subjects were 40 young children from a child-care center in K city. 20 children were randomly assigned to the experimental group, and the other were assigned to the control group. The forest experience activity consisted of forest experience, forest play, nature inquiring activity, and ecosystem understanding. The activities in forest are inseparable from playing, and playing is life itself for young children. Forest experience in this activity consists of 4 steps which are first step for awaken enthusiasm: zeal in the presence of peace and tension of mind, second for concentration: can achieve dramatic enlightenment, third for direct experience: the process of deeply knowing nature and fourth for share emotion: existence of nature give impression. In results, the activity had effects on the children's playfulness and leadership.

To predict corporate credit ratings better, various algorithms of machine learning have been proposed and applied. However, the algorithms have some limitations. First of all, they are unable to give a solution for which variables in the dataset should be considered as input variables to effectively predict a dependent variable. Also, they are easily exposed to overfitting and risk being affected by outliers and noise. In addition, they are required to tune their numerous parameters. Under this background, this study proposes the application of Random Forests(RF) to overcome the weakness of the traditional techniques. RF were designed by Leo Breiman, an American statistician and professor, and are an ensemble learning technique. This algorithm has both features originating from bagging algorithm, which is to extend a single decision tree to various decision trees, and from random input selection. The benefit of our proposed algorithm is free from an overfitting issue, and both noise and outliers in the dataset cannot have an effect on it. Thus, our model can yield high accuracy in forecasting corporate credit ratings. To validate the effectiveness of RF in predicting corporate credit ratings, we applied it to a real world dataset of corporate credit rating in Korea. The data that we used for this research consisted of various financial ratios of 1,295 corporations and their corporate credit ratings. To evaluate and compare our model with traditional methods, we used the following methods: MDA(Multiple Discriminant Analysis), ANN(Artificial Neural Network) and MSVM(Multiclass SVM). Each model’s performance was calculated by predictive accuracy based on training and validation.　Empirical results showed that RF outperforms other traditional methods from the perspective of prediction accuracy."

For accurate and prompt crime prediction and prevention, both a classification model of crime with high accuracy based on past criminal records and well-designed system interface are required. However previous studies on the analysis of crime factors have limitations in terms of accuracy due to the difficulty of data preprocessing. In addition, existing crime monitoring systems merely offer a vast amount of crime analysis results, thereby they fail to provide users with functions for more effective monitoring. In this paper, we propose a classification model for types of crime based on random-forest algorithms and system design factors for real-time crime prediction. From our experiments, we proved that our proposed classification model is superior to others that only use criminal records in terms of accuracy. Through the analysis of existing crime monitoring systems, we also designed and developed a system for real-time crime monitoring."

Downscaling of AMSR-E soil moisture with MODIS products using machine learning approaches,2016,,,"<P>Passive microwave remotely sensed soil moisture products, such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) data, have been routinely used to monitor global soil moisture patterns. However, they are often limited in their ability to provide reliable spatial distribution data for soil moisture due to their coarse spatial resolutions. In this study, three machine learning approaches-random forest, boosted regression trees, and Cubist-were examined for the downscaling of AMSR-E soil moisture (25 9 25 km) data over two regions (South Korea and Australia) with different climatic characteristics using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products (1 km), including surface albedo, land surface temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, Leaf Area Index, and evapotranspiration (ET). Results showed that the random forest approach was superior to the other machine learning models for downscaling AMSR-E soil moisture data in terms of the correlation coefficient [r = 0.71/0.84 (South Korea/Australia) for random forest, 0.75/0.77 for boosted regression trees, and 0.70/0.61 for Cubist] and root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.049/0.057, 0.052/0.078, and 0.051/0.063, respectively) through cross-validation. The ET and LST were identified as the most influential among the six input parameters when estimating AMSR-E soil moisture for South Korea, while ET, albedo, and LST were very useful for Australia. In overall, the downscaled soil moisture with 1 km resolution yielded a higher correlation with in situ observations than the original AMSR-E soil moisture data. The latter appeared higher than the downscaled data in forested areas, possibly due to the overestimation of soil moisture by passive microwave sensors over forests, which implies that downscaling can mitigate such overestimation of soil moisture.</P>"

Our proposals are tested under numerous synthetic and real datasets; subsequently, they are compared with plain kernel-based predictive models and their subsampling approach. Numerical studies demonstrate that ensemble approach outperforms plain kernel-based predictive models."

DROWSY BEHAVIOR DETECTION BASED ON DRIVING INFORMATION,2016,"['Drowsy behavior', 'Acceleration', 'Steering angle', 'Random forest', 'Ensemble machine learning method', 'Vehicle safety']",,"Drowsy behavior is more likely to occur in sleep-deprived drivers. Individuals’ drowsy behavior detection technology should be developed to prevent drowsiness related crashes. Driving information such as acceleration, steering angle and velocity, and physiological signals of drivers such as electroencephalogram (EEG), and eye tracking are adopted in present drowsy behavior detection technologies. However, it is difficult to measure physiological signal, and eye tracking requires complex experiment equipment. As a result, driving information is adopted for drowsy driving detection. In order to achieve this purpose, driving experiment is performed for obtaining driving information through driving simulator. Moreover, this paper investigates effects of using different input parameter combinations, which is consisted of lateral acceleration, longitudinal acceleration, and steering angles with different time window sizes (i.e. 4 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 60 s), on drowsy driving detection using random forest algorithm. 20 s-size datasets using parameter combination of accelerations in lateral and longitudinal directions, compared to the other combination cases of driving information such as steering angles combined with lateral and longitudinal acceleration, steering angles only, longitudinal acceleration only, and lateral acceleration only, is considered the most effective information for drivers’ drowsy behavior detection. Moreover, comparing to ANN algorithm, RF algorithm performs better on processing complex input data for drowsy behavior detection. The results, which reveal high accuracy 84.8 % on drowsy driving behavior detection, can be applied on condition of operating real vehicles."

A random sampling approach was adopted. Altogether, 63 species were recorded from the sampled area (0.2 ha). Family dominance results showed that Lauraceae was the most dominant followed by Fagaceae. Seventy percent of species showed low frequency distribution and species having higher frequency classes were almost absent or represented by only a few species. Dominance distribution of species resulted in a log normal distribution pattern which further signifies that the forest community was heterogeneous in nature. Species Prediction and Diversity Estimation analysis categorized 80% of the species as a rare species group and 20% as abundant species group. Estimation of coefficient of variation showed that rare species have equal detection possibilities in the sampled area. Distribution of basal cover in different girth classes indicates a reverse trend to that of stand density. The results of this study show that the forest community composition is highly clustered and loosely colonized in nature."

Hence, this study proposes a way to deduce the propensity to invest in unstructured data that customers voluntarily exposed during consultation or online. Since prediction performance based on unstructured document differs according to the characteristics of text, in this study, classification algorithm optimized for the characteristic of text left by financial consumers is selected by performing prediction performance evaluation of various learning discrimination algorithms and proposed an intelligent method that automatically recommends investment products. User tests were given to MBA students. After showing the recommended investment and list of investment products, satisfaction was asked.

Real-time Traffic Sign Recognition using Rotation-invariant Fast Binary Patterns,2016,"['Traffic sign recognition', 'rotation-invariant binary patterns', 'random forest', 'convolutional neural networks']",,"In this paper, we focus on recognition of speed-limit signs among a few types of traffic signs because speed-limit sign is closely related to safe driving of drivers. Although histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and local binary patterns (LBP) are representative features for object recognition, these features have a weakness with respect to rotation, in that it does not consider the rotation of the target object when generating patterns. Therefore, this paper propose the fast rotation-invariant binary patterns (FRIBP) algorithm to generate a binary pattern that is robust against rotation. The proposed FRIBP algorithm deletes an unused layer of the histogram, and eliminates the shift and comparison operations in order to quickly extract the desired feature. The proposed FRIBP algorithm is successfully applied to German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) datasets, and the results show that the recognition capabilities of the proposed method are similar to those of other methods. Moreover, its recognition speed is considerably enhanced than related works as approximately 0.47second for 12,630 test data."

Lien has the right to procure the goods securities or to receive reimbursement until it has occurred in this case byeonjegi bonds or securities that stuff about the person who occupies another's goods or securities.The lien is recognized as a receivable from watering right to principles of equility. But legislation is done in good spirit and sometimes causing conflict. There are also rights abuses and distorted the thinking of experts and real estate professionals who are familiar with the provisions of the law.Some auction brokers are not a few people who want to pack a gain fueling the dispute to the contractor resulting litigation.Way there are several. we obtain the real estate, There are donation, inheritance, exchange, and common marketing and auction. Among them auction has a system of compulsory auctions and random auctions. This auction includes an 2015 analysis based on 150,000 cases over the year were visited new property owners through the inlet and sold at auction. The advantage of an auction is that you can buy real estate in extremely affordable price than buying the real estate market in general. However, the auction there are many risks This is because person having a right of retention with many privileges The lien is the buyer who bid the property should be acquired.However, the lien is not disclosed. And liens party can claim rights to the buyer. Right it will have problems in this regard.Auction Bidders On various liens are not registered and studying the winner is unpredictable whether the lien exists. This study reveals the problems of the lien system to find improvements.And we propose a way to minimize the creditors, tenants, the buyer of the damage. This case and the case law of the Court of liens were intensively studied in real estate auctions in order. Through this study, false, exaggerated characters lien hope that this auction is a healthy real estate market."

The total number of species captured from the entire survey area was 13 species with 8 families of fish and 5 species of amphibians. The number of species of Cyprinidae fish captured in FUR was higher than that in UMR. Upon the comparative analysis on the distribution of fish and amphibians in FUR and UMR, it was found that the number of Cyprinidae fish captured in FUR was significantly higher than that in UMR while the number of Cobitidae fish captured in UMR was higher than that in FUR. According to the analysis on the environmental factors that affect the distribution of fish, Cyprinidae fish tend to appear in rice-fields, that were flooded in winter, near the Yedang reservoir while Cobitidae fish tend to appear in rice fields that draws its water supply from forest reservoir and have a good water drainage system. In case of amphibians, the number of tadpoles captured in UMR was higher than that in FUR. Rana catesbeiana was dominant in FUR and Rana nigromaculata was dominant in UMR. Upon the analysis on the environmental factors that affect the distribution of tadpoles, it was found that Rana catesbeiana tadpoles tend to appear in rice fields, that were flooded in winter, near Yedang reservoir while Rana nigromaculata tadpoles tend to appear near mountains and far from the Yedang reservoir."
Practice of causal inference with the propensity of being zero or one: assessing the effect of arbitrary cutoffs of propensity scores,2016,"['causal inference', 'propensity score', 'positivity assumption', 'classification and regression tree', 'jackknife resampling', 'inverse propensity weighting', 'random forest']",,"Causal inference methodologies have been developed for the past decade to estimate the unconfounded effect of an exposure under several key assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the stable unit treatment value assumption, the strong ignorability of treatment assignment assumption, and the assumption that propensity scores be bounded away from zero and one (the positivity assumption). Of these assumptions, the first two have received much attention in the literature. Yet the positivity assumption has been recently discussed in only a few papers. Propensity scores of zero or one are indicative of deterministic exposure so that causal effects cannot be defined for these subjects. Therefore, these subjects need to be removed because no comparable comparison groups can be found for such subjects. In this paper, using currently available causal inference methods, we evaluate the effect of arbitrary cutoffs in the distribution of propensity scores and the impact of those decisions on bias and efficiency. We propose a tree-based method that performs well in terms of bias reduction when the definition of positivity is based on a single confounder. This tree-based method can be easily implemented using the statistical software program, R. R code for the studies is available online."

Random forest (RF) and fine scale auxiliary variables are used to estimate trend components at a fine scale. Residual components are then estimated by area-to-point residual kriging. A case study of spatial disaggregation of TRMM monthly precipitation data acquired over the Korean peninsula is carried out to illustrate the potential of the presented disaggregation method. From the evaluation results, the presented method outperformed the RF-based disaggregation method that only considers trend components and ignores residual components, in terms of accuracy statistics and the ability of coherent predictions. This case study indicates that accounting for residual components by applying a proper spatial prediction method such as area-to-point kriging is very important in spatial disaggregation of coarse scale spatial data, even though advanced regression models such as RF could have high goodness of fit for the quantification of relationships between a target attribute and auxiliary variables."
Estimation of Fractional Vegetation Cover in Sand Dunes Using Multi-spectral Images from Fixed-wing UAV,2016,"['FVC', 'Fixed-wing UAV', 'Multi-spectral Image', 'Sand Dune']",,"Since the use of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) is convenient for the acquisition of data on broad or inaccessible regions, it is nowadays used to establish spatial information for various fields, such as the environment, ecosystem, forest, or for military purposes. In this study, the process of estimating FVC (Fractional Vegetation Cover), based on multi-spectral UAV, to overcome the limitations of conventional methods is suggested. Hence, we propose that the FVC map is generated by using multi-spectral imaging. First, two types of result classifications were obtained based on RF (Random Forest) using RGB images and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) with RGB images. Then, the result map was reclassified into vegetation and nonvegetation.Finally, an FVC map-based RF were generated by using pixel calculation and FVC map-based GI (Gutman and Ignatov) model were indirectly made by fixed parameters. The method of adding NDVI shows a relatively h igher a ccuracy compared t o t hat of a dding only RGB, a nd i n particular, t he GI model shows a lower RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) with 0.182 than RF. In this regard, the availability of the GI model which uses only the values of NDVI is higher than that of RF whose accuracy varies according to the results of classification. Our results showed that the GI mode ensures the quality of the FVC if the NDVI maintained at a uniform level. This can be easily achieved by using a UAV, which can provide vegetation data to improve the estimation of FVC."

However, the long term use of these agents may be very expensive, placing a significant burden on National Healthcare Systems. The development of first biosimilar to infliximab, CT-P13 (Remsima; Celltrion Inc., Incheon, Korea and Inflextra; Hospiral, Lake Forest, Illinois, USA) has become another way to decrease the medical care cost and increase patient treatment option, but, actual equivalence of efficacy and safety of CT-P13 was investigated in rheumatic diseases only. The extrapolation of outcome from rheumatic trials to IBD and the interchangeability of CT-P13 with infliximab have come to be a matter of concern. Two recent retrospective studies reported the similarity of CT-P13 in terms of efficacy and safety. Infliximab biosimilars may be promising new treatment options for IBD patients, however, well-designed, prospective randomized non-inferiority trials should be needed to confidently integrate infliximab biosimilars into IBD treatment.

Machine Learning Approaches to Corn Yield Estimation Using Satellite Images and Climate Data: A Case of Iowa State,2016,"['Crop Yield', 'Machine Learning', 'Remote Sensing', 'Climate Data']",,"Remote sensing data has been widely used in the estimation of crop yields by employing statistical methods such as regression model. Machine learning, which is an efficient empirical method for classification and prediction, is another approach to crop yield estimation. This paper described the corn yield estimation in Iowa State using four machine learning approaches such as SVM (Support Vector Machine), RF (Random Forest), ERT (Extremely Randomized Trees) and DL (Deep Learning). Also, comparisons of the validation statistics among them were presented. To examine the seasonal sensitivities of the corn yields, three period groups were set up: (1) MJJAS (May to September), (2) JA (July and August) and (3) OC (optimal combination of month). In overall, the DL method showed the highest accuracies in terms of the correlation coefficient for the three period groups. The accuracies were relatively favorable in the OC group, which indicates the optimal combination of month can be significant in statistical modeling of crop yields. The differences between our predictions and USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) statistics were about 6-8 %, which shows the machine learning approaches can be a viable option for crop yield modeling. In particular, the DL showed more stable results by overcoming the overfitting problem of generic machine learning methods."

A total of seven landslide causative factors (elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, geology, soil, forest and land-use) were extracted from the database and then converted into raster. Landslide causative factors were provided to investigate about the spatial relationship between each factor and landslide occurrence by using fuzzy set and logistic regression model. Fuzzy membership value and logistic regression coefficient were employed to determine each factor’s rating for landslide susceptibility mapping. Then, the landslide susceptibility maps were compared and validated by cross validation technique. In the cross validation process, 50% of observed landslides were selected randomly by Excel and two success rate curves (SRC) were generated for each landslide susceptibility map. The result demonstrates the 84.34% and 83.29% accuracy ratio for logistic regression model and fuzzy set model respectively. It means that both models were very reliable and reasonable methods for landslide susceptibility analysis."

소셜 빅데이터 기반 보건복지 정책 미래신호 예측,2016,"['Social big data', 'Machine learning', 'Future signals', 'Health & welfare']",,"Objectives: The purpose of this study is to collect health and welfare-related documents mentioned in and collectable from online channels, analyze important health and welfare keywords through topic and sentimental analyses, detect future signals concerning major policies and issues related to health and welfare services, and propose a prediction model. Methods: 201,849 Health & Welfare related online documents from January 1 to March 31, 2016 from 171 Korean online channels and analyzed such documents using machine learning with random forest and Apriori algorithm association analysis. We used R software (version 3.2.1) for the association analysis data mining and visualization. Results: As for the prediction of future signals of health and welfare policies, policies that were important and supported by the people were welfare payment, health promotion, job, marriage/childbirth, health insurance, and healthcare industry (in this order). Specifically, as support for documents mentioning welfare payment and jobs was high, job creation through building a spontaneous welfare system is thought to be needed. Additionally, similar to the linkage analysis result of policies, as people were against documents that mentioned only {basic pension} policies, but supported documents that included {basic pension, welfare payment, job}, there is a strong demand for the establishment of a welfare system through active self-support and labor of the elderly. Conclusions: Social big data can be utilized in various areas. First, similar to the application in this study, future signals concerning government`s policies and new technologies can be predicted in advance and prepared for. Second, they can be used as a new data collection methods that supplement limitations in survey data collection systems. Finally, a preemptive response system against risk can be established through monitoring and predicting social crisis."
Object Classification based on Weakly Supervised E2LSH and Saliency map Weighting,2016,"['Object Classification', 'Bag of Visual Words', 'E2LSH', 'Graph-based Visual Saliency', 'Visual Language Model Method']",,"The most popular approach in object classification is based on the bag of visual-words model, which has several fundamental problems that restricting the performance of this method, such as low time efficiency, the synonym and polysemy of visual words, and the lack of spatial information between visual words. In view of this, an object classification based on weakly supervised E2LSH and saliency map weighting is proposed. Firstly, E2LSH (Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing) is employed to generate a group of weakly randomized visual dictionary by clustering SIFT features of the training dataset, and the selecting process of hash functions is effectively supervised inspired by the random forest ideas to reduce the randomcity of E2LSH. Secondly, graph-based visual saliency (GBVS) algorithm is applied to detect the saliency map of different images and weight the visual words according to the saliency prior. Finally, saliency map weighted visual language model is carried out to accomplish object classification. Experimental results datasets of Pascal 2007 and Caltech-256 indicate that the distinguishability of objects is effectively improved and our method is superior to the state-of-the-art object classification methods."

H. Wilson). We first modeled the distribution of Korean fir under current climate condition using five single-model species distribution models (SDMs) and the pre-evaluation weighted ensemble method and then predicted the distributions under future climate conditions projected with HadGEM2-AO under four CO2 emission scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5. We also investigated the predictive uncertainty stemming from five individual algorithms and four CO2 emission scenarios for better interpretation of SDM projections. Five individual algorithms were Generalized linear model (GLM), Generalized additive model (GAM), Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Generalized boosted model (GBM) and Random forest (RF). The results showed high variations of model performances among individual SDMs and the wide range of diverging predictions of future distributions of Korean fir in response to RCPs. The ensemble model presented the highest predictive accuracy (TSS = 0.97, AUC = 0.99) and predicted that the climate habitat suitability of Korean fir would increase under climate changes. Accordingly, the fir distribution could expand under future climate conditions. Increasing precipitation may account for increases in the distribution of Korean fir. Increasing precipitation compensates the negative effects of increasing temperature. However, the future distribution of Korean fir is also affected by other ecological processes, such as interactions with co-existing species, adaptation and dispersal limitation, and other environmental factors, such as extreme weather events and land-use changes. Therefore, we need further ecological research and to develop mechanistic and process-based distribution models for improving the predictive accuracy."

In contrast, predictive modeling has been rare in the fields. Hence, we focus on constructing the predictive non-parametric model, instead of the explanatory model. Gangnam-gu, Seoul was chosen as a study area and we collected single-family house sales data sold between 2011 and 2014. We applied non-parametric models proposed in machine learning area including generalized additive model(GAM), random forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines(MARS) and support vector machines(SVM). Models developed recently such as MARS and SVM were found to be superior in predictive power for house price estimation. Finally, spatial autocorrelation was accounted for in the non-parametric models additionally, and the result showed that their predictive power was enhanced further. We hope that this study will prompt methodology for property price estimation to be extended from traditional parametric models into non-parametric ones."
GOCI 위성영상과 기계학습을 이용한 한반도 연안 수질평가지수 추정,2016,"['Water Quality Index', 'GOCI', 'machine learning']",,"In Korea, most industrial parks and major cities are located in coastal areas, which results in serious environmental problems in both coastal land and ocean. In order to effectively manage such problems especially in coastal ocean, water quality should be monitored. As there are many factors that influence water quality, the Korean Government proposed an integrated Water Quality Index (WQI) based on in situmeasurements of ocean parameters(bottom dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a concentration, secchi disk depth, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus) by ocean division identified based on their ecological characteristics. Field-measured WQI, however, does not provide spatial continuity over vast areas. Satellite remote sensing can be an alternative for identifying WQI for surface water. In this study, two schemes were examined to estimate coastal WQI around Korea peninsula using in situ measurements data and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite imagery from 2011 to 2013 based on machine learning approaches. Scheme 1 calculates WQI using estimated water quality-related factors using GOCI reflectance data, and scheme 2 estimates WQI using GOCI band reflectance data and basic products(chlorophyll-a, suspended sediment, colored dissolved organic matter). Three machine learning approaches including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and a modified regression tree(Cubist) were used. Results show that estimation of secchi disk depth produced the highest accuracy among the ocean parameters, and RF performed best regardless of water quality-related factors. However, the accuracy of WQI from scheme 1 was lower than that from scheme 2 due to the estimation errors inherent from water quality-related factors and the uncertainty of bottom dissolved oxygen. In overall, scheme 2 appears more appropriate for estimating WQI for surface water in coastal areas and chlorophyll-a concentration was identified the most contributing factor to the estimation of WQI."

The total number of species captured from the entire survey area was 13 species with 8 families of fish and 5 species of amphibians. The number of species of Cyprinidae fish captured in FUR was higher than that in UMR. Upon the comparative analysis on the distribution of fish and amphibians in FUR and UMR, it was found that the number of Cyprinidae fish captured in FUR was significantly higher than that in UMR while the number of Cobitidae fish captured in UMR was higher than that in FUR. According to the analysis on the environmental factors that affect the distribution of fish, Cyprinidae fish tend to appear in rice-fields, that were flooded in winter, near the Yedang reservoir while Cobitidae fish tend to appear in rice fields that draws its water supply from forest reservoir and have a good water drainage system. In case of amphibians, the number of tadpoles captured in UMR was higher than that in FUR. Rana catesbeiana was dominant in FUR and Rana nigromaculata was dominant in UMR. Upon the analysis on the environmental factors that affect the distribution of tadpoles, it was found that Rana catesbeiana tadpoles tend to appear in rice fields, that were flooded in winter, near Yedang reservoir while Rana nigromaculata tadpoles tend to appear near mountains and far from the Yedang reservoir."
Real time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environments,2016,,,"<P>In recent years, the number of people using the Internet and network services is increasing day by day. On a daily basis, a large amount of data is generated over the Internet from zeta byte to petabytes with a very high speed. On the other hand, we see more security threats on the network, the Internet, websites, and the enterprise network. Therefore, detecting intrusion in such ultra-high-speed environment in real time is a challenging task. Many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are proposed for various types of network attacks using machine learning approaches. Most of them are unable to detect recent unknown attacks, whereas the others do not provide a real-time solution to overcome the above-mentioned challenges. Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system for ultra-high-speed big data environment using Hadoop implementation. The proposed system includes four-layered IDS architecture, which consists of the capturing layer, filtration and load balancing layer, processing or Hadoop layer, and the decision-making layer. Furthermore, feature selection scheme is proposed that selects nine parameters for classification using (FSR) and (BER), as well as from the analysis of DARPA datasets. In addition, five major machine learning approaches are used to evaluate the proposed system including J48, REPTree, random forest tree, conjunctive rule, support vector machine, and Na < ve Bayes classifiers. Results show that among all these classifiers, REPTree and J48 are the best classifiers in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency. The proposed system architecture is evaluated with respect to accuracy in terms of true positive (TP) and false positive (FP), with respect to efficiency in terms of processing time and by comparing results with traditional techniques. It has more than 99 % TP and less than 0.001 % FP on REPTree and J48. The system has overall higher accuracy than existing IDSs with the capability to work in real time in ultra-high-speed big data environment.</P>"
