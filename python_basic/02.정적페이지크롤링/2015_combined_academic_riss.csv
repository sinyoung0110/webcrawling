wide-air-gap transformer model for the design-oriented analysis of contactless power converters,2015,"['wireless', 'Commercialized core', 'contactless power transfer', 'high efficiency', 'ladder model', 'wide air gap']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>A wireless power converter topology with a small size and a high conversion efficiency has an increasing demand on small-power applications. Some design techniques to transmit power by customized cores have been already developed. However, when transferring energy by wide-gap transformers employing small-sized commercialized cores, the power losses on the winding greatly increase as the frequency increases. Then, the efficiency of the contactless power system decreases significantly due to the conduction loss and reactive components in the resonant circuit. Even though series-parallel resonant converters are largely employed, which can provide an infinite shunt impedance regardless of the coupling coefficient, when a commercialized core is employed for loosely coupled contactless power transfer applications, the large leakage inductance of the transformer significantly influences the additional power dissipation on the transformer windings. In this paper, an operating principle on how the contactless transformer with commercialized core contributes to the low efficiency is discussed. Also, a new frequency-dependent R- L ladder circuit model is introduced for the design-oriented analysis of wide-air-gap contactless power converters including the frequency-dependent losses of the transformer. A new design procedure with the proposed model is suitable for the contactless transformers employing commercialized cores. The proposed design approach is validated by 98.8-W hardware experiments. Finally, the simulation waveforms and the hardware results are compared to verify the accuracy of the frequency-dependent transformer model.</P>"

partial discharge localization based on detailed models of transformer and wavelet transform techniques,2015,"['Wavelet transform', 'Power transformer', 'RLC model', 'Multi-conductor transmission line(MTL)', 'Partial discharge', 'PD localization']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Partial Discharge (PD) is a physical phenomenon, which causes defects and damages to the insulation. This phenomenon is regarded as the most important source of fault and defect in power transformers. Therefore, methods of high speed and precision are considered of special importance for the maintenance of transformers in localization of the origin of partial discharge. In this paper, the transformer winding is first modeled in a transient state by using RLC ladder network and multiconductor transmission line (MTL) models. The parameters of the two models were calculated by Ansoft Maxwell software, and the simulations were performed by Matlab software. Then, the PD pulses were applied to the models with different widths of pulses. With regard to the fact that the signals received after the application of PD had a variable frequency nature over time, and based on the wavelet transform and signal energy, a new method was presented for the localization of PD. Ultimately; the mentioned method was implemented on a 20 kV winding distribution transformer. Then, the performances of the models used in this paper, including RLC and MTL models, were compared in different frequency bands for the correct distinction of partial discharge location."

In this study we investigated the dose-exposureresponse relationship of a triflusal formulation by population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling of its main active metabolite, hydroxy-4-(trifluoromethyl) benzoic acid (HTB). Methods: This study was a randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, two-period, two-treatment, comparative crossover design. All volunteers received a single oral loading dose of 900 mg of triflusal on Day 1, followed by a dose of 600 mg/day from Day 2 to 9. Using data from 34 healthy volunteers, 476 HTB plasma concentration data points and 340 platelet aggregation data points were used to construct PK and PD models respectively using NONMEM (version 6.2). As the PD endpoint was qualitative, we implemented binary analysis of ‘inhibition’ and ‘non-inhibition’ rather than using the actual value of the test. The final PK-PD model was evaluated using a visual predictive check (VPC) and bootstrap. Results: The time-concentration profile of HTB over the entire dosing period was described by a one-compartment model with a first-order formation rate constant for HTB. Weight was selected as a covariate for clearance and volume of triflusal, respectively. The structure and the population estimates for triflusal PK were as follows: oral clearance (CL/F) = 0.2 · (weight/71.65)0.845 L/h, oral volume of distribution (V/F) = 8.3 · (weight/71.65) L, and kf = 0.341 h.1. A sigmoid relationship between triflusal concentration and the probability of significant inhibition with shape factor was chosen as the final PD model. No time delay between concentration and response was identified. The final structure between predicted concentration ðCy pred;ijÞ and the probability of inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) relationship was as follows: Probability of IPA ¼ C19 pred;ij=ð84:919μg=mL þ C19 pred;ijÞ. Thus, we concluded this relationship is more like quantal concentration-response relationship. The current dosing regimen was considered to be efficacious based on the EC50 estimate of 84.9 μg/mL obtained in this study. Conclusions: A PK and binary probability PD model of triflusal was successfully developed for Korean healthy volunteers. The model may be used to further prediction inhibition of platelet aggregation by triflusal.

lumped impedance transformers for compact and robust coupled magnetic resonance systems,2015,"['wireless power transfer', 'Class-E inverter', 'coupled magnetic resonance system (CMRS)', 'impedance transformer', 'inductive power transfer system (IPTS)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>An innovative coupled magnetic resonance system (CMRS), introducing two lumped impedance transformers, is proposed. There are three major magnetic couplings between coils in CMRS: source-transmitter (Tx), Tx-receiver (Rx), and Rx-load couplings. Except for Tx-Rx coupling, other couplings do not directly contribute to wireless power transfer. Hence, in this paper, this miscellaneous coupling is replaced with a lumped transformer with ferrite core. Because there is only a Tx-Rx coupling, the CMRS becomes compact in size and robust to ambient changes. Moreover, the design of CMRS is drastically simplified without complicated multiresonance tunings due to little magnetic flux linkage from the source coil or load coil. Coreless coils are used for Tx and Rx coils to examine the characteristics of CMRS with lumped transformers. A detailed static analysis on the explicit circuit model of the proposed CMRS and design procedures are fully established. Experiments for 1- and 10-W prototype CMRSs with a class-E inverter at the switching frequency of 500 kHz, where the quality factors are less than 100, verified the usefulness of the proposed model, achieving 80% of the maximum Tx coil-to-load efficiency. It is concluded in this paper that the conventional CMRS, in general, is just a special form of an inductive power transfer system where the quality factor is extremely high.</P>"

quantification of nitrate sources in groundwater using hydrochemical and dual isotopic data combined with a bayesian mixing model,2015,"['Rural groundwater', 'South Korea', 'Nitrate', 'Dual isotopes', 'Hydrochemical parameters', 'Orthogonal regression of PCA', 'Bayesian mixing model (MixSIR)']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"To determine the contributions of various sources to nitrate loads in groundwater (n=103) from three farmed rural sites in South Korea, we assessed the dual isotopic composition of nitrate, coupled with hydrochemical parameters.

To overcome the known uncertainties of quantitative source apportionment for groundwater nitrate, arising from isotope fractionation during N transformations and the significant overlap in isotopic values of different sources, the combined hydrochemical and isotopic datasets were interpreted with orthogonal regression of a principal component analysis (PCA) and a Bayesian mixing model. The PCA projected the observed δ<SUP>15</SUP>N<SUB>NO'3</SUB> values onto a mixing subspace in the multivariate variability of the dataset, and the regression fits of the sample data were presumed to be conservative mixtures. This procedure also allowed for an assessment of the sample uncertainty, as influenced by natural nitrate contributions and denitrification. The Bayesian mixing model was used to estimate the probability distributions of the proportional contributions of three anthropogenic sources: chemical fertilizers, composted manure, and manure slurries. Nitrate is largely derived from chemical fertilizers with fractional contributions of 0.35-0.71, and organic fertilizers including composted manure with mixing fractions of 0.39-0.49. The relative contribution of nitrate from composted manure compared to chemical fertilizers increased with increasing nitrate concentrations, suggesting that composted manure significantly increases nitrate pollution and therefore its use should be carefully controlled to manage rural groundwater quality. This study also suggests that PCA and Bayesian isotope mixing models are effective for quantitative assessment of the sources of pollutants, such as nitrate."

In this context, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has to be credited as one of major ‘change elements’ which enable to drive constructive changes in a working environment and arrangement in an organization, that enable employees to work from anywhere, at any time around the globe and across geographical boundaries regardless of differences in languages, cultures and time zones. The new transformation indirectly demands significant challenges to the organization in order to conform the needs and necessities for these current working practices. The challenges include ICT investment in the infrastructure and applications particularly to overcome the communication and collaboration barrier, which is the result of lack of social, physical and face-to-face interaction. However, it is occasionally difficult to find the best model to support services that can suit the needs of virtual team work or telework in certain domain. The primary objective of this study is to develop a model for distributed working group that supports unified communication and collaboration, particularly in the context of public sector in Malaysia. The sample consists of 92 respondents from the Malaysia Ministry of Rural and Regional Development (MRRD) and the Rural Transformation Centres (RTC). The statistical analysis found that among the main features that meet the needs of the group work are, the ability to share and access the information, the capability to submit reports periodically and provides an interactive environment. The unified communication and collaboration model proposed by this study focuses on synchronous and asynchronous activities. In this model, the ultimate goals of telework are defined and categorised into three groups of users which are the individual, team work and organisation."
design of nonlinear model predictive control with application to regenerative thermal oxidizer system,2015,"['Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO)', 'nonlinear model predictive control', 'Wiener model', 'Hammerstein model', 'quadratic optimization']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO) is a treatment process of exhaust air. The RTO system absorbs heat from the exhaust gas and uses the captured heat to preheat the incoming gas stream and destroy air pollutants emitted from process exhaust streams at high temperatures. In order to regulate the gas stream output, temperature control loop is an important requirement. This paper presents an application of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) designed for RTO system. Applying the Wiener and Hammerstein model to NMPC can transform the design criterion into a quadratic function. The performance of NMPC based on Wiener and Hammerstein model is compared to linear MPC. Effects of each control parameter are also obtained. Simulation results indicate that NMPC provides better transient performance while error converges to zero."
a model on the rise and decline of south korean anti-american sentiment,2015,"['anti-American sentiment', 'South Korea', 'generational effect', 'period effect', 'candle light vigil', 'cognitive basis', 'emotional incidents']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Most of the literature on the 2002 candlelight vigils in South Korea (Korea) has ascribed the cause of the anti-Americanism of these protests to domestic factors. Authors predicted that any change in United States policy on Korea would not substantially improve the two countries’ strained alliance because the fundamental problem was rooted in Korea’s domestic transformation and subsequent shifts in perspective towards North Korea. However, South Korea has once again become one of the world’s most pro-American countries. This study claims that South Korea’s domestic transformation is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to give rise to anti-American protest and thus anti-American sentiment is merely latent in the South Korean public consciousness and will not manifest itself unless it is ill-managed. A comprehensive analytical model is presented to predict the rise and decline of anti-American protest, incorporating period as well as generational effect. The model depicts the dynamic process of mass demonstrations in which cognitive basis and emotional incidents interact."

For this purpose, five different stress states were considered; i.e., uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression, equi-biaxial tension, plane strain tension and simple shear. A range of temperatures from room to 100 degrees C for each stress state condition except the simple shear test were investigated. In particular, for the equi-biaxial tension data in warm conditions, a specially designed hydraulic bulge experiment was adopted. In situ magnetic measurements were performed to monitor the evolution of the martensitic content throughout each experiment. A stress state and temperature dependent transformation kinetics law was proposed, which incorporates a non-linear function of the stress triaxiality, Lode angle parameter and temperature. This new model captures the measured martensitic phase transformation kinetics of TRIP780 steel over a wide range of stress states and temperature reasonably well. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc.

development of a tire model based on an analysis of tire strain obtained by an intelligent tire system,2015,"['Intelligent tire system', 'Tire model', 'Tire strain', 'Simulation', 'Tire contact patch']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Tires perform important roles, such as supporting weight and generating forces during accelerating or braking.However, the direct acquisition of valuable data from tires is limited because of the nonlinearity and complex composition of tires. Recently, an intelligent tire system was developed to obtain tire-related variables directly from tire strain. The strain of the tire is measured using a strain sensor; strain is then transformed to other valuable variables, such as the vertical load and the road friction coefficient. However, to develop the conversion logic needed to obtain tire-related variables from the strain, costly and extensive experiments are needed. In this study, we propose a novel tire model and an intelligent tire simulation to reduce the effort and cost for developing an intelligent tire system. Based on experimental data, a tire model, one that can reflect the relationships between driving conditions and tire strain, was derived. And, using a set of polynomial equations comprised of the decisive parameters, a simple algebraic model was developed to yield light computational load. Finally, it was verified that the proposed tire model can correctly estimate not only the tire strain but also the 1st differential values of tire strain."

automated generation of a digital elevation model over steep terrain in antarctica from high-resolution satellite imagery,2015,"['stereo matching', 'Antarctic', 'digital elevation model (DEM)', 'epipolar', 'image patch']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The automated generation of a digital elevation model over the Antarctic using stereo matching high-resolution satellite images is a challenging task. Moreover, the homogeneous radiometry in the icy environment and the strong geometric dissimilarity between stereo pairs over the steep terrain limit the use of area-based matching techniques. To overcome this issue, we propose template matching with image transformation in order to reduce the geometric dissimilarity. First, we generated epipolar resampled images to ensure the ease of estimation and handling of image dissimilarities from various viewing directions. We then utilized the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and transformed the image patches within the matching window along the sample, line, and diagonal directions in order to improve the match rates within the steep areas. Furthermore, we tested the proposed method using Antarctic IKONOS stereo images and found that the overall matching success rate improved from 93.5% to 97.0% for all image pixels. We then computed the success rates over an area in which the NCC produced a low elevation point density and observed a more significant improvement from 58.7% to 79.26%. When compared to the manually generated elevation, the maximum vertical difference improved from 11.4 to 4.7 m. With these improvements, we can build a 1-m resolution elevation model over the glaciated high relief terrain.</P>"

It obtains the posterior distributions using a joint distribution composed of a likelihood function and prior distributions of unknown inputs in the Bayesian paradigm. In other words, it provides higher benefits in terms of a stochastic approach than the deterministic calibration and the feasibility of their calibrated results was sufficiently discussed. However, challenging issues in Bayesian calibration still remains as follows: (1) inappropriate selection of prior distributions, (2) truncated sample dataset of the likelihood functions. The aforementioned issues can increase the risks of Bayesian calibration. This paper aims to inform the risks of Bayesian calibration associated with the aforementioned issues through a reference case study. For this study, the Gaussian Process (GP) emulator, which can be regarded as a meta-model of Building Performance Simulation (BPS) tools, was used to reduce the simulation run-time. Bayesian calibration using the GP emulator was implemented with what-if scenarios considering the aforementioned issues. And then the validated models were used for a stochastic retrofit analysis of glazing systems. With the results of the estimated posterior distributions, validation, and stochastic retrofit, this paper presents Bayesian calibration issues regarding the selection of prior distributions and sample dataset of the likelihood functions."

However, the empirical processes have limitations on the expanded requirements of frequent and systematic rail grinding. Therefore, it is necessary to build up the rail grinding model to fill the gap between the operating parameters and desired on-the-ground results. In this paper, a three-dimensional distribution model has been built to get a uniform special-distribution for grains and extract one slice as the representative grinding surface, with decahedrons grains transformed from spheres. Then the cutting force model and then related power model have been achieved based on the formed grinding surface with information of grains geometry and their locations. Calculation results show that the consumed power or the consumed energy have a close relationship with grinding speeds and grinding forces, which are closely related to the grain geometry, involved grain numbers, location of grains and their cutting depth. And it comes to a conclusion that a judgment for energy-saved grinding strategy depends on the grinding aims."

application of sfcl on bus tie for parallel operation of power main transformers in a fuel cell power systems,2015,"['DG interconnection', 'Parallel operation', 'Fuel cell', 'SFCL', 'Protection']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In the power plant using high temperature fuel cells such as Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell(MCFC), and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell(SOFC), the generated electric power per area of power generation facilities is much higher than any other renewable energy sources. - High temperature fuel cell systems are capable of operating at MW rated power output. - It also has a feature that is short for length of the line for connecting the interior of the generation facilities. In normal condition, these points are advantages for voltage drops or power losses. However, in abnormal condition such as fault occurrence in electrical system, the fault currents are increased, because of the small impedance of the short length of power cable. Commonly, to minimize the thermal-mechanical stresses on the stack and increase the systems reliability, we divided the power plant configuration to several banks for parallel operation. However, when a fault occurs in the parallel operation system of power main transformer, the fault currents might exceed the interruption capacity of protective devices. In fact, although the internal voltage level of the fuel cell power plant is the voltage level of distribution systems, we should install the circuit breakers for transmission systems due to fault current. To resolve these problems, the SFCL has been studied as one of the noticeable devices. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of application of the SFCL on bus tie in a fuel cell power plants system using PSCAD/EMTDC."

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of rose placenta from R. damascena in a full-thickness wound model in mice.Methods Sixty six-week-old C57BL/6N mice were used. Full-thickness wounds were made with an 8-mm diameter punch. Two wounds were made on each side of the back, and wounds were assigned randomly to the control and experimental groups. Rose placenta (250 μg) was injected in the experimental group, and normal saline was injected in the control group.Wound sizes were measured with digital photography, and specimens were harvested.Immunohistochemical staining was performed to assess the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and CD31. Vessel density was measured. Quantitative analysis using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for EGF was performed. All evaluations were performed on postoperative days 0, 2, 4, 7, and 10. Statistical analyses were performed using the paired t-test.Results On days 4, 7, and 10, the wounds treated with rose placenta were significantly smaller.On day 2, VEGF and EGF expression increased in the experimental group. On days 7 and 10, TGF-β1 expression decreased in the experimental group. On day 10, vessel density increased in the experimental group. The increase in EGF on day 2 was confirmed with ELISA.Conclusions Rose placenta was found to be associated with improved wound healing in a mouse full-thickness wound model via increased EGF release. Rose placenta may potentially be a novel drug candidate for enhancing wound healing."

This paper tries to investigate the effects of seismic load combinations on the behavior of slabs at their connection zones with the shear walls. These connection zones naturally are the most critical regions of the slabs in RC buildings.

antiallergic effects of trichostatin a in a murine model of allergic rhinitis,2015,"['Allergic Rhinitis', 'Trichostatin A', 'Histone Deacetylases', 'Ovalbumin', 'Mice']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objectives. Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, has been shown to play an important role in attenuating asthmatic inflammation. However, the effect of TSA in allergic rhinitis is not known. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of TSA on allergic nasal inflammation and on the induction of regulatory T cells in a murine model of allergic rhinitis. Methods. BALB/c mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin (OVA) and then challenged intranasally with OVA. TSA (1 mg/kg) was given to the treatment group, and multiple parameters of allergic responses were evaluated to determine the effects of TSA on allergic rhinitis. Allergic nasal symptom scores, including frequency of rubbing and sneezing, were checked. Eosinophil infiltrations were stained with Chromotrope 2R, and the expression levels of OVA-specific IgE, T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokine (interferon-gamma [IFN-γ]), Th2 cytokines (interleukin [IL] 4 and IL-5) and Treg (Foxp3, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-beta [TGF-β]) were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. TSA reduced the scores of allergic nasal symptoms and the amount of eosinophil infiltration into the nasal mucosa. TSA suppressed OVA-specific IgE levels and reduced expression of the IL-4 and IL-5. However, the expression of IFN-γ was unchanged in the treatment group. The levels of Foxp3, IL-10, and TGF-β were increased in pretreatment with TSA as compared to control group. Conclusion. This study shows that TSA induced antiallergic effects by decreasing eosinophilic infiltration and Th2 cytokines in a murine model of allergic rhinitis via regulation of Tregs. Thus, TSA may be considered a potentially therapeutic agent in treating allergic rhinitis."

heat shock protein 90 inhibitor decreases collagen synthesis of keloid fibroblasts and attenuates the extracellular matrix on the keloid spheroid model,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"BACKGROUND:: The 90-kDa heat-shock protein (heat-shock protein 90) is an abundant cytosolic chaperone, and inhibition of heat-shock protein 90 by 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) compromises transforming growth factor (TGF)-&bgr–mediated transcriptional responses by enhancing TGF-&bgr receptor I and II degradation, thus preventing Smad2/3 activation. In this study, the authors evaluated whether heat-shock protein 90 regulates TGF-&bgr signaling in the pathogenesis and treatment of keloids. METHODS:: Keloid fibroblasts were treated with 17-AAG (10 μM), and mRNA levels of collagen types I and III were determined by real-time reverse- transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Also, secreted TGF-&bgr1 was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effect of 17-AAG on protein levels of Smad2/3 complex was determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, in 17-AAG–treated keloid spheroids, the collagen deposition and expression of major extracellular matrix proteins were investigated by means of Masson trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS:: The authors found that heat-shock protein 90 is overexpressed in human keloid tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue, and 17-AAG decreased mRNA levels of type I collagen, secreted TGF-ß1, and Smad2/3 complex protein expression in keloid fibroblasts. Masson trichrome staining revealed that collagen deposition was decreased in 17-AAG–treated keloid spheroids, and immunohistochemical analysis showed that expression of collagen types I and III, elastin, and fibronectin was markedly decreased in 17-AAG–treated keloid spheroids. CONCLUSION:: These results suggest that the antifibrotic action of heat-shock protein 90 inhibitors such as 17-AAG may have therapeutic effects on keloids."

Mozambique drew scholarly attention as it maintained 7% average GDP growth since 2000, achieved both economic growth and political stability, and drove HCI-centered manufacturing industrial transformation rather than using its static comparative advantage from abundant natural resources. Some features of East Asian developmental model are also found in the Mozambican case: state capacity during democratization and privatization through political coalition with the vested interest, and active governmental intervention in industrial transformation with industrial policy to create dynamic comparative advantage. However, embedded autonomy of East Asian model was weak as cooperation network between the state and the society was captured by the vested interest. Furthermore, the Mozambican government preferred joint ventures with MNCs over domestic companies in promoting industrial transformation. As a result, unlike East Asia, the industrial transformation was not linked to further development of other domestic industries."

The driving data are collected by using the three-dimensional driving simulator based on CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment(CAVE), which provides stereoscope immersive virtual environment. In our modeling, the control scenario of the human driver, that is, the mapping from the driver`s sensory information to the operation of the driver such as acceleration, braking and steering, is expressed by Piecewise Linear (PWL) model. Since the PWL model includes both continuous behavior given by polynomials and discrete logical conditions, it can be regarded as a class of Hybrid Dynamical System(HDS). The identification problem for the PWL model is formulated as the Mixed Integer Linear Programming(MILP) by transforming the switching conditions into binary variables. From the obtained results, it is found that the driver appropriately switches the ``control law`` according to the sensory information. These results enable us to capture not only the physical meaning of the driving skill, but also the decision-making aspect(switching conditions) in the driver`s stopping maneuver."

This study suggests use of concept models as a mediation means by which to apply the design concept used for spatial design process to space. This study aims to interpret the abstract concept of spatial design as a 3-D concept model, by mediation of which to suggest educational methods applying it to spatial design, and to analyze usability & types of concept models. Through this, effective educational methods enabling more creative spatial design are explored. Result of this study shows that the utilization of concept models is found useful to students learning spatial design. 5 categories of methods by which to express design concepts in the form of concept models are analyzed; morphologization via motifs, embodiment of linguistic meanings, imagery transformation, embodiment of a process/situation and convergent interpretation in conjunction to other fields(music, literature, IT). These results reveal the advantage that morphological interpretation via conceptual models eases the formative expression of space design, and that it eases the difficulty beginners learning spatial design have. It also has an advantage that learners can have formative studies in relatively liberal manner, freed of large-scale pressure imposed upon them by space. Accordingly, result of this study shows a possibility that conceptual models can be utilized as an effective tool for education of spatial design."

Social networked journalism allows the public to be involved in every aspect of journalism production through crowd-sourcing and interactivity. The networking effect with the public is driving journalism to transform into a more open, more networked and more responsive venue. “wikitree” is a social networking news service on which anybody can write news and disseminate it via Facebook and Twitter. It is operated as an open sourced program which incorporates “Google Translate” to automatically convert all its content, enabling any global citizen with an Internet access to contribute news production and share either their own creative contents or generated contents from other sources. Since its inception, “wikitree global” site has been expanding its coverage rapidly with access points arising from 160 countries. Analyzing its international coverage by country and by news category as well as by the unique visit numbers via SNS, the results of the case study imply that networking with the global public can enhance news traffic to the social news site as well as to specific news items. The results also suggest that the utilization of Twitter and Facebook in social networked journalism can break the boundary between local and global public by extending news-gathering ability while growing audience`s interest in the site, and engender a feasible business model for a local online journalism."

Also, we evaluated chemical relations and their variations among major trophic variables such as total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) and determined intense summer monsoon and annual precipitation effects on algal growth using empirical regression model. Stream water quality of TN, TP, and other parameters degradated toward the downstreams, and especially was largely impacted by point-sources of wastewater disposal plants near Jungrang Stream. In contrast, summer river runoff and rainwater improved the stream water quality of TP, TN, and ionic contents, measured as conductivity (EC) in the downstream reach. Empirical linear regression models of log-transformed CHL-a against log-transformed TN, TP, and TN:TP mass ratios in five reservoirs indicated that the variation of TP accounted 33.8% (R2=0.338, p<0.001, slope=0.710) in the variation of CHL-a and the variation of TN accounted only 21.4% (R2=0.214, p<0.001) in the CHL-a. Overall, our study suggests that, primary productions, estimated as CHL-a, were more determined by ambient phosphorus loading rather than nitrogen in the lentic systems of artificial reservoirs, and the stream water quality as lotic ecosystems were more influenced by a point-source locations of tributary streams and intense seasonal rainfall rather than a presence of artificial dam reservoirs along the main axis of the watershed."

Statistical and numerical analysis methods are used to provide more accurate and faster information based on velocity, variety, and volume to the field where the concept of big data is applied. In the financial services industry, big data technologies help us to understand customer behavior and assess risk. Within the insurance industry, the automobile insurance sector in particular is well-suited to the application of big data. More than 20 million cars are insured in Korea, where minimum levels of auto insurance coverage are compulsory. Since this is a short-term insurance, data must be collected, updated, and analyzed every year. Owing to the recent development of OBD (on board diagnostics), driving habits or driving behaviors can be digitalized daily by installing a simple device on the vehicle. Data can be transmitted by the use of a mobile device in real time back to the insurance company for analysis. The conventional approach of analyzing data based on annual data collected throughout the year has now been transformed to real time analysis, with the ability to determine daily risk. This means that big data transmitted from each vehicle daily must be analyzed. This study aims to examine how leading global insurance companies manage real time data, determine risk, and apply findings to a real world situation.

This study presents a new model to predict the transient behavior of the liquid and solid slag layers. Unlike the previous steady-state model, the solid slag layer was included in solving the governing equations in order to identify the temporal and spatial transformation between the solid-liquid slag, rather than treating the solid region as a boundary condition of the liquid layer. The performance of the new model was evaluated for changes in the slag deposition rate (±10 %) and gas temperature (±50 K) in a simple cylindrical gasifier. The results show that the characteristic times to reach a new steady-state ranged between 80 s to 180s for the changes in the two parameters. Because the characteristic times of the gasifier temperature and slag deposition rate by changes in the coal type and/or operating conditions would be almost instantaneous, the time-scale for the slag thickness at the bottom of the gasifier to stabilize was much larger."

Nevertheless, the nonlinear effects involved in the roll motion of ship and offshore structures are not only incompletely understood, but also inaccurately predicted during the design stage. Therefore, efforts have been made to identify the dynamic characteristics of the roll motion of a FPSO using a novel dynamic system identification scheme based upon the Hilbert transform. First, the system identification scheme using the Hilbert transform was applied to the idealized single DOF nonlinear oscillator problem with quadratic damping and quintic stiffness terms. The solution of the single DOF problem was solved numerically using the 4th order Runge–Kutta method and the target damping and stiffness coefficients were determined by applying the Hilbert transform to the numerically obtained free decay signal. A comparison was also made with traditional logarithmic decrement technique for the damping coefficient. Second, the system identification method was applied to the model test results of a FPSO with a bilge keel, where the nonlinear effect of roll damping and restoring is expected to be dominant.

discrete wavelet transform-based denoising technique for advanced state-of-charge estimator of a lithium-ion battery in electric vehicles,2015,"['Discrete wavelet transform', 'Denoising', 'State-of-charge', 'Equivalent circuit model', 'Extended Kalman filter']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Sophisticated data of the experimental DCV (discharging/charging voltage) of a lithium-ion battery is required for high-accuracy SOC (state-of-charge) estimation algorithms based on the state-space ECM (electrical circuit model) in BMSs (battery management systems). However, when sensing noisy DCV signals, erroneous SOC estimation (which results in low BMS performance) is inevitable. Therefore, this manuscript describes the design and implementation of a DWT (discrete wavelet transform)-based denoising technique for DCV signals. The steps for denoising a noisy DCV measurement in the proposed approach are as follows. First, using MRA (multi-resolution analysis), the noise-riding DCV signal is decomposed into different frequency sub-bands (low- and high-frequency components, <I>A</I> <SUB> <I>n</I> </SUB> and <I>D</I> <SUB> <I>n</I> </SUB>). Specifically, signal processing of the high frequency component <I>D</I> <SUB> <I>n</I> </SUB> that focuses on a short-time interval is necessary to reduce noise in the DCV measurement. Second, a hard-thresholding-based denoising rule is applied to adjust the wavelet coefficients of the DWT to achieve a clear separation between the signal and the noise. Third, the desired de-noised DCV signal is reconstructed by taking the IDWT (inverse discrete wavelet transform) of the filtered detailed coefficients. Finally, this signal is sent to the ECM-based SOC estimation algorithm using an EKF (extended Kalman filter).

transient negative-sequence component calculation for large generator based on wavelet transform,2015,"['negative-sequence component', 'transient current analysis', 'large generator', 'wavelet transform', 'internal short circuit fault']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The current in frequency domain can not be analyzed at the same time because of the limitations of the Fourier transform algorithm.

Then, the non-periodic component and periodic component fundamental wave of the transient current are obtained, and the high harmonic components and decreased periodic component are removed. The non-periodic component is seriously considered in the transient negative-sequence component calculation. The calculation results indicate that the transient negative-sequence component contains two parts, the equivalent negative-sequence component of non-periodic component and the negative-sequence component of negative-sequence current. The world's first AP1000 third generation 1250 MVA nuclear half-speed (4-pole) turbo-generator is adopted as the calculation model. The transient parameters of the large generator are calculated on the principle of transformed current waveform in the internal short circuit fault condition.

Materials and Methods: Survival curves were digitized and the survival proportions and times were extracted and modeled to appropriate covariates by two multivariate mixed effects models. Studies which reported disease free survival and overall survival curves for anthracycline-based or CMF as adjuvant chemotherapy that were published in English in the Eastern Mediterranean region and Asia were included in this systematic review. The two transformations of survival probabilities (Ln (-Ln(S)) and Ln(S/ (1-S))) as dependent variables were modeled by a multivariate mixed model to same covariates in order to have precise estimations with high power and appropriate interpretation of covariate effects. The analysis was carried out with SAS Proc MIXED and STATA software. Results: A total of 32 studies from the published literature were analysed, covering 4,092 patients who received anthracycline-based and 2,501 treated with CMF for the disease free survival and in order to analyze the overall survival, 13 studies reported the overall survival curves in which 2,050 cases were treated with anthracycline-based and 1,282 with CMF regimens. Conclusions: The findings illustrated that the model with dependent variable Ln (-Ln(S)) had more precise estimations of the covariate effects and showed significant difference between the effects of two adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. Anthracycline-based treatment gave better disease free survival and overall survival. As an IPD meta-analysis in the Italy the results of Angelo et al in 2011 also confirmed that anthracycline-based regimens were more effective for survival of breast cancer patients.

Stream water quality of TN, TP, and other parameters degradated toward the downstreams, and especially was largely impacted by point-sources of wastewater disposal plants near Jungrang Stream. In contrast, summer river runoff and rainwater improved the stream water quality of TP, TN, and ionic contents, measured as conductivity (EC) in the downstream reach. Empirical linear regression models of log-transformed CHL-a against log-transformed TN, TP, and TN:TP mass ratios in five reservoirs indicated that the variation of TP accounted 33.8% (R2=0.338, p<0.001, slope=0.710) in the variation of CHL-a and the variation of TN accounted only 21.4% (R2=0.214, p<0.001) in the CHL-a. Overall, our study suggests that, primary productions, estimated as CHL-a, were more determined by ambient phosphorus loading rather than nitrogen in the lentic systems of artificial reservoirs, and the stream water quality as lotic ecosystems were more influenced by a point-source locations of tributary streams and intense seasonal rainfall rather than a presence of artificial dam reservoirs along the main axis of the watershed."

kaempferol suppresses transforming growth factor-β1–induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and migration of a549 lung cancer cells by inhibiting akt1-mediated phosphorylation of smad3 at threonine-179 <sup>1</sup>,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Kaempferol, a natural dietary flavonoid, is well known to possess chemopreventive and therapeutic anticancer efficacy; however, its antimetastatic effects have not been mechanistically studied so far in any cancer model. This study was aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect and accompanying mechanisms of kaempferol on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). In human A549 non–small lung cancer cells, kaempferol strongly blocked the enhancement of cell migration by TGF-β1–induced EMT through recovering the loss of E-cadherin and suppressing the induction of mesenchymal markers as well as the upregulation of TGF-β1–mediated matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity. Interestingly, kaempferol reversed TGF-β1–mediated Snail induction and E-cadherin repression by weakening Smad3 binding to the Snail promoter without affecting its C-terminus phosphorylation, complex formation with Smad4, and nuclear translocation under TGF-β1 stimulation. Mechanism study revealed that the phosphorylation of Smad3 linker region induced by TGF-β1 was required for the induction of EMT and cell migration, and selective downregulation of the phosphorylation of Smad3 at Thr179 residue (not Ser204, Ser208, and Ser213) in the linker region was responsible for the inhibition by kaempferol of TGF-β1–induced EMT and cell migration. Furthermore, Akt1 was required for TGF-β1–mediated induction of EMT and cell migration and directly phosphorylated Smad3 at Thr179, and kaempferol completely abolished TGF-β1–induced Akt1 phosphorylation. In summary, kaempferol blocks TGF-β1–induced EMT and migration of lung cancer cells by inhibiting Akt1-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3 at Thr179 residue, providing the first evidence of a molecular mechanism for the anticancer effect of kaempferol.</P>"

Further, the feasibility of prediction modeling of carotenoid content by multivariate statistical analysis combined with FT-IR spectral and HPLC data was examined without additional HPLC analysis. FT-IR spectra of citrus (Citrus unshiu Marc. cv. Miyagawa) fruit peels and flesh were measured at monthly intervals of fruit development. Quantification of carotenoids from the fruit was confirmed by quantitative HPLC analysis. The most remarkable evolution of FT-IR spectral decrease during ripening of fruit was found in the amide region (1500–1700 cm-1), whereas there was an increase in the carbohydrate region (1000–1200 cm-1). The evolution of different FT-IR spectral bands was related to fruit constituents, including organic acids, carbohydrates, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds. Significant qualitative changes in the carotenoid pattern included an increase in bcryptoxanthin and decrease in lutein content during citrus fruit development. The content of antheraxanthin (R2 = 0.9117), β-carotene (R2 = 0.8816), β-cryptoxanthin (R2 = 0.8856), and violaxanthin (R2 = 0.7305) from peels of citrus fruit could be predicted from FT-IR spectral data using partial least square (PLS) regression modeling. Considering the results of PLS-discriminant analysis (PLSDA) of FT-IR spectral data and PLS regression modeling of carotenoid content, FT-IR in combination with multivariate analysis enables not only discrimination of metabolic variation during fruit development, but also prediction of carotenoid content from citrus fruit."

From the analysis of SMC X-1, we obtained a Hilbert spectrum that shows more detailed information in both the time and frequency domains. Then, a phase-resolved analysis of both the spectra and the orbital profiles was presented. From the spectral analysis, we noticed that the iron line production is dominated by different regions of this binary system in different superorbital phases. Furthermore, a pre-eclipse dip lying at orbital phase ~0:6-0:85 was discovered during the superorbital transition state. We further applied the HHT to analyze the QPO of RE J1034+396. From the Hilbert spectrum and the O-C analysis results, we suggest that it is better to divide the evolution of the QPO into three epochs according to their different periodicities. The correlations between the QPO periods and corresponding fluxes were also different in these three epochs. The change in periodicity and the relationships could be interpreted as the change in oscillation mode based on the diskoseismology model."

In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of CEPO against transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. MDCK cells were treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/mL) for 48 h to induce EMT, and the cells were then co-treated with TGF-β1 and CEPO or recombinant human EPO for another 48 h. Increased expressions of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and decreased expressions of E-cadherin were observed after TGF-β1 treatment, and these changes were markedly attenuated by CEPO co-treatment. TGF-β1 increased phosphorylated Smad-2 expression in MDCK cells, which was decreased by CEPO cotreatment. The results indicate that CEPO ameliorates the TGF-β1-induced EMT mediated by p-Smad2 pathway. It suggests that CEPO has therapeutic potential in chronic kidney disease."

To achieve the biomass based energy generation, transformed microalgae with superlative properties should be developed through genetic engineering. Contrary to the normal cells, microalgae have rigid cell walls, so that target gene delivery into cells is challengeable. In this study, we report a ZnO nanowire-incorporated microdevice for a high throughput microalgal transformation. The proposed microdevice was equipped with not only a ZnO nanowire in the microchannel for gene delivery into cells but also a pneumatic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microvalve to modulate the cellular attachment and detachment from the nanowire. As a model, hygromycin B resistance gene cassette (Hyg3) was functionalized on the hydrothermally grown ZnO nanowires through a disulfide bond and released into green algal cells, <I>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</I>, by reductive cleavage. During Hyg3 gene delivery, a monolithic PDMS membrane was bent down, so that algal cells were pushed down toward ZnO nanowires. The supply of vacuum in the pneumatic line made the PDMS membrane bend up, enabling the gene delivered algal cells to be recovered from the outlet of the microchannel. We successfully confirmed Hyg3 gene integrated in microalgae by amplifying the inserted gene through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. The efficiency of the gene delivery to algal cells using the ZnO nanowire-incorporated microdevice was 6.52 × 10<SUP>4</SUP>- and 9.66 × 10<SUP>4</SUP>-fold higher than that of a traditional glass bead beating and electroporation.</P><P><B>Graphic Abstract</B><IMG SRC='http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/aamick/2015/aamick.2015.7.issue-49/acsami.5b09964/production/images/medium/am-2015-09964v_0008.gif'></P><P><A href='http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/am5b09964'>ACS Electronic Supporting Info</A></P>"

In this study, weexamined whether expression of TLR4 and TLR5 was associated with progression of prostate transformation in the transgenic adenocarcinomaof mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. The expression of TLR4 and TLR5 was evaluated by immunohistochemisty in formalin-fixedparaffin-embedded prostate tissue from wild-type (WT) and TRAMP mice. Normal prostate tissue from WT mice showed strong expressionof TLR4 and TLR5. However, TLR4 expression in the prostate tissue from TRAMP mice gradually decreased as pathologic grade becamemore aggressive. TLR5 expression in the prostate tissue from TRAMP mice also decreased in low-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia(PIN), high-grade PIN and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Overall, our results suggest that decreased expression of TLR4 and TLR5may contribute to prostate tumorigenesis."

Further this paper presents a novel method with combination of ICA, information sharing and double density wavelet transform to reject the artifacts from the signal. The Independent Component Analysis (ICA) here is used to segment artifact peaks in the signal. Then the Discrete Wavelet Transform is applied for multi-level transfer of signal data until the reception of significant result.

The E2-CD81 interaction leads to B cell proliferation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation and to the hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes. Epidemiological studies have reported a high prevalence of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in HCV-positive patients, suggesting a potential association between HCV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the genesis of B lymphocyte proliferative disorders. In the present study, in order to investigate the association between EBV and HCV in B cells, we created an <I>in vitro</I> EBV-induced B cell transformation model. CD81 was gradually overexpressed during transformation by EBV. B cells isolated from HCV-positive patients grew more rapidly and clumped together earlier than B cells isolated from healthy donors following EBV infection. Pre-stimulation of CD81 expressed by resting B cells with anti-CD81 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or HCV E2 accelerated the generation of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) by EBV infection. These cells proliferated prominently through the early expression of interleukin-10 and intracellular latent membrane protein (LMP)-l. By contrast, the overexpression of CD81 on EBV-transformed B cells by anti-CD81 mAb or HCV E2 protein induced apoptosis through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. These results suggest that the engagement of CD81 expressed by B cells has differential effects on B cell fate (proliferation or apoptosis) according to EBV infection and the expression level of CD81.</P>"
modeling and controller design for a series-connected output universal link converter,2015,"['solid-state transformer (SST)', 'AC&#x2013']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>This paper conducts modeling and controller design for a SEries-connected Output Universal Link (SEOUL) converter. The SEOUL converter was proposed to interface multiple distributed power sources to the grid with a reduced amount of reactive components. It employs a high-frequency (HF) transformer instead of a bulky line-frequency transformer like solid-state transformers (SSTs). In addition, it does not use a large dc-link capacitor at the input side and reduces the size of the input filter. This is inherently possible due to its original operating characteristic. The input phase current is not actively controlled but synthesized indirectly by HF power transfer between input and output sides of the SEOUL converter. Therefore, it is important to properly control the HF power transfer part, on which this paper focuses. An analytic model is developed, and a control strategy is proposed based on the model with a decoupling control method. The developed model and the proposed control method were verified by experiments.</P>"

A large variety of integral transforms can be put into particular forms of the H-transform since H-functions subsume most of the known special functions including Meijer's G-functions. In this paper, we embody the H-transform theory into a unifying framework for modeling and analysis in wireless communication. First, we systematize the use of elementary identities and properties of the H-transform by introducing operations on parameter sequences of H-functions. We then put forth H-fading and degree-2 irregular H-fading to model radio propagation under composite, specular, and/or inhomogeneous conditions. The H-fading describes composite effects of multipath fading and shadowing as a single H-variate, including most of typical models such as Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Weibull, alpha-mu, N* Nakagami-m, (generalized) K-fading, and Weibull/gamma fading as its special cases. As a new class of H-variates (called the degree-zeta irregular H-variate), the degree-2 irregular H-fading characterizes specular and/or inhomogeneous radio propagation in which the multipath component consists of a strong specularly reflected or line-of-sight (LOS) wave as well as unequal-power or correlated in-phase and quadrature scattered waves. This fading includes a variety of typical models such as Rician, Nakagami-q, kappa-mu, eta-mu, Rician/LOS gamma, and kappa-mu/LOS gamma fading as its special cases. Finally, we develop a unifying H-transform analysis for the amount of fading, error probability, channel capacity, and error exponent in wireless communication using the new systematic language of transcendental H-functions. By virtue of two essential operations-called Mellin and convolution operations-involved in the Mellin transform and Mellin convolution of two H-functions, the H-transforms for these performance measures culminate in H-functions. Using the algebraic asymptotic expansions of the H-transform, we further analyze the error probability and capacity at high and low signal-to-noise ratios in a unified fashion.</P>"

modeling and direct power control method of vienna rectifiers using the sliding mode control approach,2015,"['Direct power control (DPC)', 'Power model', 'Sliding mode control (SMC)', 'Vienna-type rectifier']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper uses the switching function approach to present a simple state model of the Vienna-type rectifier. The approach introduces the relationship between the DC-link neutral point voltage and the AC side phase currents. A novel direct power control (DPC) strategy, which is based on the sliding mode control (SMC) for Vienna I rectifiers, is developed using the proposed power model in the stationary α-β reference frames. The SMC-based DPC methodology directly regulates instantaneous active and reactive powers without transforming to a synchronous rotating coordinate reference frame or a tracking phase angle of grid voltage. Moreover, the required rectifier control voltages are directly calculated by utilizing the non-linear SMC scheme. Theoretically, active and reactive power flows are controlled without ripple or cross coupling. Furthermore, the fixed-switching frequency is obtained by employing the simplified space vector modulation (SVM). SVM solves the complicated designing problem of the AC harmonic filter. The simplified SVM is based on the simplification of the space vector diagram of a three-level converter into that of a two-level converter. The dwelling time calculation and switching sequence selection are easily implemented like those in the conventional two-level rectifier. Replacing the current control loops with power control loops simplifies the system design and enhances the transient performance. The simulation models in MATLAB/Simulink and the digital signal processor-controlled 1.5 kW Vienna-type rectifier are used to verify the fast responses and robustness of the proposed control scheme."
modeling of micro-scale fiber laser hardening process and optimization via statistical approximation of the engineering models,2015,"['Laser transformation hardening', 'Modeling of micro-scale laser hardening', 'Hardness', 'Optimization']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Laser transformation hardening is effective technique used for selective hardening of components such as turbine blade, camshafts and gears. Laser hardening provides benefits over other selective hardening processes in terms of thermal distortion, control of process and appearance of component. The fiber laser is relatively recent development. The single/low mode fiber lasers have good beam quality, high wall plug efficiency, fiber delivery and powers up to few hundred watts. The beam quality of single mode fiber lasers enable it to be focused to a spot size of few tens of mm which can yield hardened tracks of 100 to 500 mm. These fiber lasers can be extremely useful in localized micro-scale surface hardening to create hardened patterns for improving the wear resistance. This paper is focused on developing analytical thermal model of moving heat sources and integrating it with kinetic hardening model to capture the metallurgical changes induced by fiber lasers. An ideal surface hardening technique should give widest hardened track at minimum case depth. To address this issue, an optimization methodology based on statistical approximation of the physics-based engineering models has been developed."

This new vector was compared to the pPhaT-BP-Luc which harbors the fcpB promoter of P. tricornutum. After P. tricornutum transformation with these vectors, the presence of the exogenous luciferase gene inserted into the genomic DNA of the selected transformants was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. In the transformants, the fcpB promoter was activated dramatically upon 5h of light exposure and its activity was reduced in the dark. However, the expression level of the Luc gene regulated by the EF2 promoter was not significantly affected by light and was higher than that of the Luc gene regulated by the fcpB promoter. Transformants harboring the pEF2::Luc cassette had a high level of luciferase protein expression and constant luciferase activity throughout the light/dark cycle. In addition, the EF2 promoter of P. tricornutum was able to drive the expression of a heterologous gene in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These results indicate that the P. tricornutum EF2 promoter can be used for the expression of target genes in genetically transformed P. tricornutum and C. reinhardtii."

However, this role of social policy, and in particular, the redistributive component of social policy that had underpinned these successful development models, has often gone unrecognized. One of the policy consequences of this neglect has been the proposal of social policy as a remedial action, which just ameliorates the adverse social effects of economic policies that often regressively redistribute wealth and income. Informed by an understanding of social policy which highlights its multiple transformative and developmental roles and functions in production, redistribution, protection, reproduction and social cohesion, this paper argues for a move away from the residualist conceptualization of social policy as a “safety net” and suggests a transformative social policy approach as a core of a new developmental conceptual framework or strategy for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Based on historical and empirical evidence, this paper argues that for the global overarching strategy for the SDGs, a transformative social policy approach can be a better fit than the residual social policy approach, since the former works in tandem with other policies to ensure socially, economically and politically sustainable and equitable development."

transforming growth factor-β receptor 2 gene polymorphisms are associated with end-stage renal disease,2015,['End-stage renal disease Fibrosis Transforming growth factor-beta'],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a multifunctional cytokine involved in immune disorders, cancer, asthma, lung fibrosis, and chronic kidney disease, and its signal pathways are considered crucial mediators of a variety of cellular processes. In addition, several recent studies have reported that TGF-β receptor (TGF-βR) gene polymorphism is associated with chronic kidney disease.However, the association between end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the TGF-β gene polymorphism has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we hypothesized that polymorphisms of the TGF-β ligands or their receptors may be related to ESRD.Methods: We assessed the relationship between four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TGF-βR2 and TGF-β2 genes and ESRD, in 312 patients with ESRD and 258 controls.Results: Compared with the control participants, the frequencies of the TGF-βR2 (rs764522nC) and TGF-βR2 (rs3087465nG) alleles were significantly higher in the patients with ESRD. Genotyping analysis demonstrated that two SNPs in TGF-βR2 of the four SNPs included in the study were significantly associated with ESRD in the codominant 1 [rs764522, odds ratio (OR)¼1.65; rs3087465, OR¼1.63], dominant (rs764522, OR¼1.63; rs3087465, OR¼1.57), and log-additive (rs764522, OR¼1.54; rs3087465, OR¼1.39) models after adjusting for age and sex.Conclusion: We suggest that TGF-βR2 polymorphisms (rs764522 and rs3087465) increase the risk of development of ESRD."

differential transform method and numerical assembly technique for free vibration analysis of the axial-loaded timoshenko multiple-step beam carrying a number of intermediate lumped masses and rotary inertias,2015,"['differential transform method', 'free vibration', 'intermediate lumped mass with/without rotary inertia', 'natural frequency', 'numerical assembly technique', 'Timoshenko multiple-step beam']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Multiple-step beams carrying intermediate lumped masses with/without rotary inertias are widely used in engineering applications, but in the literature for free vibration analysis of such structural systems; Bernoulli-Euler Beam Theory (BEBT) without axial force effect is used. The literature regarding the free vibration analysis of Bernoulli-Euler single-span beams carrying a number of spring-mass systems, Bernoulli-Euler multiple-step and multi-span beams carrying multiple spring-mass systems and multiple point masses are plenty, but that of Timoshenko multiple-step beams carrying intermediate lumped masses and/or rotary inertias with axial force effect is fewer. The purpose of this paper is to utilize Numerical Assembly Technique (NAT) and Differential Transform Method (DTM) to determine the exact natural frequencies and mode shapes of the axial-loaded Timoshenko multiple-step beam carrying a number of intermediate lumped masses and/or rotary inertias. The model allows analyzing the influence of the shear and axial force effects, intermediate lumped masses and rotary inertias on the free vibration analysis of the multiple-step beams by using Timoshenko Beam Theory (TBT). At first, the coefficient matrices for the intermediate lumped mass with rotary inertia, the step change in cross-section, left-end support and right-end support of the multiple-step Timoshenko beam are derived from the analytical solution. After the derivation of the coefficient matrices, NAT is used to establish the overall coefficient matrix for the whole vibrating system. Finally, equating the overall coefficient matrix to zero one determines the natural frequencies of the vibrating system and substituting the corresponding values of integration constants into the related eigenfunctions one determines the associated mode shapes. After the analytical solution, an efficient and easy mathematical technique called DTM is used to solve the differential equations of the motion. The calculated natural frequencies of Timoshenko multiple-step beam carrying intermediate lumped masses and/or rotary inertias for the different values of axial force are given in tables. The first five mode shapes are presented in graphs. The effects of axial force, intermediate lumped masses and rotary inertias on the free vibration analysis of Timoshenko multiple-step beam are investigated."

Both motions of cables and loads acting on cables are expressed with respect to the element frames. Generally, Frenet frame, which is suitable for continuous and differentiable space curves, is widely used for the lumped mass modeling in former researches. The rotational transformation matrix is based on Euler angles of which the rotation angles are carried out by inverse kinematics. However, singularities exist in the combination of the Frenet frame and Euler angles. This paper puts forward a new element frame which is created based on vectors of element orientation and relative velocity. Comparisons with the results by the Frenet frame show this new element frame is stable and overcomes singularities well."

Based on culturally endorsed implicit leadership theory (CLT), we developed and empirically tested a two-by-two matrix model to identify differences in leadership effectiveness depending on the cultural context. Bass (1985) argued that transformational leadership (TFL) is built on a base of transactional leadership (TSL); therefore, a positive moderating effect may exist between these two leadership types. However, House (1996) challenged that argument by insisting that TSL has a negative moderating effect on employee outcome. In this study, we suggest that the moderating effect of TSL may differ depending on the culture. The results of our analysis of four groups classified according to the perceptions of subordinate workers (315 Korean and 181 U.S. employees) of TFL and TSL styles showed highest values for both OC and JS in the high-TFL and high-TSL groups in the Korean sample, while values for the high-TFL and low-TSL groups were highest for U.S. employees. To elucidate these findings further, we investigated the moderating effects of various subdimensions of TFL and TSL. The results indicated that TFL and TSL had positive moderating effects on OC and JS in Korea. However, no such moderating effect was evident in the U.S. sample. These results were consistent with the results of the two-by-two matrix. The findings of this study provide important insight into how managers can lead Korean and U.S. employees more successfully"
masculinity and mission: the transformation of american attitudes towards jews during the “long 1950s”,2015,"['Anti-Semitism', 'Philosemitism', '1950s', 'masculinity', 'Ben-Hur', 'Leon Uris', 'David Ben-Gurion']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The “long 1950s” – roughly 1948 through 1963 – witnessed a significant transformation of Christian attitudes towards Jews in the United States. Among the reasons for the change, perhaps the most surprising was an unprecedented association of Jews with vigorous masculinity at a time of national confusion and anxiety about the meaning and durability of male gender roles. All Americans felt the pull of these tensions, not least among them Protestant Christians who, despite the emergence of new male role models in their own midst, accepted tutelage from other traditions as well. Particularly powerful symbols of the new Jewish masculinity were a triad who can be thought of as the “three Bens”: on the movie screens, Judah Ben-Hur in the 1959 blockbuster film Ben-Hur; from library shelves Ari Ben Canaan, the hero of Leon Uris’s bestselling 1958 novel Exodus as well as the 1960 film made from it; and on the evening news, David Ben-Gurion, whose career as the most important figure in Israeli society and politics coincided exactly with the span of the “long 1950s.” The “three Bens” differed from other male role models in the era by their effective linkage of hyper-masculinity with a sense of focused purpose. The union of masculinity and mission would help shape American ideals and ideologies in the 1960s and beyond."

In an elastic orthogonalfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) super-channel transmission system, demultiplexing a portion ofan entire spectrum in the form of a subband with minimum power is critically required. A major obstacleto achieving this goal is the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which is power-hungry and extremelyexpensive. Without a proper ADC that can work with low power, it is unrealistic to design a 100G coherentreceiver suitable for a commercially deployable optical network. Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is oftenseen as a primary technique for understanding partial demultiplexing, which can be attained either opticallyor electronically. If fairly comparable performance can be achieved with an all-optical DFT circuit, thena solution independent of data rate and modulation format can be obtained. In this paper, we investigatetwo distinct OFDM super-channel receiver models, based on electronic and all-optical DFT-technologies,for partial carrier demultiplexing in a multi-Tb/s transmission system.

The increase in rainfall variability, which covers the increase in the earth’s total precipitation, will definitely lead to frequent and more severe flood disasters. As the damage increases year after year with floods as the most chronic and costly disaster among these hazards, Korea has to improve its technological responses and countermeasures to better visualize the hazards brought about by such disasters. Gunsan City ranked number eight in the country’s most susceptible region to floods. From 2004 to 2013, Korea has experienced a total of 174 flood disasters which were estimated to cost USD 7.32 billion. But reports showed that the total expenditure of the government amounted to 1.4 times the estimated losses and damages and the private companies have spent twice the said estimated amount. To summarize, the post-disaster loss and damage reports showed underestimated values. This study aims to develop a semi-parametric geographically weighted regression which can implement a flood damage estimation model of Gunsan City. The model building process include parameters like flood depth, flood duration, inundated area, family income and land price. The datasets are composed of both untransformed and transformed data (using Box-Cox Method). Both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) were evaluated in this study, but the search for best fit resulted to the use of GWR."

a new query integrity verification method with cluster-based data transformation in cloud computing environment,2015,"['Database outsourcing', 'database transformation technique', 'query result verification method', 'hash-based signature index']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Due to advancement in cloud computing technology, the research on the outsourced database has been spotlighted. In database outsourcing, because the service provider might be untrusted or compromised, two issues of data security emerge: data confidentiality and data integrity. Many data transformation schemes were widely studied for preserving data confidentiality, but they are vulnerable to data leakage problem because they do not consider data distribution when encrypting original data. Meanwhile, several query authentication schemes were proposed to verity data integrity, but they suffer from transmission overhead of verification data. Motivated by these problems, we propose a privacy-aware query authentication scheme which guarantees the data confidentiality and the query result integrity of sensitive data. To solve the original data leakage problem, our clustering-based data transformation scheme is designed to select anchors based on data distribution. To verify the query result, we propose a query result authentication index that stores an encrypted signature for each anchor, which is a concatenated hash digest of cluster data. A user compares the verification information with the cluster signatures stored in the verification index. Through performance evaluation, we show that our method outperforms the existing method in terms of query processing time and verification data size."
metal hybrid nanoparticles for catalytic organic and photochemical transformations,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<title>Conspectus</title><P>In order to understand heterogeneous catalytic reactions, model catalysts such as a single crystalline surface have been widely studied for many decades. However, catalytic systems that actually advance the reactions are three-dimensional and commonly have multiple components including active metal nanoparticles and metal oxide supports. On the other hand, as nanochemistry has rapidly been developed and been applied to various fields, many researchers have begun to discuss the impact of nanochemistry on heterogeneous catalysis. Metal hybrid nanoparticles bearing multiple components are structurally very close to the actual catalysts, and their uniform and controllable morphology is suitable for investigating the relationship between the structure and the catalytic properties in detail.</P><P>In this Account, we introduce four typical structures of metal hybrid nanoparticles that can be used to conduct catalytic organic and photochemical reactions. Metal@silica (or metal oxide) yolk–shell nanoparticles, in which metal cores exist in internal voids surrounded by thin silica (or metal oxide) shells, exhibited extremely high thermal and chemical stability due to the geometrical protection of the silica layers against the metal cores. The morphology of the metal cores and the pore density of the hollow shells were precisely adjusted to optimize the reaction activity and diffusion rates of the reactants. Metal@metal oxide core–shell nanoparticles and inverted structures, where the cores supported the shells serving an active surface, exhibited high activity with no diffusion barriers for the reactants and products. These nanostructures were used as effective catalysts for various organic and gas-phase reactions, including hydrogen transfer, Suzuki coupling, and steam methane reforming.</P><P>In contrast to the yolk– and core–shell structures, an asymmetric arrangement of distinct domains generated acentric dumbbells and tipped rods. A large domain of each component added multiple functions, such as magnetism and light absorption, to the catalytic properties. In particular, metal–semiconductor hybrid nanostructures could behave as effective visible photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and CO oxidation reactions. Resulting from the large surface area and high local concentration of the reactants, a double-shell hollow structure showed reaction activities higher than those of filled nanoparticles. The introduction of plasmonic Au probes into the Pt–CdS double-shell hollow particles facilitated the monitoring of photocatalytic hydrogen generation that occurred on an individual particle surface by single particle measurements.</P><P>Further development of catalysis research using well-defined metal hybrid nanocatalysts with various in situ spectroscopic tools provides a means of maximizing catalytic performances until they are comparable to or better than those of homogeneous catalysts, and this would have possibly useful implications for industrial applications.</P><P><B>Graphic Abstract</B><IMG SRC='http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/achre4/2015/achre4.2015.48.issue-3/ar500411s/production/images/medium/ar-2014-00411s_0010.gif'></P>"

In order to strengthen the non-rigid matching robustness to potential outliers, the optimization model is improved by an iteratively reweighted method. The typical characteristic is to weaken the influence of outliers during iterations. Finally, experiments are carried out to evaluate and analyze the proposed method, including matching accuracy, efficiency and robustness. Shape matching is also an important task in computer vision (such as face registration and object recognition), and the proposed method can find its application in this field."

Understanding environmental processes requires accounting for the flow of matter within and between systems and using atomic-molecular models to describe macroscopic processes. Most students were unable to do this consistently, especially for transformations between gases and solid or liquid substances. Students attributed three characteristics to solids or liquids but not always to gases: a) mass, (students tend to treat gas as nothing and therefore having little or no mass), b) chemical identity, (students tend to refer to gas as air or oxygen no matter what the actual gas is or wherever it comes from), and c) matter-energy distinction, (students tend to consider the conditions or forms of energy as matter rather than as transformation of matter-energy). Students’ abilities to apply fundamental principles depended on the complexity of structures and processes of the systems. It is suggested that science curriculum incorporate environmental systems and processes as the conditions and processes of scientific event, enabling our students to understand matter transformations in both micro- and macroscopic explanations of scientific processes."

prediction of growth habit of β-cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine crystals by the first-principles models,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Experimentally, beta-cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine (beta-HMX) crystals were found to dramatically elongate to the [100] direction when a relatively high supersaturation was imposed. A sudden growth of beta-HMX to the [100] direction is closely associated with a mechanistic transition from spiral growth to two-dimensional (2D) nucleation for the (110) face. The onset supersaturation for the growth by 2D nucleation, sigma(2D), was found to play a key role in the growth of beta-HMX. The present simulation results based on first-principles models such as the spiral growth model and the 2D nucleation model show that the values of sigma(2D) on the (101) and (10 (1) over bar) faces are smaller than those on the (020), (110), and (011) faces. This leads to the prediction of rapid growth rates for the (101) and (10 (1) over bar) faces by 2D nucleation at low supersaturation and the appearance of a typical shape of beta-HMX. On the other hand, the needle-like shape of beta-HMX begins to prevail when the supersaturation exceeds the sigma(2D) for the (110) face because its growth mechanism is transformed from the spiral growth mechanism to the 2D nucleation mechanism which accompanies rapid growth of the (110) face. As a result, the present predictions are in remarkable agreement with the experiments. Furthermore, the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation also shows that the sigma(2D) for the (110) face is lower than that for the (011) face because the (011) face provides the surface topology on which growth units are unfavorably incorporated into the lattice sites. It evidently shows that the relative positions of sigma(2D) bring on the advent of needle-like growth of beta-HMX.</P>"

Serum hyaluronic acid, laminin, procollagen type III, and collagen type IV were examined by using a radioimmunoassay.Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and α-smooth muscle actin(α-SMA) protein in the liver, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) protein in cytoplasm by using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, and MMP-13, TIMP-1, and TGF-β1 mRNA levels in the liver were studied using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.Results: Liver histopathology was significantly better in rats given thalidomide than in the untreated model group. The levels of TIMP-1 and TGF-β1 mRNA and protein expressions were decreased significantly and MMP-13 mRNA and protein in the liver were significantly elevated in the thalidomide-treated group.Conclusion: Thalidomide may exert its effects on the regulation of MMP-13 and TIMP-1 via inhibition of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, which enhances the degradation of extracellular matrix and accelerates the regression of hepatic cirrhosis in rats."
rapid selection of theanine-rich green tea (camellia sinensis l.) trees and metabolites profiling by fourier transform nearinfrared (ft-ir) spectroscopy,2015,"['Tea tree', 'Theanine', 'Amino acids', 'Ninhydrin', 'Colorimetric method', 'FT-IR']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A simple and rapid ninhydrin-based colorimetric method was efficiently developed, and metabolites profiling of tea tree (Camellia sinensis L.) leaf extracts was carried out by Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The tea extracts of Hadong region exhibited a wide range of variations in their theanine contents. In general, theanine and other amino acids were higher in classified theanine-rich lines than that of theanine-poor lines. Among selected theanine-rich lines, the theanine levels reached a maximum of 15.3 mg/g for line TR92, a value 51-fold more than that found in theanine-poor TP23 and TP156 lines. Therefore, ninhydrin-based colorimetric method can be efficiently adopted for the selection of theanine-rich plants thereby enabling selection of plants dependent on their chemical constituents. FT-IR spectroscopy analysis was conducted in 15 tea tree lines as theanine-rich 8 lines and -poor 7 lines. The spectral data were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). PCA and PLS-DA could successfully discriminate theanine-rich and -poor lines. The quantitative prediction modeling of total amino acids and theanine from tea tree leaf lines was established using partial least square regression algorithm from FT-IR spectra. The regression coefficients (R2) between predicted values and estimated values of total amino acids and theanine were 0.976 and 0.992, respectively. These results showed that quantitative predictions of total amino acids and theanine were possible from FT-IR spectra of tea tree leaf lines with higher accuracy. These results suggest that the prediction system established in this study could be applied as a rapid selection of theanine-rich lines of tea tree."

Ten parameters of geomorphological and geological factors wereused as independent variables, and 466 cases (228 non-mobilization cases and 238 mobilization cases) were investigatedfor the statistical analyses. First of all, Fisher’s discriminant function was used for the mobilization criterion. It showed91.6 percent in the accuracy of actual mobilization cases, but homogeneity condition of variance and covariance betweennon-mobilization and mobilization groups was not satisfied, and independent variables did not follow normal distribution,either. Second, binomial logistic analysis was conducted for the mobilization criterion. The result showed 92.3 percentin the accuracy of actual mobilization cases, and all assumptions for the logistic analysis were satisfied.

The predictive model is based on ISO 9613-2 standards using the Noble close proximity (NCPX) method and the pass-by method. This means that the use of these standards is a powerful tool for analyzing the traffic noise level because of the strengths of these methods. Traffic noise analysis was performed based on digital signal processing (DSP) for detecting traffic noise with the pass-by method at the test site.METHODS : There are several analysis methods, which are generally divided into three different types, available to evaluate traffic noise predictive models. The first method uses the classification standard of 12 vehicle types. The second method is based on a standard of four vehicle types. The third method is founded on 5 types of vehicles, which are different from the types used by the second method. This means that the second method not only consolidates 12 vehicle types into only four types, but also that the results of the noise analysis of the total traffic volume are reflected in a comparison analysis of the three types of methods. The constant percent bandwidth (CPB) analysis was used to identify the properties of different frequencies in the frequency analysis. A-weighting was applied to the DSP and to the transformation process from analog to digital signal. The root mean squared error (RMSE) was applied to compare and evaluate the predictive model results of the three analysis methods.RESULTS: The result derived from the third method, based on the classification standard of 5 vehicle types, shows the smallest values of RMSE and max and min error. However, it does not have the reduction properties of a predictive model. To evaluate the predictive model of an ANC system, a reduction analysis of the total sound pressure level (TSPL), dB(A), was conducted. As a result, the analysis based on the third method has the smallest value of RMSE and max error. The effect of traffic noise reduction was the greatest value of the types of analysis in this research.CONCLUSIONS : From the results of the error analysis, the application method for categorizing vehicle types related to the 12-vehicle classification based on previous research is appropriate to the ANC system. However, the performance of a predictive model on an ANC system is up to a value of traffic noise reduction. By the same token, the most appropriate method that influences the maximum reduction effect is found in the third method of traffic analysis. This method has a value of traffic noise reduction of 31.28 dB(A). In conclusion, research for detecting the friction noise between a tire and the road surface for the 12 vehicle types needs to be conducted to authentically demonstrate an ANC system in the Republic of Korea."

The policy implication of thispaper is that Korean port policy planner should introduce the Fuzzy(AIT)DEA, and Cross-efficiency models with the mixed two models when clustering is needed among the Asian ports for enhancing the efficiency of inputs and outputs. Also, the results of SWOT analysis among the clustering ports should be considered."

In this respect, the Korean mobilization system needs a new paradigm which includes military personnel’s responsibility and speciality which lead to make military capacity effectively-utilized and to deploy it suitably in space and on time. From this viewpoint, this paper aims to analyze and discuss the merits and demerits of the conscription system and the volunteer system in connection with the strategy of national security. For this reason, this paper utilizes argumentation model suggested by S. E. Toulmin. As the result, the conscription system which can be kept in near future will be gradually transformed into the volunteer system. In the meantime, salaried military personnel system and co-conscription system should be expanded, which can make some by-products minimal. The transformation into the volunteer system can dissolve youth-unemployment and equalization of both sexes and can consider the future strategy of national security for the Unification. The transform into the volunteer system needs some conditions such as the change of recognition of defence policy, the financial support to military services. However, it is necessary to make it public and discussed because it is a kind of solution against future national strategy."

This paper suggests college English be taught following the principles of the transformed flipped learning-teaching skills. When a teacher utilizes printed learning material in a flipped classroom, there are effects as follows: first, students improve self-directed learning capability; second, there is more interaction between teacher and learner; third, students through learner experience-centered learning process attain deeper comprehension of their material; fourth, students expand their metacognition through feedback with their teacher or fellow students.

In addition, the suggestion of the proper and effective models of leadership in each phases of unification has been made. As for the differentiation of the phases of unification process, three sociological terminologies, as transitions, unification and integration, have been utilized to establish the five stages of various boundariness: the old boundarized stages, the out-of-boundary stage, the early integration stage, the new boundarized stages, and the late integration stage. Continuously, the three paradigms for leadership modeling in terms of those stages of unification are proposed: the situational leadership paradigm which requires the variation or relocate the proper leadership style according to the changes of situation, the transformational leadership paradigm which promotes the macro-scaled innovations and transformations in socio-political contexts, and the neo-charisma paradigm which elicits the positive functions of charisma, and which induces the social changes through the frame transformation between the leaders and the followers. Table 1 summarized the characteristics of situation, goals, influences and communication at each unification stages, and suggested the contextualized models of leadership at each five stages of unification: visionary leadership model, charismatic leadership model, connective leadership model, boundary leadership model, and policy-making leadership model. Additionally, those models of leadership for unification have been translated into the Christian perspectives, as prophetic leadership model, transformational charismatic leadership model, priest leadership model, inter-cultural leadership model, and Christian public leadership model. The focus of this article is by priority more upon the introductory suggestions of the contextualized models of leadership for the general situation of Korean unification, rather than upon the analytic approach to the specific leadership models at the specific situation of unification. The further study is expected from this article for the in-depth research on more detailed modeling of the leadership typology in case of unification as well as that of the Korean unification process and prospects."

Scores of case study are 30 countries among members of world lottery association. The result of case analysis is as followed: as identified by the theoretical contemplation, the lottery businesses of the world transformed from the Prohibit Model to the Alibi Model and to the Risk Model. The Prohibit Model deals with a social problem, such as gambling that proliferated before the establishment of governments during the post-World-War-2 reriod.

Glasser)는 아브라함이 결과적으로 ‘선교의 선구자’가 되었다고 정리한다. 필자는 이스라엘의 족장 아브라 함과 이삭과 야곱은 타문화권 선교사의 롤 모델, 즉 본보기로서 손색이 없다고 본다. 이 글에서 모델이라는 개념은 스코트 모로(A.

Snyder is said to have continuously pursued inductive Bible study reflected in the sentence “We study the Bible not to confirm what we already believe but to find out what it actually teaches, whether that cements or shatters our assumptions,” learned when he was a seminary student. This paper is a piece of the treasure discovered in the author’s continuous journey of inductive Bible study and research in transformative effects. The paper is an extension of the author’s long-lived assertion that the attitude of the missionary is the most important factor in cross-cultural mission. Starting from Genesis 12, God chooses and focuses on one household as a novel and active strategy to bless mankind. From Genesis 12, Abraham and his descendents are nearly the sole subjects of God’s holy history.Arthur F. Glasser proposed that in the end, Abraham became the pioneer in mission. The author further takes this idea and claims that the patriarchs of the Israelite clan, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are excellent role models of cross-cultural mission. In this paper, the concept of “model,” which is classified by A. Scott Moreau as physical, metaphoric, and theoretical, is used in the context of a metaphoric model. The patriarchs are models in the sense that they are aspired by cross-cultural missionaries as a certain ideal. Therefore, an effort is made to extract the examples of being a cross-cultural missionary from the lives of the patriarchs. This is because they are recognized as the model, in other words the standard or the criterion, of cross-cultural missionaries. Through this study, the author finds the theoretical framework of the standards for cross-cultural missionaries: from Abraham, the relationship-succeeding missionary, from Isaac, the well-transferring missionary, from Jacob, the missionary that moved the stone from the mouth of the well. Abraham, who sustained a relationship based on faith and obedience with God and a relationship based on love with the indigenous people, is worthy of being called the pioneer of cross-cultural mission. Isaac, acclaimed for his obedience and concession, is a textbook example of cross-cultural mission in the aspects of transfer and exit strategy. Jacob is also a good model for cross-cultural missionaries in terms of his strategic planning in which the importance of timing, setting goals, and having a phased approach are comprehensively utilized. The author depicts a picture in which cross-cultural missionaries, who must do the work of God while facing many challenges in life, skillfully walk the difficult road paved by the three generations of patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that beautifully embroidered the book of Genesis."

Participants included 126 second grade high school students in four sessions of modeling-based learning regarding continental drift, oceanic ridges, transform faults, and characteristics of faults. A modeling-based learning program was implemented in two classes of the experimental group, and teacher-centered traditional classes were carried out for the other students in the comparison group. Science achievement scores and the distribution of students`` mental models in experimental and comparison groups were quantitatively compared. The video-taped transcripts of five teams’ argumentation were qualitatively analyzed based on the analytic framework developed in the study. The analytic framework for coding students’ argumentation in the modeling-based learning was composed of five components of TAP and the corresponding components containing alternative concepts. The results suggest that the frequencies of causal two-dimensional model and cubic model were high in the experimental group, while the frequencies of simple two-dimensional model and simple cross sectional model were high in the comparison group.

a transportation problem with uncertain costs and random supplies,2015,"['Transportation problem', 'Uncertainty theory', 'Uncertain programming', 'Uncertain random variable']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Transportation problem is an optimization problem. In general, it was studied under random or uncertain condition. Considering the recent complexity, it is not enough to make should be a perfect transportation plan only based on. Usually, there is not only uncertainty but also randomness in many systems. In this paper, the aim is to investigate a transportation problem under uncertain and random environment. As a result, a conceptual uncertain random model is proposed for the problem, where the supplies are considered as random variables, and the costs and the demands are uncertain variables. By minimizing the expected value of uncertain objective function and taking confidence levels on constraints, transforming the model into a crisp mathematical form is the main conclusion. By minimizing the expected value of uncertain objective function and taking confidence levels on constraints, the above model can be turned to a mathematical form. Then transforming the model into a typical mathematical programming model is the main conclusion by using uncertainty theory and probability theory. At the end, a numerical example is given to show the feasibility of the model."

As a result of distinct characteristics of China’s social and historical development, over the years two forms of automotive company have emerged in China: one being Chinese-multinational joint ventures and the other, local automakers that started with their own capital. After China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, China’s automotive sales volume has maintained first place in the world for consecutive years. Over the years of this transformation, China’s automotive market has been influenced by both internal factors such as domestic policies as well as external elements concerned with significant changes of the global automobile industry.  This study aims to provide a deeper insight to the growth of domestically developed SUV models in China. This paper extends the research focus to analyzing the design elements that influence the development of domestic SUV models. With the finding, this paper expects to prospect the potential growth and development of domestically produced SUV models in China (in the future to come).

After examining the ongoing debate regarding the theory of attractive quality, the so-called HWWP (Health, Weapon, Wealth, and Prospect) model to support new product or service design was proposed (2015) which aimed to provide better classification criteria for customer needs and requirements as a first step towards strategic decision support in new product and/ or service design. The purpose of this article is to refine the existing HWWP model as the basis for developing a strategic approach for analysing variations between potential customers‘ needs in order better to understand what qualities should be further cultivated before product launch. The new approach is called “A Greenhouse Approach for Value Cultivation”. Methodology/Approach: Case study data of a new web based customization service for a Romanian shoe manufacturing company is re-analysed to refine the existing HWWP model into the new “Greenhouse Model”, and a generalized regression model with non-linear curves is used for assessing the values of existing service attribute as the basis for further value cultivation. Findings: The -Greenhouse Model” envisages new perspectives of the evaluation of customer needs which better supports strategic decision making regarding further value cultivation for profound affection (= customer delight). Originality/Value of paper: Even if there is a need for further analyses the suggested -Greenhouse Approach for Value Cultivation” is regarded as a new and original contribution to the theory of attractive quality creation which deepens its position in the theory of attractive quality and transforms it into a practical management tool to support new product and service design."

Regression model, as one of the most widely used in statistical tools, so they can utilize various forms of materials in accordance with these requirements, changes to via a different distribution or transformation. This study proposes a regression model using the mixture distribution to fit the proportion data of semi-continuous type, which has a probability mass in a certain discrete values, and estimation method based on maximum quasi-likelihood. Most regression models for the proportion data have used a data transformation, such as a logit transformation, for the response variable and a likelihood estimation based on distribution suitable for the proportion. But it is difficult for these models to apply semi-continuous proportion data, since distributional assumptions are not acceptable. As result, it is likely that the most regression models cannot provide the exact statistical inference. Through the empirical study, the proposed model shows that results for the estimates and fit statistics have no difference with others. Furthermore, it is possible to identify a characteristic with the proposed model, which the other models cannot clarify."

Material properties of the nanobeam are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction according to a novel exponential distribution law in terms of the volume fractions of the metal and ceramic constituents. The upper surface of the functionally graded (FG) nanobeam is pure ceramic whereas the lower surface is pure metal. A nonlocal generalized thermoelasticity theory with dual-phase-lag (DPL) model is used to solve this problem. The theories of coupled thermoelasticity, generalized thermoelasticity with one relaxation time, and without energy dissipation can extracted as limited and special cases of the present model. An analytical technique based on Laplace transform is used to calculate the variation of deflection and temperature. The inverse of Laplace transforms are computed numerically using Fourier expansion techniques. The effects of the phase-lags (PLs), nonlocal parameter and the angular frequency of oscillation of the heat flux on the lateral vibration, the temperature, and the axial displacement of the nanobeam are studied."

Unlike the published work invoking the prismatic beam modeling, the present work proposes a new micro-mechanical approach for analyzing and predicting complicatedly mechanical behaviors of composite structures with initial twisted and curved configurations. At first, the threedimensional heterogeneous elasticity problem is compactly formulated in an intrinsic form which admits initially twisted and curved effects. By taking advantage of smallness of beam-geometric and microstructure-heterogeneous parameters, the variational asymptotic method is then used to split the original three-dimensional problem into a linear three-dimensional micromechanical analysis on the microscopic level and a nonlinear one-dimensional beam analysis on the macroscopic level, respectively. Furthermore, the formulation obtained from the present approach is transformed into a generalized Timoshenko-like beam model as a reasonable compromise between efficiency and accuracy for modeling the initial twisted and curved beams. As the primary validation, a few examples available in the literature are used to demonstrate the capability and accuracy of this new model."

A realistic and accurate fatigue life prediction is quite essential to ensure the safety of engineering design. However, constructing a reliable fatigue life prediction model can be quite challenging. The use of traditional deterministic approach in predicting the fatigue life is sometimes too dangerous in the real practical designs as the method itself contains a wide range of uncertain factors. In this paper, a new fatigue life prediction method is going to be proposed where the residual strength is been utilized. Several cumulative damage models, capable of predicting the fatigue life of a structural element, are considered. Based on Miner's rule, a randomized approach is developed from a deterministic equation. The residual strength is used in a one to one transformation methodology which is used for the derivation of the fatigue life. To arrive at more robust results, fuzzy sets are introduced to model the parameter uncertainties. This leads to a convoluted fuzzy based fatigue life prediction model. The developed model is illustrated in an example analysis. The calculated results are compared with real experimental data. The applicability of this approach for a required reliability level is also discussed."

Compared to the current aspects of each local weddings, South Korea is having strongly side that missed the real meaning of wedding ceremony, due to the western-oriented and commercialism. North Korea is having an overly simplified procedures due to effect of economic conditions and the socialist lifestyle. The case of Korean Chinese living in China, reflecting the historical particularity, shows a complex form that the origin is unclear.  Although the procedure before wedding ceremony has been reduced, but it has been commonly maintained in the three regions because of practical necessity. However, the procedure of wedding ceremony seems to need a unified model.  When Koreans proceed with wedding ceremony, they considered sharing the food for guests as the basis for the wedding feast. The device that can reveal this type the most is right culture of abundant table for feast. These days the culture of abundant table for feast has maintained survived in wedding ceremony of North Korea and Korean Chinese living in China. As the new-style wedding is widespread, the culture of abundant table for feast has disappeared in South Korea.

Now a day’s system can be used for forensic purpose to validate the authenticity of an image. In this paper we present an approach for image forgery authentication. We observe that a non morphed and non forged image shows homogeneity in non spectral domain. This homogeneity is lost when any forgery or morphing is applied on the images. We therefore apply a set of transform over the images. We combine DCT statistics, LBP features with curvelet statistics and Gabor transform of the images to represent an image in the transformed domain. CASIA image dataset with seven thousand authentic and same numbers of tempered images is used to verify the technique. We divide the dataset into equal halves to perform training and testing. Transformed images are used to train Hidden Markov model as HMM can extract probabilistic state information from a large statistical model. A test images is tested in transformed domain by HMM with log likelihood estimator. In case HMM returns an indeterminist result or multiple subset of result, the transformed test image is tested with two class SVM classifier with RBF kernel. Results show that the accuracy of the system is over 89% for 500 test instances."

The writer inspects Abraham’s blessing-story(barak), which is promised and accomplished by God, as the transforming process by which he followed God’s curriculum. The Bible shows that Abraham became a rich, respected powerful leader by God""s blessing. He was also accredited as “a mighty prince” who had God’s authority. Furthermore, the story leads to the change of Abraham""s attitude, until “bowing down before the Hitties""(Gen 23:7,12). Such a transforming story can be regarded as an essential goal of God""s blessing, the humbleness and love to other cultures.  This paper suggests Abraham as a model of spiritual journey for Korean churches and Christians. Christianity is chiefly relationship-based as that the creed of trinity implies the relational love between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Christian mission is to cross barriers to other peoples with love. In another word, Christians must intentionally enlarge their love to other culture nations. Today’s churches and Christians in Korea must focus on the relationship- based spirituality.  Therefore, Abraham can be suggested as the model of a relationally and spiritually grown leader for today’s Christians. The Bible shows that God used “hidden three curriculum,” that is faith-training(love-God), relationship-training(loveneighbors), and intercultural training(love-all-nations). As Abraham""s journey instructs us, today, Korean churches and Christians need to seek to those three training factors for the spiritual growth. Thus, ""intercultural transformation,"" which this writing highly notes, can contribute to the coming multicultural situation in Korea, not only as one of the core of Christian values but also as the basis of faithful spirituality."

smartwatch-based wearable eeg system for driver drowsiness detection,2015,"['support vector machine', 'Driver drowsiness detection', 'EEG', 'wearable devices', 'smartwatch']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Driver drowsiness is a major cause of mortality in traffic accidents worldwide. Many physiological signals have been proposed to detect driver drowsiness. Among these signals, an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal, which reflects the brain activities, is more directly related to drowsiness. Thus, many EEG-based driver drowsiness detection (DDD) models gained more and more attention in recent years. However, one limitation of these studies is that these models merely estimate discrete labels and, thus, did not allow for estimating the relative severity of driver drowsiness. This paper proposes a support vector machine-based posterior probabilistic model (SVMPPM) for DDD, aimed at transforming the drowsiness level to any value of 0~1 instead of discrete labels. A fully wearable EEG system which consists of a Bluetooth-enabled EEG headband and a commercial smartwatch was used to evaluate the proposed model in a real-time way. Twenty subjects who participated in a 1-h monotonous driving simulation experiment were used to develop this model with fifteen subjects for a building model and five subjects for a testing model. According to a video-based reference, the proposed system obtained an accuracy of 91.25% for an alert group (73 out of 80 data sets), 83.78% for an early-warning group (93 out of 111 data sets), and 91.92% for a full-warning group (91 out of 99 data sets). These results indicate that the combination of the proposed SVMPPM, the EEG headband, and the wrist-worn smart device constitutes an effective, simple, and inexpensive wearable solution for DDD.</P>"
region-based object recognition by color segmentation using a simplified pcnn,2015,"['simplified pulse-coupled neural network (SPCNN)', 'Feature-based method', 'image segmentation', 'object recognition', 'region-based matching']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>In this paper, we propose a region-based object recognition (RBOR) method to identify objects from complex real-world scenes. First, the proposed method performs color image segmentation by a simplified pulse-coupled neural network (SPCNN) for the object model image and test image, and then conducts a region-based matching between them. Hence, we name it as RBOR with SPCNN (SPCNN-RBOR). Hereinto, the values of SPCNN parameters are automatically set by our previously proposed method in terms of each object model. In order to reduce various light intensity effects and take advantage of SPCNN high resolution on low intensities for achieving optimized color segmentation, a transformation integrating normalized Red Green Blue (RGB) with opponent color spaces is introduced. A novel image segmentation strategy is suggested to group the pixels firing synchronously throughout all the transformed channels of an image. Based on the segmentation results, a series of adaptive thresholds, which is adjustable according to the specific object model is employed to remove outlier region blobs, form potential clusters, and refine the clusters in test images. The proposed SPCNN-RBOR method overcomes the drawback of feature-based methods that inevitably includes background information into local invariant feature descriptors when keypoints locate near object boundaries. A large number of experiments have proved that the proposed SPCNN-RBOR method is robust for diverse complex variations, even under partial occlusion and highly cluttered environments. In addition, the SPCNN-RBOR method works well in not only identifying textured objects, but also in less-textured ones, which significantly outperforms the current feature-based methods.</P>"
seismic performance of a 10-story rc box-type wall building structure,2015,"['reinforced concrete', 'earthquake simulation test', 'wall', 'slab', 'membrane action']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the seismic performance of high-rise reinforced concrete (RC) box-type wall structures commonly used for most residential buildings in Korea. For this purpose, an analytical model was calibrated with the results of the earthquake simulation tests on a 1:5 scale 10-story distorted model. This calibrated model was then transformed to a true model. The performance of the true model in terms of the stiffness, strength, and damage distribution through inelastic energy dissipation was observed with reference to the earthquake simulation test results. The model showed high overstrength factors ranging from 3 to 4. The existence of slab in this box-type wall system changed the main resistance mode in the wall from bending moment to tension/compression coupled moment through membrane actions, and increased the overall resistance capacity by about 25~35%, in comparison with the common design practice of neglecting the slab's existence. The flexibility of foundation, which is also commonly neglected in the engineering design, contributes to 30~50% of the roof drift in the stiff direction containing many walls.

sustainablity of sustainable fashion products and impact of brand names and cause-related marketing on purchase intention,2015,"['fashion industry', 'fashion product', 'sustainable business practices', 'purchase behavior', 'brand name']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In the fashion industry, designers and researchers have proposed various sustainable fashion products (i.e., sustainability in product development), and retailers have also created many sustainable business practices (i.e., sustainability in distribution). However, according to the previous researches, even though the industry have offered a variety of sustainable designs and retail offers, consumers did not show a positive purchase behavior on the sustainable products. Currently, the gap exists between industry offers for sustainability and consumers’ expectation/acceptance of those offers. This result supports that there are other aspects than environmental protection aspect of the sustainable fashion products that need to be improved and/or be emphasized on to make consumers feel confident in purchasing. To examine consumers’ purchase behavior changes on sustainable fashion products, this study will measure consumers’ equity of sustainability on existing sustainable fashion products with three criteria of sustainable designs proposed by Day and Townsend (1993), which are socially equitable, economically viable, and environmentally benign. Then, consumers’ purchase intention for sustainable fashion products will be measured. The result will show the sustainable fashion product types that currently satisfy consumers so that the industry can concentrate on and develop the types further. In addition, this study will explore the impact of well-known brand names and cause-related marketing whether they would improve consumers’ purchase intention towards sustainable fashion products. No research has studied these two variables for sustainable fashion products as well as the equity of sustainability. Finally, different benefit sought groups will be tested whether they show different acceptance/preference and impact of brand names and cause-related marketing on the sustainable fashion products so that companies can set the appropriate strategies based on their target market’s benefit sought.PROPOSED MODEL AND HYPOTHESESBased on previous researches, the authors propose a new model shown in the figure 1, and the hypotheses are developed based on the model.H1.

H4-5. After adding well-known brand names, the result of the relationship between cause-related marketing and purchase intention in each benefit sought group will be different in all sustainable fashion product types.RESEARCH METHODA simple black dress which is the product silhouette consistently shown through all sustainable fashion product types and relatively low involved when purchasing was selected to minimize the cognitive effort to process/judge the product attributes (Tucker, Rifon, Lee & Reece, 2012). The equity of sustainability is determined as an average score of economic viability, social equity, and environmental responsibility of each sustainable fashion product type. Benefit segments most commonly studied in the previous researches are selected for this study which are price-conscious, fashion-conscious, brand-conscious, convenience-conscious, quality-conscious, self-express, and self-confidence groups. Brand name is a moderator variable to test the brand name effect on participants’ response. Two different versions of questionnaires were distributed. One version shows brand names on the product types, which are selected as reliable brand names from a pretest in terms of quality and credibility, and the other version does not show any brand names on the product types. The reliable brand names are luxury brands such as Ralph Lauren rather than middle to low-priced brands. Both versions include the question for purchase intention before and after cause-related marketing (e.g., “If 10% of this sales is donated to a non-profit organization to preserve our environment, I would buy this item.”). Only female consumers are allowed to participate in the survey because the stimuli are dresses. Surveys were distributed by a commercial survey data collection company. Total 399 surveys were usable (non-brand version, n=190; brand name version, n= 209). The majority of participants are between 25 to 44 years old (22-34 years 49.1%, 35-44 years 16.8%) and has a college degree (college degree 52.6%, graduate school degree 25.8%).RESULTS & CONCLUSIONSFrom the data analysis (see table 1), non-brand companies would have a benefit by offering transformable products in which consumers feel more value than other sustainable fashion product types. When showing luxury brand names, participants evaluated upcycling products as the highest equity of sustainability and purchase intention after cause-related marketing. The zero waste luxury brand product received the highest purchase intention before cause-related marketing and also received a significantly higher equity of sustainability than the non-brand zero waste product. Therefore, it is recommended for luxury brands to show their sustainability practice on the product through labels, especially showing a zero waste production label. The result in all sustainable fashion product types regardless of brand names showed that the higher sustainability, the higher purchase intention. Thus, again, it is important for companies to educate their sustainability practices (e.g., economic, social and environmental values) to consumers through either promotions or labels on the products. For both non-brand and luxury brand products, promoting a donation or support for community/society (i.e., cause-related marketing) on the product would influence consumers' purchase decision when selling the upcycling, recycling and promotion on fashion products. For example, companies could create/include a symbol of their cause-related marketing or include a symbol of a non-profit organization on the sustainable fashion products.Considering different benefit sought groups, the high fashion involved group scored the variables higher in most sustainable fashion product types in the model than the low fashion involved group did. When companies plan to offer sustainable fashion products, they need to target the high fashion involved group for a better sales outcome. Even though participants perceived that the upcycled product was highly sustainable, they purchased different product types. The high fashion involved group highly intended to purchase the transformable product in the non-brand product types and the animal-free product in luxury brand product types in both before and after cause-related marketing. Luxury brands are the ones typically consume most real animal furs and skins, and this might influenced the participants’ purchase intention. The low fashion involved group were willing to purchase the product with organic materials in both non-brand and luxury brands, but cause-related marketing increased the purchase intention on the most of product types. Companies targeting a low fashion conscious group are suggested developing/promoting organic fashion products and actively promote their community/society involvement.Regardless of benefit sought groups, higher equity of sustainability generated higher purchase intention. Again, companies need to inform/promote their sustainability practices to consumers through products or media to improve sales. The impact of cause-related marketing on the purchase intention was significant for the low fashion involved group in the upcycling, recycling, promotion on the product, zero waste and transformable products regardless of brand names. Therefore, when companies cannot appeal consumers with their brand names, the cause-related marketing plays an important role. The low fashion involved consumers seem to consider the after-purchase impact on the society than product itself when purchasing sustainable fashion products. The cause-related marketing had less impact for the high fashion involved group on their purchase intention than the low fashion involved group; however, the purchase intention of non-brand upcycling and the upcycling, recycling and promotion on the product for luxury brands have significantly improved after cause-related marketing. Companies, especially luxury brand names, need to include cause-related marketing when selling those product targeting the high fashion involved group."

The Merkel government pursued the expansionist fiscal policy and welfare expansion rather than neoliberalism and small government. The social policy of the Merkel government to cope with financial crisis does not adopt the welfare retrenchment strategy. The Merkel government succeeded the previous policy packages called ‘Agenda 2010’ made by the Social Democratic Party(SPD) led coalition government and emphasized the importance of job and training. Having Faced with the world financial crisis, the Merkel government criticized the financial capitalism of Anglo-American world and support the ‘Mitte(middle)’ line, putting an great emphasis on the role of social policy and active labor market policy.The social policy of the Merkel government is not simply determined by historical path dependence of German welfare model, but influenced by the dynamic institutional change. The German welfare state is transformed into a hybrid model combined the characteristics of the Anglo-American model and the Scandinavian model. This shows that the social policy of Germany is not determined by economic conditions, but reconstructed through the interrelations of social groups and political processes."

In discussing resilience, it has been revealed that for cities, both determining and achieving resilience are important as targets. The city, a man-made creation, has been the subject of innovation and has developed in connection with human prosperity. However, in facing climate change, cities are confronting a phenomenon that they cannot themselves control. Discussing resilience in the context of existing urban systems is necessary in order to prepare for and to accept problems caused by climate change. In these discussions, it must be considered that cities are vulnerable to climate change, but with their strong governments, can build resilience and implement relevant policies. This study designed a framework to measure and assess urban climate resilience for constructing and implementing urban climate resilience. The first year of this two-year study is now complete. In the first year of study, the main issue was the construction of the framework, indicators, and indices for the measurement of urban climate resilience. Furthermore, the framework, indicators, and indices were considered in concert with a path model for the policy process. First, there are diverse perspectives on resilience: the concept of urban climate resilience has been dealt with in various fields and has been conceived as having various meanings. This study reflects the perspectives of both social evolution and engineering. From the engineering perspective, resilience is the ability to bounce back to a normal state or to equilibrium after disturbances such as natural disasters and social change have destroyed the existing order. From the evolutionary standpoint, resilience refers not to fixed assets but to a process of continuous change. Therefore, it is focused on future rather than present needs; it refers to the socio-ecological ability to adapt to changes and transform systems in response to stress and pressure. Based on these concepts of resilience, this study divided climate change into two groups: rapid events and incremental changes. Rapid events in the short term and incremental changes in the long term were considered to relate to short-term resilience and medium- to longer-term resilience, respectively. Short-term urban climate resilience to rapid phenomena such as extreme and abnormal climate events was contextualized in disaster risk reduction from the engineering perspective. Medium- to longer-term urban climate resilience to incremental climate changes such as rising sea levels and increasing temperatures was considered related to the social evolutionary perspective; from this perspective, alterations to improve urban systems over the long-term must be undertaken. To combine the two concepts of urban climate resilience, the factors involved in making the city resilient against rapid events and incremental changes had to be determined; urban functions were considered key to this process. In this study, urban functions were divided into four types necessary for the city``s maintenance and development: existing, developing, being healthy, and maintaining. These four functions were further subdivided into four sub-functions each: ""existing"" was composed of housing, production, commercial consumption, and employment. ""Developing"" was composed of innovation, social interaction, education, and creativity. ""Being healthy"" was composed of culture and leisure, the environment, health care and welfare, and social safety. ""Maintaining"" was composed of politics and participation, governance, disaster mitigation, and public infrastructure. To measure resilience, the study constructed a framework. This framework distinguishes between short-term resilience and medium- to longer-term resilience; it is complementary to the system of functional indicators and indices. The indices were configured to enable the measurement not only of the performance level of urban functions, but also their capacity for adaptation and transformation. The indicators and indices were obtained based on the advice of experts in related fields of study and a literature review regarding the function and performance of the city. These indicators and indices made it possible to assess the current state of cities from the perspective of short-term resilience or medium- to longer-term resilience. Indicators and indices have been criticized: for example, the interrelation of indicators, indices, and policies has been problematic. Indicators and indices may be formulated for a single framework that is designed to measure a single phenomenon; this hinders the understanding of expected outcomes in regard to the object of measurement. Not only that, but in many cases, the process before the outcome is also omitted from consideration. Therefore, this study used a path model for the policy process that was related to the indicators and indices in order to derive policy intervention activities to ensure urban climate resistance. The path model for the policy process was based on a program theory and logic model and was constructed in consideration of the concept of resilience, the indicators and indices, and the function and performance of the city. Based on the path model, political intervention activities were suggested and prioritized based on expert analysis. Finally, this study determined the form of DB necessary for measuring the indicators and indices, as well as the unit of spatial analysis and methods for application. This will serve as the basis for urban analysis undertaken in the second year of research. In regard to urban climate resilience, a number of limitations and perspectives exist. This study aimed to engage in meaningful, basic research on urban climate resilience to form a basis for research in the second year of this project. The concepts, indicators, indices, and policy model that have been developed in the first year, are to be applied in actual urban analysis. This will strengthen links between urban planning, regional development strategy, and systems for urban climate resilience."
analysis of the jnd-suppression effect in quantization perspective for hevc-based perceptual video coding,2015,"['Perceptual video coding', 'Quantization', 'HEVC']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Transform-domain JND (Just Noticeable Difference)-based for PVC (Perceptual Video Coding) is often performed in quantization processes to effectively remove perceptual redundancy. This study examined the JND-suppression effects on quantized coefficients of transform in HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding). To reveal the JND-suppression effect in quantization, the properties of the floor functions were used for modeling the quantized coefficients, and a JND-adjustment process in an HEVC-compliant PVC scheme was used to tune the JND values by analyzing the JND suppression effect. In the experimental results, the bitrate reduction decreases slightly, but the PSNR and perceptual quality are improved significantly when the proposed JND adjustment process is applied."
structured sparse representation of residue in screen content video coding,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>A novel transform method providing a regionally structured sparse model of residue for a video coding is proposed. Conventional learning-based video coding methods consider only the number of transformed coefficients in a dictionary construction but disregard any structural form of residue. A structural form of coefficients is used for another factor, specified by a set of local block patterns, in a transform design so as to yield the regionally compact distribution of the coefficients. A transform coefficient coding method is also developed because the distribution of the coefficients is different with that of conventional transforms. It is demonstrated with experiments that the proposed method outperforms the coding efficiency and visual quality over high efficiency video coding/screen content coding reference software.</P>"
priestly formation in indian context: a new pedagogy for integral formation of candidates to priesthood in india,2015,"['Integration', 'Internalization', 'Transformation', 'Induction', 'Prophet-mystic', '통합', '내면화', '변화', '귀납', '예언자-신비가.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"“Filii tui India, administri tibi salutis” (Your own sons, O India, will be the heralds of your salvation). These are the words with which Pope Leo XIII, a great visionary and a missionary, established the Papal Seminary for India, Burma and Ceylon in 1890. These prophetic words of Pope Leo XIII, of Rerum Novarum fame have indeed become a reality in the fact today India can boast of 170 dioceses with over 200 bishops and nearly 20,000 priests and over one lakh twenty five thousand religious women and men rendering yeomen service to the people of India. What is also very consoling and encouraging is the fact that for the past two decades a number of Indian priests and religious are serving as missionaries in the continents of Africa, South and Central Americas, Oceania and Europe. Our seminaries and formation houses still attract a fairly good number of young men and women and that too when demographically the families in India are increasingly becoming smaller and nuclear. Although numerically Christians are just 2% of the total population of India (around 25 million in a total population of 125 crores) the service rendered by the Church in India in the field of education, medical and social work is quite significant and laudable, a fact that is often publicly acknowledged and recognized by the Government of India.India today has one of the fastest growing economies of the world and is making tremendous progress in manufacturing industries, information technology, bio technology, nuclear energy, etc. The urbanization and globalization is presently sweeping through the Indian sub-continent with an accelerated speed. This has undoubtedly brought about rapid sociocultural and economic changes in the Indian society. The priestly formation on the other hand still continues on the Tridentine model that is obsolete in many ways and fails to address the challenges and needs of modern India. Hence the need is urgent for a new pedagogy for Integral Formation of candidates to priesthood in India.The need of the hour is to train the candidates to priesthood to become ‘mystics’ in keeping with the ancient and much revered religious tradition of India on the one hand and on the other to be ‘prophets’ in the midst of massive poverty, socio-economic and cultural disparities, dehumanizing injustice and exploitation of all kinds, gender inequality, communal disharmony, etc. Given this context of India, there is definitely a need for a paradigm shift in the pedagogy for the training of candidates to priesthood in India today. The existing priestly formation seems to be very much church centered with over-emphasis on cultic and ritualistic piety, conformism to external rules and regulations, fulfilling the academic requirements of the syllabus. More stress on content and external structures and very little attention to the process of transformation. And therefore it is imperative to evolve a new pedagogy that is integral and holistic in order to equip the candidates, the future leaders of the Church in India with experiential knowledge and skills that could gradually transform their personality as Disciples of Christ, men imbued with deep Christian faith, men of moral and spiritual integrity, men of affective maturity, men who are professionally competent in matters of religion, morality and spirituality. To sum up therefore the goal of Integral formation is to facilitate a process of transformation whereby the candidates become passionate lovers of Christ for compassionate service of God’s people."
거래적 리더십과 변혁적 리더십이 성과측정시스템을 통해 경영성과에 미치는 영향,2015,"['Transactional Leadership', 'Transformational Leadership', 'Use of PMS', 'Business Performance', '거래적 리더십', '변혁적 리더십', 'PMS 이용', '경영성과']","급변하는 경영환경과 치열한 경쟁에 능동적으로 대응하기 위해 기업의 최고경영자나 중간관리자의 리더역할이 어느 때보다도 중요하다. 왜냐하면 리더십은 조직시스템의 생존에 필수적이며, 책임 있고 적절한 리더십은 성공적인 조직비전의 달성에 있어서 결정적인 역할을 하기 때문이다. 최고경영자들은 리더십 스타일(거래적․변혁적 리더십)의 특성대로 PMS(진단PMS․상호작용PMS)를 선택적으로 사용하며 이것은 경영성과(재무성과․비재무성과)에 긍정적인 영향을 미친다.본 연구는 제조기업에 있어서 거래적․변혁적 리더십이 경영성과에 미치는 영향관계를 확인하고, 어떠한 리더십이 경영성과에 긍정적인 영향을 미치는지를 파악하여 기업의 경영성과의 향상을 위하여 나아가야 할 방향을 제시하고자 하였다.주요결과를 보면, 리더십 스타일은 경영성과에 영향을 미치지 않았다. 리더십 스타일과 PMS이용 간에는 거래적 리더십은 PMS이용에 유의한 영향을 미치지만 변혁적 리더십은 상호작용PMS에만 영향을 미치고 진단PMS에는 영향을 미치지 않았다. PMS의 이용과 경영성과 간에는 진단PMS는 재무성과에 영향을 미치지 않았으며, 상호작용PMS는 경영성과에 영향을 미쳤다. 거래적 리더십과 재무성과 간에 PMS이용의 매개효과는 나타나지 않았지만 상호작용PMS이용으로 재무성과가 향상되었다. 변혁적 리더십과 경영성과 간에는 상호작용PMS의 매개효과가 나타났다.","To cope with the rapid business environment and keen competition, a leadership of CEO or senior manager plays an important role in enhancing business performance. Because leadership is essential to the survival of the organization system and responsible and appropriate leadership plays a decisive role in achieving the vision of a successful organization. They use the PMS in a specified way, such as diagnostic and interactive use, and whether the difference in a style of use affects causality of our research model and business performance(financial․non－financial performance).In the main result, leadership styles did not affect the business performance. Between leadership styles and use of PMS, transactional leadership significantly affected the use of PMS, transformational leadership only affected interactive PMS and diagnostic PMS did not affect. The diagnostic PMS did not affect the financial performance and interactive PMS affected business performance.The mediating effect of PMS on relationship between transactional leadership and financial performance were not verified with research models. However, transactional leadership used interactive PMS, and then financial performance was enhanced due to the mediating effect of interactive PMS. The mediating effect of interactive PMS on relationship between transformational leadership and business performance was existed."

First, a technique was examined to detect wet surfaces at nighttime. From the literature reviews, it was revealed that image processing using polarization is one of the preferred options. However, it is hard to use the polarization characteristics of road surface images at nighttime because of irregular or no light situations. In this study, we proposes a new discriminant for detecting wet and dry road surfaces using CCTV image data at night. To detect the road surface conditions with night vision, we applied the wavelet packet transform for analyzing road surface textures. Additionally, to apply the luminance feature of night CCTV images, we set the intensity histogram based on HSI(Hue Saturation Intensity) color model. With a set of 200 images taken from the field, we constructed a detection criteria hyperplane with SVM (Support Vector Machine). We conducted field tests to verify the detection ability of the wet road surfaces and obtained reliable results. The outcome of this study is also expected to be used for monitoring road surfaces to improve safety."

To verify the result from a finite element analysis, a two-dimensional Mo substrate was calculated and its verification experiment was conducted. The absolute values from the finite element analysis of Mo/substrate structure and its verification experiment showed a difference. However, the size of residual stress of individual substrate compositions had a similar tendency. Two-dimensional CIGS/Mo/SiO₂/substrate was modeled. Looking into the residual stress of CIGS layer occurred while the temperature declined from 550℃ to room temperature, the smallest residual stress was found with the use of Fe-52 wt%Ni substrate material."

Three kinds of sliding mode methods were proposed by adopting integral sliding mode, anti-saturation and adaptive method. The stability of each method was proved by constructing Lyapunov method. What is worthy pointing out is that the anti-saturation method can not only reduce the oscillations by using soft function and sigmoid function, but also it can solve the saturation problem of front wheels by using the bounded characteristics of above two functions. And this method is also very simple and it has a reasonable physical meaning which makes the chosen of control parameter very easy. At last, detailed numerical simulations were done for proposed three methods and simulation results were compared with other three methods in the past references to testify the rightness of the proposed method."

the change in us security role prescriptions towards its northeast asian allies at the onset of the post-cold war era,2015,"['National Role Conception', 'Post-Cold War', 'ROK-US Alliance', 'US-Japan Alliance', 'Alliance Transformation', 'Defense Burden Sharing']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper reviews the post-Cold War transformation of the US bilateral alliances in Northeast Asia in the perspective of a national role conception model. By applying role theory to bilateral alliance, this paper analyzes the US redefinition of its bilateral security alliances—the ROK-US alliance and the US-Japan alliance—at the onset of the post-Cold War era. Scrutiny of the US security documents reveals that the US role prescriptions vis-à-vis its alliance partners in Northeast Asia were constituted as a result of close interplay between the external security environment and domestic conditions. Reduced threat perception, budget constraints, and increased demand for a peace dividend forced the US policy makers to undertake a major overhaul of defense policy and posture in Northeast Asia with emphasis on troop reduction and redefinition of security parameters. The US wanted South Korea to play a leading role in defense; the US expected Japan as an equal security partner to step up its security role, centering on the US-Japan alliance. As a result, the US alliance partnership in Northeast Asia has been gradually transformed from “an instrument of balance of power or restraint” into “a power-management (ROK-US) or power-sharing (US-Japan) instrument.”"

Then, particle filter generates filter distribution in the next frame, the moving target is framed by affine transformation. To describe the current state of the target, we calculate posterior probability for each particle. Finally, the templates are updated online. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior in accuracy than the classical tracking algorithm, and it has better robustness against to the target posture changes, partial occlusion and illumination variations."
a new control strategy for a three-phase pwm current-source rectifier in the stationary frame,2015,"['Active damping', 'Controller design', 'Current-source rectifier', 'Proportional resonant', 'Pulse-width modulated', 'Stability']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper presents a novel power control strategy for PWM current-source rectifiers (CSRs) in the stationary frame based on the instantaneous power theory. In the proposed control strategy, a virtual resistance based on the capacitor voltage feedback is used to realize the active damping. In addition, the proportional resonant (PR) controller under the two-phase stationary coordinate is designed to track the ac reference current and to avoid the strong coupling brought about by the coordinate transformation. The limitations on improving steady-state performance of the PR controller is investigated and mitigated using a cascaded lead-lag compensator. In the z-domain, a straightforward procedure is developed to analyze and design the control-loop with the help of MATLAB/SISO software tools. In addition, robustness against parameter variations is analyzed. Finally, simulation and experimental results verify the proposed control scheme and design method."

the change in us security role presriptions towards its northeast asian allies at the onset of the post-cold war era,2015,"['National Role Conception', 'Post-Cold War', 'ROK-US Alliance', 'US-Japan Alliance', 'Alliance Transformation', 'Defense Burden Sharing']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper reviews the post-Cold War transformation of the US bilateral alliances in Northeast Asia in the perspective of a national role conception model. By applying role theory to bilateral alliance, this paper analyzes the US redefinition of its bilateral security alliances-the ROK-US alliance and the US-Japan alliance-at the onset of the post-Cold War era. Scrutiny of the US security documents reveals that the US role prescriptions vis-a-vis its alliance partners in Northeast Asia were constituted as a result of close interplay between the external security environment and domestic conditions. Reduced threat perception, budget constraints, and increased demand for a peace dividend forced the US policy makers to undertake a major overhaul of defense policy and posture in Northeast Asia with emphasis on troop reduction and redefinition of security parameters. The US wanted South Korea to play a leading role in defense; the US expected Japan as an equal security partner to step up its security role, centering on the US-Japan alliance. As a result, the US alliance partnership in Northeast Asia has been gradually transformed from ""an instrument of balance of power or restraint"" into ""a power-management (ROK-US) or power-sharing (US-Japan) instrument."""

The model is composed of three factors：inputs (R&D budgets and researchers), outputs (patents and papers), and outcomes (technical fees, products sales, and cost savings). Three stages are defined for each transformation process between the three factors：efficiency stage from input to output (stage 1), effectiveness stage from output to outcome (stage 2), and productivity stage from input to outcome (stage 3). The performance of each stage is measured by data envelopment analysis (DEA). DEA is a non-parametric efficiency measurement technique that has widely been used in R&D performance measurement. We measure the performance of 171 projects of 6 public R&BD programs managed by Seoul Business Agency using the proposed three-stage model. In order to provide a balanced and holistic view of R&BD performance, the R&BD performance map is also constructed based on performance of efficiency and productivity stages."
a weighted bio-signal denoising approach using empirical mode decomposition,2015,"['Empirical mode decomposition', 'Discrete wavelet transform thresholding', 'Least squares constrained coefficients', 'ECG', 'EEG', 'Signal denoising']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to show the effectiveness of a physiological signal denoising approach called EMDDWT- CLS.Methods This paper presents a new approach for signal denoising based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), discrete wavelet transform (DWT) thresholding, and constrained least squares (CLS). In particular, the noisy signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to obtain intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) plus a residue. Then, each IMF is denoised by using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) thresholding technique. Finally, the denoised signal is recovered by performing a weighted summation of the denoised IMFs except the residue. The weights are determined by estimating a constrained least squares coefficients; where, the sum of the coefficients is constrained to unity. We used human ECG and EEG signals, and also two EEG signals from left and right cortex of two healthy adult rats.Results The 36 experimental results show that the proposed EMD-DWT-CLS provides higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and lower mean of squared errors (MSE) than the classical EMD-DWT model.Conclusions Based on comparison with classical EMDDWT model used in the literature, the proposed approach was found to be effective in human and animal physiological signals denoising."

Furthermore, this research focuses on explaining foreign aid utilization and its contribution to the economic development of Korea in terms of the role of government ownership and commitment. The author also compares the circumstances of Korea’s past economy with Laos’ current economy through in-depth study of the political regime and socioeconomic circumstances in Laos, and derives similarities between the two. Laos is a country now standing at a crossroads: it has achieved robust economic growth in recent years, but still remains dependent on foreign aid for its government budget, trade, and investment. Korea’s management and governance of foreign aid, and its emphasis on socioeconomic capabilities and infrastructure and human resources development, can provide a model for aid governance in Laos, helping the Lao government cohere diverse objectives and gather scattered efforts into a single control tower."
study on curing behaviors of epoxy acrylates by uv with and without aromatic component,2015,"['epoxy acrylate', 'UV curing', 'cure kinetics', 'autocatalysis', 'time-temperature-transformation diagram']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Two kinds of epoxy acrylates, aromatic BAGEDA (bisphenol A diglycidyl ether diacrylate) and aliphatic BDGEDA (1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether diacrylate), were prepared from BADGE (bisphenol A diglycidyl ether) and BDDGE (1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether) respectively by reacting with acrylic acid. Synthesis and change in functional groups were confirmed by FTIR spectra. In the studies of UV curing behaviors by Photo-DSC (differential photocalorimetry), rate constants and conversions under isothermal conditions (Tcure=30-80 oC) were determined by exothermic heat flows. Thus, maximum reaction rates of BAGEDA and BDGEDA were 4.06×10-2 s-1 and 5.01×10-2 s-1 respectively. UV curing behaviors were confirmed to follow Kamal equation model. Activation energies were 23.5 kJ/mol (Ea1) and 12.0 kJ/mol (Ea2) for BAGEDA, and 25.0 kJ/mol (Ea1) and 11.3 kJ/mol (Ea2) for BDGEDA. In the UV curing reaction of BAGEDA, the maximum reaction rate constants and conversions were increased by increasing reaction temperatures (Tcure), while in that of BDGEDA those were increased until 60 oC followed by a gradual decrease above 60 oC. These phenomena were understood by Gillham’s time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram in which curing behavior was determined by the glass transition temperature (Tg) of cured material at each reaction temperature."

By adding a robust factor and modifying the  covariance matrix in real time, it enhanced the stability for detecting distorted signals.  The proposed tracking algorithm can effectively solve the problems of traditional  Extended Kalman Filter such as lack of adaptability, instability and divergence.

The causes of SSB are originated from tracking, selection, and height assignment error, which is known to be the leading error. However, recent works have shown that height assignment error cannot be fully explained the cause of SSB. This paper attempts a new approach to examine the possibility of SSB reduction of COMS AMV by using a new target tracking algorithm. Tracking error can be caused by averaging of various wind patterns within a target and changing of cloud shape in searching process over time. To overcome this problem, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) has been adopted to extract the coldest cluster as target since the shape of such target is less subject to transformation. Then, an image filtering scheme is applied to weigh more on the selected coldest pixels than the other, which makes it easy to track the target. When AMV derived from our algorithm with sum of squared distance method and current COMS are compared with rawindsonde, our products show noticeable improvement over COMS products in mean wind speed by an increase of 2.7 ms_1 and SSB reduction by 29%. However, the statistics regarding the bias show negative impact for mid/low level with our algorithm, and the number of vectors are reduced by 40% relative to COMS. Therefore, further study is required to improve accuracy for mid/low level winds and increase the number of AMV vectors."

It was also a time of re-birth of Korea as a modern state, at the domestic level. As a Confucianist, Kim Yunsik adopted a reform model, that of the late Qing dynasty’s Self-Strengthening Movement (洋務運動), by which Kim pursued Chos?n’s wealth and power with the idea of prolonging the traditional dynastic state and the Confucian state political system. His foreign policy in relation to China, during the same period, was based on the concept of “vassal but autonomous state” (屬邦自主). Kim tried to improve Chos?n’s statesecurity by utilizing the traditional tributary relationship with China. His strategy represented Chos?n’s typical stance which gave top priority to its diplomatic relations with China, the sole superpower in East Asia. However, the defeat of China in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 made Chos?n’s ruling elites deliberate on the autonomy of Korea not from China but as a modern sovereign nation. Even the Confucianists came to recognize that true autonomy was possible only with political independence and sovereignty. At the same time, the concept of sovereignty opened the way for constitutionalism in that it allowed for political legitimacy not in the investiture system but as a sovereign state. To sum up, the transformation from the traditional Confucian state to the modern sovereign state was an essential prerequisite for Choso˘n’s survival and prosperity in the modern era, and the Gabo Reform, although a failed attempt, provided a chance for such transformation."

The dependent variables such as burnout ratios (BOR) of coal and CO/CO2 ratios were mathematically described as a function of three independent variables (coal particle size, carrier gas flow rate, wall temperature) being modeled by the use of the central composite design (CCD), and evaluated using a second-order polynomial multiple regression model. The prediction of BOR showed a high coefficient of determination (R2) value, thus ensuring a satisfactory adjustment of the second-order polynomial multiple regression model with the simulation data. However, CO/CO2ratio had a big difference between calculated values and predicted values using conventional RSM, which might be mainly due to the dependent variable increses or decrease very steeply, and hence the second order polynomial cannot follow the rates. To relax the increasing rate of dependent variable, CO/CO2 ratio was taken as common logarithms and worked again with RSM. The application of logarithms in the transformation of dependent variables showed that the accuracy was highly enhanced and predicted the simulation data well."

Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) signaling plays a key role in the fibrotic response to chronic liver injury. To develop anti-fibrotic therapeutics, we synthesized a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the TGF-β type I receptor kinase (ALK5), EW-7197, and evaluated its therapeutic potential in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) mouse, bile duct ligation (BDL) rat, bleomycin (BLM) mouse, and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse models. Western blot, immunofluorescence, siRNA, and ChIP analysis were carried out to characterize EW-7197 as a TGF-β/Smad signaling inhibitor in LX-2, Hepa1c1c7, NRK52E, and MRC5 cells. In vivo anti-fibrotic activities of EW-7197 were examined by microarray, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and a survival study in the animal models. EW-7197 decreased the expression of collagen, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin, 4-hydroxy-2, 3-nonenal, and integrins in the livers of CCl4 mice and BDL rats, in the lungs of BLM mice, and in the kidneys of UUO mice. Furthermore, EW-7197 extended the lifespan of CCl4 mice, BDL rats, and BLM mice. EW-7197 blocked the TGF-β1-stimulated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), collagen, and α-SMA in LX-2 cells and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) isolated from mice. Moreover, EW-7197 attenuated TGF-β- and ROS-induced HSCs activation to myofibroblasts as well as extracellular matrix accumulation.

In fact, there has been conflict over the medical jurisdiction between western and oriental medical doctors since the Independence. While the western medical doctors has tried to maintain monopolistic control over the medicine since the Independence, it was not that much successful due to the fact that the oriental medical doctor were successfully managing the entrance of official medical jurisdiction and expanding their practices. That means western doctors were failing to establish the unified health care system. If so, it might be interesting to ask of how the oriental medical doctors have expanded their jurisdiction over the health care system and become a medical professional.The historical change of occupational works shows some aspects of professional establishment by the oriental medical doctor. Mode of medical practice, perception by the people, historical operation by oriental medical doctors and the change in the contents of medical practice in a broader sense are among those. In other words, the process of the emergence of oriental medical profession might be explained from the perspective of the combined interaction of collective action and surrounding social circumstances. The intention of the paper is to display the process of how the traditional oriental medical occupation is experiencing its transformation into the professional. For the purpose, the jurisdictional conflicts in the areas of institution, public opinion and practice are analyzed since the Independence by utilizing the professional system model."

the paradoxes in globalization’s economic empowerment of south korea,2015,"['development state', 'economic development', 'globalization', 'neoliberalism', 'South Korea', 'jaebeol']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"From a broad perspective, South Korea’s “Miracle on the Han River” appears quite miraculous. Economically, South Korea was transformed from one of the poorest nations in the world at the end of the Korean War to a developed nation in the early twenty-first century. The growing globalization of the world economy clearly empowered South Korea as growing integration into the world economy was the centerpiece of the nation’s economic developmental strategy. Yet, Korea’s rapid growth and industrial transformation appear paradoxical in several key regards. First, an economic miracle should produce a satisfied and grateful population, but most leading politicians and the country’s leading economic and political institutions have been fairly unpopular during most of South Korea’s postwar history. Second, the South Korean experience crosscuts the normal debate in development studies, which conflates globalization and neoliberalism. Third, South Korea’s widely vaunted developmental state in the 1960s and 1970s in reality departed quite significantly from the developmental state model. Finally, South Korea’s attempts to promote its integration into the global economy during the post-developmental state period produced several sets of contradictory effects."

new chosen-ciphertext secure identity-based encryption with tight security reduction to the bilinear diffie-hellman problem,2015,"['Identity-based encryption', 'Tight security reduction', 'Chosen-ciphertext security', 'Bilinear map']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We propose a new identity-based encryption (IBE) system that achieves a tight security reduction to the bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) problem in the random oracle model. Tightness indicates that some level of IBE system security can be straightforwardly based on the hardness of the BDH problem at the same security level. Achieving such tightness requires two strategies: (1) a key generation technique for all identities, and (2) a searching method for the solution to the BDH problem. To implement the first strategy, our system relies on a key generation paradigm recently introduced with the Park-Lee IBE system. To implement the second strategy, we base our system on the strong twin BDH problem that includes access to a decision oracle. We compare the efficiency of our system with that of the previous Nishioka IBE system (based on the Katz-Wang key generation paradigm) combined with another tight variant of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform."

However, there are noticeable differences between the EU and Japan in their ETS. Whereas Japan has focused on securing certifications in CDM as the implementation of Kyoto protocol, EU has shown a tendency to transform the trading market from a parallel structure of EUA and CER transaction to only the EUA transaction after ending of 1st commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Since the differences were mainly caused by not only in a design of the system but also in internal governance and their national circumstance, it is meaningful to analyse the Korean case with a similar framework. This study may contribute to designing an appropriate system for emission trading in Korea through the comparison of the EU and Japanese case."

The NFS represents a multivariate nonlinear function of state variables, which can indicate useful information of a target system for control. The optimal nonlinear estimator of an NFS (in mean square sense) represents a function of the receding horizon estimate and its error covariance. The proposed receding horizon filter represents the standard Kalman filter with time-delays and special initial horizon conditions described by the Lyapunov-like equations. In general case to calculate an optimal estimator of an NFS we propose using the unscented transformation. Important class of polynomial NFS is considered in detail. In the case of polynomial NFS an optimal estimator has a closed-form computational procedure. The subsequent application of the proposed receding horizon filter and nonlinear estimator to a linear stochastic system with time-delays and uncertainties demonstrates their effectiveness.</P>"

This research, however, attempts to catch up with practice for a long term goal of e-HRM adoption and its role on strategic HRM and organizational performance. To address this issue, this study examines the relationship of various elements of e-HRM acceptance (i.e., facilitating conditions, clarity of e-HRM goals, job relevance, ease of use, service quality, and HR professional improvement) on establishing an effective strategic HRM and the organizational performance. Using the survey data collected among employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Lao PDR, the study tests a mediation model employing structural equation modeling. Results suggest that clarity of e-HRM goals, HR professional improvement, and the perceived ease of use of e-HRM are important predictors of strategic HRM. The mediation analysis also suggests that strategic HRM partially mediates the relationship of facilitating conditions and organizational performance, while fully mediating on the association between clarity of goals, HR professional improvement and organizational performance. Finally, the article points out the study``s theoretical, empirical, and practical implications and directions for future research."

The rat colitis modelwas induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid(TNBS). Baicalin (10 ml/kg, each) or mesalazine (positivecontrol) was then administered orally for 7 days. Inflammatoryand immunological responses were evaluated bypathology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, real-timepolymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, and flowcytometry. Our study showed that baicalin not only significantlyattenuated TNBS-induced colitis by reducing thedisease activity index as well as macroscopic and microscopicscores, but it also improved the weight loss andshortening of the colon. Baicalin treatment also induced asignificant decrease in the levels of inflammatory mediators,including the myeloperoxidase activity, the levels oftumor necrosis factor a, IL-1b, and Th1-related cytokinesIL-12 and IFN-c. Furthermore, the beneficial effects ofbaicalin seem to be associated with regulation of the Th17and Treg paradigm. We found that administration ofbaicalin significantly downregulated the number of Th17cells and the levels of Th17-related cytokines (IL-17 andIL-6) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor ct.In contrast, there was an increase in Treg cells numbers,Treg-related cytokines transforming growth factor-b andIL-10, and forkhead box P3. Our results suggest that theanti-inflammatory effect of baicalin may be linked tomodulation of the balance between Th17 and Treg cells inTNBS-induced ulcerative colitis."

In this study, we investigated the effects of acetic acid on endurance capacity and muscle oxidative metabolism in the exercise training using in vivo mice model. In exercised mice, acetic acid induced a significant increase in endurance capacity accompanying a reduction in visceral adipose depots. Serum levels of non-esterified fatty acid and urea nitrogen were significantly lower in acetic acid-fed mice in the exercised mice. Importantly, in the mice, acetic acid significantly increased the muscle expression of key enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation and glycolytic-to-oxidative fiber-type transformation. Taken together, these findings suggest that acetic acid improves endurance exercise capacity by promoting muscle oxidative properties, in part through the AMPK-mediated fatty acid oxidation and provide an important basis for the application of acetic acid as a major component of novel ergogenic aids.</P>"

North Korea’s motive for possessing nuclear weapons is closer to a security model’s, and its negotiation means is more direct and provocative. The economic factor has no specific effect in the North Korean nuclear negotiations due to the characteristic of the North’s economic system, the selective sanctions of the international community, and the passive attitude of China. Also, due to the rise of China and the fact of North Korea-China relations, the United States faces difficulties in considering the North Korean issues together with the Chinese variables in the negotiations. To resolve the North Korean nuclear negotiations in the future, the interests of countries participating in the six-party talks needs to be considered to increase negotiating pressure on the North. In addition, judging from North Korea’s economic system and economic policies, the economic incentives and sanctions must be appropriately employed and means to increase effectiveness devised. Also, changes in North Korea-U.S. relations must put South Korea at the center and be aimed at transforming North Korea. Finally, changes in North Korea since the suspension of the six-party talks must be taken into account, and the negotiation strategy toward North Korea must be readdressed."
the effects of electrode configuration on body channel communication based on analysis of vertical and horizontal electric dipoles,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The effects of electrode configuration on body channel communication (BCC) are studied for the development of body channel characteristics, such as frequency response, path loss, and resilience to other interferers. First, this paper introduces nine types of electrode configurations according to the arrangement and direction of both transmitting and receiving electrodes on the body. Each configuration is then modeled by means of vertical and horizontal electric dipoles. From Maxwell's equations, the complete equations of vertical and horizontal electric fields on the human body, followed by the ratios of the received electric field to the transmitted electric field, are obtained to find the theoretical body channel characteristics and the effect of electrode configurations on the body channel. The theory is verified with measurement results using a network analyzer and balun transformer. In addition to the channel characteristics, the influence of BCC and RF interference on the body channel is investigated and discussed along with receiving electrode configurations. Based on the measurement results, we found that vertical electrodes in the transmitter and horizontal electrodes with longitudinal direction in the receiver is the optimal configuration for BCC in regard to transmission gain, environmental sensitivity, and interference resilience. Finally, we suggest an effective parameter for BCC, which is equivalent reference distance to determine the proper electrode size for the required frequency response. The relation between the parameter and the electrode size is formulated for the purpose of proper electrode utilization in the design of BCC systems as well as in many potential applications.</P>"

Supporting distortion-free is a very important factor in time-series matching to get more accurate matching results. In this paper, we visualize the result of time-series matching, which removes various time-series distortions such as noise, offset translation, amplitude scaling, and linear trend by using moving average, normalization, linear detrending transformations, respectively. The proposed visualization tool works as a client-server model. The client sends a user-selected time-series, of which distortions are removed, to the server and visualizes the matching results. The server efficiently performs the distortion-free time-series matching on the multi-dimensional R*-tree index. By visualizing the matching result as five different charts, we can more easily and more intuitively understand the matching result."
placental growth factor-1 and -2 induce hyperplasia and invasiveness of primary rheumatoid synoviocytes,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Inflammation-mediated oncogenesis has been implicated in a variety of cancer types. Rheumatoid synovial tissues can be viewed as a tumor-like mass, consisting of hyperplastic fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). FLSs of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have promigratory and invasive characteristics, which may be caused by chronic exposure to genotoxic stimuli, including hypoxia and growth factors. We tested whether a transformed phenotype of RA-FLSs is associated with placental growth factor (PlGF), a representative angiogenic growth factor induced by hypoxia. In this study, we identified <I>PlGF-1</I> and <I>PlGF-2</I> as the major <I>PlGF</I> isoforms in RA-FLSs. Global gene expression profiling revealed that cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cell migration were mainly represented by differentially expressed genes in RA-FLSs transfected with small interfering RNA for <I>PlGF</I>. Indeed, <I>PlGF</I>-deficient RA-FLSs showed a decrease in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, but an increase in apoptotic death in vitro. <I>PlGF</I> gene overexpression resulted in the opposite effects. Moreover, exogeneous PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 increased survival, migration, and invasiveness of RA-FLSs by binding their receptors, Flt-1 and neuropilin-1, and upregulating the expression of antiapoptotic molecules, pErk and Bcl2. Knockdown of <I>PlGF</I> transcripts reduced RA-FLS proliferation in a xenotransplantation model. Collectively, in addition to their role for neovascularization, PlGF-1 and -2 promote proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion of RA-FLSs in an autocrine and paracrine manner. These results demonstrated how primary cells of mesenchymal origin acquired an aggressive and transformed phenotype. PlGF and its receptors thus offer new targets for anti-FLS therapy.</P>"

The properties of viscoelastic materials present strong non-linear characteristics in the time, temperature andfrequency domains. The objective is to explore the possibility of having a rational understanding of the complex response. The neuralnetwork technique is thus implemented for this purpose. This study presents the differential constitutive equations of viscoelastic materialsbased on the generalized Kelvin model. The viscoelastic response Laplace transform equations of the sleeve structure are derivedunder the condition of plane strain according to the boundary conditions of the viscoelastic sleeve. The orthogonal design test results ofviscoelastic numerical calculations are normalized and trained using a three-layer BP neural network. The trained network can easilyrealize the mapping of the viscoelastic material test set. Simulation results show that the neural network test and numerical solution resultsare close to each other, and the maximum error of all variables is less than 2.8 percent. The results obtained in this research revealthat the neural network technique has a suitable capability in establishing correlations among different loads and corresponding viscoelasticresponses. The developed neural network model can effectively solve the non-linear problems of viscoelastic structures."
amelioration of auditory response by da9801 in diabetic mouse,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease that involves disorders such as diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic hearing loss. Recently, neurotrophin has become a treatment target that has shown to be an attractive alternative in recovering auditory function altered by DM. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of DA9801, a mixture of <I>Dioscorea nipponica</I> and <I>Dioscorea japonica</I> extracts, in the auditory function damage produced in a STZ-induced diabetic model and to provide evidence of the mechanisms involved in enhancing these protective effects. We found a potential application of DA9801 on hearing impairment in the STZ-induced diabetic model, demonstrated by reducing the deterioration produced by DM in ABR threshold in response to clicks and normalizing wave I–IV latencies and Pa latencies in AMLR. We also show evidence that these effects might be elicited by inducing NGF related through Nr3c1 and Akt. Therefore, this result suggests that the neuroprotective effects of DA9801 on the auditory damage produced by DM may be affected by NGF increase resulting from Nr3c1 via Akt transformation.</P>"

The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and von Karman nonlinear strain theory are used together to derive the equations of motion. After the equations of motion are transformed into the weak forms, the weak forms are discretized. The natural frequency and dynamic response are obtained.

"is the dust cloud around lambda orionis a ring or a shell, or both?",2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The dust cloud around. Orionis is observed to be circularly symmetric with a large angular extent (approximate to 8 degrees). However, whether the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the cloud is shell-or ring-like has not yet been fully resolved. We study the 3D structure using a new approach that combines a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer model for ultraviolet (UV) scattered light and an inverse Abel transform, which gives a detailed 3D radial density profile from a two-dimensional column density map of a spherically symmetric cloud. By comparing the radiative transfer models for a spherical shell cloud and that for a ring cloud, we find that only the shell model can reproduce the radial profile of the scattered UV light, observed using the S2/68 UV observation, suggesting a dust shell structure. However, the inverse Abel transform applied to the column density data from the Pan-STARRS1 dust reddening map results in negative values at a certain radius range of the density profile, indicating the existence of additional, non-spherical clouds near the nebular boundary. The additional cloud component is assumed to be of toroidal ring shape; we subtracted from the column density to obtain a positive, radial density profile using the inverse Abel transform. The resulting density structure, composed of a toroidal ring and a spherical shell, is also found to give a good fit to the UV scattered light profile. We therefore conclude that the cloud around lambda Ori is composed of both ring and shell structures.</P>"

identifying and evaluating chaotic behavior in hydro-meteorological processes,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>The aim of this study is to identify and evaluate chaotic behavior in hydro-meteorological processes. This study poses the two hypotheses to identify chaotic behavior of the processes. First, assume that the input data is the significant factor to provide chaotic characteristics to output data. Second, assume that the system itself is the significant factor to provide chaotic characteristics to output data. For solving this issue, hydro-meteorological time series such as precipitation, air temperature, discharge, and storage volume were collected in the Great Salt Lake and Bear River Basin, USA. The time series in the period of approximately one year were extracted from the original series using the wavelet transform. The generated time series from summation of sine functions were fitted to each series and used for investigating the hypotheses. Then artificial neural networks had been built for modeling the reservoir system and the correlation dimension was analyzed for the evaluation of chaotic behavior between inputs and outputs. From the results, we found that the chaotic characteristic of the storage volume which is output is likely a byproduct of the chaotic behavior of the reservoir system itself rather than that of the input data.</P>"

The present study aims to screen the bacterial strains isolated from soils and polluted pond for their potential biosorption of both cationic dye and cadmium. Bacillus catenulatus JB-022 strain removed 58% and 66% of cationic basic blue 3 (BB3) and cadmium (Cd(II)) at the respective concentrations of 2000 mg/L and 150 mg/L. The biosorption equilibrium data were well fitted by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the kinetic studies indicated that the biosorption followed the pseudo-second-order model. The biosorption kinetics showed that the equilibrium was reached within 10 min and 5 min for BB3 and Cd(II), respectively. According to the Langmuir model, the maximum uptakes of BB3 and Cd(II) by the JB-022 biomass were estimated to be 139.74 and 64.28 mg/g, respectively. To confirm the surface morphology and functional groups, field emission scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses were carried out, and the results revealed that the biomass of JB-022 has carboxyl and phosphonate groups as potential surface functional groups capable of binding to cationic pollutants.

In Korea, falling real estate prices has meant many construction companies going bankrupt because of the vast number of unsold apartments. To alleviate this problem, construction companies have begun to provide potential apartment buyers with free options such as the withdrawal guarantee option, principal guarantee option, premium guarantee option, and buy-back option. In this study, we attempt to analyze the real value and the market risk of these options which has no market value yet. To price the options, we used GARCH option pricing model and Esscher transform. As the result, the price of the withdrawal guarantee option was significantly higher than the other options, and this fact implies that this option may be attractive to the investor in terms of marketing, while the construction firms as issuer may pay the costs. In addition, we applied the DD(Default to Distance) of two companies and VaR of the options in order to manage the risk caused by the options. As the result, according to the analysis of the DD, the issue of the options seems to be helpful to the company immediately. According to the VaR analysis, the principal guarantee option is the most risky option among the options by falling the value of the asset and the value of the option in depressing markets."

A delayed introduction of this post to the Korean public producing theatre in the late 1990s was accompanied by scant understanding of the post itself as well as its leadership responsibility. As it was repeatedly evidenced in the preceding governance structures of the NTOK(National Theatre of Korea), the former umbrella organization of the NTCK(National Theatre Company of Korea), the position itself underwent a series of odd transformation. From the first combined title of the Company Head cum Artistic Director to the duel leadership of the two positions in parallel, and finally to the latter``s sole leadership in the 2000s, this position appeared to have been destined to change forever its professional identity. Throughout this long transitional years, Artistic Director``s leadership responsibility was largely limited to the selection of programmes and the season planning. Later when the NTCK became an independent organization in 2010, general perception for this position was ameliorated, allowing for the Artistic Director to take in full charge of his/her rightful leadership of the whole institution, including the administrative aspects. Yet little or no discerning attempt has been, on the part of the concerned Ministry of Culture or any public agency, made so far to clarify this post by specifying the Artistic Director``s professional identity, function, and the overall leadership responsibility. This has been one of the essential causes for those incessant controversies over the appointment of the Artistic Director in the Koran public performing arts institutions in recent years. Pondering on such a background, this paper is intended to explore the state and condition of the Artistic Directorship in the Korean public producing theatre institution as represented by the NTCK, and to suggest an alternative scheme for improvement. Along with the historical and conceptual consideration of the Artistic Directorship in the beginning chapters, those practices of the representative state institutions, the NT, England and the NTCK as either an international instance or the Korean model, are speculated in parallel for both comparison and contrast in the main body of the paper. With the indication of the problems, suggestions in the form of a proposal are, in place of the conclusion, made for practical application."

As the thermal exposure time is increased, a proportional increase until 36 weeks in tensile strength is observed, while an increasing tendency in impact strength at the early stage of thermal degradation and then a drastic decrease after 27 weeks are shown. These results can be explained by the increases of chain entanglement and crystallinity at the early stage, followed by the increase of crosslinking density, chain scission and the decrease in chain mobility at the late stage of degradation, due to thermal oxidation. Microscopic observation using digital microscope indicates the increases of micro-crack and surface roughness as thermal oxidation makes a progress. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy result suggests the increase of carbonyl index value on the surface of thermally exposed HDPE, indicating that the hydrocarbon groups on the HDPE surface undergo the thermal oxidation. The long-term life time of HDPE could be predicted by carrying out an accelerated life test using Arrhenius model. In addition, the lifetime equation of HDPE is suggested in order to estimate the failure time at various operating temperatures."
a fast and differentiated localization method for complex surfaces inspection,2015,"['Differentiated localization', 'Dynamic weighted least square', 'Precision inspection', 'Weighting parameters']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Although significant progress has been made in free-form surface inspection, it remains a difficult problem in some tough situations.For a complex part with multiple freeform surfaces, different quality requirements are often assigned to different surface regions to guarantee the part functionality and/or assembly relations. In this case, the existing localization methods, which treat each individual surface without discrimination, are prone to over rejection of some qualified parts. In this paper, a new localization method is proposed to tackle this problem. It features in that a novel dynamic weighting strategy is introduced in the iterative optimization process to make the localization in favor of the surfaces with higher quality requirements. This strategy can avoid improper scrap of parts in inspection and proves to be more reasonable for the quality evaluation of complex parts. In addition, a distinct fast algorithm is proposed to solve the localization optimization problem. It needs only to solve a 4-order linear system to determine the rigid transformation in each iteration. This solving algorithm is much faster than the popular quaternion-based algorithm for the weighted optimization model. Experiments on a simulated example and a real integral impeller are included to verify the validity and practicability of the proposed algorithm."

But early OHS movement driven by ‘bottom-up’ approach challenged this process and tried to build a different kind of OHS citizenship. Meanwhile, medical professionals played a leading role in early OHS movement. But in course of time, the initiative in OHS movement shifted from medical professionals to labor unions, and labor unions systematically organized the OHS movement in the era of KTUC and KCTU. In this period, the relationship between experts and rank-and-file workers also changed from ‘mobilizing external alternative experts’ model to ‘cultivating OHS activists by unions themselves and coalition with external alternative experts’ model. Before long, the weakening of unionism due to the economic crisis in 1997 and labor market flexibilization accompanied by temporary decline and internal discord of OHS movement. During this time, there were fierce debates on expertise and institutionalization of OHS between OHS activists. But some attempts at the local level took this opportunity to extend ‘workers’ right to participate’ to shop-floor level.

In doing so, the study utilized secondary teacher-, principal-, and school survey data from the second year of 2012 Gyeonggi Education Panel Study and applied to a two-level Hierarchical Linear Model. Among teacher characteristics, the study found that male teachers, head and master teachers, and teachers who wanted to work at the present school were more likely to agree with principals on school management practices. In addition, teacher efficacy were positively associated with agreement between teachers and principals. Among school characteristics, principals who knew well local and national educational policies and innovation-oriented schools were less likely to be in an agreement with their teachers on school management, while openness of school climate was positively related to teacher-principal agreement. Based on these findings, the study suggested that school management practices should be transformed in a way to enhance autonomy and professionalism of teachers, diagnostic tools of school organizational culture should be developed and disseminated, and further principals should hold consultations with teachers before introducing and implementing school policies."

According to Groome and Webb-Michael, there should be the dialectic conversations between congregation’s life and gospel at Christian liturgy as the core context of faith formation and transformation. Christian education needs to help congregation members to participate in liturgy and Christian practices actively with critical reflections on their daily lives in light of gospel, to live their lives as authentic Christian life in the world, and to provide them with appropriate education for liturgy and Christian practices as a lifelong journey. This study raises the following generative questions: “To what extent do the current texts for educational ministry manual help students to experience liturgy as the core context for their faith formation and transformation?” “If there are limits, what needs to be challenged and changed?” With these questions in mind, this study critically analyzes the current texts for educational ministry manual of Korean Church (PCK), and identifies Christian educational implications for the building of the better educational ministry. I hope that this study will help students not only participate in liturgy by linking their own daily lives in light of gospel, but also take a lifelong pilgrim journey by continuously learning and practicing authentic Christian life within the church as the body of Christ."

This paper deals with a FLP whose objective value is fuzzy. And the right hand sides of convergent equality constraints are fuzzy numbers. We assume that the membership function of the objective value is piecewise linear and those of the right hand side are trapezoidal. Each of these trapezoidal functions can be algebraically replaced with three linear functions. Then the FLP problem is transformed into the Zimmermann's symmetric model. The fuzzy solution based on the max-min rule can be obtained by solving the crisp linear programming problem derived from the symmetric model. A numerical example has illustrated our approach. The application of our approach to the inconsistent linear system can enable generate us to get define the useful and flexible inexact solutions within acceptable tolerance. Further research is required to generalize the membership function.

(1)「태극도설」에 나타난 건곤남녀와 만물화생의 선후문제이다. 성담은 인간존재인 남녀와 만물의 선후문제를 ‘기화(氣化)’와 ‘형화(形化)’의 맥락으로 풀이한다.「태극도설」은 전자에 주목한 것이다. 그리고 그것은 사물의 질료적 물상성보다는 인간의 존재적 영명성을 주목한 결과라는 것이 성담의 입장이다. 이러한 견해는 성담이 남치태에게 보낸 서간문의 내용에서 발견된다. (2) ‘중정인의’의 선후문제와 체용의 문제를 다룬다. 이것은 중정인의가 오행에 각각 배속된다고 본 주자의 입장에 대한 점검이다. 그 선후문제는 체용의 관계와 밀접한 관련을 갖는다. 그리고 무엇보다 중요한 것은 인간의 주체성이 인의라는 도덕성에 준거한다는 점이다. 인간은 ‘인의’와 ‘중정’을 정하여 인격적 표준을 구현해야만 할 사명을 가진 존재이다. 그런데 성담은 ‘인의’와 ‘중정’도 음양과 오행의 정수로부터 나온다는 것이 태극도설 의 견해라고 본 것이다. 이러한 견해는 성담이 김규정에게 보낸서간문의 내용에서 발견된다. 이상의 내용이 성담이 본「태극도설」에 대한 인간학적 해석의 내용이다. 성담은「태극도설」의 인간관에 특히 주목하면서, 주자학적 ‘원인론(原人論)’을 통해 ‘성인도통설’의 철학적 근거를 확보한다. 그것은 당대의 군주였던 정조가 본 ‘군주도통설’의 입장과는 상반된 것이었다는 점도 주목할 만한 사안이다. 성담에게 있어서는「태극도설」이야말로 ‘성인도통설’ 의 이론적 진원지와 다를 바 없는 중요한 것으로 인식되었음이 분명하다.","The focus of this paper is on the interpretation of the Diagram of the Superme Ultimate(太極圖說) in terms of the anthropological matters of Song, Hwan-Gi(宋煥箕).

This discourse is about the ontogeny and ethics, which is the subject of this paper. This paper contains the followings.  The first, the matter of cosmogony. He interpreted the sequenceof cosmogony as the matter of the Chi(氣) change and the transformation. The Diagram of the Superme Ultimate is focused on the first. He interpreted this character of the Diagram of the Superme Ultimate as the reason that the Diagram of the Superme Ultimate is mainly related with the ontological brightness of human rather than materialness of things. This thought is written in the letter that is sent to Nam, Chi-Tae. The second is about the sequence of zhongzhengrenyi(中正仁義) and the matter of tiyong(體用). This is thought to certificate the argument of Zhuzi(朱子), who thought zhongzhengrenyi each is divided into Five Phases. The sequence in that division is closely related the relation of tiyong. It is the most important that the subjectivity of human is based on the morality, that is, renyi . The human beings should realize the ideal model in terms of renyi and zhongzheng. He thought the argument of the Diagram of the Superme Ultimate to be that renyi and zhongzheng originated from the essence of Yinyang and Five Phases. This argument is found in the letter that is sent to Kim, Guy-Jung. He, focusing on the view of human of the Diagram of the Superme Ultimate, proposed the philosophical basis on the matter of daotong(道統) through yuanren(原人) theory of Zhuzi. The fact that his proposal is contrary to the theory of daotong that is proposed by the King Jungjo(正祖) should be emphasized.

Safety as railway subbase course material was evaluated using modeling. As a result, absorption amount of slag, Cd and Cu, was shown higher than gravel and Pb along with Zn showed higher absorption amount of gravel. However, absorption amount of slag was shown higher than gravel used as railway subbase course material as time passes by. Absorption features had more suitable determination coefficient of heavy metals in warm absorption type such as Langnmuir compared to warm absorption type like Freundlich. To add, they showed less transformation by about 10% compared to gravel in safety evaluation through modeling. This is a railway subbase course material that prevents water outflow of heavy metal thus we can know slag is needed to be used."

The styles of representing landscape in a pictorial map may be classified into 3 types (cubic, plane, and eclectic projection) in respect of emphasis either on frontality or on floor plan. However, 3 types of projection style do not correspond to a series of development in periodical styles.  Every Jinju Fortress map of the late Joseon period depicts always the same landscape of Jinju province, resulting in some similar features or relationship with each other, i.e., mimetic succession. If an artisan happened to draw a new map just following precedent model and making slight renditions, he had been in the process of mimetic succession. A secondary copy may get some features of the deleted, the deformed, or the added in comparing to a model. We should remind that it is not necessary for the copy to represent exactly what has happened, appeared, or transformed in reality. And the way of surveying the contents in a map with features characteristic of mimetic succession is to get informations not about the time of making but about the end time of using it.  I have surveyed 14 copies of Jinju Fortress maps today, 10 of which are depicted in cubic projection style. I have also distributed them into low groups with some connoiseurship about stylistic details and mimetic successions.

인간의 욕망과 모방 - 르네 지라르의 사회인류학적 관점에서 -,2015,"['모방적 욕망', '짝패', '차이의 위기', '희생양', '그리스도를 본 받아', 'Mimetic Desire', 'Double', 'Crisis of Difference', 'Scapegoat', 'Imitation of Christ']","현대 사회에 들어와서 현대 문명의 위기에 대한 소리가 높다. 우리는 그 위기 뒤에서 인간의 탐욕과 폭력성이 어른거리고 있음을 볼 수 있는데, 프랑스의 사회인류학자 르네 지라르의 욕망 이론은 문제 해결의 단초를 제공할 수 있을 것이다. 그의 이론의 핵심은 인간의 욕망은 모방적이라는 것인데, 그 요체는 두 가지다. 하나는 사람들은 스스로 어떤 것을 욕망하는 것이 아니라 타인의 욕망을 모방한다는 것이고, 다른 하나는 욕망의 주체는 욕망의 대상을 원하는 것이 아니라 욕망을 매개하는 중개자처럼 되려고 한다는 것이다. 어떤 사람이 좋은 가방을 가지고 싶다고 할 때 그 욕망은 그에게서 스스로 나온 것이 아니라 그가 그 가방을 들고 있는 어떤 멋진 사람을 본 순간 생겨난다는 것이다. 그때 그 사람은 그 가방을 원하는 것이 아니라 그 사람처럼 멋지게 되고 싶은 것이다. 또한 그는 욕망의 중개에는 두 가지 종류가 있다고 주장하였다. 첫째는 외적 중개로서 욕망의 주체와 중개자 사이의 거리가 먼 것이고, 둘째는 내적 중개로서 욕망의 주체와 중개자 사이의 거리가 가까운 것이다. 따라서 내적 중개에는 욕망의 주체가 가까이에 있는 중개자를 모방하려고 해서 그 사이에서 경쟁과 갈등이 생긴다. 지라르는 그때 두 사람은 서로가 같은 대상을 욕망하여 서로에게 장애가 되고, 갈등이 깊어질 때 폭력은 필연적으로 된다고 하면서 그 관계를 짝패라고 불렀다. 그는 짝패에서 “차이의 위기”에 주목했는데, 욕망의 주체가 욕망의 중개자를 모방하다가 두 사람이 거의 비슷해지면 두 사람 사이에서 경쟁이 치열해져서 위기가 다가오기 때문이다. 그때 두 사람은 같은 대상을 차지하려고 해서 두 사람 사이에서는 폭력적인 상황을 벌어지게 된다. 그런데 “차이의 소멸”로 인한 갈등, 경쟁, 폭력은 한 사회를 혼란 속으로 몰아넣어서 사람들은 사회에 위기가 올 때는 희생양을 선택하여 위기의 원인을 그에게 쏟아 붓고 그를 처형함으로써 위기를 극복하곤 하였다. 그러나 시간이 지나면 위기는 계속해서 오게 되어 사회에서는 종교를 만들어서 희생양을 제의로 제도화시켰다. 하지만 이런 평화는 거짓된 성스러움에 기초를 둔 평화로서 항구적인 것은 되지 못한다고 지라르는 비판한다. 그러면 사람들은 어떻게 하여야 할 것인가? 지라르는 그 문제에 대해서 다음과 같은 두 가지 해결책을 제시하였다. 첫째는 모든 신화적 종교들의 토대가 되는 희생양 메커니즘의 허위를 폭로하는 것인데, 기독교가 먼저 그 일을 하였고, 둘째는 모든 사람들이 자신의 개인적 욕망을 찾고 그리스도를 본 받아 사는 것이다. 즉 현대인들은 기독교가 신화적 종교들에 있는 거짓된 성스러움의 구조를 폭로하고 희생양의 무고함을 밝히면서 폭력의 악순환으로부터 벗어난 것을 계속 지켜나가고, 자신의 욕망이 자발적인 것이 아니라는 사실을 깨닫고 그리스도를 모방함으로써 현대 사회가 유혹하는 사탄적 욕망에서 벗어나야 한다는 것이다. 이러한 그의 생각은 현대에 만연되어 있는 무신론적 허무주의와 회의주의를 극복할 수 있는 사상이라는 생각이 든다.","Nowadays we see many things which represent the crisis of the modern civilization in our society. We know there are human greed and violence behind that crisis. It seems that a french social anthropologist René Girard's theory of mimetic desire can afford the solution which helps us to surmount that difficult position. The core of his theory is the mimetic aspect of human desire. We consider that its essence is two fold. One is that people do not desire themselves but imitate other's desire, the other is that the subject of the desire does not want to get the object of desire but to be like the mediator of that desire. For example, if one wants to get a chic bag that desire does not arise from his/her inside but when he/she sees a human being who hold that chic bag. He/She wants to be a chic person. Girard said that there are two sorts of mediation of desire; one is external mediation and the other is internal mediation. In the former case the distance between the subject of desire and the model(mediator) is far away, in the latter case the distance is very near. So there arise many conflicts between two persons or two groups as they want the same object of desire. Girard named two persons who struggle to get same thing ""the double"" and there breaks many conflicts and violences between them. So the principal source of violence between human beings is mimetic rivalry resulting from imitation of model who becomes a rival or of a rival who becomes a model. Gigard insists that the scapegoat mechanism of mythical religion comes from the collective violence as the scapegoat transforms the chaos of the mimetic crisis into a new social order. But he insists also that peace can not maintain long as it stands on the false sacred. So human being needed new scapegoats and new religions. This continues in the history of human being. But Girard suggests two solutions, one is to disclose the falsity of the scapegoat mechanism of mythical religion and the other is to imitate Jesus in order to surmount the crisis of our society."

Authentic leader builds LMX relationship with an employee who has their values n d beliefs of a similar authentic leader through having role-making process and social exchange with each employee in order to achieve the goals of the organization. And authentic leader holds to remain in their organization of an employee on formation of trust with him or her through expressing their true thoughts and feelings as well as sharing information. In addition, authentic leader improves organizational commitment of an employee who identify with the goals of the organization through participating in the decision-making in order to collect a variety of views and opinions of an employee. On the other hand, transformational leader who has transformational appearance but lacks the authenticity and truthfulness of the inner and promote their own interests only, and exists in the gap between the usual skill and transformational leader's words and actions, doesn’t have positive effect on an employee attitudes and behaviors. Second, the mediating effects of LMX in the relationship between leadership (transformational and authentic) and organizational commitment were not verified. Authentic leader builds LMX relationship with an employee who has their values a nd beliefs of a similar authentic leader, but not effect on organizational commitment. So a variety of variables that connects between LMX and organizational commitment need to find.

As a result, theUzbek economic transformation can be categorized as a type of gradual and restrictive outward-opening fromthe perspective of speed & sequence on the basis of system transformation path model, which may possibly be evaluated as a case of successful gradualismlike China as well. In a concreteway, the experience of theUzbek successful transitioncomprises a economic recovery and stability in the 1990s during the early period of transition, and then robust economic growth in 2000s and until quite recently. But, in fact the Uzbek economic performance can be said to achieved by economic initial conditions(rich natural resource endowment and favorable international price to resource export) and centralized economic policy(market control and import substitution industrialization policy)with institutional initial conditions, that is the legacies of centrally planned economic systemin Soviet era. Therefore, when only depending on economic conditions(natural resources and international market price) and self-sufficiency fromexternal shock, there could be a risk of overestimation to theUzbek real performance. In that sense it may turn out that the Uzbek growth puzzle or the Uzbek paradox without structural reform conclude to the Uzbek disguised growth paradox in the long run. For sustaining economic growth substantial reform moves is needed in Uzbekistan.

This paper presents a method of integrating the national R&D data and assists of users to navigate the integrated data via using a knowledge map service. The knowledge map service is built by using a lightweight ontology and a topic modeling method. The national R&D data is integrated with the research project as its center, i.e., the other R&D data such as research papers, patents, and reports are connected with the research project as its outputs. The lightweight ontology is used to represent the simple relationships between the integrated data such as project-outputs relationships, document-author relationships, and document-topic relationships. Knowledge map enables us to infer further relationships such as co-author and co-topic relationships. To extract the relationships between the integrated data, a Relational Data-to-Triples transformer is implemented. Also, a topic modeling approach is introduced to extract the document-topic relationships. A triple store is used to manage and process the ontology data while preserving the network characteristics of knowledge map service.  Knowledge map can be divided into two types: one is a knowledge map used in the area of knowledge management to store, manage and process the organizations’ data as knowledge, the other is a knowledge map for analyzing and representing knowledge extracted from the science & technology documents. This research focuses on the latter one. In this research, a knowledge map service is introduced for integrating the national R&D data obtained from National Digital Science Library (NDSL) and National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS), which are two major repository and service of national R&D data servicing in Korea. A lightweight ontology is used to design and build a knowledge map. Using the lightweight ontology enables us to represent and process knowledge as a simple network and it fits in with the knowledge navigation and visualization characteristics of the knowledge map. The lightweight ontology is used to represent the entities and their relationships in the knowledge maps, and an ontology repository is created to store and process the ontology. In the ontologies, researchers are implicitly connected by the national R&D data as the author relationships and the performer relationships. A knowledge map for displaying researchers’ network is created, and the researchers’ network is created by the co-authoring relationships of the national R&D documents and the co-participation relationships of the national R&D projects.  To sum up, a knowledge map-service system based on topic modeling and ontology is introduced for processing knowledge about the national R&D data such as research projects, papers, patent, project reports, and Global Trends Briefing (GTB) data. The system has goals 1) to integrate the national R&D data obtained from NDSL and NTIS, 2) to provide a semantic & topic based information search on the integrated data, and 3) to provide a knowledge map services based on the semantic analysis and knowledge processing. The S&T information such as research papers, research reports, patents and GTB are daily updated from NDSL, and the R&D projects information including their participants and output information are updated from the NTIS. The S&T information and the national R&D information are obtained and integrated to the integrated database. Knowledge base is constructed by transforming the relational data into triples referencing R&D ontology. In addition, a topic modeling method is employed to extract the relationships between the S&T documents and topic keyword/s representing the documents. The topic modeling approach enables us to extract the relationships and topic keyword/s based on the semantics, not based on the simple keyword/s. Lastly, we show an experiment on the const"

First, grey prediction model GM (1, 1) and time series model ARIMA (p, d, q) are adopted to predict the outside humidity over the next four hours, respectively. Then, considering the nonstationary property of the humidity sequence, wavelet analysis theory is applied to decompose the humidity sequence into different scales in order to reduce the randomness of the original sequence. Furthermore, the low frequency signal and high frequency one are predicted by GM (1, 1) and time series model ARIMA (p, d, q), respectively. Finally, simulation studies are carried out to compare the three prediction methods."
simulation of superelastic sma helical springs,2015,"['shape memory alloy', 'helical spring', 'martensite transformation', 'constitutive model', 'finite element method']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Shape memory alloy (SMA) helical springs have found a large number of different applications in industries including biomedical devices and actuators. According to the application of SMA springs in different actuators, they are usually under tension and torsion loadings. The ability of SMAs in recovering inelastic strains is due to martensitic phase transformation between austenite and martensite phases. Stress or temperature induced martensite transformation induced of SMAs is a remarkable property which makes SMA springs more superior in comparison with traditional springs. The present paper deals with the simulation of SMA helical spring at room temperature. Three-dimensional phenomenological constitutive model is used to describe superelastic behavior of helical spring. This constitutive model is implemented as a user subroutine through ABAQUS STANDARD (UMAT), and the process of the implementation is presented. Numerical results show that the developed constitutive model provides an appropriate approach to captures the general behavior of SMA helical springs."

The analysis results are as follows. First, the principal's transformational leadership had a significant impact on job satisfaction of teachers, and it had the most impact on school organization vitality climate. Second, teacher efficacy showed both direct and meditating effects between research variables, which indicates that the principal needs to devise a financial support system and develop programs to enhance teacher efficacy, ultimately increasing the job satisfaction of teachers. Third, intergroup structure invariance, measurement invariance and partial scalar invariance were all satisfied. Latent mean differences in teacher groups by gender revealed that male teachers had a higher degree of awareness on the transformational leadership and teacher's job satisfaction. The latent mean differences depending on the position showed that head teachers had a higher awareness of the transformational leadership, school vitality climate and teacher's job satisfaction compared to general teachers. Fourth, the path that represents a significant difference between male and female teachers was not found with respect to teacher coefficients between teacher groups. Path coefficient differences depending on the position also found that the influence of transformational leadership on the school vitality climate was greater to the group of head teachers, whereas that of school organization vitality climate on the teacher's job satisfaction was significant only to the group of general teachers. In addition, the influence of teacher efficacy on the job satisfaction was greater to the group of general teachers. These findings suggest that the principal's leadership is not applied to the school members in the same manner since there was a difference in the degree of influence and awareness on each research variable according to background variables of teachers. Therefore, principles are expected to take these points into account when they exert transformational leadership."

This study develops a model in which transformational leadership affects team commitment and service performance through the types of conflict resolution adopted by team members. The data were collected from a survey of 244 service team members in foodservice industry. Structural Equation Models revealed that transformational leadership promotes team commitment and thereby team service performance by encouraging teams to adopt types of conflict resolution(cooperative, competitive and avoidant types). Cooperative and avoidant types of conflict resolution had direct effects on team commitment. However, competitive types of conflict resolution had no direct effects on team commitment. In addition, cooperative and avoidant types of conflict resolution had mediating role between transformational leadership and team commitment. Team commitment had mediating role between cooperative, avoidant types of conflict resolution and team service performance. These results suggest that transformational leadership may help team members manage conflicts for their mutual benefit. Transformational leaders can also help team members understand the potential value of managing conflict cooperatively and help them develop relevant skills to discuss their views open-mindedly. The conflict resolution is an important mechanism through which transformational leadership enhances team commitment and, in turn, achieves higher team service performance.

The LSP mathematical model is formulated with the average geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) as the criterion. To achieve an optimization solution, a tolerant factor based complete stratified series approach and grid searching method are utilized to obtain the possible optimal BS placement. Because of the LSP model utilization, the proposed algorithm has wider application scenarios with different accuracy requirements over different trajectory segments.

a fast tu size decision method for hevc rqt coding,2015,"['TU size decision', 'HEVC/H.265', 'RQT coding', 'video compression']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The emerging high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard adopts the quadtree-structured transform unit (TU) in the residual quadtree (RQT) coding. Each TU allows to be split into four equal sub-TUs recursively. The RQT coding is performed for all the possible transform depth levels to achieve the highest coding efficiency, but it requires a very high computational complexity for HEVC encoders. In order to reduce the computational complexity requested by the RQT coding, in this paper, we propose a fast TU size decision method incorporating an adaptive maximum transform depth determination (AMTD) algorithm and a full check skipping - early termination (FCS-ET) algorithm. Because the optimal transform depth level is highly content-dependent, it is not necessary to perform the RQT coding at all transform depth levels. By the AMTD algorithm, the maximum transform depth level is determined for current treeblock to skip those transform depth levels rarely used by its spatially adjacent treeblocks. Additionally, the FCS-ET algorithm is introduced to exploit the correlations of transform depth level between four sub-CUs generated by one coding unit (CU) quadtree partitioning.

In the paper, both premium income and agent income of the regional post offices are employed as output variables while market orientation, self-effort and the number of agents, their ages and duration of jobs are used as input variables. To measure efficiency, we apply not only data envelopment analysis (DEA) as a non-parametric method but also stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) as a parametric method. In particular, the paper focuses on analyzing error terms which can be decomposed into random and efficiency errors in order to check whether there exists significant difference in efficiency among postal offices. We also employ Cobb Douglas multiplicative models for log-transformed data to reflect the relationship between the original input and output variables considering the law of diminishing return. The empirical results using data of total 120 postal offices reveal that for premium income as output, the model errors are mainly due to random errors rather than efficiency errors. That is, premium income model is fully explained by the input variables. On the other hand, for agent income as output, the model errors come from both random and efficiency errors but the latter is much bigger, which indicates there exists difference in efficiency. Namely, agent income is not fully explained by the input variables. Another important finding is that self-learning efforts of agents significantly affect their income. In addition, market orientation of the post offices also works for improvement of the outputs for the group maintaining a higher level of market orientation. So we recommend the postal insurance to enhance market orientation to a certain threshold and also encourage the agents to make self-learning efforts."

As part of the KIAPS package for observation processing (KPOP) system for data assimilation, preprocessing, and quality control modules for bending-angle measurements of global positioning system radio occultation (GPS-RO) data have been implemented and examined. The GPS-RO data processing system is composed of several steps for checking observation locations, missing values, physical values for Earth radius of curvature, and geoid undulation. An observation-minus-background check is implemented by use of a one-dimensional observational bending-angle operator, and tangent point drift is also considered in the quality control process. We have tested GPS-RO observations utilized by the Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA) within KPOP, based on both the KMA global model and the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model with Spectral Element dynamical core (CAM-SE) as a model background. Background fields from the CAM-SE model are incorporated for the preparation of assimilation experiments with the KIAPS local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) data assimilation system, which has been successfully implemented to a cubed-sphere model with unstructured quadrilateral meshes. As a result of data processing, the bending-angle departure statistics between observation and background show significant improvement. Also, the first experiment in assimilating GPS-RO bending angle from KPOP within KIAPS-LETKF shows encouraging results.</p> </P>"

It is doing a role of key linkage to the monetaristic approach of long run exchange rate determination and open macro-economic analysis. Therefore its rigorous test and understanding are critical for modern economic theory evolution. However, according to Rogoff (1996), Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000), the variability of real exchange rate is larger than the level that is expected by the present models explaining the PPP deviation. According to Frankel and Rose (1996), Cheung and Lai (1998, 2000a, 2000b), Papell (1997), Wu and Wu (2001), the half life from PPP deviation to equilibrium adjustment is roughly 3～5 and thus disequilibrium adjustment speed is quite slow. Obviously this adjustment time is too much long than it expected by the speed is price rigidity models; i.e., 1～2 years. Therefore it is regarded as an important puzzle of international economic theory which demands fundamentally different sight to explain the connection of exchange rate with the price. With respect to this issue, remarkable hypothesis/evidences have been suggested to explain slow purchasing power adjustment. Firstly, Engel and Morley (2001), asserts that the root of the PPP puzzle may be resolved by allowing different speeds of convergence for nominal exchange rates and prices. In contrast to usual rational-expectations sticky-price models, which impose equivalent reversion speed for nominal exchange rates and prices, they examine an empirical model that supposes those variables to adjust at different speeds. Empirical evidences from state-space model estimation show that while prices converge relatively fast, nominal exchange rates converge slowly. It suggests that the lethargic rate of PPP reversion may come largely from slow nominal exchange rate adjustment rather than from slow price adjustment. Engel and Morley (2001, 24) conjectured that “bubbles or herding might temporarily send the exchange rate off on disequilibrium paths that result in the appearance of slow convergence to the equilibrium.” Cheung et al. (2004), using vector error correction model, estimated the speeds at which the individual variables revert to their long-run values. Their results confirmed those of Engel and Morley (2001) that nominal exchange rates do converge at a much slower rate than prices. Half-lives of nominal exchange rates are estimated to be from 3 to 6 years, while half-lives of prices are found to be just about 1 to 2 years. They also found that about 60~90% of PPP disequilibrium adjustment takes place through nominal exchange rate adjustment. They conclude that if nominal exchange rates converge much more slowly than prices, the PPP reversion speed can be slower than the price convergence speed, as described by the PPP puzzle. Wu et al. (2011) also found that main findings of Cheung et al. (2004) are robust to possible misspecifications in the true data-generating process (DGP). They examined the source of a real exchange-rate adjustment based on the impulse-response function constructed from local projections proposed by Jorda (2005) when the DGP is unknown. They showed that nominal exchange-rate adjustments dominate in the reversion toward PPP regardless of a nominal exchange-rate shock or a price shock. This paper examines these view that not the price but the bubble in the exchange rate mainly explains the slow adjustment of exchange rate to the PPP equilibrium especially focusing on the conjecture of Engel and Morley (2001, 24) through following two fold approaches. Firstly, following Kim (2014), we test whether there is an I(1) stochastic bubble trend, which is independent with an I(1) trend of price in exchange rate. For this, we exploit a transformed error correction model and Beveridge-Nelson decomposition. Secondly, the shock of aforementioned bubble trend may induce a longrun/sustainable response of the PPP disequilibrium error when the cointegration vector is different from it implied by the PPP (possibly due to the barrier/frictions for trade such as tariff, transportation costs which hinders the PPP arbitrage.) We theoretically expect the response of PPP disequilibrium error from which the part induced by the barrier/frictions for trade are deleted may be mainly affected by the ‘sticky’ price as conventional approach explains."

Given the prior research mainly regarding the cognitive trust built between trustors and trustees, we proposed that relation benefits, relation norm, support, transformational leadership, new product development, dependence, communication, formalization, fairness, conflicts, and transaction-specific investments would influence ability, benevolence, and integrity which are trustors’ perceived components of trustee trustworthiness. Specifically, relationship benefits, support, transformational leadership, new product development, dependence, and transaction-specific investments were proposed to influence trustors’ perception on trustees’ ability; relationship benefits, relation norm, support, transformational leadership, communication, fairness, conflicts, and transaction-specific investments were proposed to influence trustors’ perception on trustees’ benevolence; relation norm, transformational leadership, communication, formalization, fairness, conflicts were proposed to influence trustors’ perception on trustees’ benevolence.

"국가 리스크 관리를 위한 기후변화 적응역량 구축,평가 : 기후변화에 따른 국가 리스크 정량화 연구(2) -연안시스템을 중심으로",2015,"['기후변화', '해수면 상승', '연안역', '취약성', '리스크', '적응', 'Climate Change', 'Sea Level Rise', 'Coastal System', 'Adaptation', 'Risk Management']","본 연구는 최근 국제사회의 리스크 기반 기후변화 적응 프레임에 대처하고 “미래 기후변화의 높은 불확실성 하에서의 정책결정”의 속성을 가지는 기후변화 적응대책 수립의 과학적이고 정량적 기반 구축을 통한 국내외 기후변화 취약성 평가 및 적응대책 수립의 활성화를 목적으로 하며, 2차년도(2015년)에는 기후변화 리스크의 정량적 평가를 위한 기후변화 확률함수 분석ㆍ선정, 수치모델을 통한 기후변화 영향함수 산출, 피해 및 리스크 함수를 산출하였다. 미래 기후변화 시나리오는 온실가스 배출시나리오 및 기후모델에 의한 불확실성이 높게 존재하고, 기후요소 중 해양 기후변화는 이들 요소에 해양 내부시스템에 대한 불확실성이 중첩되며, 해수면 상승의 경우 해수면 상승 잠재력이 가장 큰 빙상역학불확실성이 매우 큰 상태이다. 이로 인하여 IPCC AR5(IPCC, 2013)는 66%의 확률범위인“Likely” 범위의 중간신뢰도에 대해서만 그 결과를 제시하고 있다. 본 연구에서는 정량적이고 전체 확률범위를 제시하고 있는 Jevrejeva et al.(2014)의 RCP 8.5 시나리오를 리스크 평가 시나리오로 선정하였다. 동 시나리오에 의한 95% 상한값은 1.8m로서 기존기여성분별 상한치 합인 1.9m에 근접하며 주요 국가의 상한시나리오를 모두 포함하고 있다. 영향함수 도출은 미국 공병단에서 개발하여 운용 중인 Coastal Modeling System(CMS)모델을 이용하였다. 대상 해역은 2003년 태풍 매미로 인해 큰 피해를 입은 마산만으로 선정하였으며, 해수면 상승과 100년 빈도 태풍 발생에 따른 영향을 평가하기 위한 시나리오를 수립하고 시나리오별 침수.범람역을 산출하였다. 영향함수 도출에 앞서 CMS 모델을이용한 태풍 매미 재현을 통해 마산만 해역 일대의 조위와 파랑의 재현성을 평가하는 등 결과의 신뢰성 확보를 위해 노력하였다. 시나리오별 CMS 모델 결과를 보면, 해수면상승이 고려되지 않은 현 상황에서 100년 빈도 태풍에 의한 평균침수심은 1.7m, 침수면적은 7.82㎢로 평가되었다. 0~2m까지 해수면 상승을 고려한 경우, 침수심과 침수면적은 선형적으로 증가되어 해수면이 2m 상승한 상황에서 평균 침수심은 3.0m로 분석되었으며, 마산의 10.17㎢ 일대가 침수될 가능성이 있는 것으로 평가되었다. 해수면 상승 및 100년 빈도 태풍 시나리오에 따른 피해함수 평가를 위해 국내외 침수피해 추정방법을 조사하고 주요 국가별 침수피해액 산정 방법론을 조사하였다. 조사된 대부분의 침수에 의한 피해 평가는 손실함수(Damage Function)로 불리는 침수심-피해곡선을 이용하는 방법이 사용되고 있으며, 이를 통해 침수심별 피해액을 추정하고 있다. 침수범람에 대한 대표적 피해 평가 방법론으로 미국 연방위기관리청(Federal EmergencyManagement Agency, FEMA)과 국립건물과학연구소(National Institute of BuildingSciences, NIBS)가 개발한 HAZUS-MH(HAZard US Multi-Hazard) 모델, 해수면 상승시나리오에 따른 피해액을 평가한 Quinn et al.(2013) 연구, 그리고 우리나라 홍수피해 정량화에 적용된 바 있는 다차원 홍수피해 산정기법(Multi-Dimensional Flood DamageAnalysis, MD-FDA)에 대해 검토하였다. 이들 평가 방법 중 우리나라 실정에 부합하고 적용 사례가 있는 다차원 홍수피해 산정법을 마산 해역에 적용하여 해수면 상승 시나리오 및 100년 빈도 태풍에 대한 피해액을 산정하였다. 마산만 일대는 해수면 상승을 고려하지않고, 태풍 매미 규모의 태풍 내습만 반영한 경우에도 침수 면적이 7.82㎢로 예상되며, 이에 따른 예상 침수 가구는 주택 1,952호, 아파트 116동, 기타(업체 수) 3,669개소이고 예상 이재민수는 7,561명으로 분석되었다. 해수면 상승에 따른 침수지역 현황은 0.1m간격으로 0에서 2m 상승 시까지 분석되었으며, SLR 2.0m 상승 시(10.17㎢) 주택 3,037호, 아파트 144동, 기타(업체 수) 4,527개소, 예상 이재민수 11,171명으로 나타났다. 이에 대한 자산가치는 시나리오별로 SLR 0.0∼2.0m에 4조 9,953억 원∼6조 1,471억 원으로 평가되었고, 다차원 홍수피해 산정방법에 따른 피해액은 해수면 상승 시나리오 SLR 0.0~2.0m별로 3조 5,828억 원∼5조 6,763억 원으로 평가되었다. 기존 100년 빈도 태풍 및 해수면 시나리오에 의하여 산출된 우리나라 사례지역의 리스크함수는 기존 선진국의 리스크 함수와는 달리 기후확률함수와 유사한 형태로 나타났다. 사례지역은 미래의 기후변화가 아닌 현재의 이상기후에 의해서도 매우 높은 취약성을 나타내고 있으며 기후변화로 그 취약성이 누적될 것으로 전망되었다. 더불어 기후변화에 따른 취약성 전파가 크게 일어나지 않고 연안역 저지대에 피해가 집중되고 있는 점은과거부터 진행되어 온 연안 매립지 조성과 밀접한 관계가 있는 것으로 분석되었다. 본연구의 리스크 평가는 태풍에 대한 미래 시나리오 확률함수 선정을 통한 리스크 평가 확대 및 우리나라 연안시스템에 대한 추가 리스크 평가를 통하여 우리나라 연안시스템의 취약특성을 파악하고 적응 방향을 정량적으로 제시하는 추가적이고 지속적인 연구가 수행되어야 한다. 본 연구의 예비 취약성에 대한 적응정책 방향과 관련하여 기존의 해안 자연시스템을 훼손하는 방어(Protection) 및 공격(Attack) 전략을 유지할 것인가, 가속되는 기후변화의 최적적응 선택으로 제시되는 변형(Transformation)을 통한 자연시스템의 보전 및 복원과 인간시스템 이주 및 순응 등의 혼합 전략을 통한 새로운 해안을 창조할 것인가에 대한논의와 연구도 미래 국가 적응전략과 연계하여 동시에 수행되어야 할 것으로 판단된다. 본 연구의 리스크 평가는 다양한 불확실성을 내포하고 있다. 이들 불확실성에는 기후시나리오(특히 빙상역학), 지형자료(DEM 등), 범람 모델, 사회ㆍ경제 자료(주거, 상가, 공장, 공공시설, 인프라 등), 피해평가 방법론 및 계수 등을 포함하며, 기후변화 정책결정의 반복적 특성과 병행하여 새로운 정보 및 자료를 통한 지속적이고 반복적인 평가가 필요하다.","We have quantified the risk of changes in the coastal system due to future climate change by multiplying the probability density function(PDF) of the IPCC(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) RCP(Representative Concentration Pathway) climate change scenario with a pdf ensemble modeling of inundation and its consequence to provide robust and scientific basis for adaptation policy in Korea. The probability density function adopted here is Jevrejeva et al.(2014) with a range of 95% probability of sea level rise up to 1.8m, the Coastal Modeling System(CMS) of the US Army Corps Engineers was used for inundation quantification with an increment of 1cm sea level rise by setting Masan Bay that had been seriously affected by Typhoon Maemi(2003) as the target area, and the Multi-Dimensional Flood Damage Analysis was used to estimate the cost of inundation damage as the consequence component of risk assessment. The preliminary results show inundation and its damages to coastal human system are considerable. Calculated risk function reproduced the probability density function of climate change very closely, which reveals that the coastal system is quite vulnerable to current extremes such as Typhoon, and the vulnerability will be increased with future climate change. We have also found that the high vulnerability in the coastal system is closely correlated with reclamation areas. These characteristics could imply high vulnerability of many man-made coastal systems in Korea considering that a massive area has been reclaimed in the past. The risk quantification framework of the study can be applied in the future to other coastal systems with new information, methodology, dataset and others."

This study is necessary to provide a design model for environmentally friendly cremation facilities in order to mitigate conflicts and transform social perception. The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to present a qualitative improvement in facilities to aid in the recognition and conversion of cremation facilities and (2) to propose a multicultural park for the local community and broader society. A literature review and the case study method were used to analyze political, social, and cultural awareness of the burial culture and to examine requirements for the memorial park and cremation facilities. A spatial design will be provided to expand and maximize public services and user convenience based on a site analysis. The proposed design strategies are: (1) Create a holistic atmosphere for commemoration; (2) Configure a hierarchical space layout; (3) Apply symbolic representation for each zone with natural elements; and (4) Provide a public cultural space. In conclusion, this study creates a practical design model for future memorial parks by providing a spatial utilization model and various design strategies while planning for new crematory facilities and other public avoidance facilities."

Analyzing the AAS and the distribution of affairs, this study identifies that the current relationship between the central government and local governments can be classified into the agent model where the central government exercises a strong control over local governments in the process of policy implementation as well as policy formation. Stressing that this type of relationship needs to be transformed into the partnership model or the inter-dependence model for the development of agriculture and rural communities, this study suggests the following policy directions:First, for the short term, more opportunities for local governments to participate in the agricultural policy formation and planning process need to be allowed while increasing their autonomy in the implementation process. For the long term, an establishment of an agency dealing with nationwide agricultural affairs is required to let local governments deal with their own affairs, which eventually will improve competitiveness of agriculture and rural communities. Second, local governments need to strengthen their planning function of agricultural policy by rearranging their agricultural organizational structures. Training and education to the personnels who are responsible for the planning and continuous experts' advice are also needed to increase the planning capacity of local governments. Third, to increase local autonomy and to secure financial responsibility, more blanket subsidies needs to be given to local governments. Fourth and finally, the distribution of agricultural affairs needs to be decided by using the bottom-up approach whereby the right of selection is given in order of primary local government-regional government-central government."

Whether, or how much, the employees raise a voice, or keep silent, is the most important variable that can explain the degree of organizational activation. This study examined the impact of leadership as the most critical antecedent, focused on the voice, and silence, of the employee, both of which are vital for activated communication in organizations. To highlight how leadership affects, this study adopted transformational, author-itative, and abusive leaderships to be examined. Also examined are the con-sequences of voice and silence, namely innovative behavior as a positive result and intent to leave as a negative one. The data was collected from 323 employees, in 17 work organizations. Structural equation models were employed to test the hypotheses. The results show that all three types of leadership exert significant effects on employee voice and silence, but their effects vary. Transformational leadership exerted significant influence on pro-social voice, but not on others. In other words, it does not soothe negative attitudes and behaviors. Authoritative leadership positively affected both defensive voice and silence, suggesting it stimulates defensive behavior (either voice or silence) rather than an obedient one. Abusive leadership showed significantly negative effects on the three behaviors, namely pro-social silence, defensive voice and silence as well. The results suggest strong needs for controlling abusive leadership in workplace. On the other hand, innovative behavior turned out to be positively associated with both types of voice behavior, namely pro-social and defensive voice. It suggests that, regardless of its motives, voice can make change and innovation. Intent to leave was positively associated with defensive silence, and negatively with pro-social voice. These findings are suggestive to the effectiveness values of employee voice and silence."

This trend is observed annually. Temperature and rainfall amount are influential factors in the change of sales amount. Sales amount increases at the start of spring and reach its height during summer period. Winter shows the least amount of sales. The sales amount of each retail store is predictable through this trend. Big retailers are already applying sales prediction models to assign budget and marketing cost to each store. The ordering system is enhanced through these models as well. These days, retailer's sales growth rate showed negative growth even when these models were attempted.

In addition, the exactnonlocal Reddy beam theory solution presented here should be useful to engineers designing nanoelectromechanical devices. The smallscaleeffect is considered based on nonlocal elasticity theory of Eringen. The nonlocal equations of motion are derived through Hamilton’sprinciple, and they are solved by applying DTM. Numerical results reveal that the proposed modeling and semi-analytical approachcan provide more accurate frequency results of the SWCNTs compared to analytical results and some cases in the literature. The detailedmathematical derivations are presented, and numerical investigations are performed, whereas emphasis is placed on investigating theeffect of several parameters such as small-scale effects, boundary conditions, mode number, thickness ratio, temperature change, andWinkler spring modulus on the natural frequencies of the SWCNTs in detail. The vibration behavior of SWCNTs is significantly influencedby these effects. Results indicate that the inclusion of size effect results in a decrease in nanobeam stiffness and leads to a decreasein natural frequency. Numerical results are presented to serve as benchmarks for future analyses of SWCNTs."

comparative analysis of the dwt-based denoising technique selection in noise-riding dcv of the li-ion battery pack,2015,"['Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)', 'Multiresolution analysis (MRA)', 'Denoising', 'Thresholding.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The noise-riding discharging/charging voltage (DCV) of the Li-Ion battery pack may result in erroneous equivalent circuit model (ECM)-based state-of-charge (SOC) estimation and state-of-health (SOH) prediction of the Li-Ion battery pack. Namely, the noisy DCV is intimately linked with a low battery management system (BMS) performance. Therefore, additional technique should be absolutely required for noise reduction of the DCV. This work presented an implementation of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based denoising technique that enables us to provide the de-noised DCV. Specifically, this work develops prior investigation one step further by performing a comparative analysis of the DWT-based denoising technique that uses different thresholding methods such as hard- and soft-thresholding. With regard to the denoising technique using hard-thresholding that retains a small number of coefficients, it is inevitable that the results are often smoothed at the expense of loosing information of the DCV. On the other hand, it is possible to acquire an improved noise-reduction of the DCV through the denoising technique using soft-thresholding retaining a large number of coefficients. Finally, selection of the proper thresholding method is a significant task in determining the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analytic results indicate the clear comparison by showing the SNR difference between two denoising techniques considering hard- and soft-thresholding. For reference, threshold value has been calculated by VisuShrink method."

EMD has been successfully applied for identification of mode shapes of structures based on input-output approaches. This paper aims to extend application of EMD for output-only identification of mode shapes of linear structures. In this regard, a new simple and efficient method based on band-pass filtering and EMD is proposed. Having rather accurate estimates of modal frequencies from measured responses, the proposed method is capable to extract the corresponding mode shapes. In order to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the proposed identification method, two case studies are considered. In the first case, the performance of the method is validated through the analysis of simulated responses obtained from an analytical structural model with known dynamical properties. The low-amplitude responses recorded from the UCLA Factor Building during the 2004 Parkfield earthquake are used in the second case to identify the first three mode shapes of the building in three different directions. The results demonstrate the remarkable ability of the proposed method in correct estimation of mode shapes of the linear structures based on rather accurate modal frequencies."

Based on culturally endorsed implicit leadership theory (CLT), we developed and empirically tested a two-by-two matrix model to identify differences in leadership effectiveness depending on the cultural context. Bass (1985) argued that transformational leadership (TFL) is built on a base of transactional leadership (TSL); therefore, a positive moderating effect may exist between these two leadership types. However, House (1996) challenged that argument by insisting that TSL has a negative moderating effect on employee outcome. In this study, we suggest that the moderating effect of TSL may differ depending on the culture. The results of our analysis of four groups classified according to the perceptions of subordinate workers (315 Korean and 181 U.S. employees) of TFL and TSL styles showed highest values for both OC and JS in the high-TFL and high-TSL groups in the Korean sample, while values for the high-TFL and low-TSL groups were highest for U.S. employees. To elucidate these findings further, we investigated the moderating effects of various subdimensions of TFL and TSL. The results indicated that TFL and TSL had positive moderating effects on OC and JS in Korea. However, no such moderating effect was evident in the U.S. sample. These results were consistent with the results of the two-by-two matrix. The findings of this study provide important insight into how managers can lead Korean and U.S. employees more successfully."

The measurement of battery impedance can be performed by the battery charger to provide an accurate equivalent model for battery management purposes. In this paper, an extended control capability of the onboard battery charger for electric vehicles is used to measure the online impedance of the battery. The impedance of the battery is measured by the following: 1) injecting ac current ripple on top of the dc charging current; 2) transforming voltage and current signals using a virtual α-β stationary coordinate system, a d-q rotating coordinate system, and two filtering systems; 3) calculating ripple voltage and current values; and 4) calculating the angle and magnitude of the impedance. The contributions of this paper are the use of the d-q transformation to attain the battery impedance, theta, and its ripple power, as well as providing a controller design procedure which has impedance measurement capability. The online impedance information can be utilized for diverse applications such as the following: 1) a theta control for sinusoidal current charging; 2) the quantifying of reactive current and voltage; 3) ascertaining the state of charge; 4) determining the state of health; and 5) finding the optimized charging current. Therefore, the benefit of this method is that it can be deployed in already existing high-power chargers regardless of battery chemistry.

a series arc fault detection strategy for single-phase boost pfc rectifiers,2015,"['Arc fault detection', 'Power factor correction', 'Series arc', 'UL1699']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This paper proposes a series arc fault detection algorithm which incorporates peak voltage and harmonic current detectors for single-phase boost power factor correction (PFC) rectifiers. The series arc fault model is also proposed to analyze the phenomenon of the arc fault and detection algorithm. For arc detection, the virtual dq transformation is utilized to detect the peak input voltage. In addition, multiple combinations of low- and high-pass filters are applied to extract the specific harmonic components which show the characteristics of the series arc fault conditions. The proposed model and the arc detection method are experimentally verified through a boost PFC rectifier prototype operating under the grid-tied condition with an artificial arc generator manufactured under the guidelines for the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 1699 standard."

CT is considered to improve performance of face recognition in a variety of illumination variations. (2D)2LDA is applied to transform high dimensional image into low-dimensional image which is used as input data to the proposed pattern classifier. Receptive fields in hidden layer are formed as interval type-2 membership function. We use the coefficients of linear polynomial function as the connection weights of the proposed networks, and the coefficients and their ensuing spreads are learned through Conjugate Gradient Method(CGM). Moreover, the parameters such as fuzzification coefficient and the number of input variables are optimized by Artificial Bee Colony(ABC). In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed classifier, Yale B dataset which consists of images obtained under diverse state of illumination environment is applied. We show that the results of the proposed model have much more superb performance and robust characteristic than those reported in the previous studies."

The play divides characters into two groups, namely ‘fine’ and ‘wild’ companies, and it places them in different floors of the inn. Relegated downstairs, the wild company ply their routine trade, representing realist popular culture. In contrast, aristocratic guests throw a French-style salon party, producing romantic ambience. Generally, Neoplatonist culture indicates French fashions regarding Platonic love which was practiced as pastimes in the courtly circle of the Caroline period. Originally, this French culture was cultivated at the salon of the Hôtel de Rambouillet in the early seventeenth century. In the play, the central scenes are occupied by the Court of Love in which the participants discuss love and valour. Their discussion is conducted in the form of dialogue modeled on Plato’s Symposium. Along with Plato, their thesis of Platonic love is influenced by the Florentine philosopher, Marsilio Ficino, who proposed Platonic love as a divine doctrine by combining Plato’s idealism with Christianity. With the progress of the Court of Love, however, the play transforms the thesis of Platonic love and registers the two protagonists’ psychological development towards romantic attachment to each other. In French salons, Platonic love was practiced as a didactic method for a coterie of admirers to refine their emotional investment through tension between the excitement and denial of love passion, which is orchestrated by an idealized woman. But the denouement of the play shows romantic consummation of love affairs between Lady Frampul and Lord Lovel, which has developed in the course of their role-playing in the Court of Love. In doing so, the play suggests the motif of theatrum mundi as its main concern of thematic development."

restructuring the discourses for a real multi-cultural society in south korea,2015,"['social capital', 'ethnicity', 'community', 'multiculturalism']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"South Korea is transforming into a multicultural society complicatedly and rapidly. But, the existing discourses have many limits to realizing a multicultural society because they are restricted to partial immigrants or lopsided toward the subjects like the government, multiculturalism, and human capital only. This study focuses on the possibility of a macroscopic discourse by introducing new ways of achieving a multicultural society, including international marriage migrant women (IMMW), foreign workers, and North Korean migrants. First, it suggests that the leading subject of the multicultural society should change from government to community. The multicultural society led by the government cannot help but have many problems and limitations because of depending mainly on social welfare. Second, it argues that the discussion level for a multicultural society must come down from abstract multiculturalism to concrete ethnicity to understand immigrants precisely. Third, it contends that the value of a multicultural society should be pursued not for human capital but for social capital. It is necessary to think of a multicultural society as helpful and profitable in respect of immigrants or in respect of both immigrants and natives. It is time to find a path to the multicultural society on the Korean model through macroscopic discourse."

The spottier RHEED has been observed with increased thickness of the InGaN as opposed to streakier behavior of AlGaN. We have noticed incremental nature of RMS roughness, skewness and kurtosis of InGaN surface compared to GaN or AlGaN from AFM as evident by final spotty RHEED for InGaN. However, the analyzed fractal dimension is lower for InGaN as opposed to AlGaN ( ). From the kinetic roughening perspective of adatoms, the experimental evidences lead to the high correlation between binding energy of the cluster atoms ( ) and the modified DDA growth model with dissociation and evaporation to confirm the efficacy of the study. The initial streaky and spotty RHEED of InGaN and AlGaN, respectively, can be attributed to their Eb that causes smoothing and roughening of the GaN surface due to adatoms surface mobility behavior. Therefore, the fractal description reveals the fact during formation of nitride hetero-interface while other AFM results describe the top surface."

The LST along the Dhanushkodi coast is studied based on data collected simultaneously in Gulf of Mannar (GoM) and Palk Bay (PB) using directional waverider buoys. The numerical model REF/DIF1 was used to calculate the nearshore waves and the LST rate was estimated using three different formulae. The model validation was done based on the measured nearshore waves using InterOcean S4DW. Numerical model LITPACK was also used for simulating non-cohesive sediment transport and the LITLINE module was used to study the shoreline evolution over 5 years. Low net annual LST along PB (~ 0.01×106 m3) compared to the GoM region (0.3×106 m3) were due to the weak waves. Accretion in the region led to growth of the Dhanushkodi sandspit by 65 m during the period 2010-2015.

According to the periodic and non-periodic characteristics of service resources demand, MPRA first adopts FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) to judge the periodic characteristics. For resource allocation without periodic characteristics, it uses Markov process to predict, and obtains the higher resource utilization and prediction accuracy, thus, to ensure the user experience. The experimental results show that MPRA can accurately predict the change trend of service resource requirements, and then can allocate the virtual machine resources self-adaptively according to the prediction results. Obviously, it has improved the virtual machine resources utilization, reduced the occupation number of physical machines and effectively reduced the violation times in SLA (Service-level Agreement)."

a simplified approach to assessment of mission success for helicopter landing on a ship,2015,"['Dynamic interface', 'helicopter landing', 'pilot control model', 'ship motion', 'workload rating']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, operation of a helicopter near a ship is statistically investigated to provide an estimate of the probability of successfully recovering manned rotorcraft on the deck of a moving ship.To this end, pitch, roll, and heave motion of the ship are calculated according to sea states. In addition, effect on dynamics of the rotorcraft from ship airwake is also considered in a simplified way. By assuming that a helicopter can land on a ship if a pilot maintains relative position and attitude difference within the safe boundary for a given time, the operational limits are probabilistically determined in terms of pilot’s workload for a specified mission. The simulation environment consists of linearized helicopter dynamics, an optimal pilot model, effect of turbulent ship airwake, and ship motion. Control activities of the piloted helicopter for position holding with respect to the moving ship are transformed to generalized workload ratings. Simulation results show the proposed approach can evaluate and predict mission success rates for various operational combinations, allowing implementation into the overall effectiveness assessment of the ship and ship-helicopter combination."

That kind of isomorphism is well-known only for D-FlipFlop synchronous circuit, and our isomorphism is its generalization since comprehensive latches include D-FlipFlops. The key idea of our isomorphism is that a state machine is synchronized by a natural transformation (categorical term) in an analogous way of that circuit is synchronized by a synchronous element. D-Latches are also elements of our comprehensive latches, and thus, for a given D-Latch synchronous circuit, the isomorphism provides a state machine correspond to the circuit."
improvement in accuracy of isar image formation using the shooting and bouncing ray,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Since the introduction of a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based convolution scheme between an impulse train and a ray spread function for the inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) image formation using shooting and bouncing ray (SBR), remarkable progress has been made in reducing calculation time. However, because of an interpolation algorithm, which is essential to the FFT process, it necessarily causes the distortion of image. The present work is an attempt to generate an accurate image without loss of calculation time efficiency. Specifically, by removing dominant interpolation error contribution from the prior ray spread function, the distortion is prevented without the use of the time-consuming higher-order interpolation or high oversampling. The proposed scheme is simulated for several 3-D CAD models and demonstrated by comparing the image using the proposed and existing scheme under the same conditions.</P>"

As the size of buildings is becoming massive, the need for structural health monitoring (SHM) technique is increasing. Various SHM techniques have been studied for buildings which have different dynamic characteristics and influenced by various external loads. “Abnormal behavior point” is a moment when the structure starts vibrating abnormally and this can be detected by comparing between before and after abnormal behavior point. In other words, anomalous behavior is a sign of damage on structures and estimating the abnormal behavior point can be directly related to the safety of structure. Abnormal behavior causes damage on structures and this leads to enormous economic damage as well as damage for humans. This study proposes an estimating technique to find abnormal behavior point using Hilber-Huang Transform which is a time-frequency signal analysis technique and the proposed algorithm has been examined through laboratory tests with a bridge model using a shaking table."
a discussion on paik nak-chung’s division system theory,2015,"['The World System', 'Theory of Double Mission', 'Transformative Centrism', 'Citizen Participation Model of Unification', 'Wisdom Theory']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Since the 1980s, Paik Nak-Chung’s division system theory has broadened the horizons of Korean humanities by constantly reflecting upon Korean social movements. Paik argues that divided Korea is not merely a part of the Cold War but of the capitalist world system in the sense that it is dominated by US imperialism in a more unilateral fashion than other divided countries such as East and West Germany wherein the contradiction between the two Camps was merely reproduced. In order to overcome the division system of Korea, he proposes strategies with concrete and practical directions and methods, such as transformative centrism, a citizen participation model of unification. These strategies are in turn associated with his unique philosophical scholarship on a double mission of adapting to and overcoming modernity and on oriental wisdom. However, he fails to provide a detailed analysis of the mutual hostility, mistrust, and fear of the people of South and North Korea. In order to dismantle the division system of Korea, there is a need to examine the characteristics and mechanisms of the people’s cognitive-practical barriers to reunification, and such are embodied in their values, emotions, and living cultures.."
fashion is “me too” style is “only me”: consumer preferences towards fast fashion and luxury fashion,2015,"['luxury fashion', 'fashion industry', 'CNFU', 'Fashion-brand attitude', 'fashion consumer']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The fashion industry has been dramatically transformed during the last 20 years with the introduction of fast fashion: a style of instant cutting edge fashion at affordable prices (Sheridan, Moore, & Nobbs, 2006). The term, fast fashion, describes a business model characterized by rapid supply chains, merchandising techniques and retail technology all developed to respond to increasingly fast changing consumer demands (Kim, Choo, & Yoon, 2013). In contrast to this business format, luxury fashion brands have always held a superior position in the fashion industry through their quality, limited release and pricing policies. The contemporary fashion industry is now highly competitive, with this additional pressure coming from fast fashion companies constantly delivering original and “fresh” products at affordable prices (Cholachatpinyo, Fletcher, Padgett, & Crocker, 2002). Despite the apparent price discrepancy between fast fashion and luxury fashion products, both these two fashion styles appear to cater to a consumer’s need for uniqueness. Through the consumption of fashion this uniqueness factor becomes evident in the way in which consumers convey their individual identity and self-image to society. Intuitively, as the two styles of fashion are distinctive, the type of uniqueness component desired by their consumer will differ. Therefore, we ask: “what aspects of uniqueness are motivating consumers to choose between fast fashion and luxury fashion brands?” The paper answers this important research question through evaluating (1) the predictively of fashion-brand attitude and self-congruency on fashion style preferences and (2) the moderating role of consumers’ need for uniqueness (CNFU) in these direct relationships.An online survey of 301 U.S. participants was conducted utilizing a quazi-experimental between-subjects design. All participants had experience with purchasing either fast fashion or luxury fashion clothing. Fashion-brand attitude and self-image congruency were treated as independent variable with preference for fashion style as the dependent variable. The three factors that constitute CNFU were treated as moderators. The results suggest that fashion style preference is determined more by the level of self-image congruency than positive attitudes towards fashion brands. More importantly, the different qualities of CNFU are capable of influencing individual consumers’ fashion preference within each fashion style. Collectively, the findings present strong supporting evidence that the differences in consumers’ need for uniqueness are likely to affect some fashion style preferences and not others. In particular, the majority of findings are consistent with the central argument that fashion consumers are uniqueness seekers and have their own ways of portraying their individuality to society (Workman & Caldwell, 2007). There was however inconsistent results obtained by treating CNFU as a single moderating construct, thus adding further support for Tain, Bearden and Hunter’s (2001) proposition that the consumers need for uniqueness consists of three distinct components, each specifying a unique personality trait."
computed tomographic beam-hardening artefacts: mathematical characterization and analysis,2015,"['computerized tomography', 'beam-hardening artefacts', 'Radon transform', 'wavefront set']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>This paper presents a mathematical characterization and analysis of beam-hardening artefacts in X-ray computed tomography (CT). In the field of dental and medical radiography, metal artefact reduction in CT is becoming increasingly important as artificial prostheses and metallic implants become more widespread in ageing populations. Metal artefacts are mainly caused by the beam-hardening of polychromatic X-ray photon beams, which causes mismatch between the actual sinogram data and the data model being the Radon transform of the unknown attenuation distribution in the CT reconstruction algorithm. We investigate the beam-hardening factor through a mathematical analysis of the discrepancy between the data and the Radon transform of the attenuation distribution at a fixed energy level. Separation of cupping artefacts from beam-hardening artefacts allows causes and effects of streaking artefacts to be analysed. Various computer simulations and experiments are performed to support our mathematical analysis.</P>"

This paper focuses on the key features of the HEVC standard. Then it analyzes the complexity of the HEVC standard by profiling the HEVC reference software HM12.0 which is released by JCT-VC community with Intel Core i7 processor. The experiment covers different settings for a wide variety of video sequences, with the resolutions ranging from 240p to 1600p. The evaluation result shows that the HEVC standard can achieve a doubling in coding efficiency at the cost of increasing the complexity slightly. When the sequences are coded in all-intra or random-access configurations, intra prediction, loop filter, inverse transform and motion compensation are the most complex components for HEVC decoder. The motion compensation part should be given lots of consideration since it can take nearly half of the decoding time. The quantization parameter (QP) also has obvious influences on the complexity of the decoder. Besides, in practice, the HM decoder is not able to decode video content with 1080p or higher resolutions for real-time applications."

According to this point, we propose a mixed-prediction based resource allocation approach in this paper, which is abbreviated as MPRA. This proposed MPRA employs FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) theory to determine the cyclical attribution. If there is no such attribution existed, the Markov chain is alternatively used to predict the tendency of resource requirement. The experimental results show that the proposed MPRA could predict the future resource requirement more precisely. Moreover, based on the prediction result, it could also allocate the virtual machine resource adaptively, decrease the number of occupied physical machines, and reduce the probability of violating the SLA (Service-level Agreement)."

The goal of this paper is to provide a network theoretic explanation of the different paths of Asia and Europe during the postwar period. First, we propose a punctuatedequilibrium model of network diffusion that emphasizes the uncertain nature of diffusion dynamics. Then, we argue that successful regional integration hinges crucially on factors that assure critical mass of countries to embark on a venture of regional integration without fear of exploitation or noncompliance by regional powers in the future. In that regard, we compare the Sino-Japanese relationship in Asia with the Franco-German relationship in Europe, which we call the inter-core relationship, in shaping different paths of regional network diffusion within the two regions. While France and Germany have jointly played pivotal roles in shaping the path to European integration, China and Japan have acted like “two tigers” in the same mountain and missing important opportunities in the 1970s to transform their bilateral relationship. Utilizing the World Treaty Index data set and the community detection method, we found that distinct inter-core relationships in Europe and Asia indeed led to different patterns of evolution in the community structure of bilateral economic networks between Asian and European countries during the postwar period."

The results suggest that Korean labor forces are bi-directionally migrated to China and Japan, simultaneously, and Chinese labor forces have been switched from inflow to outflow. On the other hand, Japanese labor markets are characterized by inflow from Korea, and outflow to China. The nature of labor markets in Northeast Asia have been largely transformed such that inflow of immigrants is gradually intimidated. This is mainly due to the fact that the labor markets are gradually homogenized in this region. To this end, it could be tentatively concluded that the labor markets in Northeast Asia seem to be operated by substitutionary rather than complementary natures."

From the analysis of the HHT, we further found the distribution of the lifetimes for the intermittent oscillations and the distribution for the time intervals with no significant signal (the break time). The mean lifetime is 1.45 s and 90% of the oscillation segments have lifetimes less than 3.1 s whereas the mean break time is 0.42 s and 90% of break times are less than 0.73 s.

The participants were composed of nine long-term vippassnā-meditators(male: 6, female: 3) with the ages ranging from forties to fifties. The interviews were put into written words and the words were described, analyzed, and interpreted using a phenomenological research method developed by Giorgi. Then, the categories are structured according to the stages of meditation: seeking of meditation, acquirement of meditation, and meditation mastery. Attitude toward life, changes in thinking, emotion, and behavior, and triggering factors of the changes were identified for each stage. The key findings in relation with self-transformation were as follows. First, during the process of seeking the meditation, personal problems, dysfunctional actions, and unstable emotions can be seen as the major reasons for pursuing the meditation. Second, as a result of perseverant meditations, there were several themes about self-transformation: a renewed understanding of one's personal problems, the discernment of one's unstable emotion, the change of attitude toward one's life, and the inducing factors which are mindfulness, repeated awareness of afflictions, vippassanā wisdom, and awareness of one's life from an objective and contextual angle through self-reflection. Third, after long-term meditations, the participants reported that new concepts about self, good and evil, pain, and death were obtained. These results in the achievement of stable emotion leading to tranquility, the change of attitude and behavior from egoism to altruism, and the inducing factors which are mindfulness and awareness to observe one's own body and mind in one's ordinary life, cognitive de-fusion as a thought on the highest level of mental function, self-reflection, self-acceptance, and a long term meditation. Implications of these findings in terms of development of Korean indigenous counseling model were discussed. In addition, limitations and suggestions were presented."

Nine modeling teams participated in the project to explore the consequences of global emissions following the proposed policy stringency of the national pledges from the Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements to 2030. Specific features compared to earlier assessments are the explicit consideration of near-term 2030 emission targets as well as the systematic sensitivity analysis for the availability and potential of mitigation technologies. Our estimates show that a 2030 mitigation effort comparable to the pledges would result in a further ''lock-in'' of the energy system into fossil fuels and thus impede the required energy transformation to reach low greenhouse-gas stabilization levels (450ppm CO<SUB>2</SUB>e). Major implications include significant increases in mitigation costs, increased risk that low stabilization targets become unattainable, and reduced chances of staying below the proposed temperature change target of 2<SUP>o</SUP>C in case of overshoot. With respect to technologies, we find that following the pledge pathways to 2030 would narrow policy choices, and increases the risks that some currently optional technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) or the large-scale deployment of bioenergy, will become ''a must'' by 2030."

Furthermore, the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) methodology is commonly used to mitigate the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) occurred over a wireless channel. However, the OFDM suffers from certain drawbacks including higher system complexity due to the generation of the peak to average ratio (PAPR). The objective of this study is to reduce the high PAPR resulted from adapting the OFDM system to vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose a novel precoding Zadoff-Chu Sequence (ZCS) combined with the Clipping technique for PAPR reduction in OFDM based on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).

Analytical equations have been derived to obtain the transformation in fluid properties. The results thus obtained are discussed for different conditions of overspray and initial absolute humidity of the air inside the cylinder. The thermodynamic curves obtained are seen to deviate significantly from the dry isentropic curve ( PVγ=constant) with decreasing droplet diameters and increasing mass of droplets.

In this approach, the three highfrequency coefficients in wavelet domain of medical image are pre-processed. This pre-processing strategy can reduce the redundant ratio of big-data medical image. Firstly, the high-frequency coefficients are transformed to the spherical coordinate domain to reduce the correlation in the same scale. Then, a multi-scale model product (MSMP) is used to control the shrinkage function so as to make the small wavelet coefficients and some noise removed.

Different aspects of Ninomiya’s thoughts were emphasized in each period. During the course of this paper each aspect of them has been closely examined. Ninomiya’s ideology is often referred to as ‘Houtoku Sisou’ ― the repaying virtue. His ideologies were fundamentally derived from his work on rural rehabilitation and the reconstruction of Bakufu finance. Its foundations are also strongly set in the ideals of making the country prosperous and keeping its people at peace. It regarded the welfare of peasants higher than the attitude of the lord or Bakufu. In the Meiji period, however, the ideology of Ninomiya’s ‘Houtoku’ was transformed into a principle for edifying the nation. It was utilized to generate national wealth and enhance national prosperity. Its aims were to strengthen military power and implement the policies of the imperial system. Later in the Shouwa period the spirit of ‘Houtoku,’ regarded as the same as ‘Japanese spirit,’ was transformed into a belief of loyalty. This encouraged labor mobilization for wars and the devotion of one’s life to the emperor. Making Ninomiya into an ideal figure before the defeat of the World War Ⅱ can be seen as a way of maintaining the regime of Emperor and consolidating imperialism. As described above Ninomiya, as considered the ‘ideal’ person was utilized for indoctrinating of the Japanese empire and as the banner of militarism in the modern Japanese era. It was possible that the characteristics of his thought were based on the ideology of revering the empire and Shintouism. After the defeat of WWⅡ, Ninomiya was idealized into the figure of democracy. This was the outcome of GHQ/SCAP reforming Ninomiya``s ideology to coincide with its democratic policy. It was a recreation of an image that combined the political ideological image of the modern Japan era and democratic image of the contemporary era. In conclusion the biggest reason for transforming Ninomya’s ideology and making him a banner for conflicting political beliefs is that his ideas coincided with each period’ goals. In their desire to manage the country, they prioritized the expansion of national economy and the maintenance of social order. It is well represented that his ideologies were not antiestablishment, valued ``labor`` above everything else and emphasized the returning of wealth accumulated from work and savings to the society. Since his ideology was based on actual life and was practical enough to be used as moral virtues for the whole nation regardless of gender, age or class, it became the obvious route to unite and control public spirit."

The larger size of the compensation error from the spine and ribs plot using the radioactive decay equation indicates that there are no benefits in using this equation in standoff compensation. Based on these results, we propose a reverse transform spine and ribs technique by essentially combining the conventional spine and ribs technique and the spine and ribs technique in terms of apparent density."

The nonuniformityof the flow velocity distribution caused by the viscosity of fluid and the small-size effects on the flow field was considered.Euler-Bernoulli beam model was used to investigate flow-induced vibration of the nanotube, while the non-uniformity of the flow velocityand the small-size effects of the flow field were formulated through Knudsen number (Kn), as a discriminant parameter. For laminarflow in a circular nanotube, the momentum correction factor was developed as a function of Kn. For Kn = 0 (continuum flow), the momentumcorrection factor was found to be 1.33, which decreases by the increase in Kn may even reach near 1 for the transition flow regime.We observed that for passage of viscous flow through a nanotube with the non-uniform flow velocity, the critical continuum flowvelocity for divergence decreased considerably as opposed to those for the uniform flow velocity, while by increasing Kn, the differencebetween the uniform and non-uniform flow models may be reduced. In the solution part, the differential transformation method (DTM)was used to solve the governing differential equations of motion."

The cognitive apprenticeship was found to transform the learning disabled from the passive and marginal learners to the active and full-fledged participants in learning. Their school-life also grew more active through the positive friendship developed among classmates. Some general stages of development were detected in their growing participation in learning: the initial stage of interest in learning was followed by the stage of skills and contents dependency, of skills independence and contents dependence, and finally of skills and contents independence. The stage development, in addition, appeared partly to be associated with three factors: the external factors of apprenticeship learning environments, the internal factors of a sense of achievement, self-confidence, and willingness to participation, and their interactive factors. It seems that some understanding of stages and factors may be required for the successful implementation of apprenticeship model for the learning disabled."

The purpose that the author tries the approach through the above methodology is to introduce the beginning to apply Buddhist paradigm to contemporary psychology as one of integration of academic disciplines. This paper introduces briefly the recent research on Buddhist Meditation, and then compares and reviews the structures between Eight Consciousnesses, based on alayavijnana which is called the eighth consciousness, and the relationship of consciousness and unconsciousness in Jungian psychology. This study discusses the theoretical structures of Three Natures (trisvabhava) and ‘Revolution’ or inner transformation of the Basis (asrayaparavrtti) in Yogacara’s doctrine in order to analyze the causes of existential painfulness and to suggest the possibilities leading to its therapy. From comparing Yogacara doctrine and Jungian analytical psychology, the following two conclusive points can be made. First, Buddhist meditation through the nature of existence produced from attachment to illusory discrimination (parikalpita-svabhava) in the doctrine of the three natures of cognition considers as one model for psychotherapy to cope with the problems caused from phenomenal painfulness. Second, Buddhist meditation using the nature of existence being perfectly accomplished (parinispanna- svabhava), that is to say, the effort based on the nature of existence arising from causes and conditions (paratantra-svabhava) in the doctrine of the three natures of cognition provides a method for philosophical psychotherapy in terms of individualization and self-realization in the process of Buddhist practice."

Factors at the teacher-individual level include demographic and social-psychological factors. Factors at the school-organizational level include ecological-environmental and structural-cultural factors.Findings/Results: The major findings are as follows: teachers’ job satisfaction levels are different among schools. Among demographic factors, whether or not teachers are in-charge of their classes, as well as whether or not they play a director’s role has an impact on their job satisfaction levels. Among social-psychological factors, factors that increased teachers’ job satisfaction included: organizational culture, their principal’s transformational leadership, and teachers’ awareness of the Seoul municipal government’s educational strategy. On the contrary, factors that decreased teachers’ job satisfaction levels were teaching creativity, a closed school environment, and a principal’s transactional leadership. Among ecological- environmental factors, the number of classes and students helps to explain teachers’ job satisfaction level; teachers with more classes, but less students show higher job satisfaction levels. And finally, there are no factors that have an impact on teachers’ job satisfaction level among the structural-cultural factors at the school-organizational level.Value: These findings provide suggestions for the development of education policies to improve teacher’s job satisfaction levels."

In this article, Hur explores how the vanguard monks were connected with progressive political activists, how both groups pursued visions of modern transformation from the model of Meiji Japan, and what implications their activism (which heavily relied upon the nexus of Honganji Buddhism) brought upon the course of Buddhist transformation at the dawn of modern Korea. As it turned out, the Honganji connection cost the scope of the reform vision of both progressive activists and vanguard monks by inducing them into the “enlightenment” cradle of a modern Japan as spearheaded much by the Ch?sh? faction, a big supporter of Honganji Buddhism. Compared to Meiji Japans political leaders and Buddhist activists, the perceptual horizon of Koreas progressive activists and vanguard monks was hamstrung by the channel through which they were exposed to the outside world. As a result, from the outset, the progressive Buddhist activism in Chos?n Korea was destined to suffer from geopolitical parochialism."
overlapping frame approach to estimate and reduce noise from single channel speech,2015,"['Log Likelihood ratio (LLR)', 'weighted spectral slope (WSS)', 'non stationary', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'speech enhancement']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Speech enhancement is a long standing problem with various applications like telephone conversation and speech recognition. The corruption of speech due to presence of additive background noise causes severe difficulties in various communication environments. If the background noise is evolving more slowly than the speech, then the estimation of the noise during speech pauses is easier as compared to non stationary noise. If in case the Noise is varying rapidly then estimation is more difficult. This paper focuses on the class of single-channel noise reduction methods that are performed with frequency domain using short-time Fourier Transform (STFT). There are number of publications and implementations on noise reduction systems. But, there are still some issues in non- stationary noisy systems. This single-channel approach is more dominant and effective approach for practical systems. From last few years, algorithms have been proposed for this problem but most of them are worked on noisy signal in current frame. So in this paper we are trying to propose the new model using Wiener filter by using the concept of multi-frame approach with different window sizes and overlaps. The proposed method shows the results with its superiority."

The job attitude of KORAIL members is an important index to understand and predict an individual behavior in the organization. Furthermore, since the job attitude of its members may affect various performance variables of the organization in the respect of management, it shall be verified and managed.The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the effects of resilence on job satisfaction and organizational commitment. To conduct such examination, the author (i) designated resilence, job satisfaction and organizational commitment as variables and (ii) designed a research model and set up hypotheses by conducting preceding studies on the variables. To examine the hypotheses, the author conducted a survey on members of Gyeongbuk Headquarters of KORAIL and analyzed the survey based on collected 436 copies of questionnaire. Collected data were analyzed using SPSS and AMOS programs, and covariance analysis was conducted to verify the fitness of the study model and the hypotheses.The analysis results are as follows. First, there was a statistically significant relationship between the resilience of the organization members and job satisfaction, organizational commitment. And then the relevant hypothesis was adopted. Second, job satisfaction have been found to be positive effect on organizational commitment.The implications which this study are as follows. First, this study has discovered that resilience had positive effect on job satisfaction, organizational commitment. This result confirms that resilience is the important variables that affect organizational effectiveness. Second, a higher resilience was associated with a higher organizational commitment, offering practical significance in extrapolating the relationship between the positive psychological capital variables held by the individual. In terms of practical implications, first, as organizational confidence is low and conflict between management and labor is severe at KORAIL, there is a need to pay more attention to the positive psychological capital variable of organizational members such as resilience and organizational commitment. Second, the stress levels of organizational members who are swamped with constant measures for management innovation and reduction of the workforce is very high. Given this situation, various training programs and measures that can improve resilience to overcome challenges and stress would be needed and the findings of this study could be used as a rationale for such arguments.This study also has the following limitations: first, this study was conducted based on cross-sectional design of research. It is considered that the objectivity of study results shall be improved in future with interview investigation for major sample groups in order to supplement the weakness of questionnaire survey methods. Second, it is difficult to generalize the results of this study, in that the survey was conducted mainly for members of KORAIL Gyeongbuk headquarters. Thus, the results of this study shall be carefully construed. Third, the measurement scales have their own limitations.

Previous method is based on the focus measures which are calculated for a series of image by a single camera at different distance between and object. This method, however, has disadvantage of taking a long time for calculating the focus measure since the mask operation is performed for every pixel in the image. In this paper, we estimates the depth by using the focus measure of the boundary pixels located between the objects in order to minimize the depth estimate time. To detect the boundary of an object consisting of a straight line and a circle, we use the Hough transform and estimate the depth by using the focus measure. We performed various experiments for PCB images and obtained more effective depth estimation results than previous ones."
efficient certificate-based proxy re-encryption scheme fordata sharing in public clouds,2015,"['Public cloud storage', 'encrypted data sharing', 'certificate-based proxy re-encryption', 'random oracle model', 'chosen-ciphertext security']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Nowadays, public cloud storage is gaining popularity and a growing number of users are beginning to use the public cloud storage for online data storing and sharing. However, how the encrypted data stored in public clouds can be effectively shared becomes a new challenge. Proxy re-encryption is a public-key primitive that can delegate the decryption right from one user to another. In a proxy re-encryption system, a semi-trusted proxy authorized by a data owner is allowed to transform an encrypted data under the data owner`s public key into a re-encrypted data under an authorized recipient`s public key without seeing the underlying plaintext. Hence, the paradigm of proxy re-encryption provides a promising solution to effectively share encrypted data. In this paper, we propose a new certificate-based proxy re-encryption scheme for encrypted data sharing in public clouds. In the random oracle model, we formally prove that the proposed scheme achieves chosen-ciphertext security. The simulation results show that it is more efficient than the previous certificate-based proxy re-encryption schemes."

This paper discusses the transformation of urban form and architecture in Seoul in the 1980s brought on by the emergence of Housing Site Development(HSD), the last major urban planning tool introduced in Korea. Using Mok-dong in Seoul as a model, since it is the first development project based solely on HSD principles, this paper first reviews the socio-political back-ground and characteristics of the HSD project. Second, the macro-spatial structure and micro-urban fabric of Mok-dong are analyzed and compared with an adjacent area con-structed under the previous major urban planning tool—Land Readjustment(LR). This analysis combines an understanding of the programmatic architectural requirements with an awareness of the external urban circumstances in Seoul in order to arrive at a clearer un-derstanding of the character of Seoul’s urban architecture. While the Mok-dong plan was based on the winning scheme from a public design competition, the detailed land use plan and land subdivision plan saw significant divergence from the original scheme as a result of economic changes and market demand in the city. The geometric qualities of the land ‘grid’ found in LR development projects disappeared in the HSD layout of the apartment complex(danji), while the grid patterned blocks and plots in the business and commercial districts were significantly augmented. The increase in scale of the urban components yielded larger and higher building typologies. Consequently, the medium-rise buildings in the more compact LR areas of adjacent Sinjeong-4-dong stand in sharp contrast to—and perhaps even in the shadows of—the high-rise apartments and the business and commer-cial towers at Mok-dong. There, the relationship of the buildings to street orientation is linked to the divergence of ‘thin’ and ‘thick’ building plans, where narrowing and elongat-ing was favored in the apartment buildings, while squaring or ‘thickening’ was preferred for the commercial buildings. These morphological findings may not point directly to an alternative conceptualization of urban architecture, but they could be the foundation on which to build a theory about Seoul’s architecture and urbanism as it relates to the lived identity of the city."

Thermal characteristics and structural transformations of the BTLBZO glass, formed through precursors of Li2B4O7, ZnO, and BaTiO3, have been studied by means of differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. It is found that crystallization of glass accompanies a sequential two-step occurrence of rhombohedral ZnTiO3 and orthorhombic Ba3Zn7Ti12O34 structures. We use the non-isothermal models of the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov, Kissinger, and Ozawa equations to characterize the kinetics of the crystallization process from the BTLBZO glass. The Avrami exponents of 3.5 and 2.5, for the first and second crystallization on heating the glass, indicate that the crystallization mechanisms belong to increasing and constant nucleation rates, respectively, with the diffusion-controlled growth. The activation energies of crystallization, obtained from those non-isothermal three models, show similar values to each other, ensuring the validity of applying equations to the non-isothermal analysis of crystallization kinetics from glass. Isoconversional analysis shows that there involves a complex mechanism at the late stage of crystallization.</P>"

They are ①Knowledge value adder ②Network learner ③Idea herb ④Idea creator ⑤Vision leader ⑥Vision follower. Finally, I conducted hierarchial linear analysis where independent variables are leadership and expertise. The key conclusions are listed below. Firstly, it turned out that six-roles of key players were highly affected by team-level. In particular, the key players of creative idea network turned out to be most greatly affected by team-level. Secondly, the knowledge value adder and idea herb’s roles were better explained by expertise than leadership while the other key players’ roles were better explained by leadership. Thirdly, ‘team leader’, ‘transformational leadership’, and ‘the number of years of their job’ are significant variables. This study provides the basis for multidimensional views the roles of team learning key players in terms of relationship and their influential factors.

areca nut exposure increases secretion of tumor‐promoting cytokines in gingival fibroblasts that trigger dna damage in oral keratinocytes,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<▼1><P>Molecular crosstalk between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been an emerging hot issue in understanding carcinogenesis. As oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is an inflammatory fibrotic disease that can potentially transform into squamous cell carcinoma, OSF has been considered to be an appropriate model for studying the role of fibroblasts during early stage carcinogenesis. In this sense, this study aims at investigating whether areca nut (AN)‐exposed fibroblasts cause DNA damage of epithelial cells. For this study, immortalized hNOF (hTERT‐hNOF) was used. We found that the levels of GRO‐α, IL‐6 and IL‐8 increased in AN‐exposed fibroblasts. Cytokine secretion was reduced by antioxidants in AN‐exposed fibroblasts. Increase in DNA double strand breaks (DSB) and 8‐oxoG FITC‐conjugate was observed in immortalized human oral keratinocytes (IHOK) after the treatment of cytokines or a conditioned medium derived from AN‐exposed fibroblasts. Cytokine expression and DNA damage were also detected in OSF tissues. The DNA damage was reduced by neutralizing cytokines or antioxidant treatment. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage response, triggered by cytokines, were abolished when NADPH oxidase (NOX) 1 and 4 were silenced in IHOK, indicating that cytokine‐triggered DNA damage was caused by ROS generation through NOX1 and NOX4. Taken together, this study provided strong evidence that blocking ROS generation might be a rewarding approach for cancer prevention and intervention in OSF.</P></▼1><▼2><P><B>What's new?</B></P><P>Fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment influence tumor initiation and growth and are of particular interest in oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), a progressive fibrotic disease of malignant potential.

In particular, the feminist perspective is viewed as a theoretical asset which encompasses not only gender equality but also child well-being. In Korean society, two choices are available in terms of how we see the increase in women's economic participation. These choices involve either maintaining the modern childcare paradigm or shifting to a new post-modern paradigm. The Korean government is delaying a shift to the post-modern paradigm despite the evidence of the dismantling of the modern gender order. However, for the sake of both gender equality and child's well-being, Korean society needs to shift to the post-modern paradigm. This study also presents a new social consensus of 'child centeredness' that can form the basis of the post-modern childcare paradigm while replacing the modern patriarchal conventional wisdom of gendered division of labor based on three characteristics such as child's perspective, recognition of children as citizens, the 'here and now' perspective that values childhood itself rather than seeing it as a preparatory period."
removal of co(ii) from aqueous solutions by sulfonated magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes,2015,"['Co(II)', 'Sorption', 'Sulfonated Magnetic Multi-walled Carbon Nnanotubes']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Sulfonated magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SMMWCNTs) were applied in the sorption of Co(II) from aqueous solutions. The SMMWCNTs were prepared and characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) test. A large number of influencing factors to the sorption process were investigated, such as pH, ionic strength, contact time, cations, anions, humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA) and temperature. The results indicated that the Co(II) sorption was strongly controlled by the pH and ionic strength. Moreover, foreign anions, such as F−, Cl− and Br−, had an obvious effect on the sorption process, which depended on the electronegativity of the anions. On the other hand, cations restrained sorption strongly, such as Mg2+ and Ca2+. The existence of HA/FA enhanced sorption process at pH<8 while weakened at pH>8. As revealed by the sorption results, the Langmuir adsorption model was more favorable than the Freundlich adsorption model, and the pseudo-second-order model could fit the data much better than the pseudo-first-order. The thermodynamic analysis suggested that sorption was spontaneous and endothermic. What’s more, the stability experiments of the SMMWCNTs showed that SMMWCNTs could maintain excellent magnetic stability and dispersion stability. Thus, this SMMWCNTs sorbent was believed to be a promising material for the selective removal of Co(II) from heavy metal-containing wastewater."

Accordingly, a growing number of empirical works support the positive impact of industrial clusters on firm innovation or performance mainly by investigating differences in innovation and performance between clustering and non-clustering firms. These works have mainly focused on figuring out exogenous factors of clusters, such as infrastructural resources, labor pools, and local endowments, originating externally. However, the success of clustering firms also depends on endogenous factors including formal economic transactions and social interactions for the exchange of knowledge and information among members within industrial clusters. Although previous study has argued that firms are able to benefit from the knowledge spillover of the clusters, referring to learning regions, it is unreasonable to simply assume that positioning in the clusters would lead to active knowledge exchange among cluster members. In this context, organizational leaning is regarded as an effective instrument allowing firms to acquire, exploit, and refine external knowledge contributing to business performance. Despite the importance of organizational learning in clustering firms, our understanding of which learning initiatives are needed for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to take advantage of the spillover effect of industrial clusters has fallen short of practical and research demands. The primary purpose of this study is to empirically examine the possible linkages among industrial cluster involvement, organizational learning capability, and firm performance of clustering SMEs. Starting from reviewing the literature and its limitations, we propose research hypotheses as two fold: (1) clustering SMEs possessing high levels of industrial cluster involvement and organizational learning capability would produce better performance in business than those who do not, and (2) clustering firms’ capability for organizational learning would play a pathway linking between their involvement in industrial cluster and performance. In a sample of 258 SMEs within industrial clusters in Korea, we tested the structured research model consisting of traded and untraded interdependences for industrial cluster involvement, absorptive and transformative capability for organizational learning capability, and firm performance through hierarchical regression analysis. The results revealed that traded and untraded interdependences, the two constructs of industrial cluster involvement had positive effect on firm performance. The positive linkage of organizational learning capability, represented by absorptive and transformative capability, with firm performance was also confirmed. It was notable that organizational learning capability mediated fully the positive linkage between firms’ involvement in industrial clusters and performance. The primary contribution of this study is its attempt to provide a comprehensive approach in analyzing SMEs’ industrial cluster involvement in terms of their traded and untraded interdependences. Moreover, this study expands upon the importance of enhancing organizational learning and relevant capabilities from the perspective of clustering SMEs. Detailed implication and contribution of this study are discussed in the conclusions."

Software-generated ANOVA results confirmed the sufficiency of model equations. Results pre-dicted by model equations are in good agreement with that of experimental results. Optimized formulation with vari-ables ‘CV: HPβCD: TA-kneading time’ (200mg: 689.6mg: 227.6mg-45min) showed complete drug release (~99%)within 15min and enhanced solubility of 1.89mg/mL. The instrumental analysis (DSC, XRD& FTIR) of the opti-mized solid dispersion suggests a transformation of crystallinity of drug to amorphous form, due to its complexationwith HPβCD. Hence, this combination of drug and carriers suggests an improvement of carvedilol bioavailability."

For SCC, which is increasingly used these days, HEVC SCC standardization has been proceeded. Technologies such as intra block copy (IBC), palette coding, and adaptive color transform are developed and adopted to the HEVC SCC standard. This paper examines IBC and palette coding that significantly impacts RD performance of SCC for screen content. The HEVC SCC reference model (SCM) 4.0 was used to comparatively analyze the coding performance of HEVC SCC based on the HEVC range extension (RExt) model for screen content."
<폴링 다운>과 <그랜 토리노>에 나타난 탈냉전과 교외/거주공간의 재해석,2015,"['Falling Down', 'Gran Torino', 'post-Cold War', 'suburbs', 'white masculinity', '<폴링 다운>', '<그랜 토리노>', '탈냉전', '교외', '백인 남성성']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"This essay attempts to examine the ways in which Joel Schumacher’s Falling Down (1993) and Clint Eastwood’s Gran Torino (2008) reconsider American ways of family life glorified in the early Cold War years, especially the lifestyle most often associated with “sitcom suburbs” idealized as the model living space of white middle-class family. White male protagonists of each film, now living in the uncertain era of post-Cold War that they believe is plagued by lawlessness and multicultural invasion of the American way of life, struggle to maintain conservative values about national identity, gender, race, and family life formulated in their younger years at the height of the Cold War. In his violent and elegiac journey across various sub/urban localities in and around Los Angeles, Falling Down’s D-Fens changes from a deeply disappointed, angry, and racist cold warrior into a more humane tragic hero who valorizes traditional family values. Similarly, in Gran Torino, Walt Kowalski, a Korean war veteran and diehard Cold War patriarch, becomes more tolerant toward his Asian immigrant neighborhood. This paper argues that these transformations are the result of re-appropriating, not abandoning, some familiar Cold War populist discourses such as consumer patriotism and Cold War orientalism."
bicycle sharing schemes in trouble: a comparative case study of four cities in korea,2015,"['공공자전거', '기후변화정책', '환경정책', '한국', '지방정부', 'Bike Sharing Schemes', 'Climate Change Policy', 'Korea', 'Political Institutions', 'Civil Society']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Bicycle sharing schemes (BSS) or public bike systems have become increasingly popular in many cities around the world. Whereas existing literature has examined a wide range of issues such as user characteristics, environmental impact, helmet matters and models of provision, a relatively neglected area of academic concern is the political aspect of a BSS including the political decision-making structure and political institutions influencing the effectiveness of the BSS. This paper attempts to fill this void by providing a comparative case study of the BSS in four Korean cities. It finds that mayoral willingness and commitment to the promotion of a BSS as an environmental policy and the number of their consecutive terms in office explain the variation among them in terms of the stability and effectiveness of BSS in Korea. For the further development of BSS, strengthening civil society and the role of the city council is necessary to transform the current top-down governance structure of BSS into a more bottom-up style of governance."

This study proposed a class model for developing a space with organic features included, using a paper folding design practice which has recently been introduced for creative design. The purpose of this project is to present the applicability and educational effect of the class model by analyzing the project results. For this project, this researcher considered how to build three dimensional shapes, folding designs and the theory on organic design, and analyzed educational cases where Rowena Reed’s ‘Creating a structure using a flat surface’ was successfully evolved into an exhibition space design. Also, a survey was conducted to examine the response of the students who joined the project. The survey result showed that at the first stage of the basic design practice, the students understood the principles of formation and the features of folding design, going through the process of transforming a flat surface into three-dimensional surfaces. At the second stage, the students acquired skills to clarify the ideas they gained from the research based on specific information, as well as the three dimensional design. At the third stage, they built capability to plan exhibition and promotion spaces which have organic features and express those spaces in a digital way, putting together all the results mentioned in the two previous stages. When it comes to the level of difficulty and satisfaction of each stage, the students responded that the conceptualization using paper folding was relatively easy. The survey showed that the students’ overall satisfaction at each stage and the project results was high. We conclude that the project is educationally effective and useful."

For this, I named the concept of modern police in the institutional and ideological perspectives, and observed the features of modern police in the four points based by the traditionalism and revisionism. First, discussed the background of establishment. Crime and disorder, those consequences of industrialisation and urbanisation which the traditionalists identified as the basic demand for the modern police. On the other hand, industrialisation and urbanisation as the fundamental sources, of the demand for a new police, the revisionists adds that both processes occurred within a specifically capitalist framework. Capitalism require a tighter disciplining of hitherto relatively loosely regulated aspects of social relations. Second, discussed the opposition movements. The traditionalists think that aristocratic Tories and working-class radical alike protest the establishment of the police for the reason which encroach the supposed traditional liberties of Englishmen. The revisionists observe the initial opposition did come from the traditional landed gentry but distinguished soon. But the deepest source of opposition to the new police came form the working class. Third, discussed the characteristics. The traditionalists argue that the modern police was a novel creation in terms of efficiency and integrity, and it had roots in ancient traditions of communal self-policing. The revisionists think about the new police that they were a bureaucratically organised force charged with a mandate to prevent crime by regular patrol and surveillance of the whole society(but, especially the denizens of the 'dangerous class). Finally, account the accomplishments. In the traditionalists accounts, the social impact of the police was the clearly benign one of solving the crime and disorder, and attribute to national development. In the revisionists account the advent of the modern police transformed the social order into a 'policed society'. As everyone knows, the traditionalism's views are the general perspectives about the development of the modern police, but the revisionism's have the critical points about it. In my opinion, I never intend to reveal 'the right and wrong' for this approach. Instead, combine the two perspectives, expect to have the extended frame of recognition about the modern police."

In this paper, I attempt to analyse unique gaze and desire of Changbi’s Minjung-oriented literary critics. Chapter II deals with the development and transformation of the term ‘Minjung’ in the literary as well as academic field paying attention to the writings of major critics such as Baek Nak-cheong, Yom Mu-ung, and Shin Kyung-lim. In chapter III, I discuss what motivated them to over/underrepresent Minjung’s field of lives and their bodies. They believe that they can find out the best model for sound body and spirit of Minjung in mean and shabby places in Korean society. According to them, true spirit of Minjung are present in various dialects and slangs they speak in everyday lives. Interestingly enough, their concern with physical materials including Minjung’s voice remind us of Heidegger’s metaphysical thinking of presence what Derrida tried to deconstruct in his philosophical investigations. Although there is explicit inconsistency in Changbi’s Minjung-oriented literary criticism, Changbi played a key role in building, spreading, and supporting progressive thoughts in Korean society. It is the specific circumstance where Changbi can be the manifestation of the oppressed but energetic body of Minjung that made Changbi the most influential media in Korean history."

The CV profiles have indicated that Co(II) undergoes facile oxidation and reduction in both the anodic and cathodic potential regions. As a model pollutant allyl chloride was taken to study the effect of Co(II) catalyzed reduction in the cathodic sweep. It was found that allyl chloride was found to undergo reduction catalytically in the presence of Co(II) ion. The diffusion coefficient of Co(II) in [bmim]PF6 found to range between 0.84 x 10-7 to 11.2 x 10-7 cm2/s in the temperature range 25 - 80°C. The extent of allyl chloride reduction was found by potentiostatic electrolysis and the product formed was analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The electrochemical parameters for the reduction of allyl chloride are calculated and discussed.
phototoxicity: its mechanism and animal alternative test methods,2015,"['Phototoxicity', 'UV', 'Animal alternative test method', 'Sunlight', 'In vitro toxicology']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The skin exposure to solar irradiation and photoreactive xenobiotics may produce abnormal skin reaction, phototoxicity. Phototoxicity is an acute light-induced response, which occurs when photoreacive chemicals are activated by solar lights and transformed into products cytotoxic against the skin cells. Multifarious symptoms of phototoxicity are identified, skin irritation, erythema, pruritis, and edema that are similar to those of the exaggerated sunburn. Diverse organic chemicals, especially drugs, are known to induce phototoxicity, which is probably from the common possession of UV-absorbing benzene or heterocyclic rings in their molecular structures. Both UVB (290~320 nm) and UVA (320~400 nm) are responsible for the manifestation of phototoxicity. Absorption of photons and absorbed energy (hv) by photoactive chemicals results in molecular changes or generates reactive oxygen species and depending on the way how endogenous molecules are affected by phototoxicants, mechanisms of phototoxcity is categorized into two modes of action: Direct when unstable species from excited state directly react with the endogenous molecules, and indirect when endogeneous molecules react with secondary photoproducts. In order to identify phototoxic potential of a chemical, various test methods have been introduced. Focus is given to animal alternative test methods, i.e., in vitro, and in chemico assays as well as in vivo. 3T3 neutral red uptake assay, erythrocyte photohemolysis test, and phototoxicity test using human 3-dimensional (3D) epidermis model are examples of in vitro assays.

To verify the difference betweenpoint grinding and traditional grinding, the moving relationship and coordinate transformation between grinding wheel and workpieceare used to put the grain movement function equivalent to parabola, then point grinding cutting path is concluded. Based on grainsdistribution on the grinding wheel surface, the 3D geometry simulation topography of workpiece is obtained by extending the effectiveinterference trails along the axial direction. Furthermore, a vitrified bond CBN wheel with a coarse grinding area angle θ is proposed andthe principle of design and preparation of these novel grinding wheels are studied. The typical processing parameters are chosen to grindQT700 ladder shaft; the simulation results are verified by using the VHX-1000E microscope and the non-contact 3D surface profilometerto observe the workpiece surface topography and measure the surface roughness. The results indicated that the simulation microstructurescoincide well with the experimental measurements and the values of simulation roughness are 0.5 times of experiments. So, the geometricsimulation model provided an auxiliary and prediction method for the actual processing topography analysis. In addition, grindingwheels with different θ are used to grind ladder shafts with a series of grinding parameters. The influence trend of inclining angle α, cuttingdepth ap, axial feeding speed vf and grinding wheel speed vs on surface roughness is obtained. It is concluded that the values ofworkpiece surface roughness using novel grinding wheel are less than using the traditional grinding wheel under the condition of thesame processing parameters."

In this paper, we suggest the ways to improve competitiveness of Korean small and middle-sized business by developing the model of emotional intelligence and leadership. We classified the leadership into three types and examined the organizational citizenship behavior by using the emotional stimulus as a moderating variable. Through the empirical study, we firstly find that the transactional leadership is the most influential on understanding the other``s emotion. Secondly, transformational leadership mostly influences the utilization of emotion among the factors in the emotional intelligence. Thirdly, the servant leadership is the most influential on the other``s emotional appraisal among the elements of emotional intelligence. Fourthly, the utilization of emotion is the most influential on the organizational citizenship behaviour. Among different leadership styles, the transactional leadership is the mostly influencing on the organizational citizenship behaviour through the utilization of emotion and the other``s emotional appraisal in small and medium-sized companies. This result is not concurrent with the study of Bass(1985), Niehoff & Moorman(1993), showing that the transformational leadership is the most influential on the organizational citizenship behaviour. It quite meaningfully shows how Korean small and medium-sized companies are different from those of large companies corporations. The relative significance of transactional leadership is partly due to the recognizable differences of salary, benefits and social recognition between small and medium-sized firms and large companies."

We found that the triazine derivatives acted as mixed-type inhibitors by their adsorption on the metal surface. We also proposed that the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model could be used to explain the adsorption of triazine derivatives. In addition, when the alkyl chain length of the triazine derivative was relatively long, we also obtained a high-adsorption equilibrium constant and low Gibbs free energy of adsorption. Thus, we conclude that the alkyl chain length plays an important role in the corrosion inhibition properties of triazine derivatives."

Provided the variation of disturbance in the two consecutive sampling instances is not changed significantly and the system matrices satisfy the certain conditions, both the system state and the unknown input can be simultaneously estimated by the proposed proportional-integral-derivative observer algorithm. The estimation error can be constrained in a small bounded region of the order of O(T) where T is the sampling rate.

HspX increased interferon-gamma, IL-17A, -12 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-b production and T-bet gene expression but reduced IL-13 production and GATA-3 gene expression. HspX also inhibited asthmatic reactions as demonstrated by an increase in the number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissues, airway luminal narrowing, and airway hyper-responsiveness. Furthermore, HspX enhanced OVA-induced decrease of regulatory T cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes.

identification of novel therapeutic targets in acute leukemias with nras mutations using a pharmacologic approach,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Oncogenic forms of NRAS are frequently associated with hematologic malignancies and other cancers, making them important therapeutic targets. Inhibition of individual downstream effector molecules (eg, RAF kinase) have been complicated by the rapid development of resistance or activation of bypass pathways.

One of the compounds identified, GNF-7, potently and selectively inhibited NRAS-dependent cells in preclinical models of acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Mechanistic analysis revealed that its effects were mediated in part through combined inhibition of ACK1/AKT and of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2 (germinal center kinase). Similar to genetic synthetic lethal approaches, these results suggest that small molecule screens can be used to identity novel therapeutic targets in cells addicted to RAS oncogenes.</P>"
hybrid tiled display system combining distributed rendering and streaming,2015,"['Distributed rendering', 'image streaming', 'tiled display', 'virtual environments']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"A tiled display can be defined as a system in which a single large display screen is connected to several clustered computers. Conventionally, two methods have been adopted to generate a large display screen. The first method utilizes image streaming, whereas the second uses distributed rendering of three-dimensional (3D) model data. Because of the 2D nature of the image-streaming method, it cannot be used to establish a 3D virtual environment and rotational transformation in-depth dimension. In comparison, the distributed rendering method functions within a singular virtual world. In this study, a hybrid distributed rendering system (HDRS) is proposed that consolidates the distributed rendering and image streaming methods, thereby overcoming the disadvantages of each. HDRS consists of master and slave servers on an OpenSG scene-graph platform to integrate the distributed-rendering and image-streaming methods. An independent media server is used to transmit synchronized texture data in parallel. For bandwidth efficiency, the media server deploys an adaptive scaled image based on the depth and position information of a plane. As a result, video frames displayed in a 3D environment can undergo geometric transformations such as rotation, scaling, and translation-enabling compatibility with interaction techniques."
rereading sacrifice: the semiosis of blood,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Blood gains many distinct meanings from different modes of classification, some of which are calibrated by the representational capacities of sacrifice. The Priestly source from Hebrew scriptures and the early Jewish text Second Maccabees both reread ancient sacrifice traditions, articulating new meanings for blood as part of the transformation from a temple-based locative system of animal sacrifice to a utopian decentered model of human self-sacrifice. The Priestly writers created a new semiosis of blood as the purifying essence of temple sacrifice. Second Maccabees offers a temple-replacement ideology with one foot in the locative notion of temple, and the other in suffering and martyrdom—displaced animal sacrifice—as the path to an individual afterlife. Its new meanings for blood are stimulated by conflict over two competing locative systems (foreign and native) and the need to, even while renewing, ultimately replace the temple cult."
a unified framework for event summarization and rare event detection from multiple views,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>A novel approach for event summarization and rare event detection is proposed. Unlike conventional methods that deal with event summarization and rare event detection independently, our method solves them in a single framework by transforming them into a graph editing problem. In our approach, a video is represented by a graph, each node of which indicates an event obtained by segmenting the video spatially and temporally. The edges between nodes describe the relationship between events. Based on the degree of relations, edges have different weights. After learning the graph structure, our method finds subgraphs that represent event summarization and rare events in the video by editing the graph, that is, merging its subgraphs or pruning its edges. The graph is edited to minimize a predefined energy model with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The energy model consists of several parameters that represent the causality, frequency, and significance of events. We design a specific energy model that uses these parameters to satisfy each objective of event summarization and rare event detection. The proposed method is extended to obtain event summarization and rare event detection results across multiple videos captured from multiple views. For this purpose, the proposed method independently learns and edits each graph of individual videos for event summarization or rare event detection. Then, the method matches the extracted multiple graphs to each other, and constructs a single composite graph that represents event summarization or rare events from multiple views.

new insights into corona discharge surface ionization of polyethylene terephthalate via a combined computational and experimental assessment,2015,"['Corona discharge process', 'Polyethylene terephthalate', 'Computational chemistry', 'IR spectra']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The aim of the present work is to demonstrate the influence of corona discharge ionization on chemical and physical properties of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers using computational and experimental studies. In the computational section, the vibrational frequencies of proposed models for PET before and after corona discharge treatment were predicted in the liquid phase at both the B3LYP/6-31G/COSMO and B3PW91/6-31G/COSMO level of theories using the harmonic approximation. When compared to B3LYP, the frequencies obtained for the B3PW91 show a better linear correlation with the experimental data. Furthermore, experimental studies were carried out by the use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and reflectance spectroscopy (RS). Experimental evidence indicated that the corona discharge modifies the surface of fibers and also increases the reactivity of PET toward cationic dyes. Our combined computational and experimental parametric study clearly confirms that the changes occurred on the PET surface due to corona discharge ionization."

This study reports the adsorption kinetics, equilibrium and thermodynamics ofTBBPA on fly ash modified by nanostructured MnO2 (FA@nM). The resulting nano-adsorbent wascharacterized by means of the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), XRD and scanning electronmicroscope (SEM). The adsorption results showed that the equilibrium adsorption capacity has beensignificantly improved by increasing the initial TBBPA concentration and contact time. While a largereduction of TBBPA uptake was observed in alkaline conditions and at high temperatures and ionicstrength. The equilibrium between TBBPA and FA@nM was achieved in approximately 40 min withremoval of 98% of the TBBPA. The sorption kinetics were well described by a pseudo-first-order ratemodel, while both Langmuir and Freundlich models described the sorption isotherms well at 298 K.Thermodynamic parameters suggested that the adsorption of TBBPA is exothermic and spontaneous atthe temperatures studied. As fly ash is a low-cost material that is often available on-site, it offers aninteresting alternative to high-cost advanced wastewater treatment systems for removing such organicpollutants."

a new stable and accurate algorithm of large image mosaic,2015,"['Image mosaic', 'Harris corner', 'Image matching', 'Gradient information', 'Edge detector']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Due to the overlapped region and image size of the input image pair is unpredictable, it makes the matching procedure more difficult and unstable. For the purpose of finding out the stable and accurate matching algorithm of large images, we give an analysis of different kinds of characters, such as, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), local maximum gradient descriptor, Harris corners, and the maximum curvature points of the image edges, etc. Based on the experiments of different images, a new stable matching algorithm is proposed in this paper. In our model, the matching procedure is divided into two stages, the rough and accurate matching procedures. To evaluate the matching result, the edge information is combined with the local maximum gradient of the input images as the constraint of our matching algorithm. After the extraction of the local maximum gradient character points, we use the edge information to divide these points into different classes. Then, the searching of the stable and accurate matching problem becomes to find out the best matching results which agree to the edge constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient and stable than the other kinds of matching algorithms especially in the proposing of large size images."

Secondly, product conceptual design model is proposed based on modular configuration. The approximate products program will be obtained through retrieval and matching of each module of product using the knowledge base and case base. Thirdly, Intuitionistic Fuzzy theory and Monte Carlo method are respectively used to process the qualitative and quantitative uncertain information of green features in order to ensure the accuracy of the evaluation results.

The resulting fibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse absorbance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The synthesized fibers were used for the adsorption of Congo red (CR) dye from aqueous solutions at different solution pH, initial dye concentrations and temperatures. Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models were applied to determine the interaction between the synthesized fibers and CR. The adsorption efficacy of the pTSA-Pani@GN-PVC composite fiber for the removal of CR was 4.43 and 2.51 times higher than that of the PVC and GN-PVC fibers, respectively. Thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption of CR onto all the fibers was exothermic in nature and that the spontaneity decreased with increasing solution temperature.</P>"

Even the studies that empirically discussed the novel's external relations with the characters with a focus on the actual models(Choi Yong-shin and Shim Jae-yeong) were based on those achievements. It was also pointed out that the novel focused on the devoted enlightenment efforts and romantic dating of the main characters, Chae Yeong-shin and Park Dong-hyeok, and accordingly was not free from the popular nature of serial story in newspapers. Those discussions have converged into the possibilities and limitations as a farmers' novel and the results as an enlightenment novel. Resistance consciousness inherent in the novel, however, has not attracted enough attention from the researchers due to the optimistic perspective found in the novel. When attention is paid to the process of Park Dong-hyeok's rural movement being transformed into the Rural Revitalization Campaign(RRC) by the ruling Japanese, will for resistance and directionality is revealed rather strongly with the resistance discourse hidden in the work. It is because the conflicts and collapses in the novel are attributed to the clash between the local organization of the ruling Japanese and the farmers' organization of rural areas.In the novel, homes(centers for farmers and schools) are the places to uplift the ideology of rural movement and practice a community life, which is why Park Dong-heok builds a center for farmers after returning to Hangok-ri and Chae Yeong-shin builds a school after returning to Cheongseokgol. The two main characters' commitment and sacrifice is embodied in house building with the direction of resistance against oppression proposed through house keeping. Park is put in prison in the process of his center for farmers built with his farmer friends being changed into an RRC center due to the plot of Kang Gi-cheon. Chae is also put in jail while raising funds to build a school. Those episodes indicate that the ruling Japanese were controlling the rural communities including even the remote villages by forming an RRC, a semi-administrative organization, to maintain their exploitation system. It also has something to do with the death from overwork of Chae that was devoted to house building, trying to overcome the hardship. Before her death, she left a will on house keeping because a house was a base for the resistance movement. Park's return to house(center for farmers) implies broad resistance through the reorganization of farmers' organizations that had been extinct or absorbed into RRC by the ruling Japanese."

Condurango bark extract is also known to reduce tumor volume, but the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. Methods: Using a cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) as our model, the molecular events behind condurango extract's (CE's) anticancer effect were investigated by using flow cytometry, immunoblotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Other included cell types were prostate cancer cells (PC3), transformed liver cells (WRL-68), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: Condurango extract (CE) was found to be cytotoxic against target cells, and this was significantly deactivated in the presence of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that its action could be mediated through ROS generation. CE caused an increase in the HeLa cell population containing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage at the G zero/Growth 1 (G0/G1) stage. Further, CE increased the tumor necrosis factor alpha ($TNF-{\alpha}$) and the fas receptor (FasR) levels both at the ribonucleic acid (RNA) and the protein levels, indicating that CE might have a cytotoxic mechanism of action. CE also triggered a sharp decrease in the expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ($NF-{\kappa}B$) both at the RNA and the protein levels, a possible route to attenuation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and caused an opening of the mitochondrial membrane's permeability transition (MPT) pores, thus enhancing caspase activities. Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest possible pathways for CE mediated cytotoxicity in model cancer cells."

Outwardly, 'green growth' of Korea is the plan to make Korea an eco-friendly nation, but this contains the factors, fatal to the environment. The four-river project, a major project of green growth, has brought a fall in the maintenance functions of the four river environments. Besides, it is hard to develop and supply new and renewable energy in Korea. In this situation, the MB government increased the rate of dependence on nuclear energy with an image of clean energy, not new and renewable energy. The problem is that nuclear power plants do not produce clean energy sources. Also, there are yet no definite measures against nuclear waste treatment, even though nuclear waste storage facilities are saturated in Korea. Korea is suffering from aftereffects of the four-river project and the nuclear waste problem would appear by gradation. In this situation, Korean church must have an ecological sensitivity. Johann Christoph Blumhardt sighed not only for physical healing but for social healing and ecological recovery. He even considered ecological rather than merely being satisfied with personal recovery. Also, Korean church needs to act with a prophetic spirituality. Germany went through a revolution that swept the whole Europe, too from 1848 to 1849. In this chaotic period of time, he mentioned constitutional monarchy, arguing that ‘God creates a new border in the society and policy'. Even when there was no word, democracy, Johann Christoph Blumhardt talked about democratic culture. Blumhardt also regarded discipleship as a type of struggle. The Father and Son Blumhardt did not mention the calling of prayer that lacked an act. The kingdom of God is where ""to act with a wait"". This is a socio-transformational act, described by Karl Barth. Church is the third sector and belongs to a territory of civil society. Christians in Korean church should be faithful disciples of Jesus Christ and honest citizens in civil society. If preachers make believers feel a good empathy with this problem of our society and teach them, Korean civil society will come to maturity through churches."

The idea of Buddha-nature of the Mahayana Nirvana Sutra elevated human being to the level of the Buddha. In this respect, the idea is the forgoer of respect for human dignity and human rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and human rights provisions in the basic laws of the developed democracies. Mahayana Nirvana-sutra also tells us what the main causes of human sufferings are, what the vision of the future is, and what men should do to actualize the vision. The political ideologies generally ascribe the causes of human sufferings to certain social system or social groups. Their future visions tend to be the society in which the existing social system is transformed and some groups or individuals are eliminated. The Mahayana Nirvana-sutra ascribes the human suffering to the lack of enlightenment of Buddha nature and three fires of human greed, anger and ignorance. The vision of the sutra is the world of 常·樂·我·淨 eternity, bliss, personality, and purity where even icchantikas, the most devilry persons also should be redeemed by recovering their Buddha-nature. In the sutra, the future vision is actualized by awakening Buddha-nature in every man`s mind and practicing the bodhisattva path. If the Mahayana Nirvana-sutra is able to guide the political ideologies, the politics in the world would be greatly improved and purified. The Nirvana-sutra of Pali version includes the teachings of the seven no-decline laws for Vajji republic in the face of aggression and some principles for the operation of Sangha community. We can get some hint from the teachings for the current republican operation of the developed nations."
cytoplasmic drak1 overexpressed in head and neck cancers inhibits tgf-β1 tumor suppressor activity by binding to smad3 to interrupt its complex formation with smad4,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an extremely aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis and low patient survival. Because chemotherapy for advanced HNSCC is often ineffective, discovering new therapeutic targets that are important for HNSCC development and progression and elucidating their molecular mechanisms are required. In the present study, we describe the role of DRAK1 (death-associated protein kinase-related apoptosis-inducing kinase 1) as a novel negative regulator of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) tumor suppressor signaling pathway for the first time in human HNSCC cells. DRAK1 was significantly overexpressed in primary human HNSCCs and in HNSCC cell lines. Through gain-and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that the DRAK1 expression level regulated TGF-beta 1-induced transcriptional activity and expression of the tumor suppressor gene p21Waf1/Cip1. DRAK1 depletion enhanced TGF-beta 1-induced growth inhibition in vitro and suppressed tumorigenicity in xenograft models in vivo. Mechanistically, DRAK1 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and bound to Smad3, thereby interrupting Smad3/Smad4 complex formation, which is the core process for the induction of tumor suppressor genes by TGF-beta 1. Thus, our findings suggest that cytoplasmic DRAK1 increases tumorigenic potential through inhibition of TGF-beta 1-mediated tumor suppressor activity in HNSCC cells and may be a potential therapeutic target for HNSCCs.</P>"
meteorin is upregulated in reactive astrocytes and functions as a negative feedback effector in reactive gliosis,2015,"['meteorin', 'reactive gliosis', 'astrocyte', 'photothrombotic ischemia']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Reactive gliosis is a glial response to a wide range of central nervous system insults, which results in cellular and molecular changes to resting glial cells. Despite its fundamental effect on neuropathologies, the identification and characterization of the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain to be fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to analyze the expression profile and functions of the astrocytic neurotrophic factor, meteorin, in the progression of reactive gliosis. A mouse model of photothrombotic ischemia, and a primary astrocyte culture were used in the present study. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were performed to examine the expression levels of meteorin and reactive gliosis markers. Increased expression levels of meteorin were observed in reactive astrocytes in a photothrombotic ischemia mouse model, as well as in cultured astrocytes, which were stimulated by transforming growth factor-β1. Exogenous treatment of the astrocytes with meteorin did not induce janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling, however, silencing the expression of meteorin in the astrocytes resulted in an upregulation of reactive astrocyte markers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100β, indicating that endogenous meteorin is required for the maintenance of astrocytic homeostasis. These results suggested a novel role for meteorin as a negative feedback effector in reactive gliosis.</P>"

The timing jitter of Er-fiber lasers with 9-nm bandpass filters operating at + 0.0084 ps<sup>2</sup> is measured to be 3.46 fs (rms) when integrated from 10 kHz to 10 MHz offset frequency, which is similar to the jitter level of typical stretched-pulse or soliton Er-fiber lasers. The numerical simulation based on split-step Fourier transform method shows that the measured high-frequency jitter is quantum noise-limited performance. We also develop an analytical model for filtered normal-dispersion fiber lasers by modifying the well-established noise model of stretched-pulse fiber lasers. The analytical modeling reveals that the jitter performance is improved mostly by reducing the chirp parameter by intra-cavity filtering. Both numerical simulation and analytical model fit fairly well with the measured timing jitter result.</P>"

There appeared a big difference in most aspects of story structure, the contents, and Buddha of the two texts. They are both based on the eight events of Buddha’s life story. Buddhacarita describes Buddha’s story focusing on after His enlightenment while Wolincheongangjigok depicts the eight events in balanced way. Buddhacarita can be said to be a realistic and historical text focusing on the doctrines while Wolincheongangjigok is said to be a mythical one focusing on His virtues and power of His salvation. Buddha in Buddhacarita is an ideal model and teacher for the enlightenment and in Wolincheongangjigok an ethical model and God for sentient beings to depend on.As for the contents Buddhacarita deals with Buddha’s this life and early doctrines in detail such as the Four Noble Truth, the Noble Eightfold Path, No-self, precepts, generosity and karma, etc. But Wolincheongangjigok includes Jataka stories mainly with Mahayana sutras like Lotus Sutra, Boeungyung. These Mahayana sutras play a role of Buddha’s preaching. And the themes of Jataka which Wolincheongangjigok adopts are intended to emphasize the Buddha’s compassion and filial piety.Buddha in Wolincheongangjigok is a transformed body to awaken sentient beings. Therefore He emphasizes to make Buddha images and worship His relics substituting for Buddha. Buddha of Wolincheongangjigok has the meaning of reacting against the circumstances of revering Confucianism and suppressing Buddhism in Joseon Dynasty. The tendency of Wolincheongangjigok has affected today Korean folk Buddhism in some way.Lastly Buddhacarita features various steps of Buddha’s story development before the formalization of Buddha’s story. Wolincheongangjigok is the text of focusing on His family."

With an ethnographic methodology, this research analyzes how Buddhist organizations in South Korea are implementing business concepts and methods in temples with the aim of increasing their influence in society. It addresses how managerial models and advertising techniques have been appropriated in a religious context and how they interact with redefinitions of Buddhist propagation. This paper argues that the use of communication and management techniques from the business world is not an epiphenomenon. Instead, it echoes a deeper transformation of Buddhism within South Korean society, especially in the role and place of the laity. For the urban temples engaged in ambitious development projects, the use of market related techniques is not merely a way to engage in a market-like competition. It also contributes to redefine their organizational structure as well as their division of religious work, in affinity with a dominant concept of religion."

Firstly, it was discovered that allegory strategies have been used as a mechanism to recognize the world and express the view of value of the writer. In other words, allegory strategies have functioned as a highly effective technology mechanism that can help the writer trying to choose between intense to reveal essential contradiction and external regulations of the violent dictatorial government. Secondly, it was discovered that allegory strategies have been used as a mechanism to appear the distinct characteristics of the genre effectively.

His assertion is well attested in the Buddhist narratives. There are many miraculous stories performed by the Buddha and his eminent disciples. Their biographies are enlarged with the quantitative development of those stories. This is well illustrated in the Avadana literature. This paper specifies how Buddhism gained popularity in Indian society where competition between religious groups was extreme. The stories of the Divyavadana reflect the religious situation of that time. Through an analysis of the Purnavadana(PA), 2nd story from the Divyavadana, this paper shows how meditation was used as a miraculous tool to gain the hearts and minds of the Indian audience. In the Avadanas including the Purnavadana, the role of meditation is not vividly present. In the Avadanas, as a tool for miraculous power, meditation is used to transform the audience. Since the intention of this kind of Avadana is to inspire the audience through the religious deeds by the Buddha and his disciples, meditation is mainly used to illustrate their powers. Therefore, the Buddhist monks could establish their competitive status using the power of meditation to gain popularity in Indian society. This power becomes apparent whenever it is needed by the audience. In the Purnavadana, there appear various terms and expressions related to meditation. Here it is not appropriate to discuss their doctrinal or technical aspects since they are used as a skill-in-means to consolidate the authority or miraculous power of the Buddha and his disciples. Being endowed with the power of meditation, they could become the refuge for lay people. Thus, meditation played an important role in establishing the saint image of the Buddhist monks. They were supposed to come and help whenever lay people needed them. This idea was developed into the arhat cult that appealed widely to audiences in East Asia afterwards."

silymarin inhibits the progression of fibrosis in the early stages of liver injury in ccl4-treated rats,2015,"['liver fibrosis', 'oxidative stress', 'Silymarin']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Liver fibrosis, a common condition occurring during the evolution of almost all chronic liver diseases, is the consequence of hepatocyte injury that leads to the activation of Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells (HSC). Silymarin (Si) is a herbal product widely used for its hepatoprotective potential. Our study aims to investigate the effects of two different doses of Silymarin on a CCl4-induced model of liver fibrosis with a focus on the early stages of liver injury. Fifty Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10): control group (sunflower oil twice a week); CMC group (carboxymethyl cellulose five times a week, sunflower oil twice a week); CCl4 group (CCl4 in sunflower oil, by gavage, twice a week); CCl4 + Si 50 group (CCl4 twice a week, Silymarin 50 mg/b.w. in CMC five times a week); and CCl4 + Si 200 group (similar to the previous group, with Si 200 mg/b.w.). One month after the experiment began we explored hepato-cytolysis (aminotransferases and lactate dehydrogenase), oxidative stress, fibrosis (histological score, hyaluronic acid), markers of HSC activation (transforming growth factor β1 [TGF-β1], and α-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA] expression by western blot) and activation of Kupffer cells by immunohistochemistry. Our data showed that Si 50 mg/b.w. had the capacity of reducing oxidative stress, hepato-cytolysis, fibrosis, activation of Kupffer cells, and the expression of a-SMA and TGF-β1 with better results than Si 200 mg/b.w. Thus, the usual therapeutic dose of Silymarin, administered in the early stages of fibrotic changes is capable of inhibiting the fibrogenetic mechanism and the progression of initial liver fibrosis."

By the fordist effect in the 1920s, west europe carried on a rationalization program through a transformation of Fordism in accordance with each nation’s condition. In case of Germany, however, could never proceed the rationalization in terms of a business including a continued economic crisis after World War Ⅰ. thus Germany could’t get a successful result of industrial rationalization except for a part of company’s trial in the development of compact car. Under a Nazi germany in the 1930s, Volkswagen-Project is regarded as a tool of elimination of discrimination and division among the inside the german society. On the other hand, RDA, German automobile associate, has tried to the project on the point that it had been never considered in terms of a economic condition. In this situation, it is Ferdinand Porsche’s development effort in the car design and a Deutsche Arberitsfront’s take over of the control about Volkswagen from RDA that a developing the car model and establishing the plant could be succeed. Nevertheless, Volkswagen project was failure as a result. ‘a car for the people’ insisted by the Nazi could barely produced under Third Reich, german automobile industry was still interested not in the production of people’s car but in an profit optimization. Porsche, in the same manner, participated in the project for his longtime dream, the production of compact car. therefore, it is possible to find out a real Volkswagen, in terms of a car for the people, was not exist under the Nazism."

The PU membrane wasprepared from a wet phase inversion method and a two-step solution polymerization from polycaprolactone diols(PCL), 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA), etc. The chemical structure,phase state, morphology and surface wettability of the membrane were characterized with Fourier transform infrared(FTIR) spectrometer, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contactangle tester, respectively. The temperature and pH responses of the membrane were investigated by means of anamino-acid permeate experiment. The L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) was chosen as model amino-acids. The permeation of theL-Phe was measured using a dead-end flow filtration at varied temperatures and pH, and characterized by the permeateflux (J) and rejection coefficient (R). J of the L-Phe across the PU membrane increased with increasingtemperature and showed a sharp increase when temperature was raised to the crystalline melting temperature (Tm)of the soft segment of PU, while decreased with increasing pH and having a sharp decrease when pH reached thedissociation constant (pKa) of DMPA contained in PU macromolecules. While, the R behavior of L-Phe was justopposite from the results of J, which decreased with increasing temperature and increased with increasing pH,also showing the temperature and pH responses. Hopefully, the PU membrane with temperature- and pH-controllablepermeability has promising prospects in water treatment, membrane separation, drug delivery system, etc."

The objective is to investigate the effect of spatial differences in oscillator parametersand initial conditions that occur in realistic systems. The coupling between the neighboring oscillators is modeled as a lineardissipative element, and the mathematical model is analyzed asymptotically and numerically. Synchronization of self excited oscillatorsin mechanical systems has been predominantly investigated in recent literature by focusing on its parameter dependence. This work investigatesthe dependence of dynamics of such systems on initial conditions. The analysis is conducted for identical oscillators as well asoscillators with a frequency mismatch, along with three different sets of initial conditions. The dynamics of the system is discussed basedon time plots, frequency plots, instantaneous dynamics of each oscillator by Hilbert transform and the phase equation obtained by asymptoticexpansion. The study reveals interesting phenomena like amplitude death, oscillation suppression, oscillation resurrection, frequencylocking and beat frequency in the model when subjected to the different set of initial conditions."

In each of these works, the women portrayed are confronted with death, madness, and disease. Poe’s “The Oval Portrait,” which associates beautiful women with death, transforms the visuality of art into the written word, that of the narrator. This work is about a ‘desperately wounded’ narrator who chances to pass a night in an abandoned chateau where he happens upon an intriguing portrait. His subsequent depiction of the work can be read as a metaphor of translation. The portrait’s painter was so obsessed with his art that he translated the subject of the work, his wife, into a lifeless model while the narrator translates the painting into a text, which is twice removed from the original subject. The artist willingly sacrificed his wife to create a perfect image. Now the narrator sees the painter’s art and violates the traditional principle of translation. In his description, there is a defusion of, or illusion between, life and art, all using vague and quaint language. The narrator is by no means a reliable source of the tale; therefore, the whole story becomes doubly framed, first by the frame of the portrait, and then by the frame of the narrative. Poe never truly wrote about women. Instead, he wrote about a female object and ignored individual character that add depth or believability to the repeated stereotypes of the beautiful damsel. In a similar manner, the other two novels, Jane Eyre, and Dracula, depict women with madness and disease. In Jane Eyre, the character Bertha, who is insane, is described through Rochester. Neither he nor Jane, as narrators, is reliable for representing the whole aspects of Bertha. She is just the catalyst to let Jane establish an ideal home with Rochester. In Stoker’s novel, Dracula is indicated as a man in character. However, in his attack on Lucy, he shows her, a proper lady or angel, as having the ideal feminine behavior in the 19th century. The male narrators, including Doctor Van Helsing, justify Lucy as the woman whose purpose is as victim. Likewise, the original aspects of the women are depicted through death, madness, and disease, but are never shown as real subjects, only reproductions of cultural images via the narrator’s emotions and the objects of fear and agitation."

This article defines as ``The Optimism on Atomic Energy`` such a social phenomenon, and analysis it critically in terms of fetishistic belief. To this end, at first we reviewed Takashi Nagai`s life and thought as a model example of optimism on atomic energy in the second section. Above all, we paid attention to his three identities to be called an atomic scientist, Catholic and subjects of Japanese empire to determine what made his optimistic belief in nuclear power. His case offered us important two clues. Firstly, It goes to show that cause of his optimistic belief in nuclear power not in the nuclear power itself but in his religious and ideological desires for something different. Secondly, the nuclear power exposed as a ``fetish`` that some kinds of desire and fantasy made, which had already before the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, and had been strengthened taking that opportunity. The next thing, in the third section we researched change of ``the public acceptance of nuclear power`` after ``the Fukushima`` in Korean society. Many researches and studies performed after ``the Fukushima`` showed that while the Korean general public indirectly experienced disaster of ``the Fukushima``, they still maintain an optimistic attitude toward nuclear energy. Therefore, we pointed out that the optimism on atomic energy in Korean society after ``the Fukushima`` made fetishistic belief in the economic efficiency of nuclear power, and then suppressed dangerousness of nuclear energy and various social sufferings deeply involved with nuclear power. In the fourth section, we considered that what logical structure fetishistic belief has internally, specifying ``the optimism on atomic energy`` into a discussion on ``the fetishistic belief`` that can be compared to religious belief. Also the optimism on atomic energy can be interpreted in terms of fetishism, because nuclear energy is considered as vital energy and be unquestioningly accepted among the people for the sole reason it has the highest economic efficiency. In addition, we explained what the way that approach to ``the optimism on atomic energy`` in terms of ``fetishistic belief`` means to theological studies or religious studies, focusing on the imagination or the appearance of the kernel in Marx`s theory of commodity fetishism. Finally, in the fifth section we demonstrated that the reason, of which the Korean general public shows fetishistic attitude in dealing with the discourse on economics of nuclear energy, is, optimism of nuclear power closely correspond to their own unconscious desires for development. In conclusion, we reconfirmed that optimism of nuclear power is ``the objective thought forms`` in the developmental capitalism. Thus unless we transform current our own social relations that structuring developmental capitalism, we will never remove optimism of nuclear power that the Korean general public has under any circumstance."

Three mix designs selected from a previous laboratory testing program include the standard mixture with 0.40 water-cement ratio, the ICC with 0.32 water-cement ratio, and the ICC mixture with 0.40 water-cement ratio. Concrete samples were prepared and laboratory tests were performed to measure strength, elastic modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion and shrinkage properties. The environmental responses were measured using strain gages, thermocouples, and linear variable differential transformers instrumented in full-scale concrete slabs. A 3-D finite element model was developed and calibrated using strain data measured from the full-scale tests using the HVS. The results indicate that the ICC slabs were less susceptible to the change of environmental conditions and appear to have better potential performance based on the critical stress analysis."
the relationship between education level and mammographic density,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"To further understand the factors that contribute to interindividual variation in mammographic density, we evaluated the relationship between education level and each component of the mammographic density measures. Study participants included 535 women between 40 and 65 years of age who received a mammogram for a population-based twin and family study. Mammographic density was measured from digital mammograms using a computer-assisted thresholding method. To avoid negative confounding by obesity level, we calculated BMI-adjusted mammographic measures. Thereafter, each of the mammographic density measures was t-transformed using its mean value and SD for each age strata. The level of education was chosen as a marker representing socioeconomic status at the individual level. A linear mixed model considering familial correlations was used for analyses. In the unadjusted analysis for all women, the BMI-adjusted nondense area gradually decreased with an increase in education level (P for trend=0.017). This association persisted after adjusting for menstrual and reproductive factors. When we repeated the analysis according to menopausal status, an inverse association between education level and nondense area was evident in premenopausal women, whereas the inverse association attenuated to a statistically insignificant level after adjusting for menstrual and reproductive factors in postmenopausal women. Absolute dense area and percentage dense area were not associated with education level. The significant association between nondense area and education level after eliminating the effect of age and BMI suggests that socioeconomic factors may have an influential role in determining the amount of fat tissue in the breast."
docosahexaenoic acid alleviates atopic dermatitis by generating tregs and il-10/tgf-β-modified macrophages via a tgf-β-dependent mechanism,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have key roles in the immune response by suppressing the differentiation and proliferation of various immune cells. The beneficial effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been described for many diseases; however, the mechanism by which it modulates the immune system is poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether DHA suppresses allergic reactions and upregulates the generation of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells. We also examined the effects of transfusing interleukin-10/transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-modified macrophages (M2 macrophages) treated with DHA into a mouse model of atopic dermatitis. Here, we show that administration of DHA upregulates the generation of TGF-beta-dependent CD4(+) forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3(+)) Tregs. DHA induced T-cell hypo-responsiveness and downregulated cytokines associated with T helper (Th)-1, Th2, and Th17 cells. The differentiation of Foxp3(+) Tregs into CD4(+) T cells was directly mediated by DHA-M2 macrophages, which deactivated effector macrophages and inhibited CD4(+) T-cell proliferation. DHA showed therapeutic effects in mice with experimental atopic dermatitis. These results show that DHA enhances the function of M2 macrophages and that the generation of Tregs effectively protects mice against an inflammatory immune disorder. Thus, DHA may be a useful therapeutic strategy for treating chronic inflammatory diseases.</P>"
ganoderma lucidum pharmacopuncture for teating ethanol-induced chronic gastric ulcers in rats,2015,"['chronic gastric ulcer', 'ethanol induced', 'functional dyspepsia', 'Ganoderma lucidum', 'gastric mucosa', 'pharmacopuncture']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Objectives: The stomach is a sensitive digestive organ that is susceptible to exogenous pathogens from the diet. In response to such pathogens, the stomach induces oxidative stress, which might be related to the development of both gastric organic disorders such as gastritis, gastric ulcers, and gastric cancer, and functional disorders such as functional dyspepsia. This study was accomplished to investigate the effect of Ganoderma lucidum pharmacopuncture (GLP) on chronic gastric ulcers in rats. Methods: The rats were divided into 4 groups of 8 animals each: the normal, the control, the normal saline (NP) and the GLP groups. In this study, the modified ethanol gastritis model was used. The rats were administrated 56% ethanol orally every other day. The dose of ethanol was 8 g/kg body weight. The normal group received the same amount of normal saline instead of ethanol. The NP and the GLP groups were treated with injection of saline and GLP respectively. The control group received no treatment. Two local acupoints CV12 (中脘) and ST36 (足三里) were used. All laboratory rats underwent treatment for 15 days. On last day, the rats were sacrificed and their stomachs were immediately excised. Results: Ulcers of the gastric mucosa appeared as elongated bands of hemorrhagic lesions parallel to the long axis of the stomach. In the NP and GLP groups, the injuries to the gastric mucosal injuries were not as severe as they were in the control group. Wound healings of the chronic gastric ulcers was promoted by using GLP and significant alterations of the indices in the gastric mucosa were observed. Such protection was demonstrated by gross appearance, histology and immunehistochemistry staining for Bcl-2-associated X (BAX), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-${\beta}1$). Conclusion: These results suggest that GLP at CV12 and ST36 can provide significant protection to the gastric mucosa against an ethanol induced chronic gastric ulcer."

Successful preparation of PEI/NONOate was confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry. NO/PPNPs were characterized by particle size, surface charge, and NO loading. The NO/PPNPs showed a prolonged NO release profile over 6 days without any burst release. The NO/PPNPs exhibited potent bactericidal efficacy against methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (MRSA) and <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> concentration-dependently and showed the ability to bind on the surface of the bacteria. We also found that the NO released from the NO/PPNPs mediates bactericidal efficacy and is not toxic to healthy fibroblast cells. Furthermore, NO/PPNPs accelerated wound healing and epithelialization in a mouse model of a MRSA-infected wound. Therefore, our results suggest that the NO/PPNPs presented in this study could be a suitable approach for treating wounds and various skin infections.</P>"
observer design for one-sided lipschitz nonlinear systems subject to measurement delays,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>This paper presents a novel nonlinear observer-design approach to one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear systems in the presence of output delays. The crux of the approach is to overcome the practical consequences of time delays, encountered due to distant sensor position and time lag in measurement, for estimation of physical and engineering nonlinear system states. A Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is employed, the time derivative of which is solved using Jensen’s inequality, one-sided Lipschitz condition, and quadratic inner-boundedness, and, accordingly, design conditions for delay-range-dependent nonlinear observer for delayed one-sided Lipschitz systems are derived. Further, novel solutions to the problems of delay-dependent observer synthesis of one-sided Lipschitz models and delay-range-dependent state estimation of linear and Lipschitz nonlinear systems are deduced from the present delay-range-dependent technique. An observer formulation methodology for retrieval of one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear-system states, which is robust against<SUB>L2</SUB>norm-bounded perturbations, is devised. The resultant design conditions, in contrast to the conventional procedures, can be solved via less conservative linear matrix inequality- (LMI-) based routines that succeed by virtue of additional LMI variables, meaningful transformations, and cone complementary linearization algorithm. Numerical examples are worked out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed observer-synthesis approach for delayed one-sided Lipschitz systems.</P>"

Patriarchal fatherhood is found to be premodern and should be modernistically transformed in this era. Especially, it is stressed that the shift in directing point of fatherhood can bring happiness in family structure: from public identity to familism value. Most of all, it is shown that the roles of motherhood should be transformed into epicene roles. In those gender equality can play a critical role in children’s gender role socialization.

We find that the first component is correlated positively to the entrance temperature of various devices such as compressor, expander, evaporator, and the second, negatively to condenser. We then model the power consumption as a multiple regression with two and/or three transformed variables of the selected principal components. We find that fitted value from the multiple regression explains 80~90% of the observed value of the power consumption. This results can be applied to a more elaborate control of the power consumption in the heat pump dryer."

The mass diet was shaped by the social structural transformations as well as the changes in the production and consumption of the meat. The agricultural industrialization was promoted by the economic transformation into the corporate capitalism in the early 20th century. In the late 1930s US ‘Green Revolution’ got into its stride and made the crucial influences on the making of ‘the factory farming’, which was droved by the big packers in the system of the meat processing and distribution. These changes in the upstream of the meat production has been linked with the changes in the downstream such as the super-market as the new retailer industry. As a result, the convenience and accessibility to meat were dramatically upgraded. At the same time, the new family form to be harmony with the corporate capitalism was explored in the early 20th century US. The emerging American nuclear family expressed the strong affinity with a domestic livelihood scientifically managed by a mother-housekeeper, looking forward the intimate domesticity. Especially, the home cooking with meat was considered as the expression of the mother-housekeeper’s love to the husband and children. The new family form and the new dietary way of life were spread to the working class during the Second World War and the post-war prosperity. The consumerism as the dominant ideology of the consumer society contributed to the this historical process. The consumerism made ‘the convenient meat’ as the symbol of the American modernity through presenting the purchase of the new technology provided by the corporate food system as a solution to the question, how we could made the modern domesticity. As a rule, in the 1950s, the golden age of the family, consumeristic meat meal based on beef was fully established. But the trend of the meatification of diet tends to create the over-taking meat and related health and ecological problem."

GCE means post-modern education beyond modern public education. In the latter, teachers used to have been affiliated with nation-building mission, professional service to learners, and sometimes teacher unionism. These affiliations are typically of modern nationalism and industrialism. Teachers for GCE stand on different ground for their professional practice: global civil right to teach, global civil right to learn, and finally peoples’ fundamental right for development. Their sight extends beyond national territory up to global world and cyber space. They overcome modernity to practice transformative pedagogy accommodating multi-cultural dimensions. The image can be summarized as a model global citizen who serves highly for the benefit of mankind, which characterizes Korean educational ideal as provided by the foundation law of education Korea."

To achieve this aim, the method of historical-semantic-theological interpretation is employed. According to Peter and John, a true communication is seen among the triune God, among the local churches, among the groups in a congregation, and between the two authors/readers and the Old Testament. But a negative communication is displayed in the Neronian policy and in the Nicolaitans’ heretical activity. Peter and John maintain that the reconciliation takes place by the mediatorial works of Christ, on which the recreational work of the saints should firmly stand. Peter and John propose a perfect model of coexistence which is realized in the co-work of the triune God. Christians, as the provisional residents and sojourners, should keep their identity boundary in the persecuting world for the sake of transforming the antichristian society into the kingdom of God. Strengthening the boundary ultimately leads broadening the boundary. Lastly, the present researcher discusses some methods the Church can use for actualizing communication, reconciliation and coexistence in the Korean context. Facing both the decline of Christians and the negative power of anti-christians, the Korean church can take a chance to reverse these undesirable phenomena if she wisely applies the teachings of Peter and John regarding communication, reconciliation, coexistence into the Korean context."

These companies were assessed in terms of CCR, BCC, and scale efficiency, and were found to be operating under an appropriately efficient scale. This study aims to determine the operating conditions by analyzing the effectiveness of existing domestic forwarding companies, which has not been studied before, and provide suggestions for improving the operational efficiency of forwarding companies in Korea. The average efficiency in terms of CCR for the year 2014 was found to be 0.75, which is a low level that indicates over-commitment and inefficiency. The operating expenses and employee capital generation in operational terms exhibited inefficiencies attributable to scale, which had a value of 0.86. The analysis showed that the top three manufacturers need to reduce RTS size in accordance with DRS, which is a sub-group of six companies. Moreover, the operational efficiency of all forwarding companies should be improved and expanded to achieve the appropriate scale according to the IRS. In addition, the SBM-DEA model was applied to the top 15 forwarding companies to measure the inefficiency of inputs in 2014, based on capital, overall number of employees, and operating expense, which require reductions of 30%, 36%, and 19%, respectively. Such reductions are apparently capable of improving the current inefficiency. Forwarding companies operating in the employee’s ability to significantly influence operating revenue inefficiency requires effective management of human resources identified areas, and in terms of non-operating expenses were also able to verify the effective accounts receivable management and foreign currency transactions management is required. As this study considered the sales of only the top 15 companies, the operational efficiency of small and medium-sized forwarding companies was not analyzed. Moreover, the network of partnerships and the agency contracts on which the sales are based were not considered. In the future, variables such as employee careers, cargo throughput, number of network transactions, and number of large customers, which reflect the characteristics of forwarding companies, should be examined. Additional research should also be conducted to account for the factors influencing the establishment of long-term contracts. In addition, we need to grasp each enterprise``s internal management capabilities and additional variables that affect the management efficiency and are in need of systematic and practical research."

A 3-level factorial design was employed to formulate the experimental runs and to evaluate the effect of two independent variables such as the concentration of PVA and HPMC on characteristics of cryogel such as bioadhesive strength (BS) and in vitro drug release (dependent variables). Response surface plots such as contour and 3D plots were generated by the Design Expert software to analyze the effect of independent variables on dependent variables. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies confirmed the absence of interaction between DZ and polymers. Among various models generated by the software, quadratic model was found to be best fit for both the responses. Both the formulation factors influenced BS synergistically.

roles of steroid receptor coactivator-3 and ttf-1 in lung development and lung cancer,2015,"['CCSP', 'lung cancer', 'lung development', 'SRC-3', 'TTF-1']","Steroid Receptor Coactivator (SRC)는 스테로이드 수용체 전사 활성화 단백질로, 이중에서 SRC-3는 많은 종류의 종양과 관련하여 연구되었다. 그러나 현재 배아에서의 폐의 분화와 폐암 진행과정에서 SRC-3의 기능적 역할에 대한 연구는 제한적이다. 본 연구는 SRC-3가 생쥐 배아의 폐 분화과정에서 기관지와 폐포의 분화에 중요한 역할을 함을 보여준다. 높은 레벨의 SRC-3 유전자 발현이 클라라 세포와 type II 세포에서 배아발달 말기 시기인 E17.5- E18.5에서 관찰되었으며, 성체 생쥐의 폐에서도 클라라 세포와 type II 세포에서 SRC-3 유전자 발현이 관찰되었다. SRC-3의 폐암에서의 역할을 연구하기 위하여 클라라 세포 특이적 폐암 생쥐 모델을 이용하여 관찰한 결과, SRC-3 잡종 생쥐의 폐와 클라라 세포 특이적 종양 생쥐의 폐에서 TTF-1 유전자와 SRC-3 유전자는 공동 발현되었다. 위 모델에서 TTF-1 유전자 발현은 클라라 세포 유래 종양부위와 다발성 선암 영역에서 선명하게 관찰되었지만, SRC-3 유전자 발현은 다발성 선암 부위에서는 관찰되지 않았다. 이 결과로 SRC-3가 폐암 진행과정 중 침윤성에는 중요한 역할을 수행하지 않음을 확인하였다. SRC-3와 TTF-1의 폐암에서 역할을 클라라 세포 특이적 암 세포주인 mtCC 세포를 사용하여 transient transfection 분석한 결과, TTF-1는 클라라 세포 특이적 단백질인 CCSP 유전자 발현을 현저하게 활성화하였으나, SRC-3는 CCSP 유전자 발현의 활성화에 중요하게 관여하지 않음을 확인하였다. 이 결과는 SRC-3가 폐암 진행에 필수적인 역할을 수행하는 단백질이 아님을 제시한다. 결론적으로, SRC-3는 생쥐 배아와 성체 생쥐에서 기관지와 폐포의 분화에 중요한 역할을 수행하지만, 클라라 세포 유래의 폐암 진행과정에서는 SRC-3는 중요한 역할을 수행하지 않는다.","Steroid receptor coactivators (SRC) are transcriptional coactivators. Among SRCs, SRC-3 is the most studied in relation to different types of tumors. However, the role of SRC-3 in early lung development and lung cancer has not been well studied. The expression profiles of SRC-3 showed that SRC-3 contributed to bronchial and alveolar development in embryonic lung development. SRC-3 was strongly expressed in Clara cells and type II alveolar cells during fetal lung development (E17.5- E18.5), and SRC-3 was expressed in both cell types in the adult lung. TTF-1 was expressed in the lungs of heterozygote SRC-3 mice and Clara cell-specific-CCSP-TAg tumor mice, along with SRC-3 expression. The expression of TTF-1 was localized at transformed Clara cells and multifocal adenocarcinomas in lung cancer mice. However, SRC-3 was not expressed in the multifocal adenocarcinomas, suggesting that SRC-3 might not be involved in the invasiveness of lung cancer. Cotransfection of TTF-1 in Clara cell-specific mtCC cell lines resulted in significant activation of CCSP expression. However, cotransfection of SRC-3 had no significant effects on transient transfection. These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that SRC-3 does not play a significant role in lung tumor progression. In conclusion, SRC-3 is involved in bronchial and alveolar development in fetal and adult lungs, but it does not play an important role in the progression of Clara cell-derived lung cancer."
on the second order effect of the springing response of large blunt ship,2015,"['Springing', 'Higher order spectral analysis', 'Cross bispectrum', 'Quadratic transfer function', 'Volterra series']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The springing response of a large blunt ship was considered to be influenced by a second order interaction between the incoming irregular wave and the blunt geometry of the forebody of the ship. Little efforts have been made to simulate this complicated fluid-structure interaction phenomenon under irregular waves considering the second order effect; hence, the above mentioned premise still remains unproven. In this paper, efforts were made to quantify the second order effect between the wave and vibrating flexible ship structure by analyzing the experimental data obtained through the model basin test of the scaled-segmented model of a large blunt ship. To achieve this goal, the measured vertical bending moment and the wave elevation time history were analyzed using a higher order spectral analysis technique, where the quadratic interaction between the excitation and response was captured by the cross bispectrum of two randomly oscillating variables. The nonlinear response of the vibrating hull was expressed in terms of a quadratic Volterra series assuming that the wave excitation is Gaussian. The Volterra series was then orthogonalized using Barrett’s procedure to remove the interference between the kernels of different orders. Both the linear and quadratic transfer functions of the given system were then derived based on a Fourier transform of the orthogonalized Volterra series. Finally, the response was decomposed into a linear and quadratic part to determine the contribution of the second order effect using the obtained linear and quadratic transfer functions of the system, combined with the given wave spectrum used in the experiment. The contribution of the second order effect on the springing response of the analyzed ship was almost comparable to the linear one in terms of its peak power near the resonance frequency."

In particular, power and time allocations are jointly optimized with the target of energy efficiency under the resource-limited constraints. Different from previous studies on the power-time tradeoff, we consider a multi-server case where the concurrent serving users are quantitatively restricted. Therefore user selection is investigated accompanying the resource allocation, making the power-time tradeoff occur not only between the users in the same server but also in different servers. The complex multivariate optimization problem can be modeled as a variant of 2-Dimension Bin Packing Problem (V2D-BPP), which is a joint non-linear and integer programming problem. Though we use state decomposition model to transform it into a convex optimization problem, the variables are still coupled. Therefore, we propose an Iterative Dual Optimization (IDO) algorithm to obtain its optimal solution. Simulations show that the joint multi-resource allocation algorithm outperforms two existing non-joint algorithms from the perspective of energy efficiency."

However it confronted with many problems such as mass unemployment, environmental pollution, urban decline, and social conflicts due to the technical development and structural changes of the world economy since 1960s. The IBA Emscher park project was an attempt to meet such problems, which attracts attention from the whole world for its oranization, goals, participation of the citizens, reuse of industrial heritage. Its main goals as an urban regeneration project were sustainability, ecology, transformation of the economy and social integration. The Emscher park project as an urban regeneration was estimated to have created a new model for urban regeneration through the building of landscape parks and techno parks by conservation and reuse of industrial heritage, renaturalization of the contaminated Emscher river system, and revitalization of culture and arts in everyday life of the citizens. Its success lies primarily in the cooperation and participation of all involved subjects like the local governments, experts groups, civil society and citizens. It can have meaningfull implications for Korean practice of urban regeneration through its characteristics of a longterm and holistic approach to the urban problems, democratic participation of citizens, conservation and reuse of the industrial heritage, and measures for promoting of identity and pride of the region."
the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway regulates the development of airway remodeling in patients with asthma,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Airway remodeling is a key characteristic of chronic asthma, particularly in patients with a fixed airflow limitation. The mechanisms underlying airway remodeling are poorly understood, and no therapeutic option is available. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including fibrosis and smooth muscle hypertrophy. In this study, we investigated the roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in airway remodeling in patients with asthma. Wnt7a mRNA expression was prominent in induced sputum from patients with asthma compared with that from healthy controls. Next, we induced a chronic asthma mouse model with airway remodeling features, including subepithelial fibrosis and airway smooth muscle hyperplasia. Higher expression of Wnt family proteins and β-catenin was detected in the lung tissue of mice with chronic asthma compared to control mice. Blocking β-catenin expression with a specific siRNA attenuated airway inflammation and airway remodeling. Decreased subepithelial fibrosis and collagen accumulation in the β-catenin siRNA-treated mice was accompanied by reduced expression of transforming growth factor-β. We further showed that suppressing β-catenin in the chronic asthma model inhibited smooth muscle hyperplasia by downregulating the tenascin C/platelet-derived growth factor receptor pathway. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is highly expressed and regulates the development of airway remodeling in chronic asthma.</P>"
stem cell therapy for alzheimer’s disease and related disorders: current status and future perspectives,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"Underlying cognitive declines in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are the result of neuron and neuronal process losses due to a wide range of factors. To date, all efforts to develop therapies that target specific AD-related pathways have failed in late-stage human trials. As a result, an emerging consensus in the field is that treatment of AD patients with currently available drug candidates might come too late, likely as a result of significant neuronal loss in the brain. In this regard, cell-replacement therapies, such as human embryonic stem cell- or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cells, hold potential for treating AD patients. With the advent of stem cell technologies and the ability to transform these cells into different types of central nervous system neurons and glial cells, some success in stem cell therapy has been reported in animal models of AD. However, many more steps remain before stem cell therapies will be clinically feasible for AD and related disorders in humans. In this review, we will discuss current research advances in AD pathogenesis and stem cell technologies; additionally, the potential challenges and strategies for using cell-based therapies for AD and related disorders will be discussed."

However, the specific role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in this process remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that NPY deficient mice have significantly reduced HSC numbers and impaired bone marrow regeneration due to apoptotic destruction of SNS fibers and/or endothelial cells. Moreover, NPY treatment prevented bone marrow impairments in a mouse model of chemotherapy- induced SNS injury, while conditional knockout mice lacking the Y1 receptor in macrophages did not restore bone marrow dysfunction in spite of NPY injection. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) secreted by NPY-mediated Y1 receptor stimulation in macrophages plays a key role in neuroprotection and HSC survival in the bone marrow. Therefore, this study reveals a new role of NPY in bone marrow HSC microenvironment, and provides an insight into the therapeutic application of this neuropeptide.

With the assumption that GCs are generally old, GC colors have been used as a proxy for GC metallicities. Bimodal color distributions of GCs observed in most large galaxies have, for decades, been interpreted as bimodal metallicity distributions, indicating the presence of two populations within a galaxy. However, the conventional view has been challenged by a new theory that non-linear GC color-metallicity relations can cause a bimodal color distribution even from a single-peaked metallicity distribution. Using photometric and spectroscopic data of NGC 5128 GCs in combination with stellar population simulation models, we examine the effect of non-linearity in GC color-metallicity relations on transformation of the color distributions into the metallicity distributions. Although in some colors offsets are present between observations and models for the color-metallicity relations, their overall shape agrees well for various colors. After the offsets are corrected, the observed spectroscopic metallicity distribution is well reproduced via modeled color-metallicity relations from various color distributions having different morphologies. We discuss the implications of our results."

Spenser’s Ovidian digressions have long been treated as classicizing ornaments or decorative deviations from the main narrative of The Faerie Queene. However, Spenser uses these engagements with Ovidian digression to illuminate the means toward the allegorized virtues that the titular knights in each book of The Faerie Queene are struggling to achieve. In the Renaissance, when Spenser was writing, Ovid’s Metamorphoses was regarded as a romance, particularly with regard to its proliferating plots and characters and its narrative use of entrelacement and digressions. Contemporary readers recognized this multiplicity and variety as the source of poetic pleasure, and contemporary writers looked to Ovid as a poetic model to emulate. Drawing on Renaissance imitation theory, Spenser incorporates Ovid’s Metamorphoses into his own epic-romance, The Faerie Queene, simultaneously borrowing and transforming Ovidian digressions, both replicating Ovid’s art and rewriting it in moral terms. For example, Spenser actively expands the Ovidian trope of the labyrinth and complicating its aesthetic and moral implications through the Wandering Wood, itself a form of Ovidian digression. It is important, I argue, to recognize the Wandering Wood as a complex rhetorical space Spenser constructs with varying Ovidian allusions. In this space, Redcrosse faces a trial through which his reading ability is put to the test. The wisdom and spiritual maturity of Redcross Knight must be earned on the digressive way through error."

Its widespread use is explained by its simplicity and modest data requirements; it does not require primary data collection and its results are also relatively easy to assess and interpret. Since exports are a vital factor in the overall development of a port, some means of quantitatively assessing export changes must be developed. If shifts in exports can be isolated, they can be used to explain partially structural transformations in ports and to provide insight into possible future direction for port development. This study, therefore, uses a shift-share technique to isolate the various factors associated with export changes. The traditional shift-share model partitions the change of exports in a port into three effects: the national growth effect, the industrial mix effect and the regional share effect. The national growth effect attempts measure the change in exports in a port that would have occurred if its exports had grown at precisely the same rate as the national average. Hence, if a port grows at the same rate as the national average, it does not possess any comparative advantage in terms of resource endowments or human capital. The industrial mix effect associates the differential growth rate in exports between the region in question and the nation as a whole with the overall strengths or weaknesses of the relevant export sectors. Ideally, it is expected that a large proportion of a port’s exports should be concentrated in faster-growing industries. The regional share effect accounts for the differential change between a port and the nation. The regional share effect portrays the competitive position of a port in relation to the rest of the port. For instance, an export component that is growing faster in a port than its counterparts in the nation as a whole will add to the port’s overall growth relative to that of the nation, while a slower-growing component will bring forth an opposite effect. The export data used in this study are obtained from the Korea International Trade Association and consist of exports by two ports of 20 individual products. The particular product categories studied are at three-digit MTI (Ministry of Trade and Industry) level of disaggregation. The national growth effect for synthetic resin and steel plate-rolled products accounted for about 96 percent and 102 percent respectively of the increase in exports of Gwangyang Port or 3,685 and 4,226 million dollars respectively during the period under analysis. The fact that the industrial mix effects of the two products were negative-at 486 and 1,191 million dollars, respectively-can be interpreted to mean that Gwangyang Port’s main export products were growing slowly rather than rapidly. The regional share effects of the two products did not explain a large proportion of the change-at about 16 percent and 27 percent, respectively. The greatest regional share impact was in the steel plate-rolled product sector. The national growth effect of the automobile industry accounted for about 99 percent of the increase in export of Incheon Port or 3,378 million dollars, while that for the flat panel display only explained 1 percent or 100 million dollars. The regional share effect of flat panel display, however, explained a very large percentage of the change-88 percent or 12,238 million dollars-compared with automobiles, at 46 percent or 1,585 million dollars. The industrial mix effect of the two products was negative or explained only a small portion of the change."

In this report, we describe experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations carried out to investigate the complex reduction pathway of carbon tetrachloride (CT) on a vivianite (Fe<SUP>II</SUP><SUB>3</SUB>(PO<SUB>4</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>·8H<SUB>2</SUB>O) surface. Our results indicate that chloroform (HCCl<SUB>3</SUB>) and formate are the primary transformation products. The experimental results reveal that the reduction kinetics of CCl<SUB>4</SUB> can be dramatically accelerated as the pH is increased from 3 to 11. On the basis of the DFT calculations, we found that HCCl<SUB>3</SUB> can be formed by <SUP>•</SUP>CCl<SUB>3</SUB> and :CCl<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>–</SUP>* on a deprotonated vivianite surface (an adsorbate on vivianite is denoted using an asterisk). In addition, :CCl<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>–</SUP>* can be nonreductively dechlorinated to form :CCl<SUB>2</SUB>* followed by sequential nucleophilic attack by OH<SUP>–</SUP>*, resulting in the formation of :CCl(OH)* and :C(OH)<SUB>2</SUB>*, which are responsible for production of CO and formate, respectively. The results obtained from this study can facilitate the modeling of systems of other halogenated species and minerals, which will provide fundamental insight into their corresponding reaction mechanisms.</P><P><B>Graphic Abstract</B><IMG SRC='http://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcafh/2015/jpcafh.2015.119.issue-22/acs.jpca.5b01885/production/images/medium/jp-2015-018852_0007.gif'></P><P><A href='http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jp5b01885'>ACS Electronic Supporting Info</A></P>"
디오니시오스의 로마기원론 : 제정 초 그리스 지식인의 로마제국관,2015,"['디오니시오스', 'Dionysius of Halicarnassus', '『로마고대사』', 'Romaike Archaiologia', '아우구스투스', 'Augustus', '로물루스', 'Romulus', '아이네아스', 'Aeneas']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The canonical tradition on Rome’s origin had been firmly established by the age of Augustus. According to the orthodox tale, the Romans derived from Trojan refugees under the leadership of Aeneas. The wandering Trojans headed west and eventually reached the land of Italy after bearing various hardships. The descendants of Aeneas made the founding of Rome effective via Lavinium and Alba Longa. That legend was enshrined in Virgil's Aeneid. In the epic, Greek influence on Roman ancestry was eliminated by providing Italian origins for Dardanus, the common ancestor of Trojans and Latini.The enthusiasm of Augustus for the Trojan legend is well known. One could cite, for example, Augustus’ testified interest in the Aeneid, the Aeneas panel on the Ara Pacis, or his own claim to Trojan descent in the Forum Augustum. Caesar tried to transform Aeneas from a symbol of ethnic identity to the progenitor of the Julii, and Augustus cemented the transformation through state monuments and literary productions of contemporary writers.However, the Trojan legend did not inspire all of the ancients. Dionysius of Halicarnassus in Augustan Rome, for example, believed that the Trojans were Greek. According to Dionysius’ Romaike Archaiologia Rome was a Greek city from its very beginnings. This is what Dionysius is concerned to prove throughout his first book of the Romaike Archaiologia. Every element which went into making up the early population of Rome was of Greek extraction. Italy was peopled with successive bands of Greek immigrants-Aborigines, Pelasgians, Arcadians, the followers of Heracles and the Trojans of Aeneas.The insistence on the Greek origin of Rome is not confined to the existence of a blood relationship between Greeks and Romans. In addition to establishing the shared kinship, Dionysius seeks to prove that many Roman social and political institutions are derived from Greek practices. Rome's Greekness is evident in Dionysius' account of the founding of Rome's constitution in the second book. The pattern of Roman behavior in Romaike Archaiologia goes back to one paradigm : Romulus' constitution.Dionysius' Romulus not only adopted Greek models but also improved them. Dionysius’ definition of Roman identity, as stated above, is at variance with the dominant ideology expounded by Augustan propaganda and Virgil’s Aeneid. This discrepancy is not an indicator of an opposition to Augustus' political program. Although his work may be far removed from simple flattery, it cannot be denied that he was favorably disposed toward Rome. Dionysius’ Romaike Archaiologia provides a strategy to make Roman power acceptable to the Greeks. But while acknowledging the impact of Roman power, any form of dominance needs to be justified in Greek terms in order to be acceptable. Dionysius uses the Greek-Barbarian dichotomy repeatedly and fits the Romans into the dichotomy."

Problems related to execution of ArdenML are the curly braces problem and the compiler problem, which may be resolved by the introduction of XML-based techniques. This study was aimed at develop an ArdenML based XSLT conforming to HL7 standard. Methods: There were several structural differences in three approaches: Arden Syntax is category; ArdenML is tag; and Visual Basic is comment, function, events, class, and procedure. XSLT was developed by analyzing three approaches. Based on XSLT, ArdenML was translated into Visual Basic and the interface module was developed to allow communicating with legacy systems. Results: Most of the CDSS are independently developed and run, to require reentry of rules. But this system makes it easier to interface with the existing systems simply by translating or compiling rules. Two hundred sixty five of the 285 rules were showed the success after compiling, and 6 errors for the operater query, 14 warnings related to data type were resolved by data re-modeling. Conclusions: ArdenML has been converted into executable files using standard transforms written in the eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) in visual basic language. Development of Arden Syntax compiler requires not only a lot of time and efforts, but also reorganization of existing systems according to the MLM. It also has curly brace problem and problem of requiring additional compiler."

Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was employed as a silicon source, which was rapidly hydrolyzed and reacted with the amine groups of PAH to form spherical SiO2 nanoparticles (PAH-Si). Subsequently, Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> ions reacted with the silicate anions produced during the dissolution of SiO2 in basic media, leading to the formation of the highly porous 3D networks of PAH-CS that were synthesized only under optimized reaction conditions. The PAH-CS containing an excess of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> and NH3<SUP>+</SUP> enriched the surfaces with a very high cationic charge (<I>ζ</I> = +65.66 mV)and resulted in an extremely high loading capacity for anionic drugs and proteins. Ibuprofen (IBU) and FITC-labeled bovine albumin (FITC-Albumin) were chosen as a model drug and model protein, respectively, to test the loading and delivery efficiencies of the PAH-CS carriers. The ultrahigh drug loading capacities (DLC) and their release patterns were investigated under controlled pH conditions. Strikingly, the highest DLC reported to date (IBU or FITC-Albumin/carrier (3.35 g or 1 g g<SUP>−1</SUP>) was achieved in this work. The PAH-CS had no cytotoxic effect on osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cell lines evaluated by the LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase) assay in supernatant medium. Furthermore, the PAH-CS carriers could be entirely transformed to hydroxyapatite after releasing the drug in simulated body fluid (SBF), indicating good bioactivity and biodegradability of the PAH-CS carriers.</P>"

A formal verification of PLC program could be a best way to check all possible fault situation. Tracing the history of the study on formal verification, we found three problems, the first is that a formal representation of PLC control system is incomplete, the second is a state explosion problem and the third is that the verification result is difficult to use for the correction of control program.

Mouvement artistique ne dans le courant de la Reforme du XVIe siecle, le baroque contient par nature deux aspects apparemment contrastes, voire contradictoires. En effet, il est a la fois une esthetique de la Contre-Reforme qui consiste a promouvoir des themes religieux par l’exageration du mouvement, la surcharge decorative, les effets dramatiques, l’exuberance et la grandeur parfois pompeuse ainsi qu``une prise de conscience de la condition humaine qui est d``une impuissance totale, un neant, face a un Dieu omnipresent mais cache, entierement maitre du destin des hommes. Or, il n``est pas difficile de relever dans le cas de Racine ce double caractere du baroque. D``une part, Racine, en tant qu``historiographe et courtisan du roi, consacre son genie litteraire a construire le Siecle de Louis le Grand et a l``immortaliser pour l``eternite. Ceci tient a l``aspect du courant baroque de la Contre-Reforme qui se transforme au XVIIe siecle en France en un outil pour la promotion de la monarchie absolue. D``autre part, Racine ne manque pas de representer avec excellence la sensibilite tragique de l``homme baroque a travers ses personnages, plus particulierement celui de Phedre. Cette heroine tragique, tout en vivant pleinement le conflit entre passion et raison sans fin, nous fournit un modele de l``homme baroque qui assume avec courage la condition tragique humaine dans le monde d``ici-bas.

Even though 2 Baruch proposes the eschatological restoration of the Temple in the future as in other apocalyptic traditions represented by 1 Enoch and 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch does not present any other entity to replace the destroyed Temple, such as the faithful community, messianic interpretation, the study of the Torah and acts of loving-kindness.Instead, in following the same seven-fold literary structure of 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch suggests its own theological intention different from that of 4 Ezra. Baruch functions as a role model who transforms himself from skeptic to consoler in the process of praying, having dialogue with God, receiving visions and meeting the people in the fourth (chaps.21-34), fifth (chaps. 35-47) and sixth part (chaps. 48-77) repeatedly.With the help of the pattern, the author intends his audience to follow Baruch’s gradual change so that they can be changed to go out to console others as Baruch did. In each speech of the three meetings with the people (chaps. 31-34, 44-47, 77), Baruch emphasizes the observance of the Torah (32:1, 44:3, 7, 46:5, 77:15-16).

Generally, his first transformation is considered much more valuable than the second, because what the hero contradicts clearly his former thoughts gives the impression that the end of the work is trivial and unworthy. But Renè Girard, a Christian critic, interprets the two changes respectively as an imitation of the mediator of desire, and as a reconciliation between the man and the sacred. It is possible to be reconciled by giving up human desire and pride. It is worth stressing the importance of reconciliation in Christianism. Meanwhile, some heroes of Mario Benedetti’s works don’t have to change a lot, because they are mature and real beings, and convinced that revolution is possible. Therefore they don’t have a significant transformation, neither change of their mind, nor religious conversion. They are militant models of humanism which is based on pride of human beings. It is true that there is a great difference between Christianism and Humanism, but the two are not always incompatible. Frequently they influence each other and share some qualities. Don Quixote and the heroes of Benedetti coincide specifically in two points: both suffer defeats in the surrounding reality, but they don""t stop being good. Goodness is a precious virtue for a Christian as well as for a non-Christian humanist."

기후변화로 인한 고온환경 근로자의 작업역량 저하 추정과 공간적 군집 파악,2015,"['작업역량', '기후변화', 'WBGT', '취약직종', 'Work Capacity', 'Climate Change', 'WBGT', 'Vulnerable Occupation']","기후변화로 인한 영향과 피해가 지속적으로 증가하고 있으며, 피해의 강도와 빈도도 상이하게 변화하고 있는 추세이다. 점차적으로 증가하는 기온 상승은 실내·외의 열 부하를 증가시키고 있으며, 이는 업무에 종사하는 근로자의 근로환경 악화와 건강의 위협, 생산성을 저하시키는 결과를 가져온다. 또한 기후변화는 도시의 지속가능성에 위협이 되는 중요한 외생요인으로 작용한다. 공간적 차원에서 기후변화는 지속적인 기온상승으로 인해 근로자의 노동생산성을 저하시킬 수 있으며 도시 및 지역의 생산성(productivity)에 영향을 줄 수있다. 도시 및 지역의 지속가능성은 그 지역의 고용구조와 밀접한 관련성이 있다. 어떠한 직종이 그 지역의 기반을 구성하고 있으며 구조를 지니고 있는지는 외부 충격에 대한 회복력의 측면에서 중요하다. 이러한 관점에서 기후변화로 인한 근로자의 고온노출은 직접적으로 근로자의 건강, 작업역량 저하를 야기할 수 있으며, 간접적으로 지역적 차원에서 고용구조의 변화, 지역기반산업의 피해로 전이될 수 있다. 본 연구에서는 지속적으로 증가하는 기온 상승에 따른 근로자의 체감온도를 기상학적 관점에서 추정하고, 지역별 공간적 클러스터의 작업역량(work capacity)의 변화 정도를 추정하고자 하였다. 먼저, 미래기후예측모델인 RCP시나리오 8.5를 기준으로 기온, 습도, 풍속, 수증기압 등 기후인자의 자료를 활용하여 산업안전분야에서 제시되는 WBGT(Wet Bulb Globe Temperature)를 기상학적 측면에서 체감온도지수로 변환하였다. 또한, 고온작업환경에서 1시간당 작업효율을 나타내는 Watts에 대해 국내, 국제기관에서 제시하는 고온노출 기준과 비교하고, 각 지역의 고용구조별 기후변화로 인한 기온상승의 영향이 주는 작업역량 저하를 추정하였다. 열 피로(heat stress)와 관련하여 고온환경의 노출로 인해 근로자의 작업부하를 가중시키는 요인을 환경적 요인과 민감도 요인으로 구분하고 각 요인의 변수를 선정하였으며, 한국근로환경조사(Korean Working Conditions Survey, KWCS)의 기초 데이터를 토대로 근로자의 신체적 부하 정도를 추정하였다. 추정된 신체적부하 정도에 따라 Watts의 카테고리를 200~500W로 분류하고, Watts에 해당하는 직종군을 한국표준직업분류(Korean Standard Classification of Occupations, KSCO)의 147개 직종분류의 환경적 요인, 민감도 요인의 부하 정도와 대비하여 직종을 분류하였다. 분류된 직종은 Watts에 따라 비선형 관계모형을 통해 230개 지역별로 2010~2050년까지 작업역량의 저하 정도를 추정하고 인구주택총조사 자료(2010)를 활용하여 지역별 해당 Watts의 종사자비율을 기초로 공간적 클러스터로 패턴을 파악하였다. 분석 결과, RCP시나리오에 따른 WBGT의 변화는 2020년에 한반도의 서남지역과 남부내륙지역을 중심으로 체감온도가 높게 나타나나 2050년에는 동쪽 산간지역(강원도) 일부를 제외하고 거의 전 지역에서 그 수준이 높게 나타났다. 결과적으로 이는 2020~2050년의 분석기간 동안 32.1℃ 이상의 기온이 지속적으로 상승하고 있으며, 야외근로 활동에 대한 기준보다 그 범위가 확대되고 있음을 알 수 있다. 또한, Watts별로 200W의 종사자는 2020년의 작업역량에 저하가 거의 없으나 2050년으로 갈수록 작업역량이 감소하는 추세로 나타났다. 300W의 종사자는 동북부 산간지역과 내륙산간지역 일부(중앙지역)를 제외하고 50% 이상의 작업역량 저하로 이어질 것으로 전망한다. 400W는 300W와 유사한 패턴을 보이는 것으로 나타났다. 특히 500W에 종사하는 근로자는 지속적인 기온상승으로 체감온도가 급격히 증가하며, 동북부의 고산지대 일부를 제외하고 80%의 작업역량 저하가 예상되는데, 이는 지역의 근로자뿐만 아니라 지역경제의 영향으로 전이될 수 있다. 또한, 인구주택총조사자료를 기준으로 종사자 비율을 판단하여 볼 때, 300~500W의 종사자가 전체 근로자의 13%로 근로자의 작업역량 저하는 지역의 기반산업에 상당한 영향을 미칠 가능성이 있다. 작업역량이 갖는 의미가 1시간당 근로할 수 있는 작업의 한계로 그 의미를 해석할 수 있기 때문에, 작업역량의 저하는 실질적으로 1시간 작업 대비 휴식시간의 시간비가 더 증가할수 있음을 의미하고, 결국 지역생산성의 감소로 이어질 수 있다. 또한, 지역의 공간적 클러스터 패턴을 파악한 결과, 2020년 동남내륙지역의 작업역량이 집중적으로 감소하는 패턴을 보이며, 2030년 남서지역에서 2050년 중부지역까지 확산되는 경향을 보였다. HH(high-high)지역은 고온노출 위험 직종이 많아 기후변화에 따른 지역의 생산성 저하와 직결될 수 있다. 본 연구에서 제시된 시사점은 개별 근로자의 생산성과 근로환경 문제, 지역산업구조 및 발전전략 등 기후변화 적응의 차원에서 근로자의 고온노출 대처방안이 강구되어야 한다는 점이다. 실질적으로 RCP 8.5 시나리오의 WBGT가 2.0~5.2℃ 이상의 증가를 보이고 있다는 점에서 6~8월에 나타나는 체감온도의 증가는 고온노출 및 야외 근로자의 정상적인 근무가 어려운 상태로 나타날 수 있으며, 이에 대한 산업안전보건 등의 관계법령에서 기후변화에 대한 선제적인 대응과 기준의 마련이 요구된다. 또한, 지역적 관점에서 산업구조의 변화를 가져올 수 있으며, 기반산업이 이전될 가능성이 높을 것이다. 이러한 현상에 대해 사전적으로 대응하기 위해서는 지역산업과 직종 구성에 대한 조사, 영향에 대한 가능성을 지역 단위에서 추가적으로 파악할 필요가 있으며, 이를 기반한 도시 및 지역에서 기후변화에 회복력 있는 안정적인 직종의 구조를 확보하기 위한 계획과 중·장기적 구조 개선 등이 면밀하게 고려되어야 할 것이다.","Climate change is an important factor in the future of local and regional economies. It transforms basic circumstances such as life patterns, working conditions, and industries. In particular, the rise in temperature will bring various impacts to individual labor, since blue-collar workers are vulnerable to heat stress. As the effects of climate change become greater, more exposure to heat stress is expected, which will damage employees’ work capacity. Work capacity means each individual’s work efficiency per hour. The work capacity of labor is a crucial element of labor productivity and regional economies, considering the climate change impact. This means that additional time or labor will be needed to produce the same thing in occupations vulnerable to heat stress. This study estimates the future work capacity of RCP 8.5 scenarios, and discusses their regional effects from the perspective of Korea’s occupational structures. The wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is used to analyze the relationship between sensory temperature and work capacity. To estimate the work capacity of each occupational group, we used the exposure of physical working risks in the Korea Working Conditions Survey. The work capacity of each occupational group is classified into five categories, from 200 to 500 watts in relation to the aspects of “hard-working” and “high exposure to heat stress.” The results showed that 52 vocations are at risk for heat stress, such as machine operators and elementary laborers in the construction, welding, metal, and mining industries. The loss in work based on wattage due to WBGT changes (a heat stress index) is more pronounced in jobs with a high risk of heat exposure. The results indicate loss in work capacity according to temperature increases, independent of the actual number of employees. At 200w, work capacity is predicted to change minimally by 2020. However, by 2050, changes will be observed in areas with dramatic WBGT increases. At 300w, over 50% of work capacity loss is predicted, with the exclusion of some parts of the northeastern and inland (central region) mountainous areas. At 400w, a pattern similar to that of 300w is observed, though the places with a significant loss in work capacity appear to be more widely distributed. At 500w, over 80% of work capacity loss is observed outside of high-altitude, mountainous zones in the northeast. The spatial clusters of diminished work capacity appear in Korea’s southeast and southwest. The High-High clusters are expected to extend spatial scope to neighboring areas. Work capacity means each individual’s work efficiency per hour. The work capacity of labor is a factor in labor productivity and regional economies, considering the climate change impact. This means that additional time or labor will be needed to produce the same thing in vocations vulnerable to heat stress. This study suggests two policy implications for climate change adaptation: labor productivity during heat stress, and the need to diversify regional development strategies. The impact of heat stress on labor can cause health and safety problems. Institutional improvements in the work environment are needed for at-risk jobs. In addition, the concentrated regions of diminished work capacity are likely to experience an outflow of firms, skilled labor, and capital; thus, local governments must begin to change the industry structures and diversify the jobs in such regions. These results suggest the need for adaptation policies in terms of regional development strategies and labor safety."

The objective of this paper is to examine whether the process of organizational change in implementing the environmental and quality standards can act as a driving force for sustainable development (SD) and value creation and role of ISO26000 as ―facilitator” for reporting. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a qualitative research approach, using multiple case studies to undertake an analysis of the role of ISO26000 and the drive to go beyond for sustainable service business in different contexts of public transit services. Two case studies of regional public transit services, one from Sweden - Stockholm city region, and France - Paris city region are selected. Findings - The paper demonstrates that ―Beyond ISO26000”, as driving force for CSR and Quality Management towards co-creating value, contributes to securing sustainable service business embedded on social and environmental perspectives and governance issues. It has been shown this based on ―why and how” - by understanding how ―facilitating and unpredictability” are shaping business models to secure sustainable service business. The study has also shown ―shared responsibility” is essential for understanding that environment quality standards and reporting CSR are not merely systems of command and control, but are essential for resource integration to secure sustainable service business development. Research limitations/implications - The study provides useful insights into the need to go beyond successful adoption of ISO26000 as an active tool for SD and value creation. Future research in this area should focus on generalizing the present findings to securing sustainable service business embedded on social and environmental perspectives and governance issues in other empirical settings and conceptualization. Originality/value - The paper makes an original contribution to the on-going discussions on quality and environment management standards and service research. In service research, the main theoretical challenges of understanding and integrating value co-creation and sustainable development as a transformative service research thinking."
다원성과 통합성의 조화 -고려사회와 라이프니츠의 조화론을 중심으로-,2015,"['다원주의', '통합성', '고려사회', '라이프니츠', '조화', 'pluralism', 'unity', 'Koryo dynasty', 'Leibniz', 'harmony']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The main purpose of this paper is to discuss the ways of social management by considering Koryo Dynasty which is a plural society with the framework of Leibniz’s harmony theory. Leibniz’s philosophical ideas and the sociological tendency of Koryo Dynasty are historically not in any relationship with each other and each is comprised of its own heterogeneous areas. However, they share some meaningful structural similarity in respect that they both distinguishingly center on the harmony between pluralism and unity. It is noticeable for Koryo Dynasty to sustain a long period of stable prosperity just as pluralism and unity in it was in harmony and balanced, whereas it was insecurely disintegrated when the gap between them was critically increasing. In this perspective, this paper intends to explore the way of acquiring the stability of a society by taking a close look at the history through the very philosophical thought, which is considered as the most systematic theory for the harmony of pluralism and unity. Pluralism has a twofold potential with regard to social management. On the one hand, the spread of pluralism, if it is accompanied by solid integration, constitutes a key mechanism to contribute to the stability and development of a society. What makes it possible is in the way that central and local forces hold the relative autonomy through an adequate tension between them. On the other hand, in case of collapsing the harmony between pluralism and unity, thereby, the society inevitably experiences the transformation of its structure, and, further, the remaining society breaks down or is replaced by other types of society. Koryo Dynasty originally started as a pluralistic social structure, though, its rise and fall seems to have been determined by whether it successfully maintained the balance between pluralism and unity or not. If so, we are able to reach a possible and crucial lesson in the consideration of Koryo dynasty with the framework of Leibniz’s harmony theory, namely, that we can secure a stable society when timely settling the societal structural system which can provide the balance of pluralism and unity. In this regard, this paper focuses largely on three parts as follows. First, in philosophical and sociological perspective, it makes a general overview of pluralism. Second, it specifically determines the Leibniz’s concept of pluralism in his philosophical thought. Finally, it derives some meaningful ways when it comes to social management by comparatively considering both the Leibniz’s harmony model of pluralism and unity and Koryo Dynasty’s pluralism."

Actually he intended the radical release from being forced to act a role. Spontaneity and creativity are the propelling forces in human progress.Brecht characterized his Lehrstück 『Die Maßnahme』 as his intended model for future theatre. Brecht considered it as the only way to get access to ‘Maßnahme‘ to participate actively in the play.

The representative case, pangu air courtyard, aims to satisfy people’s special requirements for villas of high price, so there are many modern facilities added and the space integrating traditional elements with modern convenience forms. In addition, both the housetops are connected and the shape of courtyard forms, which are called “Sahap-won-like”. Glass house tops are added to some “Sahap-won-like”, forming interior courtyard space, which settles some spatial problems of the original Sahap-won. “Sahap-won-like” provide good schemes to settle problems brought by spatial deficiency of modern residences, which apply many design elements of Beijing Sahap-won in design and in architecture, add many modern facilities in transformation to satisfy life habits and usage modes of modern people. That is, the sustainable utilization formed by application of Sahap-won design elements, changes of layout and addition of modern facilities is of great realistic significance for expansion and regeneration of the space of cultural and economic values."

Because of market globalization and the advancement of e-commerce the importance of supply chain network is increasing. A supply chain can produce products for multiple markets. Also, an individual company is likely to have only limited visibility of the supply chain structure, which makes it difficult to make future demand estimations, because the pattern of demand propagation through the supply chain depends on the capabilities and strategies of companies along the path from the markets to the company. There will be the conflict among the pursuit of the profit of all members of the SCM. In order to maximize the total profit of the SCM, negotiation among all members is necessary. In this research, we consider only purchasing agent and supplier agent. We consider multi-agent based automated negotiation system to find the best negotiation strategy that makes all members of the SCM satisfied in a simple SCM. And we propose the trade-off algorithm to provide the total maximum profits and the minimum difference in profits of both attendances in negotiations. Multi-agent based automated negotiation system could be transformed into linear programming with negotiation information. The ideas behind the suggested model are trade-off algorithm with an agent and we consider multiple factors that are color, price, mileage, and delivery date. We``ve compared multi-agent based automated negotiation system with negotiation system with trade-off mechanism. We have used utility function as a performance measure in order to compare offer set that purchasing agent receipted."

Since all educational activities are a process of means of which the attainment of various specific aims are sought, educational teleologism has always been a subject of utmost interest in education. In fact, lots of educators are content with the short-term goals of conducting daily classes without making overall study of long-term educational goals. Such attitudes of educators remind us of a wind-blown skiff at sea without destination or compass. Three categories of educational teleologisms are logically inferred from the emphasis points between process and result of education, and manipulatively defined as 1) intrinsic teleologism of education, 2) instrumental teleologism of education, and 3) integrated teleologism of education. The success-oriented teleoligism of education is called as the model of instrumented teleologism of education. During the past seventy years in Korea, the success-oriented teleologism of education has managed our education overwhelmingly. Therefore, its dysfunctions have been accumulated and have caused various destructive and fatal infections in Korean education. In conclusion, I suggest as follows: First of all, we should drastically transform the success-oriented teleologism of education into the happiness-oriented teleologism of education. Secondly, we should incessantly do our best efforts to remodel our educational environment in which all educators and students can always be happy. After all, it is hoped that this study will be contributed as a stepping stone of some help to those educators and students in Korea who are interested in ‘happiness and happiness-education.’"

First of all, after the overview of the current society in the light of the insecurity thesis in which a trivial conflict can be transformed into a more serious conflict, we proposed a theoretical framework and practical plans in the review of the characteristics, causes, and the process of the class conflict. Based on data from 1,200 adults aged 19 years and over, this study empirically analyzed major propositions that were derived from the theoretical discussion and examined the implications. Today’s Korea society that can be characterized as a tense standoff among segregated classes needs an explanation of expansion that exceeds beyond the current theories of explanations, based on the recognition and distribution. Therefore, we framed a new social integration model focusing on a legalistic approach based on retributive justice, a welfare approach based on distributive justice, and a reconciliatory approach based on restorative justice. Study findings indicated the desire for a welfare approach was divided into two other approaches. And, the results of this study confirm that a liability approach which is based on the logic of legal or supra-legal and a reconciliatory approach which is based on the emotional sympathy are the powerful alternatives that can resolve the rising conflicts in the state of high insecurity."

The public sphere as a theoretical framework played an important role here. The public sphere and the public service broadcasting have shown a relationship of coevolution in theory and practice respectively. The aim of this paper is to review the past coevolutionary process between the public sphere and the public service broadcasting on the one hand and to sketch a future model of the public service broadcasting on the other. Since the publication of the English translation of Habermas’s “The structural transformation of the public sphere” in 1989, we have worked through adaptations and modifications in his theory of the public sphere in response to criticisms and counter-criticisms to his original ideas. As a metaphor of the critical importance of communication in contemporary societies, the con-cept of the public sphere became a guiding principle in the field of the public service broadcasting. It is well reflected in the effort of radical impartiality to incorporate diverse values as a way to overcome seesaw-like opposition, the financial basis of license fee to maintain the frame of accountability, and the active utilization of popular entertainment programs to help individuals find affective, peripheral identities. The commons can be the final goal of the public service broadcasting in today’s digitally networked communication."
the distances to open clusters from main-sequence fitting. v. extension of color calibration and test using cool and metal-rich stars in ngc 6791,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>We extend our effort to calibrate stellar isochrones in the Johnson-Cousins (BVIC) and the 2MASS (JHK(s)) filter systems based on observations of well-studied open clusters. Using cool main-sequence (MS) stars in Praesepe, we define empirical corrections to the Lejeune et al. color-effective temperature (T-eff) relations down to T-eff similar to 3600 K, complementing our previous work based on the Hyades and the Pleiades. We apply empirically corrected isochrones to existing optical and near-infrared photometry of cool (T-eff less than or similar to 5500 K) and metal-rich ([Fe/H] = +0.37) MS stars in NGC 6791. The current methodology relies on an assumption that color-T-eff corrections are independent of metallicity, but we find that estimates of color excess and distance from color-magnitude diagrams with different color indices converge on each other at the precisely known metallicity of the cluster. Along with a satisfactory agreement with eclipsing binary data in the cluster, we view the improved internal consistency as a validation of our calibrated isochrones at super-solar metallicities. For very cool stars (T-eff less than or similar to 4800 K), however, we find that B - V colors of our models are systematically redder than the cluster photometry by similar to 0.02 mag. We use color-T-eff transformations from the infrared flux method and alternative photometry to examine a potential color-scale error in the input cluster photometry. After excluding B - V photometry of these cool MS stars, we derive E(B - V) = 0.105 +/- 0.014, [M/H] = +0.42 +/- 0.07, (m - M)(0) = 13.04 +/- 0.08, and the age of 9.5 +/- 0.3 Gyr for NGC 6791.</P>"
1637년 椵島전투를 둘러싼 기억의 전승에 관한 연구,2015,[],"본 연구는 1637년 조․청 연합군이 수행한 椵島전투을 둘러싼 기억이 후대에 어떻게 전승되었는지를 추적한 결과물이다. 이를 통해 사실과는 다르게 전승되었던 가도전투 기억이 어떠한 계기로 변조되었는지, 또 그것은 어떠한 역사적 의미를 지니는지를 朝鮮中華主義라는 이념적 틀을 통해 규명해 보았다.1637년 2월 조선을 굴복시킨 淸은 여세를 몰아 明의 군사기지가 자리하던 가도를 공략했다. 물론 조선에게도 싸움에 동참할 것을 요구했으며 항복 직후의 조선은 이 같은 요구를 거부할 여력이 없었다. 결국 조선은 5,000여명의 병력을 파견했고, 문제적 사건 ‘가도전투’는 이렇게 시작되었다. 잘 알려진 것처럼 이 무렵 조선의 지배엘리트인 지식인들은 명을 上國이자 君父의 나라로 여기고 있었다. 때문에 이 공격을 망극하며 의리상 차마 할 수 없는 행동으로 생각하는 한편 내심 공격이 실패로 돌아갈 것을 바라고 있었다.문제는 조선군이 이러한 바람을 저버리고 전투에서 큰 공을 세웠다는 데서 시작되었다. 전투 참여 자체를 부끄럽게 여겼던 지식인들에게 조선군의 활약은 도무지 믿고 싶지도 기억하고 싶지도 않은 일이었다. 가도전투는 丁丑下城과 함께 호란의 패배로 조선인들이 감내해야 했던 정신적 상처 가운데 하나였던 셈이다. 그런데 시간이 흐름에 따라 지식인들은 부끄러운 기억을 과감하게 변조하려 시도했다. 그리고 그것은 대명의리론이 고양되고 조선중화주의가 성립하는 시대적 흐름과 밀접한 관련을 맺고 있었다.조선중화주의의 이데올로그이자 임경업을 대명의리의 화신으로 추켜세웠던 宋時烈은 가도전투 기억 변조의 시작점에 서서 크나큰 영향력을 행사했던 인물 가운데 하나였다. 실제로 그의 학문적․정치적 위상을 고려할 때, 17세기 말에 지어진 『林將軍慶業傳』은 기억 변조의 가이드라인을 제시한 텍스트와도 같았다. 이렇게 변조가 시작된 가도전투 기억은 다른 지식인들의 기록물에 수록되며 창의적인 확대 재생산의 길을 걸었다. 비틀린 기억 속에는 조선군의 활약이 삭제되었고 조선군이 명군을 피신시키거나 청군을 공격했다는 만들어진 일화가 삽입되었다. 그리고 이 같은 작업은 18세기까지 꾸준히 지속되었다.오랜 기간 변조된 기억은 이제 국왕의 어록이나 국가 기록물에 반영되기에 이르렀다. 자연스럽게 전투에 참가한 인물들은 추숭되었으며, 사건은 명을 향한 충정이 드러난 자랑스러운 일로 기억되었다. 변조된 가도전투 기억이 마침내 국가적으로 인정받았던 셈이다. 더 이상 가도전투는 부끄럽거나 참담한 기억이 아니었다. 대명의리를 지켰던 자랑스러운 기억이었다.이렇게 기억이 변조됐다는 사실은 자신들이 추구하는 이념적 지향에 걸맞은 사례와, 본받을 만한 롤 모델을 조선 지식인들이 훌륭하게 만들어냈다는 것을 의미하기도 했다. 그들은 이러한 작업을 통해 문명국 조선의 자존심을 세우는 동시에, 주체적 문화강국으로서 국가발전을 이룩할 수도 있었지만, 한편으로 피지배계급인 민에게 충절을 지킨 표상을 제시하여─충절의 대상인─체제에 순응하라는 묵시적인 동의도 함께 얻어낼 수 있었다. 가도전투를 둘러싼 기억의 변조는 당대 지식인들의 치열한 고민이 담긴 17∼18세기적 처방이었던 것이다.요컨대 1637년 가도전투를 둘러싼 기억은 17∼18세기 조선 지식인들의 이념적 지향에 걸맞게 변조되어 전승되었다고 할 수 있  ...","This study is a result of tracking the transmission process of related memory over the battle of Ga(椵)-island in 1637.In 1637, Choson surrendered to Qing as a result of the invasion of Manchu(丙子胡亂, in 1636～1637). Qing also called for the surrender of the Choson government, and planned to invade Ga-island, which served as a strategic base for Ming. Surrounded by Qing, Choson reluctantly decided to send the troops over. Surprisingly, the Choson army made a glorious success of the battle.At that time, the intellectuals of Choson internalized the Neo-Confucianism(性理學). And as a result, Choson had an obligation to remain loyal to Ming as it was the country of their fathers and was a suzerain state. Such idea created the notion that Choson had inherited Sino-centrism(中華), “Sino-centrismlate Choson (朝鮮中華主義, Choson-Junghwa Ideology)”.The battle of Ga-island by Choson was viewed as shameful in late Choson Sino-centrism perspective. Historically, the shameful memory had been often falsified(變造). The memories of the battle of Ga(椵)-island was not an exception. The ruling elite of Choson later falsified the historical accounts of the battle during the 17th and 18th centuries by claiming that Choson was loyal to Ming. In doing so, these falsified accounts transformed the history into a proud memory. Gradually these falsified accounts were eventually recognized as official by king’s words and national archives.As a result, the people involved with the battle were also re-evaluated. Im Gyeong- eop(林慶業) and the general Riw-rim(柳琳) of Choson army, became role models by staying loyal to Ming and as a result of the inaccuracies this particular history turned out to be positive for Choson.Falsification of these historical accounts eventually served as an example of the ideology and the role model in which the intellectuals pursued for. The intellectuals were able to use the falsification of the historical accounts to increase the self-esteem of Choson and restore the social order. The falsification of Ga-island battle memory was a prescription which was filled with agonies of the intellectuals during the 17th and 18th centuries.In short, the memories of the Ga(椵)-island battle was handed down all the while being falsified in accordance with the perspectives of the Choson intellectuals."

Althusser’s definition of art was to look, perceive and feel the ideology of the real world, and in these four essays this idea was extended into his method of research, which was to visualize the matter of ideology. Althusser criticized the political ideology of actual society, which was the subject of these artists’ works, and read these artists’ original style of expression as a criticism of the ideological attribute of artistic movements. Althusser pointed out that when the art movement surrealism is transformed into a new style in a different time and space, it becomes specialized in relation to the ideology of that time and space. Althusser opposed the perspectives, which view the human as the unified and independent subject, as well as the subject of history. This argument of his was led to the study of pictorial expression of Cremonini, who tried to overthrow the humanistic attitude, which was natural in traditional way of thinking of understanding art. In his interpretation, the ability of art to visualize ideology is embodied in Fanti’s artwork, and it reveals the ideological character of conventional expression in visual images, as well as a method of visualizing the naked ideology of the actual society, which stereotypical images try to hide, only to expose. This analysis is an effective theoretical model for discussing the process of producing and accepting images as part of ideology’s visual mechanisms."

The romance has a paradigm that the knight rides out to seek anadventure. Northrop Frye says that romance has superior characters and anarchetype that support the contemporary social structure. Often, romanceprovides its reader or audience with the nostalgia for the past to provoke ameaningful challenge to the present. Frederic Jameson has an interest on whatfor Frye is a deformation or deviation from the archetype of romance. He thinksthat romance has a historical and ideological context, and reflects a particularideological context. Geraldine Heng recognizes romance as “the name ofdesiring narrational modality that coalesces from the extant cultural matrix.”She stresses on an expansive meaning of romance as “the material concretionof the collective will of cultural agents and forces.”From these perspectives, I try to focus on Knight Tale and examine thepolitical context of Geoffrey Chaucer, the author of the Tale. He was a son ofrich merchant and served as an bureaucrat, courtier and diplomat. He wentthrough a period of turbulence in England in 14th century. Treacherousbehavior was punished severly. Writing and even talking against the royalfamily were punished. In this context, Chaucer was very cautious to reveal hisown political message. Therefore, to lessen the burden and avoid a politicalcontroversy, he appropriated and transformed the convention of romance.The adventure that romance knight seeks to carry out and achieveself-examination is not given to Palamon and Arcite. The idealized love ofromance between knight and his lady has no interactive relationship. Instead,Theseus, who reminds Edward Ⅲ according to Derek Brewer, is represented asmerciful and powerful king. He shows mercy to begging ladies and defeats OldCreon. However, he imprison Palamon and Arcite, and never intends to setthem free. After Palamon and Arcite come out of prison and fight in the forest,he makes a suggestion of tournament for winner to get Emilye, but hissuggestion causes a great misfortune, Arcite’s death. Theseus turns the criticismtoward the Providence of God and arranges the marriage between Palamon andEmilye. He first considers the allegiance with other countries and security of hiskingdom, and orders them to marry. Regardless of their intentions, Palamonand Emilye get married. The narrator says that they lived in bliss, in richnessand in health. However, this happy ending is an only conventional romanceending. By using and transforming convention of the mode, Chaucer makesPalamon, Arcite, and Emilye victims of romance. Rather, he stresses on Theseusand provides a model of king. Chaucer confidential sends his political messagethat king should use his political ability to tide over a difficult situation andvalue the opinion of Parliament."

This paper attempts to fill this void by providing a comparative case study of the BSS in four Korean cities. It finds that mayoral willingness and commitment to the promotion of a BSS as an environmental policy and the number of their consecutive terms in office explain the variation among them in terms of the stability and effectiveness of BSS in Korea. For the further development of BSS, strengthening civil society and the role of the city council is necessary to transform the current top-down governance structure of BSS into a more bottom-up style of governance."

Grieving over such problems, this paper tries to clarify the methodological essence of action research and to examine its relevant research techniques from a critical perspective. The result is reported along with seven items including the diagnosis of ‘state of the art,’ the analysis of problems, and suggestions for further studies. First, we easily find papers in which action research is either confused with field research or regarded as a branch of field research. Second, action research should be distinguished from field research for its methodological specialties even though the two shares some of the same problems and orientations. Third, the methodological specialties include: ① research on the practical site ② the actual betterment of the life world ③ the formation of subjectivity and transformation of research participants ④ production of grounded theories, among others. Fourth, especially in qualitative action research, we should attend to: ① keep the emancipatory paradigm ② value the wisdom of uncertainty ③ promote the evolution of collaboration. Fifth, we are asked to take note of new-brand action researches including: ① collaborative action research ② practitioner action research ③ critical action research. Sixth, we need to develop the connotation and denotation of action research along with various ‘action theories.’ Seventh, we offer suggestions for further studies such as: ① getting out of the old ‘before-after’ effect verification research models ② performing integrative and cross-modal research practices on three ‘Es’ (Experiencing, Enquiring, and Examining) ③ developing diverse analytic tools and creative interpretation frames ④ nourishing descriptive researches based on understanding rather than explanation ⑤ furthering ontological ‘moonzilbinbin (文質彬彬)’ approaches."
감사리스크 완화를 위한 정책 및 사업의 감사방법에 관한 연구,2015,"['Audit Methodology', 'Audit Risk', 'Policy and Program Audit', 'Risk Management', '감사방법론', '정책 및 사업감사', '감사위험', '리스크관리']",감사방법론 측면에서 최근 변화는 입증적 접근방법으로부터 위험기반 접근방법으로의 전이로 요약될 수 있다. 그러나 선진국을 비롯해 우리나라에서는 아직 정책 및 사업의 감사와 관련된 감사위험을 다루는 방법론이 감사실무에 활용할 수 있을 만큼 개발되지는 못하고 있는 실정이다.본 연구는 감사원 출신의 우수 감사인들을 대상으로 한 행동사건면접을 통해 정책 및 사업감사의 리스크와 이를 관리할 수 있는 감사방법을 확인하였다. 정책 및 사업감사의 감사리스크모형은 해당 정책 및 사업의 내재적 위험과 감사기구의 감사관리위험의 교호작용으로 표현할 수 있다. 입증감사인 재무감사와 달리 감사기구가 직접 자료를 수집하여 객관적인 의견을 제시해야 하는 정책 및 사업감사에서는 재무감사에서 크게 다루지 않고 있는 감사관리위험(또는 감사업무위험)이 감사목적의 달성을 저해하는 중요한 장애요인으로 고려되어야 한다.감사원이 공공감사의 가치를 제고하기 위해 종래의 적발식 감사에서 위험기반 감사나 심층평가적 접근을 시도하고 있지만 감사사항의 잘못된 선정이나 감사결과의 실행가능성 저하는 성과감사의 발전을 저해할 수 있다. 따라서 감사기구의 최고관리자들은 정책 및 사업감사의 리스크를 효율적으로 다룰 수 있도록 감사인의 역량을 제고할 수 있는 전략적 방안을 강구하여야 할 것이다.,"In developed countries, recent developments in the audit methodology shows the transition from the substantive methodology to risk-based methodology. But audit methodology dealing with audit risks involved with policy and program audit has not been developed to the extent of practical use of audit institutions.This study intended to identify audit risks of policy & program audit, and audit methods to mange the risks, through the behavioral event interview of excellent auditors from BAI(The Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea). Based on the interview findings, public auditors are facing with various audit risk factors in the audit process dealing with major policies and programs, which receive national attention.Audit risk model of policy & program audit can be simply expressed as follows: AR(Audit Risk) = PR(Policy & Program Risk) × MR(Management Risk of Audit Team). While gathering and analysing the interview information, it was found that policy & program audit could be vulnerable to the general risk factors in relation to the subject and the object of the audit, as much as the management risk factors of audit practice.Even though BAI should transform audit approach from substantive approach to risk-based and in-depth evaluation in order to raise the value of public auditing, the mistaken selection of audit matters and feasibility problem of audit findings can hinder the progress to performance audit. Above all thing, top management should establish the strategy for enhancing the competencies of auditors to manage efficiently audit risks of policy & program audit."

First of all, we should note that abstract painting in its nascent stage made the transition from the figurative reproduction of visual reality to the abstraction of its fundamental mode of existence. In this respect Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944), Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) and Kazimir Malevich (1879-1935) did not break, at least not entirely, with the practice of ""imitative representation"" (mimesis in ancient Greek). They sought to transcend immediate exteriority and to transpose, on the level of pictorial realization, the deployment itself of the visible. An alternative, if not complementary, conception of the abstractive process currently underpins the approaches to painting of Peter Halley (born 1953) and Ross Bleckner (born 1949). These approaches stand out through their use of abstract geometric patterns in representational terms. This characteristic makes them comparable to the practice of ""cultural imitation"" (mimesis in ancient Greek). Nevertheless, it has to be enphasized that all those variants of geometric abstraction are related, in a way that is specific to each of them, with mimesis as imitative representation as well as cultural imitation. The painting practices discussed here raise the question of the relationship of geometric abstraction to current conditions and modes of existence. This invites to consider the antinomy, outlined by the underlying theories, between the utopia of a concrete modification of space and behavior, and the dystopia of a dominant cultural ideology infiltrating aesthetics. As regards early geometric abstraction, the notion of utopia has been adapted to a process generated by meta-mimesis, that is, by the mimesis of the auto-poiesis (from autos, ""oneself"", and poiesis, ""production"", in ancient Greek) of inner and outer reality. Here, the prefix ""meta"" means that which exceeds and encompasses the mimetic means as well as mimesis itself. In another vein, it shows a shift from the mimesis of reality as an empirically determinable object to the mimesis of reality as a transcendent mode of self-production. Such a position is somewhat reversed by neo-geometric abstraction, which on the contrary has a dystopian character. Neo-geometric abstraction can also be considered as a meta-mimesis, but in its case the auto-poietic process functioning as a model is that of the dominant spatial organization and culture in the West. These details make it possible to recognize within abstract art practicesa significant shift in the interpretation of the geometric sign understood in a double sense, as a plastic medium and as a means for transforming existence. Thus, the issue of the autonomy or heteronomy of the abstract geometric form proves to be a pseudo-issue. In  fact, according to the situation, the meta-mimetic approach emerges asan integral part of the utopian or dystopian conception of the abstactive process. Therein lies the interest of exploring the aesthetic and theoretical implications of the transition from the early geometric abstraction to the neo-geometric abstraction."
a matrix of the functions and organizations that ensure continued healthcare services in a disaster,2015,"['Disaster medicine', 'Resilience', 'Area Disaster Resilience Management System for Healthcare', 'ADRMS-H', 'Coordination', 'Area']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose Japan is one of the most natural disaster-prone countries in the world. In the case of a natural disaster or mass casualty incident, a large number of injured people are likely to go to hospitals, which need to provide more services at such times. Thus, it is necessary for various bodies - such as hospitals, municipalities, medical associations, pharmaceutical associations, and trade associations - to collaborate. For example, coordination among multiple hospitals is important when transporting patients to another hospital if they cannot be examined at the first one. There is a pressing need to establish an Area Disaster Resilience Management System for Healthcare (ADRMS-H) to increase medical resilience. In order to develop an ADRMS-H and ensure that continuous healthcare is provided during calamities, it is necessary to clarify the functions (which we have already explained) and coordination that organizations must perform. Since medical care needs change by the hour during disasters, so do the functions that guarantee ongoing healthcare. This study aims to create a matrix of functions ensuring continued healthcare services in a disaster and relevant organizations to understand each one``s role and how they relate to each other. Methodology/Approach We used the case of Kawaguchi city in Saitama Prefecture, Japan as an example to illustrate related organizations needed to fulfill the functions for ensuring continued healthcare services. Next, we created a matrix of the functions and organizations. Findings This study identified related organizations such as municipalities, hospitals, medical associations, and trade associations in Kawaguchi city. Since functions for ensuring ongoing health care change by the hour, so do the organizations, whose transformations we analyzed by the hour. Value The results of this paper can help people understand how related organizations work together during disasters; in light of this, it will be possible to develop a model for an ADRMS-H in terms of coordination among organizations."
14세기 전반기 프랑스 왕권의 종교 텍스트 번역 - 필리프 6세 시기를 중심으로 -,2015,"['필리프 6세', '번역', '성서', '종교 텍스트', '문화자본', '정치적 의사소통', 'Philip VI of Valois', 'Translation', 'Religious Text', 'Bible', 'Cultural Capital', 'Political Communication']","14세기 전반기 프랑스 필리프 6세(Philippe VI, 1328-1350) 정부의 종교 텍스트 번역사업은 14세기를 전후로 이루어진 세속어 문자문화 및 문해력의 확산과 세속대중들 사이에서의 신앙심 심화와 저변확대라는 종교-문화적 현상의 큰 흐름과 그 궤를 같이 한다. 하지만 필리프 6세의 번역사업은 이러한 흐름을 단순히 뒤쫓아 가는 것이 아니라 막대한 재정을 바탕으로 이러한 흐름에 선도적인 역할을 하려는 왕권의 전략을 드러낸다. 장 드 비녜나 피에르 드 앙제스트에 의해 이루어진 5편의 종교텍스트 번역들은 한편으로는 독서문화와 신앙심의 확산이라는 당대 현상의 반영이면서 동시에 이러한 현상에 대한 왕권의 대응전략이기도 했다. 특히 후자의 차원에서 그것은 라틴어라는 권위의 언어를 잠시 뒤로 밀어두고 취약한 왕권에 정치사회 구성원들의 관심을 끌어 모으고 가장 기독교적인 왕으로서의 정당성을 확보하기 위한 정치문화적 전략의 의미를 지닌다. 또 거꾸로 왕권이 번역한 텍스트들은 프랑스왕권이라는 상징성 덕택에 다른 어떤 번역들보다도 대중적으로 성공할 수 있는 이점들을 부여받게 된다. 또한 필리프 6세의 번역사업은 14-15세기에 내내 이루어질 프랑스 왕권의 프랑스어 번역사업 후원운동의 시작을 알리는 본격적인 신호탄이라는 의미를 지닌다.이러한 번역사업의 일반적인 특성과 더불어 종교 텍스트들에 대한 번역작업은 다른 종류의 텍스트들에 대한 번역작업들과는 다른 내용상의 변형을 수반하게 된다. 즉 교회의 언어인 라틴어에서 세속인들의 언어이자 이제 막 적극적으로 왕권에 의해 사용되는 프랑스어로 언어매체가 변형되는 과정은 텍스트의 내용을 훼손하거나 직접 변형시키지는 않지만 텍스트 외적인 차원에서의 의미작용을 정치적인 방향으로 이끌어 나간다. 이러한 차원에서 왕권의 준종교적인 사명감은 국가체제가 등장하기 시작한 14세기 초에 왕국 전체에 대한 ‘통치’의 문제를 제기한다. 그것은 루이 9세에게서 보이는 바와 같은 성 프란체스코라는 종교적·상징적 모범을 만드는 것에 그치는 것이 아니라 세속적인 차원에서의 실질적인 국정운영과 인민들을 향한 배려에 대한 관심을 도출한다.물론 필리프 6세의 번역사업은 양적인 측면에서 그리 대중적인 성공을 거뒀다고 볼 수는 없을 것이다. 그러나 번역 텍스트들의 종류를 다각화시키고 있다는 점에서 중요한 시사점을 주고 있다. 종교 텍스트 번역에 대한 관심이 가장 일반적이었던 『성서』에만 국한되지 않고 성자전과 전례집, 복음서 강론집, 신비주의적 명상론에 까지 이르고 있다는 점은 왕권이 교회를 중심으로 이루어져 오던 다양한 종교적 활동들을 전유하여 자신의 다양한 상징자본을 확보하려는 시도로 해석될 수 있다. 그것은 종교장(champ religieux)에서 정치장(champ politique)이 분할되어 나오면서도 정치적인 것(le politique)이 종교에 의존할 수밖에 없는 중세 말 상황의 복잡다단한 일면을 보여준다.","The translation of religious texts executed by the government of Philippe VI(1328-1350) in the First half of 14th Century France corresponds with proliferation of vernacular literacy around the 14th Century France and with religious and cultural phenomena as intensification and expansion of private devotion. But the translation of Philip VI wasn't a simple following this trend but an expression of royal strategy for it's pioneer. The five texts translated by Jean de Vigny and Pierre de Hangest, quasi-official royal translators, was not only a reflection of contemporary lecture culture and diffusion of devotion, but also a royal reaction on these socio-cultural phenomena. Especially it also means politico cultural strategy in order to legitimate the Valois kingship as 'rex christianissimus' and to appeal to various members of political society in renouncing the Latin, authoritative language. In the other way, the translation of French kingship merit more popular success than any other texts due to the French royal symbolism. And the translation of Philip VI means the starting point for the translation patronization in the 14th and 15th Centuries.The vernacular translation of religious texts invovles a mutation of content, different with the translation of other kinds of texts. A language transformation from the Latin, ecclesiastical language, to the French, vernacular language and actively used by Valois kingship doesn't modify the contents, but it emanates  various political effects. In this point, the royal sense of religious duty propose the problem of 'governmentality' in the early 14th Century around the birth of State system. It isn't only making religious and symbolic model as saint Louis IX, but relates with state administration and consideration on people of the whole kingdom in the level of secular political community.Of course, the translation of Philip VI was not so successful in popular proliferation in the quantitative perspective. However, it suggests important meaning on the diversification of kinds of translation texts. That his translation embraces the Bible as well as Hagiography, Homely and Meditation Books presents the royal intention to ensure his divers symbolic cultures appropriating ecclesiastical activities of the Church. It show a complex scene of late Middle Ages characterized by ramification of the political field from the religious field and by dependance of le politique on the religion."

entrepreneurial discovery process and the development of the wine industry in greece: understanding industry needs towards the jrc’s innovative approach,2015,"['wine industry', 'Greek wine', 'foreign market', 'small size firm', 'EDP']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Greece wine production has shown swinging trends: in 2013 it grew by 17,9% reaching 3.7 Million Hectoliters (USDA), but it 2014 it decreased by 15% (Greek Wine Federation), whilst grape prices went up. Greece has a huge potential, but it is still a small producer in Europe.The Greek wine industry got through several phases: before the 80s the product was quite “poor”, but with the entrance in the market of some educated winemakers who have introduced a new business philosophy and approach to wine, production has changed (GaiaWines.gr). The population of firms consist of a few larger producers, and most of the companies are relatively small. Although the quality has been improved, most of the production is addressed to the domestic market, since only few producers have established export networks (Vlachvei et al., 2012).Thus, the economic crisis that affected Greece has created difficulties also for domestic sales. Background research has outlines some of the limits of the Greek wine industry: according to Vlachvei et al. (2012),the new competitive challenges require owner and managers to achieve a better understanding of operational and marketing process that can contribute to the development of their brand in order to develop an integrated marketing communication approach.The Greek wine sector is extremely fragmented with a high predominance of small size firms; as size increases, the degree of professional organization grows, as well as the relative presence of foreign markets (Papalexiou, 2009). Thus, it has been recognized that Greek wine export is disorganized (Baiocchi, 2011; Papalexiou, 2009). The limits imposed by UE to plantings have affected Greece growth strategy: Greece is still a small producer and although it shows similarities with the south of Italy, it is impossible to think to follow the “Italian Style” (Baiocchi, 2011). Thus the urgency of undertaking a propter model for the development of the industry is seen as a priority for the Greek wine system.Wineries have seen in related businesses an effective tool for improving the competitiveness of the wine industry (Papalexiou, 2009); a lot has been done for achieving an integration between wine tourism and the wine business. Background research describes the experiments undertaken around wine routes, conceived as a useful tool for improving the wine sector (Hall & Mitchell, 2000) and for the development of rural areas (Karafolas, 2007).In 2014 the Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission has undertaken a Smart Specialization pilot project that involves rural areas in Northern Greece, in order to foster local economic development by adopting an entrepreneurial discovery approach (EDP). JRC can be considered as a source of technology generation and a service that provides expert advice to the institutions of the European Union and more specifically to the European Commission and the European Parliament (Moncada-Paterno`-Castello, 2003). It can be guessed how JRC outcomes could impact citizens’ lives.From September 2014 for 15 months JRC has been involved in the European Parliament Preparatory Action; the aims of this project are: to facilitate the refinement and implementation of the RIS3 strategy in a region heavily hit by the crisis; and to serve as a model for other convergence regions in Greece and Europe (from JRC website). The project has seen the collaboration of JRC – IPTS (Institute for Prospective Technological Studies) with DG Regio and the Managing Authority of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. The wine sector has been selected, together with few others for the preparatory action. The approach that has been adopted was the Entrepreneurial Discovery Process (EDP), in order to allocate resources under the guide of entrepreneurial actors, from the public and private sector.EDP is “a process in which the entrepreneurial actors are discovering and producing information about new business and innovation activities and the government is collecting, assessing and transforming this knowledge into policy action” (http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/s3-governance).EDP plays a leading role in the Smart Specialization Strategy (S3): EDP suggests that the allocation of resources is the result of a process undertaken by entrepreneurial actors. It emerges how innovative this process is, if compared to past industrial policies. EDP contributed to minimise failures of market innovation. The Smart Specialisation perspective let entrepreneurs discovering the right domains of future specializations (Foray, 2012). A newer approach to regional competitiveness (Ketels, 2013) has been followed by European Commission, that, in order to promote an efficient and effective public funding policy in regional economic development (Mempel-Śnieżyk, 2013), has actively supported Smart Specialisation Initiatives. On the other side, S3 has a prior role in the EU Regional and Cohesion Policy 2014-2020 (Martínez-López & Palazuelos-Martínez, 2014).This paper examines the role that EDP and S3 have had in the definition of a strategy for the development of the local wine industry. The paper aims to answering to the following research questions: What are the elements seen as priorities from entrepreneurs for developing the local wine industry in Greece? Is there an overlapping between the findings emerging from JRC workshops and those that have been pointed out by relevant opinion makers and experts in the Greek wine industry? What about the effectiveness of EDP in wine?The paper is structured as follows: In the first part a description of the Greek wine industry will be carried out; in a second section authors will point out JRC’s EDP approach; thirdly an analysis of data collected from JRC sessions and from interviews with international experts in Greece will be performed.9 experts that took part to the workshop will be interviewed. Data will be collected through telephone interviews and web based survey; once collected data will be analyzed through a text analysis.A literature review on EDP and theoretical issues that have inspired the organization of JRC sessions will be presented in order to support Research Questions. The papers ends up with a discussion and conclusions in order to provide inputs for professionals, and policy makers."
교육에서 복잡성 이론의 함의,2015,"['Complexity theory', 'Complex systems', 'Complexity thinking', 'self-organisation', 'Determinism', 'Reducationsm']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The purpose of this paper explores the complexity theory as a philosophy of education is to look at the possibility of applying sought. In this paper I show how complexity theory has challenged the idea of representation and we explore possibilities for an alternative understanding of knowledge in its relationship to reality. The start of modern science in Europe, has been developed on the basis of mechanistic thinking. According to the Descartes, the operation of bodies, ranging from the grass that grows all the phenomena of the Universe can be expressed in exact formulas, and mathematics to indicate that a given phenomenon to check the analytical methodology is needed. The knowledge gained from the mechanistic view of the world predictions were possible for the unknown. Its core is determinism and reductionism. What is determinism, all that happens in the world can be changed from the beginning so determined and selected according to the laws of dynamics, so undoubtedly goes inevitably evolves. I considers questions of continuity and change in education from the perspective of complexity theory, introducing the field to educationists who might not be familiar with it. Given a significant degree of complexity in a particular environment (or dynamical system````), new properties and behaviours, which are not necessarily contained in the essence of the constituent elements or able to be predicted from a knowledge of initial conditions, will emerge. This turn derives from developments over the past two decades or so within physics, biology, mathematics, ecology, chemistry and economics, from the revival of neo-vitalism in social thought et a1.and from the emergence of a more general ````complex structure of feeling that challenges some everyday notions of social order. Within these scientific disciplines, an array of transformations took place, loosely known as chaos, complexity, non-linearity and dynamical systems analysis. There is a shift from reductionist analyses to those that involve the study of complex adaptive matter that shows ordering but which remains on the edge of chaos. Developed principally in the fields of physics, biology, chemistry and economics, complexity theory arises in some senses out of chaos theory, and before that, catastrophe theory, in that it shares chaos theory`s focus on the sensitivity of phenomena to initial conditions that may result in unexpected and apparently random subsequent properties and behaviours. Jones points out that the term <``complexity is frequently used in a manner which suggests that it is a unified concept, which may contribute to a neglect of tl1e range of different theories that deal with the implications of complexity. The concepts of complex systems include multi-scale hierarchical organisation, emergent patterning, agent-based modelling, dynamical tractors and repellors, information flows and constraints, system-environment interaction, developmental trajectories, selectional ratchets, fitness landscapes, interaction across timescales, and varieties of self-organisation. I suggests that the language, concepts and principles of complexity are central to the development of a new science of qualities to complement the science of quantities that has shaped our understanding of the physical and social worlds. Complexity offers a theoretical framework for acknowledging and helping to sustain the self-organising capacity of fully embodied systems that are realised through the intra- and inter-actions of agents within the boundary that those activities help to generate and sustain. For educators, complexity thinking points to structural conditions that one can implement to help students become aware of how self-consciousness does not precede or follow pedagogical encounters."

John P. Dimoia’s book is particularly welcome given the scarcity of scholarly work on the topic, even within the Korean academic community. The book covers the period from the United States Army Military Government in Ko-rea (USAMGIK, 1945-1948) to the emergence of plastic surgery in contemporary Korea. At first sight, the breadth of topics covered in the book was a source of con-cern. However, the author cleverly weaves the diverse subjects along the axes of the transfer of biomedical technology, nation-building, and reconstruction of the body. Furthermore, these subjects are presented against the backdrop of the emer-gence of “invasive” technologies in South Korea.  A scholar with a traditional perspective on the history of medicine would not be able to comprehend how the subjects covered in the book, from anti-parasite cam-paign to plastic surgery, could result in a coherent narrative. From the traditional, or big history, approach, these subjects have distinct characteristics: anti-parasite campaign appears to be an old nostalgic memory of the nation’s development; in contrast, plastic surgery is a social illness created by contemporary medicine. However, the author manages to link these subjects through an active acceptance of hybrid technology along with the desire for development and renovation, rather than focusing on their apparent differences.  In Reconstructing Bodies, the author selects six sites to make his argument. The first site is the “fragmented” character of the Korean medical community after World War II, which included both biomedical and traditional practices. Second, he focuses on the disease prevention activities of the USAMGIK, including mass inoculation and DDT spraying, in response to the devastated circumstances per-ceived by the military authorities. Third is the Minnesota Project (1954-1962), an emergent model for modernizing local hospitals through American and internation-al aid, which led to the making of the Korean body as an object of biomedical re-search. Fourth is family planning, which mobilized the state with new and aggres- sive technologies, such as birth control devices, and promoted a revised conception of the family and reproductive behaviors under the Park Chung Hee regime. Fifth is the national anti-parasite campaign that enforced thousands of children in the public school system to submit their stool samples for scientific examination. The sixth and final site is the aesthetic and plastic surgery in contemporary Korea, which shows the recent transformation of biomedical practice within the broader historical context.  The strength of the book lies in its unique perspective, which allows the con-struction of a consistent narrative of the broad field of Korean medicine after 1945. In this research field, the conventional approach was to focus on the remarkable development and expansion of medicine, highlighting the roles of key Korean medical scholars who served as founding fathers. The myth that Korean medicine developed rapidly from the disastrous condition after the war is at the core of the historiography of modern medicine in Korea. Any attempt to counter this central myth would have led to such contradictions as “compressed growth” with the con-comitant side effects. However, Reconstructing Bodies shows that there can be an alternative to the dichotomy of development and anti-development. While this book does not deny the dramatic development of Korean medicine during the last seven decades, it also focuses on the transformative process of biomedical technol-ogy within specific socio-political conditions and the relationship between the sub-ject/bodies and the nation-building ideology. The author explores the experience of the bodies in Korea by tracing the “transfer” rather than the “development” of med-icine.  The author makes his argument based on deliberately selected materials for each site. In analyzing each site of inquiry, he chooses the items that show the compre-hensive aspects of the site and explores the case at the micro-level. For example, to describe the Minnesota Project, he closely follows Dr. Lee Young-Gyun’s activi-ties and reveals the transformation and transplantation of Western medical knowledge such as heart surgery in Korea through the lens of Dr. Lee. Each de-scription of the site begins with a brief summary and moves toward more detailed descriptions of specific items. To make this item-based approach stronger, the au-thor covers an extensive array of Korean and English sources and uses them thor-oughly. In short, the prominent advantage of the book is the meticulous arrange-ment of the sources that strengthen its item-based approach.  However, arguments on the “sites” seem to be slightly weak in contrast to the strong arguments on the “items,” which are corroborated by plentiful resources. Occasionally, the descriptions of the sites are not based on historical resources. For example, in making the argument on the material basis of the development of med-icine, the author explains that biomedical research and autopsy increased in the postwar period. However, autopsy cases in hospitals grew at a much slower rate than the general development of medicine. Moreover, the statistics on autopsy has been excluded from hospital statistics after the 1980s, during which hospitals be-came for-profit entities. Therefore, further explanation on the distortion of biomed- ical knowledge and practice within the context of commercialized medicine in Ko-rea would make a more balanced narrative with the distortion under the nation-building ideology. This would have made Chapter 6 (“Reconstructing the Face”) more convincing.  Despite some weaknesses, Reconstructing Bodies adds much to the historiog-raphy of modern medicine in Korea. Studying the history of Korean medicine be-tween 1945 and the 1960s is difficult largely due to the lack of reliable sources, a difficulty that this book also reflects. Nevertheless, the author manages to unearth an impressive array of resources on the topic. Also, the book provides a useful per-spective, other than developmentalism, to analyze the field. The author’s perspec-tive is surely not the only way to analyze the many scenes in the history of Korean medicine in the post-liberation era. However, I hope that new lines of research will emerge based on the richness and uniqueness of this book."
exploring the italian fashion blogosphere: a netnographic approach,2015,"['fashion blogs', 'fashion trends', 'personal branding', 'branding principle', 'new technologies']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Research aim and objectivesFashion blogs are personal online diaries created in order to collect and spread information about fashion trends, products and brands for a community of followers. Since their advent, fashion bloggers became key players in the field of fashion (Rocamora, 2011). Some fashion blogs achieved so much fame and notoriety to establish themselves as crucial reference points for consumers, fundamental spaces for “the production and circulation of fashion discourse” (ibidem, p.409). This exponentially growing phenomenon revolutionized the world of fashion and the concept of fashion industry itself: fashion bloggers have been included in the institutional system of fashion, beside the traditional media industry and considered together with the fashion journalism (Pedroni, 2014).The relevance of this research field is proved by the fashion bloggers’ copious and promising revenue. It is estimated that the most successful bloggers have incomes which soar into the million-dollar range annually (Blalock, 2014). According to Forbes (2015), Chiara Ferragni, the owner of ‘The Blonde Salad’ which became the Harvard’s Business School case study, is on track to take in $8 million in revenues this year. The most of the revenue comes not only from website advertisement but from celebrity appearances, partnership with luxury brands and bloggers’ handbag, shoes and clothes line collections (Keinan et al., 2015).However, despite it constitutes an extremely appealing domain for marketing studies (Kim & Jin, 2006), research on fashion blogging is still incipient (Rocamora, 2011). As the bloggers are brands themselves, the aim of this research is to deepen the fragmentary understanding of this phenomenon through the adoption of a personal brand perspective, i.e. personal branding. In order to achieve this aim, the following objectives have been set:- How do the fashion bloggers develop and turn their personal identity and value into a personal brand?- What are their communication strategy?- What are their interaction strategies?Personal Branding: an overviewThe expression “personal branding” was introduced for the first time by Tom Peters (1997) in his article emblematically entitled “The brand called you”. In his contribution, considered to be the manifesto of personal branding, Peters points out the dramatic changes that affected the labour market, suggesting that the only way for people to succeed in a highly competitive scenario is to transform themselves into Chief Executive Officers of their own company and promote themselves learning from some of the most successful brands as Nike, Coke, Pepsi (ibidem). Personal branding (also known as self-branding, cf. Kaputa, 2003) is based on the idea that it is possible to apply to people the same marketing and branding principles originally developed for products and companies (Sheperd, 2005). It can be defined as a process by which individuals recognize their strengths and uniqueness and promote themselves to a target audience. In other words, building a personal brand means to identify what makes a person unique and different from their competitors or peers, but it also refers to the ability to communicate, in an effective way, your own source of competitive advantage (Centenaro and Sorchiotti, 2013; Kaputa, 2012; Labrecque, Markos & Milne, 2011; Shepherd, 2005). Although Peter’s (1997) original idea of personal branding was more generally based on individuals facing the “off-line” labour market, this approach can be used also to explain some “on-line” phenomenon. New technologies, in fact, created computer mediated environments, resulting in virtual spaces where people can present and express themselves using digital traces (Schau and Gilly, 2003).Research MethodologyUsing in-depth interviews and netnography, this work examines how a group of popular Italian fashion bloggers managed to build their personal brands and grow their value. A multi-methods research based on the combination of no-structured interviews (conducted both face-to-face and through Instant Messaging channels) and a netnographic approach1 was used to analyze the fashion blogging phenomenon. The in-depth interviews involved four Italian fashion bloggers selected with a snowball sampling. These interviews, performed in the explorative phase of the research, in addition to provide a preliminary exploration of the fashion blogging scenario and first empirical evidence, favoured the development of categories of analysis that have been successively deepened through the netnographic approach. The netnographic analysis, started in April and still in progress, has been applied to fifteen Italian fashion blogs, selected among the 100 most followed blogs indicated by Les Cahiers Fashion Marketing, an online fashion marketing magazine. Among them, the blogs selection was performed following the criteria suggested by the literature about netnography (Kozinets, 2010): the presence of relevant information related to the research focus and questions; the presence of recent and regular communication and a large interactivity between the blogger and other participants2; the occurrence of detailed and descriptively rich data. Drawing lessons from the literature (ibidem)3, data collection was performed trough a non-participant observation approach, that has allowed researchers to collect data in a completely unobtrusive manner and work on naturally occurring texts, not distorted in any way by the analyst’s presence. The collected data included both bloggers’ posts and audience’s comments. Moreover, in addition to textual material, visual and audiovisual data have been collected and analyzed. During the analysis, two different processes of netnographic analysis, analytical coding and hermeneutic interpretation, have been usefully combined and performed. In the following paragraph, the first results obtained, until now, through a combined analysis of excerpts of interviews and netnography will be shown.ResultsPreliminary research evidence shows that the success of a fashion blogger depends mainly on: • A clear definition and development of a personal identity;• The effort to coherently convey the personal identity through an effective management of different communication and interaction tools;• The development of a network that can maximize blogger’s visibility and notoriety.Identity and value dimension: self-presentation strategiesBlogs are usually presented as spaces in which an authentic personal style can be expressed. Analyzing the bloggers’ entries, it is possible to recognize how the concept of personal style plays a fundamental role, representing the main element on which the blogger’s identity is based (Kulmala, Mesiranta and Tuominen, 2013). The most important tool for the expression of the blogger’s personal style is posting the outfit of the day: i.e. an outfit worn on a particular day or during a particular event or occasion, based on the combination of different brands and products. As bloggers and readers’ attention is not focused on specific products and brands, but, rather, on how single pieces of clothing are assembled and combined together, every daily outfit works as a style statement expressing and reinforcing the blogger’s personal identity and, at the same time, provides inspiration and identification by his followers (Pihl, 2014).Communication strategy: style and toolsThe netnographic analysis shows how the starting level of the published contents is very amateur, where the bloggers usually lack a well-defined communication strategy. However, observing the sampled blogs through a diachronic netnographic approach, it is possible to recognize a gradual change involving both the writing style and the visual elements. Texts became better-finished, effective, studied in detail, with continuous intertextual references to older posts about similar or related topics. The products or brands presentation and description are never de- contextualized, but always inserted within a narrative structure. In other words, fashion bloggers make use of the potentials offered by visual storytelling, presenting products as a part of bloggers’ daily life, always intertwined with bloggers’ autobiographical information (Rocamora, 2011). Simple and interesting personal stories are displayed in order to allow readers to identify themselves with the blogger and his core values. Moreover, pictures are taken in a very professional way, paying close attention to every element as light, colours, and locations.In addition to the daily update of the blog, bloggers’ communication strategy embraces the logics of a pervasive personal branding by managing different platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Instagram in order to build a strong and coherent diffused identity on the net.Interaction strategies: network and partnershipsThe relational dimension involves three main types of relations.First, with readers: bloggers try to ensure audience’s engagement and loyalty, encouraging readers to express their opinions about the proposed outfit; provide customised advice and suggestions; promote their active participation through contests and giveaways. On the other hand, users use comments to support the blogger’s activity, show their approval for the proposed outfits or suggest modifications and variations to the blogger’s proposal.Secondly, the relational dimension concerns the connections with other bloggers: fashion blogs define together a community of style (Pihl , 2014), a real network characterized by continual mutual references among its nodes. It is especially through the tools of comments that bloggers promote each other, posing at the bottom of the comments links to their blog and inviting other readers to visit it.Finally, the relational dimension concerns the relationships between bloggers and fashion brands. The analysis of the in-depth interviews puts in evidence that collaboration dynamics frequently established between fashion brands and bloggers can take different forms: from inviting the blogger to choose specific brand products and give them visibility through a review on the blog, to invite the blogger to take part as a guest or model in a fashion parade or new collection presentation or in a brand photo shoot. These forms of cooperation can take more structured forms and transform into more complex co- branding strategies: there many examples of bloggers that, in partnership with well- known brands, realize and launch limited or special products edition.Implications and limitationsAccording to our preliminary results, the success of a fashion blogger depends mainly on his ability to transform the blogging activity into a personal brand. In some cases, the branding process reaches its highest fulfilment when the blogger launches and promotes a personal collection resulting in an independent fashion brand. The interest in the phenomenon for marketers mainly derives from the different forms of collaboration that can be established between bloggers and fashion companies. For bloggers, those partnerships represent important occasions to enrich their portfolio and increase their reputation and credibility by the target audience. On the other hand, fashion companies can use blogs as a tool to collect decisive information about consumers (cf. Kulmala et al., 2013), exploit the visibility and reputation of fashion bloggers and benefit of an extremely powerful communication means. In fact, as bloggers use their own language, their messages are considered to be more direct, intimate and authentic by readers.As this study has an explorative nature, it is not aimed at generalizing its results, but rather at deepening the knowledge about a still underdeveloped and uncertain phenomenon, i.e. the Italian fashion blogging. However, the research has been performed following the evaluative criteria proposed by literature about netnography (Kozinets, 2010), i.e. coherence, rigour, verisimilitude and innovation."
a modern approach to al-malakah al-lisāniyyah in ibn khaldun,2015,"['Ibn Khaldūn', 'Linguistic Aptitude', 'Acquisition of Language', 'Definition of Language', 'Linguistic Habit', '이븐 칼둔', '언어적 자질', '언어습득', '언어의 정의', '언어이론', '언어습관']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"and BookⅠof his historical book 'kitāb al-ʕibar'. The Muqaddimah can be regarded as one of the most perfect historical book in the 14 century considering that it attempted to discover a pattern in the changes that occur in man's political and social organization.Especially, rational in its approach, analytical in its method, it represents an almost complete departure from traditional historiography and conventional concepts beyond the mere chronicles of historical events and the explanation of history.In explaining historical data, Ibn Khaldūn adopted a scientific method totally new to his age, and used new terminologies to drive his ideas and thinking. The Muqaddimah follows a logical arrangement. It begins with man's physical environment and its influence upon him. This is followed by an analysis of primitive social organization, the character of early leadership, and the relationship of primitive human societies with each other, as well as their relationship to the higher, urban form of society. Then government of the state, the highest form of human social organization, is discussed in general and that of the Caliphate, the special Muslim case, in particular. Ibn Khaldūn tried to explain how the higher human social organization is formed from primitive human societies. It is followed with suggesting some terminologies such as 'tamaddun' (urbanization), 'ʕumrān'(civilization), and 'ʕaṣabiyyah' (solidarity, group consciousness). In this paper, it is not needed to explain each of them, but the focus should be centered on the term 'malakah' (aptitude). Ibn Khaldūn used this term to answer to theproblem of how all higher civilization is preserved. He considered 'malakah' as a factor to make a man master a craft or a science through continuous practice, thus making it 'habit'. Since the acquisition of habits is a matter of education and training, habits can be passed on to others willing and fit to learn them.The aim of this paper is to make a modern approach to the conception of al-malakah al-lisāniyyah (the linguistic aptitude) which takes the most important position in Ibn Khaldun's study of language.In an obvious sense, it is a re-interpretation of al-malakah al-lisāniyyah from a modern linguistic point of view. This approach leads us to recognizing the continuance of the method of linguistic study by comparing between Ibn Khaldun's views of language which were totally developed to his age and some modern linguists' theories, especially generative transformational theory.In order to accomplish the aim, this paper will, in the second chapter, deal with Ibn Khaldūn's definition of language and compare it with some modern linguists’ definition. In the third chapter, the definition of al-malakah al-lisāniyyah will be made with the prescription of its conditions and preconditions. Likewise, the comparison between al-malakah al-lisāniyyah and linguistic competence by Chomsky will be made to assure the theoretical relations between them through the language acquisition. This will give us a clear answer to the question we might ask “Why compare al-malakah al-lisāniyyah with Chomsky's work rather than alternative models such as those developed by Brame, Bresnan, Gazdar and others.” In the last chapter, this paper will present the method of Ibn Khaldūn's linguistic study - the descriptive and explanatory method,stressing the necessity of recognizing that his linguistic method has been influenced by the historical method."

However, this approach has also revealed limits, such as exclusivity and obstructiveness to outsiders. Rethinking the notion of community, Jean-Luc Nancy formulated the concept of “the inoperative community” to overcome these limits and present a new principle that does not assume homogeneity or unity. The inoperative community is the community that regards just “being together” itself as the primary value, so that relationships can exist even by virtue of doing nothing; these new or newly recognized relationships can then create changes in human existence. This paper examines characteristics of the community depicted in the South Korean film Welcome to DongMakGol(Directed by Park Kwang-hyun and produced by Jang Jin·Lee Eun-ha·Ji Sang-yong, 2005) from the perspective of Nancy`s inoperative community. First, it discusses the nature of totalitarian communities and the way the inoperative community deconstructs such traditional notions of communities. Then, it analyzes the community presented in DongMakGol as an inoperative community by analyzing characters and events in the movie. DongMakGol is a place in which a variety of racial, linguistic, ideological, and national identities collide, intersect, and conflict with one another. Since the DongMakGol community does not assume the possibility of a “pure” identity, it doesn`t require people to assimilate into any homogeneous social body and instead transforms itself when newcomers arrive, fostering a “being-together” with them. In particular, the treatment of minorities and “death” in this movie makes cracks in the solidity of immanence, so that these tropes perform a huge role in formulating a “being-together” community. Even though it is unrealistic to build an inoperative community like DongMakGol in real life, it is still meaningful to consider the model of the community we should pursue that it represents."

Especially, Ilbonwanghwan-ilgi is a record of a visit to an enemy country during a war and a work recording Japan by a method that could not be seen in Sahaeng-nok in the early Joseon period. Nevertheless, its volume was rough compared to other Sahaeng-nok, and its theme was not clear, so until now, no active research has been carried out. Sahaeng-nok during the early Joseon period was recorded by the king`s order or a need of the royal court, so it mainly contained limited information about Japan or was written in a direction that a necessary fact would be added to already known information. However, Ilbonwanghwan-ilgi, apart from the method of writing previous Sahaeng-nok, was recorded experiences in Japan in the form of a journal. Hwang Shin recorded every single experience in the journal so as to perceive Japan`s situations in the present time, accurately. He, also, explored a more variety of knowledge about Japan and left it in the form of Mungyeon-nok. Though it did not have an extra title of Mungyeon-nok, when the missions as an envoy ended, Hwang Shin arranged the forms of power, institutions, customs, flora and fauna of Japan on the back page of the journal, following a regular order. This method of description became a model of late Joseon Tongsinsa`s Sahaeng-nok. In addition, he recorded Mungyeon-nok, focusing on the heterogeneities between Joseon and Japan. Unlike early Joseon Tongsinsa`s Sahaeng-nok that aimed to maintain peaceful Gyorin (neighborly relations) System, Ilbonwanghwan-ilgi revealed Joseon`s hostility to Japan as well as the strained relationship between the two countries as it was. This perception of Japan, also, connected to late Joseon Tongsinsa`s Sahaeng-nok, intactly. In this sense, Ilbonwanghwan-ilgi is a material through which we can clearly understand the relationship between Joseon and Japan at the time, which was being transformed by Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592 and a work as an example of late Joseon Tongsinsa`s Sahaeng-nok."

In this paper, I attempt to analyse unique gaze and desire of Changbi`s Minjung-oriented literary critics. Chapter II deals with the development and transformation of the term ``Minjung`` the literary as well as academic field paying attention to the writings of major critics such as Baek Nak-cheong, Yom Mu-ung, and Shin Kyung-lim. In chapter III, I discuss what motivated them to over/underrepresent Minjung``s field of lives and their bodies. They believe that they can find out the best model for sound body and spirit of Minjung in mean and shabby places in Korean society. According to them, true spirit of Minjung are present in various dialects and slangs they speak in everyday lives. Interestingly enough, their concern with physical materials including Minjung``s voice remind us of Heidegger`s metaphysical thinking of presence what Derrida tried to deconstruct in his philosophical investigations. Although there is explicit inconsistency in Changbi`s Minjung-oriented literary criticism, Changbi played a key role in building, spreading, and supporting progressive thoughts in Korean society. It is the specific circumstance where Changbi can be the manifestation of the oppressed but energetic body of Minjung that made Changbi the most influential media in Korean history."

Its research object was totally 40 persons of 20 students of the 4th to the 6th Grades from Sulsan Elementary School, Gunsan, and 20 students of the 3rd to the 6th Grades from Elementary Schools of Community Child Center around Iksan city. Its research period lasted for 4 months from September to December, 2014, and I, as the research place, used the art room at Sulsan Elementary School, and the lecture room of Hands-on Science Class, Wonkwang University, Iksan. The programs were totally 8 sessions with a unit of 1 session per 20 persons for 2 hours from 1:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon every Friday and Saturday.  I fixed four themes of this program-one plane modeling, and three solid modeling, and finished the work of storytelling during summer vacation. The plane modeling is ‘Meeting with The Shadow Monster and Goblin’, and the solid modelings are ‘Seeking for a Bluebird in My Mind’, ‘Making a Sweet Home’ and ‘A Tale of My Friend Made of Scrap Irons’.  Then I utilized exclusive techniques of art expression according to each theme, which were in sequence silk screen, Korean paper art, clay formation, and Junk art techniques. And I delivered the scientific knowledge in terms of growing or manufacturing processes of materials used in making artworks.  After being processed this program, I surveyed about the students’ ability of integrated thinking and emotional experience by the questionnaire, and took statistics with SPSS/window 12.0. And I converted the subject’s variables to a percentage, and executed the x2(chi-square) test in order to compare with the characteristic according to variable  As a result, as for the student’s ability of integrated thinking, the percentage of the students to have responded the contents of this program as ‘This program was useful, for it led me to display my creative ideas’ was 89.3, and especially that as ‘This program was very useful, for it led me to display my creative ideas’ was 41.3. And, as for the student’s emotional experience, the percentage of the students to have responded the contents of this program as ‘This program was interesting and satisfactory, for it made me enjoyable’ was 88.5, and especially that as ‘This program was very interesting and satisfactory, for it made me enjoyable’ was 55.5.  Judging from the statistic values of two fields such as the student’s ability of integrated thinking and emotional experience, I estimate that over the majority of the students showed enhancement in self-confident creative expression as well as higher interest and concern through this program.   The result that I arranged and analyzed the making process of artworks, the photos of the resultant, questionnaire, etc. as such is as follows :   Firstly, as a result that I proceeded this program as art-centered STEAM class, the student’s systematic problem-solving ability was improved in his ability of integrated thinking to transform the literary contents into artistic one.  Secondly, the student obtained the emotional experience such as interest in the class, selfconfidence, intellectual satisfaction, self-fulfillment, etc. through art-centered STEAM class using four art expression techniques.  Thirdly, the student’s mind willing to cooperate, communicate with his friends, and care for them was ripened in the process of problem-solving.   Fourth, the student’s self-confidence was further instilled when presenting famous artist and his artworks in the introduction and finale of four art expression techniques.  Likewise, the statistic values on the fields of student’s ability of integrated thinking and emotional experience illustrate that over the majority of the students showed improvement in the ability of creative expression with confidence as well as higher int"
조선후기 야담에 나타나는 노구의 특징과 의미,2015,"['Kisaeng', 'negative goddess', 'Yadam', 'Nogu', '꼭두각시', '할미', '기생', 'Halmi', 'Deviant women', 'Kkodugaksi', '요귀', '노구', '조선후기 야담', '일탈형 여성', '부정적 여신']","노구(老?)는 고대사회에서 종교의 사제, 왕의 조력자, 왕가의 연분과 관련한 일을 담당한 여성이지만 중세사회에서는 그 위상이 추락하여 양가 자제와 여염집 유부녀의 불륜을 조장하는 비속한 여성으로 나타난다. 그러나 한편으로 여신이나 월하노인의 이미지를 가진 신성한 여성으로 인식된 점을 볼 때, 성과 속의 복합적 성격을 가진 인물로 사료된다. 노구에 대한 그간의 연구는 추상적 특징을 제시하는 데 머물 뿐 구체적인 모습과 그것이 우리 문학에 어떻게 반영되는가는 충분히 살피지 못했다. 따라서 본고는 조선 후기 야담을 텍스트로 하여 노구에 대한 당대 사람들의 인식, 노구의 신분과 직업 및 활동 등을 살피고, 야담에 나타나는 이러한 특징이 조선후기 놀이문학과 이야기문학에 나타나는 일탈형 여성과 어떻게 연결될 수 있는가를 고찰하고자 한다. 야담에 나타나는 노구의 특징은 크게 세 가지로 살필 수 있다. 첫째, 경이롭고 두려운 요귀로 인간에게 해악을 끼친다. 다만 거구, 완력, 베짜기, 집을 관장하는 신격 등의 소재를 통해 일반적인 요귀가 아닌 고대의 창조 여신과 관련하여 인식되었음을 알 수 있다. 둘째, 주인공의 일을 돕는 숨은 능력자의 모습을 가지고 있다. 이때 노구는 표면적으로는 위기나 곤란에 빠진 주인공을 돕고 있지만 그것이 결국 국가나 왕에 대한 조력으로 이어지는 특징이 있다. 셋째, 기생이나 술과 관련한 미천한 일에 종사하는 늙은 여자이다. 노구의 직업은 기생어미, 사당, 주모, 약을 파는 상인, 청루의 포주 등으로 나온다. 그런데 다모나 의녀의 경우 기생을 겸한 것을 볼 때, 노구의 직업은 기생, 의녀, 다모, 사당을 중심으로 한 하나의 범주를 형성한 것으로 볼 수 있다. 야담은 여느 문헌에 비해 노구의 구체적인 모습을 잘 보여주고 있고, 이를 통해 우리는 노구가 조선후기 문학에 미친 영향을 추론할 수 있다. 먼저 놀이문학에서 노구는 가면극의 할미와 꼭두각시를 형상화하는 데에 본보기가 되었다. 그 근거로 할미의 원형이 창조의 신, 대모신의 신성한 신격이라는 점과 또 극 중 할미의 직업이 노구와 유사한 사당, 포주, 무속인인 점을 들 수 있다. 즉 신을 인격화하는 데 있어 노구는 구체적인 본보기가 되었던 것이다. 이야기문학에서는 의 뺑덕어미, 의 괴똥어미, ?꼭두각시전?의 이부인, 의 옹녀 등 유교적 규범에서 일탈한 여성을 표현하는 데 영향을 주었다. 이들 일탈형 여성들이 가진 물욕, 식욕, 색욕, 수면욕은 당시 사회에서는 부정적 으로 인식되었지만, 한편으로 체제에 구속되지 않는 인간의 본성과 원초적 카오스에 대한 향수를 일으킨다. 이처럼 인간적 본성이 집약된 여성상이 조선후기 문학 전반에 형상화된 데에는 이들과 가장 가까운 거리에 있었던 여성, 즉 노구의 모습이 영향을 주었을 것이다.","Nogu(老?, an old lady) was in charge of the love affairs related to priests, royal assistants and royal families in the ancient times, changing into a vulgar woman aggravating illicit love between sons from a good family and middle-class married women in the medieval society. She, on the other hand, was considered a sacred woman with an image of goddess or Weolhanoin(月下老人). In other words, Nogu had a combined character with the divine and the worldly. This research shows Nogu’ social status, occupations, specific activities and her significance associated with immoral women described in the entertainments and narratives based on the Yadam in the late Joseon Dynasty. Nogu is largely classified into three characters in the romantic folktales. First, she was a mysterious and dreadful ghost doing people harms. However, it is noticed that she was not a common ghost but a negatively transformed figure from the ancient creating goddess who had taken control over a giant, forcing power, a loom and housing. Secondly, she has an image of a hidden able person to help main characters. Considering this image viewed in folktales including Yeoyongsa and a celebrated doctor, Yusang, Nogu was seemingly helping main characters in danger and trouble, finally turning into a role of helping a nation or a king. Lastly, she was an old woman who engaged in humble jobs containing Kisaeng and drinks. Nogu’s jobs are referred to as Kisaeng’s mother, Sadang, a barkeeper, a vendor selling remedies, a keeper of a brothel, and so on. But, given that Damo or a doctor assistant played combined roles of Kisaeng, those jobs account for one category of putting all of Kisaeng, a doctor assistant, Damo and Sadang together. These aspects of Nogu have had great influence on a view of women in the late Joseon literature. First of all, Nogu became a role model shaping the images of Halmi and Kkokdugaksi in mask play in the entertainments. There are some grounds in that a goddess of season and Mother goddess are the prototypes of Halmi and Halmi’s jobs are similar to those of Nogu. Nogu, namely, grew a detailed model to express a divine being as a human being. Nogu has had an impact on displaying the women who would escape from Confucian tradition, such as Ppaengdeukeumi of Simcheongga, Koiddongeumi of Bokseonhwaeumga, Mrs. Lee of Kkokdugaksijeon and Ongnyeo of Byeonkangsoiga in the narratives. The desires of materials, appetite, sex and sleep which immoral women indulged in were regarded as rejected in those days, which has provoked nostalgia for unrestrained human nature and instinctive chaos. Likewise, the looks of Nogu, who had the closest relations with these women, seem to have had an effect on the image of woman with intensified human nature widely represented in the late Joseon literature."
15세기 王室發願 변상판화와 새로운 도상의 유입,2015,"['새로운 도상의 유입', 'Promoted by the Royal Family(王室發願)', 'The Woodcut Print(變相版畵)', 'the inflow of the new icons(신도상의 유입)', 'Gangyeongdogam(刊經都監)', 'Prince Hyoryeong(孝寧大君)', 'Cheonghee-wanghoo(貞熹王后)', 'Insu-daebi(仁粹大妃)', '王室發願', '變相版畵', '刊經都監', '孝寧大君', '貞熹王后', '仁粹大妃']","본 연구에서는 조선개국 이후 불사가 활발하게 이루어지는 15세기, 즉 太祖~成宗期에 왕실 에서 간행된 경전변상판화의 개판상황과 그 중 조선에서 새로운 도상이 삽입된 변상판화를 중심으로 도상의 연원과 유입배경 등을 살펴보았다. 조선 전기 왕실에 의한 불사는 주로 왕실의 妃嬪들을 통해 이루어졌음은 잘 알려져 있으나, 이 당시 佛事와 관련된 發願文과 간행경전의 刊記 등을 살펴보면 왕실의 남성들, 즉 大君이 나, 君, 또는 왕실의 宗親들도 적극적으로 불사를 후원했음을 확인할 수 있다. 그리고 이 시기 抑佛의 분위기 속에서도 이와 같은 왕실의 일원들에 의한 불사가 가능할 수 있었던 것은 佛 事의 목적이 유교적 가치관에 부합하는 王室의 安寧과 繁榮, 그리고 先亡父母에 대한 祝願 등이었다는 점과 이러한 佛事를 진행했던 이들의 사회적 지위도 佛事를 가능하게 하는 큰 힘으로 작용하였으리라 여겨진다. 현전하는 15세기 왕실발원 변상판화는 총 20점이며, 이 시기 변상이 포함된 사경이 2점 사성되어 이를 포함하면 총 22점의 변상이 현전한다. 그리고 그 중 이전까지 볼 수 없었던 새로운 도상이 등장하는 사례는 총 14건으로, 이 시기 등장하는 새로운 도상의 불교변상들은 이후 대부분 조선시대 불교변상을 대표하는 변상판화로 지속적으로 간행되거나 또는 후대에 새롭게 제작되는 변상판화들의 模本이 되었다는 점에서 조선시대 佛敎版畵史에 있어 매우 중요한 위치를 차지한다. 또한 이 시기 왕실발원 판화 중 刊記를 통해 중국의 판본을 들여와 이를 模本으로 간행하였다는 기록이 있거나, 현존하는 중국의 판본들을 통해 그 유입사실을 추측할 수 있는 판본은 총 6점으로, 이 작품들은 근거로 이와 같은 도상들의 유입경로를 추정 해 본 결과, 이 변상판화들은 당시 사회상황과 왕실발원 경전의 간행에 참여한 인물들을 매개 로 그 실마리를 찾을 수 있었다. 즉 조선은 개국 초 明의 門禁조치에도 불구하고 世宗, 世祖 와 貞熹王后, 仁粹大妃 같은 好佛主들의 적극적인 경전간행의 열기가 중국을 오가는 사신들 의 경전구입으로 이어졌던 것으로 보이며, 이와 같이 유입된 경전들이 이 시기 간행되는 경전 들의 模本이 되었던 것으로 여겨진다. 조선 전기 對明使臣들에 관한 기록이 다른 시기에 비해 절대적으로 부족하여 현재는 정확한 양상을 파악하기에 아직 부족하지만, 앞으로 이와 관련 한 중국의 기록이나 당시 사대부들의 文集 등에 대한 연구가 활발하게 이루어진다면 더 많은 자료를 얻을 수 있으리라 생각한다.","Buddhist work flourished in the 15th century Joseon, which was under the reign of King Taejo(太祖) through King Seongjong(世宗). Among the work, it is notable that new icons appear in many woodcut prints of Buddhist scriptures promoted by the royal family. This study investigates the origin of the new icons and contexts of their inflow. Specifically, this study focuses on the circumstantial background of their publication and on the woodcut prints with the new icons in that period. It is well known that the queen and the royal concubine engaged in the Buddhist work by the royal family in the early Joseon. However, postscripts in relevant written prayers and published scriptures indicate that men in the royal family such as the king, princes(i.e Prince Hyoryeong), and relatives actively supported the Buddhist work. Despite the suppression of Buddhism in this period, such Buddhist work could be done because the royal family was in charge of it and its purpose conforms with Confucian values, i.e. well-being and prosperity of the royal family and prayers for the dead parents. Twenty woodcut prints promoted by the royal family in the 15th century are handed down. Two manuscripts with transformation painting can be included, and that makes 22 transformation images in total. Among them, fourteen prints have the new icons. This new icons are noteworthy as they represent woodcut prints of Joseon and such prints continued to be produced throughout the dynasty. Moreover, they became a model of woodcut prints of the future. Six woodcut prints imply the inflow of the new icons: either by the postscripts in woodcut prints promoted by the Joseon royal family which record that the new icons are modeled after the icons in Chinese prints, or by the resemblance between the new icons in woodcut prints of Joseon and China. Based on these six prints, the channel how the icons flew in could be presumed, and WHO participated in the publication and HOW the social aspect was in that period seem to be the key. Specifically, the rulers of the early Joseon such as King Sejong and Sejo(世祖), and Queen Cheonghee-wanghoo(貞熹王后) and Insu -daebi(仁粹大妃), were favorable to Buddhism so that they were eager to issue Buddhist scriptures. This seems to have led envoys to purchase Chinese Buddhist scriptures, and those scriptures were used as the basis of Buddhist scriptures promoted by the royal family of Joseon. A clear and better understanding is limited at present, due to the fact that not sufficient record is available regarding envoys of early Joseon to Ming of China. However, further studies on relevant records of China and collected works of high officials of that period would bring more data/materials for this research."

""Dosan"" Ahn Chang Ho, along with compatriots, Rhee Syungman and Kim Goo were the most respected leaders and independence activists.Dosan was called the ""people's teacher"" or the ""people's pioneer"" as he was recognized as an educational thinker and activist; many documents and papers on Dosan give credence to this. However, when one looks at his political, diplomatic, educational and militaristic contributions to the independence movement, his nurturing of leaders was a vital element to obtaining liberation. In the end, his ultimate goal was to establish an independent nation. By examining his leadership styles, one can understand the methods and appreciate the skill sets he relied upon to obtain his ultimate goal.Dosan's struggle for liberation could be divided into two paths: active participation in the independence movement and gradual nurturing of young leaders. His unique leadership revolved around these two paths. This paper examined the leadership that manifested from these two paths.Dosan's leadership was examined using  the established ""leadership theory."" The result: the origin of Dosan's leadership, Dosan's nurturing of talent, and Dosan's anti-Japanese efforts could be divided into three groups.Firstly, the source of Dosan's leadership  is his charismatic talent. His ""authentic"" and ""servant""  leadership styles complemented his charismatic gift. This cohesion strengthened his charismatic quality. This multi-faceted charismatic leadership served as the foundation for all the independence movement activities.Secondly, the type of leadership behind Dosan's nurturing of young talent comprised of ""super leadership"" and ""self leadership"" working in unison. Dosan's expectations were that young leaders mature and partake in the independence movement as well.Thirdly, the type of leadership Dosan relied upon to combat the Japanese imperialists was a fusion of transformational and strategic leadership. More specifically, his entire participation in the independence movement revolved heavily around the fusion of his transformational and strategic leadership; however, his strategic leadership held everything in place, allowing his other styles of leadership to work in cohesion.This dissertation researched the way Dosan was able to rely on many different styles of leadership to be fusible with one another. This multi-faceted leadership comprised of his charismatic gift, authentic leadership, super leadership, transformational leadership, and strategic leadership. Out of all these, the strategic leadership model was the key element that played a vital role in his independence movement activities. I would like to call this model of multi-faceted leadership, ""Dosan's Fusible Strategic Leadership."

It was unlike the Gun/Hyeon system, in which local  prefects were dispatched from the central to other regions, as representatives of the  central government. In reality the classical enfeoffemnt system was not employed, at least to the letter, since  the days of the Ancient Han(漢) days. The idea behind the system, however, had a powerful influence upon other areas of administration as it was still being regarded as the ideal  system. The idea was composed of various elements that would keep the appeal of the  system, in the eyes of the subjects and not to mention the leaders: such as the relationship  between the Emperor and the feudal lords, universe’s(九州) 5-class(五服) Mourning Attire system(or  the 9-class Mourning Attire system[九服]), the Royal vicinity(王畿) and Outlying Safeguards(藩屛), as well as the Central(國) and the Surrounding zone(野). Examined in this  article are all these concepts, as well as the perceptions the people had back then, in order  to determine how feudal ideals were reflected in medieval capitals. This world of universal order was a world that would have many other smaller worlds inside,  all spreading outward in a concentric fashion, yet sharing the same center where the  Emperor was living. Distance from the central would dictate the level of relationship that  region enjoyed with the central, and also the central’s potential treatment of the region. Due  to such environment, since the Southern Sung era, a notion of a decentralized political  structure, composed of both the Emperor who directly ruled a relatively small center(王畿)  and feudal lords in charge of their own regions, both pursuing a peaceful civil governing,  was ideologically established. Both the Goryeo dynasty, and the Joseon dynasty in its early days, tried to establish their  own status in their realms, which represented not only discrimination (from the center) but  also autonomy (in their own realm). Even with the advent of the Mongol Yuan empire, and  its intervention in Korean affairs, the Goryeo Confucian scholars at the time intended to  describe their own status and the world as a peaceful regime and a stabilized order. Their  efforts and aspiration continued to hone with the advent of Ming. Within the purview of civil ruling, feudal lords governed their respective realms  autonomously, and the capital became the symbol and center of such governing, which would ultimately all tie into the main capital of the Emperor himself. Capital cities, the embodiment of political  power of individual states, were regional centers that characterized such senior order, and  also pillars which sustained it. Such a way was universal, and also absolute, and at the  same time ubiquitous, as the capitals could exist in multiple places. The world of the  civilized and the world of the barbarians were different, but there was always a room for the  latter to transform itself into the former. The capitals of the lords and capitals of the Emperor were virtually centric positions placed  on different levels of a hierarchic order. ‘Protocols(禮),’ or any set of conduct codes for  that matter, served as a format or method that would allow a civilization demonstrate itself.  Through the task of devising a series of dynastic ritual codes, Joseon wanted to establish a governance based upon protocols and codes of conduct. It shows that Joseon was not  interested in creating a power base that would allow itself to rule the people with force. It shows that it was really trying to create a benevolent governance based upon ideals. The  result was a governing model that even the Confucian classical texts would not dare  suggest, a model that took both reality and ideals into account, so that it would become a new  experiment in dynastic governing."

기획되었다. 특히 하천생태계를 대상으로 생태계서비스 특성에 따라 그리고 가치측정 관점에 따라 적용 가능한 다양한 방법론을 검토하고, 대표적인 측정방법인 지표와 경제적 가치추정 기법을 활용하여 사례연구를 진행하였다. 또한 의사결정지원을 위한 통합 측정체계 분석 틀을 설계하고 물리적측정(지표)-화폐화(경제적 가치추정)를 연계하는 사례연구를 제시함으로써, 개별 방법론으로부터 도출된 정보를 통합하는 접근법을 예시하였다. 본 연구는 하천 생태계서비스 분류체계 재정립을 시작으로 지표개발, 가치추정, 통합 측정체계 구축 3부문이 2년도에 걸쳐 병렬적으로 진행되었다. 국내 적용 가능한 하천 생태계서비스 분류체계는 MA(2005), TEEB(2010)에서 제시한 범용적 분류체계를 기반으로 전문가 검토를 거쳐 완성하였다. 생태계서비스의 범주, 즉 공급, 조절,지지 및 문화서비스의 기본 틀은 유지하되, 범주별 세부항목은 재구성하였다. 하천생태계의 공급서비스에는 식량, 에너지생산, 담수제공, 원료, 유전자원이, 조절서비스에는 기후조절, 수질정화, 수량조절, 재해조절이, 지지서비스에는 서식처제공, 생물종다양성이, 문화서비스에는 생태관광, 휴양/레저, 교육/과학, 경관미, 종교/문화유산이 주요 항목으로 포함된다. 하천 생태계서비스 측정 지표개발은 해외사례를 중심으로 개념적 틀, 지표유형, 지표 선정기준을 검토하고 전문가 인터뷰를 통하여 지표후보군을 구성한 후, 도출된 지표후보군을 대상으로 전문가 설문조사를 통하여 타당성을 검증하였다. 전문가 설문조사는 생태계서비스 범주(공급,조절, 지지, 문화서비스) 간의 상대적 중요도와 범주 내 세부항목 간의 상대적 중요도 평가를 위한 AHP 설문과, 범주 내 세부항목 측정지표의 대표성 평가를 위한 Delphi 설문으로 구분하여 진행하였다. 지표후보군은 다시 대표성 평가결과와 측정가능성 평가결과에 근거하여 활용지표,미래지표, 대체지표, 잠재지표 4개의 유형으로 구분하였고, 선정된 지표후보군 중 대표성이 높은 활용지표와 미래지표 중 지도화가 가능한 항목을 선별하여 전국 5대 대권역 113개 중권역으로 시범적용하였다.본 연구의 지표개발은 생태계서비스 항목별로 1∼2개의 지표를 선정하기보다는 다수의 지표를 유형분류를 거쳐 메뉴 형식으로 제시하는 접근법을 취하였다. 이는 하천 생태계서비스 지표개발이 국내에서 처음으로 시도되는 작업이라는 점을 감안하여 가능한 한 다양한 측면을 고려한 다수의 지표후보군을 제시하는 것이 향후 관련연구를 위한 기반구축 차원에서 유용하다고 판단하였기 때문이다. 그러나 동일한 서비스 항목을 다양한 관점에서 측정하고자 한 노력 때문에 지표 간의 중복성, 위계의 불일치, 인접 생태계와의 상호연관성 배제 등의 한계를 내포하고있는 것도 사실이다. 향후 분석목표에 따른 지표의 차별화(상태지표 또는 성과지표), 선정기준의 개선(대표성, 측정가능성, 정책활용성 등), 측정목표와 지표 간의 과학적 상관관계 규명을 위한 기초연구 확대, 지표유형(활용, 미래, 대체, 잠재지표)에 따른 관리방안의 차별화 등이 지속적으로 이루어져야 할 것으로 생각된다. 하천 생태계서비스 가치추정은 수요측면과 공급측면으로 구분하여 접근하였다. 먼저 수요측면의 가치추정은 직접연구 설계 시 범위설정과 관련된 이슈를 정리하는 작업을 시작으로,환경가치종합정보시스템(EVIS)으로부터 하천 생태계서비스 항목별 단위가치(원단위)를 도출하고, 도출된 단위가치를 활용하여 5대 대권역으로 가치합산(value aggregation)을 진행하였으며, 가치합산 과정 및 결과해석상의 유의점을 점검하였다. 진술선호법 지불의사액(원/월/가구,2010년 기준)에 기초한 수량조절, 수질정화, 재해방지(홍수조절)의 단위가치는 각각 4,724원,3,869원, 2,285원으로, 지불의사액(원/년/가구)에 기초한 휴양/생태관광, 서식처제공의 단위가치는 각각 11,659원, 1,224원으로 나타났다. 또한 하천생태계가 제공하는 물공급, 수질정화,재해방지의 연간 가치는(5대 대권역 합계 평균값, 2010년 기준) 각각 5,012억원, 4,104억원, 2,424억원으로 집계되었으며, 서식처제공 가치는 217억원, 휴양/생태관광의 가치는 2,067억원으로 집계되었다. 서식처제공의 경우 다른 서비스에 비해 연간 총 가치가 현저히 낮은 것을 볼 수 있는데, 이는 지지서비스에 대한 낮은 인식이 단위가치에 대한 저평가로 이어지고 다시연간 가치의 저평가로 이어지는 실증적 증거라 할 수 있다. 앞서 제시한 지불의사액(WTP)기준 가치추정이 수요자(수혜자) 측면의 가치표현이라 한다면 생태계서비스 제공을 위한 비용기준의 가치추정은 공급측면의 가치표현이라 볼 수 있다. 생태계서비스는 시장에서 거래되지 않는 공공재이며, 따라서 수혜자의 지불의사액(WTP)과는 독립적으로 공급 및 관리가 이루어진다. 본 연구는 생태하천복원사업 비용과 공공부문 투자액분석을 통하여 생태계서비스 제공을 위한 공급측면의 가치를 도출하였다. 먼저 2014년 금강유역18개 생태하천복원사업 내용 분석결과, 전체 사업비의 17.9%가 수질개선(조절서비스), 16.5%가 생물상보전 및 복원(지지서비스), 5%가 생태계체험 및 교육시설(문화서비스)에 배정된 것으로 나타났다. 2013년 세출결산 기준 정부 관련부처의 생태계서비스 예산투자는 총 8조8천억에 이르는 것으로 나타났으며, 이 중 공급서비스가 12.98%, 조절서비스가 81.33%, 지지서비스가 0.37%, 문화서비스가 5.32%를 차지하는 것으로 집계되었다. 본 연구에서 도출한 수요측면의 생태계서비스 가치와 공급측면의 비용은 전혀 다른 관점에서 측정한 결과이기 때문에 비교 가능한 수치가 아니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 편익과 비용 크기의 상대적 편차는 생태계서비스 가치를 바라보는 수요측면과 공급측면의 어긋남(mismatch)을 단적으로 보여주고 있다 할 수 있고, 따라서 정책적 시사점도 크다. 특히 생태계서비스 관련공공부문 투자의 대부분이 조절서비스에 투입되고 있으며 조절서비스 제공에 기반이 되는 지지서비스에 대한 투자는 절대적으로 부족하다는 점에 주목하고자 한다. 이는 현재 공공부문에서 생태계 자산(asset)의 보호 및 관리에 대한 투자가 매우 미흡하다는 의미이기도 하다. 지지서비스에 대한 투자를 통하여 조절서비스, 공급서비스, 문화서비스 제공을 담보할 수 있고, 생물다양성/생태계서비스의 보전 및 지속가능한 이용을 위한 효과적인 정책이행이 가능하다. 향후 관련예산 배분의 우선순위 조정이 요구되고, 서식처 보호 및 생물종다양성 유지에 대한 정책적 관심이 요구되는 이유이다. 본 연구에서 설계한 통합 측정체계의 개념적 틀은 생태계-인간후생 연계구도, 가치의 관점, 생태계기능/서비스 범주, 적용 가능한 측정방법론, 통합 접근법을 주요 구성요소로 포함하고 있다. 가치의 관점은 생물다양성/생태계서비스의 중요성 평가를 어떤 측면에서 바라보느냐에 따라 생태적 가치, 공유가치, 개인가치로 구분하였고, 방법론은 측정목표에 따라 생·물리학적방법론, 사회·문화적 방법론, 경제학적 방법론으로 구분하였다. 다음으로 가치의 관점과 적용가능한 방법론을 묶어 생태계기능/서비스 범주와 연계하였다. 즉, 생·물리학적 방법론은 생태계구조/과정-기능 간의 상호연관성 규명을 통한 지지기능 내지는 조절기능 측정에, 사회·문화적방법론은 지역공동체의 생태계/생태계서비스 의존정도 및 공유가치 측정에, 경제학적 방법론은 공급서비스와 문화서비스(생태관광)로 인한 직접적인 후생증가 또는 조절서비스로 인한 간접적인 후생증가에 따른 개인가치 측정에 대략적으로 대응한다고 볼 수 있다. 통합 접근법은 개별 방법론으로부터의 이질적 정보를 종합하는 병렬적 통합과 연결변수를 중간에 두고 방법론을 이어주는 순차적 통합으로 구분하였다. 병렬적 통합은 비교 가능하지않은 정성적/정량적 정보의 종합에, 순차적 통합은 방법론 간의 연결변수를 통해 정량적 정보를 종합하는 접근법에 해당한다. 본 연구는 순차적 통합에 중점을 두고 생태계서비스의 물리적측정(지표)-화폐화(가치추정)의 연계방안을 공급량×단위가치의 공식에 근거하여 생태계서비스범주별로 도식화하여 제시하였다. 또한 담수 이용 서비스의 가치, 하천습지의 수질정화 가치,강변저류지의 재해방지 가치를 대상으로 순차적 통합 사례연구를 진행하였다. 본 연구는 의사결정지원을 위한 생물다양성/생태계서비스의 측정범위를 어떻게 설정하여야하며 방법론적으로 어떻게 접근해야 하는가 하는 문제의식으로부터 출발하였으며, 제시한 통합측정체계의 개념적 틀은 이러한 고민들을 담고자 하였다. 향후 연구차원에서는 개별 방법론/통합 접근법의 개선과 사례연구를 지속적으로 진행하고 연구결과를 축적하여 ‘과학적 사실에 근거한 의사결정’의 기반을 구축하여야 할 것이다. 더불어 의사결정자 및 관련 정부부처는 경제적 효과성/효율성 우선 기준으로부터 벗어나 다양한 가치의 관점을 수용할 수 있어야 하며, 이를 현실화할 수 있는 새로운 의사결정 패러다임 구축에 노력하여야 할 것이다.","This two-year project (2015~2016) develops a classification of ecosystem services for freshwater ecosystem in Korea, proposes a set of indicators to measure the supply of ecosystem services, and examines the unit-values of ecosystem services based on the Environmental Valuation Information System (EVIS), which is an on-line database of the valuation studies conducted in Korea. The ultimate purpose of the study is to design an integrated framework linking indicators and economic valuations to provide comprehensive information to decision-makers by combining physical and monetary information for the freshwater ecosystem services. Drawn from the classification of ecosystem services by MA (2005) and TEEB (2010), a classification of ecosystem services for freshwater is proposed including the provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services with sub-items for each category. Food, freshwater use, renewable energy, raw materials and genetic resources are the sub-items of provisioning services. Sub-items of regulating services include climate regulation, maintaining water quantity, water purification, natural disaster control, and biological regulation. Biodiversity and habitat provision comprise supporting services. Cultural services include eco-tourism, recreation, education, and religious/cultural heritage. Multiple indicator candidates for each sub-item of a service category were selected, reviewed, and modified through literature surveys and expert consultations in the first year (2015). The AHP survey was conducted in the second year (2016) to evaluate the relative importance between the service categories and among sub-items within each category. The Delphi survey is designed to examine the representativeness of indicator candidates selected for each sub-item of a particular service category. In addition, we investigate the measurability of each indicator depending on the degree of data availability. Using representativeness and measurability as the criteria, indicator-candidates are grouped into 4 types, which are readily-usable, future-use, proxy, and potential indicators. Readily-usable indicators are the ones ranked ‘high’ in both criteria, suggesting that the indicators in this type ensure representativeness and measurability for the corresponding sub-item of ecosystem service. Future-use indicators score ‘high’ in terms of representativeness and are ‘low’ in measurability, implying that the indicators in this type can be utilized in the near future once their measurability is improved. In contrast, proxy indicators can be categorized as having ‘low’ representativeness and ‘high’ measurability. Note that proxy indicators are literally ‘proxy’ implying that they need to be replaced with ones that are both representative and measurable. One of the research areas which should be pursued afterwards is to find ways to improve the measurability of future-use indicators, transform them into readily-usable indicators and replace proxy indicators. Finally, this study proposes one to three indicator candidates for each sub-item of ecosystem service categories. Economic valuation of ecosystem services takes approaches from two different perspectives . demand and supply sides. The demand-side analysis begins with discussing the linkages between classification of ecosystem services, total economic value (TEV) and relevant economic valuation methods. The unit-values of freshwater ecosystem services are derived from on-line database of valuation studies, EVIS. In order to extract the proper sets of willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates for comparison, we confine our analysis to the estimates where the same valuation method and the same measurement unit are used. A total of 74 estimates are derived which use the stated preference methods with measurement unit of won/month/household. Among these estimates, water quantity supply, water purification, and natural disaster control of regulating services comprise 10, 34, 8 estimates, respectively, and the corresponding average unit-values are 4,724won, 3,869won, and 2,285won(2010=100), respectively. Using these unit-values and the number of households reported from the 2010 Population and Housing Census, the total values for each ecosystem service category are computed in 5 main watersheds of Korea . Han, Nakdong, Geum, Seomjin, and Yeongsan River watersheds . in Korea. The nation-wide total values, in terms of averages, of water quantity supply, water purification, and natural disaster control of regulating services are estimated as 501.2, 410.4, and 242.4 billion won/year, respectively. The supply-side analysis examines the costs associated with the provision of freshwater ecosystem services. Most ecosystem services share the characteristics of public goods and are not traded in the market and, therefore, the management and supply of ecosystem service are governed by the public sector. First, this study reviews the budget allocations of 18 eco-river restoration projects by the Ministry of Environment in the Geum River watershed in 2014. The analysis reveals that 17.9, 16.5, 5.0% of total budget are allocated to water quality improvement, conservation and restoration of biodiversity and construction of education facilities, respectively, implying that the focus of the eco-river projects is to enhance the regulating and supporting services. Second, we examine the expenditures (or investment) executed in 2013 to improve freshwater ecosystem services by the government including the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and the National Emergency Management Agency. The total sum of government expenditures corresponds to 8,882 billion won in 2013, where 12.9, 81.3, 0.3 and 5.3% were spent to improve provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services, respectively, indicating that most efforts were concentrated in enhancing regulating services. The conceptual framework of integrated measurement system to assess ecosystem services is described in the Figure 1. The framework is composed of 5 elements . stated in the far left panel of Figure 1 . including ecosystem-human wellbeing pathways, value perspectives, ecosystem function/services, applicable methods and integration approaches. Perspectives of value is classified as ecological, shared and individual values, and applicable methods are grouped into bio·physical, socio-cultural and economic methodology. Once the perspectives of value, applicable methods and ecosystem function/services are combined, their link among them becomes clearer. The bio·physical modeling is relatively more suitable for quantifying the regulating functions, rather than the services, and the results are more likely to be ecological flow/asset/insurance values in physical terms. The socio-cultural methods such as stakeholder interview and group preference analysis are useful to examine the dependence of community on ecosystem services, which can be translated into shared values. Economic methods are relatively more appropriate for measuring the individual values associated with direct and indirect consumptions of ecosystem services such as food, eco-tourism and water quality regulation. This study defines ‘integration’ as a way of combining and synthesizing the information collected from individual methods. In this context, we classify the integration approach into parallel integration and integration in sequence (or impact pathway analysis). The former refers to the approach of synthesizing heterogeneous or immensurable information gathered from individual methods in descriptive or narrative fashion. The latter approaches are based on the link where actual variables or information are received/given between methods . similar with the procedures of impact pathway analysis . to combine the information. This study concentrates on the latter approach and proposes the ways of linking physical and monetary information by ecosystem service categories. In principle, the formula for combining of information is to multiply the quantity-supplied by the corresponding unit-value. We provide 3 case studies linking indicators and economic valuations . the value of freshwater use, the values of water purification function from riverside-wetland and the values of flood control from riverside buffer zone . to illustrate the integration procedures."

Although the papacy already lost his authority after ‘Outrage of Anagni’ in 1303 and his settlement at Avignon, a series of political crises of French kingdom begun in 1315 permitted John XXII, pope of Avignon to restore the papacy in conformity with the pastoral idea. He could establish an elaborate administration and finance system on this basis. Meanwhile, at the time of oubreak of the Hundred Years’ War, the pope lost definitely the status as universal and spiritual leader of Western Europe. In this context, it is necessary to focus on the Conference of Vincennes in 1333 as a definite moment for loss of papacy in Western Europe.Philip VI of Valois, who have ascended to the throne as a collateral line of Capetian dynasty, prepared extensively the crusade expedition as a way of legitimation of his kingship. And John XXII assisted him both materially and morally as spiritual leader on the level of dispensation. On the other hand, John XXII proposed his own specific theory on the Beatific Vision and Philip VI organized a conference in order to investigate this theme with various theologians of University of Paris at his manor of Vincennes in 1333. Of course, this conference was profoundly theological, but it involved also a declaration of independence of French kingship from the papacy. Finally, the thesis of pope John XXII was judged heretic and John XXII died of shock soon.After the conference, three phenomena appeared: 1) formation of Thomist doctrin around the University of Paris; 2) establishment between the French kingship and the university of Paris; 3) unexpected outbreak of the Hundred Years’ War after failure of crusade project with the death of John XXII and the accession of Benedict XII. The conference at Vincennes cannot be an immediate cause of these three phenomena, but a turning point marking a decline of Papal universalism and its replacement for new orders in various areas."
quantization of emergent gravity,2015,"['Models of quantum gravity', 'gauge-gravity correspondence', 'noncommutative geometry']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Emergent gravity is based on a novel form of the equivalence principle known as the Darboux theorem or the Moser lemma in symplectic geometry stating that the electromagnetic force can always be eliminated by a local coordinate transformation as far as space-time admits a symplectic structure, in other words, a microscopic space-time becomes noncommutative (NC). If gravity emerges from U(1) gauge theory on NC space-time, this picture of emergent gravity suggests a completely new quantization scheme where quantum gravity is defined by quantizing space-time itself, leading to a dynamical NC space-time. Therefore the quantization of emergent gravity is radically different from the conventional approach trying to quantize a phase space of metric fields. This approach for quantum gravity allows a background-independent formulation where space-time and matter fields are equally emergent from a universal vacuum of quantum gravity.</P>"
estimation of side lobes in ultrasound imaging systems,2015,"['Discrete Fourier transform', 'Side lobe estimation', 'Spatial frequency', 'Suppression', 'Ultrasound imaging']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose We propose a new method of estimating the sidelobe levels from received ultrasound channel data.Methods Ultrasound signals impinging on an array transducermanifest themselves as sinusoids whose spatial frequencyvaries as a function of the incident angle. The receivedchannel data from the main lobe direction have a spatialfrequency of zero when considered across all the channelsbecause individual channel data have the same phase in thetemporal domain, while those from the side lobe directionshave a spatial frequency that is not zero and varies with theultrasound beam incident direction. Thus, the receivedchannel data can be modeled as a sinusoidal waveform thathas a specific frequency depending on the incident angle.The side lobe components are modeled as a sum ofsinusoidal waves that have a frequency equal to an integerplus a half. We estimated the side lobe waveform that has aninteger-plus-a-half frequency by adaptively varying thewindow length in the spectrum estimation. The effect of sidelobes on ultrasound image can be reduced by subtracting theestimated side lobe waveform in receive focusing.Results To confirm the efficacy of the proposed method,ultrasound field simulations and experiments were carriedout. We observed that the 1st to 5th spatial frequency sidelobes estimated using the proposed method were present atthe same positions as the side lobes in the field response. Bysubtracting the waveforms of the 1st to 20th spatialfrequency side lobes, we reduced the side lobe levels by upto 14 dB. Experiments on wire phantoms in a water tank alsoconfirmed that the proposed method can estimate and reducethe side lobe levels.Conclusions We have proposed a new method of estimatingand canceling side lobes that is validated through bothsimulation and experiment."

control of compliant legged quadruped robots in the workspace,2015,"['Quadruped robot', 'Jacobian', 'bond graph modeling']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Locomotion control of a quadruped robot requires a well-defined gait pattern (i.e., a coordinated actuation of its four legs in some particular fashion with respect to time). It is of practical importance to move the leg tips in a desired trajectory in order to achieve specific objectives such as to avoid obstacles, minimize energy consumption and locomotion time. Along with body displacement, body orientation is an equally important limit parameter during each leg step of the gait pattern. There are several possible gait patterns that maintain stable and aesthetically pleasing locomotion, and most of these are biologically inspired. This article presents quadruped locomotion control in the workspace through a novel control scheme in which the leg forward motion is controlled in the workspace while the body forward motion is controlled by providing the required effort directly to the joint actuators. In this control approach, the leg tip trajectory error drives a proportional-integral controller that is then transformed through the Jacobian to generate the corrective joint torques. For the body forward motion, leg motion is arrested and the joints are provided with opposite motion, which are controlled by a proportional-integral-derivative controller. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement in the workspace. The performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated through simulations and animations.</P>"

Sportswear is not in fashion just temporarily but comes in various forms along with sociocultural phenomenon that put emphasis on well-being and leisure. Thus, the need for studying sportism at various levels observed in modern fashion is raised. Therefore, this study explores the history and concept of sportism that has an influence in modern fashion and analyses design characteristics of sportism. Furthermore, it aims to analyse the formative elements of sportism fashion including items, silhouettes, textures, colors, and design characteristics that were seen in the world’s four major S/S and F/W collections in Paris, Milan, New York, and London between 2012 and 2014, during which recent sportism gained attention again. For analysis of types and formative elements of sportism fashion, visual data was collected from www.style.com based on the formative elements used in former studies. the selection of visual data was conducted focusing on the major four collections of the last three years from S/S selection in 2012 to F/W selection in 2014, and of a collection of the 17,448 photos, 265 photos of sportism design were selected at the end through a Focus Group Interview (FGI) of five fashion majors with Master’s degree in fashion for the objectivity of visual data. Based on the 265 photos, design characteristics were analysed according to design formative elements which are items, silhouettes, textures, colors, and details. The study results are as follows. Fashion reflecting sportism has many straight silhouettes, using lively and casual items such as pants, skirts, and dresses. Regardless of seasons, many items are composed of comfortably and lively soft items, and gray colors take up the most part in general. Details that reflect sportism such as hoods, pockets, and zippers were seen in Paris collection in a variety of ways, particularly regarding functionality. Characteristics in sportism can be categorized into the six parts of functionality, simplicity, sexuality, movability, and future-orientedness, and constructivity. First, when it comes to functionality, straight silhouettes, bulky items, gray colors, Velcros, drawstrings were added to sports items like an anorak or a windbreaker. It can be said that functionality was focused on to increase the warmth of clothing in order to protect the body. Second, simplicity was expressed with straight silhouettes using items such as jackets, pants, skirts, etc. by using stiff texture and minimizing details. Third, sexuality was expressed with bodyconscious silhouettes using items such as body suites, miniskirts, and shorts by using elastic or see-through textures to highlight the female body. Primary colors were used most, and details such as piping, binding, buckles were used. Fourth, movability was expressed with straight or bulk silhouettes using items such as miniskirts, Blouson jackets, wind breakers. Furthermore, soft and crisp textures and various primary colors were shown, and various details were presented with pockets, drawstrings, Velcro, zippers, snaps, buckles, etc. Fifth, future-orientedness was characteristic of metallic texture, and was expressed with motorcycle jackets and anoraks having straight or bulk silhouette. Their details include buckles and metallic zipper, binding, or piping. Last, constructivity was presented with jackets and dresses using bulky, crisp, stiff textures, which was represented as bulk silhouette and hour-glass silhouette. In addition, gray or neutral color was used with details such as zippers and drawstrings. It can be said that sportism design seen in modern fashion is attempted at various levels by satisfying desires for beauty presented with fashion as well as for functionality allowing for sports activities. Furthermore, sportism becomes a fashion code of sorts, playing a major rol"

He insists that a work should be able to serve as text for performance and at the same time to gain the sympathy of contemporaries. For this aim, Lee Yun Taek uses such techniques as disorganization and reorganization. Disorganization and reorganization do not conflict with each other but are complementary concepts which separate and reorganize the elements of a play to make a new work having new significance.  Lee Yun Taek borrowed the format of the ""play in a play"" in his work『Faust in Blue Jean』in a try to secure Korean contemporaneity by citing the contents of the original in a reduced form. He transformed the spatial and timely background of the original to the Korean version in the 90s, placing focus on critical events of the then times.  The writer even ventured to reconstruct the figures of the original for the purpose of intensifying the dramatic meaning and fun. He didn""t change the names of the figures in the original to Korean ones to heighten the effect of strangeness or ""Verfremdungseffekt"". Usage of the names that are not well-matched with locality was designed to keep a certain distance from criticism concerning behaviors or awareness of the characters in the play. By typifying the plots of figures and characters of the play, the reality and sociality of the play could be amplified and their action became more predictable.  『Faust in Blue Jean』is an example of Lee Yun Taek""s playwriting technique <Now-Here-We> showing his efforts to detail in the drama the structures of Korean timely situation as well as political and social life by paraphrasing the original『Faust』. The writer pursued significance and fun simultaneously in his recreation of Western classical dramas.

The paper specifically studies the usefulness of vague set theory for the exploration of hesitation information and vague association rules. The hesitation information of an item plays a vital role in making selling strategies for the exhilaration of business. For this purpose, the vague set concept can be used as an important tool which can assist in the identification of hesitated item. The vague set theory with its two membership function provides more intuitive way to interact with the vague situation that causes the hesitation for any item.

When the22 wt% of non-micellizable polymeric impurities in the AR Pluronic F108 is taken into account, however, a universalconcentration dependence of the BCC lattice spacing is observed, unifying results from both AR and Pure F108solutions. When the PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer concentration from the HPLC analysis is employed as aneffective polymer concentration parameter, the universal relationship is observed to provide strong evidence that thepolymeric impurities in AR F108 locate themselves in the less dense parts of the interstitial regions on the BCClattice points, where were occupied by the triblock copolymer micelles. Although the polymeric impurities in ARF108 do not affect the actual triblock concentration dependence of the lattice spacing, they do shift the onsetconcentration of BCC micellar ordering. In the Pure F108, the onset of BCC packing occurs at the point where thenearest-neighbor radius (Rnn) in the BCC lattice is approximately equal to the hydrodynamic radius (Rh), indicatingthat lattice formation begins upon “hydrodynamic contact” between micelles. In the AR F108, the onset of packing occurswhen Rnn/Rh is approximately 0.9, indicating that, in the presence of the polymeric impurities, micelles must be forcedtogether beyond the point of hydrodynamic contact for the BCC packing."

On the other hand, the design of these devices with uncoordinated Power System Stabilizer (PSS) may degrade the performance of the power system. In addition, the power systems are vast, complex and nonlinear. Linear control strategies do not have a satisfactory performance for these systems, especially when some disturbances occur. In this study a nonlinear control strategy based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is designed to control PSS and ASMES for a standard power system. The results demonstrate that the proposed coordinated control strategy based on RNN lead to improvement in stability of frequency and terminal voltage responses of the generator."
a hybrid under-sampling approach for better bankruptcy prediction,2015,"['Bankruptcy Prediction', 'Under-sampling', 'k-Reverse Nearest Neighbor', 'One-class Support Vector Machine', 'Classification', '부도예측', '언더샘플링', 'k-Reverse Nearest Neighbor', 'One-class Support Vector Machine', '분류']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The purpose of this study is to improve bankruptcy prediction models by using a novel hybrid under-sampling approach. Most prior studies have tried to enhance the accuracy of bankruptcy prediction models by improving the classification methods involved. In contrast, we focus on appropriate data preprocessing as a means of enhancing accuracy. In particular, we aim to develop an effective sampling approach for bankruptcy prediction, since most prediction models suffer from class imbalance problems. The approach proposed in this study is a hybrid under-sampling method that combines the k-Reverse Nearest Neighbor (k-RNN) and one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) approaches. k-RNN can effectively eliminate outliers, while OCSVM contributes to the selection of informative training samples from majority class data. To validate our proposed approach, we have applied it to data from H Bank’s non-external auditing companies in Korea, and compared the performances of the classifiers with the proposed under-sampling and random sampling data. The empirical results show that the proposed under-sampling approach generally improves the accuracy of classifiers, such as logistic regression, discriminant analysis, decision tree, and support vector machines. They also show that the proposed under-sampling approach reduces the risk of false negative errors, which lead to higher misclassification costs."
analyzing the consistency of business process based on behavioral petri net,2015,"['Behavioral Petri net', 'Behavioral distance vector', 'Interactive process model', 'Behavior compatibility']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Analyzing the consistency is the important part of business process management (BPM). Existing researches only consider the structural consistency of process model, or analyzing the single data. However, sometimes, the model is consistency without considering data in real life, while it is inconsistency after analyzing control and data. In this paper, based on the labeled behavioral Petri net, considering the change of data, the control flow and data flow of business process model is established from the perspective of partner process, and then obtains the interactive process model by interacting them. In the end, according behavior profile and behavior mapping, the behavior vector of the mapping transitions is given to calculate the behavioral distance vector and gets the behavior compatibility between the corresponding process models. If all behavior compatibilities can close to 1, BPM is consistency, and vice versa. In addition, it is proven that the method is valid by analyzing the theory and example."

The value portfolio includes firms whose EBIT/EV, B/EV are among the highest 25 percent for U.S. stocks. The growth portfolio includes firms in the bottom 25 percent.we used all stocks in Portfolio123 which are supplied by Compustat, Standard & Poors, CapitalQ, and Reuters for the period of January 2, 1999 to December 31, 2014. We classified firms that have high ratios of EBIT/EV, B/EV as value stocks. Firms that have low ratios of EBIT/EV and B/EV are defined as growth stocks. The overall results show that the value stocks outperform the growth stocks. These results are not changed with different holding periods. The requirement of ROE (above 5%) has the impact on the performance of growth stocks. The growth portfolios based on EBIT/EV registered higher returns than the value portfolios. However, when we narrowed the sample to the large firms, the value stocks tend to outperform the growth stocks. The implications of the study are: (a) high EBIT/EV and B/EV ratios may be a good indicator of the underpriced security. EBIT/EV and B/EV ratios are a more discerning method, compared to earnings to price (E/P) or book-to-market equity (B/M) ratios. By using EBIT/EV and B/EV, we can utilize other fundamental data about the firm's debt position, tax and enterprise value ; (b) return on equity(ROE) is useful in finding good stocks relative to firm's future earnings streams. As a firm's earning is expected to grow, the performance of the growth stocks also improves. You don't need to avoid such a stock of the firm with high return of equity."

For the first part of the study, it examines the current state and history of capital gains tax of real estate for Korea, Japan and U.S. The capital gains are legitimately included in the comprehensive income base since they represent additions to net worth. However, their measurement is not without problems. For one thing, individuals may not realize their capital gains in the same period in which they accrue. The capital gains accrue as the value of asset rises but these gains are only realized when the assets are converted into money through selling them. For many types of asset such as real estate, including accrued capital gains in the income base would involve valuing each individual’s holdings of asset periodically since market value may not be established. Capital gains are normally included as income only when realized. This causes many problems for long-term gains for more than a year: the bunching of long-term gains, the opportunities for timing the realization of gains and losses, and the lock-in effect of the tax on capital gains. Each country has treated these problems differently. This study suggests that capital gains should be included in the taxable income as the ordinary income(i. e., labor income, business income and investment income) in Korea. While capital gains on short-term assets shall be taxed at regular income tax rates, capital gains on long-term assets shall be taxed at the rates lower than regular income tax rates. In addition, this study provides suggestion that home sellers can claim exclusion of capital gains tax only if home meets the condition of owner-occupied housing irrespective of the numbers of owning houses. For the second part of the study, it examines the current state and history of tax on holding of real estate taxes for Korea, Japan and U.S. The property tax of real estate has been used mainly by local government because the local governments are better able to coordinate taxpayer with the benefits of public service financed by the tax in U.S. In mid-20th century, Japan and Korea introduced U.S. type local property tax of real property on benefit principle. However, in addition to local property tax, Japan and Korea adopted national property tax(Land Price Tax in Japan, Comprehensive Real Property Tax in Korea) to overcome the problem of sharp price rises of real estate. This study suggests that discrimination against the multi-home owner should be eliminated to determine the eligibility of Comprehensive Real Property Tax in Korea. Also, this study suggests that Korea should adopt a circuit breaker of property tax and special assessment used in U.S."

Prior research has presented the phenomenon of heaping for analyst forecasts of annual earnings per share(EPS). And Herrmann and Thomas(2005) provide evidence that rounded forecasts are less accurate than other forecasts. In this paper we adopt a different and extended approach to Herrmann and Thomas(2005). Specifically, we have to take into account that Korean stock market can sometimes differ from U.S. stock market. And then we expand the prior research to analyst forecasts of operating income, net income, and sales. This study used 269,510 analyst forecasts collected from KOSPI over 2001 - 2012 period and empirically tested the relationship between heaping and forecast accuracy. The samples used in this study are retrieved from KIS-VALUE database and the forecast data are retrieved from Fn-DataGuidePro database. We observed the phenomenon of heaping for analyst forecasts of operating income, net income, and sales. And then we investigated the relationship between heaping and forecast accuracy. To examine the relationship, we used multiple regression method using the forecast accuracy as a dependent variable and rounding as a research variable . In addition, we include various control variables identified in prior studies. The selected control variables are characteristics of analysts and firms. The analysts characteristics are the previous absolute forecast error of analyst, the previous forecast error of analyst, the number of analysts employed by the broker employing analyst, the number of firm forecasts made by analyst, the number of years of firm-specific experience for analyst, the number of calendar days from the forecast date to the earnings announcement date, the number of firms followed by analyst, and the number of industries followed by analyst. And the firms characteristics are the market value of firm, debt ratio, return on assets, ratio of market value to book value of equity of firm, ratio of the largest shareholder, covariance of 1 year daily stock return, and standard deviation of 1 year daily stock return of firm. Also, Herrman and Thomas(2005) examines the correlation of stock returns with earnings forecast error to determine which forecasts have a stronger association with market expectations. We adopt this methodology to determine whether Korean capital market expectations better reflect a consensus including rounders or one excluding rounders. The results are consistent with our expectations. The main findings of the study are as follows. First, we find that EPS forecasts do not have heaping but analyst forecasts of operating income, net income, and sales occur in 10 intervals at a much greater frequency than actual operating income, net income, and sales. Second, rounded analyst forecasts of operating income, net income, and sales are associated with analyst``s forecast characteristics. Third, rounded analyst forecast of operating income, net income, and sales are less accurate and the negative relation between rounding and forecast accuracy respectively. And market participants showed a negative reaction to the consensus forecasts that includes rounding analysts of operating income, net income, and sales. These findings are very interesting and provide investors, academics, and practitioners with valuable insights into analysts forecasts`` numeric attribute. And this paper contributes to Korean financial analysts`` forecast literature by showing that analysts act in a rational way in the market."

This article: (a) first discusses Article 10(b) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5, both of which seem to have affected the interpretation by market participants of Article 174 of the Capital Markets Act of Korea; and (b) examines the attitude of U.S. courts with regard to insider trading in mutual funds. Although U.S. courts have held that the fiduciary duty and misappropriation theories are valid bases for regulating insider trading, as represented respectively in the cases of Dirks (1983) and O’Hagan (1997), they have been quite reluctant to apply these traditional theories to cases involving insider trading in mutual funds. Such position was even more pronounced in cases where the broker is not in an informant-recipient relationship with a mutual fund, for instance when the broker traded based on mutual fund arbitrage, portfolio information, or redemption information.The rationale behind U.S. courts’ passive approach is their observation that: (a) access to insider information on a mutual fund’s holdings by itself is insufficient to ensure successful insider trades of shares issued by the fund; (b) the fact that by law a mutual fund’s share price is determined by the fund’s net asset value per share each business day makes it quite difficult for anyone to profit from trading mutual fund shares on insider information; and (c) the public is in a position to gain considerable knowledge of a mutual fund’s operation by their access to key information on a mutual fund’s holdings, such as net redemptions and decrease in net asset value, through the fund’s prospectus and reports, as well as numerous investor magazines and newsletters covering such funds. Such stance taken by U.S. courts is reaffirmed in the recent Heartland Fund case (2014).In regulating insider trading by applying Article 174, on insider trading, and Article 178(2), on prohibition of activities likely to cause fluctuation in the marketplace, to cases involving insider trading in collective investment schemes, Korean courts may well take account of the aspirations demonstrated in U.S. court precedents. The reason is that in Korea, there has scarcely been any filing of a lawsuit involving conventional insider trading in a collective investment scheme, nor any case reported thus far involving arbitrage activities of a collective investment scheme, use of confidential information of portfolio holdings, or inside information on redemption of a collective scheme. Subjecting all financial investment companies to a “one size fits all” approach under the Capital Markets Act may inevitably lead to over-regulation. To address such a problem, it is necessary to advance an interpretive theory with regard to collective investment schemes and their securities, as distinct from that applicable to regulation of insider trading in other types of corporations and their securities."

The simulation based on the actual tax system of each country for its median income household shows that the net return on pension is smaller in Korea than that of the United States and the United Kingdom, when their fund is invested in the stock market. Korea provides tax incentives on corporate pension when collecting premium, but not when accumulating funds, as it is not considered to be capital gains on stocks. On the other hand, most other countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, give tax incentives on capital gains on stock, invested through corporate pension fund. This paper shows that under the current system, there is no tax benefits from investing in stocks, compared to investing in fixed income products. This may lead the workers to under-investment in corporate pension, than those in other countries. The rapid population aging increases the need for programs that guarantee retirement income. Therefore, the establishment of corporate pension, as well as the national pension, system is urgent. Capital gains and pension-related income tax reform can help retired workers to receive enough pension. In additional, I simulate the effective tax benefits across different income groups. The income group with the highest marginal tax rate receives six time higher tax benefit compared to that with the lowest marginal tax rate."

analysis of association between norepinephrine transporter gene polymorphisms and personality traits of neo-ffi in a japanese population,2015,"['Norepinephrine transporter', 'Gene polymorphism', 'NEO-FFI', 'Personality']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"ObjectiveaaNorepinephrine is an important chemical messenger that is involved in mood and stress in humans, and is reabsorbed by the norepinephrine transporter (NET). According to Cloninger’s theory, the noradrenergic system mediates the personality trait of reward dependence. Thus far, although association studies on NET gene polymorphisms and Cloninger’s personality traits have been reported, they yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, in the present study we investigated whether or not the 1287G/A, -182T/C and -3081A/T polymorphisms of the NET gene (SLC6A2) are associated with reward dependence-related traits, as assessed by the five-factor model.MethodsaaAfter written informed consent was obtained from participants, the three NET gene polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and personality was assessed by the Neuroticism Extraversion Openness-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) in 270 Japanese university students.ResultsaaA significant relation was found between the -3081A/T functional promoter polymorphism and NEO-FFI scores: those with the T allele exhibited a lower extraversion (E) score than those without the T allele (Mann-Whitney U-test: z=-3.861, p<0.001). However, there was no correlation between the other NET gene polymorphisms and E score, and no association with other dimensions and these three polymorphisms.ConclusionaaWe conclude that the -3081A/T functional polymorphism in the NET gene may affect the extraversion of reward dependence- related traits, as measured by NEO-FFI. However, we used only the shortened version of NEO-PI-R in this study. Further investigations are necessary using the full version of self-rating personality questionnaires."

However, today we face several problems, and thus should identify development motives and seek counter measures for sustainable development. This study is in line with such call for new measurements. The study reviews the theoretical background of aquaculture industry’s development process, and classifies the development process based on the amount of laver production. It also analyzes the development process practically. The results show that the aquaculture ground extension and technical development contributed to the increase of laver production before 2000. However, ever since then, ground extension had no contribution to the increase of laver production. Therefore we should to develope aquaculture techniques and enlarge the market.

The Community Currency is a new local community movement mainly experimented in the UK, Australia, the U.S. and Canada and it is also implemented in over 2,000 countries of Europe, South America, and Asia. As part of the efforts to organize the trading of labor services and products with the medium of virtual community currency, the Community Currency Movement tries to systematize the structure to give and take the goods and services without involving any money among the members. Given that the Community Currency Movement has an enough room to approach from the complementary perspectives on the development of regional society and the formation of local community, it is to suggest a new type of community currency keeping up with the times. The model for this study can be defined as part of a regional society welfare project based on the community currency.

the crisis of korean catholic church in the post-secular society: in the light of the legitimacy crisis,2015,"['Post-Secular', 'the Korean Catholic Church', 'Secularization', 'Legitimacy', 'Authenticity', '한국 천주교회', '세속화', '포스트-세속', '정당성', '진정성.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"What can the Korean Catholic Church say about the ‘Church crisis’? This article tries to answer this question by reconsidering secularization from the perspective of the sociology of religion, borrowing Habermas’ concepts of legitimacy crisis and post-secular society and reflecting on theological issues in the light of the Second Vatican Council.First, the sociological theory of secularization, reflecting on the Church’s legitimacy and crisis in Western European societies, constitutes institutional differentiation, cosmic-symbolic invalidity of religion, and the privatization of religion as the relevance of religion has weakened for modern individuals’ life-worlds. It is consequently related to ‘declining religious authority’. In particular, the Church crisis in Europe and the U.S. includes individual priests’ immorality (i.e., pedophilia), a lack of institu-tional accountability and organizational responsibility on the part of the Church, and social distrust of the Church. However, the Church crisis as social phenomena needs to be understood in the post-secular social con-text in which religion has not lost its power in the public sphere and the religious and the secular are in conflict. The primary task of the Church is to bear witness to the ‘fullness of life’ or ‘happiness’ in the immanent frame.Symptoms of the legitimacy crisis in the Korean Catholic Church can be found in both institutional churches and clericalism. On the one hand, some institutional churches reveal CEO styles of secular triumphalism based on ‘spiritual worldliness’. The bureaucratic governance of the Church appears to be of the ancien régime, not of the current society of information and networks in which people aspire toward de-authoritarian, horizontal communication. On the other hand, the problems of clericalism include the human immaturity of church leadership, the lack of authen-ticity and spiritual sensibilities in priesthood, the patriarchal culture of gender inequality, and the lack of collaborative, caring communities/net-works among clergy and the religious.This article suggests multi-dimensional conversion as pastoral alterna-tives in response to the problem of the Church crisis. Church leaders (bishops, priests, religious, and lay) need to recover ‘inner authority’ through sincerity and authenticity at an individual level. ‘Companionship of empowerment’ as an antidote to clericalism can help the Church to bear witness to the Heavenly Kingdom at a communal/organizational level. Prophetic commitment requires liminality from the center to the periphery at a social level. Finally and most importantly, the Church needs to put its initiatives into the hands of God following the guidance of the Holy Spirit."
does conditional conservatism affect credit ratings?: an analysis of korean krx bond issuers,2015,"['조건부 보수주의', '신용등급', 'Basu 모형', 'Ball and Shivakumar 모형', '투자등급', 'Conditional Conservatism', 'Credit Ratings', 'Basu Model', 'Ball and Shivakumar Model', 'Investment Grade']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We examine whether there is a relationship between conditional conservatism and credit ratings. Credit rating levels are the ‘opinion‘ of credit rating agencies about a firm’s default risk based on financial statements data and corporate governance information. In South Korea, credit rating levels are issued by National Information & Credit Evaluation (NICE), Korea Investor Services (KIS), Korea Ratings (KR) and Seoul Credit Rating & Information (SCI), and are used by bond investors, debt issuers, and governmental officials for decision making and legislative purposes. Accounting practices such as conditional conservatism have the potential to signal low default risk and financial stability. Accounting conservatism reflects a manager’s tendency to recognize “bad news” in a timelier manner than “good news” (Basu, 1997). The academic community continues to debate the merits of conservatism. However, the majority of studies suggest that conditional conservatism is an accounting practice with the potential to increase accounting quality (Watts, 2003; Roychowdhury and Watts, 2007; Ball and Kothari, 2008). In the U. S., numerous studies find an association between level of conservatism and credit ratings (Ahmed et al., 2002; Moerman (2006); Nikolaev (2007); Bauwhede (2007): Zhang, 2008; Peek 2010). Therefore, in the U.S., there is evidence to suggest that credit ratings agencies care about conditional conservatism as an accounting practice with the potential to influence default risk.In South Korea, there is evidence of a positive relation between accounting conservatism levels and credit ratings (Park et al., 2011). However, the association between credit rating changes and financial conservatism is a question left unanswered. Our motivation is to address this caveat. To our knowledge, our study is the first to analyze the association between conditional conservatism and credit ratings and credit rating changes using the two most popular conditional conservatism measures. We contribute to the literature by providing an evidence that conditional conservatism may influence a credit rating agency’s perception of default risk.We  examine if conditional conservatism is associated with credit ratings based on the following; conditional conservatism is an accounting practice associated with reducing a manager‘s ability to 'inflate' net income; hence, constraining dividend has the potential to reduce a credit rating agency’s perception of  risk.  Credit rating agencies issue higher credit ratings to firms with lower default risk. Thus, because firms care deeply about maintaining or increasing their credit ratings,  conservative reporting should have a positive a relation with credit rating levels / credit ratings changes. We perform numerous tests to establish the relation between conditional conservatism and credit ratings / credit rating changes. We investigate the relationship between a firm's credit ratings / credit ratings changes and conditional conservatism using a KRX firm sample of 1,310 firm-years from 2002 to 2013. First, we establish the levels of conditional conservatism using the accruals based Ball and Shivakumar (2005) and the market based Basu (1997) models. The results suggest that firms borrow equity in the form of public debt are conservative, consistent with previous studies.  Next, we use a dummy variable approach to examine the relationship between conservatism and credit ratings for investment / non-investment grade firms.  We find that investment and non-investment grade firms have statistically insignificantly different levels of financial conservatism.Thirdly, we test if conditional conservatism has a statistically significant relation with credit rating changes. We find that firms that experience an increase or a decrease in their credit rating levels from period t to t+1 are marginally more conservative compared to firms with consistent credit rating levels.

For young firms, access to credit for business growth can mean the difference between survival and failure. Equity crowdfunding is an innovative means of raising capital for businesses. Crowdfunding campaigns can give new business access to a large pool of investors. This brings huge benefits for marketing and increase provability of success of business and ROI, so it leads follow-on investment from Venture Capital and Angel investors. In Korea, the survival rate of startups and average growth rate of survivors is far lower than those of the U.S or other countries due to lack of funds for startup or early business growth. Equity crowdfunding can be a new funding source for venture or startups. It can increase startup and survival rate, in addition to the growth rate of survivors, resulting in decreased unemployment rate. In Korea, Equity crowdfunding will be available from 2016. Further study is needed to determine whether the impact of crowdfunding in Korea on job creation will be similar to its impact in the U.S."

Accordingly, various smart devices, such as a smart phone, Tablet PC is utilized in the medical information system. Also, these environments consist of various applications executing on heterogeneous sensors, devices, systems and networks. In these hospital information system environment, applying a security service by traditional access control method cause a problems. Most of the existing security system uses the access control list structure. It is only permitted access defined by an access control matrix such as client name, service object method name. The major problem with the static approach cannot quickly adapt to changed situations. Hence, we needs to new security mechanisms which provides more flexible and can be easily adapted to various environments with very different security requirements. In addition, for addressing the changing of service medical treatment of the patient, the researching is needed. In this paper, we suggest a dynamic approach to medical information systems in smart mobile environments. We focus on how to access medical information systems according to dynamic access control methods based on the existence of the hospital`s information system environments. The physical environments consist of a mobile x-ray imaging devices, dedicated mobile/general smart devices, PACS, EMR server and authorization server. The software environment was developed based on the .Net Framework for synchronization and monitoring services based on mobile X-ray imaging equipment Windows7 OS. And dedicated a smart device application, we implemented a dynamic access services through JSP and Java SDK is based on the Android OS. PACS and mobile X-ray image devices in hospital, medical information between the dedicated smart devices are based on the DICOM medical image standard information. In addition, EMR information is based on H7. In order to providing dynamic access control service, we classify the context of the patients according to conditions of bio-information such as oxygen saturation, heart rate, BP and body temperature etc. It shows event trace diagrams which divided into two parts like general situation, emergency situation. And, we designed the dynamic approach of the medical care information by authentication method. The authentication Information are contained ID/PWD, the roles, position and working hours, emergency certification codes for emergency patients. General situations of dynamic access control method may have access to medical information by the value of the authentication information. In the case of an emergency, was to have access to medical information by an emergency code, without the authentication information. And, we constructed the medical information integration database scheme that is consist medical information, patient, medical staff and medical image information according to medical information standards.y Finally, we show the usefulness of the dynamic access application service based on the smart devices for execution results of the proposed system according to patient contexts such as general and emergency situation. Especially, the proposed systems are providing effective medical information services with smart devices in emergency situation by dynamic access control methods. As results, we expect the proposed systems to be useful for u-hospital information systems and services."

I look into both internal and external macroeconomic factors relating to the bond markets, and for the Korean government bond market, I focus on the differential effect according to the nationality of foreign investors. The main empirical results can be summarized as follows. First, the bail-out financing related news increased the sovereign bond spreads of the PIIGS countries. In addition, the local financial vulnerability and global risk are also factored in. Second, the macroeconomic variables such as the ratios of government debt and fiscal balance to GDP affected bond yields. Global liquidity risk and inflation risk turned out to be relevant factors. Third, U.S. investors in the Korean government bonds consider arbitrage incentive and liquidity risk as important factor, but Eurozone and Chinese investors consider Korea``s sovereign credit risk. Fourth, relative yield increase in Korean short-term bonds leads to foreign investors`` net purchases. Fifth, increases in net purchases of Korean bonds by U.S. and Eurozone investors give rise to decrease in the yield, but Chinese investors do not. Sixth, the effect of foreign investors`` net purchases on bond yields is significant only for short-term bond purchases. The result implies that crises in industrialized countries have an indirect or spill-over effect on emerging market countries`` bond markets, and further that economic fundamentals and conventional bond market risks such as sovereign, liquidity and inflation risks are relevant."

Derivatives are traded by 26.22% of equity funds in our sample, which consists of all equity funds in Korea for 12 years between 2002 and 2013. We find that fund age and sales fee are key factors to determine the use of derivatives by equity funds. Our results show that equity funds with a higher sales fee and a higher age are more likely to utilize derivatives. We adopt various risk measures (e.g., the standard deviation of stock returns, market beta, idiosyncratic risk, downside beta, skewness, and kurtosis) to strengthen the robustness of our results. As a result, we find that derivative users present significantly lower levels of risk than non-users after controlling for firms’ characteristics, suggesting that the main purpose of derivatives use is to reduce fund risk. However, derivative users do not exhibit significantly higher performance after controlling for net asset values, sales fees, and other control variables. To quantify fund performance accurately, we construct performance measures including the average excess return, the Sharpe ratio, the alphas calculated by several asset pricing models (e.g., the market model, the Fama-French 3 factor model, the Treynor and Mazuy (1966) model, and the Henriksson and Merton (1981) model). Our findings are consistent with Chen (2011) based on hedge funds in the U.S. and not consistent with Koski and Pontiff (1999) based on mutual funds. We further study the effect of derivative trading on fund risk before and after the 2008 financial crisis and confirm that the use of derivatives has a significant impact on the level of fund risk only after the crisis. Accordingly, our findings imply that professional fund managers start to manage the level of risk using derivatives after experiencing the crisis."

Supreme Court Decision 2012Du11836, dated June 26, 2014, held that if a U.S. entity was fiscally transparent for the purpose of taxation in U.S., it was entitled to tax benefits under the Korea-U.S. tax treaty as a resident only to the extent its members were subject to U.S. tax, even though the entity itself was treated as a foreign corporation under Korean tax law. The Supreme Court is known to maintain a view that is different from the entity classification stated in the OECD Partnership Report, but as shown in the recent decision, the Supreme Court’s analysis reaches the same outcome as that in the OECD Partnership Report.  In Supreme Court Decision 2012Du18356, dated November 27, 2014, the Supreme Court concluded that the royalty paid for the use of patents from a Korean company to a U.S. corporation was not Korean source income in the context of the Korea-U.S. tax treaty, if the patent had not been registered in Korea. However, the author disagrees with the conclusion, because this decision disregards Article 93 (9) of the Corporation Income Tax Law, newly inserted in December 26, 2008, establishing the place of source rule for royalty income.  Supreme Court Decision 2012Du1747, 1757, dated September 4, 2014 and 2012Du23341, dated August 20, 2014, ruled that NTS had the burden to prove that the arm’s length price was calculated reasonably following the transactional net margin method. This decision appears to maintain the position held by previous decisions that the burden of proof for showing the tax assessment’s legality lays upon the NTS.  Supreme Court Decision 2012Du16466, dated July 10, 2014, is in accordance with the precedent decisions that substance-over-form doctrine can be applied in the interpretation of a tax treaty. Also, this decision points out some significant factors when applying substance-over-form doctrine. For example, a parent company which owns the entire shares of its subsidiary can control the subsidiary’s business management or decision making as a shareholder, but this does not directly mean that the parent is a substantial owner of the subsidiary’s income only for that reason, and the nature of holding company should be considered when applying the doctrine.  Seoul High Court Decision 2013Nu534026, dated May 28, 2014, ruled that a taxpayer is eligible for tax sparing credit if he/she was exempted from dividend income tax in China based on the differential limited tax rate of Korea-China tax treaty. However, this conclusion is questionable, because the purpose and intent of tax sparing credit and differential limited tax rate system are wholly different. Regarding this issue, further Supreme Court decisions may be necessary to clarify the problem."

Furthermore, such top management’s tone about corporate culture or risk tolerance are also most effectively implemented into a firm``s business strategy. Accordingly, it might be inferred that there is some association between a firm``s business strategy and its tax strategy. While many studies are investigating what can more explain reasons or motivations for tax avoidance, a firm’s business strategy may provide the approach which is more comprehensive and generalizable across industries than those specific individual variables previously considered for tax avoidance. The business strategy provides a theoretical background for an even broader understanding of the factors that are ex ante determinants of tax avoidance level. Ittner et al. (1997), Higgins et al. (2015) and Bentley et al. (2013) are main prior accounting researches that used a comprehensive and composite measure of business strategy as an explanatory variables. Such prior research are all based on Miles and Snow(1978, 2003)’s strategy theory. According to the Miles and Snow(1978, 2003), prospectors focus on innovation, pursue new products and geographic markets and are more likely to be aggressive, which have relatively more tax planning opportunities. Further, given that their products tend not to have readily available substitutes, prospectors are less concerned about negative publicity arising from tax avoidance. By contrast, defenders focus on comparatively sound, stable and predictable areas and put the stress on the economy of scale. defenders`` aversion to risk and uncertainty also suggests that given the set of tax opportunities available, they would avoid tax less aggressively. Since their products have viable substitutes, defenders could incur reputation costs associated with tax avoidance. Using the Miles and Snow(1978, 2003) theoretical business strategy framework, this study examines the relation between the aggressiveness of a firm’s business strategy and tax avoidance level for the Korean listed companies. We first investigate whether a firm’s business strategy aggressiveness is associated with its level of tax avoidance and predict that firms close to prospector engage in more tax aggressive behaviors than those close to defender(Hypothesis 1). Next, we investigate the association between a firm’s business strategy aggressiveness and volatility of firms’ tax avoidance and predict that the firms close to prospector have more volatility in their measures of tax avoidance than those close to defender(Hypothesis 2). We finally investigate the fact that a firm is a small and medium-sized enterprise under the Korean law affect the association between business strategy and the level of tax avoidance. To address our research questions, we used four alternative tax avoidance measures (the book and cash effective tax rate, BTD and DD BTD. We also compute a discrete STRATEGY composite index measure(STRATEGY_INDEX), which proxies for a firm’s business strategy aggressiveness. This measure is based on variables from prior literature (e.g., Ittner et al. 1997; Bentley, et al. 2013 and Higgins et al. 2015) that reflect different facets of this strategy: (1) the ratio of research and development to sales, (2) the ratio of employees to sales, (3) a growth opportunity measure (market-to-book ratio), (4) the ratio of marketing (SG&A) to sales, (5) employee fluctuations (standard deviation of total employees), and (6) capital intensity (net PPE scaled by total assets). Each of the six measures is intended to capture different elements of a firm’s business strategy. We find from the test of Hypothesis 1 that four (4) measures of tax avoidance level have positive (+) associations with the business strategy aggressiveness, which is consistent with our prediction. From the test of Hypothesis 2, we also find that the association between a firm’s business strategy aggressiveness and volatility of firms’ tax avoidance is positive (+) for all measures, provided that statistical significance is found only for two tax avoidance measures(BOOK_ETR and CASH_ETR). The test of Hypothesis 3 indicates that a small and medium-sized enterprise(SME) reduces the positive (+) the association between the business strategy aggressiveness and tax avoidance level. The results above suggest that a firm with aggressive business strategy engages in more aggressive tax avoidance activities since it pursues new product and new geographic markets entailing more tax avoidance planning opportunities. However, such aggressive tax avoidance activities are comparatively weaker in small and medium-sized firms than large firms even if they are pursuing aggressive business strategy. Our study is distinct from the prior tax literature (i.e., Higgins et al. 2015) in several ways: First, we separate SMEs from non-SMEs at the same level of business strategy, and we found that the level of tax avoidance of SMEs is lower than that of non-SMEs. Second, this study is for the Korean firms which are affected by the Korean specific management system and tax regime that are different from those of U.S. This study considered the Korean specific situations (e.g., 2009 is excluded from the sample due to the external shock (i.e., international financial crisis) and other control variables such as operating cash flow(OCFS), management ownership(MOWN) and foreign investor‘s shareholding(FSH) and SMEs(SMS) which are associated with tax avoidance under prior Korean researches. Third, we conducted both one (1) dummy regression model using samples of only prospector and defender group and the continuous variable model rather than 2-dummies regression model used by Higgins et al. (2015). Fourth, we conducted a robust test to investigate whether 6 facets composing the strategy are endogenously related with the tax avoidance level and factor analysis to test whether our strategy index is much stronger than the common factor. This research is important because it helps provide a better understanding of the factors that affect a firm’s propensity to engage in aggressive tax avoidance behavior. The distinguishing feature of our study is that it is grounded in a theoretical framework that is used to make clear predictions regarding the link between the aggressiveness of a firm’s business strategy and its tax aggressiveness."

One is for calculating the number of firms by total revenue minus total expense and the other is for calculating the number of firms using distributable amount deduct qualifying distribution amount. Firms (316 of samples) that total revenue deducting total expense was positive value recorded income in 2013. Firms (379 of samples) with negative value recorded loss in 2013. Moreover, firms with positive value of distributable amount deducting qualifying distribution amount, then firms under-distributed their expense through the year. Firms with negative value means over-distributed their expense through the year. Our results the number of under-distributed firms was 351, and over-distributed firms was 344. Among the total samples, firms with over-distributing and net loss accounted for 220 (31.65% of the samples) means they operated organizations in the foremost ways under the difficult financial situation.

With establishing sound financial structure and diversifying revenue structure, scholarship foundations can be encouraged to do more their scholarship businesses.  This study is based on the example of the United States. It may be contributed to the problem exists in the national scholarship fund requiring a more transparent and proactive in seeking ways to take advantage of the operational aspects in Korea.  The sample size of our study constraint as well as limitation of availability and data collection exist. Therefore, it is considered that future research required in the more leverage the research methodological approach of the other side with a lot of samples."

It turns out that urban population ratio, energy efficiency, net energy import, and political equality have a positive effect on EKC, while import to GDP ratio and secondary industry share have a negative effect on EKC."

To foster such imperialist policies, France’s policy makers regarded French companies operating in East Asia as instrumental. One such firm was Auguste Raphael Marty’s Tonkin Shipping Company, based in Haiphong, French Indochina, which operated steam coasters across the wider Gulf of Tonkin region. In the region’s highly competitive shipping market, Marty strived to achieve a monopoly when favorable conditions permitted during the final phase of the Sino-Japanese War. His profit-driven strategy caused huge losses for Chinese shippers and ultimately resulted in their boycotting his ships through the Tsap Yet syndicate. When French officials intervened on Marty’s behalf in negotiations with the Chinese government, the Syndicate was finally dissolved. It was followed by an agreement between the Chinese firm of Yuen Cheong Lee and Co. and the German firm of Jebsen and Co., based on long-established mutual trust between the owners. Although Marty received monetary compensation for his losses, he ruined his relationship with Chinese merchants.

reconstruction of the in-plane mode shape of a rotating tire with a continuous scanning measurement using the hilbert-huang transform.,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Generally, the dynamic characteristics (natural frequency, damping, and mode shape) of a structure can be estimated by experimental modal analysis. Among these dynamic characteristics, mode shape requires multiple measurements of the structure at different positions, which increases the experimental cost and time. Recently, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) method has been introduced to extract mode-shape information from a continuous measurement, which requires vibration measurements from one position to another position continuously with a non-contact sensor. In this research study, an effort has been made to estimate the mode shapes of a rolling tire with a single measurement instead of using the conventional experimental setup (i.e., measurement of the vibration of a rolling tire at multiple positions similar to the case of a non-rotating structure), which is used to estimate the dynamic behavior of a rolling tire. For this purpose, HHT, which was used in the continuous measurement of a non-rotating structure in previous research studies, has been used for the case of a rotating system in this study. Ambiguous mode combinations can occur in this rotating system, and therefore, a method to overcome this ambiguity is proposed in this study. In addition, the specific phenomenon for a rotating system is introduced, and the effect of this phenomenon with regard to the obtained results through HHT is investigated.</P>"
"multiple redox modes in the reversible lithiation of high-capacity, peierls-distorted vanadium sulfide",2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Vanadium sulfide VS<SUB>4</SUB> in the patronite mineral structure is a linear chain compound comprising vanadium atoms coordinated by disulfide anions [S<SUB>2</SUB>]<SUP>2–</SUP>. <SUP>51</SUP>V NMR shows that the material, despite having V formally in the d<SUP>1</SUP> configuration, is diamagnetic, suggesting potential dimerization through metal–metal bonding associated with a Peierls distortion of the linear chains. This is supported by density functional calculations, and is also consistent with the observed alternation in V–V distances of 2.8 and 3.2 Å along the chains. Partial lithiation results in reduction of the disulfide ions to sulfide S<SUP>2–</SUP>, via an internal redox process whereby an electron from V<SUP>4+</SUP> is transferred to [S<SUB>2</SUB>]<SUP>2–</SUP> resulting in oxidation of V<SUP>4+</SUP> to V<SUP>5+</SUP> and reduction of the [S<SUB>2</SUB>]<SUP>2–</SUP> to S<SUP>2–</SUP> to form Li<SUB>3</SUB>VS<SUB>4</SUB> containing tetrahedral [VS<SUB>4</SUB>]<SUP>3–</SUP> anions.

Moreover, the accurate modal extraction of acoustic cavity is difficult due to the high damping condition of interior cabin. This paper describes experimental modal analysis methodology with multi-excitation sources to obtain accurate acoustic cavity modes in the interior cabin of vehicle.

The resistance of the Pt nanowire arrays significantly decreased upon exposure to H<SUB>2</SUB> due to reduced electron scattering in the cross section of the hydrogen adsorbed Pt nanowires, as compared to the oxygen terminated original state.

Switching loss reduction results not only from the exemption of discharging the large output capacitance of GaN HEMT at high voltage, but also from the fact that parasitic inductance has much less effects on switching loss in GaN HEMT in BCM-VS than in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM). Limitations and design tradeoffs when GaN HEMT is applied in BCM-VS are also revealed. Forward voltage of GaN HEMT in reverse conduction is high and its conduction should be prevented when Vout〉 to achieve conduction loss reduction. This further loss reduction can be realized by switching on transistor before valley point. Besides, in BCM-VS, overvoltage on GaN HEMT is larger and oscillatory energy dissipation in circuit is higher than in CCM due to higher turn off current. Paralleling external capacitor to the transistor helps to ease voltage stress; however turn on loss will be increased. This loss increase is more severe in the case of Vout〈2Vin than Vout〉2Vin. Trade-offs on the selection of proper external capacitor value exists between increased switching loss and reduced voltage stress. Experimental setup is built to verify and demonstrate the analysis."
"fabrication, structure and hydrogen-gas-sensing properties of multiple networked gan nanostructure gas sensors",2015,"['GaN', 'Nanostructure', 'Gas sensor', 'Hydrogen']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"The controlled synthesis of nanostructures with different shapes and morphologies has attractedconsiderable interest because the sensing properties of nanostructures depend on their structure,shape, phase, size, and size distribution, as well as their composition. This paper compares theresponses of GaN nanostructures with different morphologies to hydrogen. The underlying mechanismfor the hydrogen gas sensing of the multiple networked GaN nanowire sensor can be explainedbased on the well-established surface depletion model. On the other hand, the difference betweentwo different samples, the GaN nanostructure sample synthesized at 1,100◦C and that synthesizedat 1,000◦C, could be explained as follows: The major process behind the interaction between thenanostructures and hydrogen is the chemisorption of the dissociated hydrogen on the GaN surface.The chemisorption creates an electron accumulation layer on the GaN surface that enhances itselectrical conductance. The GaN nanostructure sample synthesized at 1,100◦C with a higher ammoniaflow rate showed a higher response to H2 gas than that synthesized at 1,000◦C with a lowerammonia flow rate, which might be attributed to the higher surface-to-volume ratio of the former."

design of near-unity transmittance dielectric/ag/ito electrodes for gan-based light-emitting diodes,2015,"['Interference coatings', 'Thin films', 'Metal optics', 'Transparent conducting electrode']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"We designed a near-unity transmittance dielectric/Ag/ITO electrode for high-efficiency GaN-based lightemitting diodes by using the scattering matrix method. The transmittance of an ultrathin metal layer, sandwiched between a dielectric layer and an ITO layer, was investigated as a function of the thickness and the optical constant of each constituent layer. Three different metals (Ag, Au, and Al) were examined as the metal layer. The analytical simulation indicated that the transmittance of a dielectric/metal/ITO multilayer film is maximized with an approximately 10-nm-thick Ag layer. Additionally, the transmittance also tends to increase as the refractive index of the upper dielectric layer increases. By tailoring the thickness of the dielectric layer and the ITO layer, the dielectric/Ag/ITO structure yielded a transmittance of 0.97, which surpasses the maximum transmittance (0.91) of a single ITO film. Furthermore, this extraordinary transmittance was present for other visible wavelengths of light, including violet and green colors. A complex phasor diagram model confirmed that the transmittance of the dielectric/metal/ ITO multilayer film is influenced by the interference of reflected partial waves. These numerical findings underpin a rational design principle for metal-based multilayer films that are utilized as transparent electrodes for the development of efficient light-emitting diodes and solar cell devices."

The Si FET, SiC FET, and GaN FET are consecutively used with the prototype PFC rectifier, and the efficiency of the PFC rectifier with each different semiconductor switch is analyzed. An equivalent circuit model of the PFC rectifier, which incorporates all the internal losses of the PFC rectifier, is developed. The rms values of the current waveforms main circuit components are calculated. By adapting the rms current waveforms to the equivalent model, all the losses are broken down and individually analyzed to assess the conduction loss, switching loss, and magnetic loss in the PFC rectifier. This study revealed that the GaN FET offers the highest overall efficiency with the least loss among the three switching devices. The GaN FET yields 96% efficiency at 90 V input and 97.6% efficiency at 240 V, under full load condition. This paper also confirmed that the efficiency of the three switching devices largely depends on the turn-on resistance and parasitic capacitance of the respective switching devices."
impact of a drain field plate on the breakdown characteristics of alinn/gan moshemt,2015,"['MOSHEMT', 'AlInN/GaN', 'Passivation', 'Breakdown voltage', 'Drain field plate']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"In this paper, a novel AlInN/GaN metal oxide semiconductor high electron mobility transistor (MOSHEMT) employing the drain field plate technique is proposed and the effect of a drain field plate on the breakdown voltage (BV) is investigated. A reduction of the peak electric field is required to achieve AlInN/GaN MOSHEMTs with a high BV. The proposed AlInN/GaN MOSHEMT with both gate and drain field plates simultaneously reduces the electric field concentration at the gate and the drain edge by decreasing the potential gradient along the channel for the 2 dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The reduction in the peak electric field at the drain edge of the proposed device leads to a 57% increase in BV compared with the BV for an AlInN/GaN MOSHEMT with a gate field plate only. A significantly higher BV can be achieved by optimizing the gate-to-drain distance (Lgd), the length of the drain field plate (Ldfp) and the thickness of the SiN passivation layer thickness (TSiN). A detailed breakdown analysis of the device was carried out using Silvaco Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD). The detailed numerical simulations were done by using the non-local energy balance (EB) transport model, which was calibrated with the previously published experimental results. The results showed a great potential for applications of the drain-field-plated AlInN/GaN MOSHEMT to deliver high currents and high powers in microwave technologies."

The analysis of the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics demonstrated different mechanisms involved in the current charge transport in the LED device. Experimental admittance spectra have been investigated in broad frequency range, at various temperature and different direct current biases. A specific extraction of the quantum well conductance, based on Nicollian and Goetzberger’s model related to interface state conductance in Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor structure, has shown the effect of the quantum structure on the electric transport, and hence a correlation between the I-V electrical characteristics and the admittance spectroscopy has revealed the different conduction mechanisms involved in the charge transport in the InGaN/GaN LED. Activation energies and carrier capture velocity obtained from Arrhenius plots, determined from the thermally activated quantum well conductance peaks which are revealed with the used model, have confirmed that quantum well parameters are related to the carrier emission from confined levels in quantum wells."

investigation of fermi level pinning at semipolar (11-22) p-type gan surfaces,2015,"['Schottky contacts', 'Semipolar GaN', 'Barrier inhomogeneity model', 'Surface states']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Schottky barrier height (SBH; Φ<SUB>B</SUB>) and their dependence on the work function of metals (Φ<SUB>M</SUB>) at semipolar (11-22) p-GaN surfaces were investigated using Schottky diodes fabricated with different metals. The SBH increased with temperature, whereas the ideality factor decreased. This behavior was explained by means of the barrier inhomogeneity model, giving the mean barrier heights of 1.93-2.05eV for different metals. The S-parameter (dΦ<SUB>B</SUB>/dΦ<SUB>M</SUB>) was obtained to be 0.04. This small S-parameter implies that the surface Fermi level is nearly perfectly pinned at deep-level states (caused by vacancy-related and/or Mg-induced defects) located at 1.98eV above the valence band. This finding indicates that the surface modification is essentially required for the formation of high-quality ohmic and/or Schottky contacts."
frequency-dependent c-v characteristic-based extraction of interface trap density in normally-off gate-recessed algan/gan heterojunction field-effect transistors,2015,"['normally-off', 'gate-recessed', 'AlGaN/GaN HFETs', 'interface trap density', 'frequency-dependent C-V.']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"It is essential to acquire an accurate and simple technique for extracting the interface trap density (Dit) in order to characterize the normally-off gate-recessed AlGaN/GaN hetero field-effect transistors (HFETs) because they can undergo interface trap generation induced by the etch damage in each interfacial layer provoking the degradation of device performance as well as serious instability.

Biochemical analysis was performed for both serum and liver homogenate. Detailed intestinal flora and histological analyses were also carried out. Our results indicated that the administration of L. rhamnosus CCFM1107 significantly inhibited the increase in the levels of serum aminotransferase and endotoxin, as well as the levels of triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (CHO) in the serum and in the liver. Glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were elevated while the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were decreased. The enteric dysbiosis caused by alcohol was restored by increasing the numbers of both lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and decreasing the numbers of both enterococci and enterobacter. Histological analysis confirmed the protective effect of L. rhamnosus CCFM1107. Compared with the other lactobacilli and to the drug Hu-Gan-Pian, there is a high chance that L. rhamnosus CCFM1107 provides protective effects on alcoholic liver injury by reducing oxidative stress and restoring the intestinal flora."

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the toxicity profiling of graphene family nananomaterials (GFNs) in alternative in vitro and in vivo toxicity testing models.  Methods: The GFNs used in this study are graphene nanoplatelets ([GNPs]–pristine, carboxylate [COOH] and amide [NH2]) and graphene oxides (single layer [SLGO] and few layers [FLGO]). The human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas2B cells) as in vitro system and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as in vivo system were used to profile the toxicity response of GFNs. Cytotoxicity assays, colony formation assay for cellular toxicity and reproduction potentiality in C. elegans were used as end points to evaluate the GFNs’ toxicity.  Results: In general, GNPs exhibited higher toxicity than GOs in Beas2B cells, and among the GNPs the order of toxicity was pristine>NH2>COOH. Although the order of toxicity of the GNPs was maintained in C. elegans reproductive toxicity, but GOs were found to be more toxic in the worms than GNPs. In both systems, SLGO exhibited profoundly greater dose dependency than FLGO. The possible reason of their differential toxicity lay in their distinctive physicochemical characteristics and agglomeration behavior in the exposure media.  Conclusions: The present study revealed that the toxicity of GFNs is dependent on the graphene nanomaterial’s physical forms, surface functionalizations, number of layers, dose, time of exposure and obviously, on the alternative model systems used for toxicity assessment."

Many studies on query expansion with relationships from single local corpus suffer from two problems resulting in low retrieval performance: term relationships are limited and unlisted query terms have no expansion terms. To address these problems, relationships between terms captured from Wikipedia are superimposed to the basic Markov network that pre-built using single local corpus. A new larger Markov network is formed with more and richer relationship for each term. Evaluation is performed on three standard information retrieval corpuses including ADI, CISI and CACM.Experimental results show that the proposed technique of superimposed Markov network is effective to select more and confident candidatesfor query expansion and it outperforms other state-of-the-art QE methods."

depression and the risk of breast cancer: a meta-analysis of cohort studies,2015,"['Depression', 'breast cancer', 'meta-analysis']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Background: Whether depression causes increased risk of the development of breast cancer has long been debated. We conducted an updated meta-analysis of cohort studies to assess the association between depression and risk of breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Relevant literature was searched from Medline, Embase, Web of Science (up to April 2014) as well as manual searches of reference lists of selected publications. Cohort studies on the association between depression and breast cancer were included. Data abstraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two authors. Random-effect model was used to compute the pooled risk estimate. Visual inspection of a funnel plot, Begg rank correlation test and Egger linear regression test were used to evaluate the publication bias. Results: We identified eleven cohort studies (182,241 participants, 2,353 cases) with a follow-up duration ranging from 5 to 38 years. The pooled adjusted RR was 1.13(95% CI: 0.94 to 1.36; $I^2=67.2%$, p=0.001). The association between the risk of breast cancer and depression was consistent across subgroups. Visual inspection of funnel plot and Begg's and Egger's tests indicated no evidence of publication bias. Regarding limitations, a one-time assessment of depression with no measure of duration weakens the test of hypothesis. In addition, 8 different scales were used for the measurement of depression, potentially adding to the multiple conceptual problems concerned with the definition of depression. Conclusions: Available epidemiological evidence is insufficient to support a positive association between depression and breast cancer."

Jiang Qing(蔣慶), Yao Zhongqiu(姚中秋), Gan Chunsong(干春松), the representative exponents of Political Confucianism, criticize that Neo-confucianism, producted by Taiwan Neo-confucianists, do not concern the reality of China, just concentrates on the academic research, so call them ‘Mind Confucianism’, ‘the exhibit of museum’, ‘the history of philosophy’, ‘Ideal history’. Their alternative type to existing Confucianism, proposed by them, is so called ‘Political Confucianism’, ‘People’s Confucianism’, ‘Institutional Confucianism’. Their argument is connected to the idea of searching for Chinese model in the times of ‘The rise of China’. Neo-Confucianists in Chinese continent orient their Confucianism as the idea to overcome Western modernity and have difference to the Neo-Confucianism in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In January of 2015 Li Minghuei(李明輝), the successor of Neo-Confucianism in Taiwan, criticized the argument of Political Confucianism. His criticism cause the debate between the Confucianists of Chinese continent and Taiwan. Their debate revealed the difference of the view on the Neo-Confucianism and social context of both sides. Furthermore it is relevant to the view on modern Western political theories, Chinese modern history since New Culture Movement, based on pursuing Western modernity. The main point in criticizing Li Minghuei is that Li cannot understand the situation of China, insist that their Confucianism is the result of dealing with the Chinese situation. The hole process of argument and debates on Political Confucianism reveal that Chinese Confucianism have continued to develop, through searching for reinforcing its influence on Chinese reality."
investigation of wind-induced dynamic and aeroelastic effects on variable message signs,2015,"['aerodynamic drag', 'galloping', 'variable message sign', 'vortex shedding']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Tests were conducted at the Florida International University (FIU) Wall of Wind (WOW) to investigate the susceptibility of Variable Message Signs (VMS) to wind induced vibrations due to vortex shedding and galloping instability. Large scale VMS models were tested in turbulence representative of the high frequency end of the spectrum in a simulated suburban atmospheric boundary layer. Data was measured for the $0^{\circ}$ and $45^{\circ}$ horizontal wind approach directions and vertical attack angles ranging from $-4.5^{\circ}$ to $+4.5^{\circ}$. Analysis of the power spectrum of the fluctuating lift indicated that vertical vortex oscillations could be significant for VMS with a large depth ratio attached to a structure with a low natural frequency. Analysis of the galloping test data indicated that VMS with large depth ratios, greater than about 0.5, and low natural frequency could also be subject to galloping instability."

However, original CNN uses multiple hidden layers to extract features and uses fully-connected method with MLP(Multi-layer perceptron) on the result. Therefore, the major demerit of conventional CNN is to require a long time for training and testing. In this paper, we apply randomly-connected classifier instead of fully-connected classifier by combining random forest with output of 2 layers of CNN. We prove that the recognition results of CNN with random forest show best performance than recognition results of CNN with SVM (Support Vector Machine) or MLP classifier when we use eight speed-limit signs of GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)."

The Convolutional Neural Networks adopted in this paper has a very unique advantage when compared with conventional neural network models because CNNs do not require any feature extraction procedure prior to the classification process while other existing classification methods require rather very complex feature extraction process. Several CNN models are first designed as local classifiers and these models are then combined to make a decision in Classifier Integration Model for our classification task.

This article examined an English into Korean simultaneous interpretation by a non-professional interpreter to cover UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon’s speech on March 24, 2014. The interpreter who was a journalist working for a Korean TV station also tried to simultaneously interpret CNN’s breaking news at a TV studio and ended up a total failure last year. Although she did not sit at a TV studio this time, the reporter omitted a significant amount of the original speech leaving exceptionally long pauses, EVS and TTS in her interpretation. Particularly, the portion of concurrent listening and speaking which makes simultaneous interpretation very demanding was extremely low. As a result, the performance was nothing more than a poor random consecutive interpretation as the reporter produced one Korean sentence while paying no attention to the concurrently incoming messages and listened to the next segments without any utterance leaving long pauses. In spite of some assertions that translation and interpretation ability is a natural consequence of bilingualism, this case clearly attests that simultaneous interpretation, at least from English into Korean, should be carried out by professionals interpreters who acquired the ability to optimally allocate a limited capacity to several submodules of interpretation after a long and systematic training."

Therefore, this study was performed to investigate the feasibility of feeding broiler chickens a herb mixture comprising Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch (GUF), Eucommia ulmoides Oliver (EUO), and Solanumnigrum Linne (SNL) as an alternative to antibiotic supplements. The chickens were fed either the herb mixture, added to chicken feed in proportions of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5% or antibiotic supplements or neither. After 6 weeks, we evaluated weight gain, feed efficiency, carcass productivity, internal organ weight, and blood cholesterol level. All groups fed herb mixture showed significantly higher (p＜ 0.05) total weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion rate, and carcass weight than the other two groups. A pinkish red or lustrous, dark red color of the liver and bowel is considered an indicator of a healthy animal. This was observed in only 1 animal in the group that did not receive the herbal mixture; however, in groups that received 0.3% and 0.5% herbal mixture showed 11 animals with healthy pinkish red color of the liver. Additionally, compared to the group that received the herbal mixture, the serum levels of total protein and GPT were higher in the group that did not. Although more studies are required, these results indicate that the use of this herbal mixture may be considered an alternative to antibiotic supplements in livestock feed."

The incremental deep classification neural network was composed of stacked denoising autoencoder, incremental feature learning and support vector machine to achieve the feature-extracting and classification of particle set. Deep learning is successfully taken to express the image representations obtained effectively. Unsupervised feature learning is used to learn generic image features and transfer learning transforms knowledge from offline training to the online tracking process. The incremental feature learning was consisted of adding features and merging features to online learn compact feature set. Linear support vector machine increases the discretion for target with similar appearance and is further tuned to adapt to appearance changes of the moving object. Compared with the state-of-the-art trackers in the complex environment, the results of experiments on variant challenging image sequences show that incremental deep learning tracker solves the problem of existent trackers more efficiently, it has better robust and more accurate, especially for occlusions, background clutter, illumination changes and appearance changes."

In recent years, the growth of interest in the BCI field has led to the development of a number of useful applications, such as robot control, game interfaces, exoskeleton limbs, and so on. However, while imagined speech, which could be used for communication or military purpose devices, is one of the most exciting BCI applications, there are some problems in implementing the system. In the previous paper, we already handled some of the issues of imagined speech when using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), although it required complementation for multi class classification problems. In view of this point, this paper could provide a suitable solution for vowel classification for imagined speech. We used the DBN algorithm, which is known as a deep learning algorithm for multi-class vowel classification, and selected four vowel pronunciations:, /a/, /i/, /o/, /u/ from IPA. For the experiment, we obtained the required 32 channel raw electroencephalogram (EEG) data from three male subjects, and electrodes were placed on the scalp of the frontal lobe and both temporal lobes which are related to thinking and verbal function. Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the EEG data were used as the feature vector of each vowel. In the analysis, we provided the classification results of the back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) for making a comparison with DBN. As a result, the classification results from the BP-ANN were 52.04%, and the DBN was 87.96%. This means the DBN showed 35.92% better classification results in multi class imagined speech classification. In addition, the DBN spent much less time in whole computation time. In conclusion, the DBN algorithm is efficient in BCI system implementation."

We sought to identifyand describe perioperative complications and their management in connection with minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbodyfusion (TLIF).Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of our first 124 patients who underwent minimally invasive TLIF. The primaryoutcome measure was adverse events during the perioperative period, including neurovascular injury, implant-related complications,and wound infection. Pseudarthroses and adjacent segment pathologies were not included in this review. Adverse eventsthat were not specifically related to spinal surgery and did not affect recovery were also excluded.Results: Perioperative complications occurred in 9% of patients (11/124); including three cases of temporary postoperative neuralgia,two deep wound infections, two pedicle screw misplacements, two cage migrations, one dural tear, and one grafted boneextrusion. No neurologic deficits were reported. Eight complications occurred in the first one-third of the series and only 3 complicationsoccurred in the last two-thirds of the series. Additional surgeries were performed in 6% of patients (7/124); including fourreoperations (two for cage migrations, one for a misplaced screw, and one for an extruded graft bone fragment) and three hardwareremovals (one for a misplaced screw and two for infected cages).Conclusions: We found perioperative complications occurred more often in the early period of a surgeon's experience with minimallyinvasive TLIF. Implant-related complications were common and successfully managed by additional surgeries in this series.We suggest greater caution should be exercised to avoid the potential complications, especially when surgeon is a novice to thisprocedure."

nmf-based target source separation using deep neural network,2015,[],국문 초록 정보 없음,"<P>Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is one of the most well-known techniques that are applied to separate a desired source from mixture data. In the NMF framework, a collection of data is factorized into a basis matrix and an encoding matrix. The basis matrix for mixture data is usually constructed by augmenting the basis matrices for independent sources. However, target source separation with the concatenated basis matrix turns out to be problematic if there exists some overlap between the subspaces that the bases for the individual sources span. In this letter, we propose a novel approach to improve encoding vector estimation for target signal extraction. Estimating encoding vectors from the mixture data is viewed as a regression problem and a deep neural network (DNN) is used to learn the mapping between the mixture data and the corresponding encoding vectors. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments were conducted in the speech enhancement task. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional encoding vector estimation scheme.</P>"

These relationships may color the perceptions of teaching and learning experiences. This study has two major objectives. The first is to investigate the congruence or incongruence between approaches to teaching and approaches to learning. The second is to explore the presage and process factors affecting students’ perceptions of a course’s usefulness and their satisfaction with that course. In this study, 309 students from a Career Planning and Self-Development course voluntarily participated. The Approaches to Teaching Inventory-Revised (ATI-R) and Revised Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F) were used to investigate students’ perceived approaches to teaching and to learning. To investigate the factors that affected students’ satisfaction and their perceptions of the course’s usefulness, Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR) was used to explore the relationships among those factors. The results indicated that there was a strong congruence between students’ approaches to teaching and their approaches to learning. Interestingly, we found that students were more likely to adopt deep approaches to learning when they perceived that their instructors were adopting conceptual change/student-focused approaches to teaching. OLR analyses found that students’ perceptions of the course’s usefulness were closely related to their perceptions of the instructors’ conceptual change/student-focused approaches to teaching and soft/applied approaches to discipline. Students’ perceptions of the course’s usefulness were negatively related to their perceptions of the instructors’ information transmission/teacher-focused approaches to teaching. Students who majored in hard or applied science disciplines were more likely to perceive that the course was useful in planning their career paths. This study suggests that approaches to teaching and learning are relational and that the relationship between the approaches may have an impact on students’ satisfaction with the course and perceptions of its usefulness."

But It has been predominatingly evaluated that Tasan’s yaobian theory is not the universal method to interpret Zhouyi, because of only the method of his own.On this issue, looking into the yaobian appearing in the excavated Materials from chinese tomb and the past literatures, we could admit the yaobian to be a universal method to interpret Zhouyi, and Tasan’s method to find it also could be evidenced as a universal one.We find the evidences of yaobian from hexagrams composed of numbers in the excavated Materials, intensively implying the traces of yaobian. Subsequently, we gather the historical evidences that yaobian theory in ZuozhuanThe Commentary of Zou is connected to the Silk- Manuscript Yi from Ma Wang Dui, and once more to Jia Yi賈誼 and Jing Fang京房.

It is to say that the historical significances of Yi Learning on yaobian theorists is to find the yaobian method with examining the characteristics of Yi left in Old Classics and decisively apply it to the interpretation of Yi.It can be said that Tasan’s yaobian theory has the synchronic univer¬sality, it result from careful study and research on Old Classic relevant to Yi. Furthermore, Tasan’s yaobian theory has characteristics, which gives an important position to it, as distinct from other yaobian theorists.Tasan’s yaobian theory gives unique and twofold position to yaobian, which is included as one of the Four Core Methods and at the same time transcends them, and makes the Four Core Methods a organized system.

A Korean pop star- PSY has shaken the world with his hit song the “Kang Nam Style”. This became a big motivating factor for Koreans for proudly introducing Korean pop culture to the world. Korean composers have cultivated Korean arts song culture for more than 90 years.  Beginning of 20th century, Korea has opened its door to western culture, and since then numerous Korean arts songs were composed by Korean composers. <울밑에선 봉선화: Garden balsam under the shadow>, <명태>(Dried pollack), <그리운 금강산>(Longing for Mt. Keum Kang) are some examples. The researcher believes that now is the right time and moment to share that rich Korean arts song culture with the world. Main problems of sharing that rich Korean arts song culture with foreigners are two kinds, language barrier and lack of well-developed Korean arts song teaching & learning materials. Since the Korean is not the international language, it is really hard for the foreigners to understand the meaning of Korean arts song and to sing by listening to it alone.In this study, the writer proposed a carefully planned sequential approaches for world wide spreading of Korean arts songs. And the development of art song teaching & learning material is the starting point of the proposed procedures of spreading Korean arts songs out the world.Suggested Korean arts song teaching & learning material consisted of two types of sources, namely text(learning of music) and context(learning about the music and related culture). In the domain of text, music(with Korean and international phonetics text), song Mp3, lyric Mp3, and motion picture of actual performance of the song are included.

The results of the study showed that it is necessary for North Korean refugee students to have living connected language contents, Korean educational culture strengthened by new teaching approaches, English academic skills, and extra-curricular activities for improving their English abilities in South Korean educational context. This study not only suggests some implications for effective English teaching for North Korean refugee students today, but also sheds light on establishing decent plans for those who are learning English in the unified Korea’s English education system in the future."

In addition, an authentic precedent was decoded, so a teaching-learning direction was explored to be used in conformable work understanding and appreciating.  An authentic precedent is one of rhetoric to impart contents effectively and make image clear by using a word of leading text, and is also a rhetorical device contributing on artistic imagery or achievement of a literary work. Decoding of authentic precedent is a semantic understanding act based on communication principle ‘Intertextuality’. In a process of classical literature education, it is necessary to understand that such factor becomes an aesthetic factor of classical literature work.  An act using in interpretation and appreciation of a work by understanding an authentic precedent in a process of classical literature education has an educationally meaningful value and possibility in three aspects such as increase of an elegant linguistic ability, establishment of linguistic culture identity, and enjoyment of a work and aesthetic capability enhancement of creation.  An authentic precedent used in an individual work should place an emphasis on study as follows in a teaching-learning process according to the types. First, an authentic precedent focusing on the name of a thing should place an emphasis on understanding of a symbol individual word has. The core is making learners understand how characteristics of an object are verbalized and symbolized. Second, for an authentic precedent focusing on a figure, it is important to point out what is the interface between a historical figure and a writer, and what a writer wants to say through a historical figure. Third, an authentic precedent focusing on authority is in case of borrowing expression based on the Confucian classics and historical records, and it should be penetrated where the centroid of meaning relevant authentic precedent has is put by considering a context of work. Fourth, for an authentic precedent focusing on a subject, teaching-learning should be reached by focusing on structure and topicalization of a work.  If teachers do not know an authentic precedent in a process of classical literature education, they teach difficultly, but if they know an authentic precedent well, they can teach easily. To extricate from a swamp of excessive exposition of a teaching-learning process of classical literature, it is important that teachers understand characteristics by types of an authentic precedent based on a deep understanding of authentic precedent, so engage in teaching-learning with an emphasis on education to fit a level and a rank of learners."

More worse, such a minimal and wrong effort is only being made just during the exam period. Teachers want to make their students take a deep approach to learning, trying to make meaning of what they learned, not just for the exam period, but on a regular and steady basis. Most teachers consider quizzes/interview/homeworks to get to grips with this problem. These alternatives, however, usually turn out to be of little use in spite of the attendant heavy load for teachers. We devised a new teaching and learning tool, “Self-Reflection Note”, to solve the problem, which has been used in our lectures for several years. This note is a sort of students’ report about what they studied and learned on their own. The students are required to turn in the note every week, thereby studying the subect on a regular basis. They are expected to explain what they learned using their own language, consequently getting to take a deep approach to their learning. Teachers are able to monitor the students’ understanding/misunderstanding/confusion/failures, and give a pertinent feedback to the students. Using “Self-Reflection Note”, we have solved the problems for which the traditional alternatives were not that successful. Furthermore, the required time load of teachers is just about an hour per week for each course. This paper describes the educational effects of this novel tool as well as our experience of using it in our courses."

If we think about Hangul: Korean alphabet which is a scientific letter was made in a generation, dullness of the Chinese characters can even more be highlighted. However, it is this dullness and the honest effectiveness that give the Chinese characters power since it accumulates cultural meanings, especially the meaning of literature, history, and philosophy through concrete shapes and historical precipitations of long time.This study tries to attract the aspects of literature, history, and philosophy inherent in the Chinese characters and to devise a new way to learn Chinese characters that can suggest a humanistic vision. This can simply be summarized as follows.First, the author identified the advantages and disadvantages of existing books with regard to the education of Chinese characters. While books focusing on grades are useful in learning Chinese characters in a short period of time, they can easily neglect the cultural values. On the other hand, while books focusing on cultural aspects let people learn the cultural values based on rich expertise, they are not useful in learning the characters and lack perspective to creatively inherit and develop culture through Chinese characters.Second, the author found out that we need humanistic perspective to avoid disadvantages and encourage advantages. In other words, humanities can converge various cultures focusing on human and can be a foundation to create new culture. And the humanistic elements in the Chinese characters (literature, history, and philosophy) can lead to a more intensified learning.Third, the author investigated principles and ways to draw the elements of literature, history, and philosophy in the characters. Radicals that take the major part of the Chinese characters are like the archetype that determined the language and imagination of people since they are the embodiment of objects closely related to human life. Chinese characters are not only the mean to record history, but also the historical event and fruit encapsulating the perception on the past affairs. Chinese characters show us the world view and the thinking system of ancient people in the East in their composition principles or operational principles.Finally, the author suggested an education method using literature, history, and philosophy focusing on the word '人': human. In a historical perspective, it is highly likely that the word is the embodiment of a person who works while bending his waste forward. And in a literary point of view, there are two poems included as an example that show a deep reflection on human existence. In a philosophical view, the author suggested his view concerning the definition on human. And for the convenience to learn Chinese characters, the author emphasized that the Chinese characters are the essential elements to understand the concepts of Korean by specifying important Chinese characters in the description with regard to literature, history, and philosophy. After that, Chinese characters associated with the word '人' were presented.In conclusion, the purpose of this study that explored ways to configure textbooks for Chinese characters using literature, history, and philosophy is to find out cultural values hidden in Chinese characters and to couple them in to the education of humanities required by the era. While this cannot be a methodology with a clear and specific framework, this can be flexibly used depending on the diversity of majors of teachers and the understanding of learners."

research on the current status of college students of south korea in practising chinese kung fu lessons,2015,"['Chinese martial art', 'college students of South Korea', 'learning status']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Purpose: To understand and master current situation about college students of South Korea in learning Chinese martial arts courses, as well as real problem and environment about Chinese martial arts courses launched in universities of South Korea, to raise corresponding counter measures and suggestions on development of kung fu lessons in universities of South Korea, to promote the development of Kung Fu sports in universities of South Korea , to serve Internationalization of the Chinese Kung Fu sports. Method: This paper was based on a questionnaire survey which was made in Yongin Univerisity.119 questionnaires were distributed and all of them were taken back, and lastly effective rate is 100%. The survey was for getting familiar with current situation about how college students of South Korean are learning Chinese martial arts. Deep interview was made to know better about teaching and training situation of specific Chinese martial arts between teachers and students. Besides, through learning Chinese martial arts, we’d love to figure out some questions. For example: whether college students of South Korea can deepen the understanding of China, Chinese culture and Chinese martial arts or not? Whether they are more willing to learn Chinese culture and Chinese martial arts, as well as how do colleges and universities of South Korean promote Chinese martial arts in a more efficient way? Result: Few universities in South Korea are currently establishing Chinese martial arts courses, The development of sports of South Korea have private characteristics and their own way , so being foreign sports project in South Korea, promoting can be certain difficult, but the trend is very good; students are satisfied with teacher``s attitude and approach of teaching in the learning process, and also are able to understand the Chinese culture through learning martial arts, but what students learned about Chinese culture is vague, which are not clear and concrete, not to mention identity of Chinese culture, which are related with the forms of promotion of martial arts and means; While comparing with some specific sports like South Korea Taekwondo, Chinese martial arts is a lack of skill and difficult to learn the complex movement; but for most of the students, they are willing to keep on learning Chinese martial arts if there are any opportunity in the future. Conclusion: As Chinese martial arts became a formal event in some international competitions like the Asian Games and World University Games, as well as program of the Olympic Games martial arts of China, more and more countries have gradually realized the importance of China martial arts project, so it’s an inevitable trend that Chinese martial arts are established in universities of South Korea; The contents of teaching should be adaptive to the psychology and demand of college students of South Korea when Chinese martial arts are taught in universities of South Korea. Here are some examples: the martial arts project should be more simple, interesting and practical, and also a variety of teaching methods should be adopt in the process of teaching, such as the combination of theory and practice, the combination of music and video, and collective creation and performance of teaching content. This improvement will enhance the learning enthusiasm of stu- dents and achieve better teaching effect. In addition; it’s also another way of promoting Chinese culture when Chinese martial arts are more widely established in universities of South Korea, So Chinese culture should be deeply expressed in the dissemination contents of Chinese martial arts, methods of teaching and process of teaching and practicing. The nature of China martial arts should be raised as culture of arts, and eventually college students of South Korea will deeply grasp new Chinese ideas of culture."

We examined Hangul notation of Japanese vowel columns specifically choosing エ(e) column and ウ(u) column. We noticed the vast difference in Hangul notation of エ(e) column that ‘ㅕ, ㅖ’ were frequently shown before the 20th century while ‘p’ was more frequently noted in the early 20th century. ス, ズ, ツ, ヅin Hangul notation of ウ(u) column was marked as ‘ㅡ’ before the 20th century while marked as ‘ㅜ’ in the early 20th century along with ‘ㅡ’.  Hangul notation of consonants is discussed primarily concerning voiceless sounds, voiced sounds and p-sounds. When it comes to voiceless sounds, チ (?i), ツ(ts?) were fully examined. チwas marked as ‘지, 찌’ before the 20th century while marked as ‘지’ or ‘디’ in the early 20th century. ツwas marked ‘즈, 쯔, ?’ in the literature before the 20th century. The difference between prior to the 20th century and the early 20th century is that Japanese Learning Readers in noting ツas ‘쓰’ was marked only in the early 20th century.  Hangul notation of voiced sounds in literature were classified into five categories with some differences in detail (the category 1: 가, the category 2: ?, the category 3: ㅇ가, the category 4: 가?, the category 5: ?). The reason for the category 2 above is that consonants which can be differentiated in Korean can not be differentiated in Japanese such as tense sounds, and the opposite is true in case of voice consonants such as Japanese カ[ka], ガ[ga] which cannot be differentiated in Korean since they are noted with the same syllable 가[ka] and 가[ga]. The category 5 varies in different literature 『日話朝雋(Ilhwajojeon)』 and 『日本語學音·語編(Ilboneohak Eumeopyeon)』marked[＋nasal] feature and『無先生增補速修國語讀本(Museonsaeng Jeungbo Soksu Kukeodokbon』 noted [＋voice] feature.

At the same time, it plays an important role in understanding Korean education and sociocultural atmosphere. But there is not enough research on Hakwon education to take a deep look into it. Within this context, this paper was to scrutinize the characteristics of Korean students’ learning experiences in Hakwon education in chronological look and to identify the elementary school students’ viewpoint on their Hakwon experience. For this purpose, qualitative study methods were employed. In order to describe and understand how Hakwon education is operated, a variety of qualitative data collection methods such as participant observation, intensive interviewing and content analysis have been implemented for almost a year long field work study. Through these field-oriented methods, researchers were able to collect qualitative data to extensively show what kinds of features of Korean Hakwon education for elementary school students have in regard to curriculum, materials and teaching methodology in the concept of chronological steps. Also we were able to better understand the elementary school students’ thoughts and perspective on Hakwon experience. The discussion continued to evolve in the following phases. First, we clarified how much students took Hakwon education classes in Korea and what kind of education were provided in Hakwon. Subsequently, we described how the students got different aspects of educational experience by their school grade. And if we discerned any type of differences in that, we probed to find out the reasons in association with the public school curriculum and system. In addition, we described detailed learning experiences in a variety of Hakwons through a qualitative study of actual Hwakwon institutions and students. In addition, we examined what Hakwon means to elementary school students with no preconception involved. A series of follow-up courses can take us to a detailed look into the life of students in Hwakwon and will serve as an important opportunity for on-site school administrators and teachers to get to know the alternative way to overcome the school crisis and problems."

Poems reminiscing about the Baekje Dynasty refer to poems composed on the theme of remains, people, events, and history related to Baekje by those who visited the remains of the Baekje Dynasty including Buyeo, the last capital of Baekje. There are 44 extant poems reminiscing about the Baekje Dynasty written by 14 literary men in the 16th century including So Se-yang(蘇世讓). The contents of the poems are mostly about the vanity of history, and a few literary men such as Hwang Jun-ryang wrote poems satirizing the realities in those days but the number is small. The reasons are as follows. First, different from that in the 15th century, 16th-century Joseon was already rooted deeply into the Neo-Confucian value, the national founding ideology of Joseon, in various aspects of the state including politics, economy, and society. However, there were a series of political incidents including Gimyosahwa(己卯士禍: massacre of Confucian scholars in 1519) resulting from continuous political conflicts between aristocrats monopolizing power and wealth and those anxious for new politics. As a result, literary men’s interest in history was generally diminished far lower than that in the past. Second, as Neo-Confucianism was deepened and popularized in the 16th century, the Neo-Confucian view of history soaked into literary men unknowingly. The king had to attend the learning session[經筵] everyday and discussed Confucian texts and history with the subjects. The main textbooks of the learning session were Liujing[六經: the Six Classics] and Jachitonggamgangmok(資治通鑑綱目) reorganized by Chu-his. Jachitonggamgangmok is a book of Chinese history, not Korean, restructured from the Neo-Confucian viewpoint based on existing Chinese history books. Therefore, literary men versed in Jachitonggamgangmok, namely, Chinese history but did not have keen interest in and deep knowledge of Korean history. Third, because there were not works for organizing Korean history in those days, the knowledge of Baekje history could not go beyond the records in Samguksagi, and people’s perception of Baekje history was negative. For these reasons, there were not many poets and poems revealing reminiscent emotions on Baekje history compared to those in the early period of the Joseon Dynasty, and most of written poems expressed the vanity of history irrelevant to the realities in those days. Only few literary men including Hwang Jun-ryang exposed their sentiment of lamentation and admonition in their poems, which criticized King Euija and adored Seongchung from the viewpoint of ultimate governing ideology[至治主義]."
organic small molecules functionalized blue light-emitting electrochemical cells,2015,"['light-emitting electrochemical cells', 'Organic small molecules']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) is regarded to be the potential candidate to replace expensive organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) because LECs have many advantages such as simple device architecture and air stable electrodes. Our previous reports suggest that phenanthroimidazole derivatives can function as an emitter in the light emitting electrochemical cells. However, in that case the synthesized molecule emits in the sky blue region in its solution and yellowish green in the light emitting electrochemical cell. Learning from that, a phenanthroimidazole derivative is designed here to get a short conjugated molecule which is emitting in the deep blue region of the spectrum. Furthermore, the synthetic strategy is extended to obtain an ionic deep blue emitter, which may facilitate the use of this molecule in LEC devices without any additional ions. Since the deep blue emitter for LEC devices are rare to this date, the report on easily accessible deep blue emitter for electrochemical cells could be a significant achievement in the research of LEC devices."

Through reviewing the literature on community development and collaborative governance, this study develops a model of collaborative community governance as an integrative framework with a set of evaluation criteria to examine emerging collaborative community governance practices in Korea. This model is composed of four components?the cyclical process of collaboration (face-to-face dialogue, social learning, trust building, and commitment to the process), institutional design that affects the collaborative process (broad inclusiveness, equality, process transparency, and ground rules), collaborative capacity (intellectual, social and political capitals) as sociopolitical outcome and perceived effectiveness of collaborative governance. This study then evaluates two representative community-building practices in Korea to examine to what extent factors of the institutional design, leadership, educational programs and governance process influence the outcomes. The path analysis verifies the largest effect of deliberation on physical outcome and the largest effect of social learning on governance evaluation. The results also confirm the strongest influence of social learning on intellectual capital, the strongest influence of trust building on social capital, and the strongest influence of deliberation to political capitals. From these results, it is suggested that making efforts to facilitate face-to-face dialogue, deep deliberation, and social learning during the governance process would be the most effective strategy to produce better outcomes."

Nevertheless, both academics and practitioners often find it difficult to engage in successful writing strategies. Indeed, writing is hard work, and doing it in a way that leads to publication is an even harder task. Since reading is essential to good writing, the challenges of learning to write are obvious. In this essay, I am drawing on many years of experience in writing and publishing, as well as considerable reading of writers’ memoirs, advice books on writing, literary studies, and other perspectives on the experience of writing in order to offer a set of approaches that can be pursued over a lifetime of scholarship and practice. Writing is a craft or art to be learned, and learning demands paying attention to the audience, having clear objectives, being an avid reader, and possessing the ability to accept and learn from criticism. While information professionals and scholars incessantly write for each other, there are large segments of the public and other disciplines who they ignore. Fortunately, the tools and resources for improving one’s writing are both broad and deep; discipline and realistic strategies are all that are required to improve one’s writing and, ultimately, to achieve success in publishing."

It is true that many Miltonists like Patricia M. Howison and Regina M. Schwartz have observed the problem of remembrance and forgetfulness as a crucial key to comprehending this epic. They did not, however, devote full attention to the last two Books in this epic, failing to capture the two special conditions in these Books. Thus, this paper analyzes the power of memory with two distinguished features in the final pair: first, Adam and Eve are in the postlapsarian Eden; second, Michael’s prophecy is a ‘biblical’ and ‘oral’ presentation of the Bible story. Above all, the final two Books begin with the Fall, so Adam and Eve have to experience the flow of time. Under this tragic condition, the fallen ancestors learn how to build a new identity, find a new meaning and cultivate new virtue through the exercise of their memory. In the postlapsarian world, memory fulfills a function as a mediator enabling one to see “what he has experienced” and “what the true meaning is in it” and helps one to overcome his desperate condition. It is also significant to see that Michael’s prophecy has ‘improvisational’ feature, which is biblical but not the same as the Bible itself. So, Michael does not teach Adam to remember every detail of the biblical history, but makes him  remember how to face the changeable future. In this oral and nonliteral prophecy, Michael also adopts an important mnemonic devices, “location” and “images” to enhance Adam’s remembrance. This paper proves that memory can be one of the most creative faculties for two postlapsarian ancestors."

It is considered that we have to learn the meanings of each compound verb systematically because the dictionaries have the only 30% of such compound verbs. I could find that Korean-Japanese books such as Japanese grammar and writing, and expressional sentences, using in the courses of study, published in Korea, weren't dealt with the parts of compound verbs compared to text books, published in Japan. According as the result was obtained through questionnaires, Japanese learners don't have many opportunities of learning in the sentence structures and functions of meanings of compound verbs, they have a tendency of compositions in the forms of Independent verb , Modifier+Independent verb and ~て, de rather than the compound verbs. Therefore, I think that it is necessary for the Japanese learners to practice the concisenesses of expressions by using the compound verbs in development of textbooks and sentence compositions to solve the problems. For this reason, it is considered that it is necessary to make excellent sentences for the inexpressible, deeper meanings and neatness of expressions through the education of compound verbs, also that will do much for solving and reducing mistranslation in translating Japanese into Korean."

People who enroll in the interview of selecting international Chinese language teacher and are finally hired as oversea Chinese teaching staff, in recent years, are more diverse, concerning their professional background. The positive effect of this phenomena is the diversity of the knowledge fields, while on the other hand, its negative effect lies in the insufficiency of the language teaching ability and the relatively superficial understanding towards language and culture dissemination of Chinese language as well. In view of this situation, it is necessary to carry on a rational overall program for international Chinese teachers, offering them further education in accordance with their ability. Namely, to add optional courses and carry on different types of training program so as to effectively solve the problems met in the real process of Chinese language teaching and enhance teachers’ professional orientation and career planning awareness. A series of effective measuresshould be taken in many aspects, such as the selection of personnel, training objectives, occupation development and so on. The brief measuresare the following: Firstly, to train teachers who have real international vision, and deep understanding of Chinese language teaching and Chinese culture. To establish a training mode with “行” as the guide, and having “理，知，行” merging and complementing each other. To referentially encourage and guide students and young teachers who major in international Chinese education, Chinese teaching as a foreign language, Chinese and Chinese Culture, English or other foreign languages and Education to enter the area of international teaching Chinese as a foreign language. Secondly, other specialized personnel should also be encouragedto enter this oversea Chinese language teaching and culture dissemination area, such as arts, traditional Chinese medicine, calligraphy, martial arts and so on. Generally，fixedcurriculum system andlarge-classroom teaching methodsare employed in the current training mode for teachers teaching Chinese to speakers of other languages. This approach ignoresthe professional background differences, inevitably lacking inproper classification. The suggestion is that more optional courses should be designed according to different professional backgrounds, different countries which the teachers are going to, different demandsand so on, so as toprovide a more reasonable curriculum and growth pathfor Chinese and foreign young peoplein this field. Then teachers training quality will be effectively promoted, achieving a more long-term career development of teachers."

Second is the style of painting in the early years of the Qing Dynasty. Third is Yangzhou Baguai and fourth is the influence of Zen Buddhism.

Based on these factors impacting the artistic spirit of Nong Jin, his artistic spirit can be classified into three: creative spirit that did not follow trends, expression of the thought on individuality liberation, and spirit serving the nature as a teacher. The most important factor in terms of the artistic expressions made by Nong Jin is eccentric and solemn atmospheres filling his works. While the painter wanted a success when he was young, he only experienced a frustration and gained nothing. As he kept poverty, inhospitality, and injustice that he experienced as a dejected man of letters all to himself, and accumulated desires to work off his dissatisfaction, it was instilled in his painting style that did not follow the trends and custom of the day. That is why works by Nong Jing only have peculiarity, steepness, unfamiliarity, and dullness instead of elegance, wealthiness, and splendors of a bureaucrat man of letters. Flowing from his brush and ink is suffocating and painful bitterness deep into his heart and his turn of expression was a contempt and rebellion against custom that had long been solidified as a habit. That is why a lone spirit of Nong Jin and his rebellious expression were harmoniously matched, filling his works with springy and peculiar flavors at last."

Based on these factors impacting the artistic spirit of Nong Jin, his artistic spirit can be classified into three: creative spirit that did not follow trends, expression of the thought on individuality liberation, and spirit serving the nature as a teacher.The most important factor in terms of the artistic expressions made by Nong Jin is eccentric and solemn atmospheres filling his works. While the painter wanted a success when he was young, he only experienced a frustration and gained nothing. As he kept poverty, inhospitality, and injustice that he experienced as a dejected man of letters all to himself, and accumulated desires to work off his dissatisfaction, it was instilled in his painting style that did not follow the trends and custom of the day. That is why works by Nong Jing only have peculiarity, steepness, unfamiliarity, and dullness instead of elegance, wealthiness, and splendors of a bureaucrat man of letters. Flowing from his brush and ink is suffocating and painful bitterness deep into his heart and his turn of expression was a contempt and rebellion against custom that had long been solidified as a habit. That is why a lone spirit of Nong Jin and his rebellious expression were harmoniously matched, filling his works with springy and peculiar flavors at last."

Especially P2P traffic data poses a great challenge to network systems administrators. Preemptive measures are necessary for network quality of service(QoS) and efficient resource management like blocking suspicious traffic data. Deep packet inspection(DPI) is the most exact way to detect an intrusion but it may pose a private security problem that requires time. We used several machine learning methods to compare the performance in classifying network traffic data accurately over time. The Random Forest method shows an excellent performance in both accuracy and time.

Back in those days, China formed deep relations with their own ideology and culture and depended on Chinese medicine that caused major influence on their lives instead of just treatment behaviors. Accordingly, it is natural to see information about Chinese medicine in documents that were left behind. Yet, there are not many studies which dealt with the awareness of Chinese medicine by medical missionaries, and most were focused on the criticism imposed by medical missionaries regarding Chinese medicine. Thus, there are also claims amongst recent studies which impose how the medical missionaries moved from overlooking and criticizing Chinese medicine to gaining a “sympathetic viewpoint” to a certain degree. Still, when the documents left behind by medical missionaries is observed, there are many aspects which support how the awareness of Chinese medicine in medical missionaries has not changed significantly.  In addition, medical missionaries actively used medicine like traditional Chinese drugs if the treatment effect was well known. Yet, they barely gave any interest to the five elements, which are the basics of traditional Chinese drugs prescription. In other words, medical missionaries only selected elements of Chinese medicine that were helpful to them just like how the Chinese were choosing what they needed from Western knowledge.  The need to understand Chinese medicine was growing according to the flow of times. For instance, some medical missionaries admitted the treatment effect of acupuncture in contrast to claiming it as non-scientific in the past. Such changes were also related to how focused medical missionaries were on medical activities. The first medical missionaries emphasized the non-scientific aspect of Chinese medicine to verify the legitimacy of medical mission. Then, medical missionaries gradually exerted more efforts on medical treatment than direct mission activities so the need of Chinese medicine became greater. This was because Chinese relied on Chinese medicine the most and even used Chinese medicine terms that they knew to explain their conditions while getting treatment from doctors who learned Western medicine. Additionally, medicine missionaries witnessed patients getting better after receiving treatment so they could not completely overlook Chinese medicine.  However, medical missionaries strongly believed in the superiority of Western medicine and considered that China certainly needed Western medicine from a scientific perspective. Chinese doctors who were close to medical missionaries and learned about Western medicine believed in Western medicine and thought that Chinese medicine only held historical value besides some fields like Chinese traditional drugs."

For example,in the past the courses for the 19th century and the 20th century poetry were taught separately, but now those courses are combined into one course as ‘the 19th and20th century poetry.’ This trend seems to have been triggered by the idea that students do not need or want to learn English literature at a deep level. To meet the demands of the students who have been inundated by popular culture, some departments offer the courses like ‘Reading the Best Selling Books’ or ‘PopularLiterature.’ In this current situation, it may sound anachronistic to argue that a course of Victorian literature and culture, which covers only around 70 years and may seem dull, should be taught. However, learning about Victorian literature and culture is essential to understand the modern English and even American culture.And English departments should consider that a large number of the students wantto study the background of the modern Western culture. Nonetheless, few departments offer the course because they failed to interest students with the traditional approach of teaching major novels in the period. To get students interested in this course, diverse literary texts and cultural aspects should be added.Non-canonical texts such as Book of Nonsense by Edward Lear or Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll would intrigue students. And why and how Victorian etiquette developed into the modern forms would also be interesting topics for them. In addition, various Victorian prose will be useful for students’reading comprehension and critical thinking. The movements of Decadence andAestheticism will help students to understand Modernism. This paper introduces a  case study of teaching a Victorian literature and culture course in one of the universities in Seoul."

특권의 울타리 밖으로: 『어둠이 오기 전 여름』에 나타난 여성 주체성과 자유의 문제,2015,"['female subjectivity', 'class', 'gender roles', 'freedom', 'privilege', 'mirror encounter']",국문 초록 정보 없음,"Doris Lessing’s The Summer Before the Dark prefigures the third-wave feminism’s critique of the unitary notion of female subject hood that undermined earlier women’s liberation movements. Centered on Kate Brown’s evolving consciousness, the novel illumines her spiritual journey to the recognition that while she has been sacrificed as an angel-in-the-house, she nevertheless is a beneficiary in the global system of exploitation. Lessing, in the earlier half of the novel, posits the protagonist along the two familiar lines of women’s liberation narratives: career pursuit and sexual autonomy. It becomes clear, though, neither work nor sex will salvage Kate from her deep sense of failure and intense spiritual crisis. Instead, Lessing allows her to experience a series of mirroring encounter; people of diverse social status induce her to reflect on what she really is in a way that opens her eyes to crucial facets of socioeconomic formation and operation, illuminating how they have determined her seemingly unique personality, not to mention of her life devoted to her family. Further, Kate learns to symbolically align herself with the underprivileged through a per formative act of living as an ignored and therefore ‘invisible’ woman owing to unattractive look. Lessing ends this novel without presenting how Kate’s experience may result in significant changes in her life. Nevertheless, in the final act of returning home is embedded a potential of alternative forms of female subjectivity and liberation, rather than a debilitating failure or a gloomy social vision."

Uicheon recommended that, at first, you should learn BuddhāvataṃsakanāmamahāvaipulyaSūtra which explained the thought of Yusim (only-mind), the basis of the thought of Samgyeyusik(三界唯識) to know the ideology of Vijñaptimātratā in Ganjeongseongyusikrondangwaseo(刊定成唯識論單科序), Essence(性) and Form(相) in the thoughts of Vijñaptimātratā and Hwaeom should be studied together like the sun and the moon in the sky, or the heaven and the earth of Juyeok(周易). And also, he suggested that you should study in order of the times and the thoughts the doors of Hīnayāna(小乘), 始敎, 終頓敎 and 圓融, that is, Abhidharmakośa-śāstra, the thought of Vijñaptimātratā, Gishinron(起信論), and the thought of Hwaeom.

In such a point of view, it means that he didn't accept the theory of the ninth consciousness of Paramārtha in Seopronjong(攝論宗) which was formed in 6C, but supported the thought of Vijñaptimātratā in India's Mahāyāna Buddhism, the theory of the eighth consciousness which Hyeonjang, Gyugi of Beopsangjong which was formed in 7C, Woncheuk(圓測) of Seomyeong school(西明學派) insisted. And Uicheon said that Aśvaghoṣa, Nāgārjuna, Asaṅga, Vasubandhu were different from their schools in the divisions of the Essential-nature school, the Śūnyatā school, the Dharma character school, but in the thought of harmony, their bases were same. Also, in the Shinpyeonjejonggyojangchongrok written by Uicheon, it includes the commentary contents of a total, 1,010 chapters, 4,857 books. Among this commentary, the commentary of Vijñaptimātratā has a percentage of 8.21% to the chapters, 13.6% to the books, a total 83 chapters and 661 books. In this commentary, there are no records of commentaries on China's Jironjong(地論宗), Seopronjong, Beopsangjong, and the course of Jironjong in the Seomyeong School. In the Shinpyeonjejonggyojangchongrok, there includes the Gusikjang(九識章) which was written to advocate the theory of the ninth consciousness by Paramārtha of Seopronjong.

King Yeongjo considered that Korean alphabet Hangeul was useful not only to people in general but also to the literati and the royal family members especially in practicing moral culture. That was the main reason why he had a fondness for Korean vernacular poems of dignity. In fact, even before his accession, King Yeongjo was deeply impressed by Eobusa, so he transcribed its text along with those of Dosansibigok and Gwonseonjiroga. Furthermore, because Yeongjo admired Yi Hwang for his personality and learning, he hopefully regarded these three works as having been composed by Yi Hwang. King Yeongjo’s such taste in Korean vernacular poetry was manifested while he rewrote his own work. King Yeongjo wrote a Chinese poem after the model of Gwonseonjiroga at one time before June 1746, and afterward he was informed that Gwonseonjiroga as well as Eobusa and Dosansibigok had been actually composed by Yi Hwang. With deep emotion, he decided to revise his work so as to make it more closely resemble Gwonseonjiroga in expressions. Nonetheless, King Yeongjo’s revised work named ‘Gwonseonjirohaeng’ somewhat differs from Gwonseonjiroga in poetic sentiment although they have almost the same theme that advises people to seek after Confucianism. That is, Gwonseonjiroga compares the pursuit of Confucianism to the process of building ‘Confucian House’ while Gwonseonjirohaeng draws an analogy between studying Confucian teachings and a kind of trip to the place where Confucius and Mencius are seated. After completing the revision, King Yeongjo intented to present Dosanseowon in Andong, the lecture hall in which Yi Hwang had taught his disciples in his later years, with Gwonseonjirohaeng. However, Several subjects resolutely insisted that King Yeongjo cease his scheme because there was no concrete evidence that Yi Hwang actually composed Gwonseonjiroga. King Yeongjo was reluctant to accept their assertion, so his Gwonseonjirohaeng also could not be made public after all."

This study will show two Asian top teams, Korea and Japan, their position in the world instead of Asia, their priority to improve their position, and some implication to catch up top teams. Method: Analyze objective play by play data of each team instead of subjective observation. To analyze technical performance, we will focus on the process of decisive play for attack, such as shot, goal, assist, and defensive play, tackle and clear. We also observe data of position, and area, which played, and time, which should be related tactical trend. Result: Since 2008 to 2013, Spanish team was ranked No.1 in FIFA ranking. Most of teams try to learn Spanish style and imitated their way. Data reflected on Spanish style, which tried to keep a ball as long as possible to initiate game. On the other hand, not strong teams (lower FIFA ranking teams) tended to have different style, which mainly defensive and counterattack style. For FIFA World Cup 2014, many teams adopted different styles to compete previous Champion, Spain. Even Columbia, the highest possession rate in the past 50 years at the World Cup, changed their style to counter attack. Argentina, Brazil, those countries also changed their style. German, new champion, was more flexible in terms of style, and Netherland was flexible to system. Data of Japan showed similar tendency with Spanish team, and Korea was difficult to find specific style by data. Conclusion: From detail data, we can find some characteristics at World top level teams. Even though each team has his own style, data showed that his style logically made sense to win the big competition, FIFA World Cup. Addition to historical background among those strong teams, they all knew their strong points and week points by their considerable and deep analysis with high technology and their expertise. When we analyzed data of Korea for the past 2 World Cup, it was difficult to find specific characteristic. In the case of Japan, we could find similar data with Spain. From those two different cases, we concluded that both Korea and Japan were much behind compared to other World top teams. Those 2 teams are not enough to consider to improve their performance by monitoring data and those analysis. Same as all business entities, without PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) cycle, or performance improvement process, it might be difficult to follow World top teams, Korea and Japan team need to focus more on analytical efforts."

In the Korean curriculum for ‘vocabulary’, the content elements are established for Korean education before actually proceeding with the education. A lot of researches on vocabulary education have concluded that the goal of vocabulary education is to increase vocabulary; however, in the Korean curriculum for vocabulary education, it is necessary to suggest a more legitimate method of teaching for vocabulary (Korean) education for the speakers using it as mother language, not for second language education where the instrumental perspective is dominant. Regarding the contents of vocabulary education in the Korean curriculum, the researcher basically examined the achievement standards of the common curriculum and the selective curriculum (Korean Ⅰ, Ⅱ,Reading and Grammar). As a result, in the common curriculum, there exists hierarchy in the achievement standards by grades, which means that it suggests the process of change from the instrumental to cognitive perspective though it is not deep enough. And about the selective curriculum (KoreanⅠ,Ⅱ), the study has found that the contents of vocabulary education are not properly reflected according to the characteristics of organization of KoreanⅠ and Ⅱ. In order to realize more enriched vocabulary education, it will be needed to expand the elements of vocabulary in the curriculum and also provide detailed as well as aggressive support and research through such things as vocabulary teaching ㆍ learning manuals."

One of the many controversial questions was: “Was it possible or even thinkable to do Arts freely in the totalitarian country such as East Germany?” It is important to remark that this “Dispute of Pictures”, which has been rightly described as a “Proxy war” (Stellvertreterkrieg) did not represent the conventional image of two antagonistic parties in conflict as it has been often assumed. Rather, it showed the subtle differences between diverse positions and perspectives, expressed beyond the dichotomy of the invisible Wall between the East and the West.

Retracing his concept and ideas on the constitutional law can give us an understanding on constitutional research and the constitution itself at that time. He was actually the only scholar who dedicated himself to study the U.S. Constitution and his dedication resulted in various publications in this field. He also established The Association of the American Constitution, which is an important infrastructure that helps research on the U.S. Constitution significantly. Professor Moon Hong-ju concentrated on subjects such as unique understanding on legal status of the people and suggesting terminologies concerning the fundamental rights. He also focused on policy assessment as well as interpretation of parliamentary inspection, parliamentary committees and impeachment based on the systematic understanding of the presidential and cabinet government. While holding a public office, he participated in amending the Constitution. On the one hand, such experience led him to have interest in and contemplate about desirable constitution. On the other hand, however, the experience hindered him from keeping some distance from politics in the real world and assessing the constitutional politics and constitutional law from neutral point of view. Therefore, his understanding on the political structure of the constitution of 1972 and democracy envisaged in the Constitution of 1980 is to be scrutinized. There was a certain generational limit in understanding and designing the constitution and the constitutional politics among pioneer scholars, due to their birth in the colonial period, the Korean War experience, and deep frustration over the cabinet system of the Constitution of 1960; Professor Moon Hong-ju was not exceptional. Besides the generational limit, there was limit also in how to approach to constitutional study, which remained in the issue of the constitutional norm and lacked further macro analysis concerning the interconnection between the general task and the structure of the Constitution. To establish the history of the constitutional theory, the first step we should take would be to comprehend and learn lessons from his understandings and ideas while accepting generational and methodological limit."

Shimjae lived through the turmoil periods that cover Chosun, which was perished by the Japanese Occupation and later liberated from the Japan``s rule. As growing up on Jeju Island, he learnt from his grandfather; and afterwards maintained learning from Yee Yong-Ho who exiled to the island. Further he sought learning from Boohae Ahn Byoung-Taek by visiting him in Kwangju. Shimjae later on succeeded the academic linkages that include Nosa Khee Jeong-Jin, Songsa Ki Woo-Man, and Boohae Ahn Byoung-Taek. Shimjae``s life got to change after the uprising movement in Jeju Island that took place in the year 1909. Shimjae was involved deeply in the uprising movement after the event of delivering the urgent notices drafted by Ki Woo-Man. Also, the fact that his brother was at the center of the uprising movement motivated him to get involved in the movement. After the uprising movement went into vain, Shimjae exerted great efforts on writing works. The works of Shimjae are mostly the kinds of handwriting manuscripts except for collected anthologies and sole-authored books. His works concern documenting the artefacts of the Chosun period and diverse facets of Jeju Island. We can conclude that Shimjae``s works reflect his failed consciousness that came from Chosun dynasty having died out by the occupation of Japan and his deep interest in Jeju Island. His failed consciousness of perished Chosun was sparked by the failure of the uprising movement. With bearing the nostalgic, failed consciousness of perished Chosun, he traced back to the memories of the prosperities of Chosun. His works concerning Jeju Island are meaningful in that they cherish the wholehearted feelings towards the island as transforming previous viewpoints. However, his works except for certain sentences are limited to the Chosun period, which can be considered as limitations of his works."

Once the Word penetrates deep into the heart of humanity, it changes the life of humanity, having influence over the world. Our human languages have an influence on our modus vivendi and way of thought, leading to the establishment of cultural communities. Therefore, we can say that a language has a twofold characteristic. The source of a sophisticated culture and the fruit of culture. In this regard, the Catholic Church has showed great interest in the ‘seeds of the Gospel’ present in diverse national cultures, trying to approach the languages of non-Christian nations as a way to promote intimacy with them.  In this paper the author discusses indigenous languages as one of the important problems in the history of Catholic missionary activity, contemplating the examples of some missionaries. Especially, the author places the focus on two questions. What kind of attitude did the missionaries assume towards indigenous languages? What kind of effort did the missionaries make to learn the indigenous languages? In this regard, the author looks at the method of the Byzantine Greek brothers Sts. Cyrillus and Methodius, who had to live as heroic missionaries among the Slavic people all through their lives, paying great attention to the indigenous language as the creator of the Slavic alphabets. Then the focus will be brought into the foreign missionary activity of Raymond of Penafort and the members of the Dominican Order. They were eminent with their linguistical works in their ‘journey ad gentes’ of the monks in the Middle Age. Special attention will be given to the Studia linguarum as a method for understanding the culture of the missionary regions. Lastly, the author will make a comment on the Clavis Sinica, i.e. a key to understand the Chinese language, as a means for the Jesuits to overcome their problem with Chinese language. At the same time, the insertion of Clavis Sinica into Christian missionary literature as well as the birth of the ‘Chinese Grammar’ will be examined.  With this paper the author looks into the difficulties of the missionaries about the indigenous languages in their history of missionary activity, and insights into the methodologies of today’s missionary activity as it ought to be. Due to modern society where our contemporaries still have the problem of communication, the Church must continue face the challenge of her basic mission to proclaim the ‘Word.’"

This study classifies those books into information and history books according to the characteristics, and provides a brief review of writers` personal backgrounds, purpose of writing and contents of description. On the basis of the policy of conquering Joseon by military force(征韓論) shortly after the Restoration of Meiji, a number of relatively small-volume information books were written by scholars of the Chinese classics to introduce various information, including geography, history, institutions and customs of Joseon, and published. Before and after the Sino-Japanese War, large-volume history books written in modern style by college graduates with modern educational backgrounds appeared with information books affected by them. Such a change was caused by the need for much information about and deep understanding of Joseon as modern education system was established in Japan and Japanese colonial rule over Joseon became clear. During this period, books were written based on the thought of the kokugaku (國學派: national learning) school in the Edo period, in which the conquest of Silla and the foundation of Mimana Nihonfu by Empress Jingu were described as true. In the meantime, the descriptions which were grounded on the theory of Japan and Joseon sharing the same ancestry(日鮮同祖論) showed a subtle distinction between information books inheriting the kokugaku tradition and history books affected by modern historical science. Both are books related to Korean history, however, they have the common points that they never referred to new historical understandings and findings in which Dangun and Balhae had been highlighted since the late Joseon period."

The Sequel of the Great Code(續大典) helps for the work, in so far as it enacts some important points of the examinations. This study can extract three ideal types of the examinations from the Code. These are education type, management type and selection type. The characters are as follows.  First, the education type contains ‘Tongdok(通讀)’ and ‘Sengbo(陞補)’. The two examinations have educational function as the curriculum in common. Because they are implemented monthly in order, and the records are summed up annually.  Second, the management type contains ‘Hanbje(合製)’ and ‘Gongdohoe(公都會)’. The two examinations are identical in process of the test. And the aim of the test is the enlargement of the opportunity for the student to enter himself for the examination, and so the management of the learning of them. The students could control their schedule of learning by the tests.  Third, selection type contains ‘Jeongang(殿講)’, ‘Jeolilje(節日製)’ and ‘Hwanggamje(黃柑製)’. These are identical to the civil service examination in fact. Because the winners of the examinations were considered as the successful candidates of the civil service exam.  These results shows the divirsity of the national encouragement examinations. But the types are ideal and formal because they are extracted from the law book. So they must be reconsidered through looking deep into historical evidences."

When this area couldn't be protected safely, Korean history was history of tragedy. Innovation of thought is a necessary thing for this area with such historical pain to be transformed into a worldwide tourist town.　Thus it's necessary to make Ansan　and Ansan neighboring seas at a site of living history education for world peace and the world which has no aggressive war. The water depth is deep and is the place where the natural view is also beautiful and I also have history, so these areas are the worldwide ocean universe Airlines leisure town and the most suitable place to make a world peace park. It makes the sense as the first train paper of the China-Japanese war which tells modernization for Japanese, so this area is the place many Japanese would like to try on.

미래 교사교육에서의 교육심리학의 역할,2015,"['교사교육', '교사전문성', '교육심리학', '윤리민감성', '인간발달', 'educational psychology', 'ethical sensitivity', 'human development', 'teacher education', 'teacher expertise']","이 연구의 목적은 미래의 교사교육에서 교육심리학의 역할을 탐색하는 것이다. 연구의 목적을 달성하기위해 살펴본 구체적인 연구 내용은 크게 세 부분이다. 첫째, 교사교육에서 교육심리학의 탐구영역을 인간발달분야와 교사전문성 분야로 구분하여 제시하였다. 인간발달분야는 기존의 교수, 학습과 관련된 탐구영역 이외에 교육심리학자들이 교사교육과 관련하여 좀 더 관심을 기울여야 할 영역이다. 교사전문성 중에서 교사의 윤리민감성은 교육심리학자들이 미래 교육현장에서 부딪힐 수 있는 다양한 유형의 갈등을 해결하는 데 도움을 줄 수 있는 연구 영역이다. 둘째, 교사교육에서 교육심리학을 효과적으로 가르치는 것과관련하여, 교실에서의 교사의 역할과 교육심리학 수업의 효과성을 살펴보았다. 앞으로의 교육 현장은 학교와 교실의 물리적 환경뿐만 아니라 학생들의 집단역동의 기반이 되는 인적 구성이 보다 이질적으로 변해 갈 것으로 예상된다. 지금보다 훨씬 복잡해질 교육현실을 고려해볼 때, 교사에게는 예비교사 양성단계에서 접한 지식을 실제 교직생활을 하면서 자기 나름대로의 이론적 틀에 비추어 적용하는 능력이 필요하다. 즉교사는 교실에서 발달연구자로서의 역할을 수행할 필요가 있다. 또한 교육심리학 수업의 효과성을 확인하기 위해서 교육심리학을 현재 배우고 있는 학생들을 대상으로 수업의 효과성을 탐색하고, 졸업 후 교사가된 학생들에게 교육심리학이 어떠한 방식으로 도움을 주고 있는지를 확인할 필요가 있다. 셋째, 교사교육에서 교육심리학의 현장 적용성의 필요성을 살펴보았다. 결론적으로 변화하는 교육환경에서 교사는 교과와 교육학에 대한 깊이 있고 정확한 지식뿐만 아니라 인간과 세상에 대한 편견 없는 태도, 높은 윤리적수준, 반성적 사고자로서 자신의 교육을 끊임없이 성찰하려고 노력하는 자세를 갖출 필요가 있다. 미래 교육에 필요한 이러한 교사를 양성하기 위해 교육심리학자들은 현장 적용성을 고려한 연구와 교육의 측면에서 보다 적극적으로 자신의 역할을 담당해야 할 것이다.","The purpose of this study was to explore the role of educational psychology for the future of teacher education. The research content consists of three parts to achieve a research purpose. First, this paper addresses two research areas of educational psychology in teacher education: human development and teacher expertise. Educational psychologist should be more interested in human development which is the one of important research areas, but has been relatively neglected compared to teaching-learning area. Teachers’ ethical sensitivity as teacher expertise is the research area that educational psychologist can give teachers suggestions to resolve various conflicts which may occur in educational settings. Second, withrespect to teaching effectively educational psychology, this research explored teachers’ role and the effectiveness of educational psychology course in teacher education. In the future, educational settings will be changed into more heterogeneous environment, including physical school environment and class composition related to group dynamics. Considering more complex educational settings in the future, teachers need to apply pedagogical knowledge based on their own theoretical frames to real teaching situation: teachers should play a role as a development researcher in the classroom. Furthermore, in order to identify the effectiveness of educational psychology course, the effectiveness of educational psychology for pre-service teachers and the degree of help of educational psychology for in-service teachers should be explored. Lastly, the necessity of the field application of educational psychology was discussed in teacher education. To conclude, in the changing educational settings, teachers need to be unbiased with high ethical level. They also need to make constant efforts to become a reflective thinker as well as having deep and accurate knowledge of subjects and pedagogy. In order to train teachers for the future, it is important that educational psychologists take an active role as educators and researchers who consider field application."

Integrity of the European Union began in the Middle Ages, and May 5, 1949 the European Council had the modern sense by agreeing to form the first pan-European single institution. Since 1993, the European Union was established by the Maastricht Treaty, Croatia has recently become the 28th member of the European Union and was enlarged. After the organization of the European Union, the maintenance of private-law and the formation of the single market in the European Union were the continuous task of the European Union.In the private law sector, the European Contract Law establishing movement was begun by related jurists in the European Union. In addition to European contract law, the development of certain contract law sector such as the European Insurance Contract Law has already nearly 20 years research has been conducted. The official team created the framework of European Insurance Contract Law common provisions for the General rules section at the end of 2007 and it was submitted to the European Union. Also the particulars area was completed. The unifications of the European private law, particularly in the research work for the unification of insurance contract law would be a material that can be understood by a variety of cross-section of the judicial development of the future Europe. And it also makes sense to find the development direction of the direct and indirect methods to Korean law.The PEICL contains 6 Parts and 18 Chapters. It includes the general provisions that deal with almost all sectors of insurance, such as the fixed return insurance and indemnity insurance, except for the re-insurance. In particular, the PEICL deals with the specific insurances, also liability insurance, life insurance and group insurance, in which an insurer takes a quite substantial risk, such as the maritime or aviation insurance sector.The European scholars’ research and efforts for harmonization of European insurance contract law will be the great models to the Korean scholars when they discuss the amendment to the Korean insurance act, particularly on the point of insurace-consumer contract. Furthermore, it can be the important guidepost for designing a harmonized form of insurance law of two Koreas in the future after unification. Therefore, it will be worthy learning from the comments by the leading European scholars.Under the this writing, it will be just dealt with differency or special points between the Korean insurance act and PEICL from the perspectives of insurance-consumer contract. The detailed issues of PEICL will be studied deep into subject later."

Other than ShiHua(詩話), Joseon(朝鮮) Dynasty writers’ views on poetry and prose can be observed also from letters, prefaces or epilogues. In particular, this paper focuses on 18th-19th ShiHua(詩話) writers and their letters in order to examine discussions on poetics among literary men of Joseon(朝鮮) who were interested in poetry criticism.In the letters by poet-critics during the 18th and 19th centuries, discussions on poetry can be divided into two types. One type of discussion is on methods for studying poet[學詩法], while the other type of discussion is on methods for writing poet[作詩法]. Topics of the letters during the 18th century were focused on covering all different periods of Tang(唐) including ChuTang(初唐), ShengTang(盛唐), ZhongTang(中唐), WanTang(晩唐) and resisting fancy, emotional expressions. However, topics of the letters during the 19th century were focused on particular topics such as ‘step by step learning from Cheng(淸) poet to become a Tang(唐) poet’ and ‘deep thinking on poetic words and verses.’ Through these changes in topics in different periods, the current paper recognizes that discussions on poetry in the 19th century covered more various areas and were more sophisticated than those in the 18th century."
