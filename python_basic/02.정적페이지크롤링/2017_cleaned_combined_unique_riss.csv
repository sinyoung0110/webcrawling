Inverse reinforcement learning control for trajectory tracking of a multirotor UAV,2017,,,"PThe main purpose of this paper is to learn the control performance of an expert by imitating the demonstrations of a multirotor UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operated by an expert pilot. First, we collect a set of several demonstrations by an expert for a certain task which we want to learn. We extract a representative trajectory from the datdset. Here, the representative trajectory includes a sequence of state and input. The trajectory is obtained using hidden Markov model (HMM) and dynamic time warping (DTW). In the next step, the multirotor learns to track the trajectory for imitation. Although we have data of feed-forward input for each time sequence, using this input diiectly can deteriorate the stability of the multirotor due to insufficient data for generalization and numerical issues., For that reason, a controller is needed which generates the input command for the suitable flight maneuver. To design such a controller, we learn the hidden reward function of a quadratic form from the demonstrated flights using inverse reinforcement learning. After we find the optimal reward function that minimizes the trajectory tracking error, we design a reinforcement learning based controller using this reward function. The simulation and experiment applied to a multirotor UAV show successful imitation results.P",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Collision Prediction based Genetic Network Programming-Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Robot Navigation in Unknown Dynamic Environments,2017,"['Collision prediction', 'Genetic NETWORK PROGRAMMING with Reinforcement Learning (GNP-RL)', 'Mobile robot navigation', 'Unknown dynamic environment']",,"The problem of determining a smooth and collision-free path with maximum possible speed for a Mobile Robot (MR) which is chasing a moving target in a dynamic environment is addressed in this paper. Genetic Network Programming with Reinforcement Learning (GNP-RL) has several important features over other evolutionary algorithms such as it combines offline and online learning on the one hand, and it combines diversified and intensified search on the other hand, but it was used in solving the problem of MR navigation in static environment only. This paper presents GNP-RL based on predicting collision positions as a first attempt to apply it for MR navigation in dynamic environment. The combination between features of the proposed collision prediction and that of GNP-RL provides safe navigation (effective obstacle avoidance) in dynamic environment, smooth movement, and reducing the obstacle avoidance latency time. Simulation in dynamic environment is used to evaluate the performance of collision prediction based GNP-RL compared with that of two state-of-the art navigation approaches, namely, Q-Learning (QL) and Artificial Potential Field (APF). The simulation results show that the proposed GNP-RL outperforms both QL and APF in terms of smooth movement and safer navigation. In addition, it outperforms APF in terms of preserving maximum possible speed during obstacle avoidance.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Access Management in Wireless Cellular Networks,2017,,,"PIn smart city applications, huge numbers of devices need to be connected in an autonomous manner. 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifies that Machine Type Communication (MTC) should be used to handle data transmission among a large number of devices. However, the data transmission rates are highly variable, and this brings about a congestion problem. To tackle this problem, the use of Access Class Barring (ACB) is recommended to restrict the number of access attempts allowed in data transmission by utilizing strategic parameters. In this paper, we model the problem of determining the strategic parameters with a reinforcement learning algorithm. In our model, the system evolves to minimize both the collision rate and the access delay. The experimental results show that our scheme improves system performance in terms of the access success rate, the failure rate, the collision rate, and the access delay.P",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Neurodevelopmental Changes in Social Reinforcement Processing A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study,2017,"['Functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'Social reward', 'Ventro-medial prefrontal cortex', 'Amygdala', 'Anterior insula', 'Context-dependent psychophysiological interaction.']",,"Objective In the current study we investigated neurodevelopmental changes in response to social and non-social reinforcement. Methods Fifty-three healthy participants including 16 early adolescents (age, 10-15 years), 16 late adolescents (age, 15-18 years), and 21 young adults (age, 21-25 years) completed a socialnon-social reward learning task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants responded to fractal image stimuli and received social or non-social rewardnon-rewards according to their accuracy. ANOVAs were conducted on both the blood oxygen level dependent response data and the product of a context-dependent psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis involving ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and bilateral insula cortices as seed regions. Results Early adolescents showed significantly increased activation in the amygdala and anterior insula cortex in response to non-social monetary rewards relative to both social rewardnon-reward and monetary non-rewards compared to late adolescents and young adults. In addition, early adolescents showed significantly more positive connectivity between the vmPFCbilateral insula cortices seeds and other regions implicated in reinforcement processing (the amygdala, posterior cingulate cortex, insula cortex, and lentiform nucleus) in response to non-reward and especially social non-reward, compared to late adolescents and young adults. Conclusion It appears that early adolescence may be marked by (i) a selective increase in responsiveness to non-social, relative to social, rewards and (ii) enhanced, integrated functioning of reinforcement circuitry for non-reward, and in particular, with respect to posterior cingulate and insula cortices, for social non-reward.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Integral Temporal Difference Learning for Continuous-Time Linear Quadratic Regulations,2017,"['Adaptive optimal control', 'linear quadratic regulation', 'reinforcement learning', 'temporal difference', 'value iteration']",,"In this paper, we propose a temporal difference (TD) learning method, called integral TD learning thatefficiently finds solutions to continuous-time (CT) linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in an online fashionwhere system matrix A is unknown. The idea originates from a computational reinforcement learning methodknown as TD(0), which is the simplest TD method in a finite Markov decision process. For the proposed integral TDmethod, we mathematically analyze the positive definiteness of the updated value functions, monotone convergenceconditions, and stability properties concerning the locations of the closed-loop poles in terms of the learning rateand the discount factor. The proposed method includes the existing value iteration method for CT LQR problemsas a special case. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodand further investigate the aforementioned mathematical properties.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Cyclic Error Correction based Q-learning for Mobile Robots Navigation,2017,"['Cyclic step-size', 'ensemble wisdom', 'mobile robots navigation', 'reinforcement learning']",,"Similar to control systems, reinforcement learning can capture notions of optimal behavior using naturalinteraction experience. In the context of reinforcement learning, the temporal difference error of the generatedexperience measures how well the learner responds to the system.

The proposed cyclic step-sizecould better control how new estimates are iteratively blended together over time, and the new estimates guide theaction selection process which in turn influence the value distribution. To guide more promising action decision, anensemble action selector is proposed which incorporates the idea of ensemble wisdom of the weak.

Robust Visual Tracking Using Structure-Preserving Sparse Learning,2017,,,"PEven though numerous visual tracking methods have been proposed to deal with image streams, it is a still challenging problem to facilitate a tracking method to accurately distinguish the target from the background without drifting under the severe appearance variation of target caused by distortion of local structures. For preserving local structures of target template datasets, we present a novel structure-preserving sparse learning algorithm by obtaining sparse coefficients under maximum margin projection-based subspace representation and by updating the sparse codes under multiple task feature selection framework. To reinforce local structures of targets, we adopted a novel optimization process using an accelerated proximal gradient shrinkage operation and an efficient stopping criterion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art tracking methods.P",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Structural failure classification for reinforced concrete buildings using trained neural network based multi-objective genetic algorithm,2017,"['genetic algorithm', 'classification', 'neural network', 'reinforced concrete']",,"Structural design has an imperative role in deciding the failure possibility of a Reinforced Concrete (RC) structure. Recent research works achieved the goal of predicting the structural failure of the RC structure with the assistance of machine learning techniques. Previously, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been trained supported by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to classify RC structures with reasonable accuracy. Though, keeping in mind the sensitivity in predicting the structural failure, more accurate models are still absent in the context of Machine Learning. Since the efficiency of multiobjective optimization over single objective optimization techniques is well established. Thus, the motivation of the current work is to employ a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to train the Neural Network (NN) based model. In the present work, the NN has been trained with MOGA to minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Maximum Error (ME) toward optimizing the weight vector of the NN. The model has been tested by using a dataset consisting of 150 RC structure buildings. The proposed NN-MOGA based model has been compared with Multi-layer perceptron-feed-forward network (MLPFFN) and NN-PSO based models in terms of several performance metrics. Experimental results suggested that the NN-MOGA has outperformed other existing well known classifiers with a reasonable improvement over them. Meanwhile, the proposed NN-MOGA achieved the superior accuracy of 93.33 and F-measure of 94.44, which is superior to the other classifiers in the present study.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Our goal was to determine if the brain responds differently to motivational events depending on whether they provide feedback with the contingencies effective for learning. Event-related fMRI data were obtained from 22 volunteers performing a visuomotor categorical task. In learning-condition trials, participants learned by trial and error to make left or right responses to letter cues (16 consonants). Monetary rewards (500) or penalties (-500) were given as feedback (learning feedback). In random-condition trials, cues (4 vowels) appeared right or left of the display center, and participants were instructed to respond with the appropriate hand. However, rewards or penalties (random feedback) were given randomly (5050) regardless of the correctness of response. Feedback-associated BOLD responses were analyzed with ANOVA trial type (learning vs. random) x feedback type (reward vs. penalty) using SPM8 (voxel-wise FWE p  .001). The right caudate nucleus and right cerebellum showed activation, whereas the left parahippocampus and other regions as the default mode network showed deactivation, both greater for learning trials than random trials. Activations associated with reward feedback did not differ between the two trial types for any brain region. For penalty, both learning-penalty and random-penalty enhanced activity in the left insular cortex, but not the right. The left insula, however, as well as the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortexdorsal anterior cingulate cortex, showed much greater responses for learning-penalty than for random-penalty. These findings suggest that learning-penalty plays a critical role in learning, unlike rewards or random-penalty, probably not only due to its evoking of aversive emotional responses, but also because of error-detection processing, either of which might lead to changes in planning or strategy.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

In all studies, ranging from 2 to 15 lessons, teachinglearning plans were implemented and evaluated in the class of the researcher while some were applied in other schools, too. The theme of the teachinglearning plans varied but were concentrated on one out of two content elements and two out of six learning elements. The 2007 revised curriculum seems to be an important turning point, not only reinforcing the analyses of the curricular and textbooks in the analyzing stage but also facilitating the use of various methods for the lessons in the developing stage. Practical problem based model was the most frequently adopted, while cooperative learning and ICT served as fundamental although not always mentioned. Various teaching resources such as UCC, reading materials, PPT were developed for the teacher. Activity sheets were the most frequently used for the students, followed by reading materials. Because teachinglearning is an essential core of education, teachinglearning studies should be more actively conducted and the variety of subject topics, methods and resources should also be obtained by more researchers.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

To attain the objective, this study reviewed the precedent literature and found out the problems to tackle. The findings are as follows.1. It turned out that the learners are in high demand of video teaching materials, and particularly interested in Japans culture and society. Also, it was confirmed that video teaching materials significantly contribute to motivating and improving Japanese language learning.2. Using the commercial video material that is effective for the education of learning culture and language learning saves the difficulty of making a video material and its educational effectiveness is also high.3. It has been often pointed out that the effectiveness of existing video teaching materials does not reach beyond simple watching and understanding, so they do not much help the use of Japanese language. However, the results of the surveys with the learners participating in a class using video teaching materials show a great improvement in their speaking ability above all, as well as in writing and listening. This can be explained by the reinforced class design mixing the activity-based conversational Japanese learning with video materials with a role play, which is effective for improving conversational Japanese.4. The Japanese classes using video teaching materials show the learners deepened understanding of Japanese language behaviors. In the cases where it is difficult to explain language behaviors in demand, request, and respect in text, as well as normal greeting manners based on Japanese culture, video teaching materials explain them easily, which leads to high effectiveness of Japanese.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

For this reason, to investigate this period s study structure clearly, this thesis researched the position of literature and suggestion on study of Kim Ahn-ro() as a representative of early16th century s bureaucrat writers.With his educational background, Kim Ahn-ro insisted a study emphasizing both inner development and literature(). But his theory was resisted by the new scholar s opinion that put more value on moral philosophy(). In awareness of crisis about possibility to lose his academic status, Kim Ahn-ro put stress on literature powerfully byemphasizing literature s practical utility.In this point of view, he suggested recovery of a principle of honoring writers and reinforcement of a national school. Although his effort was failed because of the new academic trend s power, it shows Kim Ahn-ro s target consciousness to succeed traditional values of Seongjong period() and his firm bureaucratic position as a leader of politics and literary world.In conclusion, Kim Ahn-ro was a core bureaucrat writer who pursued both inner development and literature with a steady view of learning. These aspects show that there were complex elements like educational background,learning logic and reality conditions make this period explain hard, in spite of the vivid opposition between the school of literature() and moral philosophy().

This is because, by applying the process-oriented approach, students are able to refer back to their initial understanding of the literature, rearrange their knowledge, and develop a critical perspective on the matter, even from the preliminary stage of academic reading. Why this approach is so necessary is because many students suffer from the problem of misreading and thereby fail to understand correctly the meaning behind the academic literature that they are reading. An additional reason why book review writing is an effective method of learning and thereby helps develop transferability of academic writing is because it provides an opportunity for students to read many different kinds of literature and form critical views on the subject matter.A second positive effect of writing book reviews is that students are able to nurture their creative ideas and thereon form authorship in the process. This is a direct result of the students being able to subject their ideas to the scrutiny of their fellow peers and allowing their ideas to enter a process of adjustment and modification, and this process begins from when they start reading and extends itself all the way until they are done editing what they wrote. The objective of this research is to support the claim that a process-oriented methodology that focuses on the way that meaning is formed through social interaction is effective in developing transferability and authorship in regard to book review writing. The process-oriented approach represents a way of learning that takes into account the recursive, interactive, and parallel features of writing and thereby incorporates diverse activities as well as different aspects of interpersonal communication in order to reinforce the formation of meaning in a socially interactive setting. The way that this methodology can be applied in practice is through the activation of the various aspects of learning (reading, writing, deliberation, feedback, self-correction, and editing) at its various stages.Multidimensional feedback that students receive helps supplement the way that students can become complacent to result-oriented textual learning and reinforces what is commonly considered the Achilles heel of process-oriented approach. It is by applying the process-oriented approach that students learn to understand and comprehend the text on their own and to subsequently test that knowledge against the critique of their fellow students. Moreover, additional knowledge about various genres and their characteristics can be acquired through guidance given by lecturers having observed that sufficient deliberation has occurred among the students.In sum, the significance of this research is derived from its proposition that the process-oriented approach, as an effective method of learning book review writing at the university-level, can be used as an alternative to methods that focus on genre and form in academic writing.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Thus, this study comparedanalyzed the educational demands and perception of competencies of corporate field teachers, targeting personnels in charge of school and company.The competencies of corporate field teachers could be viewed through five areas such as perception of apprenticeship education, establishment of apprenticeship education plan, practice of apprenticeship education, evaluation of apprenticeship education, and cooperation with vocational education institutes. In order to examine the educational demands and perception between operating subjects of apprenticeship education for each competency of corporate field teachers, this study used Independent Sampling t-Test, Borich Needs Analysis, and Locus for Focus Model through SPSS. In the results, regardless of operating subjects like school personnels and corporate personnels, the current level of competencies of corporate field teachers was lower than the importance, which shows the high demand for the education for the improvement of competencies of corporate field teachers. Especially, in the results of analyzing the educational demands in each competency of corporate field teachers, the demands of school personnels and corporate personnels were very similar. In other words, both school personnels and corporate personnels showed high perception of apprenticeship education and high educational demands for cooperation of relevant vocational education institutes. In case of corporate personnels, they showed relatively higher educational demands for evaluation of apprenticeship education compared to school personnels.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

It befriended Tamra aborigines and elevated Tamras own status while sending more powerful prefects to the island and increasing economic trades with the people of Tamra. As a result of such increased interactions, in the 13th century Tamra finally became one of the Goryeo Mok units, highly influential local centers of the Goryeo dynasty, and an integral part of the Goryeo society in general.But that time also witnessed the Mongol troops invasion of the Korean peninsula. At first, Tamra seems to have been spared from the war. But after a truce was established between Goryeo and the Mongols in 1259, the plight of the Tamra people began. The renegade Sambyeolcho forces, guards of the Military rulers, briefly took control of the region, severely disrupting the peoples original way of life(till 1273), and then the Mongol empire absorbed the Tamra region, by placing Darugachi monitors on the ground the same year. At first the empire used it as a forward base for its Japanese campaign(in 1274 and 1280), then decided to utilize the region as a trade base, as we can see from the imperial governments efforts to connect the island with several regions on the Goryeo mainland, while not only extracting materials that were being circulated in the Tamra realm, but also eliminating elements that might disturb such imperial policy from the Tamra region.In response, the Goryeo government, which at least in the beginning phase of the Mongol intervention had no other means to stop such policy, only tried to prevent further outflow of resources and workforce from Tamra. Then suddenly, the Yuan imperial government decided to return the Tamra region to Goryeo in 1294, because Tamras value as a transport base was somewhat diminishing while rice transports between the Chinese Jiangnan and Laioyang regions were decreasing as well. Rather pleased at this turn of events, the Goryeo government, trying to make such arrangement permanent while appeasing its imperial counterpart, began to actively submit Tamra-produced materials to the Yuan court to satiate its needs. This actually turned out to be a fatal mistake, as the Mongol dignitaries who came to newly learn the value of Tamra products started to exact more administrative methods to extract Tamra materials in the longer run. Yuan established a Chonggwan-bu office on Goryeo, but at Goryeos strong objection, it instead placed a Manho-bu unit in 1301.Coming into the 14th century, the Goryeo government resumed its policy over Tamra, in ways that were very much different from earlier times. King Chungseon-wang(1298, 1308-1313), consulting methods earlier employed by the Mongol authorities, concentrated upon strengthening ties between the Tamra island and specific regions in the Southern coastline of the Korean peninsula (by newly designating three regions in the vicinity of Naju which was one of the original 8 Mok units at the time as New Mok units, and also reactivating the Seungnaju-do traffic route), and increasing protection of economic entities operating in the Tamra area, no matter they were either Goryeo or Mongol in origin (as we can see from Chungseon-wangs intervention in an incident in which Mongol hunter households in Tamra were stripped and harassed by Goryeo Tamra prefects).Then in the mid-14th century, when King Gongmin-wang was in throne, reflecting his own aspiration to increase the Goryeo governments voice in Tamra-related issues and matters, he first dispatched Sunmun-sa figures to eliminate the Gi family members in Tamra, and then used his own vassals and Tamra prefects to gain control of the Horse ranches and horse-breeding installations in Tamra, from the Mongol households who remained loyal to the already significantly weakened Yuan empire.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

It is necessary for Christian universities to find a way to cope with the restructuring programs strongly driven by the government, and strengthen their educational competitiveness relative to secular institutions. Christian personality education can form a core part of a distinctive and excellent Christian education, which should foster spirituality incarnating the kingdom of God. Personality education in a Christian university aims at a holistic, integrated education, not restricted to cognitive learning but leading to a comprehensive learning and knowing, sharing, and practicing the values of the Gospel while cultivating religious personality and moral character. The success of personality education relies upon the best use of Christian liberal arts courses and efficient educational systems. In this sense, Christian liberal education needs to reconceptualize its contents and direction, and recognize the significance of a humanities education on the basis of the Christian value system.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

In this paper, I searched the love discourse of the magazine to learn how love, marriage and sexuality of Korean woman were discussed and regulated under the trend of Korean development nationalism in the 1960s and how the womans stance was reflected in the modernization system of the period.In the early 1960s, the generation of 4.19 asserted freedom of love out of the belief on the theoretical concept of the self and freedom, which the generation learned as a favorable ideal of democracy though they could not have experienced the ideal within their environment. However, as the military regime reinforced, young generations assertion was retreated, and Yeowon started to emphasize on the role of a homemaker based on a patriarchal family system, so that the modernization of love and marriage was integrated into the nations development plan by renaming the virtue of traditional morality as womans intrinsic value. On the other hand, as the concept of yeonae(love) was generalized and the experience of love was accumulating, there arisen a scepticism on the idea of sublime and lasting love. With this scepticism, the divorce rate was increased, and the free-wifes discourse was seething fiercely. The discourse on free-wives(Chayu-buin) of the 1960s was different from that of the 1950s, in that it was generated with the tendency for some women to determine to reject the gender role given to a woman within the trend of capitalism which revealed outspoken affirmation on the desire for sex and material. In the background of the free-wifes discourse, thoughts and experiences that deviated from the integrated authority of the discourse traveled across intricately, while the violent nature of mans patriarchism and the expedient nature of womans opportunism riding on the very patriarchism were revealed and exposed breaking through the shield of ideology of romantic love.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

From very early on, teachers and scholars who were all involved in historical education have remained fairly skeptical as well as critical of the idea or intent of assimilating the History curriculum into a larger Society education curriculum. Especially with the advent of the 2007 Education Plan, as divisional thinking was reinforced within the Plan itself, tension over the prospect of a larger Unified Society Education curriculum began and continued to rise. We are now are at a critical juncture, as we should decide between two available options either separate History education from the Society Education curriculum package(again), or try to teach and run History classes as part of a larger Society Educational curriculum.Examined in this article is actually the latter option, which could be labelled as History education maintained as part of a larger Social education curriculum, that could hopefully mark a significant turning point for elementary level history education, probably enabled by horizontal linking of different curriculums. In an effort to learn lessons from the past, how an (Elementary-level) Society education curriculum of such sort was arranged in the U.S., when it entered a multi-cultural era in the early years of the 20th century, and what kind of controversies it gave birth to, when such curriculum was first introduced to Korea and Japan, will all be consulted. Then, while discussing how such curriculum plan changed over the years, I would also like to comment upon certain historical education-related crises, which were caused by such curriculum plan. Third, in the current climate of debating over the right type of history education which would be suitable in training democratic citizens for the multi-cultural era, some accomplishments enabled by this very idea of tieing history education to Society education, will be highlighted as well.

Moreover it had reinforced the effective learning strategy for written and oral test.But Meritocracy as an Idea could turn ideology. In that case, the special competency could more rated than any other ability, and the individual ability would be considered only principle for distribution justice. Furthermore, meritocracy could violate the intrinsic educational criterion by credentialism, or rationalism.Therefore, the problem of excessive competition for entrance exam has not the simple solution by changing few collage admission test.

Optimal Data Scheduling and Admission Control for Backscatter Sensor Networks,2017,,,"PThis paper studies the data scheduling and admission control problem for a backscatter sensor network (BSN). In the network, instead of initiating their own transmissions, the sensors can send their data to the gateway just by switching their antenna impedance and reflecting the received RF signals. As such, we can reduce remarkably the complexity, the power consumption, and the implementation cost of sensor nodes. Different sensors may have different functions, and data collected from each sensor may also have a different status, e.g., urgent or normal, and thus we need to take these factors into account. Therefore, in this paper, we first introduce a system model together with a mechanism in order to address the data collection and scheduling problem in the BSN. We then propose an optimization solution using the Markov decision process framework and a reinforcement learning algorithm based on the linear function approximation method, with the aim of finding the optimal data collection policy for the gateway. Through simulation results, we not only show the efficiency of the proposed solution compared with other baseline policies, but also present the analysis for data admission control policy under different classes of sensors as well as different types of data.P",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The analysis of the analysis text of 52 high school students readers on The day of novelist Kubo, revealed the following perception of reality. The results are as follows. return to subjective perception of reality before novel experience, mutual reality recognition through novel experience, and meta interpretation and reconstruction of reality recognition. Each was stepped into a first - person reality recognition, a second person reality recognition, and a third person reality recognition. Learning readers who showed first-person perception of reality tended to return to or reinforce their existing perception of reality rather than experiencing the text world of the novel. The readers who had perceived the second - person reality revealed the similarity of their perception of the reality and the perception of the other, and expressed the attitude of mutual dialogue. Readers who have reached the perception of the third person have re-read the world around them through the text world and have prearranged their own consciousness of the reality in this process. In addition, he showed the reflexive ability to reconcile the authors perception of reality and to communicate with it, and to perceive his own reality as well. Through this analysis, this study proposed a method of education for realistic perception growth of readers. It was designed to provide an educational medium in accordance with the perception of reality that readers reached. First, in the first - person recognition phase of reality, listening and fictional conversation about fictional other is called novel text. In the second personality recognition stage, reading texts of his own interpretation texts and his own interpretation codes were suggested.

Also, the meaning of such policy is evaluated here as well.  As it was widely believed by scholars that the Korean war was started by North Korea, the mobilization process of the North Korean army was never fully examined. But if we consider the simple fact that a functioning military could only be sustained and expanded upon a socio-economic platform already in place, it becomes clear that an understanding of the North Korean troop mobilization policy would allow us to look inside the North Korean society at the time of its moving into war.  In order to swiftly mobilize troops, the North Korean authorities first reorganized the military service system. The basic principle of maintaining a volunteer system was kept intact, but elements of a conscription(drafting) system were also grafted upon it. The authorities surveyed possible candidates whereabouts and numbers, and then performed mobilization tests, in order to select and manage candidates suited for the service. Also, in order to minimize the economic loss of the families who had members mobilized for military service, and create an atmosphere which was not against or hostile to constant mobilization of troops, military aiding projects also went underway. Political education and mental training was also reinforced, in order to respond to or even prevent possible emergences of anti-regime voices or factions within the military.  In the meantime, large scale mobilization of military troops could have caused severe drop in overall state production, as North Korea had already been suffering from chronic shortage of workforce. In response to this problem, the North Korean leadership newly defined the identity of the North Korean army, which was redesigned as a unit that would politically enlighten the North Korean youths, and train them to learn skills and attitude necessary for productive labor.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
A study on the growth mechanism of Burger King based on dynamic models of success and failure of businesses,2017,"['fast food', 'growth', 'erosion', 'stagnation', 'resonance', 'success and failure of businesses', 'dynamic model', 'franchise']",,"Purpose  This study is to propose a creative idea for constant business growth and development by examining characteristics of business outcomes by phase, which are growth and erosion and stagnation, respectively.Research design, data, and methodology  It is necessary to identify an occurrence of crisis and its diffusion with a dynamic model in order to identify a success and failure of businesses in an organic way, not on a binary structure. According to Dynamic Understanding of the Success and Failure of Businesses published in 2007 by Samsung Economics Research Institute (SERI), the success and failure of the business can be analyzed largely by dynamic and static perspectives. The static perspective is to understand a crisis as a simply one-time event or as a linear causation. Thus, it has a limited understanding of the overall situation and has limits to investigating a foundational cause and developing long-term countermeasures. On the contrary, the dynamic perspective is to understand the crisis as circulation process of the overall system. Thus, it divides elements of the crisis as external and internal ones to understand it as the causal relationship of each element. Considering that the crisis is caught in a viscous circle and triggers a chain reaction amid the internally accumulated fear factors interacting with the external threat-causing ones, there is no option but to take the dynamic perspective which is more valid than the static one in organically identifying the success and failure of businesses. In the dynamic model of success and failure of businesses, the growth means the virtuous cycle, where the strength of corporate system enhances management achievementperformance, which consequently reinforces the system capacity. Next, the erosion is the stage where the growth loop goes habitual and lose suitability, which progresses with the growth loop at the same time. Resonance, which is the pre-stage of the decline, is where both internal erosion elements and external threat factors interact, which leads to deterioration of business performances and disturbance of the system. Lastly, the decline is the changing process where the shock from the resonance goes beyond the absorption and control capacity of the initial system, which becomes vicious circle from the virtuous cycle.Results - During the growth period of Burger King, the company promoted its brand very successfully with aggressive and creative marketing activities. However, due to the founders disposal of management rights and the following changes in the management, the company had no choice but to lose focus on its business philosophy and brand management, and eventually it had to face the big crisis (resonance) which was delisting from the stock market because of the external threat well-being trend. However, Burger King resumed lifting on the stock exchange by making great efforts to clearly identify the current issues and seek solutions. Under the spirit of perseverance and its slogan Have it your way the company is now going head to head with McDonalds in the North American region and emerging countries.Conclusions  Then, what is the most crucial factor in the success and failure of businesses? Answers may vary, however, as learned from the case study of Burger King, corporations should inspect the present and focus on developing a long-term strategy for the future and actively fulfill the actions. McDonalds may not be able to innovate by itself in the future as it may become routinized to the growth. There will be chances of winning if we change conditions of individuals or organizations to an organic system in terms of being creative. There is a hopeful message here that an individual or small business may have more advantages in the era of the idea and innovation.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

When highly perceived of the insult by verbal violence, anger thought of the tendency to blame others, revenge, and helplessness became higher. Therefore it is important to prevent verbal violence occurrence, however it is also important to compensate the victim of verbal violence by mental treatment and monetary compensation. On the contrary to this, there should be proper restriction (reduction in salary, expel, suspension, etc.) to the inflictor and this practice should be introduced to employees on a regular basis. Second, when highly perceived of cognitive and emotional self encouragement, anger though decreased even though highly perceived of verbal violence.

The disasters of the Joseon Dynasty can be divided into Chun-byeon() and Gi-byeon(). Chun-byeon was often used as a symbol of the Emperor, and Gi-byeon was often used as a symbol of people.During the Reign of King Injos natural phenomena can be identified through a variety of feeds. The chronology and the Jeung-Bo-Mun-Heon-Bi-Go() show that natural phenomena are concentrated in the 17th century Joseon Dynasty, and King injos age also shows that the incidence of various natural phenomena was high. Looking records of natural disaster Zaiyi-go() shows the catastrophes were understood as the national crisis and disaster.In the case of Gi-byeon, it can be grasped as a whole through the records of Joseon Dynasty Records. Especially, Gi-byeon was understood to be very important because it is directly related to farming.The Theory of disaster () of the Joseon Dynasty was discussed in the framework of Mutual Resonance between Tian() and human beings() of Dong-Jung-Seo()s. At this time, the Dong-Jung-Seo emphasized the virtue, and as a result, the Zhu-Xi studies() was further utilized, and the character of the Learning for the Ruler became stronger.King Injo tried to actively participate in the administration of the government in the early years of his reign, and his willingness showed to the society facing Zaiyi. King Injo performed by self() for a ritual for rain and hoping to realize the Min-Bon() and wanted to get confirm his status as an Emperor.However, the war of 1636() was the pivot point of King Injo to change his active attitude. The war gave humiliation to King Injo as a king, and at the same time, he lost the absolute monarchy through Chun-byeon, the war. It seemed that it is hard to utilize the Chun-byeon for his status as a tool to reinforce the kings power again. After the war of 1636, King Injo did not take any action even if the Chun-byeon occurred, and this was transferred to the mediators, which made it impossible for him to use it for politics anymore.King Injo, although Chun-byeon and Gi-byeon occurred together, he used only gu-eon() as an instability motivative, which should be regarded as an intentional act. Even though Gu-eon came down through Gi-byeon, the conventional attitude remained, which can be understood as a rejection of the political act itself. Nonetheless, King Injo steadily took Zaiyi on a minimum responsibility for the rest by lowering Gu-eon.Instead of avoiding political containment through Zaiyi, King Injo showed an attitude of working for Civil Welfare. King Injo was reluctant to go politically, but he performed rituals for rain and opened rice storages in efforts to salvage the poor actively.King Injos attention to Gi-byeon rather than Chun-byeon, and the actively responding attitude later changed the role of the emperor as active one rather than a symbolic one later in Joseon era. King Injo also played a role in raising the Min-Bon() principle in Zaiyi.

These wars were usually won when one side was either pushed back in disarray or encircled, and a combination of the two opposing formation unclear?. This fighting depends in part on skill in combat by those in the front rank, and in part on the physical and moral support of the rank behind them. The two opposing formations meet each other with clash of shield on shield and blow of spear against spear. In the hoplite line the soldiers were packed closely together, the individual man relying on his right hand comrade for protection because his own shield, on his left arm, could not adequately cover his right side. Thus hand-to-hand fighting might continue until only a handful of survivors were left they held out against each other for a long time.The individual hoplite soldiers were adult citizen males and they represented a code of manliness and morality that was deeply ingrained in hoplits warfare. The sense of comradeship fostered by this warfare was further reinforced by the shared hardships of campaigning.

To analyze teaching material contents, this study used communicative events analysis method of anthropology and sociolinguistics with the following elemets of analysis 1) Major categories of school communicative events based on the communication scenes (background and purpose) and participant elements. 2) Linguistic environment that specializes school communicative events based on the communication message form and interaction rule elements. As a result of analysis, many cases were found that reflect school life in communication background or participant elements but in the purpose element, it was hard to describe actual aspect of school communication in many cases. Even linguistic environment aspect was confined to QA type colloquial style and so it was difficult to check any colloquial style cases that have more elaborate language attribute. Especially, this study could find that reflection of school communicative authenticity is remarkably low in Standard Korean1. Based on the analysis so far, this study suggested reconfiguration of Standard Korean teaching material in three aspects. Firstly, reinforcement of school communicative authenticity cases in Standard Korean1 secondly, considering communicative authenticity cases of learning purpose thirdly, reinforcement of communicative events of elaborated language both in colloquial and literary styles.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

It specifically selects Kim Sowols Azalea, and discusses the parting emotions education.At present, Korean language education in China is influenced by pragmatism and mercantilism. It mainly focuses on improving students practical language communication ability and ignoring the essence of foreign language education - the improvement of cultural literacy. Foreign language education should improve the students cultural literacy through education and promote personal development. Emotion is an important element of cultural literacy, through emotional education students can increase the total amount of emotion, and improve their emotional communication skills.This study constructs the teaching scheme of emotional education from the perspective of social-cognitive constructivism education. Specifically, the education process is divided into three stages.The first stage allows students to experience the feelings of poetry in their respective positions. At this stage, students are mainly focused on emotional vocabulary, through which to experience poetic emotion. In the second stage, through comparing Azalea and Saying Good-bye to Cambridge Again by Chinese poet Xu Zhimo, students can summerize the similarities and differences in the parting emotions expressed in the two poems and reinforce their emotional experiences. In the third stage, students emotions can be expanded through the group discussion. Students emotional experiences vary since they have different priori, knowledge and interests. In the group discussion students share their own experience or emotion, expanding the emotional range. The fourth stage is through the dialogue with critical text to deepen the emotional experience. Critics, usually learned readers, have more keen sensitivity than the average readers, so learners dialogue with criticism of the text can deepen the emotional experience of poetry. Chinas Korean language education can not be separated from improving the cultural quliteracy--the ultimate goal of education, not only should enable students to master Korean, but also must improve their cultural accomplishments such as emotional communication skills.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

However CBD only suggested three principles such as prior informed consent, fair and equitable benefit sharing, and mutually agreed terms, therefore, all these needed shaping up. In October 2010, Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and The Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to The CBD hereafter Nagoya Protocol was adopted for shaping up the ABS system, increasing the transparency, strengthening implementation. In Korea, the Nagoya Protocol took effect from October 12supthsup of 2014. Also Access to Genetic Resources and Benefit Sharing Law hereafter Genetic Resource Law, which seem minimum domestic legislative requirement of the protocol, was enacted in Korea in 2017. Korea uses lots of foreign origin genetic resources. Accordingly, Korea needs thorough analysis and counter strategy concerning Nagoya Protocol and introduces more concrete and detailed domestic legal system as well as finds a reasonable policies. The Genetic Resource Law of Korea is insufficient for the access and use of foreign genetic resources, therefore it needs to be revised into more elaborated and concrete contents in the consideration of future benefit to Korea.Regarding the revision, references can be available from the EU regulation, which supports the argument of the developed countries, excludes derivatives from Genetic Resources, limit objects of ABS to the genetic resources acquired after Nagoya Protocol becomes effective and rule follow-up application and commercialization based on new development out of the objects of ABS. Also, in order to support the ABS system, the more concrete and strict standards of patentability, particularly for genetic resources, should be applied in Korea.Korea should strive for the reinforcement of international bargaining power such as the amendment processing of Nagoya Protocol. The amendment direction of Nagoya Protocol could be summarized as reinforcing the clarity and concreteness of the Protocol, reflection of benefit to Korea and establishment of international ABS dispute settlement body. Especially the daft articles of The Protection of Traditional Knowledge of WIPO provides that Traditional knowledge refers toincludesmeans, for the purposes of this instrument, know-how, skills, innovations, practices, teachings and learnings of indigenous peoples and local communitiesor a state or states. The draft articles enlarges the definition of traditional knowledge into any ethnic or national knowledge other than that held by indigenous and local communities. And following to the completed definition of WIPO, amendment of CBD and Nagoya Protocol should be carried forward to unify the definition of traditional knowledge of ABS.Korean government should obtain intellectual property like patent through excavation search of retentive genetic resources or needs to support those efforts in national level.

According to the analysis of this study, percentages of correct answers of students with percentage tasks were lower than we expected, approximately 50. Comparing the percentages of correct answers according to the task types, the part-whole tasks are higher than the comparison and change tasks, the geometric tasks are approximately equal to the algebraic tasks, and the find percentage tasks are higher than the find whole and find part tasks. As to the strategies that students employed, the percentage of using the formal strategy is not much higher than that of using the informal strategy, even after learning the formal strategy. As an insightful approach for teaching percentages, based on the study results, it is suggested to reinforce the meaning of percentage, include various types of the comparison and change tasks, emphasize the informal strategy explicitly using models prior to the formal strategy, and understand the relations among part, whole and percentage throughly in various percentage situations before calculating.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

As a result of analyzing the 2015 Revised National Curriculum in the General Guidelines, the Dokdo Island education is selected as one of the major cross curricular themes and presented with teaching content elements. And, the Dokdo Island education is presented as a concrete example for the Creative Activity Education in the Curriculum Guide. These points clearly demonstrate that there is a dramatic improvement of the Dokdo Island education. As a result of analyzing the 2015 Revised National Curriculum in the Subject area Curriculum, the remarkable reinforcement of the Dokdo Island education is found. In the Curriculum of Practical Art, the Dokdo Island educational objectives are not only just to understand the value of Dokdo, but also to prepare measures to protect national territory. In the Curriculum of Social Studies, the contents and levels of the Dokdo Island education has became more and deeper. In Social Studies subject, there is a special teaching unit for the Dokdo Island education, the history of protecting Dokdo is emphasized in history education, and the field trip to Dokdo and activity for experience are stressed in geography education. In History subject, the Dokdo Island educational objectives are not only just to understand illegal Dokdo disseisin by Japanese imperialism, but also to have an ability to refute Japans distorted claims to the Dokdo islands. In Korean History subject, the Dokdo Island educational objectives are preparing measures to promote the Korean controlled Dokdo and response to Japanese History distortions in addition to understand the value of Dokdo. In Korean Geography subject, there is a new unit of teaching Dokdo. In East Asia subject, the Dokdo Island education presents learning elements of Senkaku(Diaoyutai) islands, South Kuril Islands, Dokdo, and such.

In particular, social media has been widely adopted to arouse visitors interest in museum, encourage their participation and enrich the museum experience without the limit of time and space. As there is an increasing tendency of collaboration  either between the museum and their visitors or between specialists and the public, fundamentals of their relationship have changed while the role of the public has expanded. The public, who was simply a spectator in the past, now plays the role of prosumer, mediator, and marketer. Digital age brought a number of dilemmas to university museums in Korea, both internally and externally. Rapid development of digital technology as well as an increase in the number of visitors adept at social network services can be considered as a challenge which could threaten small-scale, low-budget university museums. Nevertheless, most of them are located in university campus, where prospective visitors include not only young students but also all age groups ranging from five- or six-year-old children to senior citizens over 60. This could also be a great opportunity for the oncampus research institutes and professionals from diverse fields to conduct various experiments in collaboration with the university museums. Furthermore, as a part of lifelong learning institution, the role of university museum has been expanded under the paradigm of visitor-centered museum. Ewha Womans University Museum, too, has organised exhibitions and events that lead to visitor engagement and participation by reinforcing its academic aspects and customizing advertising strategy to each specific target visitor group. This article has examined the visitor relations cases of the Ewha Womans University Museum, focusing particularly on 1) the use of social media and the virtual museum, and 2) the visitors participation. Based on the case study, the article proposes converting weakness and threat of university museums into strength and opportunity, and provides some differentiated marketing strategies and methods for visitors participation. Firstly, university museums should analyse and subdivide target visitor groups, and devise a method that brings them into the museum in multidirectional ways. Secondly, in order to attract multidisciplinary students and experts to the museum, specific participation method by which the museum uses online contributions to cumulate ideas and ultimately result in an academic achievement is also necessary. This method can be called crowdsourcing. Lastly, the museums need to collaborate with the universities research institutes and highly qualified specialists, and experiment for communication with visitors. The article expects that if university museums design easily accessible and enjoyable programmes, using highly advanced and systematic social media and the wisdom of crowds, they will be able to maximize their opportunities or advantages of having university faculties and students in the digital age.

불이()적 관점에서 본 기독교와 정토불교의 대화,2017,"['정토불교', '아미타', '예수', '인격성', '정각', '불이(不二)', 'Pure Land Buddhism', 'Personality', 'Amitabha', 'Jesus', 'Jeong-gak']",본 논문은 존 캅의 차이에 중심을 둔 다원주의적 관점에서 정토불교와 기독교 간의 대화를 시도하는데 그 목적이 있다. 두 종교 사이의 차이는 양자가 서로 대화의 접점이 될수 있는 아미타불의 인격성과 예수그리스도의 인격성을 비교하는 가운데 잘 드러난다. 주목할 점은 구원과 관련해서 정토불교가 단순히 극락정토에 태어나는 것을 구원의 최종목적으로 이해하고 있지 않다는 점이다. 불교가 말하는 구원의 궁극적 목적은 정토가 아니라 정각()이다. 이 부분은 천국에 가는 것이 최종 목적인 기독교와 분명한 차이로 인식된다. 그럼에도 불구하고 정토불교가 아미타의 타력신앙을 주장하는 이상 기독교로부터 배울 점이 있는데 그것은 바로 신과 인간사이의 교제와 만남을 통한 지속적이고 인격적인 관계 중심의 신앙생활이다. 이것은 불교 입장에서 볼 때도 자신들의 종교전통에 대한 불자들의 신뢰와 위임을 강화시키기 위해 꼭 필요한 요소가 될수 있을 것이다. 그러나 문제는 아미타의 타력구원의 본원력이 아미타와 부처의 인격적 행위에 기초한다는 사실을 불교인들이 자각하고 받아들일 수 있느냐 하는 것이다. 이 문제는 여전히 불교가 해결해야 할 과제로 남는다. 반면에 기독교는 예수의 십자가의 사건을 삼위일체 하나님의 구원의 완성으로 믿고 고백하지만 이를 단지 초월적 사건으로 받아들일 뿐 자신의 것으로 내면화 하려는 노력을 하지 않는다는 점에서 불교인들의 정각을 삶에 실천적 규범으로 받아들이지 않을 수 없을 것이다. 이는 기독교적 회심이 그동안 신자들 스스로의 구원을 향한 궁리()의 방편으로 이해되기 보다 구원 그 자체 또는 구원의 완성으로 이해하는 기독교의 과도한칭의론이 양산한 배타성과 편협함에 대한 반성으로서 기독교가 자기성찰의 과제로 삼아야 할 문제이다. 그 동안 교회는 예수그리스도의 십자가 사건을 자신들의 경험으로 완전히 내면화하지 못했다. 왜냐하면 기독교가 말하는 회심이란 분명 예수그리스도와의 인격적 만남을 의미하는 것이기 때문이다. 만남은 시작이지 끝이 아니다. 아울러 불교의 입장에서는 중생의 내면적 변화를 의미하는 불교적 회심 을 아미타의 회향을 매개로한 부처와의 인격적 만남의 관점에서 재조명해 봄으로써 아미타불에 대한 타력신앙을 예수 그리스도의 사역과 대치하여 생각해 보는 계기가 될 수 있을 것이다. 바라기는 본 논문을 통해 기독교가 불교로 부터 배울점은 없는지? 또 하나님과의 인격적 교호관계를 강조하는 기독교로부터 불교가 배울 것은 없는지를 살펴보고 두 종교간 대화의 가능성이 더 커지기를 희망해 본다.,"This paper aims to create a dialogue between Pure Land Buddhism and Christianity from Non-dualistic perspective. For that purpose, three primary scriptures of Pure Land Buddhism, known as Jeong-to-sam-bu-gyung, have been employed as major texts for the research. As a result, it reveals that there exists a distinctive difference between the two religions while both speak of salvation relying upon others.This difference between the two become even clearer by comparing personality of Amitabha and Jesus Christ. It is noteworthy that Pure Land Buddhism does not understand ultimate goal of salvation as merely to born again in the Land of Happiness (Jeong-to or the Elysian fields). Therefore, it is necessary to comprehend the Buddhist concept of buddhi (Jeong-gak) intellectual power to reason out what is right and what is wrongthat is only achievable in the Pure Land but not in reality.Therefore, what Buddhism seeks as an ultimate goal of salvation is not the Pure Land itself but the buddhi that is only possible in it. This can be understood as a clear difference from Christianity, which pursues going to heaven as its ultimate goal. Nevertheless, as long as Pure Land Buddhism insists on salvation by Amitabha and reliance upon others, there still remains one thing that Buddhism can learn from Christianity that is, a continuous and personal religious life through divine-human relationship.From Buddhisms perspective, this relationship-centered religious life can be an essential element to reinforce Buddhists trust on their own religious tradition. What becomes a problem is, however, whether Buddhists can realize and accept the fact that the very essence of salvation by Amitabha is actually based on personal action of Buddha. Even to this day, this remains as a problem for Buddhists to solve.On the other hand, Christianity cannot but accept the concept of buddhi as a practical norm for life, in that they have only believed and confessed the Cross of Jesus Christ as a transcendental event but not have endeavored to internalize its true meaning. As Christian conversion has been regarded simply as a salvation itself or as a completion of salvation thus far, due to excessive emphasis on justification by faith, Christianity now needs to take this problem seriously as a task for a self-reflection.Unfortunately, the Church has failed to fully internalize the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ as their own experience because so-called conversion was, in most cases, simply identified with personal encounter with the Christ however, encounter is beginning not the end of the internalization. Also, from Buddhists standpoint, this can be a good chance to contemplate their concept of salvation by Amitabha in a comparison with the ministry of Jesus Christ. By shedding new light on personal encounter with Buddha, Buddhists conversion and Amitabhas transfer of merit, hoe-hyang, could be better understood.Through this paper, it is expected to increase a chance for interreligious dialogue between the two religions as it examines what one could learn from the other.",reinforcement_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Feature Selection Algorithm for Intrusions Detection System using Sequential Forward Search and Random Forest Classifier,2017,"['FeatureSelection', 'SFFS', 'RandomForest', 'IDS']",,"Cyber attacks are evolving commensurate with recent developments in information security technology. Intrusion detection systems collect various types of data from computers and networks to detect security threats and analyze the attack information. The large amount of data examined make the large number of computations and low detection rates problematic. Feature selection is expected to improve the classification performance and provide faster and more cost-effective results. Despite the various feature selection studies conducted for intrusion detection systems, it is difficult to automate feature selection because it is based on the knowledge of security experts. This paper proposes a feature selection technique to overcome the performance problems of intrusion detection systems. Focusing on feature selection, the first phase of the proposed system aims at constructing a feature subset using a sequential forward floating search (SFFS) to downsize the dimension of the variables. The second phase constructs a classification model with the selected feature subset using a random forest classifier (RFC) and evaluates the classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted with the NSL-KDD dataset using SFFS-RF, and the results indicated that feature selection techniques are a necessary preprocessing step to improve the overall system performance in systems that handle large datasets. They also verified that SFFS-RF could be used for data classification. In conclusion, SFFS-RF could be the key to improving the classification model performance in machine learning.",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
A Variable Impacts Measurement in Random Forest for Mobile Cloud Computing,2017,,,"PRecently, the importance of mobile cloud computing has increased. Mobile devices can collect personal data from various sensors within a shorter period of time and sensor-based data consists of valuable information from users. Advanced computation power and data analysis technology based on cloud computing provide an opportunity to classify massive sensor data into given labels. Random forest algorithm is known as black box model which is hardly able to interpret the hidden process inside. In this paper, we propose a method that analyzes the variable impact in random forest algorithm to clarify which variable affects classification accuracy the most. We apply Shapley Value with random forest to analyze the variable impact. Under the assumption that every variable cooperates as players in the cooperative game situation, Shapley Value fairly distributes the payoff of variables. Our proposed method calculates the relative contributions of the variables within its classification process. In this paper, we analyze the influence of variables and list the priority of variables that affect classification accuracy result. Our proposed method proves its suitability for data interpretation in black box model like a random forest so that the algorithm is applicable in mobile cloud computing environment.P",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Biological Feature Selection and Disease Gene Identification using New Stepwise Random Forests,2017,"['Bioinformatics', 'Classification', 'Feature Evaluation and Selection', 'Modeling and Prediction']",,"Identifying disease genes from human genome is a critical task in biomedical research. Important biological features to distinguish the disease genes from the non-disease genes have been mainly selected based on traditional feature selection approaches. However, the traditional feature selection approaches unnecessarily consider many unimportant biological features. As a result, although some of the existing classification techniques have been applied to disease gene identification, the prediction performance was not satisfactory. A small set of the most important biological features can enhance the accuracy of disease gene identification, as well as provide potentially useful knowledge for biologists or clinicians, who can further investigate the selected biological features as well as the potential disease genes. In this paper, we propose a new stepwise random forests (SRF) approach for biological feature selection and disease gene identification. The SRF approach consists of two stages. In the first stage, only important biological features are iteratively selected in a forward selection manner based on one-dimensional random forest regression, where the updated residual vector is considered as the current response vector. We can then determine a small set of important biological features. In the second stage, random forests classification with regard to the selected biological features is applied to identify disease genes. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed SRF approach outperforms the existing feature selection and classification techniques in terms of biological feature selection and disease gene identification.",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

However, because SAR data are in grayscale, it is difficult to perform visual analysis and to decipher details. In this study, we propose a color mapping method using RF (random forest) regression for enhancing the visual decipherability of SAR images. COSMO-SkyMed 2 and WorldView-3 images were obtained for the same area and RF regression was used to establish color configurations for performing color mapping. The results were compared with image fusion, a traditional color mapping method. The UIQI (universal image quality index), the SSIM (structural similarity) index, and CC (correlation coefficients) were used to evaluate the image quality. The color-mapped image based on the RF regression had a significantly higher quality than the images derived from the other methods. From the experimental result, the use of color mapping based on the RF regression for SAR images was confirmed.",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

These  forests support more than half of the worlds species, serve as regulators of global and regional climate, act as carbon  sinks and provide valuable ecosystem services. Forest floor biomass and litterfall dynamics was measured in different  sites influenced by fire in a seasonally dry tropical forest of Bhoramdeo wildlife sanctuary of Chhattisgarh, India. The  forest floor biomass was collected randomly placed quadrats while the litterfall measured by placing stone-block lined  denuded quadrat technique. The seasonal mean total forest floor biomass across the fire regimes varied from 2.00-3.65 t  ha-1. The total litterfall of the study sites varied from 4.75-7.56 t ha-1 yr-1. Annual turnover of litter varied from 70- 74 and the turnover time between 1.35-1.43 years. Monthly pattern of forest floor biomass indicated that partially  decayed litter, wood litter and total forest floor were differed significantly. The seasonal variation showed that leaf  fall differed significantly in winter season only among the fire regimes while the wood litter was found non significant  in all the season. This study shows that significant variation among the site due to the forest fire. Decomposition is  one of the ecological processes critical to the functioning of forest ecosystems.

For dioecious plants, differences in reproduction cost between sexes and sizes might affect their spatial distribution. Abiotic heterogeneity may also affect adaptation activities, and result in a unique spatial structure of the population. Thus, we examined sex- and size-related spatial distributions of old-growth forest of dioecious tree Torreya nucifera in extremely heterogeneous Gotjawal terrain of Jeju Island, South Korea.Methods We generated a database of location, sex, and size (DBH) of T. nucifera trees for each quadrat (160  300 m) in each of the three sites previously defined (quadrat A, B, C in Site I, II, and III, respectively). T. nucifera trees were categorized into eight groups based on sex (males vs. females), size (small vs. large trees), and sex by size (small vs.large males, and small vs. large females) for spatial point pattern analysis. Univariate and bivariate spatial analyses were conducted.Results Univariate spatial analysis showed that spatial patterns of T. nucifera trees differed among the three quadrats.In quadrat A, individual trees showed random distribution at all scales regardless of sex and size groups. When assessing univariate patterns for sex by size groups in quadrat B, small males and small females were distributed randomly at all scales whereas large males and large females were clumped. All groups in quadrat C were clustered at short distances but the pattern changed as distance was increased. Bivariate spatial analyses testing the association between sex and size groups showed that spatial segregation occurred only in quadrat C. Males and females were spatially independent at all scales. However, after controlling for size, males and females were spatially separated.Conclusions Diverse spatial patterns of T. nucifera trees across the three sites within the Torreya Forest imply that adaptive explanations are not sufficient for understanding spatial structure in this old-growth forest. If so, the role of Gotjawal terrain in terms of creating extremely diverse microhabitats and subsequently stochastic processes of survival and mortality of trees, both of which ultimately determine spatial patterns, needs to be further examined.",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Adaptive Prediction Method Based on Alternating Decision Forests with Considerations for Generalization Ability,2017,"['Data Mining', 'Big Data', 'Prediction Model', 'Random Forests', 'Alternating Decision Forests']",,"Many machine learning algorithms have been proposed and applied to a wide range of prediction problems in the field of industrial management. Lately, the amount of data is increasing and machine learning algorithms with low computational costs and efficient ensemble methods are needed. Alternating Decision Forest (ADF) is an efficient ensemble method known for its high performance and low computational costs. ADFs introduce weights representing the degree of prediction accuracy for each piece of training data and randomly select attribute variables for each node. This method can effectively construct an ensemble model that can predict training data accurately while allowing each decision tree to retain different features. However, outliers can cause overfitting, and since candidates of branch conditions vary for nodes in ADFs, there is a possibility that prediction accuracy will deteriorate because the fitness of training data is highly restrained. In order to improve prediction accuracy, we focus on the prediction results for new data. That is to say, we introduce bootstrap sampling so that the algorithm can generate out-of-bag (OOB) datasets for each tree in the training phase. Additionally, we construct an effective ensemble of decision trees to improve generalization ability by considering the prediction accuracy for OOB data. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct simulation experiments using the UCI machine learning repository. This method provides robust and accurate predictions for datasets with many attribute variables.",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Thus the study objective was to identify the local peoples perceptions and preferences on baobab trees and products. A sample of 142 respondents was randomly selected using structured interviews in Blue Nile and North Kordofan, Sudan in 2013. Descriptive analysis was employed using SPSS and Excel programs. The study results indicated that local people use the morphological characteristics of the tree (leaves, fruits, seeds, kernels and bark) to differentiate individual trees. Based on the perceptions, local people recorded trees with delicious leaves, white pulp color, big fruit size and mature capsule size, and high pulp yield as criteria for differentiating between baobab trees in the study areas. In contrast, the undesirable traits were connected to trees with acidic pulp, slimy pulp, bitter leaves, and low pulp yield. The study concluded that the ethnobotanical knowledge of the baobab tree and its products may play an important role in tree domestication and improvement in Sudan. However, further research on tree genetics is needed to complement the ethnobotanical knowledge for baobab resources domestication and conservation.",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The  experiment was arranged in a factorial experiment of 333 in a completely randomized design (CRD) with three  replicates. The factors were soil textural class (Loamy sand, Sand and Sandy clay loam), watering regime (daily, twice a  week and once a week) and light intensity (100, 75 and 50). Soil textural classes had significant influence on  collar diameter, stem height, number of leaflets, rootshoot ratio and relative growth rate of Tetrapleura seedlings.  Seedlings grown on loamy sand recorded the highest mean value- 2.28 mm for collar diameter, stem height- 12.9 cm,  number of leaflets- 19.9, chlorophyll b- 0.34 mg mL-1, leaf relative water content- 27.4 and relative growth rate-  0.037 mg g-1 day-1. Watering regime had significant influence on the collar diameter of Tetrapleura. Seedlings watered  daily recorded the highest mean value- 2.25 mm for collar diameter. Light intensity significantly influenced collar  diameter and rootshoot ratio. Seedlings exposed to 100 light intensity recorded higher mean value for collar diameter-  2.28 mm and rootshoot ratio- 1.481 cm. The interaction between soil textural class and light intensity significantly  affected collar diameter, stem height and number of leaflets. Higher mean value for collar diameter (2.47 mm) stem  height (13.25 cm) and number of leaflets (21.16) were recorded while the interaction between soil textural class, light  intensity and watering regime was significant for only number of leaflets. Tetrapleura exhibited some level of tolerance to  different soil texture, drought and light intensity.

Since the spatial distribution of heat in a city varies by region, it is crucial to investigate detailed thermal characteristics of urban areas. Recently, many studies have been conducted to identify thermal characteristics of urban areas using satellite data. However, satellite data are not sufficient for precise analysis due to the trade-off of temporal and spatial resolutions. In this study, in order to examine the thermal characteristics of Daegu Metropolitan City during the summers between 2012 and 2016, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST) data at 1 km spatial resolution were downscaled to a spatial resolution of 250 m using a machine learning method called random forest. Compared to the original 1 km LST, the downscaled 250 m LST showed a higher correlation between the proportion of impervious areas and mean land surface temperatures in Daegu by the administrative neighborhood unit. Hot spot analysis was then conducted using downscaled daytime and nighttime 250 m LST. The clustered hot spot areas for daytime and nighttime were compared and examined based on the land cover data provided by the Ministry of Environment. The high-value hot spots were relatively more clustered in industrial and commercial areas during the daytime and in residential areas at night. The thermal characterization of urban areas using the method proposed in this study is expected to contribute to the establishment of city and national security policies.",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Brain atlas fusion from high-thickness diagnostic magnetic resonance images by learning-based super-resolution,2017,"['Brain atlas', 'Super-resolution', 'Image enhancement', 'Sparsity learning', 'Random forest regression', 'Groupwise registration']",,"PBAbstractBP  PIt is fundamentally important to fuse the brain atlas from magnetic resonance (MR) images for many imaging-based studies. Most existing works focus on fusing the atlases from high-quality MR images. However, for low-quality diagnostic images (i.e., with high inter-slice thickness), the problem of atlas fusion has not been addressed yet. In this paper, we intend to fuse the brain atlas from the high-thickness diagnostic MR images that are prevalent for clinical routines. The main idea of our works is to extend the conventional groupwise registration by incorporating a novel super-resolution strategy. The contribution of the proposed super-resolution framework is two-fold. First, each high-thickness subject image is reconstructed to be isotropic by the patch-based sparsity learning. Then, the reconstructed isotropic image is enhanced for better quality through the random-forest-based regression model. In this way, the images obtained by the super-resolution strategy can be fused together by applying the groupwise registration method to construct the required atlas. Our experiments have shown that the proposed framework can effectively solve the problem of atlas fusion from the low-quality brain MR images.P    PBHighlightsBP P UL LI  We fuse the brain atlas from real diagnostic MR images with high inter-slice thickness.

For detecting candidate light blobs, the region of interest (ROI) is decided as front ROI (FROI) and back ROI (BROI) by considering the camera geometry based on perspective range estimation model. Then, light blobs such as headlights, taillights of vehicles, reflection light as well as the surrounding road lighting are segmented using two different adaptive thresholding. From the number of segmented blobs, taillights are first detected using the redness checking and random forest classifier based on Haar-like feature. For the headlight and taillight classification, we use the random forest instead of popular support vector machine or convolutional neural networks for supporting fast learning and testing in real-life applications. Pairing is performed by using the predefined geometric rules, such as vertical coordinate similarity and association check between blobs. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to various driving sequences in night-time, and the results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms is better than that of recent related works.",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
UAV-based Land Cover Mapping Technique for Monitoring Coastal Sand Dunes,2017,"['UAV', 'Vegetation Classification', 'Random Forest', 'Sand Dune', 'Multispectral Image']",,"In recent years, coastal dune erosion has accelerated as various structures have been developed around the coastal dunes. A land cover map should be developed to identify the characteristics of sand dunes and to monitor the condition of sand dunes.

The decision tree algorithm and random forest were implemented in R programming language. We defined a high risk of sICH as more than the average number of cases daily, and the younger, middle-aged and older groups were calculated as having 0.77, 2.26 and 2.60 cases per day, respectively. In total, 22,684 sICH cases were included in this study 3,102 patients were younger (44 years, younger group), 9,089 were middle-aged (4564 years, middle group), and 10,457 were older (65 years, older group). The risk of sICH in the younger group was not correlated with temperature, wind speed or humidity. The middle group had two decision nodes a higher risk if the maximum temperature was 19C (probability  63.7), and if the maximum temperature was 19C in addition to a wind speed 2.788 (ms) (probability  60.9). The older group had a higher risk if the average temperature was 23.933C (probability  60.7). This study demonstrated that the sICH incidence in the younger patients was not significantly correlated with weather factors that in the middle-aged sICH patients was highly-correlated with the apparent temperature and that in the older sICH patients was highly-correlated with the mean ambient temperature. Warm cold ambient temperatures resulted in a higher risk of sICH, especially in the older patients.",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Regularized random forests and linear regression models were used to identify and evaluate predictors of the positivity and magnitude of durable immune responses.P   PBResultsBP PWe analyzed 201 vaccine recipients with data from 10 to 127 immune response biomarkers, and 35 demographic variables. The best prediction of participants durable response positivity based on two-week responses rendered up to close-to-perfect accuracy the best prediction of participants durable response magnitude rendered correlation coefficients between the observed and predicted responses ranging up to 0.91.

Early Detection of Sudden Pedestrian Crossing for Safe Driving During Summer Nights,2017,,,"PSudden pedestrian crossing (SPC) is the major reason for pedestrian-vehicle crashes. In this paper, we focus on detecting SPCs at night for supporting an advanced driver assistance system using a far-infrared (FIR) camera mounted on the front roof of a vehicle. Although the thermal temperature of the road is similar to or higher than that of the pedestrians during summer nights, many previous researches have focused on pedestrian detection during the winter, spring, or autumn seasons. However, our research concentrates on SPC during the hot summer season because the number of collisions between pedestrians and vehicles in Korea is higher at that time than during the other seasons. For real-time processing, we first decide the optimal levels of image scaling and search area. We then use our proposed method for detecting virtual reference lines that are associated with road segmentation without using color information and change these lines according to the turning direction of the vehicle. Pedestrian detection is conducted using a cascade random forest with low-dimensional Haar-like features and oriented center-symmetric local binary patterns. The SPC is predicted based on the likelihood and the spatiotemporal features of the pedestrians, such as their overlapping ratio with virtual reference lines, as well as the direction and magnitude of each pedestrians movement. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to various pedestrian data sets captured by an FIR camera, and the results show that its SPC detection performance is better than those of other methods.P",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

A Machine-Learning Based Approach for Extracting Logical Structure of a Styled Document,2017,"['Logical Structure Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Feature Vector', 'Document Management System']",,"A styled document is a document that contains diverse decorating functions such as different font, colors, tables and images generally authored in a word processor (e.g., MS-WORD, Open Office). Compared to a plain-text document, a styled document enables a human to easily recognize a logical structure such as section, subsection and contents of a document. However, it is difficult for a computer to recognize the structure if a writer does not explicitly specify a type of an element by using the styling functions of a word processor. It is one of the obstacles to enhance document version management systems because they currently manage the document with a file as a unit, not the document elements as a management unit. This paper proposes a machine learning based approach to analyzing the logical structure of a styled document composing of sections, subsections and contents. We first suggest a feature vector for characterizing document elements from a styled document, composing of eight features such as font size, indentation and period, each of which is a frequently discovered item in a styled document.

So far many steelmakers generally have used visual inspection method that could be based on an inspectors intuition or experience. Specifically, the inspector checks the steel plate faults by looking the surface of the steel plates. However, the accuracy of this method is critically low that it can cause errors above 30 in judgment. Therefore, accurate steel plate faults diagnosis system has been continuously required in the industry. In order to meet the needs, this study proposed a new steel plate faults diagnosis system using Simultaneous MTS (S-MTS), which is an advanced Mahalanobis Taguchi System (MTS) algorithm, to classify various surface defects of the steel plates. MTS has generally been used to solve binary classification problems in various fields, but MTS was not used for multiclass classification due to its low accuracy. The reason is that only one mahalanobis space is established in the MTS. In contrast, S-MTS is suitable for multi-class classification. That is, S-MTS establishes individual mahalanobis space for each class. Simultaneous implies comparing mahalanobis distances at the same time. The proposed steel plate faults diagnosis system was developed in four main stages. In the first stage, after various reference groups and related variables are defined, data of the steel plate faults is collected and used to establish the individual mahalanobis space per the reference groups and construct the full measurement scale. In the second stage, the mahalanobis distances of test groups is calculated based on the established mahalanobis spaces of the reference groups. Then, appropriateness of the spaces is verified by examining the separability of the mahalanobis diatances. In the third stage, orthogonal arrays and Signal-to-Noise (SN) ratio of dynamic type are applied for variable optimization. Also, Overall SN ratio gain is derived from the SN ratio and SN ratio gain. If the derived overall SN ratio gain is negative, it means that the variable should be removed. However, the variable with the positive gain may be considered as worth keeping. Finally, in the fourth stage, the measurement scale that is composed of selected useful variables is reconstructed. Next, an experimental test should be implemented to verify the ability of multi-class classification and thus the accuracy of the classification is acquired. If the accuracy is acceptable, this diagnosis system can be used for future applications. Also, this study compared the accuracy of the proposed steel plate faults diagnosis system with that of other popular classification algorithms including Decision Tree, Multi Perception Neural Network (MLPNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Tree Bagger Random Forest, Grid Search (GS), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The steel plates faults dataset used in the study is taken from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. As a result, the proposed steel plate faults diagnosis system based on S-MTS shows 90.79 of classification accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed diagnosis system is 6-27 higher than MLPNN, LR, GS, GA and PSO. Based on the fact that the accuracy of commercial systems is only about 75-80, it means that the proposed system has enough classification performance to be applied in the industry. In addition, the proposed system can reduce the number of measurement sensors that are installed in the fields because of variable optimization process. These results show that the proposed system not only can have a good ability on the steel plate faults diagnosis but also reduce operation and maintenance cost. For our future work, it will be applied in the fields to validate actual effectiveness of the proposed system and plan to improve the accuracy based on the results.",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

In order to predict stock price movements, research has been conducted not only on the relationship between text data and fluctuations in stock prices, but also on the trading stocks based on news articles and social media responses. Studies that predict the movements of stock prices have also applied classification algorithms with constructing term-document matrix in the same way as other text mining approaches.  Because the document contains a lot of words, it is better to select words that contribute more for building a term-document matrix. Based on the frequency of words, words that show too little frequency or importance are removed. It also selects words according to their contribution by measuring the degree to which a word contributes to correctly classifying a document.  The basic idea of constructing a term-document matrix was to collect all the documents to be analyzed and to select and use the words that have an influence on the classification. In this study, we analyze the documents for each individual item and select the words that are irrelevant for all categories as neutral words. We extract the words around the selected neutral word and use it to generate the term-document matrix. The neutral word itself starts with the idea that the stock movement is less related to the existence of the neutral words, and that the surrounding words of the neutral word are more likely to affect the stock price movements. And apply it to the algorithm that classifies the stock price fluctuations with the generated term-document matrix.  In this study, we firstly removed stop words and selected neutral words for each stock. And we used a method to exclude words that are included in news articles for other stocks among the selected words. Through the online news portal, we collected four months of news articles on the top 10 market cap stocks. We split the news articles into 3 month news data as training data and apply the remaining one month news articles to the model to predict the stock price movements of the next day. We used SVM, Boosting and Random Forest for building models and predicting the movements of stock prices. The stock market opened for four months (20160201  20160531) for a total of 80 days, using the initial 60 days as a training set and the remaining 20 days as a test set. The proposed word - based algorithm in this study showed better classification performance than the word selection method based on sparsity.  This study predicted stock price volatility by collecting and analyzing news articles of the top 10 stocks in market cap. We used the term - document matrix based classification model to estimate the stock price fluctuations and compared the performance of the existing sparse - based word extraction method and the suggested method of removing words from the term - document matrix. The suggested method differs from the word extraction method in that it uses not only the news articles for the corresponding stock but also other news items to determine the words to extract. In other words, it removed not only the words that appeared in all the increase and decrease but also the words that appeared common in the news for other stocks. When the prediction accuracy was compared, the suggested method showed higher accuracy.  The limitation of this study is that the stock price prediction was set up to classify the rise and fall, and the experiment was conducted only for the top ten stocks. The 10 stocks used in the experiment do not represent the entire stock market. In addition, it is difficult to show the investment performance because stock price fluctuation and profit rate may be different. Therefore, it is necessary to study the research using more stocks and the yield prediction through trading simulation.",random_forest_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

In order to achieve the ever demanding needs of customers, it has to rapidly evolve and include a number of changes. In this paper, our aim is to study the relationship of object oriented metrics with change proneness attribute of a class. Prediction models based on this study can help us in identifying change prone classes of a software. We can then focus our efforts on these change prone classes during testing to yield a better quality software. Previously, researchers have used statistical methods for predicting change prone classes. But machine learning methods are rarely used for identification of change prone classes. In our study, we evaluate and compare the performances of ten machine learning methods with the statistical method. This evaluation is based on two open source software systems developed in Java language. We also validated the developed prediction models using other software data set in the same domain (3D modelling). The performance of the predicted models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The results indicate that the machine learning methods are at par with the statistical method for prediction of change prone classes. Another analysis showed that the models constructed for a software can also be used to predict change prone nature of classes of another software in the same domain. This study would help developers in performing effective regression testing at low cost and effort. It will also help the developers to design an effective model that results in less change prone classes, hence better maintenance.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

XSSClassifier An Efficient XSS Attack Detection Approach Based on Machine Learning Classifier on SNSs,2017,"['Cross-Site Scripting Attack Detection', 'Dataset', 'JavaScript', 'Machine Learning Classifier', 'Social Networking Services']",,"Social networking services (SNSs) such as Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook have become progressively significant with its billions of users. Still, alongside this increase is an increase in security threats such as crosssite scripting (XSS) threat. Recently, a few approaches have been proposed to detect an XSS attack on SNSs. Due to the certain recent features of SNSs webpages such as JavaScript and AJAX, however, the existing approaches are not efficient in combating XSS attack on SNSs. In this paper, we propose a machine learningbased approach to detecting XSS attack on SNSs. In our approach, the detection of XSS attack is performed based on three features URLs, webpage, and SNSs. A dataset is prepared by collecting 1,000 SNSs webpages and extracting the features from these webpages. Ten different machine learning classifiers are used on a prepared dataset to classify webpages into two categories XSS or non-XSS.

Large-scale machine learning of media outlets for understanding public reactions to nation-wide viral infection outbreaks,2017,"['Machine learning', 'Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)', 'Natural language processing', 'Sentiment analysis']",,"PFrom May to July 2015, there was a nation-wide outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Korea. MERS is caused by MERS-CoV, an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. Despite expert opinions that the danger of MERS might be exaggerated, there was an overreaction by the public according to the Korean mass media, which led to a noticeable reduction in social and economic activities during the outbreak. To explain this phenomenon, we presumed that machine learning-based analysis of media outlets would be helpful and collected a number of Korean mass media articles and short-text comments produced during the 10-week outbreak. To process and analyze the collected data (over 86 million words in total) effectively, we created a methodology composed of machine-learning and information-theoretic approaches. Our proposal included techniques for extracting emotions from emoticons and Internet slang, which allowed us to significantly (approximately 73) increase the number of emotion-bearing texts needed for robust sentiment analysis of social media. As a result, we discovered a plausible explanation for the public overreaction to MERS in terms of the interplay between the disease, mass media, and public emotions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Automatic Machine Fault Diagnosis System using Discrete Wavelet Transform and Machine Learning,2017,"['Pattern Recognition', 'Machine Learning', 'Machine Fault Diagnosis', 'Discrete Wavelet Transform', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Artificial Neural Network']",,"Sounds based machine fault diagnosis recovers all the studies that aim to detect automatically faults or damages on machines using the sounds emitted by these machines. Conventional methods that use mathematical models have been found inaccurate because of the complexity of the industry machinery systems and the obvious existence of nonlinear factors such as noises. Therefore, any fault diagnosis issue can be treated as a pattern recognition problem. We present here an automatic fault diagnosis system of hand drills using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and pattern recognition techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The diagnosis system consists of three steps. Because of the presence of many noisy patterns in our signals, we first conduct a filtering analysis based on DWT. Second, the wavelet coefficients of the filtered signals are extracted as our features for the pattern recognition part. Third, PCA is performed over the wavelet coefficients in order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors. Finally, the very first principal components are used as the inputs of an ANN based classifier to detect the wear on the drills.

Failure estimation of the composite laminates using machine learning techniques,2017,"['failure estimation', 'layup optimization', 'machine learning', 'finite element analysis', 'numerical analysis']",,"The problem of layup optimization of the composite laminates involves a very complex multidimensional solution space which is usually non-exhaustively explored using different heuristic computational methods such as genetic algorithms (GA). To ensure the convergence to the global optimum of the applied heuristic during the optimization process it is necessary to evaluate a lot of layup configurations. As a consequence the analysis of an individual layup configuration should be fast enough to maintain the convergence time range to an acceptable level. On the other hand the mechanical behavior analysis of composite laminates for any geometry and boundary condition is very convoluted and is performed by computational expensive numerical tools such as finite element analysis (FEA). In this respect some studies propose very fast FEA models used in layup optimization. However, the lower bound of the execution time of FEA models is determined by the global linear system solving which in some complex applications can be unacceptable. Moreover, in some situation it may be highly preferred to decrease the optimization time with the cost of a small reduction in the analysis accuracy. In this paper we explore some machine learning techniques in order to estimate the failure of a layup configuration. The estimated response can be qualitative (the configuration fails or not) or quantitative (the value of the failure factor). The procedure consists of generating a population of random observations (configurations) spread across solution space and evaluating using a FEA model. The machine learning method is then trained using this population and the trained model is then used to estimate failure in the optimization process.

Generally, it is very difficult to diagnose a machine fault by conventional methods based on mathematical models because of the complexity of the real world systems and the obvious existence of nonlinear factors.

The sounds emitted by the operating machine, a drill in this case, are obtained and analyzed for the different operating conditions. The specific machine conditions considered in this research are the undamaged drill and the defected drill with wear. Principal component analysis is first used to reduce the dimensionality of the original sound data. The first principal components are then used as the inputs of a neural network based classifier to separate normal and defected drill sound data.

Limitations of Machine Translation  Focused on the Role of Cognitive Complements in Human Communication,2017,"['기계번역', '자동통역', '자연어처리', '언어외적 맥락', '인지적 보완소', 'machine translation MT', 'automated interpreting', 'natural language processing NLP', 'extra-linguistic context', 'cognitive complements']",,"Significant progress has been made in machine translation since the introduction of the Neural-based Machine Translation (NMT) algorithms. For Korean-English translation, there is growing evidence that the machine translation engines are rendering more and more acceptable translations with time through deep learning. The progress inevitably raises the question of whether human expertise will eventually be replaced by machines. This question depends on whether and how much of the inter-lingual mediation process depends on inherently human capabilities. To understand the potential boundaries of machines translation, this study draws on the role of cognitive complements in face-to-face communication, focusing on spoken as opposed to the commonly researched written texts. The first part of the study discusses the role of cognitive complements in human communication. Then to illustrate the important role played by cognitive complements in human communication, the second part of the study explains the errors made by NMT from the perspective of cognitive complements, based on a sample text analysis using Google Translate. The analysis indicate that applying the current engine to face-to-face encounters has serious pragmatic risks. From the perspective of machine translation, therefore, the ability to apply cognitive complements like human beings, with the ability to draw on extra-linguistic context may be the key to making NMT ready for real-world applications as far as the processing of spoken texts is concerned. While effort is underway to relate sensory experience to text processing, enormous computing power requirement may be another obstacle before human interpreters can be replaced completely.

Multi-view based unlabeled data selection using feature transformation methods for semiboost learning,2017,"['SemiBoost learning', 'Useful unlabeled data selection', 'Multiple views of feature set', 'Feature decomposition methods']",,"PSemiBoost Mallapragada et al. (2009) is a boosting framework for semi-supervised learning, in which unlabeled data as well as labeled data both contribute to learning. Various strategies have been proposed in the literature to perform the task of selecting useful unlabeled data in SemiBoost. Recently, a multi-view based strategy was proposed in Le and Kim (2016), in which the feature set of the data is decomposed into subsets (i.e., multiple views) using a feature-decomposition method. In the decomposition process, the strategy inevitably results in some loss of information. To avoid this drawback, this paper considered feature-transformation methods, rather than using the decomposition method, to obtain the multiple views. More specifically, in the feature-transformation method, a number of views were obtained from the entire feature set using the same number of different mapping functions. After deriving the number of views of the data, each of the views was used for measuring corresponding confidences, for first evaluating examples to be selected. Then, all the confidence levels measured from the multiple views were combined as a weighted average for deriving a target confidence. The experimental results, which were obtained using support vector machines for well-known benchmark data, demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can compensate for the shortcomings of the traditional strategies. In addition, the results demonstrate that when the data is transformed appropriately into multiple views, the strategy can achieve further improvement in results in terms of classification accuracy.

Indoor Localization Without a Prior Map by Trajectory Learning From Crowdsourced Measurements,2017,,,"PAccommodation of a situation when a prior map is not available in an indoor localization system is valuable to cost-effective operations by removing a need for map drawing and map updating. This paper suggests a trajectory learning method using crowdsourced measurements in order to support the absence of map. A localization framework based on a particle filter is formalized by machine-learning-based feature extraction and Gaussian process (GP) regression. The feature extraction algorithm reduces dimensionality of sparse measurement vector, and it is applied to detect floor level and designated landmarks. Also, the combination of the feature extraction and the GP regression is used for modeling nonlinear relationship between location and measurement. By this combination, locations of Wi-Fi access points are not required to be known. From the field experimental results, we confirm that the detections of floor level and landmarks are accurate, the learned trajectories are close to the true map, and positioning accuracy is improved thanks to the learning-aided localization.P",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Simultaneous Kernel Learning and Label Imputation for Pattern Classification with Partially Labeled Data,2017,"['Kernel learning', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'Pattern classification', 'Optimization']",,"The kernel function plays a central role in modern pattern classification for its ability to capture the inherent affinity structure of the underlying data manifold. While the kernel function can be chosen by human experts with domain knowledge, it is often more principled and promising to learn it directly from data. This idea of kernel learning has been studied considerably in machine learning and pattern recognition. However, most kernel learning algorithms assume fully supervised setups requiring expensive class label annotation for the training data. In this paper we consider kernel learning in the semi-supervised setup where only a fraction of data points need to be labeled. We propose two approaches the first extends the idea of label propagation along the data similarity graph, in which we simultaneously learn the kernel and impute the labels of the unlabeled data. The second aims to minimize the dual loss in the support vector machines (SVM) classifier learning with respect to the kernel parameters and the missing labels. We provide reasonable and effective approximate solution methods for these optimization problems. These approaches exploit both labeled and unlabeled data in kernel leaning, where we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness on several benchmark datasets with partially labeled learning setups.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The fast learning time of the pattern classifier for large time series data is very useful in decision support systems. Considering the high interest in healthcare, including big data analysis, it is necessary to design a pattern classifier with a fast learning capability. We used large-scale time series data of 32 patients with sleep apnea (SA) for this study. The experiment was conducted by extending the parameter n, of the fuzzy membership function of FSVM, from 1 to 500. The result shows that the shortest learning time of FSVM is 3 s for radial base function (RBF), 17 s for a polynomial, and 35 s for a linear kernel, where the parameter n of the fuzzy membership function is n  2, n  433, and n  4, respectively.

Simultaneous Learning of Sentence Clustering and Class Prediction for Improved Document Classification,2017,"['Machine learning', 'Document classification', 'Sequence labeling', 'Term weighting']",,"In document classification it is common to represent a document as the so called bag-of-words form, which is essentially a global term distribution indicating how often certain terms appear in a text. Ignoring the spatial statistics (i.e., where in a text they appear) can potentially lead to a suboptimal solution. The key motivation or assumption in this paper is that there may exist underlying segmentation of sentences in a document, and perhaps this partitioning might be intuitively appealing (e.g., each group corresponds to a particular sentiment or gist of arguments). If the segmentation is known somehow, terms belonging to the samedifferent groups can potentially be treated in an equaldifferent manner for classification. Based on the idea, we build a novel document classification model comprised of two parts a sentence tagger that predicts the group labels of sentences, and a classifier that forms the input features as a weighted term frequency vector that is aggregated from all sentences but weighed differently cluster-wise according to the prediction in the first model. We suggest an efficient learning strategy for this model.

However, the support vector machine (SVM), which is applied to predict the RUL of Li-ion batteries, uses the traditional single-radial basis kernel function. This type of classifier has weak generalization ability, and it easily shows the problem of data migration, which results in inaccurate prediction of the RUL of Li-ion batteries.

The optimized coefficients of regression equations were derived using the gradient descent method as a learning method in Tensorflow which is the engine of machine-learning method. In South Korea, the variability of streamflow is relatively high, and rainfall is concentrated in summer that can significantly affect the characteristic analysis of pollutant loads. Thus, unlike the previous application of the LOADEST model (adjusting whole study period), the study period was classified into 5 flow conditions to estimate the optimized coefficients and regression equations in the LOADEST model. As shown in the results, the equation 9 which has 7 coefficients related to flow and seasonal characteristics was selected for each flow condition in the study watersheds. When compared the simulated load (SS) to observed load, the simulation showed a similar pattern to the observation for the high flow condition due to the flow parameters related to precipitation directly. On the other hand, although the simulated load showed a similar pattern to observation in several watersheds, most of study watersheds showed large differences for the low flow conditions. This is because the pollutant load during low flow conditions might be significantly affected by baseflow or point-source pollutant load. Thus, based on the results of this study, it can be found that to estimate the continuous pollutant load properly the regression equations need to be determined with proper coefficients based on various flow conditions in watersheds.

머신러닝을 이용한 빅데이터 품질진단 자동화에 관한 연구,2017,,,"In this study, I propose a method to automate the method to diagnose the quality of big data. The reason for automating the quality diagnosis of Big Data is that as the Fourth Industrial Revolution becomes a issue, there is a growing demand for more volumes of data to be generated and utilized.

If you make decisions or predictions from these low-quality data, then the results will also give you the wrong direction. To solve this problem, I have developed a model that can automate diagnosis for improving the quality of Big Data using machine learning which can quickly diagnose and improve the data. Machine learning is used to automate domain classification tasks to prevent errors that may occur during domain classification and reduce work time.

However, operational time for these methods should be short for detecting objects on quickly moving conveyor belts. To provide this characteristic, this algorithm for image processing is a region-based method. In this experiment, we counted young abalone shells that are similar in shape, size and color. We applied a characteristic conveyor system that operated in one direction. It obtained information on objects in the region of interest by comparing a second frame that continuously changed according to the information obtained with reference to objects in the first region. Objects were counted if the information between the first and second images matched. This count was exact when young shells were evenly spaced without overlap and missed objects were calculated using size information when objects moved without extra space.

However, in the future where machine learning AI will reach a considerable level, machine learning AI will afford a strong defense for the physician, and at that time real deliberation of legal responsibility to balance will rise. Partnership between machine learning AI and human professionals are becoming more and more reality in expectation of reduction of human error and cutting costs.

This comes from the finding that such similarities as simplicity, goal-directedness, and optimization exist between SEDs and algorithms. Thus, keywords scanned from the vast SED-oriented conversational patterns could be algorithmized by using deep learning. It can, then, be clustered to build data sets. The possible domains of such mental telepathy may encompass algorithms that provide examples of non-logical mental representation, algorithms that provide metaphorical examples and algorithms that provide conversation topics (Hwadu). This data group might show individually unique dialogue patterns inclusive of psychotherapy effectiveness.The current chatbot metrics rely on natural language processing within the established database system however, SED-specific algorithms reply with more creative keywords.

Using an automated text analysis method, all the news articles published from January 1, 1990 to November 15, 2016 in South Korea which included asbestos in the title and the body were collected by web scraping. Differences in topics were analyzed by structured topic modelling (STM) and compared by press companies and periods. More articles were found in liberal media outlets. Differences were found in the number and types of topics in the articles according to the partisanship and period. STM showed that the conservative press views asbestos as a personal problem, while the progressive press views asbestos as a social problem. A divergence in the perspective for emphasizing the issues of asbestos between the conservative press and progressive press was also found. Social perspective influences the main topics of news stories. Thus, the patients uneasiness and pain are not presented by both sources of media. In addition, topics differ between news media sources based on partisanship, and therefore cause divergence in readers framing.

ADMM is an approximation algorithm that solves complex original problems by dividing and combining the partial problems that are easier to optimize than original problems. It is useful for optimizing non-smooth or composite objective functions.

The proposed algorithm minimizes the memory and computation processing time by reducing the amount of computation processing and data required in the conventional deep learning structure in a general PC. The algorithm proposed in this paper consists of three steps a convolution layer configuration process using a random filter with discriminating power, a data reduction process using PCA, and a CNN structure creation using SVM. The learning process is not necessary in the convolution layer construction process using the discriminating random filter, thereby shortening the learning time of the overall deep learning. PCA reduces the amount of memory and computation throughput. The creation of the CNN structure using SVM maximizes the effect of reducing the amount of memory and computational throughput required.

NMT의 작동 과정에서 신경망이 학습하는 모범 번역은 인간이 투입한다. 그리고 정확한 원문의 입력도 중요한 요소가 된다. 기계번역을 통해 우수한 품질의 결과물을 생산하기 위해서는 번역자가 정확한 원문을 입력하고, 번역물을 수정할 수 있어야 한다. 특히 한영 번역의 경우 원문의 정확도는 번역물 품질에 주요 변수가 된다. 틀린 맞춤법이나 구문, 비문 등이 포함된 원천 텍스트를 입력하면 당연히 오류의 확률이 더 높아진다. 자연언어처리에서 원천 언어의 특징도 주요 변수가 된다. 예를 들면 원천 언어가 한국어인 경우, 조사의 사용이나 언어사용 환경에 따라 번역 오류가 발생할 수 있다.이런 상황을 고려해 볼 때 기계번역의 오류 유형을 제시하고, 원천 텍스트와의 관련성을 고찰하는 연구가 필요하고, 이는 인문학 분야에서 수행되는 것이 바람직하다. 원문의 검토가 사전 처리 과정이라면 기계번역의 결과물을 평가하고, 품질을 개선하는 방안을 제시하는 것은 후처리 과정이 된다.이 연구에서는 한영 기계번역에서 인간의 사전 처리와 후처리 문제를 살펴본다. 연구의 목적은 원천 텍스트의 정확도와 연계해서 오류를 항목별로 분석함으로써 기계번역의 오류 문제에 접근하는 방식을 제시하고 오류를 줄이는 방안을 논의하는 데 있다.","Over the past few years, the technology of machine translation has made remarkable progress from Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) to Neural Machine Translation (NMT). With the introduction of deep learning, the study of machine translation has been performed mainly in the field of computer engineering, which develops systems and algorithms for artificial intelligence. However, the quality and quantity of parallel corpus composed of human translation has a decisive influence on the quality of NMT. In the process of NMT, the model translation that neural network learns is input by human. Also, input of source text is an important factor. The translator must be able to input the correct original text and modify the translation to get excellent quality results in machine translation. Especially, in the case of Korean-English translation, the accuracy of the original text is the main variable for the translation quality. To reduce errors, the translator must enter the correct source text. Inputting source text that contains incorrect spelling, imprecise phrases, and non-grammatical sentences will, of course, increase the probability of error. In the natural language processing, the characteristics of the source language are also the main variables. For example, if the source language is Korean, translation errors may occur depending on the use of the postposition or contextual situation. Given this situation, the accuracy of the source text becomes a major factor in the quality of translation. While the review and revision of the original text is a preprocessing process, evaluating the results of the machine translation and suggesting ways to improve the quality is a postprocessing process.Considering this situation, it is necessary to study the relation between the source text and the error type of machine translation, and it is desirable to perform it in the field of humanities.In this study, we examine human preprocessing and postprocessing issues in Korean-English machine translation. The purpose of this study is to present the error problem of machine translation by analyzing the error in line with the accuracy of the source text, and discussing ways to reduce translation errors.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

There has been the merging of technology and arts for years however, unlike A.I, machines have not had creative art performance ability as human have, but have only been used as a mechanical method of arts.  A.I. field now is not only used as simple mechanical methods, but has also invaded the arts area that needs creativity which had been only for human distinction, and the controversy over creativity of A.I. is ongoing.   However, in the distinct fields of academic research, getting rid of the barrier between academic fields and converging the scientific technology of A.I and art creation activities so that through the collaboration between science and arts, their collective growth is promoted and a new paradigm in the art field is created will be of great significance.  This research intends to find out how creativity known as an exclusive human ability and area is connected to A.I. and what technics have developed A.I. in the creativity-demanded arts field. Moreover, this research aims to be used to shape new direction of artistic development as reviewing the characteristics of arts applied A.I. and to contribute towards the A.I. arts sphere under the unpredictable current situation. The research methods are composed of the following order.  First of all, the necessity and the purpose of the research based on research background is set and specific research methods is drawn.  Secondly, the research finds out the definition and history of A.I. and describes deep learning of the A.I. core technology based on big data.  Third, case study on the field of literature, music, and fine arts that actively develop A.I. technics among A.I. art fields are selected and then through a case analysis study of the convergence between A.I and art, the current situation of A.I. artistic creation described.  Fourth, characteristics of expression of A.I. based on case studies of A.I. artistic creation field is deducted.  With respect to the results, characteristics of expression of A.I. arts are creativity that creates new things that never existed based on learning data, pleasure that is felt through aesthetic works, convenience related to labour solutions during the creating process, and variability that changes from one to a total different work by simple technical operation or programming changes of new machine learning.  In conclusion, the creativity of current A.I. does not create new things but rather recreate existing work via machine learning from already given data. To sum up, for now, the field of artistic creation of A.I. cannot replace human ability like creation, instinct, judgement, etc. however, technical development of A.I. artistic creation is a big result to predict future possibility.  In the fourth industrial revolution in which IT (information Technology) quickly moves to DT (Date Technology), A.I. technical development will contribute to improve our quality of lives due to increasing service industry and labor values. It will also help to inspire new creation in the art field. This paper is expected to help the culture-art field that consistently needs A.I creativity.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

We forecast the very short-term wind power every 15 minutes starting two hours after receiving the most recent measurements up to 40 hours for a total of 38 hours, without using the NWP data but using the historical weather data. Generally, the NWP works as a predictor and can be converted to wind power forecasts through machine learning-based forecasting algorithms. Without the NWP, we can still build the predictor by shifting the historical weather data and apply the machine learning-based algorithms to the shifted weather data. In this process, the sampling intervals of the weather and wind power data are unified. To verify our approaches, we participated in the 2017 wind power forecasting competition held by the European Energy Market conference and ranked sixth.

Current fire detection methods such as smoke detector is very slow and unreliable because it usually uses chemical sensor based technology to detect fire particles. But by using vision sensor instead, fire can be proven to be detected much faster as we show in our experiments. Previous studies have applied various image processing and machine learning techniques to detect fire, but they usually don t work very well because these techniques require hand-crafted features that do not generalize well to various scenarios. But with the help of recent advancement in the field of deep learning, this research can be conducted to help solve this problem by using deep learning-based object detector that can detect fire using images from security camera. Deep learning based approach can learn features automatically so they can usually generalize well to various scenes. In order to ensure maximum capacity, we applied the latest technologies in the field of computer vision such as YOLO detector in order to solve this task. Considering the trade-off between recall vs. complexity, we introduced two convolutional neural networks with slightly different model s complexity to detect fire at different recall rate. Both models can detect fire at 99 average precision, but one model has 76 recall at 30 FPS while another has 61 recall at 50 FPS. We also compare our model memory consumption with each other and show our models robustness by testing on various real-world scenarios.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Among them, the frequency of examination using computed tomography(CT) has been increasing because of this techniques fast examination time and high diagnostic power. However, although the criteria for screening have been presented based on many previous studies on the CT exposure dose for adults, the criteria for children remain inadequate. Especially, relaxing the conditions to reduce the exposure dose of CT will lead to generation of noises. To address this problem, many noise removal algorithms have been developed. Among developed algorithms, a particularly strong interest has been focused on deep learning methods, which are a sort of artificial intelligence (AI)-based machine learning. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a noise removal algorithm using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), an AIbased deep learning method, and to apply the algorithm to pediatric abdominal CT so that to evaluate the usefulness of the approach. PMMA phantoms with different diameters of 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 cm, which can express pediatric abdomen, were manufactured and used. To evaluate dose and image quality, the tube current was fixed to 200 mAs and the tube voltage was changed from 80 to 120, and 140 kVp thereafter, the tube voltage was fixed to 120 kVp and the tube currents were changed from 50 to 100, 150, 200, and 250 mAs. According to the results, CTDIw showed a tendency to increase alongside with increases in the tube voltage and the tube currents, while noise decreased proportionally. In addition, the contrast decreased as the tube voltage increased, but was shown to be almost unrelated to the tube currents. Finally, the excellent CNRD result was measured in lowest exposure condition at 80 kVp and 50 mAs. Also, the average of CNRD with AI noise reduction algorithm was 1.6-4.2 times higher than before the application. In conclusion, the doses and characteristics of the pediatric abdominal CT scan according to various image acquisition conditions could be successfully identified and the efficiency of the AI noise removal algorithm developed in the present study was demonstrated.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Plurality Rulebased Density and Correlation Coefficientbased Clustering for K-NN,2017,"['Classification', 'Density-based', 'K-NN', 'DPC-KNN-PCA', 'Processing time']",,"k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) is a well-known classification algorithm, being feature spacebased on nearest-neighbor training examples in machine learning. However, K-NN, as we know, is a lazy learning method. Therefore, if a K-NNbased system very much depends on a huge amount of history data to achieve an accurate prediction result for a particular task, it gradually faces a processing-time performance-degradation problem. We have noticed that many researchers usually contemplate only classification accuracy. But estimation speed also plays an essential role in realtime prediction systems. To compensate for this weakness, this paper proposes correlation coefficientbased clustering (CCC) aimed at upgrading the performance of K-NN by leveraging processing-time speed and plurality rulebased density (PRD) to improve estimation accuracy. For experiments, we used real datasets (on breast cancer, breast tissue, heart, and the iris) from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. Moreover, real traffic data collected from Ojana Junction, Route 58, Okinawa, Japan, was also utilized to lay bare the efficiency of this method. By using these datasets, we proved better processing-time performance with the new approach by comparing it with classical K-NN.

Industry 4.0 in Germany and the EU,2017,"['Non-personal Data', 'Data Ownership', 'Property', 'Intellectual Property', 'Protection of Databases', 'Trade Secrets', 'Data as Infrastructure', 'Economics of Data']",,"In its core, Industry 4.0 refers to the change of production processes under conditions of adaptive intelligent production systems. Instead of being governed by a centrally controlled and in advance optimized process of production, the change aims at a continuous self-optimization of the process, which seems to be possible only through continuous generation and processing of information and its governance by artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning technologies.  The following presentation will focus on the emerging data economy. However, the debate on data and its adequate legal framework was dominated for a long time by the data protection issue related to personal data and constitutional questions of self-determination in times of ubiquitous data generation in a connected world. Industry 4.0 shifts the attention to machine generated, non-personal data, its role in the innovation process and an adequate regulatory framework between rights of exclusion and rights of access. This turns out to be an important political question in the EU and Germany and leads to the discussion of various concepts and instruments to ensure the free flow of data on the one side and the need for protection of machine-generated data on the other side.  Before I display the current framework and its applicability to data and data sets, I will outline some characteristics of data, because the concept of data is not well defined. Data are often understood as representing the real world or attributes or characteristics thereof and they are taken on its face value, treated as being neutral, objective, pre-analytic in nature and as conveying the information. This might be called a container approach. However, data are in fact framed technically, economically, ethically, temporally and so on. I follow the hypothesis, that data do not exist independently of the context they are generated and interpreted within. Therefore, it is more about relations between different data and data sets instead of following a container approach. This has a lot of consequences with regard to the question of data ownership, which is a hot topic of the current discussion. I will display in the following, that neither the law of property or intellectual property covers currently non-personal data as a subject of protection. In fact, the governance framework is mainly a contractual one, often accompanied by factual arrangement, which obviously are sufficient for most of the business actors. This is compatible with economic analysis of the problem. It might be a more productive approach to think about data as an infrastructure of the data driven economy which would bring rights to access data pools, standards of data, interoperability etc. to the fore.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Through the economic crises, bankruptcy have increased and bankruptcy prediction models have become more and more important. Therefore, corporate bankruptcy has been regarded as one of the major topics of research in business management. Also, many studies in the industry are in progress and important.  Previous studies attempted to utilize various methodologies to improve the bankruptcy prediction accuracy and to resolve the overfitting problem, such as Multivariate Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Generalized Linear Model (GLM). These methods are based on statistics. Recently, researchers have used machine learning methodologies such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Furthermore, fuzzy theory and genetic algorithms were used. Because of this change, many of bankruptcy models are developed. Also, performance has been improved.  In general, the companys financial and accounting information will change over time. Likewise, the market situation also changes, so there are many difficulties in predicting bankruptcy only with information at a certain point in time. However, even though traditional research has problems that dont take into account the time effect, dynamic model has not been studied much. When we ignore the time effect, we get the biased results. So the static model may not be suitable for predicting bankruptcy. Thus, using the dynamic model, there is a possibility that bankruptcy prediction model is improved.  In this paper, we propose RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) which is one of the deep learning methodologies. The RNN learns time series data and the performance is known to be good. Prior to experiment, we selected non-financial firms listed on the KOSPI, KOSDAQ and KONEX markets from 2010 to 2016 for the estimation of the bankruptcy prediction model and the comparison of forecasting performance. In order to prevent a mistake of predicting bankruptcy by using the financial information already reflected in the deterioration of the financial condition of the company, the financial information was collected with a lag of two years, and the default period was defined from January to December of the year. Then we defined the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy we defined is the abolition of the listing due to sluggish earnings. We confirmed abolition of the list at KIND that is corporate stock information website. Then we selected variables at previous papers. The first set of variables are Z-score variables. These variables have become traditional variables in predicting bankruptcy. The second set of variables are dynamic variable set. Finally we selected 240 normal companies and 226 bankrupt companies at the first variable set. Likewise, we selected 229 normal companies and 226 bankrupt companies at the second variable set.  We created a model that reflects dynamic changes in time-series financial data and by comparing the suggested model with the analysis of existing bankruptcy predictive models, we found that the suggested model could help to improve the accuracy of bankruptcy predictions. We used financial data in KIS Value (Financial database) and selected Multivariate Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Generalized Linear Model called logistic regression (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model as benchmark.   The result of the experiment proved that RNNs performance was better than comparative model. The accuracy of RNN was high in both sets of variables and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value was also high. Also when we saw the hit-ratio table, the ratio of RNNs that predicted a poor company to be bankrupt was higher than that of other comparative models. However the limitation of this paper is that an overfitting problem occurs during RNN learning.

We thus model the intention recognition problem as a text classification problem, and develop two techniques to improve a learning-based text classifier for the problem. The two techniques improve the classifier by location-based and area-based feature weightings, respectively. Experimental results show that, the two techniques can work together to significantly improve a Support Vector Machine classifier in both the recognition of HQ intentions and the retrieval of relevant HQs.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Color information is an important element in the traffic sign recognition system, as the performance depends on variations in weather conditions, illumination, and type of cameras used. Besides the above factors, traffic signs also differ across countries. To overcome these problems, our approach involves traffic sign detection, classification, and tracking. In the detection module, color enhancement with maximally stable extremal regions is performed to improve the extracting candidate regions of traffic signs. Support vector machine classifiers with distance to border and histogram of oriented gradient feature vectors are used to detect the traffic signs. Detected traffic signs are thereby classified using convolutional neural networks with fine-tuning. Additionally, Kalman filter-based multi-target tracking not only verifies traffic sign detection but also optimizes the detection of regions of interest.

K Nearest Neighbor Joins for Big Data Processing based on Spark,2017,['K-'],,"K Nearest Neighbor Join (KNN Join) is a simple yet effective method in machine learning. It is widely used in small dataset of the past time. As the number of data increases, it is infeasible to run this model on an actual application by a single machine due to memory and time restrictions. Nowadays a popular batch process model called MapReduce which can run on a cluster with a large number of computers is widely used for large-scale data processing. Hadoop is a framework to implement MapReduce, but its performance can be further improved by a new framework named Spark. In the present study, we will provide a KNN Join implement based on Spark. With the advantage of its in-memory calculation capability, it will be faster and more effective than Hadoop. In our experiments, we study the influence of different factors on running time and demonstrate robustness and efficiency of our approach.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Recently, many attempts have been made to predict the stock index using various machine learning methods including Deep Learning. Although the fundamental analysis and the technical analysis method are used for the analysis of the traditional stock investment transaction, the technical analysis method is more useful for the application of the short-term transaction prediction or statistical and mathematical techniques. Most of the studies that have been conducted using these technical indicators have studied the model of predicting stock prices by binary classification - rising or falling - of stock market fluctuations in the future market (usually next trading day). However, it is also true that this binary classification has many unfavorable aspects in predicting trends, identifying trading signals, or signaling portfolio rebalancing.  In this study, we try to predict the stock index by expanding the stock index trend (upward trend, boxed, downward trend) to the multiple classification system in the existing binary index method. In order to solve this multi-classification problem, a technique such as Multinomial Logistic Regression Analysis (MLOGIT), Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) we propose an optimization model using Genetic Algorithm as a wrapper for improving the performance of this model using Multi-classification Support Vector Machines (MSVM), which has proved to be superior in prediction performance. In particular, the proposed model named GA-MSVM is designed to maximize model performance by optimizing not only the kernel function parameters of MSVM, but also the optimal selection of input variables (feature selection) as well as instance selection. In order to verify the performance of the proposed model, we applied the proposed method to the real data. The results show that the proposed method is more effective than the conventional multivariate SVM, which has been known to show the best prediction performance up to now, as well as existing artificial intelligence  data mining techniques such as MDA, MLOGIT, CBR, and it is confirmed that the prediction performance is better than this. Especially, it has been confirmed that the instance selection plays a very important role in predicting the stock index trend, and it is confirmed that the improvement effect of the model is more important than other factors.  To verify the usefulness of GA-MSVM, we applied it to Koreas real KOSPI200 stock index trend forecast. Our research is primarily aimed at predicting trend segments to capture signal acquisition or short-term trend transition points. The experimental data set includes technical indicators such as the price and volatility index (2004  2017) and macroeconomic data (interest rate, exchange rate, SP 500, etc.) of KOSPI200 stock index in Korea. Using a variety of statistical methods including one-way ANOVA and stepwise MDA, 15 indicators were selected as candidate independent variables. The dependent variable, trend classification, was classified into three states 1 (upward trend), 0 (boxed), and -1 (downward trend). 70 of the total data for each class was used for training and the remaining 30 was used for verifying. To verify the performance of the proposed model, several comparative model experiments such as MDA, MLOGIT, CBR, ANN and MSVM were conducted. MSVM has adopted the One-Against-One (OAO) approach, which is known as the most accurate approach among the various MSVM approaches. Although there are some limitations, the final experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, GA-MSVM, performs at a significantly higher level than all comparative models.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The CVE registered from 2010 to 2015 numbered about 80,000, and it is expected that more vulnerabilities will be reported. In most cases, patching a vulnerability depends on the developers capability, and most patching techniques are based on manual analysis, which requires nine months, on average. The techniques are composed of finding the vulnerability, conducting the analysis based on the source code, and writing new code for the patch. Zero-day is critical because the time gap between the first discovery and taking action is too long, as mentioned. To solve the problem, techniques for automatically detecting and analyzing software (SW) vulnerabilities have been proposed recently.

E-MICE Energy-Efficient Concurrent Exploitation of Multiple Wi-Fi Radios,2017,,,"PThe concurrent use of multiple Wi-Fi radios in individual frequency channels is a solution readily available today to the increase of a mobile stations communication capacity, but at the expense of occasional performance deterioration (when the heterogeneity of capacity between interfaces gets severe) and additional power consumption. This paper proposes a mobile-side solution for the concurrent use of multiple radios in a performance-aware and energy-efficient manner, with which a mobile station activates and deactivates radio interfaces dynamically according to traffic demands and a predicted capacity gain. To this end, the proposed solution is composed of multiple prediction algorithms and a control algorithm. Prediction when activating an additional radio interface is relatively difficult since no information of the disabled interfaces current status (and the corresponding frequency channels) is available at the time of prediction. Our experiments show that, despite different types and used channels, different radio interfaces have a strong correlation of received signal strengths and used PHY rates between them. Based on this observation, the proposed solution learns a correlation pattern between interfaces whenever multiple interfaces are active and makes prediction of the coverage, expected PHY rate and capacity impact of an inactive interface based on the learned correlation with a currently active interface. The design of the prediction algorithms are based on a simple or machine-learning technique (SVM). The control algorithm then keeps monitoring the utilization of active interfaces and, if any of them has utilization over a threshold, checks if each inactive interface is within coverage and a valid rate range based on an active interfaces received signal strength. Finally, an action of a configuration change (either activation, deactivation, or no change) selected based on the prediction of the resulting capacity is applied. Testbed experiments using COTS dual-band Wi-Fi interfaces demonstrate that the solution can enhance throughput by up to 29.6 percent (in a close distance to AP) and at most halve power consumption compared to legacy aggregation while the gain varies depending on the location and traffic conditions.P",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The graph-based method has the advantage of constructing a semantic graph that delineates all paths between different senses that an ambiguous word may have. However, unnecessary semantic paths may be introduced, thereby increasing the risk of errors. To solve this problem and construct a fine-grained graph, in this paper, we propose a model that iteratively constructs the graph while eliminating unnecessary nodes and edges, i.e., senses and semantic paths.

For this, I will suggest four approaches when it comes to establishing an ethics for the AMA. First, the top-down approach makes use of the traditional ethical theories such as utilitarian or deontological theories. The role of the ethical theory in this approach is to provide the AMA with rules to follow in morally complex situations. Second, the bottom-up approach follows the central ideas proposed by developing various machine-learning methods for the AMA to learn ethical reasoning without giving it any available rules at hand. The basic idea for this approach is to regard the AMA as a human child who has the potential of obtaining moral reasoning as the child grows up according to proper developmental stages of morality.

Previous studies have mainly analyzed young drivers aggressive driving tendency, yet they were only done through pure clustering or classification technique of machine learning. However, since elderly people have different driving habits due to their fragile physical conditions, it is necessary to develop a new method such as enhancing the characteristics of driving data to properly analyze aggressive driving of elderly drivers. In this study, acceleration data collected from a smartphone of a driving vehicle is analyzed by a newly proposed ECA(Enhanced Clustering method for Acceleration data) technique, coupled with a conventional clustering technique (K-means Clustering, Expectation-maximization algorithm). ECA selects high-intensity data among the data of the cluster group detected through K-means and EM in all of the subjects data and models the characteristic data through the scaled value. Using this method, the aggressive driving data of all youth and elderly experiment participants were collected, unlike the pure clustering method. We further found that the K-means clustering has higher detection efficiency than EM method. Also, the results of K-means clustering demonstrate that a young driver has a driving strength 1.29 times higher than that of an elderly driver. In conclusion, the proposed method of our research is able to detect aggressive driving maneuvers from data of the elderly having low operating intensity. The proposed method is able to construct a customized safe driving system for the elderly driver. In the future, it will be possible to detect abnormal driving conditions and to use the collected data for early warning to drivers.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The limits of linearity problem existing in financial time series studies are overcome by using machine learning theory such as artificial intelligence prediction model. The study of quantitative financial data based on the past stock market-related numerical data is widely performed using artificial intelligence to forecast future movements of stock price or indices. Various other studies have been conducted to predict the future direction of the market or the stock price of companies by learning based on a large amount of text data such as various news and comments related to the stock market.  Investing on commodity asset, one of alternative assets, is usually used for enhancing the stability and safety of traditional stock and bond asset portfolio. There are relatively few researches on the investment model about commodity asset than mainstream assets like equity and bond.

The four major commodity indices are Goldman Sachs Commodity Index(GSCI), Dow Jones UBS Commodity Index(DJUI), Thomson ReutersCore Commodity CRB Index(TRCI), and Rogers International Commodity Index(RI). We selected each two individual futures among three sectors as energy, agriculture, and metals that are actively traded on CME market and have enough liquidity. They are Crude Oil, Natural Gas, Corn, Wheat, Gold and Silver Futures. We made the equally weighted portfolio with six commodity futures for comparing with other commodity indices.  We set the 19 macroeconomic indicators including stock market indices, exports  imports trade data, labor market data, and composite leading indicators as the input data of the model because commodity asset is very closely related with the macroeconomic activities. They are 14 US economic indicators, two Chinese economic indicators and two Korean economic indicators. Data period is from January 1990 to May 2017. We set the former 195 monthly data as training data and the latter 125 monthly data as test data.  In this study, we verified that the performance of the equally weighted commodity futures portfolio rebalanced by the SVM model is better than that of other commodity indices. The prediction accuracy of the model for the commodity indices does not exceed 50 regardless of the SVM kernel function.

The deep learning technique is already being applied to many problems. Especially, it shows good performance in image recognition field. In addition, it shows good performance in high dimensional data area such as voice, image and natural language, which was difficult to get good performance using existing machine learning techniques. However, in contrast, it is difficult to find deep leaning researches on traditional business data and structured data analysis. In this study, we tried to find out whether the deep learning techniques have been studied so far can be used not only for the recognition of high dimensional data but also for the binary classification problem of traditional business data analysis such as customer churn analysis, marketing response prediction, and default prediction. And we compare the performance of the deep learning techniques with that of traditional artificial neural network models.  The experimental data in the paper is the telemarketing response data of a bank in Portugal. It has input variables such as age, occupation, loan status, and the number of previous telemarketing and has a binary target variable that records whether the customer intends to open an account or not. In this study, to evaluate the possibility of utilization of deep learning algorithms and techniques in binary classification problem, we compared the performance of various models using CNN, LSTM algorithm and dropout, which are widely used algorithms and techniques in deep learning, with that of MLP models which is a traditional artificial neural network model. However, since all the network design alternatives can not be tested due to the nature of the artificial neural network, the experiment was conducted based on restricted settings on the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the number of output data (filters), and the application conditions of the dropout technique. The F1 Score was used to evaluate the performance of models to show how well the models work to classify the interesting class instead of the overall accuracy.  The detail methods for applying each deep learning technique in the experiment is as follows. The CNN algorithm is a method that reads adjacent values from a specific value and recognizes the features, but it does not matter how close the distance of each business data field is because each field is usually independent. In this experiment, we set the filter size of the CNN algorithm as the number of fields to learn the whole characteristics of the data at once, and added a hidden layer to make decision based on the additional features. For the model having two LSTM layers, the input direction of the second layer is put in reversed position with first layer in order to reduce the influence from the position of each field. In the case of the dropout technique, we set the neurons to disappear with a probability of 0.5 for each hidden layer.  The experimental results show that the predicted model with the highest F1 score was the CNN model using the dropout technique, and the next best model was the MLP model with two hidden layers using the dropout technique.

Especially, machine learning is leading the destructive innovation in the field of law as the artificial intelligence becomes popular. There are also concerns that artificial intelligence may be mentioned as a singular phenomenon that transcends human intelligence, that many jobs are lost due to artificial intelligence, or that artificial intelligence is a threat to the survival of mankind. However, it is easy to overlook the fact that artificial intelligence is already operating in reality, and that artificial intelligence, in particular, plays a role in human decision-making. US police have long been engaged in crime prevention activities using artificial intelligence-based crime prediction techniques and have achieved considerable achievements such as reduced crime rates. In the judiciary, for example, probation, bail, and even judgment, models to predict recidivism is widely used. Although it is thought that decision making such as prediction by artificial intelligence will be free from objectivity and prejudice unlike human decision which is influenced by subjectivity, it is surprisingly revealed that decision making by artificial intelligence is biased and particularly discriminatory. The biased nature of decision making by artificial intelligence and its discriminatory results are likely to undermine the social value of prohibiting discrimination. Therefore, the countermeasures against various problems of decision making by artificial intelligence such as biased problems include not only posterior discipline that corrects differential results, but also generation of differential results in the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of artificial intelligence decision tools. There is also a great need for pre-regulation to block in advance.Especially in the public domain, such as legal decision making by artificial intelligence algorithms, there is a need for a different approach to individual remediation in the private domain, where decision making has a wide range of influences. Rather than seeking redress, it seems effective to block the source of the algorithm elements that can bring discriminative effects in the decision making process. Among these precautionary measures, legality control through prior control of the development process and approval of use is a priority. It is necessary to introduce the concept of ethical design to the pre-control of the development process. It must be ensured that the artificial intelligence algorithm operates in accordance with the ethical standards beyond the merit of being operated by the designers intention. Furthermore, before using artificial intelligence algorithms, it is necessary to perform static analysis, which is an algorithm code oriented analysis, and dynamic analysis, which examines the operation process of an actual algorithm. Furthermore, when artificial intelligence algorithms are used, there is a problem that automation of decisions is made so that no one is responsible for the risks or mistakes caused by decisions. Therefore, human intervention in the decision-making process is necessary in order to provide normative grounds for legal decision making and to clarify the responsible party. In addition to these pre-regulations, the resolution of the opacity of artificial intelligence algorithms should also be included in the larger picture of the discipline.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

However, unlike computers that process and analyze the entire data collected, humans process the data in a summarized pattern. In other words, humans make the best decisions through summarized information rather than whole data. By managing only summarized information, you can build a more efficient system in terms of time and cost. In particular, there is a need for learning from data based on summarized information for processing and analyzing large amounts of data for artificial intelligence learning in a big data environment.

Here in the Gaussian process modeling stage, Gaussian process-based dynamic modeling and automatic kernel search were utilized. In Gaussian process-based dynamic modeling, the latent state vector performs the role of the index, while in the automatic kernel search, time plays the index role.

We apply the SVR model to the nonstationary monthly SPI (standardized precipitation index) time series data which is one of the measures of drought. We consider two different data types to build SVR model. First, we do not consider the past time-lag. Second, we consider the reasonable amount of past time-lags. The data of considering past time-lags are 4 type, these are 3, 6, 9 and 12 months as the independent variable. Totally, we define 5 types of data sets. Therefore, in this study, SVR model according to 5 types of data was applied, and also SVR model with seasonality was applied after identify the seasonal factors of precipitation. In conclusion, it is more accurate to consider the past time-lag in all SVR models. Among the data considering the past time-lag, the data considering the past 6 months shows the best performance. However, the difference between the SVR model without seasonality and with seasonality is not significant.

Materials and Methods To calculate of detector positions for a source localizing RPM system optimization problem is defined. To solve the problem, a modified iterative genetic algorithm (MIGA) is developed. In general, a genetic algorithm (GA) finds a globally optimal solution with a high probability, but it is not perfect at all times. To increase the probability to find globally optimal solution rather, a MIGA is designed by supplementing the iteration, competition, and verification with GA. For an optimization problem that is defined to find detector positions that maximizes differences of detector signals, a localization method is derived by modifying the inverse radiation transport model, and realistic parameter information is suggested. Results and Discussion To compare the MIGA and GA, both algorithms are implemented in a MATLAB environment. The performance of the GA and MIGA and that of the procedures supplemented in the MIGA are analyzed by computer simulations. The results show that the iteration, competition, and verification procedures help to search for globally optimal solutions. Further, the MIGA is more robust against falling into local minima and finds a more reliably optimal result than the GA. Conclusion The positions of the detectors on an RPM for radioactive source localization are optimized using the MIGA. To increase the contrast of the measurements from each detector, a relationship between the source and the detectors is derived by modifying the inverse transport model. Realistic parameters are utilized for accurate simulations. Furthermore, the MIGA is developed to achieve a reliable solution.

In document classification, it is assumed that a new input data can be classified into any of the categories observed in the training data. Therefore, if a new input data belongs to an unobserved category which does not exist in the training data, then such data cannot be classified exactly. To solve the above problem, Arakawa et al. proposed the method which models the generative probabilities of documents with a mixture of Polya distributions and estimates the optimum category within all observed and unobserved categories where it is assumed that documents in each category are generated from each single Polya distribution. However, the statistical characteristics of document categories are generally more complicated and there are various underlying latent topics in a category. Because a single Polya distribution models each category in the conventional approach, this method cannot represent the variation of word frequency depending on plural unobserved latent topics.

Through previous researches to English language, we found dependency information of words has been one of important features in hedge classification, but not used in Korean researches. Additionally, we found that word embedding vectors include the word usage information. We assume that the word usage information could somehow represent the dependency information. Therefore, we utilized word embedding and neural networks in hedge sentence classification. We used more than one and half million sentences as word embedding dataset and also manually constructed 12,517-sentence hedge classification dataset obtained from online news. We used SVM and CRF as our baseline systems and the proposed system outperformed SVM by 7.2p and also CRF by 1.2p.

At this time, the positions of the own ship and the opponent ship are used for identification and prediction of the future situation, and the action is selected based on this information. Here, the person in charge predicts the position of itself and the opposing ship, and the calculated positions are called Dead Reckoning Position (DRP). In the existing DRP calculation, the position of the ship is predicted based on the current position, speed and course, so it cannot be applied in all navigation situations. For this reason, both the vessel and the VTS center utilize the navigation intentions of the two vessels related to the traffic situation for their own decision-making. In this study, we intend to predict the ships position based on the route extraction method proposed in the SVR seaway model. We predict the future speed, and propose a method of predicting the position applied to the SVR seaway model. For the verification of the proposed DRP calculation, a virtual path and ships trajectories which are similar to the actual navigation environment were constructed. As a result, comparison data between the existing DRP and proposed DRP are presented. And enhanced closest point of approach calculation results are presented for two approaching ships as a time series.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is different from conventional machines in that it is able to learn and do cognitive reasoning based on deep learning techniques. Although AI technology differs in terms of creativity, availability, and diversity according to the stage of development, AI is creating creativity as a non-human subject in various fields such as music, art, game, design, novel and newspaper article. AI creation lies in the blind spot of protection of existing intellectual property rights in that human beings are not directly involved in creation, and the demand for a new protection system is increasing. Discussions on the copyright protection of AI creations arecentered on Japan and the EU. In particular, the Japan Intellectual Property Strategy Headquarters issued the Artificial Intelligence Report on April 8, 2016.This paper focuses on the AI report of Japan and presents a new approach for copyright protection of AI creation. First of all, the development of AI technology is expected to produce a large number of various creative works in the future. If an exclusive right is given, it is worried about side effects due to intensification of monopolization. On the other hand, the need for copyright protection to induce investment in AI is increasing, and a harmonious approach to the pros and cons is needed. This paper argues that a very low level of protection is valid even when protecting the return on investment in existing AI industries. For example, applying Thin copyright protection theory to AI creations, the striking similarity rather than substantial similarity as a component of infringement is defined as a requirement. It is suggested that criminal punishment should be excluded even in relief. In addition, to distinguish between AI creations and humans, it is necessary to consider the introduction of new registration and labeling systems. This paper also argues that it is appropriate to set the protection period to a short term of about 5 years.Furthermore, even if it is an infringement, it is suggested to consider the possibility of using permission based on the payment of compensation rather than the prohibition of the use.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Fall Detection System for the Elderly Based on the Classification of Shimmer Sensor Prototype Data,2017,"['Aged Humans', 'Computer Communication Network', 'Accidental Fall Detection', 'Information Systems', 'Shimmer', 'Wireless Technology', 'Machine Learning']",,"Objectives Falling in the elderly is considered a major cause of death. In recent years, ambient and wireless sensor platforms have been extensively used in developed countries for the detection of falls in the elderly. However, we believe extra efforts are required to address this issue in developing countries, such as Pakistan, where most deaths due to falls are not even reported.Considering this, in this paper, we propose a fall detection system prototype that s based on the classification on real time shimmer sensor data. Methods We first developed a data set, SMotion of certain postures that could lead to falls in the elderly by using a body area network of Shimmer sensors and categorized the items in this data set into age and weight groups.We developed a feature selection and classification system using three classifiers, namely, support vector machine (SVM), Knearest neighbor (KNN), and neural network (NN). Finally, a prototype was fabricated to generate alerts to caregivers, health experts, or emergency services in case of fall. Results To evaluate the proposed system, SVM, KNN, and NN were used. The results of this study identified KNN as the most accurate classifier with maximum accuracy of 96 for age groups and 93 for weight groups. Conclusions In this paper, a classification-based fall detection system is proposed. For this purpose, the SMotion data set was developed and categorized into two groups (age and weight groups). The proposed fall detection system for the elderly is implemented through a body area sensor network using third-generation sensors. The evaluation results demonstrate the reasonable performance of the proposed fall detection prototype system in the tested scenarios.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The proposed algorithm leads to high accuracy at minimum cost to predict fault location and fault type classification.

Then, the fault signal is decomposed by using discrete wavelet transform. Statistical sampling is used to extract appropriate fault features as benchmark of decomposed signal to train classifier. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to illustrate the performance of statistical sampling performance. The overall time of sampling is not exceeding 1 cycles, taking into account the interval time. The proposed method takes two steps of sampling. The first step takes  cycle of during-fault and the second step takes  cycle of post fault impedance. The interval time between the two steps is assumed to be  cycle. Extensive studies using MATLAB software show accurate fault location estimation and fault type classification of the proposed method.

뉴럴 디코딩의 원리와 최신 연구 동향 소개,2017,"['neural decoding', 'spike trains', 'rate decoding', 'temporal decoding', 'population decoding', 'information theory', 'and machine-learning']",,"The neural decoding is a procedure that uses spike trains fired by neurons to estimate features of original stimulus. This is a fundamental step for understanding how neurons talk each other and, ultimately, how brains manage information. In this paper, the strategies of neural decoding are classified into three methodologies rate decoding, temporal decoding, and population decoding, which are explained. Rate decoding is the firstly used and simplest decoding method in which the stimulus is reconstructed from the numbers of the spike at given time (e. g. spike rates). Since spike number is a discrete number, the spike rate itself is often not continuous and quantized, therefore if the stimulus is not static and simple, rate decoding may not provide good estimation for stimulus. Temporal decoding is the decoding method in which stimulus is reconstructed from the timing information when the spike fires. It can be useful even for rapidly changing stimulus, and our sensory system is believed to have temporal rather than rate decoding strategy. Since the use of large numbers of neurons is one of the operating principles of most nervous systems, population decoding has advantages such as reduction of uncertainty due to neuronal variability and the ability to represent a stimulus attributes simultaneously. Here, in this paper, three different decoding methods are introduced, how the information theory can be used in the neural decoding area is also given, and at the last machinelearning based algorithms for neural decoding are introduced.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Dual-kNN for a Pattern Classification Approach,2017,"['Dual-kNN', 'kNN', 'Robustness', 'Pattern classification']",,"Classification is a process of discovering and categorizing objects from large data storage that have similar characteristics, properties, and patterns. One of the most widely used classification methods in machine learning is the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The unique property of k-NN that appeals to researchers is its simplicity, so it can be applied successfully over a wide field. However, according to measurement of the performance of an algorithm based on three considerations (simplicity, processing time, and prediction power), the k-NN algorithm lacks highspeed computation and maintenance of high accuracy for different K values. In other words, k-NN is a heuristic classification approach. Besides, the prediction accuracy fades away whenever K approaches larger values. To overcome these issues, this paper presents a dual-kNN that concentrates on two properties to keep up the accuracy at different K values and upgrade processing time performance. By conducting experiments on real datasets and comparing this algorithm with k-NN, it was also confirmed that the new dual-kNN is an effective and robust approach to classification.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Sijo as a function of healing forms emotional codes of therapy, which is the total of emotions, through the fusion of emotions formed during the process of appreciation of various works. This process enables the literary therapeutic activities to proceed physiologically in the human body. Just as machine learning is self-learning by cognitive functions, the coding process for encoding and re-encoding at all times operates on collections of numerous neurons in the human system. In such a process, it is predicted that amino acids are synthesized in the human body by collective encoding of emotion codes. These amino acids regulate the signaling system of the human body. In the future, if the study on the healing process as such at the contact point of humanities and human physiology proceeds, it is expected that a program of higher quality humanistic therapy will be activated.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

ACO-based clustering for Ego Network analysis,2017,"['Social networks analysis', 'Ego Networks', 'Clustering', 'ACO algorithm']",,"PThe unstoppable growth of Social Networks (SNs), and the huge number of connected users, have become these networks as one of the most popular and successful domains for a large number of research areas. The different possibilities, volume and variety that these SNs offer, has become them an essential tool for every-day working and social relationships. One of the basic features that any SN provides is to allow users to group, organize and classify their connections into different groups, or circles. These circles can be defined using different characteristics as roommates, workmates, hobbies, professional skills, etc. The problem of finding these circles taking into account the variety, volume and dynamics of these SNs has become an important challenge for a wide number of Computer Science areas, as Big Data, Data Mining or Machine Learning among others. Problems related to pre-processing, fusion and knowledge discovering of information from these sources are still an open question. This paper presents a new Bioinspired method, based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms, that has been designed to find and analyze these circles. Given any user in a network, the new method is able to automatically determine the different users that compose hisher groups or circles of interest, so the network will be clustered into different components based on the users profiles and their dynamics. This algorithm has been applied to Ego Networks where the node centering the network (called Ego) represents the user being studied. In this work two different ACO algorithms, that differ in the source of information used to perform the community finding tasks, have been designed. The first ACO algorithm uses the information extracted from the topology of the network, whereas the second one uses the profile information provided by users. The proposed algorithms are able to detect the different circles in three popular Social Networks Facebook, Twitter and Google. Finally, and using several databases from previous SNs, an experimental evaluation of our methods has been carried out to show how the algorithms are currently working. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Biological function integrated prediction of severe radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis a nested case control study,2017,"['Rheumatoid arthritis', 'Radiographic progression', 'Bioinformatic analysis', 'GWAS', 'Post-GWAS analysis']",,"PBBackgroundBPPRadiographic progression is reported to be highly heritable in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, previous study using genetic loci showed an insufficient accuracy of prediction for radiographic progression. The aim of this study is to identify a biologically relevant prediction model of radiographic progression in patients with RA using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) combined with bioinformatics analysis.PPBMethodsBPPWe obtained genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 374 Korean patients with RA using Illumina HumanOmni2.5Exome-8 arrays. Radiographic progression was measured using the yearly Sharpvan der Heijde modified score rate, and categorized in no or severe progression. Significant SNPs for severe radiographic progression from GWAS were mapped on the functional genes and reprioritized by post-GWAS analysis. For robust prediction of radiographic progression, tenfold cross-validation using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was conducted. Accuracy was used for selection of optimal SNPs set in the Hanyang Bae RA cohort. The performance of our final model was compared with that of other models based on GWAS results and SPOT (one of the post-GWAS analyses) using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The reliability of our model was confirmed using GWAS data of Caucasian patients with RA.PPBResultsBPPA total of 36,091 significant SNPs with a IpI value 0.05 from GWAS were reprioritized using post-GWAS analysis and approximately 2700 were identified as SNPs related to RA biological features. The best average accuracy of ten groups was 0.6015 with 85 SNPs, and this increased to 0.7481 when combined with clinical information.

Transport modelling in the age of big data,2017,,,"New Big Data sources such as mobile phone call data records, smart card data and geo-coded social media records allow to observe and understand mobility behaviour on an unprecedented level of detail. Despite the availability of such new Big Data sources, transport demand models used in planning practice still, almost exclusively, are based on conventional data such as travel diary surveys and population census. This literature review brings together recent advances in harnessing Big Data sources to understand travel behaviour and inform travel demand models that allow transport planners to compute what-if scenarios. From trip identification to activity inference, we review and analyse the existing data-mining methods that enable these opportunistically collected mobility traces inform transport demand models. We identify that future research should tap on the potential of probabilistic models and machine learning techniques as commonly used in data science. Those data-mining approaches are designed to handle the uncertainty of sparse and noisy data as it is the case for mobility traces derived from mobile phone data. In addition, they are suitable to integrate different related data sets in a data fusion scheme so as to enrich Big Data with information from travel diaries. In any case, we also acknowledge that sophisticated modelling knowledge has developed in the domain of transport planning and therefore we strongly advise that still, domain expert knowledge should build the fundament when applying data-driven approaches in transport planning.

Although Changsagihaeng and recent translation of Japanese materials improved the accessibility to the references, related researches are still lacking. To broaden our horizons for the research of Susinsa, therefore, we investigated the Koukanhitsukei which contains most of data from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The Koukanhitsukei consists of 18 books and were published by Sakada Morodo of the Japanese ministry of foreign affairs to assist Miyamoto Kouichi for his task in Chosun after return of Susinsa. In these references, not only fragmentary events such as participating in magic banquet and physicians visiting from Juntendo for a sick envoy member, but also detailed stories such as the painter Kim Yong-wons purchase of machines and chemicals (zinc and hydrochloric acid) and Park Young-suns learning of vaccination from Juntendo were contained, which were not included in the record of diplomatic journey of Chosun. Such a positive attitude toward modern civilization has been hard to find in the records by Kim Ki-su or his personal assistant Ahn Gwang-mook.  We can also figure out the Japanese viewpoint on the Susinsa by Koukanhitsukei. Japanese in the meiji era had an antipathy to the arrogant attitude of Chosuns Tongsinsa and attempted to impair the relation between two countries. They regarded Chosun as an uncivilized country clinging to old customs and had a perception that they must civilize people of Chosun. Consequently, though there was no practical outcomes, they tried to let the first Susinsa enlarge the knowledge about multiple government organizations, and the products of civilization.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

However, the attenu-ation and the harsh environment of the power line communicationchannels, makes it difficult to establish a reliable communicationbetween two nodes of the network which are separated by a longdistance. Relaying and cooperative communication has been usedto overcome this problem. In this paper a two-hop cooperative PLChas been studied, where the data is communicated between a trans-mitter and a receiver node, through a single array node which hasto be selected from a set of available arrays. The relay selectionproblemcan be solved by having channel state information (CSI) attransmitter and selecting the relay which results in the best perfor-mance. However, acquiring the channel state information at trans-mitter increases the complexity of the communication system andintroduces undesired overhead to the system. We propose a classof machine learning schemes, namely multi-armed bandit (MAB),to solve the relay selection problem without the knowledge of thechannel at the transmitter.

The performance of HSA is validated using Iris, Wine, Glass, and Vowel UCI machine learning repository datasets comparing to previous studies by experiment and analysis. Our proposed KSAK (K-meansSAK-means) and SAK (SAK-means) are better than KSA(K-meansSA), SA, and K-means in our simulations.

토픽 모델링에 기반한 온라인 상품 평점 예측을 위한 온라인 사용 후기 분석,2017,"['LDA', 'Artificial Neural Network', 'Topic Modeling', 'Rating Prediction', 'Review Analysis']",,"Customers have been affected by others opinions when they make a purchase. Thanks to the development of technologies, people are sharing their experiences such as reviews or ratings through online or social network services, However, although ratings are intuitive information for others, many reviews include only texts without ratings. Also, because of huge amount of reviews, customers and companies cant read all of them so they are hard to evaluate to a product without ratings. Therefore, in this study, we propose a methodology to predict ratings based on reviews for a product. In a methodology, we first estimate the topic-review matrix using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation technic which is widely used in topic modeling. Next, we predict ratings based on the topic-review matrix using the artificial neural network model which is based on the backpropagation algorithm. Through experiments with actual reviews, we find that our methodology can predict ratings based on customers reviews. And our methodology performs better with reviews which include certain opinions. As a result, our study can be used for customers and companies that want to know exactly a product with ratings. Moreover, we hope that our study leads to the implementation of future studies that combine machine learning and topic modeling.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Applying of Decision Tree Analysis to Risk Factors Associated with Pressure Ulcers in Long-Term Care Facilities,2017,"['Data Mining', 'Decision Trees', 'Long-Term Care', 'Pressure Ulcer', 'Risk Factors']",,"PBObjectivesBPPThe purpose of this study was to use decision tree analysis to explore the factors associated with pressure ulcers (PUs) among elderly people admitted to Korean long-term care facilities.PPBMethodsBPPThe data were extracted from the 2014 National Inpatient Sample (NIS)data of Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA). A MapReduce-based program was implemented to join and filter 5 tables of the NIS. The outcome predicted by the decision tree model was the prevalence of PUs as defined by the Korean Standard Classification of Disease-7 (KCD-7 code L89SUPSUP). Using R 3.3.1, a decision tree was generated with the finalized 15,856 cases and 830 variables.PPBResultsBPPThe decision tree displayed 15 subgroups with 8 variables showing 0.804 accuracy, 0.820 sensitivity, and 0.787 specificity. The most significant primary predictor of PUs was length of stay less than 0.5 day. Other predictors were the presence of an infectious wound dressing, followed by having diagnoses numbering less than 3.5 and the presence of a simple dressing. Among diagnoses, injuries to the hip and thigh was the top predictor ranking 5th overall. Total hospital cost exceeding 2,200,000 Korean won (US 2,000) rounded out the top 7.PPBConclusionsBPPThese results support previous studies that showed length of stay, comorbidity, and total hospital cost were associated with PUs. Moreover, wound dressings were commonly used to treat PUs. They also show that machine learning, such as a decision tree, could effectively predict PUs using big data.P",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Among renewable energy, wind energy source is important as energy role by converting wind power into electric power using wind turbine. The reason for emphasizing the importance of wind energy forecasting affects that when the wind turbine becomes a central supplydemand generator in the power system, the maintenance of the generator, the stoppage of the generator stoppage, the economic dispatch, the power supply plan (generator, transmission line, etc.). Therefore, this paper uses power generation, wind direction, wind speed, and power generation variation as multi-variables to predict the short-term wind power generation of an efficient wind power generator. In this case, four models are generated through multi-variate combination using multi-variate correlation. And SVR, which is a machine learning method, is used to select the best model among the four models. To verify the model, we estimate the power generation using data at three wind farms (A, B, C) in Jeju Island. Experimental results show that the model using power generation, wind direction and wind speed has a smaller prediction error than other models in predicting short-term wind power generation. Therefore, the most important variables in predicting short-term wind power generation are generation amount, wind direction and wind speed.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Spark provides an environment that can process large amount of data in main memory using the concept of abstract objects called RDD. Spark provides Mllib, a dedicated library for machine learning, but Mllib only includes k-means that can process only continuous data, so there is a limitation that categorical data processing is impossible.

However, illegal advertising spam messages exploit people because they can be used without the need for friend registration. Recently, spam message filtering systems that use machine learning have been developed, but they have some disadvantages such as requiring many calculations. In this paper, we implemented a spam message filtering system using the set-based POI search algorithm and sentence similarity without servers. This algorithm can judge whether the input query is a spam message or not using only letter composition without any server computing. Therefore, we can filter the spam message although the input text message has been intentionally modified. We added a specific preprocessing option which aims to enable spam filtering. Based on the experimental results, we observe that our spam message filtering system shows better performance than the original set-based POI search algorithm.

The revolution occurring in these technologies is expected to increase productivity and longevity, for which all mortal humans have been longing. However, at the same time, the revolution has the potential to shake the foundation of present social structures and the ideas about what it means to be human.  Already in the Third Industrial Revolution. there has been a thinning of the middle class. As society became more bipolarized, society has more haves and have-nots, with fewer in between, which in turn has led to an increase in social tensions. The Fourth Industrial Revolution might yield greater inequality, particularly in its potential to disrupt labor markets. As automation substitutes labor across the economy, the displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns on capital and returns on labor. This means a collapse to the internal structure of the labor-based society.  Under these circumstances, to prepare for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is necessary to introduce the general welfare system. Society must bear the expenses of housing, education, and medical services. Basic income systems must also be introduced to support the expenses of other areas.  Specific advances in biomedical technologies, which are capable of changing the nature of the human species, require us to take risks and responsibilities for their application such as hacking medical devices, privacy and confidentiality of medical records, and biological inequalities depending on social class. The government must restrict intellectual property rights or industrial copyrights for the products of biomedical technologies, which are not only easily embedded in the human body but also bound to have widespread social ramifications, in order to decelerate the speed of technical development. In the case of these products, which have the potential to manipulation human genetic structure, technological citizenship must be secured. Moreover, any studies in these technologies must be strictly progressed according to international standards established by the International Biomedical Science Agency(IBSA).  As robots increasingly take on manual labor and autonomous vehicles, depending on AI helps to increase mobilities. This seems to minimize the role of human involvement of things from product-production to decisionmaking. However, the role of human involvement has changed. All of us are responsible for guiding developments in these technologies and in the decisions we make on a daily basis. To do this, however, we must develop a balanced, comprehensive insight of how technology is affecting our lives and how technology lifts humanity into a new moral consciousness.

However, they should not be viewed lightly because they can substantially affect decision-making process. In this regard, this study sought to review the stereotypes of ICT industry and identify objective and relative stereotypes.  In the study, a decision-tree analysis was conducted on a survey result of 3,300 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to identify Korean ICT companies characteristics that distinguish them from other technology companies.

Identifying the variables that distinguish ICT companies from other technology companies with the decision-tree analysis, the study then came up with a list of objective stereotypes of ICT companies.  The findings from the stereotypes of Korean ICT companies are as follows. First, the companies are in need of technology policies that help RD planning and market penetration. Second, policies must better support the companies working to sell new products or explore new business. Third, the companies need policies that support secure protection of development outcomes and proper management of IP rights.

Compressive strength prediction of CFRP confined concrete using data mining techniques,2017,"['CFRP confined concrete', 'data mining', 'artificial neural networks', 'support vector machines']",,"During the last two decades, CFRP have been extensively used for repair and rehabilitation of existing structures as well as in new construction applications. For rehabilitation purposes CFRP are currently used to increase the load and the energy absorption capacities and also the shear strength of concrete columns. Thus, the effect of CFRP confinement on the strength and deformation capacity of concrete columns has been extensively studied. However, the majority of such studies consider empirical relationships based on correlation analysis due to the fact that until today there is no general law describing such a hugely complex phenomenon. Moreover, these studies have been focused on the performance of circular cross section columns and the data available for square or rectangular cross sections are still scarce. Therefore, the existing relationships may not be sufficiently accurate to provide satisfactory results. That is why intelligent models with the ability to learn from examples can and must be tested, trying to evaluate their accuracy for composite compressive strength prediction. In this study the forecasting of wrapped CFRP confined concrete strength was carried out using different Data Mining techniques to predict CFRP confined concrete compressive strength taking into account the specimens cross section circular or rectangular.Based on the results obtained, CFRP confined concrete compressive strength can be accurately predicted for circular cross sections using SVM with five and six input parameters without spending too much time. The results for rectangular sections were not as good as those obtained for circular sections. It seems that the prediction can only be obtained with reasonable accuracy for certain values of the lateral confinement coefficient due to less efficiency of lateral confinement for rectangular cross sections.",machine_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Weighted Local Naive Bayes Link Prediction,2017,"['Complex Network', 'Link Prediction', 'Naive Bayes Model', 'Weighted Network']",,"Weighted network link prediction is a challenge issue in complex network analysis. Unsupervised methods based on local structure are widely used to handle the predictive task. However, the results are still far from satisfied as major literatures neglect two important points common neighbors produce different influence on potential links weighted values associated with links in local structure are also different. In this paper, we adapt an effective link prediction modellocal naive Bayes model into a weighted scenario to address this issue. Correspondingly, we propose a weighted local naive Bayes (WLNB) probabilistic link prediction framework. The main contribution here is that a weighted cluster coefficient has been incorporated, allowing our model to inference the weighted contribution in the predicting stage. In addition, WLNB can extensively be applied to several classic similarity metrics. We evaluate WLNB on different kinds of real-world weighted datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs better (by AUC and Prec) than several alternative methods for link prediction in weighted complex networks.",naive_bayes_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Attribute weighting for averaged one-dependence estimators,2017,,,"PAveraged one-dependence estimators (AODE) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that relaxes the conditional independence assumption that governs standard naive Bayes learning algorithms. AODE has demonstrated reasonable improvement in terms of classification performance when compared with a naive Bayes learner. However, AODE does not consider the relationships between the super-parent attribute and other normal attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on AODE that weighs the relationship between the attributes called weighted AODE (WAODE), which is an attribute weighting method that uses the conditional mutual information metric to rank the relations among the attributes. We have conducted experiments on University of California, Irvine (UCI) benchmark datasets and compared accuracies between AODE and our proposed learner.

Although we used the Mahalanobis distance method, which is a common method for outlier detection, we found that this outlier detection method was unreliable. Alternatively, the Naive Bayes Classification method was utilized to detect the outliers and to verify the impact factors. This choice of method was based on the fact that the high correlation among the demographic characteristics and residential satisfaction of respondents are critical elements in the Naive Bayes Classification. The findings include that firstly, about 2,400 samples (12 of total) of the  2014 Housing Condition Survey  were detected as outliers.

Memory-Efficient NBNN Image Classification,2017,"['Image classification', 'NBNN', 'Hashing', 'Memory efficiency', 'Indexing']",,"Naive Bayes nearest neighbor (NBNN) is a simple image classifier based on identifying nearest neighbors. NBNN uses original image descriptors (e.g., SIFTs) without vector quantization for preserving the discriminative power of descriptors and has a powerful generalization characteristic. However, it has a distinct disadvantage. Its memory requirement can be prohibitively high while processing a large amount of data. To deal with this problem, we apply a spherical hashing binary code embedding technique, to compactly encode data without significantly losing classification accuracy. We also propose using an inverted index to identify nearest neighbors among binarized image descriptors. To demonstrate the benefits of our method, we apply our method to two existing NBNN techniques with an image dataset. By using 64 bit length, we are able to reduce memory 16 times with higher runtime performance and no significant loss of classification accuracy.

Management-Reserve Estimation for International Construction Projects Based on Risk-Informed k-NN,2017,,,"PInternational construction projects normally involve high levels of risk. To reduce such risk, contractors typically include a reserve to mitigate cost overruns and schedule delays. This reserve comprises two categories (1)a contingency reserve covering potentially required changes, and (2) a management reserve (MR) covering unplanned changes. Since estimating an MR is difficult because the inherent risks are unpredictable, the traditional percentage method is still used for this purpose. To address this shortcoming, this study proposes an MR estimation method based on the cost and schedule performance ratios of international construction projects. K-nearest neighbor (k-NN) is applied to retrieve similar projects and a genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the retrieved cases. Finally, case studies are conducted to validate the estimated ratios and test the applicability of the proposed MR estimation method. The case study results show that the proposed method can infer the cost and schedule performance ratios within a 5 error rate. As a result, it can estimate the MR more accurately than the traditional percentage method. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.P",k-NN_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

However, in the backward (nucleus-going) direction, the psi(2S) meson is preferentially suppressed by a factor of similar to 2. This suppression is attributed in some models to the breakup of the weakly bound psi(2S) meson through final-state interactions with comoving particles, which have a higher density in the nucleus-going direction.

Deep Neural Network Self-training Based on Unsupervised Learning and Dropout,2017,"['Neural network', 'Pre-training', 'Semi-supervised learning', 'Self-training', 'Dropout']",,"In supervised learning methods, a large amount of labeled data is necessary to find reliable classification boundaries to train a classifier. However, it is hard to obtain a large amount of labeled data in practice and it is time-consuming with a lot of cost to obtain labels of data. Although unlabeled data is comparatively plentiful than labeled data, most of supervised learning methods are not designed to exploit unlabeled data. Self-training is one of the semisupervised learning methods that alternatively repeat training a base classifier and labeling unlabeled data in training set. Most self-training methods have adopted confidence measures to select confidently labeled examples because high-confidence usually implies low error. A major difficulty of self-training is the error amplification. If a classifier misclassifies some examples and the misclassified examples are included in the labeled training set, the next classifier may learn improper classification boundaries and generate more misclassified examples. Since base classifiers are built with small labeled dataset and are hard to earn good generalization performance due to the small labeled dataset. Although improving training procedure and the performance of classifiers, error occurrence is inevitable, so corrections of self-labeled data are necessary to avoid error amplification in the following classifiers. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based approach for alleviating the problems of self-training by combining schemes pre-training, dropout and error forgetting.

딥 러닝 군집화를 이용한 QPSK 신호 비트 오류율 성능 평가,2017,"['clustering-based unsupervised learning', 'detection', 'deep learning']","딥 러닝 분야에서 활용되고 있는 군집화에 기반한 자율학습(CUL, Clustering-based Unsupervised Learning) 기법을 QPSK 검파에 적용하였다. 기존 QPSK 검파는 전송 심볼의 참조 성상점을 기준으로 최대공산(ML, Maximum Likelihood)에 의해서 수행되었던 반면, CUL을 사용하면 군집이 네 개라는 정보만으로 검파를 수행하게 된다. CUL에서는 자율학습에 입력으로 제공되는 심볼 집합의 크기와 중심점 결정을 위한 반복 회수 및 신호 대 잡음비가 검파 성능을 결정하며, 검파 성능은 추정된 중심점과 참조 성상점 사이의 평균 자승 오차와 비트 오류율을 통하여 평가하였다. CUL으로 검파할 때, 임의로 선택된 초기 중심점을 사용하는 경우 신호 대 잡음비가 개선되어도 비트 오류율이 개선되지 않는다는 사실을 발견하였다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위하여 QPSK 검파에 적합한 초기 중심점 선택 기법을 제안하였으며, 이를 통하여 딥 러닝 기법을 이용한 검파에서 기존의 ML 검파와 동일한 수준의 비트오류율 성능을 달성하였다.","We apply the clustering-based unsupervised learning (CUL) in deep learning field to QPSK detection. The conventional QPSK detection has been performed by maximum likelihood (ML) based on the reference symbols. On the other hand, if the CUL is used, the detection is performed with only information of the number of clusters. In the CUL, the detection performance is determined by the size of the symbol set, the number of repetitions and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The detection performance is evaluated through the mean square error between the estimated center and reference symbols and bit error rate (BER). We found that the BER is not improved even if the SNR is improved when using arbitrarily selected initial center points. To solve this problem, we propose an initial center-point selection technique suitable for the QPSK detection, and achieve BER performance equal to that of conventional ML detection.",unsupervised_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

This enables us to avoid a direct comparison of the sketch query and the projected images of the 3D objects and to use the learned robust sparse features of the trained sketch images in the sketch database, compensating for the difference between the user-drawn sketch image and synthesized images of the 3D mesh model. The locally-enforced feature optimization of the local and global features of the database images reduces the error and retains the feature properties.

Forest Carbon Sequestration and Optimal Harvesting Decision Considering Spb Disturbance A Real Options Approach,2017,"['real option', 'flexible harvest', 'carbon sequestration', 'southern pine beetle', 'value of uncertainty.']",,"This study evaluates the forest management decision making of loblolly pine forest in the southern U.S. using the real option approach. The study incorporates three uncertainties that forest owners have faced including timber price volatility, forest carbon sequestration, and impacts of insect outbreaks into the real option model to investigate the relationship between such uncertainties and forest bare land value and tree rotation age. The results show that forest owners can face a mixed outcome of these uncertainties when they make forest management decisions, and the real option approach helps the forest managers consider future consequence through allowing the flexible harvest decision. Generally, a higher bare land value is generated if a flexible harvest decision making (real option) is allowed compared to a fixed harvest. The standing tree sequestrates CO2, and the forests role of carbon sequestration could generate extra value in the forest while insect outbreaks reduce the bare land value. The increasing social cost of carbon tends to call for increasing the bare land value of forest tree rotation age. Therefore, as climate change becomes more looming due to CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, the value of standing forests would increase due to enhancing opportunity cost of carbon sequestration in forests. Continuous efforts of pest management for forests are necessary since a higher insect risk tends to reduce the bare land value of forests.

The analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of traffic accidents was performed by kernel density analysis, hotspot analysis, space time cube analysis, and Emerging HotSpot Analysis. The factors affecting the severity of traffic accidents were analyzed using decision tree model. The results show that traffic accidents in Seoul are more frequent in suburbs than in central areas. Especially, traffic accidents concentrated in some commercial and entertainment areas in Seocho and Gangnam, and the traffic accidents were more and more intense over time. In the case of death traffic accidents, there were statistically significant hotspot areas in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Guro-gu, Jongno-gu, Jung-gu and Seongbuk. However, hotspots of death traffic accidents by time zone resulted in different patterns. In terms of traffic accident severity, the type of accident is the most important factor.

Data from Korea Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS) 2008 and 2014 was used to analyze what factors affect household debt and how much each factor contributes by using the debts, assets, and expenditures of households as variables. Data mining technique (decision-making tree model) was applied to forecast the size of debt by the characteristics of households. The analysis found that 3 factors related to house (long-term lease (Jeonse) money deposit, debt, and debt interest) primarily led households to take out loans from financial institutions, which, in turn, further increased overall household debt. In 2014, the gas and electricity expenses of households increased to be the fifth largest contributing factor in terms of household debt growth, following the 3 house-related factors mentioned above and other interest. As for house-related debt, the following factors are provided in the order of contribution living space, housing tenure status (owner-occupation or leased under Jeonse agreement, etc.), housing type (apartment or stand-alone house, etc.) and heating facility.Therefore, it is advisable that the Korean governments policies aiming to curb the growing household debt focus not only on loans from financial institutions, but also on Jeonse. The Korean government also needs to pay attention to other types of buildings including commercial buildings for effective household debt control, and implement a policy to curb the growth of gas and electricity expense. Additionally, household debt management policy-making process needs to involve all the relevant government entities, rather than addressed single-handedly by the Financial Services Commission, so that policies tackling household debt growth can be far-reaching and comprehensive. An overall review of the current policies and a dramatic change in policy direction is deemed necessary.",decision_tree_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

This new technology has, however, not seen massive adoption in the country. This study examined the socioeconomic and environmental benets of the agroforestry technology introduced particularly in Nyamagabe District and the challenges facing its adoption. Results showed that the agroforestry practices are contributing to an increase in income of agroforestry adopters compared to non-agroforestry adopters, and are improving soil fertility, reducing deforestation, and conserving soil and water in the district. However, results showed that, due to lack of skills and technical know-how, capital and quality seeds, some farmers are declining to adopt the new agroforestry practices. The respondents perceived that by providing subsidies to farmers, regular training, and informal education, establishing tree nurseries to improve the production of quality seeds, and also involving farmers in decision-making will increase agroforestry adoption. The government and other stakeholders should consider the views expressed by the farmers and take the necessary steps to address these challenges facing agroforestry technology adoption.",decision_tree_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
The Art of Trellis Decoding Is Fixed-Parameter Tractable,2017,,,"PGiven n subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space over a fixed finite field F, we wish to find a linear layout V-1, V-2, ... , V-n of the subspaces such that dim((V-1  V-2  ...

When restricted to 1-dimensional subspaces, this problem is equivalent to computing the trellis-width (or minimum trellis state-complexity) of a linear code in coding theory and computing the path-width of an F-represented matroid in matroid theory. We present a fixed parameter tractable algorithm to construct a linear layout of width at most k, if it exists, for input subspaces of a finite dimensional vector space over F. As corollaries, we obtain a fixed parameter tractable algorithm to produce a path-decomposition of width at most k for an input. F-represented matroid of path-width at most k, and a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to find a linear rank-decomposition of width at most k for an input graph of linear rank-width at most k. In both corollaries, no such algorithms were known previously. Our approach is based on dynamic programming combined with the idea developed by Bodlaender and Kloks (1996) for their work on path-width and tree-width of graphs. It was previously known that a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm exists for the decision version of the problem for matroid path-width a theorem by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle (2002) implies that for each fixed finite field F, there are finitely many forbidden F-representable minors for the class of matroids of path-width at most k. An algorithm by Hlineny (2006) can detect a minor in an input F-represented matroid of bounded branch-width. However, this indirect approach would not produce an actual path-decomposition.

The former existing statistical methods, or variable selection and interpretation by experts, place limits on proper judgment. Accordingly, various data mining methods, including decision tree analysis, have been developed in recent years. Cart and C5.0 are representative algorithms for decision tree analysis, but these algorithms have limits in defining the tolerance of continuous explanatory variables. Also, target variables are restricted by the information that indicates only the quality of the products like the rate of defective products. Therefore it is essential to develop an algorithm that improves upon Cart and C5.0 and allows access to new quality information such as loss cost. In this study, a new algorithm was developed not only to find the major variables which minimize the target variable, loss cost, but also to overcome the limits of Cart and C5.0. The new algorithm is one that defines tolerance of variables systematically by adopting 3 categories of the continuous explanatory variables. The characteristics of larger-the-better was presumed in the environment of programming R to compare the performance among the new algorithm and existing ones, and 10 simulations were performed with 1,000 data sets for each variable. The performance of the new algorithm was verified through a mean test of loss cost. As a result of the verification show, the new algorithm found that the tolerance of continuous explanatory variables lowered loss cost more than existing ones in the larger is better characteristics. In a conclusion, the new algorithm could be used to find the tolerance of continuous explanatory variables to minimize the loss in the process taking into account the loss cost of the products.",decision_tree_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

It has thus become challenging for physicians to identify drugs causing adverse events. This study proposes a novel approach that can improve clinical decision making with recommendations on ADE causative drugs based on patient information, drug information, and previous ADE cases.Materials and Methods We introduce a personalized and learning approach for detecting drugs with a specific adverse event, where recommendations tailored to each patient are generated using data mining techniques. Recommendations could be improvedby learning the associations of patients and ADEs as more ADE cases are accumulated through iterations. After consulting the system-generated recommendations, a physician can alter prescriptions accordingly and report feedback, enabling the systemto evolve with actual causal relationships.Results A prototype system is developed using ADE cases reported over 1.5 years and recommendations obtained from decision tree analysis are validated by physicians. Two representative cases demonstrate that the personalized recommendations could contribute to more prompt and accurate responses to ADEs.Conclusion The current system where the information of individual drugs exists but is not organized in such a way that facilitates the extraction of relevant information together can be complemented with the proposed approach to enhance the treatment of patientswith ADEs. Our illustrative results show the promise of the proposed system and further studies are expected to validate its performance with quantitative measures.",decision_tree_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Although Kesu is commonly referred to as Katsura Tree (Cercidiphyllum japonicum Siebold  Zucc) these days, it was actually introduced to and planted in Korea during Japanese colonial era. Before then, the plant did not exist in Korean peninsula. Therefore, the present Cassia does not refer to the Kesu found in Koreas ancient literatures.  If so, which tree was the real Kesu that was referred to in Korea? Kesu, as it is already known, is an imaginary tree mostly used as a material for poetry and prose rather than a record of real plant. Therefore, it is difficult to discuss what kind of tree species this refers to. Despite the fact, this study would like to clarify the true nature of Kesu because it has been confirmed that the name Kesu found in Koreas ancient literatures refers to a specific plant.  In particular, trees that grew in the Mt. Geumgangsan area were referred to as Kesu, which means that the name is related to the distribution of plants growing in a certain area or the dialect of the area. Confirmation of this fact lead to the decision that study on Kesu appearing in Koreas ancient literatures should be proceeded.  In this study, the symbolic meaning of Kesu used in Korean poetry will be briefly examined first, and then information on Kesu in the area of Mt. Geumgangsan will be discussed. Grasping these factors should enable us to have general understanding of the classical plant name of Kesu, and may provide a clue to distinguish between the Kesu of a symbolic meaning and the Cassia in real existence.",decision_tree_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Strieff(2016) 판결에서, 위법수집증거배제법칙은 이 원칙을 적용함으로써 얻게 되는 이익이 비용을 초과할 경우에만 정당화된다는 전제 하에, 경찰의 불법검문 중에 컴퓨터조회를 통하여 이미 체포영장이 발부된 사실을 발견하였을 경우는, 시간적 근접성, 영장발부사실 발견에 대한 예견가능성, 위법행위의 명백성 등을 고려할 때, 체포현장에서의 압수물과 공무원의 위법행위의 불법성은 이미 발부된 영장의 존재로 인하여 희석되므로 압수물은 증거로서 허용된다고 판시하였다. 그리고 Rodriguez v. United States(2015)에서는, 경찰의 자동차 검문시에는 예컨대 티켓 발부, 도로교통의 안전, 제한된 범위에서의 경찰관의 안전 등과 같이 검문의 목적과 밀접한 범위 내에서만 허용되는 것이고, 마약탐지견을 이용한 수색은 이러한 범위를 벗어나는 것이라고 판단하였다. 또한 United States v. Jones(2012) 판결은 만장일치로, 경찰이 정보수집을 목적으로 개인의 차량에 GPS를 설치하여 추적 감시하는 행위는 프라이버시를 침해하는 수색에 해당한다고 보았다. 그러나 결론에 이르는 근거에 있어서는 대법관들의 의견이 나뉘었고, 앞으로 영장이 요구되는 경우는 어떠한 경우인지, 합리적 의심의 기준은 너무 부담스러운 것인지, 또는 국가안보와 긴급한 상황의 경우에는 법집행기관의 재량을 허용될 수 있는 것인지 등의 많은 법적 쟁점들에 관한 질문을 남기게 되었다. 오늘날의 첨단 디지털 시대를 맞아, 이메일 계정, 컴퓨터상에 저장된 정보데이터베이스, 휴대폰 사용내역, 은행계좌 거래내역 등은 범죄 탐지, 소추를 위한 수사기관의 막강한 수단으로 기능하게 되었다. 이러한 상황에서, 미연방대법원의 판례에서 제3자이론 대신에 등장하는 모자이크이론 등을 통하여 알 수 있듯이, 적법절차의 요건으로서 검문이나 압수수색 등에 있어서 허용될 수 있는 시간과 범위 등의 요건 심사를 통하여 엄격한 법집행을 요구하고, 법관의 영장발부를 요건화 하여 사법통제를 통한 경찰의 자의적인 법집행과 남용을 방지하기 위한 노력이 요청되고 있다. 그리고 어느 범위에서 모자이크이론을 적용하는 것이 삼권분립의 원리나 수사기관과 국민 간의 충돌하는 이익의 조화로운 균형을 이룰 수 있을 것인지는 끊임없이 탐구되고 분석되어야 할 과제임이 분명할 것이다.","Since the early 20th century, the U.S. Supreme Court has applied the exclusionary rule to protect peoples right against illegal search and seizure. Also, the fruit of poisonous tree doctrine and its exceptions such as the independent source doctrine, the inevitable discovery doctrine, the attenuation doctrine, and the good faith exception have been developed, along with the legal concepts of resonable expectation of privacy, probable cause, and reasonable suspicion. Recently, in Utah v. Strieff (2016), U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the discovery of an outstanding arrest warrant during an illegal traffic stop attenuates the taint of the illegal police conduct and that the evidence seized in a search incident to arrest is admissible considering the short time period, the foreseeability of discovering the arrest warrant, and the potential for flagrancy. In Rodriguez v. United States (2015), the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly and concretely defined the reasonable durational scope for a traffic stop, which should be measured by police tasks closely tied to the original reason or mission for the stop writing a ticket, related roadway safety concerns, and a limited category of officer safety concerns, and not by other crime-detection activities such as canine sniffs unrelated to the original stop. In United States v. Jones (2012), US Supreme Court ruled that the governmetns trespass in installing a GPS device on a vehicle for the purpose of obtaining information constituted a Fourth Amendment search. However, the decision resulted in three separate opinions applying vastly different rationales and raised significant issues for future consideration, such as whether a search warrant is required, whether a reasonable suspicion standard is too onerous, or whether executive discretion is agreeable with regard to national security or other exigent exceptions. In the modern era of information and telecommunication technology, the mosaic theory, not the third party theory, would contribute to restoring a reasonable balance between the individuals interest in privacy and the interest of law enforcement in detecting and prosecuting crimes. The mosaic theory imposes limits on deployment and the use of Big Data and digital surveillance technology that make collecting and aggregating large quantity of personal information possible. The purpose of the exclusionary rule and the courts role in the constitutional protection of privacy in the course of criminal investigation are imperative and should not be underestimated.",decision_tree_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Without such power, contracting parties do not have incentives to comply with contract. Consequently, transaction costs would surge and social welfare would be reduced.Nonetheless, voting agreements in Korea among shareholders have surprisingly weak binding power. According to a handful number of lower court decisions, specific performance nor injunction for voting agreements are not granted. This means that the non-breaching party would have to wait years until the judgment on specific performance becomes final and conclusive. Taking into account that timing matters critically in contexts where voting agreements are made, this is not different from excluding specific performance and injunction as a remedy for voting agreements.In this paper, the relationship between the binding power of contract and efficiency is introduced in II. Calebresi and Melameds and Ulens precedent researches on remedies for entitlements and contracts are reviewed in . In , that binding agreements are made in closed corporations with high volatility of corporation value is noted, and that under such situation, specific performance and injunction are more efficient remedies compared with expectation damages is shown through two approaches one of transaction cost and the other regarding game-tree-like expression. It is concluded that the binding power of voting agreements in Korea is excessively weak, resulting in great increase of transaction costs.In conclusion, this paper argues that specific performance and injunction should be explicitly allowed as a remedy for voting agreements among shareholders in Korea.

There are various techniques such as neural networks, association rules, decision trees, and cluster analysis. In this paper, we propose a measure applying a J measure called cross entropy among the objective interest measures used in association rule mining. When the association rule is created, it is judged whether or not the association rule is generated by the size of confidence. When the position of the item is changed, the confidence degree is changed. Therefore, if the difference of two confidence values is large, it is difficult to judge which one to decide whether to generate association rules based on which one. To solve this problem, we propose a modified symmetric J measure. We also use examples to explore the usefulness of this measure through comparison with existing measures related to J measures.",decision_tree_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

They considered that these decisions of the Constitutional Courtshould be the same to the case of Sakhalin Koreans and then, if the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs would proceed to the diplomatic channel to settle this dispute, the case in Japan would be meaningless.Afterwards Korean government requested Japanese government to hold the diplomatic channel, but Japanese government refused by non-response policy. In this circumstance, a claim for compensation was filed to the Seoul Central District Court for the reason why Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs have violated the obligation to proceed the next step to submit the dispute to the arbitral commission.

In this case, it is difficult to judge reasonably whether or not the association rule is satisfied when the value of confidence varies depending on the position of the items. To solve this problem, we proposed a symmetric J measure that can replace the elementary association threshold among the entropy-based measures used in the decision tree method of data mining. While the existing J measure presents the degree of association between the two items in only one direction, the symmetric J measure is a measure that simultaneously considers the strength of the association in both directions, so that the magnitude of the value is larger than the measure.

Bag-of-concepts Comprehending document representation through clustering words in distributed representation,2017,"['Bag-of-concepts', 'Interpretable document representation', 'Word2vec clustering']",,"PBAbstractBP  PTwo document representation methods are mainly used in solving text mining problems. Known for its intuitive and simple interpretability, the bag-of-words method represents a document vector by its word frequencies. However, this method suffers from the curse of dimensionality, and fails to preserve accurate proximity information when the number of unique words increases. Furthermore, this method assumes every word to be independent, disregarding the impact of semantically similar words on preserving document proximity. On the other hand, doc2vec, a basic neural network model, creates low dimensional vectors that successfully preserve the proximity information. However, it loses the interpretability as meanings behind each feature are indescribable. This paper proposes the bag-of-concepts method as an alternative document representation method that overcomes the weaknesses of these two methods. This proposed method creates concepts through clustering word vectors generated from word2vec, and uses the frequencies of these concept clusters to represent document vectors. Through these data-driven concepts, the proposed method incorporates the impact of semantically similar words on preserving document proximity effectively. With appropriate weighting scheme such as concept frequency-inverse document frequency, the proposed method provides better document representation than previously suggested methods, and also offers intuitive interpretability behind the generated document vectors. Based on the proposed method, subsequently constructed text mining models, such as decision tree, can also provide interpretable and intuitive reasons on why certain collections of documents are different from others.P   PBHighlightsBP  P UL LI  Document vectors are represented as the bag of concepts.

In recent years, data mining methods as a solution to discovery and extraction of available knowledge in database has been more popular in e-commerce service fields such as, in particular, movie recommendation. However, most of the classification approaches for predicting the movie popularity have used only several types of information of the movie such as actor, director, rating score, language and countries etc.In this study, we propose a classification-based support vector machine (SVM) model for predicting the movie popularity based on movies genre data and social network data. Social network analysis (SNA) is used for improving the classification accuracy. This study builds the movies network (one mode network) based on initial data which is a two mode network as user-to-movie network. For the proposed method we computed degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality as centrality measures in movies network. Those four centrality values and movies genre data were used to classify the movie popularity in this study. The logistic regression, neural network, nave Bayes classifier, and decision tree as benchmarking models for movie popularity classification were also used for comparison with the performance of our proposed model. To assess the classifiers performance accuracy this study used MovieLens data as an open database.

The major results of this study are the following First, as a result of analyzing the current status of employment, we find that the employment rates by major are the highest in engineering department, social department, humanities department, education department, arts and physical department, natural department in order. Employment rates are high if a graduate belongs to categories of Male, New entrance, Within-entrance, School record scholarship recipients, Exchange student, Economics  business double major, Not exceeded registration, Internship, Participation in employment support program. Employment rate differentials are not significant if a graduate belongs to categories of Recruitment classification, High school area, High school classification, Total double major. Second, as a result of the hypothesis test, we find that there was a difference in employment outcomes by major. Gender(male students), admission classification(new entrance students) have positive effects on the employment outcomes in relation to socioeconomic factors. In terms of school life factors, the higher the graduation average score, the higher the job performance. we find that the case of students who went to exchange students and the case of economics and business double major have positive effects on the employment outcomes, but the registration of the excess semester has a negative effect on the employment outcomes. The experiences of internship experience and participation in job support program have positive effects on the employment outcomes. Third, influences of Internship status, Participation in employment support program, Major, Economic  business double major, Gender and Admission classification in employment decision were found to be significant. Factors that can be controlled by individual efforts, such as Internship status, Participation in employment support programs, and whether they are engaged in Economic  business double major, are found to be more influential than those that are difficult to be improved at the individual level such as Major, Gender, and Admission classification. This study examines the major determinants of employment which have been merely understood with intuitional grounds, by providing empirical analysis on official data in the administrative system of University A. Based on its results, we suggest that various and useful student-tailored employment guidelines be set up at the university level in order to improve university outcomes in employment of its graduates.",decision_tree_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

To solve this problem, documents are clustered in various ways and generally K-Means algorithm is used to achieve it. K-Means algorithm is adequate to cluster so many documents rapidly and easily, but it does not consider the meaning of documents on clustering. In this research, we propose a document clustering technique of using meaning-based paragraphs. The proposed technique divides documents in a document set into meaning-based paragraphs by measuring similarity between sentences, chooses representative paragraphs having the maximum coherence value from each document, and then commits K-Means algorithm depending on them. In this paper, different from existing methods, we proposed a novel similarity function between two adjacent sentences by using WordNet as a ontology to calculate the similarity between words. And we introduced a method which can be used to calculate coherence of meaning-based paragraph by normalizing the sum of tf-idf value of words in the paragraph. We conducted experiments to prove the performance of the proposed technique by using the Reuter-21578 document set. The experimental result showed the document clustering technique of using meaning-based paragraphs improves the precision and the recall of document retrieval.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

In computer vision, Homography is used for camera pose estimation in augmented reality system with markerless. To estimating Homography, several algorithm like SURF features which extracted from images are used. Based on extracted features, Homography is estimated. For this purpose, RANSAC algorithm is well used to estimate homography and DCS-RANSAC algorithm is researched which apply constraints dynamically based on Constraint Satisfaction Problem to improve performance. In DCS-RANSAC, however, the dataset is based on pattern of feature distribution of images manually, so this algorithm cannot classify the input image, pattern of feature distribution is not recognized in DCS-RANSAC algorithm, which lead to reduce its performance. To improve this problem, we suggest the KCS-RANSAC algorithm using K-means clustering in CS-RANSAC to cluster the images automatically based on pattern of feature distribution and apply constraints to each image groups. The suggested algorithm cluster the images automatically and apply the constraints to each clustered image groups.

The study result suggests two implementations. First one is the behavioral characteristics of leisure sports by life characteristics. In K-means cluster analysis, it was classified into 3 groups ostentation type, well-being seeking type, exercise type Ostentation type is a group with conspicuous leisure sports participation behavior, but negative to well-being. Also, they were quiet young who are close to participation rather than active exercise. Well-being seeking type saw healthy food, sleeping and resting along with exercise as important and most of them were in their 40s or older, and with high-income. Exercise type is a type focusing on physical training through exercise which showed high interest toward well-being, and mostly shown in the 20s and 60s. Second is the analysis of participation characteristic of leisure sports and market segmentation. The ostentation type is classified as a group preferring premium goods such as premium sportswear and premium goods. As for the demographic characteristics, they were young generation below age 30, and showed high purchase power compared to income. The well-being seeking type is a group interested in sleeping, meal and physics who are in their 40-50s with income level of the middle class or higher. As for the exercise type, it is a group of strong physical ability who are not well-being type nor ostentation type.

The row housing and multiplex housing is a blind spot for real estate information. Because there is a social problem, due to the change in market size and information asymmetry due to changes in demand. Also, the 5 or 25 districts used by the Seoul Metropolitan Government or the Korean Appraisal Board(hereafter, KAB) were established within the administrative boundaries and used in existing real estate studies. This is not a district classification for real estate researches because it is zoned urban planning. Based on the existing study, this study found that the city needs to reset the Seoul Metropolitan Governments spatial structure in estimating future housing prices. So, This study attempted to classify the area without spatial heterogeneity by the reflected the property price characteristics of row housing and Multiplex housing. In other words, There has been a problem that an inefficient side has arisen due to the simple division by the existing administrative district. Therefore, this study aims to cluster Seoul as a new area for more efficient real estate analysis. This study was applied to the hedonic model based on the real transactions price data of row housing and multiplex housing. And the K-Means Clustering algorithm was used to cluster the spatial structure of Seoul. In this study, data onto real transactions price of the Seoul Row housing and Multiplex Housing from January 2014 to December 2016, and the official land value of 2016 was used and it provided by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport(hereafter, MOLIT). Data preprocessing was followed by the following processing procedures Removal of underground transaction, Price standardization per area, Removal of Real transaction case(above 5 and below -5). In this study, we analyzed data from 132,707 cases to 126,759 data through data preprocessing. The data analysis tool used the R program. After data preprocessing, data model was constructed. Priority, the K-means Clustering was performed. In addition, a regression analysis was conducted using Hedonic model and it was conducted a cosine similarity analysis. Based on the constructed data model, we clustered on the basis of the longitude and latitude of Seoul and conducted comparative analysis of existing area. The results of this study indicated that the goodness of fit of the model was above 75  and the variables used for the Hedonic model were significant. In other words, 5 or 25 districts that is the area of the existing administrative area are divided into 16 districts. So, this study derived a clustering method of row housing and multiplex housing in Seoul using K-Means Clustering algorithm and hedonic model by the reflected the property price characteristics. Moreover, they presented academic and practical implications and presented the limitations of this study and the direction of future research. Academic implication has clustered by reflecting the property price characteristics in order to improve the problems of the areas used in the Seoul Metropolitan Government, KAB, and Existing Real Estate Research. Another academic implications are that apartments were the main study of existing real estate research, and has proposed a method of classifying area in Seoul using public information(i.e., real-data of MOLIT) of government 3.0. Practical implication is that it can be used as a basic data for real estate related research on row housing and multiplex housing. Another practical implications are that is expected the activation of row housing and multiplex housing research and, that is expected to increase the accuracy of the model of the actual transaction.

In real data, missing values often occur in some variables, and when cluster analysis is conducted for missing data, it is common to exclude observations with missing values. However, in this case, missing values cannot be classified into any group, and it may cause biases in estimating cluster centers. Therefore, to include observations with missing values in cluster analysis, it is often to impute missing values and conduct cluster analysis using imputed data. A disadvantage of this imputation approach is to conduct imputation without using cluster information. In this study, we propose methods to impute missing values using cluster information.

KIFRS 도입 이전과 이후를 분석하기 위해서 이전기간은 2006년부터 2007년까지로 이후기간은 2012년부터 2103년까지로 구분하였고, 유가증권과 코스닥에 상장되어 있는 기업을 표본으로 선정하여 총 3,516 기업년도를 이용하였다.  본 연구의 분석결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, IFRS 도입 이후에 기업집단의 재량적 발생액 수준이 이전에 비해 증가하였다. KIFRS 도입 이후에 기업집단의 재량적 발생액 수준이 증가하는 이유에 대해서는 KIFRS가 비기업집단보다 기업집단의 경영자들에게 회계선택과 공정가치 평가에 대한 기회를 더 많이 제공하기 때문이라고 판단된다. 둘째, KIFRS 도입 이후에 기업집단의 실제활동 이익조정 수준이 감소하였다. 이러한 결과는 KIFRS 도입 이후에 기업집단의 발생액을 이용한 이익조정이 증가 하고 실제활동을 이용한 이익조정이 감소함으로써 이익조정간에 대체관계가 있다는 것을 보여준다.  추가분석에 따른 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, KIFRS 도입 이후에 실제활동 이익조정 개별 측정치 모두 감소하였다. 둘째, 성향점수매칭(PSM) 방법에 따른 분석에서도 본 분석과 동일한 결과를 얻었으며, 본 연구의 결과가 기업집단의 내생성 때문에 나타난 이유보다는 기업집단이 원칙주의 회계기준을 경영자의 이익조정에 활용할 수 있는 기회가 많아졌기 때문이라는 것을 알 수 있다. 마지막으로 이익조정 측정치의 절대값 분석, 기업집단비기업집단 표본을 구분하여 분석을 실시하였으며, 그 결과는 본 연구결과를 강건하게 한다.  본 연구의 결과가 제공하는 시사점은 IFRS 도입 이후 경영자들이 회계기준을 선택할 수 있는 폭이 넓어진 만큼 동일한 국가 내에서도 터널링 가설(tunneling hypothesis)에 근거하여 기업집단의 경영자가 기회주의적 이익조정을 할 유인이 더 크다는 것이다. 또한 본 연구를 통해서 KIFRS 도입 전후를 비교함으로써 기업집단의 이익조정에 대한 새로운 정보를 제공하였다.","This study investigates the effect of KIFRS on earnings management of chaebol firms.

The results are as follows. First, we find that discretionary accruals earnings management of chaebol firms increases after KIFRS adoption, which suggests that managers of chaebol firms have more chances to conduct earnings management with various choices of accounting standards and fair valuation after KIFRS adoption. Second, we find that realactivities earnings management of chaebol firms decreases after KIFRS adoption, which means that the adoption of KIFRS makes the tradeoff between discretionary accruals and realactivities earnings management of chaebol firms.  The results of additional analysis are as follows. First, we find that abnormal operating cash flow, abnormal discretionary expenses, and abnormal production costs all decrease after KIFRS through analysis by individual factor of realactivities earnings management. Second, we find that the results with PSM (Propensity Score Matching) are the same with the main results, which means that our results are due to more opportunities of earnings management with various choices of accounting standards and fair valuation under KIFRS in chaebol firms, not merely because of endogeneity of chabol firms. Finally, we perform regressions with subsample of chaebol and nonchaebol and regressions with absolute value of discretionary accruals earnings management and realactivities earnings management and the results make the main results from regressions with total sample robust.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The results are as follows. First, we find that the comparability increases after K-IFRS adoption, which means that accountants and auditors try to develop internal working rules to standardize accounting practice to apply the principle-based accounting standards(Kothari et al. 2010). Second, we find that the comparability of firm-pairs audited by the same Big 4 auditor increase more than that audited by the different auditors after K-IFRS adoption, which suggests that Big 4 accounting firms invest more to implement their set of internal working rule after K-IFRS adoption.The implications of our study is that the comparability increases after K-IFRS adoption and the comparability of firm-pairs audited by the different Big 4 auditors increases as well as firm-pairs audited by the same Big 4 auditor. Therefore, K-IFRS, the principle-based accounting standards play a key role to improve the level of comparability. We also find that the comparability of firm-pairs audited by the same Big 4 auditor increase more than that audited by the different Big 4 auditors after K-IFRS adoption.

Specifically, other than the proportion of account receivable and inventory which has been known as measurement for inherent risk or complexity of accounts through prior research, we examine whether auditors reflect the inherent risk of detailed accounts such as derivatives, deferred tax, investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) and retirement benefits liabilities in audit-related variables. We also investigate whether the auditors responses to audit risk after K-IFRS(International Financial Reporting Standards, thereafter IFRS) adoption are different by auditor type such as Big4 and Non-Big4 auditors, and the differential responses to audit risk by auditor type, in any, are related to the difference in audit quality.Using 10,244 firm-year samples between 2007 and 2014, we find the following empirical results First, the inherent risks of the derivatives accounts are reflected in the audit fees, and the inherent risks of the investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) and retirement benefit liabilities accounts are reflected in both audit fees and audit efforts. And this result in significant decrease in the hourly fee rate and appeared only in Big4 auditors sample. Second, there exist increase in audit hours as a response to audit risk for derivatives, investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) accounts, and decrease in the hourly fee rate for investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) accounts in Big4 auditor sample. This is presumably due to over investment in audit effort of Big4 auditors to consolidated financial statement audits under IFRS environment which consider consolidated financial statements as primary financial statements and require auditor responsibility for the financial statements of subsidiary companies. In Non-Big4 auditor sample, there is no relationship between the inherent risk of detailed accounts and audit hours after IFRS adoption except for decrease in hourly audit fee. This means Non-Big4 auditors strategically respond to increased audit risk by using more experienced auditors. Third, there is no audit quality decline in any sample of Big4 and Non-Big4 auditors, implying that auditors keep audit quality at a certain level, even though they have perceived audit risk and complexity of the detailed accounts and performed different audit procedures by auditor type.We contribute to the existing literature by extending prior research as follows. First, this study comprehensively shows the association between the inherent audit risk and audit-related variables like audit fees could be decomposed into the inherent risks of detailed account to derivatives, deferred tax, investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) and retirement benefits liabilities accounts. Second, this study provides an explanation about the different profitability decline of Big4 and Non-Big4 rasied by prior research, as a differential risk response process by auditor type. Third, this study suggests auditors have differently responded to the inherent risk of detailed accounts but have kept audit quality to the certain level, when there is a increase in auditors liability. Finally, this study provides current literature with new audit risk measurement method about detailed account such as derivatives, deferred tax, investments on subsidiaries(affiliated companies) and retirement benefits liabilities accounts.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

By using mainly J. F. K. Rosenkranzs elaborative theory of the aesthetics of ugliness, this analysis tries to respond to the question what should be determined as caricature. The purpose of this study is essentially to expand the horizon of interpreting poetry. Caricature is noticed by this purpose because it touches the ugliness being more reinforced than satire, allegory, and parody. The most important factor crystallizing the aesthetic of caricature is the essence of caricature playing its central role in expressing its object exaggeratively. The quantitative limitation on exaggeration that Rosenkranz emphasized signifies that caricature can be established if a formative moment to evoke its original image has to remain in its transformed image. And the necessary condition of caricatures establishment that he presented is that the exaggeration of caricature to produce the displacement of ugliness through the exaggerative expression being actually distinct from the mere expansion and reinforcement or reducement and enfeeblement should be the unbalance or contortion occurring between its objects totality and parts. Meanwhile he summarized the essential productive ways of caricature into the individualization, usurpation, and downgrading. The individualization means that caricature to occur between its original image and contorted image should be transmitted by its concrete form but not reflects any concept or abstract significance. The usurpation means caricatures inflating exaggeratively deficient capabilities, and the downgrading means its degrading exaggeratively existent capabilities. Having a function of the language of aggression, caricature as such relates to the socialization of a person, as Umberto Eco held that the modern caricature emerged as an instrument of dispute over the real person or cognizable social category. Uncovering freely and humorously the real ugliness behind our lives by expressing the forms of ugliness, caricature ultimately contains the positive dreams of humans hoping indirect compensations for their greatness and agony.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Suggestions on the transformation into the Korean LAC are as follows First, professors should be assigned to an academic system in accordance with their department, but students do not need to belong to a certain department and should be allowed to do their study freely. Second, the core of liberal arts education lies in only enhanced quality of such education based on the performance and recent academic trends of basic sciences.

The K-DEMO divertor model was created and converted by the CAD (Pro-EngineerSUPSUP) and Monte Carlo automatic modeling programs as a 22.5 sector of the tokamak. The Monte Carlo neutron photon transport and ADVANTG codes were used in this calculation with the FENDL-2.1 nuclear data library. The calculation results indicate that the highest values appeared on the upper outboard target (OT) area, which means the OT is exposed to the highest radiation conditions among the three plasma-facing parts (inboard, central and outboard) in the divertor. Especially, much lower nuclear heating values and displacement damages are indicated on the lower part of the OT area than others. These are important results contributing to thermal-hydraulic and thermo-mechanical analyses on the divertor and also it is expected that the copper alloy materials may be partially used as a heat sink only at the lower part of the OT instead of the reduced activation ferritic-martensitic steel due to copper alloys high thermal conductivity.P",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

However, the specific words related to human, family and bond are more likely to be occurred in Korean suicidal notes. In particular, cognitive constraints in psychological domain such as limitation and restriction as well as negatively emotional words were more prevalent in Korean suicidal notes. Among 40 words most appeared over both suicidal notes, guilty, family and death in Korean suicidal notes were more exposed, while self and conception of death itself in U.S. suicidal notes were more revealed.

In China, Ming Dynasty was replaced by Qing, and even in Japan, the regime change occurred, but the Choson Dynasty which was at the center of the war continued in the Korean peninsula. Regarding this situation, JaHyun K. Haboush, the author of The Great East Asian War and Birth of Korean Nation, argued that a discourse of nation emerged on the Korean peninsula instead of regime change. This claim of applying the nation or the discourse of nation, which was mainly discussed in the modern period, to the pre-modern Korea was quite unusual. The author used B. Anderson s Imagined Communities theory to prove the discourse of nation that occurred in Choson before and after the Imjin War. The author proves his argument through the emergence of Righteous Army during the Imjin War, the use of Hangeul, and the postwar commemoration projects. The Righteous Army embodied the patriotism based on righteousness and loyalty of people who voluntarily risked their lives and left for the battlefield, even though they had no experience or duty to do so, and created the imagined community of Choson. Hangeul, which was used as a means to exclude the other nations during the war, rose to the complementary position of Chinese characters. If Hangeul had represented the national character during the war, it created in the postwar period a horizontal space that produced and circulated Korean discourses in the area of subculture. The Choson government promoted the nationalization of war memories by pursuing a wide range of postwar memorial projects. The main purpose to remember the war was to nourish patriotism by creating a space where people can share their patriotism. As such, the author argued that the various signs that appeared before and after the Imjin War were evidence of the imagined community shared by the Korean people. The patriotism, which is the character of the Righteous Army argued by the author through this book, meant honor and loyalty, which are the neo-Confucian values. Honor and loyalty were the ethics of Confucianism which had started from the warring states period in China with the philosophy of fidelity, and the object of execution of honor was the universal value including the loyalty to China and the Son of Heaven beyond the King of Choson. This perception is revealed in the exhortation letter and poem analyzed by the author. In addition, reviewing the arguments of this book in terms of sustainability, consistency, and connectivity presented by the author as conditions of national formation, there are certain elements that do not satisfy the conditions in the areas such as the transition of character of Righteous Army, the status of Korean language in the late Choson era and the change of essence in the post war memorial projects. Especially, there could be totally different results according to the way of how to characterize Sinocentrism that dominated Choson society. However, this book did not properly characterize the characteristics of Sinocentrism. This book was from unfinished manuscripts of Haboush and had been edited and published, thus her thoughts and intentions may not have been fully reflected. However, the subject consciousness thrown by the author was heavy enough to open a new chapter in the history of the Imjin war as well as the study of the Choson dynasty.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

This study analyzed the poem with a focus on dadaism, expressionism, futurism andsurrealism on the basis of the stylistic features of avant-garde literature established by Zoltn Szab and Gza Vasy.First, the poem is most strikingly characterized by meaningless vocabulary that shows only phonetic features without semantic rationality. Such vocabulary does not simply derive from pun or fun, but reveals the essence of the timeswhen artistic rationality and value system collapsed completely. Second, the poem uses exclamations and exaggerative words, such as roppant, nagy, tele, ris, vilg and minden, and metaphors and symbols so frequently as to prevent the understanding of poetic meanings. They are expressionistic features that represent the fear for war, the destruction of reason and the inner confusion of mankind. Third, the poem often shows simultaneity and dynamics, which are the greatest features of futurism. Specifically, events sometimes occur in disorderand mixture in different times and spaces, and emotional shouts, imitative words, or exclamations are frequently employed. Lastly, the poem has surrealistic features fantasies or dreams are artfully mixed with realities, with many scenes intentionally disturbing consciousness through unconsciousness the narrator s consciousness hovers between reality and fantasy by the medium of specific words, e.g. conjunction like de.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

In this study, we report the baseline characteristics of this retrospective cohort.Subjects and Methods In the present study we analyzed datasets of 3073 patients with 3972 target limbs from a retrospective cohort treated with endovascular therapy in 31 Korean hospitals. Data regarding patient baseline clinical and lesion characteristics and postintervention medications were collected from electronic medical records.Results The mean patient age was 68.39.4 years. The majority were male (82.1) with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (58.0), hypertension (73.4), and coronary artery disease (CAD 55.3). Patients more commonly presented with intermittent claudication (66.3) than with critical limb ischemia (CLI 33.7). Femoropopliteal artery (41.2) was the most common target vessel for endovascular treatment, followed by the aortoiliac (35.6) and infrapopliteal arteries (23.2). TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Artery Disease (TASC II) type CD aortoiliac (48.0) or femoropopliteal lesions (60.2) were frequent targets of endovascular treatment.

However, surgical intervention is required for patients with advanced Kmmell disease accompanied by neurologic deficit.Methods We retrospectively analyzed 22 neurologically compromised patients with advanced Kmmell disease who were treated surgically at Ewha Womans Hospital between January 2011 and January 2014. The surgical approach used by us was a posterior vertebrectomy with mesh cage insertion and segmental cement-augmented pedicle screw fixation. The tissue from the corpectomy was histopathologically examined. Anterior vertebral height, kyphotic angle, visual analog scale (VAS) score, and the Frankel classification were used to evaluate the efficacy of the procedure.Results The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range, 1340 months). VAS score, anterior vertebral height, kyphotic angle, and neurologic state were significantly improved immediately postoperatively and at the last follow-up compared with preoperatively (p 0.05). Most patients exhibited intravertebral clefts on imaging, and postoperative pathology revealed bone necrosis.Conclusions Posterior vertebrectomy with mesh cage insertion and segmental cement-augmented pedicle screw fixation is an effective approach for treating patients with advanced Kmmell disease with neurologic deficit.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Methods Subjects for the study were 23 children with cerebral palsy (CP)(mean age 84.70 months) recruited from one CP clinic. For the interrater and test-retest reliabilities, four raters (A, B, C, D) measured the K-TCMS two times using video clips with an interval of two weeks. For the concurrent validity, the Korean version of the gross motor function measure (K-GMFM) was chosen. Inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability of the three K-TCMS subscale (static sitting balance, dynamic sitting balance and dynamic reaching) scores and the total scores were investigated using the intra-correlation coefficient (ICC3,1). Spearmans correlation coefficient (r) was calculated to investigate the concurrent validity. Results The inter-rater reliability of the K-TCMS subscales and total scores were all high (ICC3,10.968-0.992). For the test-retest reliability, ICC3,10.827-0.962. The concurrent validity between the K-TCMSs total and three subscale scores and K-GMFMs total score were r0.600-0.667. Conclusion The results suggest that the K-TCMS can be used in clinical and research settings as a standardized tool for CP children. The K-TCMS might be also useful for selecting treatment goals and planning interventions for children with cerebral palsy.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Surface expression of MHC class I and II molecules elevated by 27OHChol was decreased to basal levels in the presence of the inhibitors. Treatment with LY294002 or U0126 resulted in recovery of endocytic activity which was reduced by 27OHChol. CD197 expression and cell adherence enhanced by 27OHChol were attenuated in the presence of the inhibitors.Transcription and surface expression of CD molecules involved in atherosclerosis such as CD105, CD137 and CD166 were also significantly decreased by treatment with LY294002 and U0126.

In PWD, when a high current is passed through high-density metal wires, the wires explode because of resistance heating, forming fine particles or metal vapor. In this study, we used Sn-Bi and Ag wires in order to obtain three-component nanopowders. A high current was applied to the wires between the electrodes in a Nsub2sub atmosphere. We discussed the results based on the K factor, which is the ratio of the charging energy of the capacitor to the vaporization energy of the wire. The three-component (Sn-Bi-Ag) nanoparticles were synthesized under a Nsub2sub atmosphere at 4 and 6 kV. From the particle-size distribution curves, it was found that the mean particle diameter (Dsub1sub) values of the Sn-Bi and Ag nanopowders were within the range of 16.32-42.37 nm under each condition. The melting point of the Sn-Bi-Ag nanoparticles was found to be within the range of 188.68-214.97 , which is about 40  lower than that obtained from the phase diagram and computational thermodynamics of the Sn-Bi-Ag system. In this study, the nanopowders were obtained by subjecting the wires at extreme energies, to improve their solid solubility.

Schleiermacher who was German philosopher, theologist, and pedagogist indicated the fundamental problem of pedagogy was the problem, if the value of the older generation and maintenance of culture must be recognized as the core of new generation education or new generation education must focus on the improvement of tradition pursued by the older generation rather than its maintenance. However, the discussion about generation in pedagogy excluded the discussion about what is generation and how is it organized?. Mannheim sociologically showed the problems of generation and its organization. Therefore, this study firstly will analyze and suggest generation theory such as Mannheims generation and generation unit, etc., and connect Mannheims generation theory to learning habitus concept that reorganized Bourdieus habitus concept critically. The purpose of the trial is to reorganize sociological discussion about generation to pedagogical discussion about generation. Based on it, this study intends to suggest theoretical analysis frame that can be utilized andragogically. In conclusion, generation problem is pedagogically very significant from largely two angles. First, from an angle of the study on learners, it can provide practical foundation of adult education by adult learners characteristics of each generation or each generation unit. Second, from an angle of lifelong educations tasks, it can prepare the approach that can solve generational differences and conflicts, our country faces now.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The CRBS was developed to assess patients perception of the degree to which patient, provider and health system-level barriers affect their cardiac rehabilitation (CR) participation.Methods The CRBS consists of 21 items (barriers to adherence) rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The first phase was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the CRBS to the Korean language. After back-translation, both versions were reviewed by a committee. The face validity was assessed in a sample of Korean patients (n53) with history of acute myocardial infarction that did not participate in CR through semi-structured interviews. The second phase was to assess the construct and criterion validity of the Korean translation as well as internal reliability, through administration of the translated version in 104 patients, principle component analysis with varimax rotation and cross-referencing against CR use, respectively.Results The length, readability, and clarity of the questionnaire were rated well, demonstrating face validity. Analysis revealed a six-factor solution, demonstrating construct validity. Cronbachs alpha was greater than 0.65. Barriers rated highest included not knowing about CR and not being contacted by a program. The mean CRBS score was significantly higher among non-attendees (2.710.26) than CR attendees (2.510.18) (p0.01).Conclusion The Korean version of CRBS has demonstrated face, content and criterion validity, suggesting it may be useful for assessing barriers to CR utilization in Korea.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Numerical modeling for predicting ash dispersion takes operation time, which may not useful for providing information to first responders. In this study, we suggest a new scenario-based approach by using Similar-Weather-Pattern (SWP) model. The model provides ash dispersion based on the similarity of the geographical pattern of meteorological fields between target date and historical periods. Several meteorological fields over the East Asian region that are produced by WRF for 2005-2014 are clustered via k-means. The precision of SWP model is shown to depend on the sample size by comparing its performance when either 1 year or 10 year data is used. The 1 year data result shows mean euclidean distance of 178 m and the 10 year data result shows 52 m with difference in 95 of confidence level.

Above all, inter-Asia movement of various cultural practices that crack the unilateral cultural flow between Western and non-Western countries are becoming visible, and thus the studies on this topic are being actively conducted. This study pays attention to the various practices of mobility of music and its practices in contemporary Asia that takes place along with the transnational flow of population and capital. It examines the process of mobility of K-musials, Korean musicals to other parts of Asia after , focusing on the practice of K-musicals in Japan and examining its multi-layered characteristics and meanings. Korean musicals are global cultural products, which have imitated, appropriated, and interpreted American Broadway shows, and at the same time regional and hybrid cultural forms which have been transformed based on Korean discourse, production subject, capital, and market specificity. Since the mid-2000s, Korean musicals, that began in the 1960s, have moved to Asia, associated with cultural capital of hallyu. Hallyu, as an another local variant, is another cultural phenomena of transnational consumption of Korean popular culture. This study examines the production and consumption of K-musicals, which originated from the point where two cultural variants-Korean musicals and hallyu-meet. Korean musicals introduced in the 1960s through the United States have continued to be concerned about Korean identity and indigenization in relation to musicals that were power outages before. Above all, they have been Koreanized in a specific way in the frames of nationalism and globalization derived from national interest. These Koreanized musicals have emerged as cultural industry contents with the national support through the participation of large corporations and incorporation into global cultural industries. The intervention of hallyu cultural capital in the world of musicals, which is globally successful, has converted the system by making idols participate in musicals or transforming the primary hallyu contents into musicals. In this process, the participation of hallyu fandom in musicals has been crucial to visualize the movement of Korean musicals in Asia, and the Korean musicals are transformed into hallyu contents through the titles of K-musicals or Hallyu musicals. Before the 2000s, Korean musicals, which were performed intermittently in Japan, began to perform actively along with hallyu boom in Japan in mid-2000s a variety of Korean booms have occurred since 2012. This includes musicals with diverse characteristics ranging from idol musicals, drama-cals using hallyu contents, and movie-cals to small scale creative Korean musicals. K-musicals in Japan are been gradually escalated and sophisticated due to the complexity of cultural and discursive factors based on the industrial and physical foundations of Korean-Japanese musicals, such as the Korean Wave in Japan, the willingness of exchanges in the world of Korea-Japan musicals, and the transformation into global industry. Furthermore, as K-musicals in Japan have been stagnating since 2014, the interest of K-musicals is shifting to China and other Asian regions. K-musical, which was born through the standardization of the style of musical in globalized period and the symbol Korea, is granted with its own value and position in the global market by acquiring the label K, or the global distinct brand, and further producing the authority and the justification in its moving to Asia.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

In this study, we analyzed long-term grid data for temperatures and precipitation using cluster analysis. Due to the monthly difference of climate characteristics, clustering was performed by month. As the result of K-Means cluster analysis is so sensitive to initial values, we used initial values with Ward method which is hierarchical cluster analysis method.

Conclusions Under LED lighting of either 3,000 K or 6,500 K, because the color lenses of brown, green, red and gray with transmittance of about 50 to 60 did not affect the color perception, it is thought that there is no major problem with prescription and wearing. However it is recommended to pay attention to prescription and wearing since the change of CCT of LED lightings between 3,000 K and 6,500 K affect the color perception. In the case of the FM 100 hue test, the ES chart may be suitable for use as an indicator to clarify the errors of color discrimination in each color that can not be detected by the average of TES.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Sleep scales such as the Korean version of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI-K) and the Korean Version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-K) were evaluated and those with ISI-K 15 were included in the study.Psychotic, anxiety and depressive symptoms were rated with the Brief Psychotic Rating Scale (BPRS), the Korean Version of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (K-ASI), and the Korean Version of the Beck Depression Inventory-I (K-BDI), respectively. Pearson correlation analyses were performed between the sociodemographic data, ISI-K and PSQI-K. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the factors which affected the ISI-K and PSQI-K.Results The mean ISI-K and PSQI-K scores were 18.1  2.6 and 12.0  2.2, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between age of onset and ISI-K score and positive correlations between BRPS and PSQI-K scores and between K-ASI and both ISI-K and PSQI-K scores. Multiple regression analyses for both ISI-K and PSQI-K with K-ASI, age of onset, and BPRS as covariates revealed K-ASI as the only significant remaining factor.Conclusion Our study suggests that anxiety symptoms are associated with insomnia symptoms in schizophrenia patients regardless of depressive or psychotic symptoms.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

This essay consists of a brief analysis of Kmastra 1.1 and 1.2, with the aim of clarifying the way in which the text carefully asserts its own divine (apaurueya) origins as a means of establishing a religious sanction for a treatise on erotics, even as it affirms its human (paurueya) provenance and the authorship of Vtsyyana. In insisting upon the human, and thus necessarily fallible, aspect of stra, Vtsyyana nevertheless implicitly claims for himself the authority to recover the original meaning stra, and adjudicate its ambiguities. This distinction between the divine origins and human provenance of stra is thus resolved in the figure of the master (crya), and in the related concept of mastery (pratipatti).",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

So the word-order has no meaning, except in special cases.However, in case of a compound (samsa) that consists of a semantic combination of a word (pada) and a word, there is a posterior relationship that can be called a word order between the constituents. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the word-order relation of compound constituents in terms of  Prvanipta  and Upasarjana.Pini defined more than 100 grammatical rules related to the compound in Adhyy. Of these, the rules governing the word-order in relation to the above concepts are given in P. 2.2.30-P. 2.2.38. According to these rules, the word-order of the constituents of a compound is basically determined by the operation in grammar (Krya) of Upasarjana, which is called Prvanipta. Upasarjana is a name (Saj) for those that will be presented as a pratham-vibhakti in all the Compound-rules (Samsa-stra), and has the feature of preceding in order in a compound. This name is also closely related to the relation of predicate and subject (Vieaa-vieya-bhva), because it also implies Gua, i.e., apradhna, in terms of etymology. So it precedes in order in a compound. While the above rules have a restrictive effect on a compound by aprvanipta and paranipta, it is confirmed that such restrictions also act optionally.As a result, it has been confirmed that the positional relationship of the compound constituents is also controlled by the intention of the Speaker (Vivak).The review of the rules on word-order can be meaningful for the analysis of compounds that are unlikely to be understood without the help of the annotations.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The US features of each thyroid nodule were retrospectively evaluated by a single radiologist using a picture archiving and communication system. The diagnostic indices of K-TIRADS for follicular neoplasms were calculated according to whether K-TIRADS category 4 lesions were excluded or classified as benign or malignant.Results Of the 46 follicular neoplasms (mean size, 3.11.6 cm), 37 were FTAs (mean size, 3.11.7 cm) and nine were FTCs (mean size, 3.01.5 cm). A statistically significant difference was found between FTAs and FTCs regarding the margin (P0.035), while no significant differences were observed in the composition, echogenicity, shape, orientation, calcification, or vascularity of the lesions (P0.05). The FTAs belonged to K-TIRADS categories 3 (n22) and 4 (n15), while the FTCs belonged to K-TIRADS categories 3 (n4), 4 (n4), and 5 (n1). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of K-TIRADS categories between FTAs and FTCs (P0.184).Conclusion K-TIRADS features were not helpful for distinguishing FTA from FTC, although follicular neoplasms showed a high prevalence of K-TIRADS categories 3 and 4.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

That means that it would bring about the changes of tax revenue. Also IFRS 16 would allow to change tax burdens by lease classification.There is no answer about what legal effect should be given to lease transaction in tax law because it is not possible to draw a clear line between rental and financing for acquiring assets.

Bayertz)의 글을 중심으로 검토한다. 그는현대를 자신의 이익과 가치를 우선시 하는 개인주의 문화로 보고, 사회를 현상적으로 파악하는 사회학적 방법론을 가지고 영역들을 검토하고 있다. 바이예르츠는 1.도덕철학적-형이상학적 개념으로서의 연대, 2. 사회적 통합으로서의 연대, 3. 해방투쟁의 수단과 목적으로서의 연대, 4. 복지국가의 연대 등 네 가지로 분류하여 분석하고있다. 그에 의하면 이기적 인간을 전제로 하는 현대사회에서도 여전히 의미 있는 효력을 발생하는 연대성은 뒤르켕이 지적한 유기적 연대와 생태, 여성, 장애인, 동성애자 등 역사적 진보와 해방을 기다리며 저항하는 까뮈의 저항연대 정도이다. III장 소결(4)에서는 Bayertz의 한계를 지적하고 윤리학적, 형이상학적 인간 이해로 연대가능성을 보충해야 한다는 점을 밝힌다.

In the first part of this paper, we look at how the concept of solidarity has been used and developed historically in the traditions of Korea and Germany. In the second part, we use Bayertz  writings, systematically to classify areas where the concept of solidarity is used and examines the possibilities of todays solidarity. Bayertz considers these days culture as an individualist culture that prioritizes ones own interests and values, and he uses sociological methodologies to examine areas of society and try to understand it phenomenologically. Bayertz divides the solidarity into four uses 1. moral philosophical-metaphysical concept of solidarity, 2. solidarity as social unity, 3. solidarity as means and purpose of liberation struggle, 4.solidarity of welfare states. I would like to review Bayertzs four conceptions of solidarity and its possibility. According to him, solidarity, which has meaningful effects still in the modern society presupposed by selfish human beings, is the organic solidarity of Duerkheim and the revolte solidarity of Camus. Part 2 sheds light on the limitations of Bayertz ideas and suggests that the possibility of solidarity must be supplemented by ethical and metaphysical human understanding. In the conclusion, we present an alternative viewpoint, that of Catholic social theory concerning the pursuit of personal dignity, solidarity, and subsidiarity in an integrated view in terms of metaphysics, history, ethics, and politics. The conclusion will present the basis of the proposition that solidarity is a duty of humanity and a mission of Christianity.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Behavior of Temperature-Dependent DC-Photoconductivity in Hot-Wall Deposited CaAl2Se4 Layers,2017,"['CaAl2Se4', 'Photocurrent', 'Temperature dependence', 'Band gap', 'Valence-band splitting', 'Characterization']",,"The dc-photoconductive characteristic on the hot-wall grown CaAl2Se4 (CAS) layers was explored as a function of temperature. From the photocurrent (PC) measurement, three PC peaks A, B, and C corresponded to the intrinsic transitions, which represent the band-to-band transitions from the valence-band states of 2(A), 3  4(B), and 3  4(C) to the conduction-band state of 1, respectively. Based on these PC results, the optical band-gap energy was well matched by Eg(T)  Eg(0)  4.94  103T2(T  552), where Eg(0) is found to be 3.8239, 3.8716, and 3.8801 eV for three peaks A, B, and C, respectively. Thus, the effect of the crystal field and spin-orbit splitting (These values were extracted out to be 47.7 and 8.5 meV, respectively.) was observed and calculated by means of the PC spectroscopy. However, PC intensity gradually decreased with decreasing temperature unlike an ordinary behavior. In the log Jph vs 1T plot, two dominant traplevels were observed to be 20.81 meV at temperatures of 300 - 70 K and 1.18 meV at temperatures below 70 K. Consequently, we extract out that these trapping centers caused by native defects in CAS confine the PC intensity as temperature decreases.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Methods Questionnaires were distributed to 300 university students randomly selected in Gongju. Dietary survey was administered during two weekdays by the food record method. Results Subjects were divided into three groups NCG (non-coffee group), LCG (low coffee group, 12 cupsd), and HCG (high coffee group, 3 cupsd) by coffee intake amount and subjects distribution. Coffee intake frequency was significantly greater in the HCG compared to the LCG (p  0.001). The HCG was more likely to intake dripped coffee with or without milk andor sugar than the LCG (p  0.05). More than 80 of coffee drinkers chose their favorite coffee or accompanying snacks regardless of energy content. More than 75 of coffee takers did not eat accompanying snacks instead of meals, and the HCG ate them more frequently than LCG (p  0.05). Breakfast skipping rate was high while vegetable and fruit intakes were very low in most subjects. Subjects who drank carbonated drinks, sweet beverages, or alcohol were significantly greater in number in the LCG and HCG than in the NCG (p  0.01). Energy intakes from coffee were 0.88  5.62 kcald and 7.07  16.93 kcald for the LCG and HCG. For total subjects, daily mean dietary energy intake was low at less than 72 of estimated energy requirement. Levels of vitamin C and calcium were lower than the estimated average requirements while that of vitamin D was low (2434 of adequate intake). There was no difference in nutrient intakes by coffee intake amount, except protein, vitamin A, and niacin. Conclusion Coffee intake amount did not affect dietary nutrient intakes. Dietary habits were poor, and most nutrient intakes were lower than recommend levels. High intakes of coffee seemed to be related with high consumption of sweet beverages and alcohol. Therefore, it is necessary to improve nutritional intakes and encourage proper water intake habits, including coffee intake, for improved nutritional status of subjects.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Olick', 'Memorial Space', 'Spatial presentation', 'element']",,"(Background and Purpose) The urge to memorialize major events is not new. The difference is that the homages today are paid not with a painting on a cave wall or a statue in a park but often with something experiential and interactive. They do not merely evoke memories from those with direct experience of the actual past events, but they also can instill emotional reactions and empathy that feel somewhat like memories, created and sustained by those experiencing the reconstructed space of collective memories of events. Memorial spaces are those in which memory can be fully manifested and are a medium of collective memory that can link past events to the present and future. This study seeks to identify the most effective means of communicating collective memory of significant events. (Method) To begin, the researcher first studied the characteristics of collective memory theory of Maurice Halbwachs and Jeffrey K. Olick. Then, case studies were created in which a total of six memorial spaces in the national and international contemporary memorial spaces in various countries were classified by memory characteristics, how they are related to the presentation factors, and how they are expressed. (Results) Halbwachss theory of collective memory posits a correlation between the present, continuity, reconfiguration, selectivity, and place character. Olricks theory posits a correlation between persistence, selectivity, reconstruction, imagination, and temporality. The characteristics of collective memories can be divided into the memorial space area, spectator area, and spatial area. On the aspect of the memorial object, it can be classified by the characteristics of selectivity, temporality, interactivity, and reconfiguration in terms of viewers, currentness, persistence, imagination, and placeness. And the analysis model was completed through analyzed characteristics and spatial rendering factors. Finally, through the analysis model, the study analyzed the characteristics of collective memory according to the memorial space and the relationship between the form factor, proportional, circulation, light, and material, which are the spatial rendering elements, and proved to be effective. (Conclusions) This study helps identify the kind of presentation elements that can be used to express collective memory characteristics by examining the relationship between the characteristics of group memory and the presentation elements of memorial space. These can serve as guidelines for space design for those directing modern memorial spaces to function as a space for adding new memories and new meanings.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Especially, fair value evaluation model can be used on property, plant and equipment. Companies tried to improve financial condition like lowering debt ratio using asset revaluation when asset revaluation was allowed by Asset Revaluation Law during 19582000. However, Asset Revaluation Law was abolished after 2000. Asset revaluation was permitted again when K-IFRS was adopted.This study is an empirical study that analyzes the meaning of asset revaluation to auditor and information users. Many previous studies about asset revaluation suggest that asset revaluation is used as a way to improve financial condition(Song et al., 2011 Chung and Kim, 2015). However, Kim and Woo(2016) insist that asset revaluation relieves information asymmetry. If an executive uses asset revaluation as a way to improve financial condition, auditor would regard asset revaluation as a factor which increases audit risk. Because improvement of financial condition by asset revaluation doesnt come from business improvement but from revaluation surplus, it is likely for auditor to regard asset revaluation as an executives discretionary action and to estimate audit risk high. Thus, audit report lag is likely to become longer. However, if auditor considers that asset revaluation can relieve information asymmetry, auditor would not consider asset revaluation as a factor which increases audit risk and try to provide accounting information to users earlier. Therefore, audit report lag might decrease. According to previous studies, investors consider asset revaluation positively(Kim et al., 2011 Yoo et al., 2012 Yang and Shin, 2013). Because executive prefers disclosing financial statements which include asset revaluation earlier, management discretionary report lag might decrease.The empirical results are as follows. First, we find that asset revaluation decreases audit report lag. This result suggests that auditor considers that asset revaluation relieve information asymmetry and have an incentive to decrease audit report lag. Second, there is no significant association between asset revaluation and management discretionary report lag. This result means that because auditor reduces audit report lag sufficiently even though asset revaluation relieve information asymmetry, there is no incentive for executive to reduce management discretionary report lag additionally.The contribution of this study is to provide an empirical evidence about whether auditor regards asset revaluation as a factor of which increases audit risk by examining auditors response on asset revaluation. This study also provides additional evidence about the meaning of asset revaluation by analyzing empirically on how executive behaves after external audit procedure in case of asset revaluation.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The IMI(ITI) curve of the Cr sample (XCr) exhibits a single magnetic phase transition at the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic (FM) austenitic phase with ITI SUPASUP SUBCSUB 303K. In contrast, the In sample (XIn) exhibits multiple magnetic phase transitions, including a magnetic phase transition from a FM state to weakly magnetic state at ITI SUPMSUP SUBCSUB 165K of the martensitic phase, a martensitic transition from the weakly magnetic to the FM austenite phase at ITI SUPM-ASUP 259K, and a magnetic phase transition from the FM to paramagnetic (PM) at ITI SUPASUP SUBCSUB 297K of the austenite phase. Based on the Landau theory and IMI(IHI) data measured at different temperatures, we pointed that the FM-PM phase transitions around ITI SUPASUP SUBCSUB in both samples were the second-order phase transition. Our results suggest an existence of the long-range FM interactions in the austenite phase. A small deviation from the mean-field theory of the critical exponents has been also observed pointing out an existence of the inhomogeneous magnetism that could be associated with the presence of the anti-FM interactions in these samples.

Jingangding jing, Jp. Kongchgy ) were transmitted to an unnamed sage in south India (Nanten , an abbreviation of Nan-Tenjiku ) from inside a mysterious iron stpa (tett ). A few decades later, Kkai  (774835), the founder of the Shingon school  in Japan, identified that sage as Ngrjuna, who came to be considered the third patriarch of Shingon Buddhism. Since then, that of the South Indian Iron Stupa (nanten tett ) has been an important theme in Japanese religious history in particular, it became a symbol of the transmission of esoteric knowledge in intiationconsecration rituals (kanj ) and was later transferred and adapted to newly created Buddhist rituals for Japanese deities (kami ) known as jingi kanj  or shint kanj . This article explores some of the aspects of the myth and its doctrinal implications, especially regarding the epistemology and soteriology of Esoteric Buddhism. After a brief discussion of the Iron Stupa myth from East Asian canonical sources and Kkais ideas about the tranmission of Esoteric teachings, I move on to examples of esoteric exegeses of this myth, both from the Shingon and Tendai denominationsas typical in such interpretive endeavors, the words of the myth, their meanings and their (supposed) external referents (objects and states of the world) are disassembled and recombined according to the principles of medieval Buddhist semiotics.

As the temperature increases, the thermal conductivity of the glass phase initially increases and then reaches a plateau. Afterwards, in the liquid phases, a further increase in the temperature leads to a decrease in the thermal conductivity. The thermal conduction phenomenon can be better described by considering the glass and molten oxide systems as a one-dimensional continuum. It was found that the temperature corresponding to the highest thermal conductivity lies close to the one-dimensional Debye temperature (II SUB IDI1SUB). According to phonon gas model, the variables affecting the thermal conductivity were evaluated. Below II SUB IDI1SUB, the increase in heat capacity with the temperature leads to a corresponding increase in the thermal conductivity. The heat capacity then becomes constant above II SUB IDI1SUB leading to the observed plateau in the thermal conductivity of the glass phase. After melting the glass, the decrease in thermal conductivity with increasing temperature is due to changes in sound velocity and mean free path.

Specifically, I review the IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and identify the deficiency of the present Korean National Accounting Standards regarding revenue recognition. Next, I present the potential problems due to the deficiency and, as a solution, explore the adaptability of IFRS 15, suggesting a real case.MethodologyThe revenue recognition of the Korean National Accounting Standards was introduced, borrowing the concept of IAS 8 Revenue. Several advanced countries adopted IFRS as their own national accounting standards or refer to IFRS when amending their own national accounting standards. This means that IFRS can provide the implication to a government sector as well as a private sector.FindingsIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers makes additional contribution because it makes clear accounting for variable consideration. There has been argument with regard to the timing of revenue recognition of fixedamount royalty between the practitioners and the Board of Auditing and Inspection of Korea, which is responsible for the audit of governmental bodies.ImplicationsThe reason for the disagreement is resulted from the silence in the Korean National Accounting Standards. The Standards need to be revised because this regulation is just in the beginning phase. The result of this study is expected to be useful for impending the revision of the Standards.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

This is due to the dual nature of artificial intelligence realized technological achievement and future possibilities. Therefore, artificial intelligence is uncertain despite many conceptualization attempts. At this point, the fundamental motivation for artificial intelligence to relate to humans as another subject and tool is human desire. Therefore, the problem of artificial intelligence should precede consideration of various desires projected into it. Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is a scientific and technological product, and human desire is ideological and metaphysical. In other words, a more integrated and concrete research method is required for consideration of the desire aspect projected in artificial intelligence. This is possible through narrative. Especially, it is suitable to explore human desire in that the plot of the narrative takes the working principle of desire as a driving force. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the way in which the meaning of human desire and artificial intelligence projected into artificial intelligence is transformed from the tool to other subject through the analysis of Philip K. Dicks novel Does Android Dream of Electric Sheep? Through this research, we have been able to reflect on the origins of human being and to present practical methods for restoration, harmony and integration of humanity in the coming era of artificial intelligence.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Methods  This study used a phenomenological approach of qualitative study. The participants were 10 students in 3rd year of the occupational therapy program in K Univeristy. Data information was collected by one-to-one interview and analyzed through phenomenological research method. Results  Through the interview, 20 units of meaning, 8 central meanings, and 3 themes were drew. The information collected were analyzed into three themes Learning Experiences in Online and Offline Courses, Request and Introspection of Learners on Flipped Learning. The result showed that online courses brought learners convenience and satisfaction with repeatable learning in every time and space the learner want. However, the learners appealed issues of communication and concentration due to the absence of face-to-face instruction by their instructor. For the offline courses, students showed interest in various practical classwork of sensory integration and changes in their attitude to actively engage in the practical classes. Conclusion  Flipped learning based instruction was effective for the sensory integration classes which require practice in terms of time securement and immersion in practice. The learners requested for adopting flipped learning based instruction to other subjects in occupational therapy curriculum, and introspected that they needed to actively engage in classes through the experience of flipped learning-based classes of sensory integration. The results of this study can be used as a basic resource when flipped learning classes are planned in occupational therapy education.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Decoupling peroxyacetyl nitrate from ozone in Chinese outflows observed at Gosan Climate Observatory,2017,,,"PAbstract. We measured peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and other reactive species such as O3, NO2, CO, and SO2 with aerosols including mass, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) in PM2. 5 and K in PM1. 0 at Gosan Climate Observatory in Korea (33.17 N, 126.10 E) during 19 October-6 November 2010. PAN was determined through fast gas chromatography with luminol chemiluminescence detection at 425 nm every 2 min. The PAN mixing ratios ranged from 0.1 (detection limit) to 2.4 ppbv with a mean of 0.6 ppbv. For all measurements, PAN was unusually better correlated with PM2. 5 (Pearson correlation coefficient,   0.79) than with O3 (  0.67). In particular, the O3 level was highly elevated with SO2 at midnight, along with a typical midday peak when air was transported rapidly from the Beijing areas. The PAN enhancement was most noticeable during the occurrence of haze under stagnant conditions. In Chinese outflows slowly transported over the Yellow Sea, PAN gradually increased up to 2.4 ppbv at night, in excellent correlation with a concentration increase in PM2. 5 OC and EC, PM2. 5 mass, and PM1. 0 K. The high K concentration and OC  EC ratio indicated that the air mass was impacted by biomass combustion. This study highlights PAN decoupling with O3 in Chinese outflows and suggests PAN as a useful indicator for diagnosing continental outflows and assessing their perturbation of regional air quality in northeast Asia.

Identification of radiopure titanium for the LZ dark matter experiment and future rare event searches,2017,,,"PThe LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment will search for dark matter particle interactions with a detector containing a total of 10 tonnes of liquid xenon within a double -vessel cryostat. The large mass and proximity of the cryostat to the active detector volume demand the use of material with extremely low intrinsic radioactivity. We report on the radioassay campaign conducted to identify suitable metals, the determination of factors limiting radiopure production, and the selection of titanium for construction of the LZ cryostat and other detector components. This titanium has been measured with activities of U-238(e)  1.6 mBqkg, U-238(I)  0.09 mBqkg, Th-232(e)  0.28 - 0.03 mBqkg, Th-232(I)  0.25 - 0.02 mBqkg, K-40 0.54 mBqkg, and (60) Co 0.02 mBqkg (68 CL). Such low intrinsic activities, which are some of the lowest ever reported for titanium, enable its use for future dark matter and other rare event searches. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to assess the expected background contribution from the LZ cryostat with this radioactivity. In 1,000 days of WIMP search exposure of a 5.6-tonne fiducial mass, the cryostat will contribute only a mean background of 0.160 - 0.001(stat) - 0.030(sys) counts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In order to maintain the area same the limbs sizes are slightly increased accordingly. Numerical analysis has been carried out to generate similar nature of flow condition as per IS 875 (Part III)1987 (a mean wind velocity of 10 ms) by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with help of ANSYS CFX (k-e model). The variation of mean pressure coefficients, pressure distribution over the surface, flow pattern and force coefficient are evaluated for each cases and represented graphically to understand extent of nonconformities due to such angular modifications in plan. Finally regular cross shaped building results are compared with wind tunnel results obtained from similar  shaped building study with similar flow condition. Reduction in along wind force coefficients for angular crossed shaped building, observed for various skew angles leads to develop lesser along wind force on building compared to regular crossed shaped building and square plan shaped building. Interference effect within the internal faces are observed in particular faces of building for both cases, considerably. Significant deviation is noticed in wind induced responses for angular cross building compared to regular cross shaped building for different direction wind flow.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

To do so, potential of mean force profiles and position-dependent diffusion coefficients for Na, K, Ca2, and Cl transport through a simple cyclic peptide nanotube, which is composed of 4 cyclo(D-Ala-Glu-D-Ala-Gln)2 rings, are calculated via an adaptive biasing force MD simulation method and a Baysian inferenceMonte Carlo algorithm. Among the restraints and parameters examined in this work, the radius parameter used in the flat-bottom half-harmonic restraint at the entrance and exit to channel has a great effect on the energetics of ion transport through the variation of entropy in the outside of the channel. The diffusivity profiles for the ions show a strong dependence on the damping coefficient, but the dependence on the coefficient becomes minimal inside the channel, indicating that the most important factor which affects the diffusivity of ions inside the channel is local interactions of ions with the structured channel water molecules through confinement.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The Westerners (), which seized the power with the Injo Restoration in 1623, regarded the growing power of local Sajok as a serious threat to the state authority or administrative system. They put brakes on the Sajoks move by defining the relationship between the magistrates and local people as a quasi-parent-children one and banishing those who refuse to obey the administrative orders to remote places under the Pumin goso kmjibp (the Law to Prohibit People from Lodging Complaints against Magistrates).  Under the law, local magistrates strengthened their power, while the Sajok lost much of their influence over the local community in the absence of the means to check the administrative power of magistrates. With people obeying and treating the government officials as pumogwan (parent-officials), the practice of kwanjonminbi (putting government before people) dominated the local community, and it also led to the practice of personal rule prevailing over the rule of law.

Furthermore, explores the engineering contractors (tomokchngbupja ) who promoted such projects and the process of their consolidation of power.Influential engineering contractors of colonial Chosn () concentrated in the capital city of Kyngsng (now Seoul) formed the Association for Chosn Civil Engineering and Construction (Chosn tomok knchuk hyphoe ) in 1918 in order to represent the construction industry and to expand their influence. These engineering contractors held lectures, banquets, and meetings through the association and formed close relationships with the Japanese Government-General of Korea, provincial government offices, and businesses, and they pursued profit by entering construction contracts with such officials and businessmen. Furthermore, by lobbying individuals in the Japanese cabinet () and political circles () who are related to areas in the government that manage the budget of civil engineering and construction projects, they expanded their networks. Simultaneously, the engineering contractors attempted to reform the institutions and systems that were disadvantageous through the association, and they actively petitioned in order to ensure that more civil engineering and construction budget were allocated. Furthermore, the association actively strove to secure the vested interests of the members when the number of engineering contractors increased after the late 1920s.As such, the association for Chosn Civil Engineering and Construction performed the role of oligopoly alliance, through which the influential engineering contractors shared profits based on their exclusive sense of fellowship. For the members of the association, the development of Chosn meant to make money and profits for themselves.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Satellite Bulk Tropospheric Temperatures as a Metric for Climate Sensitivity,2017,"['Climate sensitivity', 'satellite temperatures', 'volcano', 'El Niño']",,"We identify and remove the main natural perturbations (e.g. volcanic activity, ENSOs) from the global mean lower tropospheric temperatures (TLT) over January 1979 - June 2017 to estimate the underlying, potentially human-forced trend. The unaltered value is 0.155 K dec1 while the adjusted trend is 0.096 K dec1, related primarily to the removal of volcanic cooling in the early part of the record. This is essentially the same value we determined in 1994 (0.09 K dec1, Christy and McNider, 1994) using only 15 years of data. If the warming rate of 0.096 K dec1 represents the net TLT response to increasing greenhouse radiative forcings, this implies that the TLT tropospheric transient climate response (TLT at the time CO2 doubles) is 1.10  0.26 K which is about half of the average of the IPCC AR5 climate models of 2.31  0.20 K. Assuming that the net remaining unknown internal and external natural forcing over this period is near zero, the mismatch since 1979 between observations and CMIP-5 model values suggests that excessive sensitivity to enhanced radiative forcing in the models can be appreciable. The tropical region is mainly responsible for this discrepancy suggesting processes that are the likely sources of the extra sensitivity are (a) the parameterized hydrology of the deep atmosphere, (b) the parameterized heat-partitioning at the oceanatmosphere interface andor (c) unknown natural variations.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Our starting point is the analyses of M.A.K. Halliday(1985) and E.I. Shendels(1972). Traditionally, a metaphor has been viewed as a variation in the use of words, i.e. a variation in meaning. Expanding the traditional definition of a metaphor, Halliday defines grammatical metaphors as variation in the expression of meanings. Furthermore, he distinguished between two types of grammatical metaphors ideational metaphors, which have to do with alternative ways of construing reality, and interpersonal metaphors, which offer alternative possibilities of expressing modal meanings (metaphors of modality), or exchanging commands (metaphors of mood).In Russian linguistics, the term grammatical metaphor was first introduced by E.I. Shendels. According to Shendels, a lexical metaphor is based on the transfer of the name of one object to another due to some common ground. The same mechanism works in the formation of the grammatical metaphor. Thus the grammatical metaphor is a transposition of a grammatical form from one type of grammatical relations to another. As in the case of the lexical metaphor, the grammatical metaphor violates conventionality and creates new connotations. Such concept of the grammatical metaphor is closer to the traditional concept of metaphors.Hence, on the basis of previous studies, we define grammatical metaphors as a transposition of forms of the grammatical categories, i.e. the use of grammatical forms in an unusual function to create a figurative meaning. In this article, we briefly examined the conversion of such grammatical categories as person, number, gender, mood, as well as personalimpersonal and transitiveintransitive verbs.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Despite the wide use of the MAI method in the geosciences, X-band SAR has rarely been applied in MAI-based studies due to the relatively shorter decorrelation periods involved. Thus, we need to evaluate the MAI measurements from X-band SAR for the use in the geosciences. In this paper, an assessment of the MAI performance for TerraSAR-X system was carried out at the test site, Klauea Volcano, Hawaii, focusing on the Kamoamoa fissure eruption episode that occurred on March 610, 2011. The root-mean-square (RMS) errors of single MAI interferograms were 3.261.32cm and 2.950.77cm for descending and ascending datasets, respectively. Multi-stacked MAI interferograms showed reduced error levels of 1.77 and 2.04cm for descending and ascending datasets, respectively. In addition, empirical uncertainty models of the MAI measurements were generated with respect to the interferometric coherence of single- and multi-stacked MAI measurements, and these regression models enabled us to confirm the difference between the theoretical and practical accuracies of the MAI measurements.

Effective of November 2014, firms with (1) over 200 debt-equity ratio, (2) over 150 of industry average debt-toequity, and (3) less than 1 interest coverage ratio are forced to be audited by external auditors designated by the regulatory agency. This action may increase audit quality and credibility of accounting reports. However, there may be some unintended consequences, such as upward manipulation of operating income so that the interest coverage ratio could exceed 1. Based on FY 2014 consolidated financial statements prepared under K-IFRS, I select 42 firms in the interval to the immediate right of interest coverage ratio of 1 among manufacturing firms with over 200 debt-to-equity and over 150 of industry-average debt-to-equity as earnings management suspect firms. I find that suspect firms have significantly higher (performance-matched) discretionary accruals than matched sample. This implies that suspect firms could have avoided auditor designation through upward earnings manipulation using discretionary accruals. Also, evidence suggests that suspect firms may have manipulated operating income upward by classifying operating expenses into other expenses. These findings suggest that high-leverage firms tend to manipulate operating income upward in order to avoid external auditor designation, using the loophole in the current accounting regulation. The results in this paper have implications for regulatory agencies and auditors to be cautious in implementing and executing the revised policy.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Developing new automated alternation flicker using optic disc photography for the detection of glaucoma progression,2017,,,"PPurpose To evaluate a progression-detecting algorithm for a new automated matched alternation flicker (AMAF) in glaucoma patients. Methods Open-angle glaucoma patients with a baseline mean deviation of visual field (VF) test  -6 dB were included in this longitudinal and retrospective study. Functional progression was detected by two VF progression criteria and structural progression by both AMAF and conventional comparison methods using optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) photography. Progression-detecting performances of AMAF and the conventional method were evaluated by an agreement between functional and structural progression criteria. RNFL thickness changes measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were compared between progressing and stable eyes determined by each method. Results Among 103 eyes, 47 (45.6), 21 (20.4), and 32 (31.1) eyes were evaluated as glaucoma progression using AMAF, the conventional method, and guided progression analysis (GPA) of the VF test, respectively. The AMAF showed better agreement than the conventional method, using GPA of the VF test (k0.337 P0.001 and k0.124 P0.191, respectively).

With this standard, however, the criminal courts in Korea have widened the meaning of indecent act by including victims positions as well.This article, through a comparative research on the recent legal discussion and newly adopted sexual assault codes in the United States and the U.K,, contours the newly tried approach in interpretingsexual touching in the two countries where the perpetrators touch issexualwhen a reasonable person perceives the act as being sexual from a perpetrators objective position.

First of all, the Pierson-Moskowitz ocean spectrum was used to generate the rough sea surfaces. Then the relationship between the significant wave heights, root-mean-square(RMS) heights and wind speed was derived by estimating the significant wave heights and RMS heights of the generated sea surfaces according to various wind speeds, and compared the derived relationship with other measurement data sets. The reflection coefficients of the sea surfaces were calculated by using a numerical method(the moment method). Then, the numerical results were compared with Ament model, PO(Physical Optics) model, GO(Geometrical Optics) model and B-M(Brown-Miller) model for various roughness conditions(wind speed) and incidence angles. It was found that the Ament model is not accurate except for a very low roughness conditions(khrms0.4, k is wavenumber and hrms is RMS height).

The K-LSA showed significant correlations with the FAC (r0.848, p0.01), FIM (r0.765, p0.01), mobility category of the FIM (r0.764, p0.01), GDS (r-0.657, p0.01), and EQ-5D (r0.506, p0.01).Conclusion This study suggests that the practical life space of post-stroke patients, assessed by the K-LSA, has a significant correlation with patients functional mobility, independence in daily activity, quality of life, and depression.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Comparison Between Korean Version of Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly and International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form in Evaluation of Frailty Phenotype,2017,"['Frail elderly', 'Cohort studies', 'Exercise', 'Motor activity', 'Physical activity']",,"Background Evaluation of frailty in older people requires assessment of their physical activity level. The Korean version of the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (K-PASE) questionnaire is more comprehensive, yet it can be time-consuming and costly to administer on a large scale. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form, which is simpler and free of charge, may replace the K-PASE for defining the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) frailty phenotype. Methods We analyzed data from 160 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 75 years) who were administered both the K-PASE and IPAQ short form questionnaires as part of the assessments in the Aging Study of Pyeongchang Rural Area. We compared agreements between the 2 physical activity questionnaires and between the CHS frailty phenotype defined using the K-PASE and IPAQ short form. Correlations between each CHS frailty phenotype definition and common geriatric syndromes were assessed. Results The physical activity level measured using the K-PASE correlated modestly with the level measured using the IPAQ short form (correlation coefficient, 0.250 p0.001). However, the agreement was substantially higher between the CHS frailty phenotype based on the K-PASE and the definition based on the IPAQ short form (Cohen kappa, 0.625 p0.001). Both frailty phenotype definitions were positively correlated with most geriatric conditions. Conclusion The simpler IPAQ short form may replace the more comprehensive K-PASE for assessing CHS frailty phenotype in older people. Our results should inform frailty assessment in research and clinical care settings.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Bhabhas ideas of the translational space of hybridity. It is true that some critics rightly criticize Bhabhas theory as having limitation in considering the present time in which national cultures are being weakened or incorporated into the culture logic of transnational capitals. Nevertheless, Bhabhas third space of hybridity can be very useful in correcting the mistaken logic of cultural imperialism, which states that the culture of the center will dominate that of the periphery. Bhabhas idea of the translational space of hybridity is to rethink the unconscious structure of postcolonial discourses and deconstruct the one-sided domination by colonizers within colonialist discourses.The young heroine, Selina in Brown Girl, Brownstones, confronts the cultural conflicts between Barbados and New York and loses her identity. As she matures, she tries to establish her own self-identity as a Caribbean-American and a black female living in America through understanding her parents generation and fusing the two distinct cultures. The cure for Tayos broken self caused by cultural collisions between the White and Native American in Ceremony is to realize cultural hybridity and to learn to adapt and alter ancient traditions to fit modern situations. Silko asserts that the tribal cultures and values may be adapted and transformed by cultural exchanges and the hybridization of different cultures. In Lees On Such a Full Sea, the future of human life doesnt lie in the world of Charter District, which has absolute wealth and economic affluence, but in the translational space of hybridity which is opened, has boundless imagination itself, and produces new meaning like an impromptu and spontaneous mural painting. These three novels provide the readers with the opportunities to explore various manifestations of intercultural, interethnic and interclass dynamics.In conclusion, this paper tries to appropriate a positive sense of Bhabhas ideas of the translational space of hybridity, to investigate the protagonists reactions to racial prejudice, different cultures, and ruling class, and to examine those protagonists attempts to achieve harmony with other races, cultures and classes in that space. Marshall, Silko and Lee present the possibility of reconciliation and coexistence among different races, ethnic cultures, and socioeconomic classes in terms of cultural hybridity.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The yogic physiology of hahayoga reflected in Indian mythology, The churning of the ocean of milk(Krodamathana) myth of Viu Pura, is a review of the concept of haha, which means the sun energy() and the moonenergy(), the cosmic dual forces. In this mythology, Viu has a dynamic sovereignty and a special character as a master of life-energy(pra, Qi, ).  As the sattvic functions of three guas(sattva, rajas, tamas), Viu is the centerpiece of the interdynamic harmony of the left and right energies. In human body, when rajas(the dynamic energy of right side ) and tamas(the static energy of left side ) are balanced with, the sattvic energy appear to yogi. This is what Vishnus properties have been revealed as a principle of yogic physiology through mythology.  The churning of the ocean of milk myth which based on Viu, is carrying out the course of yoga implementation. With the help of Viu, Devas gets the amta which is the elixir of life, the eternal immortality. The getting of miraculous medicine is the important course of yogic practice. Were going to be able to use the rivalry function of right and left energy by yoga. Devas and Asuras are left and right energies in our inside.  The harmonization of Devas and Asuras is achieved through Viu and the amta are raised by rotating of Mandara mountain. The center of Mandara mountain is the center of the body, which is connected to the rotating cakras. By the rotation of cakra and the penetration of Suumn n, The yogi achieves the yogic achievement of immortality.  In The unity(marriage) of iva and Prvat myth, sexual energy(akti) is the root of the Creation. At the same time, it is the subject of tapas(asceticism). This myth in which Brahmans expansion of cosmos confronts with ivas sexual asceticism shows the stage of yoga achieved by the perfect control over sexual desire. iva has been symbolized as the success to the ultimate achievement which Yogi should reach through the restraint of sexual energy(akti), namely, Brahmacarya(chastity). Yogis sexual desire must be fully controlled over.  Thus, These myths symbolize the most basic physiology of yoga.

It will provide means for new growth and development through innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence, bio-technology, robot-engineering, Internet of Things, 3D printings, and fintech that will lead to historic social changes.Part II of this Article defines the fintech industry and briefly looks into adequate stance for regulation of fintech industry generally. Fintech is a fusion of technology used in providing financial services and informational communication technology. It could be a discrimination to exempt or mitigate fintech firms from rational ordinary regulation only for they apply fintech itself. Whereas it is sometimes essential for the success of the fintech firms to deregulate irrational banning hurdles, the fintech firms should innovate to break through traditional financial service industry into success.And in Part , I shift my focus into the specialized study of legal issues including the separation of banking and commerce on the point of view with the online bank such as the K-Bank that was recently approved by the Financial Services Commission. Online banks are exactly kind of banks so that the principle of separation of banking and commerce should be applied to them naturally. If the principle does not apply to online banks for certain circumstantial causes, then I concern whether the principle will collapse in the context of traditional banks in the ends.Part  analyses the adequacy of regulation of crowdfunding in Korea, looking into its history and the present condition in the U.S. The Korea Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act (amended on July 24, 2015) introduced the equity crowdfunding as online small-sum investment brokerage. This is the first legislation of crowdfunding in Korean legal system. In the crowdfunding, the entrepreneur of small start-up can raise capital from many investors through the Internet platforms, particularly by using social networks. And there is a need to inform investors about the projects so as to assure the crowd decide rationally as a collective intelligence. So I feel that more freedom to advertise or investment recommendation for the online small-sum investment broker or the issuer should be allowed through deregulation.In Part , I found that the payments processing and peer-to-peer money transfer service by fintech firms on one hand need regulation for the Cyber safety, but on the other deregulation of small-sum peer-to-peer foreign money transfer services for more competition in this area. Lastly, Part  concludes by offering positive policy suggestions that follow from my analysis.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The SHS reaction was performed to obtain Al-10TiC slurry first, which subsequently wasmixed with Al-Ti melt to obtain Al-5Ti-0.2C master alloy. By means of the proposed method, the process temperaturewas lowered to 1323 K. According to the results, in the case of improved SHS approach, the Al temperatureafter the onset of reaction increases by 90-100 K more than in the case of conventional preparation route,providing better kinetic conditions for TiC formation. As a result, at 1323 K production temperature, the averagecarbide size increases by 100 as compared to the conventionally produced refiner, which is claimed to be a reasonfor the improved refining performance of master alloy.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Methods Pediatric patients newly diagnosed with epilepsy (n90 61 boys and 29 girls mean age, 9.1pm3.4years) were enrolled. All patients were evaluated with the Korean ADHD rating scale (K-ARS)-IV before treatment with lamotrigine and after doses had been administered. The mean interval of ADHD testing was approximately 12.3 months. The initial dosage of lamotrigine was 1 mgkgday (maximum 25 mgday for the first 2 weeks), and increased by 1 mgkg every 2 weeks until titrated up to 7 mgkgday (or maximum 200 mgday). Results The mean ADHD test score of the 90 subjects was 17.0pm1.8 at baseline. It was slightly reduced to 15.6pm1.7 after lamotrigine monotherapy (P0.01). Prior to treatment, a total of 31 patients (34.4) met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision, Of these 31 patients, 27 (87.1) had significantly improved ADHD scores with lamotrigine monotherapy (28.0pm1.6 reduced to 18.1pm2.6, P0.001). Among these 27 patients, 25 (92.6) showed normalized electroencephalogram (EEG) and 26 (96.3) achieved total freedom from seizures within 12 months of the initiation of lamotrigine monotherapy. Conclusion The results from our study show that lamotrigine had a positive effect in pediatric epilepsy patients by reducing ADHD symptoms, preventing seizures, and normalizing EEG. However, further research is required to determine whether lamotrigine is efficacious against ADHD symptoms independent of its effects on epileptic seizures.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

To 15 children with Downs syndrome (mean CA 97) and 15 typically developing children on receptive language age, the following tests were administered K-WPPSI (2001), Picture Vocabulary Test (Kim et al., 1995), Oral and Speech Motor Control Protocol for total oral functional score (Robbins et al., 1987), DDK and Assessment of Phonology and Articulation for Children (APAC, Kim et al., 2007) for PCC and speech intelligibility. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for the total oral functional score, PCC and DDK of each group. The statistical analysis showed that there is no significant difference in total functional score and DDK when IQ was controlled. There was a significant correlation between total oral functional score and PCC in the Downs syndrome group and a significant correlation between total oral functional score and intelligibility in the Downs syndrome group whether IQ was controlled or not. The findings suggest that both cognitive ability and overall oral motor function need to be considered for the intervention to enhance PCC or speech intelligibility of children with Downs syndrome.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Mobile Application based on Image Processing and a Proportion for Food Intake Measuring,2017,"['Food intake', 'Image-based volumetric algorithm', 'Image segmentation', 'Mobile application', '3D estimation']",,"In the paper, we propose a new reliable technique for measuring food intake based on image automatically without user intervention. First, food and bowl image before and after meal is obtained by user. The food and the bowl are divided into each region by the K-means clustering, Otsu algorithm, Morphology, etc. And the volume of food is measured by a proportional expression based on the information of the container such as its entrance diameter, depth, and bottom diameter. Finally, our method calculates the volume of the consumed food by the difference between before and after meal. The proposed technique has higher accuracy than existing method for measuring food intake automatically. The experiment result shows that the average error rate is up to 7 for three types of containers. Computer simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm is a convenient and accurate method of measuring the food intake.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Unsupervised clustering algorithms, hierarchicaland k-means clustering analysis, and color visualizations of CYP2D6 activity were performedon a subset of 130 subjects. A total of 23 different genotypes were identified, five of which wereobserved in one subject. Phenotype classifications were based on the means, medians, and standarddeviations of the log MR values for each genotype. Color visualization was used to display the meanand median of each genotype as different color intensities. Cutoff values were determined usingreceiver operating characteristic curves from the k-means analysis, and the data were validated inthe remaining subset of 71 subjects. Using the two highest silhouette values, the selected numbers ofclusters were three (the best) and four. The findings from the two clustering algorithms were similarto those of other studies, classifying 55 as a lowest activity group and genotypes containingduplicated alleles (i.e., CYP2D612N) as a highest activity group. The validation of the k-meansclustering results with data from the 71 subjects revealed relatively high concordance rates 92.8and 73.9 in three and four clusters, respectively.

By using the ensemble mean of five model results, future changes in climate zones and four extreme temperature events of South Korea were investigated according to Kppen-Trewarthas classification criteria. The four temporal periods of historical (1981-2005), early future (2021-2040), middle future (2041-2070), and late future (2071-2100) were defined to examine future changes. The analysis domain was divided into 230 administrative districts of South Korea. In historical (1981-2005) period, the subtropical zones are only dominant in the southern coastal regions and Jeju island, while those tend to expand in the future periods. Depending on the RCP scenarios, the more radiative forcing results in the larger subtropical zone over South Korea in the future. The expansion of the subtropical zone in metropolitan areas is more evident than that in rural areas. In addition, the enlargement of the subtropical zone in coastal regions is more prominent than that of in inland regions. Particularly, the subtropical climate zone for the late future period of RCP8.5 scenario is significantly dominant in most South Korea. All scenarios show that cold related extreme temperature events are expected to decrease and hot related extreme temperature events to increase in late future. This study can be utilized by administrative districts for the strategic plan of responses to future climate change.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

This study aimed to confirm the cultural equivalence, reliability, and validity of the Korean version of Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (K-FCRI). We conducted a forwardbackward translation of the English version FCRI to Korean version through meticulous process including transcultural equivalence test. The psychometric property of the K-FCRI was then validated in 444 survivors from cancers at various sites. The Korean translation was accepted well by participants. There was a good cultural equivalence between the Korean version and the English version of FCRI. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the original seven-factor structure with slightly insufficient level of goodness-of-fit indices (comparative fit index  0.900, non-normed fit index  0.893, root mean square error of approximation  0.060). The K-FCRI had high internal consistency (  0.85 for total scale and   0.770.87 for subscales) and test-retest reliability (r  0.90 for total scale and r  0.540.84 for subscales). The K-FCRI had significant correlations with the Korean version of Fear of Progression Questionnaire, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Version 3.0, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Fatigue Severity Score, supporting the good construct validity and psychometric properties of K-FCRI.

The objective of this study is to explore the distribution of the participants roles and to examine the psychopathology associated with these roles among middle school students. Methods In a cross- sectional study, 490 middle school students completed the Participant Role Questionnaire (PRQ) for classifying the participants roles in a bullying situation. The Korean- Youth Self Report (K- YSR), Revised Children s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), Rosenberg Self- Esteem Scale (RSE) and Parent Adolescent Communication Inventory (PACI) were also included to evaluate the psychopathology of the students. Results The distribution rates of the bully, assistant, reinforcer, defender and outsider groups were 4.1, 3.1, 5.3, 53.7, and 32.0, respectively. Among the syndrome scales of K- YSR, almost each items and the total scores (p0.049), RCMAS (p0.000), PACI (p0.000), and RSE (p0.000) were significantly different among all group. The average scores on the K- YSR and RCMAS were the highest in the assistant and reinforcer groups. Conclusion The assistant and reinforcer groups showed more severe psychopathologies. This means that they suffered from more difficulties than the other groups. Therefore, they need more intensive therapeutic interventions. Except for the defender group, who prevented bullying, the outsider group was the largest group. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that can change outsiders to defenders should be employed for the prevention of bullying in adolescents",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

First, we obtain the dictionary by online dictionary learning and the compressed images. The dictionary is then modified by the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature descriptor and K-means cluster. Second, an adaptive residual threshold for orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is proposed and used for sparse coding by combining blind image blocking assessment.

The subjects of this study were 543 first and second grade students in high school located in Gyeonggi-do. They were assessed by the Scale for Measuring Family Strength(SMFS), Korean Adolescents Basic Psychological Need Scale(KABPNS), Korean version of the Satisfaction With Life Scale(K-SWLS), and Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule(PANAS). The collected data was analyzed using the Pearsons correlation analysis, and hierarchical regression analysis by SPSS 23.0 statistical program. And the results which were significant were analyzed graphically and simple slope analysis was conducted. The results of this study can be summarized as follows. First, adolescents perception of family strength, basic psychological need and subjective well-being showed significant positive correlation. Second, the moderating effects of the total score of basic psychological need and its sub-factor(autonomy, competence) on the relationship between adolescents perception of family strength and subjective well-being were significant. In contrast, the moderating effect of the relatedness on the relationship between adolescents perception of family strength and subjective well-being was not significant. This results mean that adolescents in low levels of the basic psychological need and its sub-factor(autonomy, competence) can be attributed to low levels of subjective well-being, even though the family strength is high. In conclusion, this study confirmed the important role of family strength and basic psychological need to increase subjective well-being.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

However, it is difficult for scientists to select a suitable set of resources since those resources are comprised of various characteristics. Therefore, classification is needed to support the effective utilization of cloud resources. Thus, a dynamic resource clustering method is needed to reflect the characteristics of the application that scientists want to execute. This paper proposes a resource clustering analysis method that takes into account the characteristics of an application in a hybrid cloud environment. The resource clustering analysis applies a Self-Organizing Map and K-means algorithm to dynamically cluster similar resources.

Little is known about the measurement of decisional conflict, and existing measures are not suitable for all contexts. In this study, psychometric properties of the Decisional Conflict Scale, which was translated for the first time into Korean Korean version of DCS (K-DCS), were examined.Methods A sample of 273 community-dwelling elders was surveyed (mean age 77.26 years 80.2 women). Internal consistency reliability and stability reliability were tested by calculating Cronbach a and Pearsons correlation coefficients. Exploratory factor analysis and logistic regression analyses were performed to test validity.Results Reliability of the K-DCS was acceptable with Cronbach a .87 test-retest correlation r  .76. Factor analysis showed a two-factor structure with nine items informedvalues clarity and uncertainty. Concordance between K-DCS and the four treatment directives was significant (kappa values .78). Controlling for age and gender, those with decision implementation were more likely to implement their decisions on tube feeding (odds ratio  5.15, p  .033) and hospice care (odds ratio  2.83, p  .017).Conclusion The K-DCS appears to be a valid measure to evaluate decisional conflict about advance directives in community-dwelling Korean older adults.

The final result is to examine how the degree of matching affects tax avoidance. The methodology is based on multiple regression analysis using financial data from 2011, when the KIFRS was fully adopted, to 2015, which was recently announced. We find as follows.The higher the nontax costs measured by capital costs, the lower the tax costs in terms of minimizing total costs. The following are the result of the control of the endogeneity between the tax avoidance and the cost of capital. When the cost of debt or equity is high, the manager shows significant tax avoidance in order to lower the tax burden(tax cost). In other words, if the cost of capital is high, tax avoidance is relatively high in order to lower the tax costs.The higher the degree of matching, the higher the quality of earnings and the lower the capital cost, which is the nontax costs. To minimize the total costs, nontax costs affect tax costs. For firms with a high degree of matching, the nontaxable costs are lowered. If the nontaxable costs are lowered, the tax burden(tax costs) increases. A high tax burden(tax cost) means that the degree of tax avoidance is relatively low. Therefore, the degree of matching has a negative impact on tax avoidance through the tradeoff between nontax costs and tax costs.The results of this study show that firms with a high degree of matching do not tax avoidance unreasonably in order to lower the tax costs(tax burden) because the nontax costs are lowered. Therefore, the degree of matching provides additional information on tax avoidance as well as information on nontax costs.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Distribution of CNTs as reinforcements may be uniform or functionally graded (FG). The equivalent material properties of the composite media are obtained according to a refined rule of mixtures which contains efficiency parameters. To account for the large deformations, von Krmn type of geometrical nonlinearity is included into the formulation. The matrix representation of the governing equations is obtained according to the Ritz method where the basic shape functions are written in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials. Time dependency of the problem is eliminated by means of the Galerkin method and the resulting nonlinear eigenvalue problem is solved employing a direct displacement control approach. Results are obtained for completely clamped and completely simply supported plates. Results are first validated for the especial cases of FG-CNTRC and cross-ply laminated plates.

Patients were divided into two groups according to the steep axis the temporal and superior groups. Anterior, posterior and total corneal SIA (simulated keratometry Sm K, posterior keratometry PK and total corneal power TCP respectively) were measured using autorefractive keratometry (ARK) and dual Scheimpflug imaging before and after surgery.Results There were 61 eyes with temporal incision and 23 eyes with superior incision. The mean SIA was larger in the superior incision group than in the temporal incision group according to ARK, Sm K, PK and TCP (p  0.05). There were no significant cylindrical changes in ARK in the temporal incision group, however, there was a significant decrease in the superior incision group before and after the operation (p  0.05). Change in the amount and axis of PK before and after operation were not significantly different, for both incision groups. There was a significant correlation between post-operative TCP and both pre-operative ARK and Sm K for both groups. However, there was no correlation between post-operative TCP and pre-operative PK. In all patients, when pre-operative PK was more than 0.5 D, SIA-ARK, SIA-Sm K and SIA-TCP were all significantly larger than when pre-operative PK was less than 0.5 D, whereas SIA-PK was not. When pre-operative PK was more than 0.5 D, there were no significant differences in SIA-ARK, SIA-Sm K, SIA-PK or SIA-TCP in the temporal incision group. However, SIA-ARK was significantly largerin the superior incision group.Conclusions There was no significant cylindrical change in PK before and after operation in both the temporal and superior incision groups.

This paper proposes the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as an offloading strategy of cloudlet to data centers where each task is represented as a particle during the process. The collected tasks are classified using K-means clustering on the cloudlet before applying PSO in order to minimize the number of particles and to locate the best data center for a specific task, instead of considering all tasks during the PSO process. Simulation results show that the proposed PSO excels in choosing data centers with respect to energy consumption, while it has accumulated a little more processing time compared to the other approaches.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Among various biofuels, biodiesel has several advantages such as less emission of air pollutants and higher cetane values compared to diesel oil.Demand for biodiesel in Korea is increasing that leads to higher dependence on the imported feedstocks. Therefore, it is important to utilize the waste materials collected domestically for biodiesel production. Food waste oil collected in waste treatment facility has not been used for biodiesel production due to high free fatty contents in the oil.In this work, biodiesel conversion of food waste oil by Amberlyst 15 was studied. Synthetic and actual food waste oils have been used in the study. First, the effects of the major operating parameters including reaction temperature, methanol to oil molar ratio and catalyst loading on the conversion rates and yields were determined with synthetic waste oil.Kinetic modelling work was also done to determine the activation energy of the reaction. From the work, optimization reaction conditions were determined to be 383K, 1 26.1 for methanol molar ratio to oil, 10 wt. for catalyst loading and 360 min for reaction time. Activation energy of the reaction is determined to be 29.75 kJmol, lower than those reported in the previous works. So the solid catalyst, Amberlyst 15, was more efficient for esterification than the solid catalysts employed in the other works. Agitation rates have the negligible effects on the conversion rates and yields. With the identified optimization conditions, conversion of the actual food waste oil was also carried out. The esterification yield of actual food waste oil in 60 min was 13 lower than that of synthetic waste oil but the final yields in 240 min were similar each other, 98.12 for synthetic oil and 97.62 for actual waste oil.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

One approach of those models tries to detect dimensions that distinguish between groups well and the number of the detected dimensions is typically smaller than p. In such models, the number of dimensions is important because the prediction and visualization of data and can be usually determined by the K-fold cross-validation (CV). However, in sparse data scenarios, the CV is not reliable for determining the optimal number of dimensions since there can be only a few observations for each fold.

Background In the last 5 years, 97.5 of the causes of ship collision occurred at the sea was caused by human factors. However, the rate of marine accidents due to human error has not been reduced yet. Experiments and researches on the ship operators using the ships in actual operation are rarely performed. Method Using two K.C.G Ships on the sea, the ship measured by 30 persons who are the subject of the ship (ship operator) when both ships approach and the relative distance gradually decreases in four encounter situations, perceived ship collision risk (PSCR) data were analyzed by statistical analysis. Results The age and boarding career of the ship operator in the situation of ship collision risks encountered a negative impact on perceived collision risk in all four opposing encounter situations S1 (000circ), S2 (045circ), S3 (090circ) and S4 (135circ) respectively. That is, the higher the age of the ship operator, the lower the perceived risk of collision and the lower the age, the higher the risk of collision. Also, there was a difference between the average of group A (2030 years) and group B (4050 years) according to age of the ship operators at 000circ, 045circ and 090circ and there was no difference at 135circ. The mean difference of the experience of boarding career was also significantly different between group A (less than 4 years) and group B (more than 5 years), but there was no significant difference at 135circ. Conclusion The results showed that age and boarding career of the ship operators had negative impact on perceived collision risk and there was a difference in perceived risk of collision according to age and abundance of boarding career. As a result, by focusing on the ship operators who are in the age group of 2030 years old and have less than 4 years of experience in boarding the ship. It is expected that the effect of prevention of marine accidents can be expected by avoiding collision avoidance.

Here, we present the first application of source localization in the field of sleep spindle in mouse brain. The spatial distribution of cortical potential was obtained by high density EEG and then the anterior and posterior sleep spindles were classified based on the K-mean clustering algorithm. To solve the forward problem, a realistic geometry brain model was produced based on boundary element method (BEM) using mouse MRI. Then, we applied four different source estimation algorithms (minimum norm, eLORETA, sLORETA, and LORETA) to estimate the spatial location of equivalent dipole source of sleep spindles. The estimated sources of anterior and posterior spindles were plotted in a cine-mode that revealed different topographic patterns of spindle propagation.

This optimistic prospect is still valid, but consumers responses to smartwatch are quite different from market expectations. This study amis 1) to derive consumer types based on the perception of benefits and costs of smartwatch, 2) to analyze the differences among consumer types, and 3) to identify factors that affect consumers resistance and intention to adopt smartwatches. For this purpose, data was collected using a self-administrated online survey of 528 consumers and analyzed the data through k-means cluster analysis, ANOVA, and multiple regression analysis.The major findings of this study are as follows.First, the result of cluster analysis identified four distinctive consumer types according to the levels of perceived benefits and costs of smartwatch Indifferent type(12.7), cost-centered type(23.1), benefit-centered type(40.7), and Ambivalent type(23.5). There was a significant difference in smartwatch benefits and costs perception among the consumer types.Second, antecedent variables including income level, technology readiness (TR), performance ambiguity, and expectation of new product emergence among consumer types were all significantly different. The perception of four sub-dimensions of TR was lowest in the indifferent type and the highest in the ambivalent type. Comparing the cost-centered type with the benefit-centered type, the innovativeness was high in the benefit-centered type, and the discomfort and anxiety were high in the cost-centered type. The performance ambiguity was significantly lower in the benefit-centered type than in the other three types, and the expectation of new product emergence was the lowest in the indifferent type and the highest in the ambivalent type.Third, there was a significant difference in the level of innovation resistance and intention to adopt smartwatch by consumer type. The ambivalent type, which perceives both the benefits and the costs of smartwatch as high, showed low innovation resistance and the highest intention to adopt smartwatch.Fourth, using a multiple regression analysis, this study identified variables that impact the consumers innovation resistance and intention to adopt smartwatch. Consumers innovativeness and expectation of new product emergence influenced innovation resistance negatively but influenced intention to adopt smartwatch positively. On other hand, technology anxiety influenced innovation resistance positively but influenced intention to adopt smartwatch negatively. Technology discomfort and performance ambiguity only significantly and positively affected consumer resistance to smartwatch. The intention to adopt smartwatch of the ambivalent type was significantly higher than that of the benefit-centered type, indicating the importance of ambivalent consumer group as potential user of smartwatch.This study is different from the previous studies in that it analyzes not only consumers positive responses to smartwatch such as perceived benefits and adoption but also negative responses such as perceived costs and innovation resistance, and investigates the relationship between antecedent and outcome variables.

Differential number count is estimated in flux range between 3.5 and 9.0 mJy after applying various corrections derived by imaging simulations, which is consistent with previous studies. For detailed study on the individual sources, we select three sources with more reliable measurements (SN  4.5), and construct their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from optical to far-infrared band. Redshift distribution of the sources ranges from 0.36 to 3.28, and their physical parameters are extracted using MAGPHYS model, which yield infrared luminosity LIR  1011.3-1013.4  Lodot, star formation rate SFR  101.3-103.2 Modotyr-1 and dust temperature TD  30-53 K. We investigate the correlation between LIR and TD, which appears to be consistent with previous studies.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Analysis of dimensions and shapes of maxillary and mandibular dental arch in Korean young adults,2017,"['Dental arch dimension', 'Dental arch shape', 'Dental arch form', 'Korean adult']",,"PURPOSE. The aim of this study was to investigate dental arch dimensions and to classify arch shape in Korean young adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The sample included 50 Koreans with age ranging from 24 to 32 years. Maxillary and mandibular casts were fabricated using irreversible hydrocolloid and type III dental stones. Incisor-canine distance, incisor-1st molar distance, incisor-2nd molar distance, intercanine distance, inter-1st molar distance, and inter-2nd molar distance in both the maxillary and mandibular arch were measured using a three-dimensional measuring device. The dental arch was classified into three groups using five ratios from the measured values by the K-means clustering method. The data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS. Arch lengths (IM2D, incisal-2nd molar distance) were 44.13 mm in the maxilla and 40.40 mm in the mandible. Arch widths (M2W, inter 2nd molar width) were 64.12 mm in the maxilla and 56.37 mm in the mandible. Distribution of the dental arch form was mostly ovoid shape (maxilla 52 and mandible 56), followed by the V-shape and the U-shape. The arch width for the U-shape was broader than for the other forms. CONCLUSION. This study establishes new reference data for dental arch dimensions for young Korean adults. The most common arch form is the ovoid type in the maxilla and mandible of Koreans. Clinicians should be aware of these references and classify arch type before and during their dental treatment for effective and harmonized results in Koreans.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

As a result, infant motivation types were classified into 3 clusters. As for the motivation types of cluster 1, internal motivation was significantly outstanding while external motivation and internal motivation were quite insignificant. Internal motivation of cluster 2 was as low as a half of those of cluster 1 and cluster 3. External motivation and no-motivation as well were lower than those of cluster 3. Internal motivation of cluster 3 was similar to that of cluster 1, but the level of no-motivation was the highest. Accordingly, in this study, cluster 1 is called the high internal motivation type, cluster 2 the low motivation type, and cluster 3 the complex motivation type, respectively, to represent the attributes of the clusters. As a result of analyzing the differences among the cluster types depending on the sex and age, it was determined that there was no significant difference depending on the sex and age of the infant. As a case study on the clusters of motivation types, anecdote recordings were conducted for 12 weeks and analyzed systematically. As a result, it was determined that young children in the high internal motivation type cluster were seeking self-satisfaction and satisfying their internal curiosity while young children in the low motivation type were following the instruction of others and expected extrinsic rewards. Young children in the complex motivation type cluster were sensitive to external stimuli and would act at a moderate level.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

On the one hand, KOTRA has presented the concept of the business Korean Wave for the purpose of take-off from the economic Korean Wave to the business Korean Wave.  The total amount of exports of industries related to the Korean Wave recently surveyed by region accounts for USD 5,460,000,000. Like this, the Korean Wave of popular culture products manufactured in Korea is sweeping over the whole world beyond Asia. It has revolved around dramas, films, K-pop and then extended to the living culture focused on food culture. Naturally, the question could exist as to whether or not the diffusion of the Korean Wave is the global phenomenon or whether or not the Korean Wave can continue to last in the future. But the Korean popular culture, which had long belonged to the unknown cultural backwater from the dimension of cultural exchanges in modern and contemporary world history, has exercised this influence over the world for the recent 20 years, which would an important research subject for researchers.  Analytic articles of this Korean Wave have been presented later compared to the beginning of the Korean Wave, but 526 articles are found to have been presented in important academic journals up to 2013. For the purpose of writing this paper, an attempt was made to search the Korean Wave only in one site of RISS as of May, 2017. As a result, it brought about 2390 theses and dissertations, 4686 papers in domestic academic journals, 2638 books and 103 research reports. In addition, it brought 45 articles in English and 23 books in English about the Korean Wave.

Validation of the Korean Version of the Scale for Outcomes in Parkinsons Disease-Autonomic,2017,"['Autonomic', 'Parkinson’s disease', 'Korean version', 'Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson’s disease-Autonomic']",,"Objective Autonomic symptoms are commonly observed in patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) and often limit the activities of daily living. The Scale for Outcomes in Parkinsons disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT) was developed to evaluate and quantify autonomic symptoms in PD. The goal of this study was to translate the original SCOPA-AUT, which was written in English, into Korean and to evaluate its reliability and validity for Korean PD patients. Methods For the translation, the following processes were performed forward translation, backward translation, expert review, pretest of the pre-final version and development of the final Korean version of SCOPA-AUT (K-SCOPA-AUT). In total, 127 patients with PD from 31 movement disorder clinics of university-affiliated hospitals in Korea were enrolled in this study. All patients were assessed using the K-SCOPA-AUT and other motor, non-motor, and quality of life scores. Test-retest reliability for the K-SCOPA-AUT was assessed over a time interval of 1014 days. Results The internal consistency and reliability of the K-SCOPA-AUT was 0.727 as measured by the mean Cronbachs -coefficient. The test-retest correlation reliability was 0.859 by the Guttman split-half coefficient. The total K-SCOPA-AUT score showed a positive correlation with other non-motor symptoms the Korean version of non-motor symptom scale (KNMSS), activities of daily living (Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale part II) and quality of life the Korean version of Parkinsons Disease Quality of Life 39 (K-PDQ39). Conclusion The K-SCOPA-AUT had good reliability and validity for the assessment of autonomic dysfunction in Korean PD patients. Autonomic symptom severities were associated with many other motor and non-motor impairments and influenced quality of life.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Uncertainty Assessment Relative versus Absolute Point Dose Measurement for Patient Specific Quality Assurance in EBRT,2017,"['Uncertainty', 'EBRT', 'IMRT', 'Point dose', 'QA']",,"Verification of dose distribution is an essential part of ensuring the treatment planning systems (TPS) calculated dose will achieve the desired outcome in radiation therapy. Each measurement have uncertainty associated with it. It is desirable to reduce the measurement uncertainty. A best approach is to reduce the uncertainty associated with each step of the process to keep the total uncertainty under acceptable limits. Point dose patient specific quality assurance (QA) is recommended by American Association of Medical Physicists (AAPM) and European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) for all the complex radiation therapy treatment techniques. Relative and absolute point dose measurement methods are used to verify the TPS computed dose. Relative and absolute point dose measurement techniques have a number of steps to measure the point dose which includes chamber cross calibration, electrometer reading, chamber calibration coefficient, beam quality correction factor, reference conditions, influences quantities, machine stability, nominal calibration factor (for relative method) and absolute dose calibration of machine. Keeping these parameters in mind, the estimated relative percentage uncertainty associated with the absolute point dose measurement is 2.1 (k1). On the other hand, the relative percentage uncertainty associated with the relative point dose verification method is estimated to 1.0 (k1). To compare both point dose measurement methods, 13 head and neck (HN) IMRT patients were selected. A point dose for each patient was measured with both methods. The average percentage difference between TPS computed dose and measured absolute relative point dose was 1.4 and 1 respectively. The results of this comparative study show that while choosing the relative or absolute point dose measurement technique, both techniques can produce similar results for HN IMRT treatment plans. There is no statistically significant difference between both point dose verification methods based upon the t-test for comparing two means.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Alterations of White Matter Integrity in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Tract-Based Analysis Using TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy,2017,['Diffusion Tensor Imaging White Matter Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease'],,"Purpose To investigate structural brain changes and their relationship with cognitive function by determining the alterations of white matter integrity and changes in hippocampal volume that occur during chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Materials and Methods Diffusion tensor images and 3D-T1 MR images were acquired in 13 male nonhypoxemic COPD patients and 13 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Global probabilistic tractography was used to assess a total of 18 major tracts. We examined the association between the hippocampal volume and diffusivity parameters of white matter tracts.Results A significant difference in diffusion parameters between groups was identified for 11 white matter bundles (p  0.05). No association was demonstrated between the normalized hippocampus volume and diffusion parameters among the participants. Significant associations between Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (KMMSE) scores and diffusivities were found for six tracts (p  0.05). Of note, the mean diffusivity (MD) and redial diffusivity (RD) of the left superior longitudinal fasciculus parietal segment showed a significant negative correlation with the K-MMSE score (MD r  -0.623, p  0.001 RD r  -0.408, p  0.048).Conclusion Altered white matter integrity was demonstrated across regional white matter bundles, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, in COPD patients, and it was related to cognitive function.

THE ROLE OF MODERN SHISHI IDEALS IN SYMPATHETIC JAPANESE APPRAISALS OF AN CHUNGGN,2017,"['An Chunggŭn', 'shishi', 'bushidō', 'anti-imperialism', 'socialism', 'Christianity']",,"After It Hirobumis assassination by An Chunggn, Japanese media tended to urge the Japanese government to adopt coercive policies toward Korea, under which Japan suppressed Korean riots and finally annexed Korea. However, there were also some Japanese intellectuals who viewed Ans action sympathetically. They shared the Confucian ideal of shishi (gentleman activist), a universal ethico-political model in pre-modern East Asia. This article will attempt to analyze the logic of these Japanese who endeavored to understand Ans action from the vantage point of Koreas subalterns. An Chunggns self-legitimization of his act, based as well on pan-regional Confucian ethics, was appropriated by his Japanese sympathizers as a sort of shishi consciousness, sometimes undistinguishable from the bushid (Way of the warrior) spirit. The appropriations happened differently in diverse milieus, including socialist and Christian circles. Most of them limited themselves to sympathizing with Ans sacrifice for the sake of his countrys independence, without an attempt to criticize imperialist discourses. Although remaining a tiny minority, Baba Koch (a progressive author and translator, 18691940), Ktoku Shsui (a socialist activist, 18711911) and Kashiwagi Gien (a Christian activist, 18601938) criticized Japans imperialist turn and its violations of Koreas sovereignty which eventually precipitated the assassination attempts against Japanese officials. Ktoku even went further offering a revolutionary strategy of anarchist communism and anti-imperialism aimed at building class solidarity between Asian peoples. While Kashiwagi did not renounce nationalism per se, he was in a position to relativize it based on the universal truth of Christianity. This article aims at grasping the meanings and historical significance of the expressions of sympathetic understanding towards Ans act in Japan.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Coumarin Variation in Iranian Biennial Melilotus Genetic Resources and its Relationship with Agro-morphophenological Traits,2017,"['iversity', 'forage yield', 'gene bank', 'multivariate methods', 'sweet clover']",,"Most of Melilotus Miller species, a forage legume, contain coumarin, an unfavorable component in their shoot. There is no information concerning coumarin on Iranian Melilotus germplasms. It is crucial for plant breeders to know the concentration of this component in the breeding materials, its relationship with other traits and with genotype geographic origin. In a two-year field study a total of 196 accessions of biennial Melilotus were planted in two replications in March 2014. Thirty-nine agro-morphobiochemical traits were recorded according to standard descriptors. Fluorescencemetery assay was applied to detect free, conjugated, and total coumarin concentrations in plant leaves. The data were subjected to correlation, path, regression, factor, and cluster analyses. Total coumarin concentration varied from 0.09 to 5.27 of leaf dry weight (LDW) with a mean of 1.63  0.08 of LDW among accessions. In M. officinalis, correlation analysis showed no significant correlation between coumarin concentration and cotyledon, hypocotyl, and stem colors. Therefore, no early predicting trait was determined to estimate coumarin concentration in the early growth phases of the germplasms. A positive linear relationship between leaf area and total coumarin concentration was observed by path and regression analyses. Based on factor analysis and extracted bi-plot, the scatter of accessions with low coumarin and high forage yield was determined. Materials were divided into three groups by k-means cluster analysis. There was no clear pattern between coumarin concentration and genotype geographic origin.

KV presents 10 rules related to tense in a chapter called khyta-kappa and MV does 6 rules in a chapter called chaho kao. As a result of the comparative analysis of those rules, the following points are observed Firstly, with regard to the arrangement of the related rules, KV deals with the tense suffix separately from the definition of tense in different rules, while MV deals with the tense suffix together with the definition of tense in one rule. Despite the different arrangement of the rules, both KV and MV classify Pli tense into five kinds, viz., three past tenses, one present tense, and one future tense.Secondly, in respect of the technical term for a tense, both KV and MV use significant word conveying the meaning of a particular tense. The terms that those grammars use are as follows. For the general terms of past tense, KV and MV use atta and bhta, respectively. For the terms of three types of past tense, ajjapabhuti atta(past tense beginning with today) in KV corresponds to bhta(general past tense) in MV hiyyoppabhuti atta(past tense before yesterday) in KV corresponds to anajjatana bhta(past tense except today) in MV and apaccakkha atta(past tense beyond speakers perception) in KV corresponds to parokkha bhtnajjatana(past tense beyond speakers perception except today) in MV. KV and MV use the term paccuppanna and vattamna to denote the present tense, respectively. And KV and MV use the term angata and bhavissati to denote the future tense, respectively.Thirdly, both KV and MV use the technical term of the tense suffix for the sake of concise and efficient expression. The terms that those two grammars use are as follows. KV provides the terms ajjatan, hiyyattan, parokkh, vattamn, and bhavissant for the group of tense suffixes, implying the meaning of each tense. Unlike KV, MV provides the terms -dayo, -dayo, a-dayo, tydayo, ssatydayo for the group of tense suffixes, by joining the initial suffix of the particular suffix group to the functional word di(beginning with, and so forth). Fourthly, with respect to sphere of application for the tense suffix, KV presents the application of those, limiting the related tense only, while MV presents wider application of those such as the contrariety or change of time(klabyattayo) and the use in a sentence that is irrelevant to tense.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

This trend is affected by the growing interest in Taiwan after the release of some modern Taiwanese films in Korea, positive attitude based on the popularity of K-Pop and Korean popular culture, and a little bit cheap price of goods and foods in Taiwan.Most of Korean tourists in Taiwan get information about their trips mainly through the Internet. The fact that travelers depend on very similar information via the Internet makes them traveling on a routinized schedule and consuming similar products. Although travelers are aware of this situation, it is believed that it creates the experiential value of the tourist site.Korean tourists think Taiwan is clean and the Taiwanese are friendly compared to mainland China, but they have a strong resistance to the scent of Taiwan, which is unfamiliar to Koreans. This leads to an attitude that the local traditional culture is difficult to accept easily. Moreover, many Korean travelers do not have much interest in the past situation and the history of places where they visit. This is the cultural attitude to Taiwan which Korean tourists have.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Also, the results reveal that firms classify interest and dividend received as investing activities and interest paid as financing activities when investing cash flows under K-GAAP are lower than the industry mean and when there exist analysts forecasting operating cash flows of the firm.

Wu, however, also had links to Cantonese sailors and anti- Qing secret societies. When the Small Swords Society took Shanghai in 1853, he found himself entangled in conflicting responsibilities and networks. Foreign traders and Chinese officials regarded Wu, like other middlemen on the Chinese coast, with a mixture of respect and distrust.Wus situation, however, was not unique to the mid-nineteenth century. This article compares Wu to other intermediaries who played similar roles in the sixteenth and late nineteenth centuries, in order to show the ways in which Wu, his predecessors, and those who followed in his footsteps connected China to the wider world by navigating the treacherous waters of diplomacy, war, and commerce.

Therefore, when senior citizens are emerging as a new bluesumer, it is very crucial to identify the needs, interests, and wants of the elderly. In South Korea, for instance, senior citizens are considered to be over 55 years old. Because the population is not growing, senior citizens health and quality of life are very important in different sectors since different age groups have different preferences. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of senior citizens on the tourism industry. We begin by segmenting the senior tourist market in South Korea by sought benefit using a mixture model to solve the problems identified by previous studies that used K-means clustering analysis. Statistical analysis was also done. As a result, a total of four segmentations were characterized by the four clusters derived by the BIC value. Clusters were labeled appreciate nature-seeking type, break-seeking type, various benefits-seeking type, and experience-seeking type.

Methods  A combined treatment of auditory training and sensory integration therapy was implemented to 3 children aged 4 to 7 and diagnosed with developmental delay during 9 weeks period from December 2016 to January 2017. ABA design which is one of single subject research designs was used in this study. Baseline A had 4 sessions, intervention B had 15 sessions, and baseline A had 4 sessions, so 23 sessions were applied in total. During the baseline A and A periods, visual perception ability was measured by K-DTVP-2 (Korea Developmental Test Visual Perception-2) and sensory processing ability was evaluated by sensory profile. The maintenance time of attention was measured with the absence of intervention for the baseline period, and for the intervention period, it was measured at 10 minutes break time which was provided after the intervention. The childrens attention time during a fine motor task provided were measured using video recorder with the interval recording method, and the interval for the evaluation was 30 seconds. Results  No statistically significant difference were found in the visual perception function and sensory processing scores before and after treatment. Attention of participant A enhanced significantly while that of participant B and C did not improve significantly. Conclusion  It is hard to conclude that sensory integration therapy combined with auditory perception training has positive effects on visual perception function and attention of children with developmental delays. However, there were significant increase in attention and improvements in behavior related to sensory processing for some cases in this study. In further study, longer intervention periods and valid measurement need to be applied in order to get better results. And it is proposed that more studies need to be done to enhance evidence of auditory perception training as a mean to facilitate attention and to prepare learning.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The proposed method, based on a statistical analysis, reduces loss of embedding capacity due to inequable use of candidate blocks. It works in such a way that computes the variance of each candidate block, preserves candidate blocks with high frequency components while reducing candidate blocks with low frequency components by compressing them exploiting the k-means clustering algorithm.

Recently, as several minimally invasive spinal surgeries have developed, a need of artificial bone substitutes such as demineralized bone matrix (DBM), has arisen. We investigated the in vivo bone growth rate of DBM as a bone void filler compared to a local autologous bone grafts. Methods  From April 2014 to August 2015, 20 patients with a one or two-level spinal stenosis were included. A posterior lumbar interbody fusion using two cages and pedicle screw fixation was performed for every patient, and each cage was packed with autologous local bone and DBM. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of leg pain and back pain and the Korean Oswestry Disability Index (K-ODI). Clinical outcome parameters and range of motion (ROM) of the operated level were collected preoperatively and at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Computed tomography was performed 1 year after fusion surgery and bone growth of the autologous bone grafts and DBM were analyzed by ImageJ software. Results  Eighteen patients completed 1 year of follow-up, including 10 men and 8 women, and the mean age was 56.4 (32-71). The operated level ranged from L34 to L5S1. Eleven patients had single level and 7 patients had two-level repairs. The mean back pain NRS improved from 4.61 to 2.78 (p0.003) and the leg pain NRS improved from 6.89 to 2.39 (p0.001). The mean K-ODI score also improved from 27.33 to 13.83 (p0.001). The ROM decreased below 2.0 degrees at the 3-month assessment, and remained less than 2 degrees through the 1 year postoperative assessment. Every local autologous bone graft and DBM packed cage showed bone bridge formation. On the quantitative analysis of bone growth, the autologous bone grafts showed significantly higher bone growth compared to DBM on both coronal and sagittal images (p0.001 and p0.028, respectively). Osteoporotic patients showed less bone growth on sagittal images. Conclusion  Though DBM alone can induce favorable bone bridging in lumbar interbody fusion, it is still inferior to autologous bone grafts. Therefore, DBM is recommended as a bone graft extender rather than bone void filler, particularly in patients with osteoporosis.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Choi In-ho published The City of Someone Else Familiar about forty years after the publication of Others room. These two novels are closely interrelated and need to be studied as one piece of problematic work describing the theme of problem consciousness that penetrates both novels. Both novels deal with events that became unfamiliar after their place suddenly lost their meaning. To reveal the issue of problem consciousness of these two novels is to find the direct and implied meaning connoted by the loss of the place character surrounding a character. Others room and The City of Someone Else Familiar are novel series that showcase the process of finding a lost self in material society through the process of transformation into the divine space. The City of Someone Else Familiar deals with the process of self-discovery more closely by expanding the spatial background that is confined to the private space to the public space.

분할 정복법을 이용한 Haskell GC 조정 시간 개선,2017,['GC'],,"The performance improvement of a single core processor has reached its limit since the circuit density cannot be increased any longer due to overheating. Therefore, the multicore and manycore architectures have emerged as viable approaches and parallel programming becomes more important. Haskell, a purely functional language, is getting popular in this situation since it naturally supports parallel programming owing to its beneficial features including the implicit parallelism in evaluating expressions and the monadic tools supporting parallel constructs. However, the performance of Haskell parallel programs is strongly influenced by the performance of the run-time system including the garbage collector. Though a memory profiling tool namely GC-tune has been suggested, we need a more systematic way to use this tool. Since GC-tune finds the optimal memory size by executing the target program with all the different possible GC options, the GC-tuning time takes too long. This paper suggests a basic divide-and-conquer method to reduce the number of GC-tune executions by reducing the search area by one-quarter for every searching step. Applying this method to two parallel programs, a maximally independent set and a K-means programs, the memory tuning time is reduced by 7.78 times with accuracy 98 on average.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
MudGet Reproduction of the desired lighting environment using a smart-LED,2017,['Smart LEDs Lighting environment design Color extraction'],,"With the emergence of smart LEDs, lighting based interior design is becoming popular. However, most of the smart LED-based lighting systems rely on expert-human intervention to create a desired atmosphere.For convenience, commercial lighting systems offer a number of options but their usability is fairly restricted. Therefore, an intuitive interface is required for novice users to generate the desired lighting environment. In this paper, we have developed a software, named MudGet, which automatically extracts the light mood from a digital image and controls the LED lamps to reproduce a desired lighting effect according to the extracted light mood. In our method, the light mood is regarded as a set of the representative colors of the digital image. The representative colors are extracted by utilizing K-means clustering algorithm. The dimming parameters are set for which each of the LED lamps create the lighting environment with the mood extracted by the software. To evaluate the feasibility of mood reproduction qualitatively, the degree of similarity between the light mood in the digital image and the reproduced result using LEDs is evaluated by a user study under a miniaturized experimental set.

Japanese academia refers to these screens as folding screens presented to the Joseon court as a gift () or zch bybu () for short. The Joseon court received 20 pairs of folding screens upon each mission from the fourth through the eleventh, eventually totaling more than 200 works. However, only three works in the National Palace Museum of Korea have been identified as this particular type of folding screena pair of Folding Screen with Image of Wild Geese and Lotus () and one Folding Screen of with Image of Peonies (). This paper determines that the Japanese folding screens in the National Museum of Korea collection Tadanobu () and Warriormonks at Yoshino () and Kasuga Festival () (Duk 2152), and Chinzei Hachir () (Duk 2119)are in fact among those presented to Joseon court by the Tokugawa shogunate.Tadanobu and Warriormonks at Yoshino and Kasuga Festival folding screens and the Chinzei Hachir folding screen became part of the National Museum of Korea collection early on in 1909 through the means of transfer and acquisition, respectively. Tadanobu and Kasuga were transferred from the Supplies Department (), which was an organ likely affiliated with the Imperial Museum of the Korean Empire, the first modern museum in Korea.Tadanobu and Warriormonks at Yoshino and Kasuga Festival folding screens were gifted to Gapsin sahaeng, meaning the eleventh diplomatic mission dispatched in 1764. Tadanobu and Warriormonks at Yoshino folding screen painted by Kan Tanrin (, 17321777) depicts an episode from the life of the loyal subject Sat Tadanobu () as he risked his life to save his lord, Minamoto no Yoshitsune (, 11591189), from a group of monk-soldiers at Yoshino (). As emphasized in this screen, the theme of loyalty corresponded to a remark made by Arai Hakuseki (, 16571725) to the eighth diplomatic mission in 1711 painting is the sole means to disprove that Japanese merely pursue a policy of militarism. In other words, the Tokugawa shogunate sought to convey particular intentions to Joseon by carefully choosing the motifs of the folding screens.Painted by Kan Dju (, ?1777), the Kasuga Festival folding screen portrays a parade (, owatari shiki) during the festival of the Kasuga miya and Wakamiya Shrine (, Kasuga miya Wakamiya gosairei) held at Kasuga Shrine and Kfukuji (), a historic temple in Nara (). During the owatari shiki parade, the arts of dengaku (, ritual music and dancing performance) and isaseuma (, pulling a horse offered by feudal noble family), both of which are dedicated to gods, are performed. Moreover, keiba (, horse racing) and nodachi (, carrying a large sword) events intended to show off the bravery of warriors were included in the parade. Although the Joseon populace did not know about such traditional Japanese arts, the Tokugawa shogunate seems to have been attempting to boast of their deep-rooted ritual traditions and advanced level of culture through the Kasuga Festival folding screen.Tadanobu and Warriormonks at Yoshino and Kasuga Festival folding screens presented to the eleventh diplomatic mission in 1764 and the Folding Screen of with Image of Peonies owned by the National Palace Museum of Korea all bear a signature mark that contains the Chinese character  (drawing) and the pen name of the artist, as well as the artists name seal. Such features only appear in the folding screens given to the eleventh diplomatic mission in 1764, and these three screens carry signatures written in this manner reserved for the Tokugawa shogunate. Thus, it can be observed that the Tokugawa shogunate meticulously oversaw how to write the artists signature, how to place the backing paper, and even how to mount these paintings.Kan Rysetsu (, 16471712) painted the Chinzei Hachir folding screen that the Tokugawa shogunate gifted to the Joseon court during Sinmyo gihaeng, the eighth diplomatic mission in 1711. This screen portrays an old fable in which Minamoto no Tametomo (, 11391170?), an uncle of Kamakura shogunate founder Minamoto no Yoritomo (, 11471199), subjugated the Kyushu area to which he had been exiled and earned the nickname Chinzei Hachir (, The Firstborn of the God of War in Kyushu). The Chinzei Hachir screen includes an explanatory note recounting the theme of the painting. Arai Hakuseki ordered the addition of this note in order to allow Joseon people to understand the story. Such an addition was made exclusively in the case of the eighth mission in 1711. The original explanatory note for the Chinzei Hachir screen is now lost, and only a slight vestige of the note remains. Nonetheless, the Chinzei Hachir screen is significant as the sole extant example demonstrating an attempt by the Tokugawa shogunate to assist Joseon viewers in understanding its motif.Japanese folding screens presented to the Joseon court provided a medium for transmitting the cultural and political policies of the Tokugawa shogunate to Joseon. By carefully choosing the motifs for the screens, the Tokugawa shogunate intended to demonstrate that, like Joseon, Japan could fully appreciate Confucian values and enjoyed a long history and sophisticated indigenous culture. The rediscovery of Tadanobu and Warriormonks at Yoshino, Kasuga Festival, and Chinzei Hachir folding screens as gifts to the Joseon court will provide a new perspective for the study of the Joseon Tongsinsa, which has previously been focused on its political and social aspects.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Methods Our study adapted the stimulation-facilitation model and technology applications as the aphasia intervention model, and adapted the auditory word recognition training and naming as intervention for each language form. Training words were chosen from a list of words in basic and intermediate level of Korean, proposed by the National Institute of Korean Language. Speech recognition function was implemented by using Googles web speech API in order to compose appropriate contents for the participant. The research design was a multiple baseline design across settings. A 76-year-old woman with chronic Wernickes aphasia participated in this study for six days a week for four weeks, with each session lasting more the one hour. Results The results of the usability test showed that the WSRITP was convenient and easy enough for Wernickes aphasic patients to use. Significant improvement had been achieved in the section of naming and that of answering questions which was not referred to in training, which was viewed as results between a pre-test and a post-test. In a post-experiment test of picture-explanation, the participant not only produced all of the words that she had been trained to, but she also produced sentences that were never mentioned before in the training program. In the K-WAB, her ability in the tests of naming objects, auditory word recognition, sequential commands, and yesno questions was greatly improved. Conclusions It is certain that the WSRITP is an effective means to help patients with Wernicke aphasia improve their ability of auditory comprehension.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

This paper aims to illumine the lived experience of the new through methods of hermeneutics in Goettingen school, and for this it intends to analyse the concept of phenomenological-hermeneutic description. First, this paper analyses Georg Misch concept of evoking speech. Evoking speech reveals the transcendent world by means of awakening the being beyond the world. It unveils religious experience, e.i. the inestimable significance of life. Misch intends to extend traditional logic to hermeneutic logic, and as a result of that he can conceptualize the infinite. Second, this paper analyses Josef Knigs concept of aesthetic effect, that connects human with artwork and reveals this as a fact. The predicate of aesthetic effect is not the determined predicate, but the modifying. It occurs a significance of being in inwardness with the help of the modifying predicate. The aesthetic effect is similar with religious experience in regard that it makes the new in inwardness. The origin of new significance is the effect that makes human as a new being.

As in other countries, forests, green areas, agricultural lands are rapidly changing into residential or industrial areas in South Korea. Monitoring such rapid changes in land use requires rapid data acquisition, and satellite imagery can be an effective method to this demand. In general, SAR(Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellites acquire images with an active system, so the brightness of the image is determined by the surface roughness. Therefore, the water areas appears dark due to low reflection intensity, In the residential area where the artificial structures are distributed, the brightness value is higher than other areas due to the strong reflection intensity. If we use these characteristics of SAR images, settlement areas can be extracted efficiently. In this study, extraction of settlement areas was performed using TerraSAR-X of German high-resolution X-band SAR satellite and KOMPSAT-5 of South Korea, and object-oriented image classification method using the image segmentation technique is applied for extraction. In addition, to improve the accuracy of image segmentation, the speckle divergence was first calculated to adjust the reflection intensity of settlement areas. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the two satellite images, settlement areas are classified by applying a pixel-based K-means image classification method. As a result, in the case of TerraSAR-X, the accuracy of the object-oriented image classification technique was 88.5, that of the pixel-based image classification was 75.9, and that of KOMPSAT-5 was 87.3 and 74.4, respectively.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

In time series analysis monthly ESP dam inflow prediction values were nearly similar for every years, particularly less accurate in wet and dry years. The proposed BAYES-ESP improved the performance of ESP, especially in wet year. The SS was used for quantitative analysis of monthly mean of observed dam inflows, predicted values from ESP and BAYES-ESP. The results indicated that the SS values of ESP were relatively high in January, February and March but negative values in the other months. It also showed that the BAYES-ESP improved ESP when the values from ESP and observation have a relatively apparent linear relationship. We concluded that the existing ESP method has a limitation to predict dam inflow in Korea due to the seasonality of precipitation pattern and the proposed BAYES-ESP is meaningful for improving dam inflow prediction accuracy of ESP.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

After the relocation of the capital to Heian, following the order of the honke leader to publish Shinsen shjiroku, a descendant of Kichita no muraji Jishu, Kichita no muraji Suemoto, who worked in the Saky, led other officers to submit the Shinsen shjiroku, which was then proofread at the publishing office in order to be published in Shinsen shjiroku of the Saky kobetsu. This meant that the shutsuji of the Kichita no muraji descent group, who were officials of overseas origin, was changed to the kobetsu descent group, who were of the Wani descent group origin. The change of the shutsuji was done in such a way that the Kichita no muraji descent group joined the Wani descent group, who were in a consanguineous family relationship as sworn brothers using the fact that they were in a close relationship both in residence and in the workplace. In addition, this change was made through the so-called genealogy incorporation of the progenitor, by adding Hikokunibuku no mikoto, the fourth-generation grandson of Amaterasu Hikokuniosihito no mikoto, to Shiotaritsu, who was the original progenitor of the descent group of Kichita no muraji.  And there is no claim that they are of the kobetsu descent group of the Wani descent group in Shoku Nihon kki, but the progenitor of Fuminushi, who belonged to Uky, is described only as a Japanese Shiotaritsu. However, since the honke of the Kichita no muraji descent group was certified as a kobetsu descent group with the publication of Sakyo kobetsu in Shinsen shjiroku, the records afterward followed suit that Shiotaritsu, the grandson of Hikokunibuku no mikoto, was Japanese and the migration to Japan of his eighth-generation grandson, Kichidaijo, was described as him returning to Japan due to homesickness. However, it is written in Fuminushi sotsuden, in Nihon Montoku Tenn jitsuroku, that the ancestors of Fuminushi, who had the honke of Kichita no muraji, were from Baekje. This means that even though they were described as kobetsu in Shinsen shjiroku, which is a genealogy record, or as having a Japanese progenitor in Shoku Nihon kki, the compilers of Nihon Montoku Tenn jitsuroku in the late ninth century, during the Heian Period, stated that it was reasonable to judge that the descendants of the Kichita no muraji descent group were of overseas origin from Baekje.   In addition, a comparison between the case where the shisei title written in the extant Shinsen shjiroku and in Itsubun is consistent with the given kabane from the Knin period, and the case where the shisei title described in the extant Shinsen shjiroku is inconsistent with the given kabane, verified that the discordance of the shisei title and the given kabane recorded in the extant Shinsen shjiroku was created when the record of the given sukune in the second year of Knins rule, which discussed the name change for clans, in other words for the people who belonged to Ukyo, was copied as it was during the making of a draft of Shinsen shjiroku.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

However, rather than one voice, overlapping and unidentifiable voices are heard from the records of the life of the expelled(Giorgio Agamben). This brings up more complex questions in addition to the question, Can the Subaltern Speak?(Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak) Whose voice is it? Where is the voice positioned? To whom is the voice spoken? Where will they go?  Our task is to read between the lines of these vague voices by reading various types of texts together. Contrasting images such as lightdarkness and wanderingparadise appear repeatedly in the autobiographical narratives of hansens disease patients, and their meanings are multi-layed. Bright light and New light simultaneously represent a wandering life and the paradise of the future(Soon Sim, Ha-Woon Han), while the pink spots on the bodies of Hansens disease patients symbolize the stigmas of despair and curse(Ji-Young Yoon).  Furthermore, the paths of wandering and migration that appear in the testimonies and real life stories of Hansens disease patients will be comprehended within historical and cultural contexts(Jeon-Hwang Sim, Baek Kim). The Hybridity(Homi K. Bhabha) of narratives with unclear boundaries between fact and fiction and between history and culture can be interpreted not only as a sign of the tragic life and history of Hansens disease patients, but also as a resisting strategy against the discriminatory view of society.  In contrast, in the novel Your Paradise by Yi Cheong-jun, which accepts and transforms various motifs in an autobiographical narratives of Hansens disease patients, the pink land Sorokdo is a place where the possibility of paradise and community is asked for again. In particular, the impulse of Mimesis(Walter Benjamin) exhibited by the characters in the island in this novel is read as a practical action that differently speaks and writes the memories of stigma.  To understand the reality of Hansens disease patients, we must listen to words at a place where various breaths and voices are crossed. I hope that the memories and traces of stigmas that have not been recorded in official history and have not been extinguished yet will be revealed.

The study had following findings.First, loving-kindness meditation emphasized mett-bhvan (cultivation of loving-kindness) in an effort to give happiness to people, whereas compassion meditation emphasized karu-bhvan (cultivation of compassion) from the more positive context of rescuing people by rooting out their sufferings, which marked a big difference between these two.Second, this karu-bhvan is a rare discipline method in the early Buddhism or in Asias southern schools, and such positive interpretation of rooting out sufferings and disasters derived from Abhidharmajnaprasthna- stra() and later established itself as the core ideas of Yogcrabhmistra and Mahayana Buddhism after going through the great compassion ideology of Abhidharmamahvibhs- stra().Third, while loving-kindness meditation in Asias southern schools belonged to the third line of form (Rpaloka, ) in terms of discipline, compassion meditation was described to include not only form, also desire (Kmaloka, ) and formless (Arpaloka, ) realm, belonging to VipassanaFourth, according to Yogcrabhmi-stra, how to define and clarify compassion meditation as Vipassana observing six different objects of meaning, thing, symptom (lakaa), dignity (paksa), time and reason, is the unique nature of compassion meditation as shown only at Yogcrabhmi-stra - not to be seen in other literatures.Lastly, Fifth, when comparing ideology shown in the Samdhinirmocana-sutra and Yogcrabhmi stra based on the subject of loving-kindness and compassion meditation as a matter of time of establishment, Samdhinirmocana-sutra was established first, and Yogcrabhmi-stra was added afterward.

Recently while the public philosophy is being actively discussed, the discussion is expanding to the research of public concern. The research of publicness is an intellectual to urge transformation of consciousness about the solution to the whole global issues as well as Korean society activity from the perspectives covering religion, state, enterprise, and academies. Especially in East Asia Korea and Japan is leading a research among solidarity of these researches. The Korean religions which had tried to overcome sufferings from imperialism are appropriate aspects for the research of public concern from these points.  To do it, first, I tried to set a categories of publicness research into modern Korean religions. The activity scope of modern Korean religions covers variety of scopes such as politics, economy, culture, art, and civil movement, and it took as core tasks nationalism, anticapitalism, enlightenment movement, community, coexistence of ideology, civil awareness for freedom, social engagement, and harmony of social diversity. From these perspectives, I examined the possibility of publicness research through four aspects such as response to the capitalism, public movement of civil awareness, independence struggle and recovery of the national sovereignty, and new culture movement.  Continuously, I studied how Won-Buddhism realized the history of public concern during its first century. Comprehensively, I arranged the ideological aspect of reformed Buddhism in which it define itself concretely as a public religion, and arranged its history of delivering people from the aspect of practice. I arranged the formers meaning and value through the dharma authentication of the seal of blood from bare fingers, Park Jung-bins compilation of The Reformation Theory of Buddhism in Joseon Dynasty (Chosn pulgyo hyksin non) and The Principal Book of Buddhism (Pulgyo chngjn), and arranged the latters through movement of the savings union, levee project at Yeongsan, anti-Japan movement, Song Gyus declaration of On Founding a State (Knguk non).  Based on the history, I treated the public characteristics of Won-Buddhism as a religion from the aspects of inheritance of Mahayana spirit and the spirit of engaged Buddhism. I saw the former as the theory of delivering sentient beings and curing the world, and the thought of communicative interfusion, and examined they are connected with the thought of Great Opening and universal ethics respectively. Won-Buddhism shares the context with modern reformed Buddhism in Asia, and it succeeded to the bodhisattvas spirit in Mahayana Buddhism. And it also accepted the thought of the Great Opening which was a spiritual axis in modern Korean religions. Won-Buddhism, as an engaged Buddhism, established as its doctrine the universal values that modern society requires through the realization of communicative interfusion thought.  Lastly, after liberation from Japan, I added a solidarity movement of religions as one aspect of realizing the public concern by Won-Buddhism. After all, I saw Won-Buddhism can secure objectivity as a public religion by reflecting how it could realize in daily life the religious spirit through the world peace movement, establishment of equal order, practice of globalized spiritual movement and global organization of the United Religions that it declared itself.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The mean score of each object on both monitors was independently analyzed, using t-test and interobserver reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of SPSS.Results The overall mean scores of fiber, group of specks, and mass in 5M were 4.25, 3.92, and 3.28 respectively, and scores obtained in 4K monitor were 3.81, 3.58, and 3.14, respectively. No statistical difference was seen in scores of fiber and mass between the two monitors at all exposure conditions, but the score of group of specks in 4K was statistically lower in the overall (p  0.0492) and in underexposure conditions (p  0.012). The ICC for interobserver reliability was excellent (0.874).Conclusion Our study suggests that since the mammographic phantom images are appropriate with no significant difference in image quality observed between the two monitors, the 4K monitor could be used for clinical studies. Since this is a small preliminary study using phantom images, the result may differ in actual mammographic images, and subsequent investigation with clinical mammographic images is required.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Walp. were evaluated in a multi-environment trial for phenotypic stability of grain yield, maturity and grain size. There was highly significant genotype x environment interaction for all traits. Simple correlation coefficient was computed to ascertain the level of relationship between stability parameters and agronomic traits. Line IT93K-452-1 was identified as most stable genotype and can be grown all over the Nigerian cowpea belt. The line IT90K-503-1 was the most unstable genotype in terms of grain yield and was also nonresponsive to the environment. However, it is environment specific. IT93K-452-1 has relatively stable maturity across environments. The result suggests that IT93K-452-1 will mature around the average of 65 days irrespective of the location in Nigeria. Lines IT95K-1455 and IT90K-503-1, whose stability parameter values were high, means that in respect of maturity, they are photo-thermo sensitive. They can mature early or delayed depending on the photo-thermal environment. However, lines such as IT93K-273-2-1, IT93K-129-4, IT93K-452-1 and IT86D-719 are photo-thermo insensitive. Line IT93K-1543 was identified as the most desirable genotype in terms of grain size. This is followed by IT93K-452-1. The line IT90K-503-1 had small but unstable seed size. This work identified IT93K-452-1 and IT93K-273-2-1 as the most stable genotypes for yield and maturity. Grain yield was highly positively correlated with bi and Rsup2sup but was negatively correlated with Sdsup2supsubisub. Maturity was negatively highly correlated with bsubisub, Wsubisub, and CVsubisub. Grain size on the other hand is not correlated with any of the parameters.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

다수의 영상간 효율적인 스티칭을 위한 카메라 센서 정보 기반 영상 그룹핑 기술,2017,"['Panorama', 'Stitching', 'K-mean clustering', 'GPS', 'Azimuth', 'FOV', 'SURF']",,"Since the panoramic image can overcome the limitation of the viewing angle of the camera and have a wide field of view, it has been studied effectively in the fields of computer vision and stereo camera. In order to generate a panoramic image, stitching images taken by a plurality of general cameras instead of using a wide-angle camera, which is distorted, is widely used because it can reduce image distortion. The image stitching technique creates descriptors of feature points extracted from multiple images, compares the similarities of feature points, and links them together into one image. Each feature point has several hundreds of dimensions of information, and data processing time increases as more images are stitched. In particular, when a panorama is generated on the basis of an image photographed by a plurality of unspecified cameras with respect to an object, the extraction processing time of the overlapping feature points for similar images becomes longer. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing process to efficiently process stitching based on an image obtained from a number of unspecified cameras for one object or environment. In this way, the data processing time can be reduced by pre-grouping images based on camera sensor information and reducing the number of images to be stitched at one time. Later, stitching is done hierarchically to create one large panorama. Through the grouping preprocessing proposed in this paper, we confirmed that the stitching time for a large number of images is greatly reduced by experimental results.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Burnett v.Chetwood(1720) 판결과 Gyles v. Wilcox(1740) 판결은 노동을 중시하여, 각각 번역본과 축약본을 새로운 작품으로 볼 수 있다고 판시하였다. 이로써천재의 독창성, 특허법상의 신규성이 아니라, 베끼지 않음을 의미하는 독창성 개념이 싹트게 된다. 또한 Tonson v. Collins(1760) 등의 판례를 거치면서 표현의 독창성이라는 개념이 형성된다. 이같이 18세기 영국 사법부는베끼지 않은, 표현에 존재하는이라는 독창성 개념을 만들었고, 이는 지금까지 이어져 오고 있다. 한편, 18세기 문학계에서의 독창적 천재 논의와 18 세기 후반 낭만주의 시대 도입에 따른 미적 독창성 개념은 영국 법조계에거의 영향을 주지 못했다. 이는 근대적 저작권법의 입법이 늦은 유럽대륙(프랑스, 독일)과 다른 점이다.","Under the U.K. Copyright Act, the origin of the originality concept dates back to the Ann Act(1710). The Act grants rights to authors and others without mentioning originality. The concept of originality developed in the process of interpretation of the concept of author in the court until the copyright law explicitly required originality in 1911.Burnett v Chetwood (1720) and Gyles v Wilcox (1740) ruled that labor was important, and that translations and abbreviations could be viewed as new works, respectively. In this way, the concept of originality, which means not copied, is born, different from the creativity of genius or novelty in patent law. In addition, through the judgments of the late 18th century, the notion of originality of expression is formed. Thus, in the 18th century, the British judiciary created the concept of originality, which is not copied and original in expression. The concept of creative genius in literature in the 18th century and the concept of aesthetic originality in the late 18th century romanticism had little impact on the British legal system.

This proposal is based upon an actual experimentation with drama productions at Asia United Theological University (a.k.a. ACTS). Since 2014, ACTS has hosted a series of theo-drama stage productions (chiefly, movement art-oriented) - which were choreographed and directed by this author - as listed belowImago (2014) biblical overview of salvation history from Genesis to RevelationProphetica (2015) preaching drama portraying the biblical prophetic type lineageCommunio (2016) theological meaning of communion based on John Calvins viewResurrectio (2017) essence of the crossresurrection as depicted by the body of ChristHere, the term theo-drama, short for theological drama, refers to a way of expression on stage through diverse artistic means, such as dance, mime, acting, design, and media, among others, to depict the biblical theological concepts in a more visual and experiential way. Thus, theo-drama may be understood as a sort of theologizing on stage, or simply theology on stage.Although the term, theo-drama, is used by some theologians (Hans Urs von Balthasar and Kevin J. Vanhoozer, among others) as a way of interpreting the Scripture in terms of dramatic or theatrical paradigm, I am using the term primarily as a practical way of depicting the biblical theological themes and their significances on stage. In other words, while based on these biblical-theological interpretations of theo-drama, I extend the implications to the actual productions and performances of such interpretations through creative theatrical means on stage.In this thesis, the concept of theo-drama is essentially scripted and analyzed through the lens of one particular case study of theatrical production called Resurrectio. The thesis will be in two parts. First, the theo-drama Resurrectio is explained in detail from various aspects of its planning, choreography, production, and performance. Second, the implications in terms of means and principles are drawn from this and other experiences of theo-drama productions, as follows (1) creative staging (2) movement art (3) theological drama (4) theological education and (5) cross-cultural mission.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

In the habitat types cluster analysis, non-hierarchical cluster analysis (kmeans cluster analysis), hierarchical cluster analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling method were applied to 14 habitat types recorded more than 30 times. A total of 7 Orders, 16 Families, and 39 Species of mammals were identified in the 3rd National Ecosystem Survey collected nationwide. When 11 clusters were classified by habitat types, the simple structure index was the highest (ssi  0.07). As a result of the similarities and hierarchies between habitat types suggested by the hierarchical clustering analysis, the residential areas were the most different habitat types for mammals the next following type was a cluster together with rivers and coasts. The results of the non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis demonstrated that both Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus restrictively appeared in a residential area, which is the most discriminating habitat type. Lutra lutra restrictively appeared in coastal and river areas. In summary, according to our results, the mammalian habitat can be divided into the following four types (1) the forest type (using forest as the main habitat and migration route) (2) the river type (using water as the main habitat) (3) the residence habitat (living near residential area) and (4) the lowland type (consuming grain or seeds as the main feeding resource).",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

It targeted students majoring in Speech-Language Pathology in three-year colleges and four-year universities in Daegu, Busan, Gwangju, and Gyeonggi-do. 106 three-year course students and 75 four-year course students participated. The questionnaires were composed of five questions of daily courses by BEPSI-K, 32 questions of clinical practice stress, and 10 questions of coping of clinical practice stress. Results The study found that the stress encountered by students majoring in Speech-Language Pathology is below average. Of the factors, practice role is highest, followed by, in order, clinical practice, valueideal, and human relationship. Also, the study revealed that students majoring in Speech-Language Pathology used aggressive coping more often than passive coping to cope with clinical practice stress. Social support is used the highest in aggressive coping. Avoidance coping is used the highest in the passive coping section. Conclusions According to the study, the higher the stress between practice instructers and peers, the lower degree of social support coping. The higher the stress on human relationships, the higher the degree of emotional coping and hopeful coping. This means that the systematic improvements to the improving and controlling ability of human relationships is needed institutionally.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate ventilation rate in pig house by using the thermal distribution data rather than tracer gas. Especially, LMA (Local Mean Age), which is an index based on the age of air theory, was used to evaluate the ventilation rate in pig house. Firstly, the field experiment was conducted to measure micro-climate inside pig house, such as the air temperature, CO2 concentration and wind velocity. And then, LMA was calculated based on the decay of CO2 concentration and air temperature, respectively. This study compared between LMA determined by CO2 concentration and air temperature the average error and root mean square error were 3.76 s and 5.34 s. From these results, it was determined that thermal distribution data could be used for estimation of LMA. Finally, CFD (Computational fluid dynamic) model was validated using LMA and wind velocity. The mesh size was designed to be 0.1 m based on the grid independence test, and the Standard k-omega model was eventually chosen as the proper turbulence model.

Overall, the RFs and mean temperature changes of CO2 at Yeon-dong during most years (except for 2014) were estimated to be higher than those at Gosan. This might be possibly because of its higher concentrations at Yeon-dong due to relatively large energy consumption and small photosynthesis and also the difference in radiation flux due to the different input condition (e.g., local time and geographic coordinates of solar zenith angle) in the model. The annual mean RFs and temperature changes of CO2 were highest in 2015 (2.41W m 2 and 1.76 K) at Yeon-dong and in 2013 (2.22W m 2 and 1.62 K) at Gosan (except for 2010 and 2011). The maximum monthlyseasonal mean RFs and temperature changes of CO2 occurred in spring (Mar. andor Apr.) or winter (Jan. andor Feb.) at the two sites during the study period, whereas the minimum RFs and temperature changes in summer (Jun.-Aug.). In the case of CH4 and N2O, their impacts on the RF and mean temperature changes were very small (an order of magnitude lower) compared to CO2. The spatio-temporal differences in these RF values of GHGs might primarily depend on the atmospheric profile (e.g., ozone profile), surface albedo, local time (or solar zenith angle), as well as their mass concentrations.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

We use the widely-accepted methodology W-NOMINATE, supplemented with a cluster analysis to further overcome the limits of survey, linear, or interfacial analyses that appear in the related studies.The result indicate that the 19th parliamentary political cleavages were at least five dimensional, and confirm a clear-cut cleavage between the progressives and conservatives. The area between the two parties is composed of minority parties, established in the 19th and 20th Congress, where they form a hierarchical structure within the political sector of the major parties. Meanwhile, the ruling conservative party showed a high level of political intensity with an unique cluster, but most of all progressive parties included more than two distinct clusters of political disposition. Thus, the study found that the political cleavages were one of the major factors impeding the party politics by incentivizing party-to-party political transactions rather than responses to civil society in policy.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

This particular poetic work was created when the author was appointed as the magistrate of the district of Mokchn, relatively a marginal position in the country, and the poems became an important source to understand the authors consciousness and emotional experience reflected in the lyrics.  Hwang Yunsk employed the extended form of sijo, called ynsijo, which enabled him to convey the details of his feelings. However, he detach himself from the convention of ordinary sijo and created a unique form and the content, in which he deals with his loyal attitude toward the ruler on the one hand and expresses his affection for his family on the other. His poems also illuminate his selfhood in reality. In general, Hwangs poems are characterized by two major subjects the embodiment of the Confucian ideology and the authors own individual aspect of life. In other words, Hwangs poems can be divided between the autobiographic writing and the expression of the Confucian ideology. Particularly, he portrayed the reality of his life as a local official in the autobiographic writing, which captures his private feelings and the condition of life. On the other hand, the poems show that the internalization of the Confucian norms and ideology propelled him to focus on study and self-cultivation.  In this context, Mokchu chapka has interwoven various elements of Hwangs consciousness of reality and his feelings. In conclusion, Mokchu chapka reflects the literatis consciousness of an elite man in the local area during the 18th Century and also shows the interiority of the poet. While he served as the magistrate of Mokchn, he struggled to overcome his frustration with the reality and his poemwriting likewise provided him with a way to overcome his frustration through the realization of the NeoConfucian ideology in the literary world.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Demographic data were collected, and clinical symptoms, cognitive function, and social function were evaluated to verify SCoRS-Ks reliability and validity. Clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia Scale. Cognitive function was evaluated using a short form of the Korean Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Social function was evaluated using the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale, and the Social Functioning Scale.Results Data analysis demonstrated SCoRS-Ks statistically significant reliability and validity. SCoRS-K has high internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha patient 0.941, informant 0.905, interviewer 0.964) test-retest reliability patient 0.428 (p0.003), informant 0.502 (p0.001), interviewer 0.602 (p0.001) and global rating 0.642 (p0.001). The mean scores of subjects were significantly higher than those of the controls (p0.001), demonstrating SCoRS-Ks discriminant validity. Significant correlations between the total scores and global rating score of SCoRS-K and those of the scales and tests listed above (except WCST) support SCoRS-Ks concurrent validity.Conclusion SCoRS-K is a useful instrument for evaluating the degree of cognitive dysfunction in Korean schizophrenia patients.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

By taking advantage of a path-dependent maximum range (PDMR) cycle definition (Dong et al., 2010 Wei and Dong, 2010), the two parameters are formulated by introducing a moment of load path (MLP) based equivalent stress intensity factor range (   SUB  K   NP  SUB  ) and a maximum effective stress intensity parameter   SUB  K   Max  SUB   incorporating an interaction term   SUB  K   I  SUB  SUB  K   III  SUB  .

The North announced a new policy to rebuild and reestablish propaganda systems focusing on propaganda offices as top priority.  There are some important differences. When it came to operational structure, North Korea introduced paid-propaganda officers and sent them to the rural areas, which meant that North Korea consolidated and centrally managed all propaganda officers. When it came to working system, party memberships were required to become any member of propaganda offices. In addition to that, each provincial party committee and peoples committee were forced to be responsible to educate and select directors of propaganda offices.  Through these efforts, North Korea enabled local citizens to support the Kim Il-sung regime and to unite and fight for North Korea and Kim Il-sung.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
SPACE TELESCOPE AND OPTICAL REVERBERATION MAPPING PROJECT.VI. REVERBERATING DISK MODELS FOR NGC 5548,2017,,,"PWe conduct a multiwavelength continuum variability study of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 to investigate the temperature structure of its accretion disk. The 19 overlapping continuum light curves (1158 angstrom to 9157 angstrom) combine simultaneous Hubble Space Telescope, Swift, and ground-based observations over a 180 day period from 2014 January to July. Light-curve variability is interpreted as the reverberation response of the accretion disk to irradiation by a central time-varying point source. Our model yields the disk inclination i  36 degrees - 10 degrees, temperature T-1 (44 - 6) x 10(3) K at 1 light day from the black hole, and a temperature-radius slope (T proportional to r(-alpha)) of alpha  0.99 - 0.03. We also infer the driving light curve and find that it correlates poorly with both the hard and soft X-ray light curves, suggesting that the X-rays alone may not drive the ultraviolet and optical variability over the observing period. We also decompose the light curves into bright, faint, and mean accretion-disk spectra. These spectra lie below that expected for a standard blackbody accretion disk accreting at LL-Edd  0.1.P",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
The Effects of Altered Membrane Cholesterol Levels on Sodium Pump Activity in Subclinical Hypothyroidism,2017,"['Hypothyroidism', 'Sodium-potassium-exchanging ATPase', 'Membrane lipids']",,"Background Metabolic dysfunctions characteristic of overt hypothyroidism (OH) start at the early stage of subclinical hypothyroidism(SCH). NaK-ATPase (the sodium pump) is a transmembrane enzyme that plays a vital role in cellular activities in combinationwith membrane lipids. We evaluated the effects of early changes in thyroid hormone and membrane cholesterol on sodiumpump activity in SCH and OH patients.Methods In 32 SCH patients, 35 OH patients, and 34 euthyroid patients, sodium pump activity and cholesterol levels in red bloodcell membranes were measured. Serum thyroxine (T4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were measured using enzymelinkedimmunosorbent assays. Differences in their mean values were analysed using post hoc analysis of variance. We assessed thedependence of the sodium pump on other metabolites by multiple regression analysis.Results Sodium pump activity and membrane cholesterol were lower in both hypothyroid groups than in control group, OH groupexhibiting lower values than SCH group. In SCH group, sodium pump activity showed a significant direct dependence on membranecholesterol with an inverse relationship with serum TSH levels. In OH group, sodium pump activity depended directly on membranecholesterol and serum T4 levels. No dependence on serum cholesterol was observed in either case.Conclusion Despite the presence of elevated serum cholesterol in hypothyroidism, membrane cholesterol contributed significantlyto maintain sodium pump activity in the cells. A critical reduction in membrane cholesterol levels heralds compromised enzyme activity,even in the early stage of hypothyroidism, and this can be predicted by elevated TSH levels alone, without any evident clinicalmanifestations.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Inorganic nitrogen dynamics of throughfall following fertilization in a red pine stand,2017,"['Fertilization', 'nutrient', 'nutrient cycle', 'nitrogen ﬂux', 'nutrient concentration', 'rainfall']",,"Inorganic nitrogen uxes caused by rainfall and throughfall following fertilizer applications were measured in a red pine stand located in the Wola National Experimental Forest in Jinju, Korea. Fertilizer (N3P4K1  11315037 kg ha1 yr1) was applied for 2 years, and inorganic nitrogen uxes were monitored from April 2011 to March 2013. Monthly variations in inorganic nitrogen concentrations were generally higher in the throughfall than in the rainfall, whereas monthly variations in concentrations were similar between the fertilized and control treatments. The mean NH4 and NO3 concentrations during the study period were 0.39 and 0.21 mg L1 for the rainfall, 1.06 and 1.06 mg L1 for the control, and 1.01 and 0.89 mg L1 for the fertilizer treatments, respectively. Inorganic nitrogen uxes were generally higher during the growing season (May October) than during the dormant season (NovemberApril). Inorganic nitrogen uxes were higher in the throughfall (17.03 kg ha1 yr1 in the control treatments and 14.93 kg ha1 yr1 in the fertilizer treatments) than in the rainfall (10.66 kg ha1 yr1).

Monte Carlo Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis with Continuous-Energy Covariance Data,2017,,,"PThe continuous-energy Monte Carlo (MC) sensitivity and uncertainty (SU) analysis conducted using the multigroup covariance matrices has a theoretical pitfall in that it is inconsistent with the principle of continuous-energy MC neutronics calculations because the use of the multigroup covariance matrices means treating covariance data as multigroup variables rather than continuous-energy variables. As a way to get around this deficiency and perform the MC SU analysis on the theoretically consistent principle, this paper presents a new continuous-energy MC SU formulation which directly utilizes the continuous-energy covariance data in the evaluated nuclear data libraries instead of the multigroup covariance matrices produced by nuclear data processing codes. The validity of the new MC SU formulation is examined in terms of the input-nuclear-data-induced k uncertainty of the Godiva critical assembly and the TMI-1 pin cell problem by inputting the continuous-energy covariance data of nuclides involved directly into the continuous-energy MC transport calculations by a Seoul National University MC code, McCARD.P",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

"Velocity Fluctuations Driven by the Damped, Aperiodic Mode in the Intergalactic Medium",2017,,,"POn account of its finite temperature, the unmagnetized intergalactic medium (IGM) is subject to thermal fluctuations. Due to the fundamental coupling between particles and fields in a plasma, the field fluctuations generate current densities by means of the Lorentz force and thereby affect both the density and the velocity fluctuations of the particles. Recently, a new damped, aperiodic mode was discovered that dominates field fluctuations in the IGM. Apart from its impact on the transport properties of the IGM that determine the propagation of cosmic rays, previous research has shown that this mode provides turbulent magnetic seed fields of 6 x 10(-18)G that are an essential ingredient in the generation of cosmic magnetic fields. The current investigation addresses the influence of the mode on the particle motion. In order to describe the corresponding state of the turbulence, both the spectrum and the integrated total value of the mode-driven proton velocity fluctuations are computed. It is found that the latter amounts to 1.16 x 10(8)T(4)(72)n(-7-)(12)cm s(-1) assuming a temperature of T-e  T-p  10(4) T4K and a density of n(e)  n(p)  10(-7)cm(-3). This value is two orders of magnitude larger than the thermal velocity. If the IGM neutrals adopt the same velocities as the protons by mutual charge exchange and elastic collisions (ambipolar diffusion), atomic lines propagating through the IGM are expected to display spectral broadening, enhanced by a factor of 90 beyond the thermal level in the case of hydrogen. This opens the window to a first direct observation of the damped aperiodic mode.

The elements are determined based on the case of a gear tooth flank, with various friction coefficients on the free surface and friction in the crack being taken into account. The results show that friction on the free surface and, consequently, tangential forces have an impact on whether the crack will propagate along the free surface or into the depth.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Heat transfer experiments were conducted using infra-red thermography for materials of three thermal conductivities stainless steel (IkI 13.4WmK), Corian (IkI 1WmK), and polycarbonate (IkI 0.2WmK). Conjugated heat transfer was analyzed with the combined effects of conduction through the test plates and convective heat transfer due to the arrayed jet impingement. The inclination angle of the film cooling holes was 35 and that of the jet impingement holes was 90. The film and jet impingement holes on each plate were arranged in staggered patterns, and the film cooling holes and jet impingement holes were also positioned in a staggered pattern. The jet Reynolds number, based on hole diameter, was 3000 and the equivalent blowing ratio was 0.3. The diameter of the film cooling holes and the jet impingement holes was 5mm. The distance between jet and film hole plates was varied in the range 1 IHIIdI 5. Total cooling effectiveness was measured with and without jet impingement. When jet impingement was added to the internal cooling, the averaged total cooling effectiveness was enhanced about 8.4. At low Biot numbers, meaning that cooling performance dominated over the conduction effect, the temperature distribution became more uniform due to higher conductive heat transfer. The total cooling effectiveness was strongly related to the Biot number of the plate, and the correlation between total cooling effectiveness at various Biot numbers was determined to predict the total cooling effectiveness in an actual gas turbine engine.

If evoked potential to electrical stimulus is recorded in primary visual (V1) cortex, it means that the stimulus effectively evokes visual perception. Therefore, in this study, we established VEP recording system on V1 cortex using BioPAC modules as the judging tool. And the measuring system was evaluated by recording VEP of mice. After anesthesia, normal mice (C57BL6J strain n  6) were secured to stereotaxic apparatus (Harvard Apparatus, USA). For the recording of VEP, the stainless steel needle electrode (impedance 2-5kOmega) was positioned on the surface of the cortex through the burr hole at 2.5 mm lateral and 4.6 mm caudal to bregma. DA 100C and EEG 100C BioPAC modules were used for the trigger signal and VEP recording, respectively.

These are made from the time of King Chinhng to the time of Queen Sndk. Moreover, these treasures came to occupy the status of treasures that protect the nation, as the mere existence of the treasures was able to persuade the king of Kory to abandon his plan to attach Silla. As a result, the treasures were made by the kings of the sacred bone snggol with the Buddhist background, and again, the treasures added to power and authority to the sacred bone snggol family, so the treasure Sambo became a symbol of the nation.The stories that demonstrate the miraculous powers of the three national treasures of Silla appear in the legends of the nine-tiered pagoda of Hwangnyong Temple and of the jade belt. And it is correct to understand that the king of Kory mentioned in these stories is a king of Kogury rather than Wang Kn, the founder of the Kory dynasty. Above all, it is important to take into consideration the fact that the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms was compiled in the Kory dynasty. Therefore in the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms, Kory is consistently referred to as this dynasty and Wang Kn as Taejo. Such circumstances eliminate the possibility that Taejo would have been referred to as simply the king of Kory. Taejo Wang Kn, who was aware of the need for and had the will to unify the then-divided three kingdoms, or Samhan, showed interest in the three treasures of Silla. Then in 935 and 937, the three treasures were handed over to Wang Kn after Sillas surrender and through Kim Pus presentation of the jade belt to Taejo.

Effect of phosphorus deficiency on erythrocytic morphology and function in cows,2017,"['cow', 'erythrocyte', 'function', 'morphology', 'phosphorus deficiency']",,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of phosphorus (P) deficiency on the morphological and functional characteristics of erythrocytes in cows. Forty Holstein-Friesian dairy cows in mid-lactation were randomly divided into two groups of 20 each and were fed either a low-P diet (0.03 Pkg dry matter DM) or a control diet (0.36 Pkg DM). Red blood cell (RBC) indices results showed RBC and mean corpuscular hemoglobin decreased while mean corpuscular volume increased significantly (p  0.05) in P-deficient cows. Erythrocyte morphology showed erythrocyte destruction in P-deficient cows. Erythrocytes functional characteristics results showed total bilirubin and indirect bilirubin concentrations and aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase activity levels in the serum of P-deficient cows were significantly higher than those in control diet-fed cows. Activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in erythrocytes were lower, while the malondialdehyde content was greater, in P-deficient cows than in control diet-fed cows. NaK-ATPase and Mg2-ATPase activities were lower in P-deficient cows than in control diet-fed cows however, Ca2-ATPase activity was not significantly different. The phospholipid composition of the erythrocyte membrane changed and membrane fluidity rigidified in P-deficient cows.

Similarly, fronting eliminates the resultative reading from the lo-phrase constructions. This paper examines various types of fragmentation and right dislocation (RD), focusing on whether they behave like fronting or not, i.e., whether they remove the figurative meaning andor the resultative reading from the relevant constructions. The data indicate that no movement is involved in deriving fragments and gapless RD constructions, while gapped RD constructions are derived from movement. Given this in-situ hypothesis, the island-sensitivity of contrastive fragments and specificational gapless RD constructions can be captured by revising Abes (2016) deletion rule, reflecting the idea of contrastivity and pied-piping of Griffiths  Liptk (2014) along the line of Krifka (2006) Delete up to Focus and pied piped Contrastive Focus.

Response to the Editor,2017,,,"Thank you for your letter to our publication in Osteoporosis and Sarcopenia entitled on Recent nutritional trend of calcium and vitamin D in East Asia. Although the increase in calcium nutrition from food in postmenopausal women is urgent issue, Dr Yoo Kyoung Park pointed out that our claim is still premature to apply to whole population. As Dr Y-K Park pointed out that the KNHANES study had been limited the age ( 50 years of age) of the participants and the findings about calcium insufficiency should not be expanded into entire population 1.On the other hand, the National Nutrition Survey in Japan 2 was subjected community dwelling household (n  3507) including the people aged over 1 year. Therefore, the participants of this research consisted of entire generation of Japan.The report of the National Nutritional Survey in Japan indicated that the calcium intake in younger generation (420e454 mg day for age 20e40 years old) was less than postmenopausal women (568e546 mgday for sixties and seventies). In addition, total caloric intake of younger generation (1706 and 1652 kcalday for twenties and forties, respectively) and the postmenopausal women (1766 and 1639 kcalday for sixties and seventies, respectively) were almost same level suggesting that the calcium density in foods (Calcium in mgdayCaloric intake in k Cal) was around 30 less in the younger generation (0.25e0.27 mgkcal) than those in the older generation (0.32e0.33 mgkcal). As it was written in our article, the calcium intake in older generation was still far less from the calcium requirement (788 mgday for old women or 0.48 mgkcal) 3. Therefore, the postmenopausal women, who had relatively high calcium intake, took calcium around 70 of requirement.Although there was no available data regarding the effect of calcium intake on the development of peak bone mass in a prospective study design in Asian population, the low calcium intake seen in a younger generation in Japan strongly suggested that the development of proper peak bone mass may not be achieved by the recent young generation in Japan. Bone health has been reported to improve in Vietnamese postmenopausal women, who were received nutritional education 4. Therefore, re-education regarding calcium intake will be required for the younger population. On the other hand, since the older generation in Japan had been adapted to the traditional dietary custom, it may be difficult to increase in calcium intake from the foods, further. Thus, we propose to take calcium supplement for the older generation.Since bone mineralization abnormalities in VDR knock out mice was recovered by increasing calcium and phosphate intakes 5, intestinal calcium absorption is an essential factor to promote bone calcification rather than vitamin D. Thus, the insufficient intake of calcium seen in recent Japan may be critical in not only postmenopausal women but also in the younger generation, and that is why we emphasized our concern for all Japanese generation.The intestinal calcium absorption is higher in the people with habitually low calcium intake through active transport system by calcitriol especially in younger generation 6. On the other hand, the intestinal adaptation for low calcium intake may not properly active in elderly people because of low production of 1,25(OH)2D in kidney 7. Therefore, passive transport of calcium, which is facilitated by high calcium intake, may have a meaningful role on the bone metabolism in the older people. In addition to high calcium intake, vitamin D nutrition also plays an important role on bone health. As Dr.Yoo Kyoung Park pointed out properly, we could not present vitamin D nutritional status in our National Nutritional survey, because the research did not measure serum level of 25(OH)D in the participants. However, the survey was reported the vitamin D intake from food in the participants. The mean intake of vitamin D in the female participants age...",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

MethodsA stratified random cluster sample of 625 community-dwelling old people living alone in Daegu completed a questionnaire through face-to-face interview. Quality of life was evaluated using the World Health Organization quality of life-brief(WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. Depression was measured using the geriatric depression scale short form-Korea(GDSSF-K). The other data including sociodemographic characteristics, emotional and economical support, perceived health status and activity of daily living were collected. The data were analyzed using independent t-test, ANOVA, multiple regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between quality of life and other variables.  ResultsSubjects were composed of 107 male(17.1) and 518 female(82.9) and their mean age was 75.5 (SD 5.8). Multiple regression analysis showed that quality of life was significantly associated with depression, psychiatric illness, educational level, income level, presence of caregiver, and whether living alone was a voluntary decision. Depression was the most influential factor affecting quality of life. Participants suffering more severe depression had lower quality of life.  ConclusionPresent study suggested that the quality of life in the elderly living alone should be recognized in a multiple perspective ways considering psychosocial approach as well as clinical symptoms. We also would like to emphasize the comprehensive multidisciplinary team approach for improvement of the quality of life in elderly people who live alone.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The participant was a middle-aged female patient who had been suffering from schizophrenia and held in a closed ward for more than 3 years. In total, 80 sessions of art therapy were carried out. The change in quality of life was monitored through records of art therapy procedures, observation of behavior by hospital staffs, the HTP test, and the Korean version of 4th revision of Schizophrenia Quality of Life (SQLS-R4K). The results showed the following. First, the participant experienced decreased anxiety, helplessness, and atrophy, and increased emotional stability through the emotional nurturing experiences from art therapy, enabling her to lead a normal life in the hospital and eventually upgrading her quality of life. Second, according to the HTP test, the participant showed less anxiety, helplessness, and atrophy, and the changed attitude allowed the participant to have a positive relationship with others. Third, according to SQLS-R4K, the drop in the result from 57.57 to 25.75 means the participants quality of life increased in the psychosocial feelings domain, cognition domain, and vitality domain. Therefore, art therapy could help positively influence a chronic schizophrenic patients quality of life and lead her to have a normal life thanks to the emotional nurturing experiences.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Design of hydro electromagnetic and piezoelectric energy harvesters for a smart water meter system,2017,"['Non-contact energy harvester', 'Impedance matching', 'Electromagnetic energy harvester', 'Piezoelectric energy harvester', 'Smart water meter system', 'Water leakage warning system']",,"PIn this paper, a turn-buclde type stainless steel waterwheel with a diameter of 90 mm and two pole magnets was proposed, as turn-buckle type waterwheels do not require any hole in the pipe unlike other self-powered water meters that use DC motor-based energy generation. In addition, by designing non-contact energy harvesters using magnets, the proposed energy harvesters are semi-permanent. The performance of the manufactured energy harvesters was analyzed under experimental conditions in a flowing water setup composed of a PVC pipe and a water pump. The electrical output power of the energy harvesters was measured under various load resistance conditions. The maximum root mean square (RMS) output power of the electromagnetic and the piezoelectric energy harvesters were 648 mW at 200 Omega and 0.196 mW at 10 k Omega, respectively. The generated electrical energy works differently. The energy harvested by the electromagnetic energy harvester is used to be a power source for the smart water meter system while the energy harvested by the piezoelectric energy harvester is used to be a water leakage detector for the water leakage warning system.

Highly ordered copper oxide (Cu2O) nanopillar arrays using template assisted electrodeposition technique and their temperature dependent electrical characteristics,2017,"['Copper oxide', 'Nanopillars', 'Electrodeposition', 'Electron transport', 'Metal-semiconductor contacts']",,"Highly ordered Copper Oxide (Cu2O) nanopillars were successfully grown inside the porous anodized alumina (AAO) template by electrodeposition technique. To liberate the AAO template to get the free standing nanopillars, several etching trials were conducted using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution of varying concentration (ranging from 1 M to 5 M) and reaction time (8e60 min). On investigating the etched samples using scanning electron microscope, it was found that the sample treated with 1 M NaOH for 60 min yielded AAO template free standing vertically aligned nanopillars. Resistances of these nanopillars were found to be three orders of magnitude greater than the thin film which was used as a control sample. The temperature dependent (180e300 K) current-voltage (I-V) measurement on nanopillars showed non-linear characteristics which was analyzed using back to back schottky diode model and thermionic field emission (TFE) theory. Our calculations revealed that the carrier transport is diffusive (mean free path  8.9 nm   length of nanopillars  4 mm) in nature and the existence of defect sites with activation energies of 0.3 and 0.6 eV which acts as hole traps. This present work demonstrates a reliable technique for realizing vertically aligned Cu2O nanopillars which could find application in solar cell, gas sensors, Li ion batteries, and memory devices.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Instead of simply gathering survey results or expert opinions to research the preference for a recently launched product, enterprises need a way to collect and analyze various types of online data and then accurately figure out customer preferences.  In the main concept of existing data-based survey methods, the sentiment lexicon for a particular domain is first constructed by domain experts who usually judge the positive, neutral, or negative meanings of the frequently used words from the collected text documents. In order to research the preference for a particular product, the existing approach collects (1) review posts, which are related to the product, from several product review web sites (2) extracts sentences (or phrases) in the collection after the pre-processing step such as stemming and removal of stop words is performed (3) classifies the polarity (either positive or negative sense) of each sentence (or phrase) based on the sentiment lexicon and (4) estimates the positive and negative ratios of the product by dividing the total numbers of the positive and negative sentences (or phrases) by the total number of the sentences (or phrases) in the collection. Furthermore, the existing approach automatically finds important sentences (or phrases) including the positive and negative meaning toagainst the product. As a motivated example, given a product like Sonata made by Hyundai Motors, customers often want to see the summary note including what positive points are in the car design aspect as well as what negative points are in thesame aspect. They also want to gain more useful information regarding other aspects such as car quality, car performance, and car service. Such an information will enable customers to make good choice when they attempt to purchase brand-new vehicles. In addition, automobile makers will be able to figure out the preference and positivenegative points for new models on market. In the near future, the weak points of the models will be improved by the sentiment analysis. For this, the existing approach computes the sentiment score of each sentence (or phrase) and then selects top-k sentences (or phrases) with the highest positive and negative scores.  However, the existing approach has several shortcomings and is limited to apply to real applications. The main disadvantages of the existing approach is as follows  (1) The main aspects (e.g., car design, quality, performance, and service) to a product (e.g., Hyundai Sonata) are not considered. Through the sentiment analysis without considering aspects, as a result, the summary note including the positive and negative ratios of the product and top-k sentences (or phrases) with the highest sentiment scores in the entire corpus is just reported to customers and car makers. This approach is not enough and main aspects of the target product need to be considered in the sentiment analysis.  (2) In general, since the same word has different meanings across different domains, the sentiment lexicon which is proper to each domain needs to be constructed. The efficient way to construct the sentiment lexicon per domain is required because the sentiment lexicon construction is labor intensive and time consuming.  To address the above problems, in this article, we propose a novel product reputation mining algorithm that (1) extracts topics hidden in review documents written by customers (2) mines main aspects based on the extracted topics (3) measures the positive and negative ratios of the product using the aspects and (4) presents the digest in which a few important sentences with the positive and negative meanings are listed in each aspect. Unlike the existing approach, using hidden topics makes experts construct the sentimental lexicon easily and quickly. Furthermore, reinforcing topic semantics, we can improve the accuracy of the product reputati",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

(1) 선언문에서 단어tathgatagarbha는, 소유복합어로서 tathgatadhtugarbha가 stpa를 수식(즉, 여래의유물을가진stpa) 하는 다른 대승 경전에서 증명되듯이, tathgatadhtugarbhn stpn, dhtugarbhe caitye (유물을 가진 caitya (sadhtuke caitye)라는표현으로 바꿔 말할 수도 있다.) 등과 같은 표현을전제할 것이다. (2) 이 선언문에서 불교 비문()의 dhtudhk 나 dhtudhara와 같은(둘 다stpa를 생략) 표현에서 발견되는 동일한 생략, 곧 명사 stpa의 생략을 반영할 수 있을 것이다. (3) 열반경의 선언문은 자연스럽게 (법신(dharmakya)과 여래장(tathgatagarbha)의 관점으로부터 열반경에서 재해석되는) 여래의 열반(tathgatas nirva)과 탑에 있는 그의 유물을 다루는 열반경의 주요 주제와 연결되어야 한다. (4) 열반경은 모든 존재들은 실제 stpacaitya라고 정확히 선언하고, 이 선언은 모든 존재들은 tathgatagarbha(즉, stpa)를 가진다(tathgatagarbha sarvasattvn)는 구와 맥락상 일치한다. (5) 열반경의 산스크리트 구절에서 우리 위에 tathgatagarbha가 있다(asmkam upari tathgatagarbho sti)에는 또 다른 해석이 있을수있다. 이 표현에서 단어tathgatagarbha는 위에 언급된 해석 과 위배되지 않고, 오히려 이 것은 법화경(Saddharmapuarka)의 유명한 장면을 상기시킨다. 즉, 청중들 위 하늘로 올라오는 stpa다(saptaratnamaya stpo bhyudgata ... paranmaalasyopari vaihyasa tihet). 따라서, 나는 이 선언문 속에서 단어tathgatagarbha를 잠정적으로stpa 를 수식하는 소유복합어로 해석할 것을 제안한다. 그러나, 나는 단어의 부차적인 의미로 tathgatagarbha를 격한정복합어로 해설하는 것이 가능하다고 생각한다. 왜냐하면 시모다 마사히로나 미하일 라디치가 이미 지적하였듯이 garbha라는 단어의 의미가 풍부하기 때문에, 두세 가지의 의미로 단어를 사용할 수도 있기 때문이다.","In this paper, I shall propose a hypothetical interpretation of the phrase tathgatagarbha sarvasattvn, which is a declarative formula of the Mahparinirvamahstra (abbr. MPMS) and is preserved as original Sanskrit. This phrase confirms that the word tathgatagarbhaif this is a bahuvrhi compoundcannot grammatically go with the word sattvn unlike the case of the Tathgatagarbhastra, in which tathgatagarbha, being a bahuvrhi, qualifies the noun sattva (sarvasattvs tathgatagarbh). Previous studies have mostly interpreted tathgatagarbha of the MPMS, as a tatpurua, whereas I shall keep this as a bahuvrhi and take it to be an adjective which qualifies some undescribed nounthat is, stpa, omitted in the phrase, based on the following reasons (1) The word tathgatagarbha in the formula is probably premising such expressions like tathgatadhtugarbhn stpn, dhtugarbhe caitye (which is paraphrased by the expression sadhtuke caitye a caitya that contains relics), etc., as found in other Mahyna scriptures, where tathgatadhtugarbha, as a bahuvrhi, qualifies the noun stpa a stpa that contains tathgatas relics (2) the omission of the noun stpa in the formula might reflect the same omission found in expressions, such as dhtudhk or dhtudhara (both omitting stpa), as found in Buddhist inscriptions (3) The declarative formula of the MPMS should naturally be relevant to the main topic of the MPMS, which deals with tathgatas nirva and his relics that were found in stpas (which, in turn, are reinterpreted in the MPMS from the viewpoint of the dharmakya and tathgatagarbha) (4) The MPMS precisely declares that all beings are real stpacaitya, and this declaration fits well with the phrase tathgatagarbha sarvasattvn all beings have tathgatagarbha (i.e. stpa) (5) We find yet another expression (asmkam upari tathgatagarbho sti there is tathgatagarbha above us) in the Sanskrit fragment of the MPMS however, the word tathgatagarbha, in this expression, does not disturb the above- mentioned interpretation. Instead, this reminds us of the famous scene taught in the Saddharmapuarkathe stpa arising in the sky above the audience saptaratnamaya stpo bhyudgata ... paranmaalasyopari vaihyasa tihet. Accordingly, I shall tentatively propose to interpret the word tathgatagarbha in the formula as a bahuvrhi which qualifies the noun stpa. I think, however, it is possible to apprehend tathgatagarbha as a tatpurua, to be the secondary meaning of the word because the MPMS most probably utilizes the word with double or triple meaning in order to preserve the semantic richness of the word garbha, which has already been pointed out by Masahiro Shimoda and Michael Radich.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
(Patent Box Regime),2017,"['?利盒?制', '技???所得?惠?制', 'BEPS第五行???', '??法', 'Patent Box Regime', 'Tax Preferential Regime for IP income', 'BEPS Action Plan 5', 'Nexus Approach']",,"This paper focuses on the Chinese Patent Box Regime. The Patent Box Regime is the preferential tax scheme for royalties or capital gains from intellectual properties which RD performances make. In China, the government has made some legislative progress for supporting national corporations to do RD work sufficiently and effectively. The Chinese Patent Box Regime includes tax preferential content to apply the special rate for transferring their intellectual properties such as capital gain from the IPs. It means that the tax regime chooses a little different route than other countries which operate the Patent Box Regime to apply this scheme for royalties and capital gains from the IPs.  The Patent Box Regime brings about a side effect that people usually know, tax avoidance. According to this side effect, the global society comes out to take some action for abusing the Patent Box Regime. It shapes up as the primary part of BEPS Action 5. But it doesnt mean that the Patent Box Regime genuinely be made for tax avoidance. This paper makes a little solution to make up for weakness of the Patent Box Regime.  Chapter 2 explains the reason why the Patent Box Regime comes into the picture. In existing RD tax schemes, it focuses on RD costs and the front-end of RD process. First of all, companies make sufficient RDs for our society, but these companies lack RD money. However, the Patent Box Regime focuses on the diametrical position where it concentrates on the back-end of RD process. Following this manner, the Original Patent Box Regime could measure the social effect from the IPs. The Patent Box Regime designates commercial success of the IPs such as royalties or capital gains from the IPs as a proxy of the positive social effect. Chapter 2 also examines the calculation method for taxation technically, and considers legislative examples of other countries (including OECDG20 Actions) to choose and operate the Patent Box Regime U.K., the Netherlands, France, Ireland, and Belgium.  Chapter 3 is an overview of the Chinese RD tax system, including the Chinese Patent Box Regime. The Chinese government currently operates diverse tax preferential schemes for supporting RD deduction for RD costs, the tax credit system for RD, and the tax preferential scheme for innovative technology companies designated by the government. This paper explores these tax systems features briefly.  Chapter 4 suggests personal opinions to make up for supporting and operating the Chinese Patent Box Regime desirably. First of all, the Chinese system extends the scope of the qualified taxpayer to include PEs in China. The qualified income and asset of the Chinese Patent Box Regime could also be needed to support RD results and adjust practical problems. It would expand the qualified IPs to allow acquired IPs from the 3rd parties. In addition to expanding the qualified IPs, applying the Patent Box Regime to the following income could be needed to increase the social effect of this tax preferential regime short-term (under 5 years) licensing fee and embedded royalties, etc. Finally, the current Chinese Patent Box Regime needs consolidation work to compile the administrative regulation for the regime such as the U.K. example.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Based on previous reports that total lymphocyte count (TLC) and subpopulation lymphocyte counts (SLCs) are associated with nutritional status in patients with dialysis, we designed this study to examine the relationships of the TLC and SLCs with clinical outcome and nutritional status in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).Methods In this prospective, observational study, we enrolled 66 patients (50 HD patients and 16 PD patients) receiving stable maintenance dialysis. We evaluated the baseline parameters of height weight TLC SLCs expressing CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19 CBC iron profile (iron, TIBC, ferritin) BUN Cr Na K total CO2 Ca P iPTH protein albumin total cholesterol HDL LDL uric acid and CRP and calculated Onoderas prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) and the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) at baseline and three months. To analyze differences in the TLC and SLCs between the HD group and the PD group, we performed an independent samples t-test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict malnutrition in dialysis patients. In addition, to analyze changes in TLC, SLCs expressing each marker (CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19) and other nutritional markers, we performed general linear model (GLM)-repeated measures ANOVA.Results Mean age was 55.8  12.7 years in HD paitents and 49.8  14.5 years in PD patients. The duration of dialysis was 59.7  52.9 months in HD patients and 66.1  33.6 years in PD patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed that patients aged 60 years or older, women, and those whose CD19 SLCs were lower than 100 had a higher risk of developing malnutrition. In GLM-repeated measures ANOVA, CD19 SLCs were significantly higher in women and in patients with a shorter period of dialysis.Conclusions Our results indicate that GNRI, OPNI, TLC and SLCs (especially CD19 count) may be significant nutritional markers in HD and PD patients.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Optimization of low frequency sound absorption by cell size control and multiscale poroacoustics modeling,2017,"['Ultrasonication', 'Cell structure control', 'Acoustic damping', 'Poroacoustics modeling', 'Finite element analysis']",,"PSound absorption of a polyurethane (PU) foam was predicted for various geometries to fabricate the optimum microstructure of a sound absorbing foam. Multiscale numerical analysis for sound absorption was carried out by solving flow problems in representative unit cell (RUC) and the pressure acoustics equation using Johnson-Champoux-Allard (JCA) model. From the numerical analysis, theoretical optimum cell diameter for low frequency sound absorption was evaluated in the vicinity of 400 mu m under the condition of 2 cm 80 K (thickness of 2 cm and density of 80 kgm(3)) foam. An ultrasonic foaming method was employed to modulate microcellular structure of PU foam. Mechanical activation was only employed to manipulate the internal structure of PU foam without any other treatment. A mean cell diameter of PU foam was gradually decreased with increase in the amplitude of ultrasonic waves. It was empirically found that the reduction of mean cell diameter induced by the ultrasonic wave enhances acoustic damping efficiency in low frequency ranges. Moreover, further analyses were performed with several acoustic evaluation factors root mean square (RMS) values, noise reduction coefficients (NRC), and 13 octave band spectrograms.

First, Wolyeong Wetlands hold hydrological remnants such as paddy terraces, water reservoirs and irrigation ditches at least for 25 years. Second, organic matter and total nitrogen show high concentrations in water-logging areas, while available phosphates show opposite trends. Third, the concentration of exchangeable cations is CaMgKNa or CaMgNaK in order, and show different distribution patterns from wetland to wetland. The terrace structures help to have maintained flooding conditions after abandonment, contributing to the development of Wolyeong Wetlands. The soils in Wolyeong Wetlands show higher organic matter and Ca cation, but lower available phosphates in comparison to those of general paddy soils it seems to suggest the sequential changes after the stop of agricultural activities. Soils in Wolyeong Wetlands belong to the higher Ca concentration group. The fact that the general paddy soils can also be classified as the same category urges us to reconsider the meaning of the higher Ca concentration as a criterion for classifying mountainous wetlands.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

An increase in Ssubmixsub led to an increase in micro-hardness and a decrease in thermal conductivity () due to severe lattice distortion. Furthermore, NiCoFeCrMn high-entropy alloy (HEA) exhibited the highest sub1subsubesub ratio of 1.13, because with increasing Ssubmixsub the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity (sub1sub) was less than that of electron thermal conductivity (e). In particular, a crossover in the properties variation was noticeable at a specific Ssubmixsub of 8.30.3 JmolK, which means the properties of single phase FCC solid solutions can be optimized by modulating Ssubmixsub. The results can provide a guideline for manipulating the properties of single solid solutions using the HEA design concept, and help develop novel materials with optimal properties that are usable in extreme environments.

In addition, indoor air quality in the 46 daycare centers was measured over 37 days using a real-time monitor (AirGuard K).Results The daily means of CO 2 and PM in the 46 daycare centers were 1042.74  134.45 ppm and 67.60  18.25 gm 3 , respectively. Indoor air quality in the daycare centers showed significant temporal fluctuation. Measurements for single days were significantly different from the 37-day average exposure. Relative error of short term exposure decreased with an increase in the number of sampling days. The noncompliance rate for CO 2 using the official testing method was 2.17, and none exceeded the PM 10 standard of 100 gm 3 . With monitoring over 37 days, the daily noncompliance rate for CO2 was 50.4 and the daily noncompliance rate for PM was 13.8.Conclusions When the official test method evaluates the indoor air at daycare centers one day per year, the results may not represent actual indoor air quality over a longer period of time.

However, the measurement of liquid viscosity is not always easy when the materials have toxicity and instability. In this study, a modified scaled variable reduced coordinate (SVRC)-quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) model is suggested and analyzed in terms of its performance of prediction for liquid viscosity compared to the conventional SVRC-QSPR model and the other methods. The modification was conducted by changing the initial point from triple point to ambient temperature (293 K), and assuming that the liquid viscosity at critical temperature is 0 cP. The results reveal that the prediction performance of the modified SVRC-QSPR model is comparable to the other methods as showing 7.90 of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and 0.9838 of R2. In terms of both the number of components and the performance of prediction, the modified SVRC-QSPR model is superior to the conventional SVRC-QSPR model. Also, the applicability of the model is improved since the condition of the end points of the modified model is not so restrictive as the conventional SVRC-QSPR model.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Background The Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index was firstly developed for the assessment of hot outdoor conditions. It is a recognised index that is used world-wide. It may be useful over a range of outdoor conditions and not just for hot climates.  Method Four group experiments, involving people performing a light stepping activity, were conducted to determine human responses to outside conditions in the U.K. They were conducted in September 2007 (autumn), December 2007 (winter), March 2008 (spring) and June 2008 (summer). Environmental measurements included WBGT, air temperature, radiant temperature (including solar load), humidity and wind speed all measured at 1.2m above the ground, as well as weather data measured by a standard weather station at 3m to 4m above the ground. Participants physiological and subjective responses were measured. When the overall results of the four seasons are considered, WBGT provided a strong prediction of physiological responses as well as subjective responses if aural temperature, heart rate and sweat production were measured.  Results WBGT is appropriate to predict thermal strain on a large group of ordinary people in moderate conditions. Consideration should be given to include the WBGT index in warning systems for a wide range of weather conditions. However, the WBGT overestimated physiological responses of subjects. In addition, tenfold Borgs RPE was significantly different with heart rate measured for the four conditions except autumn (p 0.05). Physiological and subjective responses over 60 minutes consistently showed a similar tendency in the relationships with the WBGThead and WBGTabdomen.  Conclusion It was found that either WBGThead or WBGTabdomen could be measured if a measurement should be conducted at only one height. The relationship between the WBGT values and weather station data was also investigated. There was a significant relationship between WBGT values at the position of a person and weather station data. For UK daytime weather conditions ranging from an average air temperature of 6C to 21 with mean radiant temperatures of up to 57, the WBGT index could be used as a simple thermal index to indicate the effects of weather on people.  Application The result of evaluation of WBGT might help to develop the smart clothing for workers in industrial sites and improve the work environment in terms of considering workers wellness.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

(2) 이 선언문에서 불교 비문()의 dhtudhk 나 dhtudhara와 같은(둘 다stpa를 생략) 표현에서 발견되는 동일한 생략, 곧 명사 stpa의 생략을 반영할 수 있을 것이다. (3) 열반경의 선언문은 자연스럽게 (법신(dharmakya)과 여래장(tathgatagarbha)의 관점으로부터 열반경에서 재해석되는) 여래의 열반(tathgatas nirva)과 탑에 있는 그의 유물을 다루는 열반경의 주요 주제와 연결되어야 한다. (4) 열반경은 모든 존재들은 실제 stpacaitya라고 정확히 선언하고, 이 선언은 모든 존재들은 tathgatagarbha(즉, stpa)를 가진다(tathgatagarbha sarvasattvn)는 구와 맥락상 일치한다. (5) 열반경의 산스크리트 구절에서 우리 위에 tathgatagarbha가 있다(asmkam upari tathgatagarbho sti)에는 또 다른 해석이 있을수있다. 이 표현에서 단어tathgatagarbha는 위에 언급된 해석 과 위배되지 않고, 오히려 이 것은 법화경(Saddharmapuarka)의 유명한 장면을 상기시킨다. 즉, 청중들 위 하늘로 올라오는 stpa다(saptaratnamaya stpo bhyudgata ... paranmaalasyopari vaihyasa tihet).따라서, 나는 이 선언문 속에서 단어tathgatagarbha를 잠정적으로stpa 를 수식하는 소유복합어로 해석할 것을 제안한다. 그러나, 나는 단어의 부차적인 의미로 tathgatagarbha를 격한정복합어로 해설하는 것이 가능하다고 생각한다. 왜냐하면 시모다 마사히로나 미하일 라디치가 이미 지적하였듯이 garbha라는 단어의 의미가 풍부하기 때문에, 두세 가지의 의미로 단어를 사용할 수도 있기 때문이다.","In this paper, I shall propose a hypothetical interpretation of the phrase tathgatagarbha sarvasattvn, which is a declarative formula of the Mahparinirvamahstra (abbr. MPMS) and is preserved as original Sanskrit. This phrase confirms that the word tathgatagarbhaif this is a bahuvrhi compoundcannot grammatically go with the word sattvn unlike the case of the Tathgatagarbhastra, in which tathgatagarbha, being a bahuvrhi, qualifies the noun sattva (sarvasattvs tathgatagarbh). Previous studies have mostly interpreted tathgatagarbha of the MPMS, as a tatpurua, whereas I shall keep this as a bahuvrhi and take it to be an adjective which qualifies some undescribed nounthat is, stpa, omitted in the phrase, based on the following reasons (1) The word tathgatagarbha in the formula is probably premising such expressions like tathgatadhtugarbhn stpn, dhtugarbhe caitye (which is paraphrased by the expression sadhtuke caitye a caitya that contains relics), etc., as found in other Mahyna scriptures, where tathgatadhtugarbha, as a bahuvrhi, qualifies the noun stpa a stpa that contains tathgatas relics (2) the omission of the noun stpa in the formula might reflect the same omission found in expressions, such as dhtudhk or dhtudhara (both omitting stpa), as found in Buddhist inscriptions (3) The declarative formula of the MPMS should naturally be relevant to the main topic of the MPMS, which deals with tathgatas nirva and his relics that were found in stpas (which, in turn, are reinterpreted in the MPMS from the viewpoint of the dharmakya and tathgatagarbha) (4) The MPMS precisely declares that all beings are real stpacaitya, and this declaration fits well with the phrase tathgatagarbha sarvasattvn all beings have tathgatagarbha (i.e. stpa) (5) We find yet another expression (asmkam upari tathgatagarbho sti there is tathgatagarbha above us) in the Sanskrit fragment of the MPMS however, the word tathgatagarbha, in this expression, does not disturb the above- mentioned interpretation. Instead, this reminds us of the famous scene taught in the Saddharmapuarkathe stpa arising in the sky above the audience saptaratnamaya stpo bhyudgata ... paranmaalasyopari vaihyasa tihet. Accordingly, I shall tentatively propose to interpret the word tathgatagarbha in the formula as a bahuvrhi which qualifies the noun stpa. I think, however, it is possible to apprehend tathgatagarbha as a tatpurua, to be the secondary meaning of the word because the MPMS most probably utilizes the word with double or triple meaning in order to preserve the semantic richness of the word garbha, which has already been pointed out by Masahiro Shimoda and Michael Radich.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
Prevalence of Atrial Fibrillation in Korean Population,2017,"['Atrial Fibrillation', 'Epidemiology', 'Stroke', 'Oral Anticoagulation']",,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice and has been a major public health problem. The prevalence of AF globally has been reported to range from 0.4 to 2 in the adult population however, the prevalence widely varies depending on the study population. Although AF prevalence in Asian population is about 1 lower than that in European and North American population, the number of AF patients in Asia is rapidly increasing concomitant with the increased aging of the population. However, previous studies that reported AF epidemiology in the Korean population are limited. According to a recent report based on the national health claims database, prevalence of AF in 2015 was 0.7 in the entire Korean adult population and showed a continuous increase with population aging. Additionally, among patients with AF, mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was significantly increased and the number of high thromboembolic risk patients has increased over time. Although oral anticoagulation (OAC) prescription in AF patients increased from 35 to 51, especially after introduction of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants, a substantial proportion of Korean patients with AF still remain undertreated. In this review, we aimed to summarize temporal changes in the prevalence and incidence of AF and to evaluate the thromboembolic risk in patients with AF. In addition, we also discussed the utilization of OAC therapy in patients with AF in Korean population.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Above all asychronism of online communication supported by the technology has overcome the time and geological limitation, thus leads to the increase in the number of the disputes. However procedures such as litigations and ADR which need physical presence are deemed inappropriate to resolve the new types of disputes arising in the online context. Accordingly the role of online space and ODR have received attention as the alternative field to resolve and prevent the online disputes. Also the techincal feauture of ODR that ignores geologycal and phsical limitation has rendered it as a cheap and convinient means to resovle the offline disputes as well as the online disputes. In this regard it is argued that ODR can serve as a digital justice since it can substatially enhance the accessability to justice. In essence ODR can not only function as an optimal platform to resolve low-value-high-volume online disputes arising out of e-commerce, but also as the practical means to resolve disputes in countries in conflicts or in remote areas where parties can hardly have access to the dispute resolving body.This paper intends to introduce the new meaning of the access to justice in the digital era and the significance of the ODR as the future dispute resolution process and its impact on the acess to justice.

Medium-resolution Spectroscopy of Red Giant Branch Stars iniiCentauri,2017,,,"PWe present FeH and CaFe of similar to 600 red giant branch (RGB) members of the globular cluster Omega Centauri (omega Cen). We collect medium-resolution (R similar to 2000) spectra using the Blanco 4 m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory equipped with Hydra, the fiber-fed multi-object spectrograph. We demonstrate that blending of stellar light in optical fibers severely limits the accuracy of spectroscopic parameters in the crowded central region of the cluster. When photometric temperatures are taken in the spectroscopic analysis, our kinematically selected cluster members, excluding those that are strongly affected by flux from neighboring stars, include relatively fewer stars at intermediate metallicity (FeH similar to -1.5) than seen in the previous high-resolution survey for brighter giants in Johnson  Pilachowski. As opposed to the trend of increasing CaFe with FeH found by those authors, our CaFe estimates, based on Ca II H  K measurements, show essentially the same mean CaFe for most of the metal-poor and metal-intermediate populations in this cluster, suggesting that mass- or metallicity-dependent SN II yields may not be necessary in their proposed chemical evolution scenario. Metal-rich cluster members in our sample show a large spread in CaFe, and do not exhibit a clear bimodal distribution in CaFe.

The present study aimed to evaluate the psychological effects of the hydrogen fluoride spill on the members of the community and to investigate their relationships with physical symptoms and changes in psychological effects occurring as time passed after the accident.  Methods The 1st phase involved a survey of 1359 individuals that was conducted 1 month after the spill, and the 2nd phase involved a survey of 711 individuals that was conducted 7 months after the accident. The questionnaires included items for assessing demographic characteristics, hydrogen fluoride exposure level, physical symptoms, and psychological status. Physical symptoms were assessed to determine the persistence of irritations. Psychological status was assessed to investigate the impact of event level using the Impact of Event Scale  Revised Korean version (IES-R-K), and the anxiety level was assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).  Results As the hydrogen fluoride exposure level increased, the impact of event and anxiety levels increased significantly both 1 and 7 months after the accident (p  0.05). The mean score of the impact of event levels decreased significantly from 33.33  14.64 at 1 month after the accident to 28.68  11.80 at 7 months after the accident (p  0.05).

The isothermal-fluidic field of a secondary moderator jet in a  scale CANDU-6 reactor model,2017,"['CANDU', 'Fluidic similarity', 'Moderator circulation', 'Reynolds number independence', 'Secondary jet', 'MCT']",,"PBAbstractBP  PThe steady, isothermal-fluidic field of forced moderator streams in a  scaled moderator circulation tank (MCT) of a CANDU-6 reactor is analysed. Particular focus is placed on characterizing a secondary jet formed by the collision of symmetric, counter flowing wall jets discharged upwards by nozzles installed at each side of the MCTs horizontal axis. Two separate sets of experiments have been conducted employing water and air as the working fluids with different nozzle configurations (i.e., discrete dove-tail nozzles for water and two-dimensional slot jet nozzles for air). Then, cross validation of the fluidic data sets from these two different test facilities have been made where the fluidic similarity of the secondary jet generated by the inlet nozzles (particularly its rate of dissipation as it interacts with the calandria tubes (CTs)) has been established. Based on the established fluidic similarity, a series of numerical simulations have been performed according to the boundary conditions obtained extensively from the two-dimensional MCT experiments. Subsequently, the numerical results have been validated against the experimental data to assess the capability of a commercial code (ANSYS CFX V15.0) to resolve the moderator interaction with the CTs. It has been demonstrated that a monotonic decay of the secondary jet whose peak (having roughly 50 of the nozzles exit mean vertical velocity component) exists at the throat of the first row of the calandria tubes in the MCT takes place. After which, the momentum of the secondary jet is substantially reduced along its centreline. The rate of dissipation of the secondary jet is under-predicted by the default Ik-I SST turbulence model, leading to a dramatic over-prediction of the penetration distance of the secondary jet into the core region. However, the accuracy of the numerical results can be substantially improved with turbulence model parameter tuning to achieve a closer fit with the reference experimental data.P   PBHighlightsBP  P UL LI  There exist secondary jet Reynolds number independence and fluidic similarity.

Even basic reading of is hard but it is certain that this work deals with one figure(Lee Sang)s one day off. This whole day for 24 hours consists of trivial events just like most modern mens daily life. Lee Sangs one day described a bit pointlessly in is mainly made up of images and thoughts aroused by media, and those aroused by stroll(). What particularly catches eyes in the work is the sentences inserted without context, such as written colloquial Chinese, French, English and other foreign languages. Before and after these 7 sentences in total in foreign languages, diverse thoughts are developed, Among them, five written colloquial Chinese sentences deal with the circumstances of those times and Lee Sangs understanding of and reactions to them, and other 2 sentences in western languages, that is, French and English, have cultural contents. In other words, Lee Sang is learning about the time and experiencing the world through the media of books, magazines or movies in his daily life. In addition to reading and thinking, Lee Sangs most important activity is walking in the city. Only sense of sight is emphasized to modern men, and they have been deprived of experiences. In this respect, the two ways how Lee Sang experiences the world are severely modern and they are a modern mans experience of the world. Full experience is impossible in the first place, and experiences exist just as fragmented parts, so the representation of the world which cannot but be created through myself, that is, language, cannot be flawless. Smoothly elaborated language actually deletes beings or events, so the crunching and uncomfortable language in delivers the essence of the world most faithfully in some sense. In , he(Lee Sang, E. teacher Lee Sang with responsibility and duty, K) is expressed in diverse forms. Lee Sangs division, who is splitted into two or three, exposes contradiction of a modern subject itself that actually cannot be a single one. In this division that rejects a clear main agent, hatred and refusal against the life lasting with no meaning are also inherent. Lee Sang is myself of trace that is erased while being written. To this Lee Sang, his way to escape is art.

Direct Perception(pratyaka), the origin of three right means of recognition in Classical Skhya and Yoga schools expands from the pure sense organ-perception(indriya-pratyaka) to the pretersensual Yogis perception(prptiba or yogi-pratyaka). The present writer attempted to find the Epistemological characteristics of Classical Skhya and Yoga only through the magnifying glass of perception(pratyaka). As a result, it was found that the two schools had different characteristics in many ways. The findings are as follows. First, after classifying the organs(indriya) related to perception in Classical Skhya in detail, it was found that Classical Skhya emphasized the role of Buddhi(intelligence), whereas Classical Yoga integrated the internal organs into citta(mind) and discussed its action and how to control it. Second, Classical Skhya explained about the occurrence of perception through contact with sense organ and object, traditional methods, whereas Classical Yoga expressed the reflection of citta through comparison of quartzto magnet and iron.Third, Classical Skhya wasnt clear about self-perception in Vijnavdin, whereas Classical Yoga refused the self-perception(Svasavedana) clearly, thus aiming at Ankrajnavda. Finally, taken the views from the two schools on definition and characteristics of perception together, it can be classified into sense organ-perception, determination-perception and Yogis perception. As this study is just an attempt to identify the Epistemology in the two schools, further researches need to conduct a close study by expanding the scope of study into the entire Epistemology in the future. Nevertheless, it is still hoped that the present writers attempt can be of help for people to take interest in epistemological views from the two schools.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Candrakrti borrows authority from stras (gamdhigama), one of the orthodox styles of argumentation, to interpret cittamtra in Daabhmikastra. In his criticism, by quoting stras, Candrakrti did not read the meaning of the cittamtra in the Daabhmikastra as the vijapti-mtra, the negation of the external object. Bhviveka points out through the twelve links of interdependent origination (dvdauga-prattyasamutpda) that the cittamtra is not for the negation of the external object. Candrakrti does not exhaustively verify the contextual meaning of the three-fold world as cittamtra in the Daabhmikastra and instead explains that the condition of the Vijna is the causality through a natural sequence (anulomkra) and reverse sequence (pratilomkra) as in the Daabhmikastra. He denies the actor as the immortal tman through the principle of the twelve links of interdependent origination and argues that we can know the cittamtra as the actor only in language, but not in reality, in Advancing in the Madhyamakvatra.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Shu Jing, Classic of History, also just abbreviated to Shu, pronounced Seo in Korean) in early Chosun() period are Kwon Geun()s Seo Cheongyeonnok(, Superficial Reflections on Shu Jing) and Yi Hwang()s Seo Seoki(, Commentary on Shu Jing). These two books were written to interpret Shang Shu on the basis of explanatory notes of Shu Ji Zhuan(, A Collection of Comments on the Shu) by Cai Chen() who was one of Zhu Xi()s eminent disciples. The interpretation of Shang Shu on the basis of Shu Ji Zhuan should be preceded by examining and analyzing Shu Ji Zhuan per se. Kim Jangsaeng()s Interpretation of Shang Shu was inherited from the previous achievements of Shang Shu interpretation of early Chosun period represented by Kwon Geun and Yi Hwang, and also written for the purpose of supplemented and intensified examination of Cai Chens commentary on Shu Jing. Kim Jangsaengs Gyeongseo Byeoni on Shu Ji Zhuan(-, The Examination of divergent passages in Chinese Classics - On Cai Chens Collection of Comments on the Shu) has 104 articles in total out of which 82 articles are on the subject of Cai Chens Shu Ji Zhuan, and mainly deals with the problems in Shu Ji Zhuan such as Controversy over Jinwen( current script in Han Dynasty) and Guwen( ancient script) texts, the reliability of forewords to each chapters of Shang Shu called Shuxu(), the problem of first 28 characters in Shun Dian(, Canon of Shun, the second chapter of Shang Shu), and historical research on geographic themes. These topics were also main issues in Cais Shu Ji Zhuan, which shows Kim intended to supplement and rectify Cais deficiencies and faults. In the course of closer examination, Kim had recognized the inaccuracy of Cais Shu Ji Zhuan,, which drove him to suggest the alternative commentaries. This can be regarded as his own line of interpretation of Shang Shu in Chosun dynasty when Cais interpretation had great influence in Shang Shu study. It is also noteworthy that Kim adopted the interpretations of commentaries of Chosun dynastys preceding scholars such as Kwon Geun, Yi Hwang, or Yi I() and comtemporary scholars such as Sin Heum(), Im Sukyeong(), Jeong Hongmyeong(), and that Kims commentary had influenced to Kim Jongjeong()s interpretation of Shang Shu who lived in 18th centurys Chosun dynasty, the era of King Yeonjo() and Jeongjo(). Kim Jangsaengs Gyeongseo Byeoni inherited the preceding interpretation of Shang Shu in early Chosun period such as Kwon Geuns or Yi Hwangs, which intensified and deepened the understanding of Cai Chens interpretation of Shang Shu, and also accepted positively his comtemporary scholars view such as Sin Heum, Im Sukyeong, and Jeong Hongmyeong, which means that he propose the alternative of Cais interpretation.

The samples were collected according to each experimental condition, and the analysis method of SEM-EDX was used to determine the concentration of each metallic element. The comparative analysis indicated that their mass concentration ranged from 1 to 3. The elements in the industrial region that were above 10 were Si, Al, Fe, and Ca. Those below 5 were Na, Mg, and S. The remaining elements (1 of total mass) consisted of elements such as Ni, Co, Br and Pb. Finally, a statistical tool was applied to the elemental results to identify each source for the industrial region. From a principal components analysis (SPSS, Ver 20.0) performed to analyze the possible sources of PM10 in the industrial region, five main factors were determined. Factor 1 (Si, Al), which accounted for 15.8 of the total variance, was mostly affected by soil and dust from manufacturing facilities nearby, Factors 2 (Cu, Ni), 3 (Zn, Pb), and 4 (Mn, Fe), which also accounted for some of variance, were mainly related to iron, non-ferrous metals, and other industrial manufacturing sources. Also, five factors determined to access possible sources of PMsub2.5sub, Factor 1 (Na, S), accounted for 13.5 of the total variance and was affected by sea-salt particles and fuel incineration sources, and Factors 2 (Ti, Mn), 3 (Pb, Cl), 4 (K, Al) also explained significant proportions of the variance.

The responses to increasing seeding rates and various growing conditions such as altitude, accumulated temperature, and soil chemical properties etc, were analyzed by means of the seedling establishment rate, weed occurrence ratio, and shoot biomass yield of hairy vetch. Field experiments were conducted at five citrus orchards by altitude from Sep. 2015 to Apr. 2016 in Jeju Island, Republic of Korea. Hairy vetch used in the study was Cheongpyungbora, developed by National Institute of Crop Science. Seeding rates of hairy vetch consisted of 30, 60 and 90 kg  ha-1. Results showed that the seedling establishment rates of hairy vetch were quite similar regardless of seeding rates in all fields and weed occurrence ratio at 30, 60 and 90 kg  ha-1 of seeding rates were 11.8, 3.8, and 5.1 (dry wt.), respectively. Both 60 and 90 kg  ha-1 of seeding rates, the weed occurrences were decreased by 96.2 and 94.9. The nitrogen production of hairy vetch at 30, 60 and 90 kg  ha-1 of seeding rates were 254, 316, and 315 kg  ha-1, respectively. Both 60 and 90 kg  ha-1 of seeding rates, The nitrogen production were increased by 24, compared to 30 kg  ha-1 of seeding rate. In these results we were considered that the cost-efficient seeding rate of vetch was 60 kg  ha-1 in citrus orchards. Also, this study showed that the shoot biomass of hairy vetch and various cultivative factors were related and The nitrogen production of hairy vetch had a little bit of positive correlation (R0.2714) with accumulated temperature and considerable correlations with some items (EC (R0.4520) and exchangeable K (R0.4078)) of soil chemical properties. Therefore, we were considered that hairy vetch can be used as a leguminous cover crop in citrus orchards, the calculation formula (Y4.4097X  33.594 (R0.9547)) can be suggested for nitrogen yield of hairy vetch by using the shoot fresh weight (X).",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The influence comes from the fact that She has been a practical activist on the various spots of anti-war, anti-nuclear, anti-racism movement and so on. And also in her works especially in her poetry she clarifies that literature and imagination canmust be a powerful weapon for the fights against all the injustices deeply permeated in the modern society.   Broadly speaking, all the justices can be concluded into fairness. But to focus on the justice in the poetry of Le Guin, this paper categorizes justice into three types Social Justice, Environmental Justice, and Ecological Justice. For the social justice, the first step Le Guin takes is the diagnosis of the injustices widespread in the modern society. She points out the mis-recognition of the weak and the low by the established who have monopolized knowledge and information also. The structural injustice in our society is more expanding and deepening in the environmental justice. All the environmental injustices, Le Guin believes, come from the environmental inequality and the inequality from the ignorance and insensibility of the established to the weak. In her poems distance and other place or elsewhere are the metaphor for the ignorance and insensibility. Ecological justice, the last and complete justice, is to be oneness with everything fulfilled by the removing of the ignorance and insensibility. And in her poetry, all the justices are arranged into the ecological justice.   As a poet, Le Guin claims to be a worlds housekeeper. And her house which knows no inequality nor injustice at all is wide open to every direction and every one and every thing under the heaven. As a result, in Le Guins poetry, justice has the exactly same meaning with the open consciousness toward everything in Nature for symbiosis.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

But the cockroach with mustache is nothing but the Stalins double within the context of intertextuality between the two texts. The fact that animals are eating each others under the presure of fear created by the cockroach with mustache in Chukovskys text is overlapping in Ginzburgs text as multilineal betrayals among Soviet citizens disclosing not committed crimes. The cockroachs intention to eat other animals children for suffer is a direct allegory to the childrens death of hunger and cold in Kolyma, including Ginzburgs elder son Alesha.

Prediction of entrained droplet fraction in co-current annular gas-liquid flow in vertical pipes,2017,"['Sauter mean diameter', 'Wire Mesh Sensor', 'Droplet entrainment', 'Large diameter pipes', 'Two-phase flow']",,"PThe entrained droplet fraction is an important parameter in annular two-phase flow, as its correlations are key inputs in flow simulation codes for the prediction of pressure drop and critical heat flux or dryout. Investigators have stressed the importance of extending the validity range of current correlations so that more conditions are covered. This could be achieved for example by including fluids with higher viscosities, a wider range of operating pressures, and increase in the size of pipes used for experiments (most of the data in the literature are from pipes of 50 mm diameter and below). In attempt to improve the latter, experiments were conducted in a 101.6 mm gas liquid flow loop at Cranfield Universitys Oil and Gas Engineering Laboratory and data on the fraction of droplets were collected in the annular flow regime by measuring the film velocity, from which the droplet fraction was calculated. Comparison of the film velocity by this method and by a mass balance showed close agreement. A capacitance Wire Mesh Sensor was used for flow visualisation in order to distinguish between annular and churn flow. In order to arrive at an improved correlation, over 1300 data points were gathered from other published works. These include air water studies where large pipes of up to 127 mm in diameter were used. The others were from small-diameter pipes and for refrigerant, steam water, air water, and air glycerine flows. Since in the annular regime, the gas flow entrains liquid droplets into the core, their presence alters the properties of the gas core. Therefore, accurate predictions are pivotal for the energy efficient design and operation of facilities in the petroleum and nuclear power industry. The correlation obtained here showed good agreement with the collected databank. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.P",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

HisJeokbyeokbujipja Gakchesasipsu was understood in the contexts of trends in the political situations of Joseon in the 17th century and Lee s alternative responses to the political situations. In the 17th century, the dynamic relations of the political power developed in complicated ways around the royal authority. Lee got along and discussed current events with Sambok, a son of Inpyeongdaegun, and left N ak do n gc han g s u r o k . The Seoins raised Gyeongshinhwanguk, citing these activities as an excuse. Once they seized power, the ones on their opposite side were banished to Buryeong, Cheongam, and other places. Lee accepted and reproduced The Battle of the Red Cliff by Su Shi as a way of escaping his suffering. Lee s Jeokbyeokbujipja Gakchesasipsu consists of four Yulsis in 7 Eon, six Yulsis in 5 Eon, ten Jeolgus in 7 and 5 Eon, each, and ten Gosis in 5 Eon, totaling in 1,344 letters. Its organization is in four layers with the semantic paragraphs grouped in ten Yulsis in 7 and 5 Eon, ten Jeonggus in 7 Eon, ten Jeolgus in 5 Eon, and ten Gosis. In terms of expression and content, it shows similar patterns to The Battle of the Red Cliff in the contrast of  Su Shi  and  Lee Seo-woo  and  Red Cliff  and  Blue Rock.  Jeokbyeokbujipja Gakchesasipsu depicts the true nature of Lee s hardship in the political situations of Joseon in the 17th century and his journey of desire as a man to overcome the hardship. His psychology evolves in the process of  recognizing the reality,  internalizing it,  replacing it with something else, and sublimating it. His mental states are replaced and represented by  Su Shi,   Red Cliff,   Seonyu,   Taoist hermit with miraculous powers,   beautiful women,   wings  and  the south,  which appear clear in the contrast of  Su Shi  and  Lee Seo-woo,   Red Cliff  in Hwangju and  Blue Wall  in Cheongam,   Taoist hermit with miraculous powers  and  human being  and  south  and  east.  In Jeokbyeokbujipja Gakchesasipsu, Hanyang is established in a sign system opposite to Cheongam set as a world of Taoist hermits with miraculous powers. Lee has such a yearning for returning back to Hanyang by escaping Cheongam at the northern tip of the country and imagines a world of Taoist hermits with miraculous powers on the way to Hanyang or a medium space via Su Shi and the Red Cliff. Hanyang is the place where his ideal of ego lies, and he longs for Hanyang and the world of Taoist hermits with miraculous powers to emerge as an ideal ego. His psychological changes can be understood in a process of activating his self-defense mechanism. That is, it is his psychological action to erase the negative reality by yearning for, recalling, and internalizing Su Shi, replace his spiritual pain before his eyes, and turn it into positive life energy. The patterns of constructing and dissolving the spatial sign system in his Jeokbyeokbujipja Gakchesasipsu imply such desire of his in a consistent manner.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

The planting material was used in two ways reflecting only the ecological characteristics of the plant, and considering the ecological and visual characteristics together. Vegetation plantings reflecting the ecological characteristics were observed in all eleven spaces. Nine of the spaces reflected the growth environment of the plants, but the other two did not reflect the ecological characteristics of the plants, unlike the designers intention. In the case of the four spaces that considered the ecological and visual characteristics together, color and size were considered visual characteristics. The plants in the seven spaces that included expression as the theme were selected to reflect the visual characteristics in the order of color, shape, texture, and size, rather than reflecting ecological characteristics. A group planting method was applied. When the plants were used as materials for creating space, Norman(1989) analyzed three enclosure factors(overhead, vertical, ground plane). Only two deciduous trees were used in the overhead plane while five species of evergreen shrubs and thirty species of various deciduous plants were used in the vertical plane. There were forty-five species (nine trees and thirty-six herbaceous plants) forming the ground plane, and various herbaceous plants were utilized without duplication in each garden. The designers garden of the Garden Show played a role in introducing new groundcover plants to the public. Three of the nine gardens did not include ornamental plants, and the use of decorative plants in other gardens was few compared to the number of plantings. In the Korea Garden Show designers garden, most of the plants were being used with the intention of exposing the theme or architectural uses. In the 2016 Korea Garden Show designers garden, many species of plants were used as materials for showcasing themes rather than for creating spaces. Also, the method of expression was used more than the method of representation in order to highlight the theme. This indicates that the planting materials reflect visual characteristics such as color, shape, texture, size rather than ecological characteristics.",k-means_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
An Efficient Vision-based Object Detection and Tracking using Online Learning,2017,"['Object detection', 'object tracking', 'semi-supervised learning', 'real-time processing']",,"In this paper, we propose a vision-based object detection and tracking system using online learning. The proposed system adopts a feature point-based method for tracking a series of inter-frame movement of a newly detected object, to estimate rapidly and toughness. At the same time, it trains the detector for the object being tracked online. Temporarily using the result of the failure detector to the object, it initializes the tracker back tracks to enable the robust tracking. In particular, it reduced the processing time by improving the method of updating the appearance models of the objects to increase the tracking performance of the system. Using a data set obtained in a variety of settings, we evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of processing time.",supervised_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017
"To Be Conservative as a Disposition of Education Familiarity, Freedom and Learning from the Perspective of Michael Oakeshott",2017,"['익숙함', '보수적 성향', '행위 전통', '자유', '실용교육', '자유교육', 'familiarity', 'the conservative disposition', 'tradition of behaviour', 'freedom', '‘vocational education’', 'liberal learning']",,"Purpose The purpose of this study is chiefly to interpret and clarify a traditionally notion of the conservative disposition concealed in liberal education by reviewing three basic conceptsfamiliarity, freedom and learningfrom the perspective of Michael Oakeshott. Method Firstly, we discover that there are two intractable crises in education on account of the observation of history and current situations. The first relates to the sustainability of the conservative disposition and the second to the invitation of liberal learning. They are organically interconnected in that the realisation of the latter, in a way, relies on a response to the acquisition of the former. Secondly, we define familiarity as a characteristic of the conservative disposition that derives from the enjoyment of the present through an examination of complex social conditions. Familiarity is the basis of a conservative disposition that runs through the whole tradition of behaviour, or rather the tradition of morality derives its inheritance as a way of understanding education. Thirdly, we systematically expound that the conservative disposition as an essential component of education activities is supposed not only to provide the basis for educational enterprise but to play a role that involves a relationship between teachers and students. Fourthly, we emphasize the pivotal role of the conservative disposition not only in restraining the hegemony of the pragmatic modes of education but in providing a strong guarantee for realizating the invitation of liberal education by criticizing vocational education. Results Finally, we put forward the conservative disposition of freedom as a reflective consciousness that plays an irreplaceable role in supervising and advancing the development of liberal learning by virtue of Oakeshotts perception of freedom. Conclusion The discussion of Oakeshotts concept of the conservative disposition, which deepens the importance and necessity of liberal education, can furtherly make a contribution to the re-establishment for the orientation of educational activities, as well as for the trusting relationship between learners and teachers in modern education.",supervised_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Iterative classification based on semi-supervised learning is applied to extract reliable training data from both the initial classification result with a small number of training data, and classification results of adjacent pixels are also considered to extract new training pixels with less uncertainty. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed method, a case study of the classification of field crops was carried out using multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI acquired in the Daehongdan region, North Korea. From a case study, the misclassification of crops and forests, and isolated pixels in the initial classification result were greatly reduced by applying the proposed semi-supervised learning method. In addition, the combination of classification results of adjacent pixels for the extraction of new training data led to the great reduction of both misclassification results and isolated pixels, compared to the initial classification and traditional semi-supervised learning results. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed method would be effectively applied to classify areas in which it is difficult to collect sufficient training data.",supervised_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

One is the Commentary on Great Learning() by 17th century Vietnamese scholar Le Quy Don, and the other is Public Discussions on Great Learning() by Joseon Confucian scholar Tasan Jeong Yag-yong.The Commentary on Great Learning is a part of Abbreviated Commentaries on Four Books() which is designed to give a phonetic guidance and simple explanation of the classics for public readers. Although this is not Le Quy Dons original publication, he has supervised and acknowledged its contents and value. Tasans Public Discussions on Great Learning, on the other hand, is a collection of scholarly discussions and exegesis on Great Learning in which the authors innovative perspective and unique interpretations are visible.As for the contents, Le Quy Dons understanding of Great Learning mainly follows Zhu Xis neo-Confucian framework. It does contain, nevertheless, some unique commentaries of its own for instance, extending knowledge is interpreted as extending ones innate good knowing Moreover, the prime agent subject of practicing ethical virtue(filial piety, brotherly respect, benevolent love) is the king or lord, not the common people. Also metaphysical discussions are removed and practical details are added instead. Tasans understanding on Great Learning is more radical in the sense that he criticized Zhu Xis system altogether. He believed that the old version of Great Learning should be preserved word for word. Zhu Xis emphasis on the investigating things and extending knowledge part of Great Learning, hence, must be re-considered that the whole process of self-cultivation should be in six steps, not eight. For Tasan, the point of Great Learning is to show the kingly way to govern the state and bring peace to the world, which is to exhort three ethical virtues() among its people.During the 17th to 18th century, Vietnam and Joseon Confucian scholars began to distance themselves from Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucian influence and start to embrace other thought-streams.

It, however, is not a matter of theoretical and institutional validity, but a matter of constitutional choice reflecting the different circumstances of each country.  In the East Asian countries, the different types of constitutional adjudication system have been chosen and developed even though they have similar legal traditions and judicial systems. In the process, they have faced various challenges, but they have consistently moved towards the direction of normalization and revitalization of their constitutional adjudication systems as they have more realized the importance of the fundamental rights in their constitutions. They have examined and tried various ways of improving their constitutional adjudication systems.  In the case of Japan, in order to overcome the problems of long and passive nature of decentralized constitutional review, it is discussed that the separate chamber within the Supreme Court or the independent Constitutional Court should be set up in oder to deal with the consitutional matters. In the face of domestic and international demands for the protection of human rights and the rule of law, China is also moving away from the existing political consitutional supervision and considering to introduce the constitutional review by the judiciary or establish an independent and specialized institution for constitutional supervision. Mongolia and Taiwan also maintain the existing centralized and decentralized institutional system respectively, while in Mongolia, the political constitutional tradition of the socialist constitutional tradition has been cleared away and the independent Constitutional Court was set up and in Taiwan, there has been a plan to improve the system by normalizing the functions of the Judicial Yuan in interpreting the Constitution.  In the case of Korea, there is no doubt for the general direction of improving the constitutional adjudication system by normalizing and revitalizing the system since the problem that has been revealed while running the present constitutional adjudication system for almost 30 years and its improvement plan are said so. In our case, however, there is a big difference from the experiences of other countries as we have learned from a great deal of trials and errors from choosing the wrong systems in the past over about 70 years before the current system was finally adopted in 1987. For this reason, it is absolutely incomprehensible to discard the current centralized model and return to the old system of the decentralized model. On the contrary, it is necessary to more develop the current system by allowing the constitutional control over the judgments of the ordinary courts which is not possible in our current system. This should lead to improve the fundamental rights of people which are enshrined in our Constitution by allowing the constitutional control over all spheres of government power.",supervised_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Multi-Level and Multi-Scale Feature Aggregation Using Pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks for Music Auto-Tagging,2017,,,"PMusic auto-tagging is often handled in a similar manner to image classification by regarding the two-dimensional audio spectrogram as image data. However, music auto-tagging is distinguished from image classification in that the tags are highly diverse and have different levels of abstraction. Considering this issue, we propose a convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based architecture that embraces multi-level and multi-scaled features. The architecture is trained in three steps. First, we conduct supervised feature learning to capture local audio features using a set of CNNs with different input sizes. Second, we extract audio features from each layer of the pretrained convolutional networks separately and aggregate them altogether giving a long audio clip. Finally, we put them into fully connected networks and make final predictions of the tags. Our experiments show that using the combination of multi-level and multi-scale features is highly effective in music auto-tagging and the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on the MagnaTagATune dataset and the Million Song Dataset.

The mix design proportion for waste LCD glass and the compressive strength relationship is complex and nonlinear. This results in a prediction weakness for the multivariable regression model during the initial growing phase of the compressive strength of waste LCD glass concrete. Thus, the R ratio for the predictive multivariable regression model is 0.96. Neural networks (NN) have a superior ability to handle nonlinear relationships between multiple variables by incorporating supervised learning. This study developed a multivariable prediction model for the determination of waste LCD glass concrete compressive strength by analyzing a series of laboratory test results and utilizing a neural network algorithm that was obtained in a related prior study. The current study also trained the prediction model for the compressive strength of waste LCD glass by calculating the effects of several types of factor combinations, such as the different number of input variables and the relevant filter for input variables. These types of factor combinations have been adjusted to enhance the predictive ability based on the training mechanism of the NN and the characteristics of waste LCD glass concrete. The selection priority of the input variable strategy is that evaluating relevance is better than adding dimensions for the NN prediction of the compressive strength of WLGC. The prediction ability of the model is examined using test results from the same data pool. The R ratio was determined to be approximately 0.996. Using the appropriate input variables from neural networks, the model validation results indicated that the model prediction attains greater accuracy than the multivariable regression model during the initial growing phase of compressive strength. Therefore, the neural-based predictive model for compressive strength promotes the application of waste LCD glass concrete.",supervised_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

To reduce the labeling costs, many studies have been conducted on weakly supervised learning, where only video-level action labels exist, but it has limitations due to the absence of frame-level annotations. Recently, research has been conducted on point annotation-based learning, which can achieve much improved performance while reducing labeling costs. However, this has a limitation in that the performance depends the location of annotated points in the action interval. To compensate for this, we design a probability distribution that can represent action intervals, which allows us to sample point annotations and update them to gradually move point annotations toward the center of action intervals as learning progresses.

Six certified counselling psychologists with fewer than five years of both counselling and supervisory experience were selected as participants of the study. The results found that novice supervisors have difficulty adjusting to their supervisory role since they transitioned only recently from supervisee to supervisor, and they accepted the supervisor role merely because their supervisees requested supervision from them. Although novice supervisors feel ambivalent toward their supervisees, they meticulously prepare supervisory session and feedback and are willing to continue supervision as their supervisees exhibit a high level of motivation and passion for learning from them.Data analysis reveal that supervisory experience increased novice supervisors level of intellectual curiosity, which in turn improved their expertise in counselling. Over time, novice supervisors developed individualized, personalized supervision training methods through self-reflection as well as confidence in their supervisees professional growth.To novice supervisors, supervisory experience is an important step towards growth on a professional level and positive change on a personal level.

Forty two written prayers are included in the book, and the prayers are classified by five different ritual categories sacrificial rites(15), wedding ceremonies(4), funeral rites(11), ancestral rites(7), and miscellaneous ceremonies(5). Most prayers are definitely directed towards Heaven-Earth-Human Parents who are anthropomorphized as supreme beings in ritual dimension. The answerers of prayer are personified deities who represent at once and supervise three cosmic elements heaven, earth, and human. In fact, the main and large part of Donghakgyos ritual process is reading several written prayers one by one and then burning them. It is not too much to say that the reading and burning of written prayers is the alpha and omega of the rituals. In Donghakgyo, both a ritual without written prayers and a ritual manual without a prayer manual are almost unimaginable.",supervised_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Slow Feature Analysis for Mitotic Event Recognition,2017,"['Slow feature analysis', 'mitotic event recognition', 'hidden conditional random field']",,"Mitotic event recognition is a crucial and challenging task in biomedical applications. In this paper, we introduce the slow feature analysis and propose a fully-automated mitotic event recognition method for cell populations imaged with time-lapse phase contrast microscopy. The method includes three steps. First, a candidate sequence extraction method is utilized to exclude most of the sequences not containing mitosis. Next, slow feature is learned from the candidate sequences using slow feature analysis. Finally, a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) model is applied for the classification of the sequences. We use a supervised SFA learning strategy to learn the slow feature function because the strategy brings image content and discriminative information together to get a better encoding. Besides, the HCRF model is more suitable to describe the temporal structure of image sequences than nonsequential SVM approaches. In our experiment, the proposed recognition method achieved 0.93 area under curve (AUC) and 91 accuracy on a very challenging phase contrast microscopy dataset named C2C12.",supervised_learning_2017_academic_riss.csv,2017

Previous South Korean governments had made progress in reforming the military by focusing on building a low-cost highly-efficient military strength, an efficient military structure, and detering war and in the event of war to come out victorious by a solidified combined defense system. The conservative-sided government had preferred a central combined military system focused on the Army, and the progressive-sided had preferred sequestration of the Army and a balanced development of all three military branches. However, no government have yet to resolve problems that stand between them and objectives to achieve military reformation. On the contrary, joint military strength has diminished due to deepened conflict between the Army and the NavyAir Force. Moon Jae-Ins administration, therefore, should learn from previous governments attempts and materialize its purpose. First, development of a new NavyAir Force centered warfighting concept will be needed. Second, the current Joint Chiefs of Staff Command should be separated into Joint Chiefs of Staff Command and Joint Forces Command Joint Chiefs of Staff Command responsible for the supervision of military orders, while Joint Forces Command exercises executive power over military orders.
